0,abstract0," Background: In recent years, the scientific community has been paying ever more attention to the promotion of lifestyles aimed at the prevention of late toxicities related to anti-cancer treatments. Methods: Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL)) researchers conducted a systematic review in order to evaluate the evidence in favor of the promotion of lifestyles aimed at the prevention of the main sequelae of long-term classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)) in survivors treated at adulthood with first-line or second-line therapy, including autologous stem cell transplants (autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT)s). Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched up to December 2020. Results: Seven studies were ultimately included in this systematic review; some of them were eligible for multiple population/intervention/control/outcome/study design (PICOS).",c524e1e0-130b-4818-b4fd-d2c2999269d5
1,abstract1," The majority of the studies emerged from data extraction regarding cHL; less evidence resulted for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors. Five studies in favor of physical activity provided consistent data for a reduction of the cardiovascular risk in cHL and also in survivors who underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT). A beneficial effect of physical activity in reducing chronic fatigue was found. Being overweight was associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease in cHL survivors in one of the two eligible studies. Studies aiming to evaluate the impact of the Mediterranean diet on late toxicities and secondary cancers were lacking. Tailored survivorship care plans (survivorship care plans (SCP)) seemed to represent an optimal tool to guide the follow-up and promote healthier lifestyles in the one eligible study. Thus, promotion of healthy lifestyles and empowering of lymphoma survivors should be implemented through structured models.",99864278-15b5-413a-b06e-9401f5c71f8d

Introduction  Survivorship is becoming an important issue of cancer care. It is estimated that the number of cancer survivors has now reached more than 16 million in U.S.A. and 12 million in Europe, and has shown a constant increase over time [1,2,3,4,5]. The majority of survivors have been cured for breast, prostate or colorectal cancer, or melanoma—accounting for about the 58% of survivors [2]. In the context of hematological neoplasms, lymphomas represent the population with the greatest survival rate (free from therapy), thanks to the constant amelioration of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies [3,4,5,6,7].  Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) usually manifests in the second or third decade of life, with an incidence of 2.3–2.",46716542-ebf3-4afe-a7fd-9773a5975d01
3,abstract3,"6 new cases/100,000/year [8,9]. The disease in now curable in at least 80% of patients, with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 88% [8,9,10]. It represents one of the cancers for which a remarkable improvement has been observed in the last 40 years [10]. Long-term survivors of cHL have been generally treated with conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and data on the long-term toxicity of new drugs will be known in a short time [8,10]. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)) is the most common lymphoid neoplasm in adults, and accounts for about the 40% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma (non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)). Its incidence ranges from 3.8 to 5.6/100,000/year, with a median age at diagnosis of 65–70 years [9]. The 5-year OS is actually 60–64% [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].",26ede311-84f1-43a4-8982-9b41db2bc3ce
4,abstract4," Survivors of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have been treated in the majority of cases with standard induction chemotherapy based on a CHOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicine, prednisone) or rituximab-CHOP regimen according to the historical period. Salvage chemotherapy and consolidation with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT)) represent the second-line treatments for eligible patients with cHL or diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [11,12]. These two cohorts then constitute the prevalent populations of long-term lymphoma survivors [3] and thus the population to which the systematic review we present has been addressed.  Long-term lymphoma survivors could develop a series of late sequelae, mainly represented by cardiovascular, endocrine–metabolic and neurological toxicities; secondary cancers; and infertility [13,14].",5cc0d1d1-6957-4898-9de5-85047af826d5
5,abstract5," The genesis of these late toxicities is multi-factorial and could be related to two main groups of risk factors: (i) non-modifiable factors: chemotherapy, radiation therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT), family history and age [15,16]; and (ii) modifiable factors, such as unhealthy lifestyle factors [17,18].  Lifestyles represent an emerging topic both in cancer prevention and in the prevention of late sequelae after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In this context, it is essential to identify the unhealthy lifestyles of long-term survivors in order to ameliorate educational and preventive measures, reduce the risk of subsequent diseases and improve quality of life (QoL). Most of the published experiences in this sense concern patients who had solid tumors—in particular, breast and colorectal cancers. For some cancer types, a healthy lifestyle has been associated with reduced risks of recurrence and mortality [2].",581e0d64-66e8-4d0e-b14f-8f706ce0bf0c
6,abstract6," In the subset of cancer survivorship, individual lifestyle behaviors, such as maintaining normal bodyweight, physical activity, smoking and diet quality, have been associated with reduced mortality [19,20]. The meta-analysis by Mishra et al. demonstrated a beneficial effect of exercise on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 40 trials, including heterogeneous cohorts of cancer survivors [21].  Currently, there are not structured indications either for the monitoring of late sequelae in lymphoma survivors or for their prevention by adopting healthy lifestyles, but onco-hematologists refer to cancer survivors’ guidelines in general [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22].",31b2d54f-146a-415d-88bf-7bb0542a9c88
7,abstract7," According to these guidelines, it is advised that cancer survivors adhere to regular physical activity (at least 150 min of moderate or 75 min of intense physical activity per week), to a Mediterranean diet, control bodyweight and abolish smoking [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. Several studies suggest a high prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle factors among lymphoma survivors and the positive effects of healthy lifestyles on different clinical outcomes. For example, about two thirds of patients seem not to perform regular physical activity (75.3%) [18,25] or follow the Mediterranean diet (89%); one third are overweight (BMI 25–29.9, 30.8%) or obese (BMI > 30, 26.4%); and 15.7% keep up smoking habits [9]. In several patients (64.7%), multiple unhealthy lifestyle factors are present [18,26].",587e9ada-eba8-466b-9894-8d821ca9b254
8,abstract8," Similar features were also reported in a large cohort of long-term lymphoma survivors after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) and were associated with more comorbidities [27]. Some unhealthy lifestyle factors seem to affect different aspects of the patient’s life. It has been reported that regular physical activity ameliorates QoL and improves psychological and physical fitness in cHL and non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) survivors [25,26,28]. Moreover, a large population study conducted on 3970 B-non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) showed that normal bodyweight is associated with a reduced risk of developing diabetes mellitus [29]. Obesity represented a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in a cohort of 2617 5-year cHL survivors [30]. Survivors of non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who met the American Cancer Society’s (American Cancer Society’s (ACS)) health-related guidelines appeared to have better QoL and less incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder [24,26].",ec78d0fd-8523-4d92-bd38-0e270f02a3e9
9,abstract9," Chronic fatigue has been documented in about 30% of cHL survivors and is associated with early cognitive impairment [31,32]. In some cases, it has been shown that the modification of lifestyles, i.e., the introduction of regular physical activity, may reduce many of these late events [33,34].  In the last few years, survivorship care plans (survivorship care plans (SCP)) have been developed as an instrument able to guide the follow-up of cancer survivors in a more homogeneous and standardized way [35]. Each survivorship care plans (SCP) includes a summary of the oncologic history and comorbidities; the indications for detecting late recurrences of the hematologic disease and monitoring of long-term toxicities; and the recommendations for secondary cancer screening and vaccinations. survivorship care plans (SCP) should also contain tips for a healthy lifestyle.",a295a7df-4db8-4307-a857-3fc6ac917726
10,abstract10," Despite the existence of electronic systems for the generation of survivorship care plans (SCP), these tools are not yet routinely applied during the follow-up of lymphoma survivors [15]. According to Majhail et al., the application of survivorship care plans (SCP) to a population of patients after autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant ameliorated QoL and reduced distress levels [36]. The use of comprehensive survivorship care plans (SCP) could determine greater compliance with screening exams for secondary cancers and late toxicities, and greater adherence to healthy lifestyles, thereby increasing patients’ empowerment. An advanced model of nationwide survivorship care plans (SCP) is represented by the Dutch BETER consortium, which is ongoing and has the aim of educating the population of cHL survivors about the late effects of treatments [37].",bd43f77a-ec2b-48a3-b03d-23ba1fc76be2
11,abstract11,"  With these premises, Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL)) researchers aimed to evaluate, through a systematic review of the literature, possible correlations between lifestyles and late sequelae of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in a population of long-term cHL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors. The reasons for the inclusion of these two populations in the systematic review, which have been extensively discussed within the multi-disciplinary working group, resided in the epidemiology, the cure rates and the possibility of analyzing cohorts of homogeneous and homogeneously treated patients, for whom long-term toxicities are more evaluable. The following late toxicities were considered in the search: cardiovascular, endocrine–metabolic (diabetes, metabolic syndrome/sarcopenia/osteoporosis), neurological (chronic fatigue/neuropathy/cognitive impairment) and secondary cancers. Possible correlations with QoL and OS have also been sought.",0f412350-9330-4b20-a69a-c7993ea5a521

13,methods0," This systematic review is part of a series of analyses exploring the management and follow-up of long-term lymphoma survivors and supporting the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) position statements. The scope of the position statements, the clinical questions and the population/intervention/control/outcome/study design (population/intervention/control/outcome/study design (PICOS)) for each question were discussed and agreed on by the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) “Long-term Survivors Committee” and presented at the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) congress in 2019 (details on clinical questions and population/intervention/control/outcome/study design (PICOS) are reported in Table 1.

14,methods1," Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) researchers have been supported by a methods team, including three expert researchers in clinical research methodology and systematic reviews (Centre for Health Regulatory Istituto Di Ricerche Farmacologiche “Mario Negri”, Milan).  2.1. Study Identification  MEDLINE (via PubMed), the Cochrane Library and EMBASE were systematically searched from January 1990 to December 2020, with no language or publication type restrictions. Search terms included extensive controlled vocabulary (MeSH and EMTREE); and free-text keywords, combining the conditions (classical Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma), interventions (e.g., chemotherapy and radiotherapy) and outcomes of interest (e.g., cardiotoxicity, metabolic syndrome and fatigue). Details on the search strategies can be found in Supplementary Material S1.",8c3ff19b-b712-4b2f-9b01-4c05c7cf9818
15,methods2," We checked the reference lists of relevant studies to retrieve further studies and congress abstracts and searched study registries for unpublished or ongoing studies.  2.2. Eligibility Criteria  We included both primary studies (randomized controlled trials; prospective and retrospective cohort studies; and registry studies) and systematic reviews including these study designs. We included studies involving long-term (≥5 years disease-free or treatment-free) adult (≥18 years-old at diagnosis) cHL or diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors. Included studies assessed the impact of modifiable healthy lifestyle factors on the incidence and outcomes of long-term effects on cardiac function, metabolic syndrome/diabetes/sarcopenia/osteoporosis, chronic fatigue/neuropathy/cognitive impairment, secondary cancers, QoL and OS.",94ff86e4-fc2e-4092-b660-6ed53608f723
16,methods3," In parallel, we evaluated the impact of the application of programmed survivorship care plans (SCP) on the above-mentioned outcomes and on the compliance with secondary cancer screenings. The evaluation focused on patients treated with first-line therapy or second-line therapy, including autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT); allogeneic stem cell transplant was an exclusion criterion.  2.3. Study Selection and Data Extraction  One reviewer screened the titles and abstracts to select the studies; reviewed the full-text publications to confirm the eligibility; and extracted the relevant information from the included trials (C.M.). A second reviewer checked the eligibility and the data extraction to increase the accuracy of the process (A.B.). Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus and arbitration by a third author (G.C.).",fe1bb6aa-fb28-4e3c-8337-65c7967f2218

A predefined spreadsheet (Excel 2007, Microsoft Corporation®) was used for data extraction. Data selection and extraction are presented in Supplementary Material S2.  2.4. Risk of Bias and Quality of Evidence Assessment  We assessed the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews using the AMSTAR 2 tool [39]; the risk of bias for the RCTs using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (Risk of Bias (ROB)) [40]; and the quality of cohort, case-control and registry studies using the New Castle Ottawa Scale [41].",d280c11a-48b3-4550-83c1-04509d1f35f3

19,methods6," After removing duplicates, 401 abstracts were assessed for eligibility and 41 were admitted to subsequent assessment. Of these, five studies were included in the final analysis after full-text evaluation. The main reasons for exclusion were: the presence of a pooled population including different histotypes of non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); a population not matching the definition of long-term survivorship; the lack of an intervention impacting on outcome. Details of the screening process, including reasons for full-text exclusion, are reported in Figure 1 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta analyses (PRISMA) flow-chart).  Four studies were conducted from 1999 to 2014 [30,31,42,43], and the period of evaluation was not reported for the remaining one [44]. Four studies focused on cHL survivors [30,31,42,44] and one on the population of long-term survivors after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) [43].",1fc3d1cd-7eb3-4607-8ae5-a47ba624812f
20,methods7,"  One nested case-control study presented the cardiovascular late toxicity outcome and discussed the impacts of lifestyle factors [30] in a large cohort of 2617 5-year cHL survivors treated between 1965 and 1995. Follow-up was complete up to October, 2013. The study evaluated the risk of coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) as the first cardiovascular event after lymphoma, according to the radiation dose to the heart and type of chemotherapy. An estimate of the in-field irradiated heart volume was calculated via radiation charts and simulation radiographs. Other clinical and lifestyle factors were collected from medical records and from mailed questionnaires completed by the general practitioners (70% of responses). From the whole cohort, 325 survivors reported a coronary heart disease (CHD) as the first event (median interval from lymphoma: 19 years).",85f7f0ec-4e2e-457d-8dc6-213a9d1ad4d7
21,methods8," For each patient with coronary heart disease (CHD), four controls who had not developed cardiac disease and were matched for sex, age and date of HL diagnosis, had been selected (n = 1204). Treatments were variable but controlled for both case and control with multivariate regression analysis. In response to our population/intervention/control/outcome/study design (PICOS), the authors reported that a higher level of physical activity at the time of the follow-up questionnaire was associated with decreased coronary heart disease (CHD) risk (RR 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.83). Patients who performed physical activity (>3 h/week of walking, cycling or sports) had considerably lower risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) than inactive patients (<1 h/week). The authors concluded that early management of cardiovascular risk factors and encouragement of physical activity might reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) in cHL survivors [30].",3d12dcb1-fe8c-4066-aeee-22158f89247e
22,methods9," The overall quality of the study, according to the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS)), was high, due to an optimal case definition and representativeness; good selection of controls; comparability and ascertainment of exposure of cases and controls; and the method of evaluation of the exposure.  The remaining three studies conducted in the cHL survivor population evaluated the correlation between physical activity and chronic fatigue [31,42,44]. In the cross-sectional study by Ng et al., lower physical activity frequency was found to be associated with increased chronic fatigue in 511 cHL survivors (median 15 years from diagnosis, median age at evaluation 44). Patients were treated from 1969 to 1996. The levels of fatigue were measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire (60.6% of responses). Cardiac disease, tobacco use and psychiatric condition were also associated with referred chronic fatigue.",b9b67685-8500-4152-a790-166eef20978c
23,methods10," The control population was represented by patients’ siblings, a non-exposed population [42]. The quality according to the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) of this study was in general intermediate. The case definition was good; however, the selection and exposure of controls were not optimal; the main bias was represented by the self-reported exposure.  A cohort study involved 476 cHL survivors treated from 1971 to 1997, evaluated for the presence of chronic fatigue during the follow-up through the Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ). The frequency of physical activity did not differ among cHL patients experiencing fatigue (30%) compared to cHL not experiencing fatigue. In comparison with the general population (56,999 Norwegian people), male cHL survivors reported increased levels of physical activity, thereby probably contributing to the negative association [31].",61e8e9e9-e796-428e-be9c-9f66aeafe0e8
24,methods11," A pilot cohort study confirmed the efficacy of physical activity in reducing chronic fatigue (measured by FQ) in a small population of cHL survivors. The study involved nine fatigued subjects enrolled in a home-based exercise intervention lasting 20 weeks; no controls were considered in the analysis [44]. According to the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), the first study was intermediate in quality, and the last was low in quality.  The last cross-sectional study was conducted in a population of long-term survivors after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) [43]. This study included 194 long-term survivors treated from 1987 to 2008 (mean follow-up 10.2 months) and who were not affected by heart failure. They underwent cardio-respiratory fitness measurements, which were reported in peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and correlated with medical records and lifestyle factors. The VO2peak in the study population was globally lower than in the general matched population.",4168a988-c508-442d-a422-a1945b051341
25,methods12," A direct correlation with physical exercise was found: Inactive survivors presented a significantly lower percent predicted (PP) VO2peak (females: PP 87.5, 95% CI 78.8–96.3; males: PP 85.8, 95% CI 82.0–89.7) than the general population. Values of patients performing regular physical exercise did not differ from those of the reference population (females: PP 105.6, 95% CI 94.8–116.5; males: PP 100.9, 95% CI 94.0–107.8). This benefit was also confirmed for patients who had received doxorubicin, whose late effect was mitigated in moderately and highly active people [43]. It should be noted that the study lacked detailed reporting on histotypes of non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and therefore did not allow us to assess which outcomes referred to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).",0658ddd7-1e1b-4f68-af94-10d4f56fa119
26,methods13," However, the study met the inclusion criteria, was unique in the subset of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) and provided remarkable conclusions in reference to specific chemotherapeutic agents, e.g., doxorubicin. The quality of this study (Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS)) was globally high: the representativeness, selection and exposure were good, as were the measurements of the outcome and the duration of the follow-up.  3.2. Mediterranean Diet/Nutritional Intervention: Does a Controlled Diet (Mediterranean Diet or Nutritional Plan/Intervention) Determine a Clinical Benefit in Long-Term cHL or diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) Survivors?  We screened 88 abstracts, and then four relevant publications were retrieved as full text. All these publications were excluded from the final analysis because the populations did not correspond perfectly to the population/intervention/control/outcome/study design (PICOS) (n = 3) or the outcome was not evaluable (n = 1).",05ef2e04-1c57-47f0-8864-cdf96947715e
27,methods14," Details of the whole screening process, including reasons for full-text exclusion, are reported in Figure 2 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta analyses (PRISMA) flow-chart).

Of the whole population, 1990 patients responded to a patient-reported questionnaire (median age at treatment 29 years; median follow-up duration 14 years). The analysis showed that BMI ≥ 30 was not statistically significant as a risk factor for cardiac disease (OR 1.3 95%CI 0.9–1.8) [45].

Data on chronic fatigue have partially been reported in Section 3.1. No other lifestyle factors than physical exercise seem to have a beneficial role in the prevention of chronic fatigue in the selected population. As already exposed, the largest studies presented contrasting results: the first showed a beneficial role [42] and the second one highlighted no role [31] of physical activity in chronic fatigue in long-term cHL survivors.

The main reasons for the exclusion were: the population did not correspond perfectly with the population/intervention/control/outcome/study design (PICOS) (n = 3); the outcome was not evaluable (n = 3); the intervention was missing or not specified (n = 1).",e06e6abc-2e52-4791-821c-2c597c5a53e7
34,methods21," Details of the whole screening process, including reasons for full-text exclusion, are reported in Figure 6 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta analyses (PRISMA) flow-chart).  The included study was a prospective cohort study, published as an abstract, with relevant limitations. The main outcome of the analysis was to enhance the awareness and adoption of healthy lifestyles in a population of cHL survivors through a nurse-led survivorship intervention, including the development and delivery of a tailored survivorship care plans (SCP), and an evaluation by the General Health Index and Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II at four time points. The nurse-led consultations also included an education package tailored to individuals’ health needs. This study was published in 2013 and recruited 30 cHL survivors and 30 healthy controls.",c5cc4d85-b844-4fee-b527-cd22378e91a2
35,methods22," In response to the defined population/intervention/control/outcome/study design (PICOS), from baseline to six months post-intervention, statistically significant benefits were detected for some domains: improvement of physical activity (p = 0.014); nutrition (p = 0.0005); health promoting lifestyle (p = 0.005). The intervention was feasible and demonstrated significant potential to improve awareness of health status and healthy lifestyle behaviors in this subset of patients [46]. It cannot be concluded that the benefits presented by the patients were due only to the administration of the survivorship care plans (SCP), but that the consultations and the educational package may have played a synchronous role. The quality of this study was generally low due to the unclear process of selection of cases and the definition of controls. Results have been partially reported and no full text is currently available.",256d56f5-41e4-4061-8b04-117be11ce437
36,methods23,"  No other study specifically tailored to the beneficial role of survivorship care plans (SCP) in the population of cHL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) long-term survivors was found through the revision process.  4. Discussion  This systematic review allowed us to evaluate the efficacy of the adherence to healthy lifestyles among the population of cHL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors. It highlighted modifiable lifestyle factors which through appropriate counseling could lead to the education and empowerment of the patient. These modifiable factors are represented by physical activity according to guidelines (at least 150 min of moderate or 75 intense physical activity per week), a Mediterranean diet or balanced nutrition and appropriate bodyweight (BMI < 25) [2,23,24,47,48].",c0f35ab2-2a67-4d13-b7e2-5dc1fe0376f7
37,methods24," The aim was to verify any study designed to assess the impacts of these risk factors on the more frequent long-term toxicities in cHL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors (cardiovascular toxicity, secondary cancer, metabolic toxicities, chronic fatigue and cognitive impairment) and general outcomes (QoL and OS).  The systematic review showed that the most studied population consisted of cHL survivors, and to a lesser extent of survivors after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT). The only lifestyle factor for which there are consistent data is physical activity. In fact, it correlated with a clinical benefit in terms of reduction of cardiovascular risk. CHL survivors who regularly performed physical exercise presented an inferior risk of developing coronary heart disease [30]. Moreover, lymphoma survivors who performed physical activity after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) showed an amelioration of their cardiovascular fitness [43].",018b7865-c4aa-49d8-81d9-8788b729067a
38,methods25," Physical activity also proved to determine a beneficial effect in reducing chronic fatigue in patients treated for cHL [42,44]. We did not find any data on the correlations among physical activity and other clinical outcomes, e.g., QoL and OS.  Concerning the population of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors, who are more advanced in age, no evaluation supporting improvements via correction of lifestyle on cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes or QoL was available. The major concern was that the analyses performed on diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors were often present in larger studies including several non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) histotypes, for which data were not assessed separately, thereby not permitting reliable conclusions for the specific histotype. This was the main limitation in the extraction of conclusive data for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).",5e0dc81f-4810-4e84-a66c-83106f1827ce
39,methods26," Furthermore, the autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) population was studied very little in this context, even if it could present numerous areas for clinical improvement [36].  Among other factors, a BMI > 25 seemed to be associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease in cHL survivors [30], even if data were not confirmed in a subsequent study [45]. Both studies correlated BMI > 25 with higher risks for the following: hypertension; diabetes mellitus and smoking during the 5 years preceding the diagnosis of coronary heart disease; and factors related to the oncologic therapy, especially a dose-dependent mediastinal irradiation [30,45]. Probably, risks due to oncologic therapies and other cardiovascular factors overcome the obesity factor in the onset of coronary heart disease in cHL survivors treated before the introduction of modern radiotherapic techniques.",ca43f49f-c6ef-4f63-86a6-529af490d55c
40,methods27," However, it is rational to recommend adequate control of bodyweight and if necessary a nutritional intervention, in agreement with the guidelines for survivors of solid tumors and for cardiovascular prevention [2,47,48,49].  Compared to solid tumors, well-designed studies aiming to evaluate the impact of the Mediterranean diet on late toxicities and secondary cancers in long-term cHL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors are lacking. In any case, general guidelines recommend adhesion to this alimentary regimen for all cancer survivors [2,23,47,48]. Even though from our systematic review no studies had as their topic the benefit of the Mediterranean diet, it is rational to advise a controlled and balanced diet, consistent with the Mediterranean diet, to lymphoma survivors. In this context, there are no evidence to suggest the use of nutritional supplements for the prevention of the defined outcomes in this selected population.",86b7190e-1f35-43a2-98a0-5f581b6cf832
41,methods28," During counseling, it would be also important to discuss the abolition of smoking, e.g., suggesting participation in cessation programs, along with the correction of other common cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, etc.), in collaboration with cardiologists.  After the analyses on healthy lifestyles, Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) researchers proposed to evaluate whether there is a rationale for the use of survivorship care plans (SCP) among the population of cHL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors for ameliorating the diagnosis of late toxicities, adhering to screening programs for secondary cancers and correcting unhealthy lifestyles. survivorship care plans (SCP) are a valid and recapitulatory instrument mainly used in patients healed from solid tumors [35]. Their use could lead to a beneficial role also in lymphoma survivors [15].",36a4f114-21b9-4c23-bc3b-864c59a1015f
42,methods29," Some models of survivorship care plans (SCP) for lymphoma survivors are available online on the principal oncologic scientific society websites [50] and a nationwide program is ongoing for cHL survivors in the Netherlands [37]. Regarding patient empowerment through healthy lifestyles through the use of survivorship care plans (SCP), there is still little evidence in the literature. A study by Gates et al. showed that the application of survivorship care plans (SCP) via a nurse-led program increased the levels of physical activity among cHL survivors [46]. As previously discussed, precisely this factor led to an amelioration of the cardiovascular toxicity and then of comorbidities. According to the literature, data supporting the benefit of the use of survivorship care plans (SCP) in lymphoma survivors are still insufficient and there is a need for future evaluations.  5.",022c3b6e-2d21-45aa-abc4-8ce7f1b1c1be
43,methods30," Conclusions  In conclusion, the theme of lifestyles in lymphoma survivors is still immature, both in the field of clinical research and in daily practice. Given the clinical benefits of physical activity for cHL survivors, it is desirable to implement programs promoting and educating patients on this topic. In parallel, the areas of development of clinical research are numerous. It would be interesting to investigate modifiable lifestyle factors potentially impacting the prognosis, comorbidities and QoL of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors. Furthermore, a specific topic is survivors after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT), for whom clinical research could provide new information about long-term toxicities. For this purpose, tailored survivorship care plans (SCP) according to risk categories could represent the optimal tool. Our analyses focused on patients in remission for more than 5 years.",8d6b3612-67aa-4e58-8fce-b891c8d823fd
44,methods31," A population similarly significant is represented by patients in remission from 1 to 5 years, a period in which the correction of lifestyles could be more impactful and long-lasting. In this setting, the efficacy of lifestyle correction for cHL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors would be a promising topic for future research programs.
