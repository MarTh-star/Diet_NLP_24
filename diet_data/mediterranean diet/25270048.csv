0,introduction0,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) is the most common cause of abnormal liver biochemistry worldwide. Its prevalence is increasing in Asia [1–3]. The worldwide prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in general population is estimated to be 20 to 30% in Western countries and 5 to 18% in Asia [3]. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may progress to a wide range of liver abnormalities, ranging from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)), cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. It is also considered as the leading etiology for cryptogenic cirrhosis [4,5]. Substantial evidence supports that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), obesity and metabolic syndrome are strongly correlated, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an independent cardiovascular risk factor [6,7]. Therefore, determining risk factors for hepatic steatosis are important.",dd556405-0736-4b77-a88d-11d3c34b615c
1,introduction1,"  Diet may affect the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and dietary alterations have been suggested as a cornerstone for the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [8]. However, epidemiological data on the association between diet or nutrient composition and the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are limited. Previous studies on this aspect were mainly conducted in Caucasian populations. Most previous studies were limited by small sample size [9,10] and focused on high-risk population or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients [11–14]. Only few studies have included participants from a representative general population [15–17]. Moreover, the examination of diet as a risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has traditionally focused on the effect of single foods and nutrients, such as soft drinks and meat [16], fructose [18], choline [19] and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [17].",fe0ef76a-42e4-44f7-bbd9-f8ba06bf6c32
2,introduction2," Recently, a possible link between dietary acid-base load and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has also been suggested [20,21]. However, since diet is a combination of multiple exposures of food and nutrients, dietary pattern analysis is considered to be an alternative approach to investigate the association between diet and disease risk in epidemiological studies [22]. This approach involves the examination of the whole diet and considers the synergy of food and nutrient consumption, thus it may be more predictive of disease risk in comparison to individual foods or nutrients [22,23].  To our knowledge, only few observational studies [24–29] have been conducted to examine the association between dietary patterns and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adults and one prospective study has been done in a population-based cohort of adolescents [30].",8d805af3-9a3a-461a-9dda-d4ad36aad653
3,introduction3," In view of the scarcity of evidence on this topic and the fact that Chinese diets are different from Western diets, the present study aimed to examine the association of two diet-quality scores, namely the Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) and the Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence in 797 Chinese aged 18 years or above, using data from a population-based study in Hong Kong. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was selected because the Mediterranean diet has been widely reported for its many health benefits including its potential protective effect against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [31,32]. The traditional Chinese diet also shares several similarities with the Mediterranean diet, such that the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) can be applied to Chinese population [33].",675e42df-ba92-431a-9658-2da208a5a76f
4,introduction4," The DQI-I was chosen as it provides an effective means of cross-national comparative work for global understanding of diet quality, and has been used in epidemiological studies to quantify the diet quality in Chinese population [34,35]. We hypothesized that higher diet-quality score was associated with a reduced likelihood of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  The present analysis was different from the findings regarding the possible link between dietary acid-base load and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) of the same study population [20] in regard to the approach of analyzing dietary data. The present analysis used the dietary pattern approach in which the synergy of food and nutrient consumption was considered, while the previous analysis considered the association of a single nutritional factor, namely dietary acidity with the likelihood of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Otherwise, both analyses followed the same study protocol (S1 and S2 Files).  ",541fbb43-a1be-4659-96c6-b7df913c39c2
5,methods0,"Study population The study population were 797 subjects who aged 18 years or above and participated in a cross-sectional population screening study for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Details of the screening project have been reported previously [36,37] (S1 File) and can be found in the study protocol (S2 File). Those with active malignancy, metallic implants or other contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging, positive hepatitis B surface antigen or antibody against hepatitis C virus, treatment with steatogenic drugs (e.g. corticosteroids and estrogens), secondary causes of fatty liver (e.g. consumption of amiodarone and tamoxifen) and decompensated liver disease (defined as bilirubin above 50 μmol/l, albumin below 35 g/l, platelet count below 150 × 109/l, international normalized ratio above 1.3, or the presence of ascites or varices) (n = 147) were excluded [36,37].",57dcb268-087c-42c5-b9ef-eb36e7cf86b6
6,methods1," The present study also excluded those with excessive alcohol use (defined as more than 20 g/d day in men and more than 10 g/d in women) (n = 30) and those with incomplete dietary data (n = 95) from the final analysis. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong. All subjects provided informed written consent.  Clinical assessment At the baseline clinic visit, information of drug history, alcohol intake, smoking and past medical history were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements including body weight, body height, waist and hip circumferences were obtained using standardized methods. Blood tests for liver biochemistry, glucose and lipids were taken after at least 8 hours of fasting.",866051cb-3fbe-48be-a1c9-736866d71133
7,methods2," Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the ethnic-specific criteria by the International Diabetes Federation, which was modified from the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III Guidelines [38]. Details of the clinical assessment have been described previously [36].  Proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS)  1H-MRS was performed to measure intrahepatic triglyceride content (intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTG)) within 8 weeks from the baseline visit. Details of the scanning sequence and analysis have been described previously [36,39]. Whole-body 3.0T scanner with a single voxel point-resolved spectroscopy sequence and an echo time of 40 ms and repetition time of 5,000 ms was used. Fatty liver was defined as an intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTG) of 5% or more [40].  Genetic analysis Genomic DNA was extracted from 100 μl buffy coat using QIAamp Blood DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and QIAcube System (Qiagen, Germany).",d15f89ae-e667-4382-b086-4867a63f1406
8,methods3," Extracted DNA was quantified using Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). For each subject, 20 ng of genomic DNA was used for PNPLA3 rs738409 allelic discrimination using TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays (Life Technologies, USA) on the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, USA). Details have been described elsewhere [41].  Dietary assessment A locally validated food-frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) was used to capture food intake and dietary intake over 7 days [42]. The questionnaire contained 297 food items in seven broad categories: bread / pasta / rice; vegetables; fruit; meat / fish / egg; beverages; dimsum / snacks; soups; and oil / salt / sauces. Subjects were asked to complete the questionnaires under the supervision of a trained research staff, with food models, food containers, and a catalogue of pictures of individual food portions provided to facilitate portion size estimation.",f10abd70-8042-4848-8aa3-ffd17cbcdb8e
9,methods4," The amount of cooking oil was calculated based on the usual cooking methods, the usual type of cooking oil and the usual portion of different foods used by the subjects [43]. Daily nutrient intakes and food group intakes were estimated using Food Processor Nutrition analysis and Fitness software version 8.0 (ESHA Research, Salem, Oregon, USA) with the addition of local and Chinese food items [44–46]. All nutrient intakes were energy adjusted by the residual method for regression analysis [47]. Details of the dietary assessment have been described previously [20].  The Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was calculated using the revised method described by Trichopoulou et al. [48]. One score was assigned to consumption of the food groups considered beneficial to health at or above the sex-specific median (vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereal, fish and monosaturated to saturated lipids ratio).",1756938b-74ed-4b5d-8433-f46b3af7220a
10,methods5," Similarly, one score was also assigned to consumption of the food groups presumed to be detrimental to health (meat, poultry and dairy products) below the median. Because a substantial proportion of subjects did not consume alcohol, the component of ethanol consumption was excluded in the scoring. Therefore, total Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) ranged from 0 (minimal adherence) to 8 (maximal adherence) instead of 0 to 9.  Dietary Quality Index-International (DQI-I) The Dietary Quality index-International (DQI-I) was calculated according to the method described by Kim et al. [34]. Four major aspects of the diet are assessed in the DQI-I, namely variety, adequacy, moderation and overall balance. The score ranges from 0 to 100 and higher score represents better diet quality. In this study, we did not have enough information to calculate the category of empty-calorie foods under the aspect ‘moderation’.",492d8ce5-e63a-44a7-8642-5f75c57e4ed3
11,methods6," Therefore the range of score for moderation was 0 to 24 instead of 0 to 30 as originally proposed in the calculation, and the DQI-I total score was 0 to 94 instead of 0 to 100. Details of the DQI-I calculation have been described elsewhere [49]. ",ed599b0c-53fd-4b04-9d86-b05006287764
12,analysis0,"Statistical tests were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, US). Histograms were used to screen for normal distribution. Logarithmic transformation was applied to skewed variables whenever appropriate. Continuous variables were expressed in mean ± SD and compared using the independent t test if they were normally distributed. Skewed variables were expressed in median (in median (IQR)) and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were compared using chi-squared test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium of alleles was assessed by chi-squared test. Pearson’s correlation or Spearman’s rank correlation was used to examine the correlation between each diet-quality score and food group or nutrient intakes whenever appropriate.",826b38bc-7d21-4de1-8971-8337928b4805
13,analysis1,"  The association between each diet-quality score and intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTG) and the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was analyzed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression models, respectively. The first model was adjusted for sex and age (continuous). The second model was further adjusted for BMI (continuous), daily energy intake (continuous), current smoker status (yes/no), current drinker status (yes/no), the five individual metabolic components including central obesity (yes/no), triglyceride >1.7 mmol/l (yes/no), reduced HDLC (yes/no), hypertension (yes/no), and impaired fasting glucose or diabetes (yes/no), and the PNPLA3 genotypes. We also examined whether the association between each diet-quality score and the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varied according to sex, BMI, age, current drinker status, the presence of metabolic syndrome, or the PNPLA3 genotypes.",c00e92ba-54a2-47e0-abd6-b015570d1570
14,analysis2," All models were additionally stratified by sex (men and women), age (<50 vs. > = 50 years), BMI (normal weight group <23 vs. overweight and obese group > = 23 kg/m2), current drinker status (yes vs. no), the presence of metabolic syndrome (yes vs. no), and the PNPLA3 genotypes (CC vs. CG vs. GG genotypes). We also investigated potential effect modifications by sex, age, BMI, current drinker status, the presence of metabolic syndrome and the PNPLA3 genotypes by inclusion of cross-product terms to the regression models. No significant interactions were detected for all these stratified variables, thus data were presented based on the results of the whole sample. The above multivariate logistic regression models were repeated to explore the association between each energy adjusted nutrient intake variable or food group intake variable and the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",fc7e1913-e243-42fa-a94c-04aefb7a7a05
15,analysis3," Due to the skewness in the distribution for most food group intake variables, the food group intake variables were categorized into tertiles based on the distribution of the entire sample. Odds ratios (OR) were computed to compare the middle and upper tertile groups with the lower tertile group. Test for trend was examined by entering tertiles of food group intake as a fixed factor and testing the contrast by using the polynomial option in all models. All tests were 2-sided and P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. ",a0f4906f-1019-4169-a906-ee537ea2ba3e

To our knowledge, only few observational studies [24–29] have been conducted to examine the association between dietary patterns and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adults and one prospective study has been done in a population-based cohort of adolescents [30].

A recent cross-sectional, population based study, however, showed that a dietary pattern, characterized by increased intake of alcohol and meat (poultry), and reduced consumption of tea, was associated with higher liver fat content in adults [29]. Only one observational study has previously investigated exploratory dietary patterns and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk, which was limited to adolescents [30].",04e73077-dab4-4aa9-9688-d547fdaa1c46

Different study design, choices and assessment methods of outcome measures, covariates and confounding factors included in the statistical analysis, as well as methods to generate dietary quality indices or dietary pattern scores in various studies might lead to the mixed findings.  Previous studies have related DQI-I or Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with cardiovascular risk, obesity and metabolic outcomes, and generally support that better diet quality is associated with better cardiovascular or metabolic outcomes [50,51]. To our knowledge, our study is the first study to report a positive association between DQI-I and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence.",d20138ae-5da8-4f09-94d6-ef0fb4a30c09

These intake levels are in line with the recommended intake of at least 400 g/day of vegetables and fruits by the World Health Organization for the prevention of diet-related chronic diseases [52]. Contrary to our findings that no association was observed between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence, several observational studies and clinical trials have preliminarily suggested that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet might protect against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [31,32].",7925cfbb-2cbe-47a1-bc88-0fdfbeba5f5d
29,discussion4," Although the Chinese diet has many similar features with the Mediterranean diet, in that vegetable and fruit consumption is high, and fat and meat consumption is low, the consumption of legumes, milk and milk products, nuts, olive oil and wine was less in our cohort than the traditional Mediterranean diet. These differences may be one of the reasons to explain the absence of association between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence. Moreover, the various scores differ in many aspects of both indices, such as the items included, the cut-off values used, and the exact method of scoring may be some reasons to explain the different results of DQI-I and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in the present study.",e46a108b-993f-4f1e-9418-27c51e428f66
30,discussion5," For example, the scores of various components of the DQI-I are based on recommended reference intake that are beneficial for health, whereas the cut-off value of each component in the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) is based on the group median intake of each component. The latter scoring system may lead to bias because the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) calculation is based on cohort- and sex-specific median values across eight food categories of the studied sample, and it may not be related to a healthy level of intake per se [53].  Our data showed that the association between both diet-quality scores and the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was in general stronger in male than in female, and in overweight or obese subjects than in normal weight subjects.

31,discussion6,", in which no significant interaction with age, sex, BMI, or type 2 diabetes status was detected between dietary pattern scores and liver fat measured using magnetic resonance imaging as liver signal intensity [29]. The gender- and BMI-specific differences in the association between diet-quality scores and the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in our study could be largely explained by the differences in metabolic factors. Our data also suggested that the association between both diet-quality scores and the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was not affected by the PNPLA3 genotypes. Previous studies focusing on the interaction between the PNPLA3 genotypes and single nutrient intake, such as dietary sugar and essential omega polyunsaturated fatty acids showed that the association of these nutrients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) might be driven by a predisposing GG genotype [54,55].",fbd789c7-04dd-4480-acb9-61ee5bca88ff
