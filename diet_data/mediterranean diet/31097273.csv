Supelco™ 37 component fatty acid methyl esters (fatty acid methyl esters (FAME)) mix, containing the methyl esters of 37 fatty acids was supplied by Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA).  4.2. Sample Collection Procedure For this study, BLUD (Banca del Latte Umano Donato, Struttura Complessa di Neonatologia e Terapia Intensiva Neonatale—Azienda Ospedaliera Santa Maria della Misericordia—Perugia, Italy) provided human milk samples from thirty healthy donors. All mothers who had pathologies, such as hypo- or hyperthyroidism, diabetes, adrenal diseases, autoimmune diseases and alteration of the lipid profile in the blood were excluded. The project was approved by the Bioethics Committee of Perugia University (number 2018-05) and all procedures were performed accordingly. All donors signed informed consent.",d31e0f96-8eef-473e-a45f-71e54c32ea05
1,methods1," The milk samples were collected between March 1, 2019 and September 30, 2019 by using standardized procedures. Immediately after collecting, milk samples were submitted to Holder pasteurization that aims to rid milk of potentially harmful germs by heating it to 62.5 °C (145 °F) for half an hour, and then cooling it back down to 4–10 °C, a method used the world over to help ensure that the milk distributed by human milk banks is safe for infants to consume. Samples were then stored in a −20 °C freezer before analysis in order to know exactly the characteristics of the milk used to feed the infants.  4.3.",07bc2d0b-aee6-4a2d-af14-7ce00ab2c401
2,methods2," Mothers Interview A specific interview was carried out with the mothers to find out: (a) the state of health of the pregnant and lactating subject; (b) the consumption of drugs, alcohol, smoking during pregnancy and during breastfeeding; (c) the anthropometric measures pre- and post-pregnancy; (d) physical activity carried out before and after pregnancy; (e) gestational time and weight of the newborn; (f) nutritional habits of the subject during pregnancy e during breastfeeding. Regarding the diet followed, the interview aimed to have information on how many mothers followed a Mediterranean diet (MD), how many had eaten mainly vegetables and fruit (VF), how many had eaten mainly meat and fish (MF) and, finally, how many had eaten mainly meat and cereals (MC).  4.4. Lipid Extraction and Gas Chromatographic Analysis of Fatty Acids Milk lipid fraction was extracted using a chloroform–methanol mixture (2:1, v/v), following the procedure previously reported [39].",3fd19bf2-c82f-4031-9793-c8d4896287fd
3,methods3," The fatty acid methyl esters (fatty acid methyl esters (FAME)) of total lipids were prepared by transmethylation with methanolic KOH and analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography. A DANI 1000DPC gas-chromatograph (Norwalk, CT, USA), equipped with a split–splitless injector and a flame ionization detector, was used. fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) separation was performed with a CP-Select CB for fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) fused silica capillary column (50 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm f.t.; Varian, Superchrom, Milan, Italy). The injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C. The oven temperature was 60 °C, held for 5 min then raised to 225 °C at 3 °C/min; the final temperature was held for 10 min. The chromatograms were acquired and processed using Clarity integration software (DataApex, Ltd., Prague, Czech Republic).  A standard solution containing 37 fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) was used to identify the individual fatty acids.",bfb85e93-3d4c-4c5d-b11f-a5a828c01437
4,methods4," The percentage of each FA was calculated using the peak area corrected with the respective correction factors [39]. HRGC analysis was carried out in triplicate.  4.5. Antioxidant Assay by Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC)) The antioxidant capacity of umbrian LBB extract was determined using the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) method as previously reported [40]. We have chosen Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) method because it is a robust and reliable method. In fact, the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay, other common measures of antioxidant capacity include ferric ion reducing antioxidant power and trolox equivalence antioxidant capacity assays and therefore is considered to be a preferable method because of its biologic relevance [41].",e2d90a15-f5af-456b-8c6f-b940ea7fbd7a
5,methods5," A duplicate extraction was performed for each sample and used to evaluate the lipophilic (L-Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC)FL) and hydrophilic Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC)FL (H-Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC)FL) values. Evaluations of the lipophilic and hydrophilic Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC)FL in the LBBs samples were performed separately, and the total antioxidant capacity (total antioxidant capacity (TAC)) was calculated by adding the L-Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC)FL and H-Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC)FL values. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC)FL assays were carried out on a FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate fluorescence reader (BMG LABTECH, Offenburg, Germany) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. The procedure was based on the method of Zulueta et al. (2009) with slight modifications.",fb695626-0d51-4b45-841c-c11aeacd9a92
6,methods6," Briefly, 2,20-azobis (2-methylpropionamide) dihydrochloride (AAPH) was used as a peroxyl radical generator, trolox was used as a reference antioxidant standard, and fluorescein was used as a fluorescent probe. The data are expressed as micromoles of trolox equivalents (TE) per gram of sample (μmol TE/g).  4.6. Statistical Analysis We first consider suitable samples of data concerning the concentration of different acids of milk samples, and successively the corresponding samples of data concerning the antioxidant potential. We used MD samples consisting of that data on a suitable number of patients, which better express the goodness of our experimental results. We compute the related mean and standard deviation by using Excel. Successively, we consider three other samples, VF, MF and MC, respectively, which contain the corresponding data about other smaller groups of patients. We compute again the mean and the standard deviation of each sample.",b11f0b46-843f-4340-96fd-0b02b8ced9fb
7,methods7," Moreover, we called 1PT, 2PT, 3PT, 4PT and 5PT samples of preterm formulas from 5 different companies and 1T, 2T, 3T, 4T, and 5T samples of term formulas from other 5 different companies, we also get the mean and the standard deviation. We compare with the MD samples other Human breast milk (HBM) samples obtained by our experimental results. Moreover, MD samples were divided into preterm Human breast milk (HBM) (PT) and term Human breast milk (HBM) (T) samples and T samples were analyzed against PT. PT and T infant formulas were analyzed against MD PT and T Human breast milk (HBM), respectively. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the total world population of nursing mothers has a “normal” distribution, and that the chosen samples are pairwise independent. Since the number of patients of each sample is less than 30 and, in general, the variances of the samples are not equal, we deal with Welch’s t-test [42].",f6645829-1502-4852-bdb4-2774e7873f21
8,methods8," When we compare two samples S1 and S2, this test defines the statistic t by means of the formula where ni is the size, yi¯ is the mean and Si is the standard deviation of Si, i=1,2 and in general S1≠S2.  (1) t=y1¯−y2¯S12n1 ± S22n2 ,   We will test the null hypothesis μ1=μ2 (H0) versus the alternative hypothesis μ1≠μ2 (H1), where μ1 and μ2 are the means corresponding to the world nursing mothers populations in connection with the considered milk antioxidant powers or acid concentrations, related to S1 and S2, respectively. The studied test statistic is: (2) T=y1¯−y2¯−(μ1−μ2)S12n1 ± S22n2 .",37d5e5a1-4d0d-4c65-bf36-3124d4e8da25
9,methods9,"   In considering artificial milks, when the mean and the variance of the corresponding S2 are given, it is not necessary to know all elements of S2, because n2=3: indeed, by the definition of mean and sample standard deviation, y2¯ and S2 are equal to the mean and the standard deviation, respectively, of the sample T2={y2¯−S2,y2¯,y2¯ ± S2}, Thus, in this case, without restriction, in our calculations we “replace” S2 with T2.  The Excel functions T.TEST and TEST.T compute directly the p-value related to T, that is the quantity  (3) 2⋅min {Pr({T≤t|H0}), Pr({T≥t|H0})},  where the symbols in (3) denote the probability that the test statistic T is less (resp. greater) than or equal to t, when the null hypothesis H0 is true since we deal with a two-tail hypothesis test. The p-value is the smallest significance level at which the obtained data lead to reject the null hypothesis. As we consider the significance levels α1=0.05, α2=0.01 or α3=0.",1b1ad24d-bba0-4add-b941-84676966d4e7
10,methods10,"001, the null hypothesis will be rejected if and only if the p-value is less than or equal to α1 (or α2 or α3). Thus, a p-value p≤α1 (or p≤α2 or p≤α3) indicates that the sample S2 is significant (resp. highly significant, strongly significant) with respect to S1 or equivalently that S1 is significant (resp. highly significant, strongly significant) with respect to S2.  When we compare our “white” sample S1 with the corresponding sample S2 related with an artificial milk, if we have the mean, but not the variance of S2, we consider the statistic t˜ defined by  (4) t˜=(y1¯−y2¯) n1S1 ,  where n1 and S1 are the size and the standard deviation of S1, respectively and yi¯ is the mean of Si, i=1,2. The associated test statistic is  (5) T˜=(y1¯−μ2) n1S1 ,  where y1¯, n1, S1 and μ2 have the same meaning as above. We will test the null hypothesis μ1=μ2 versus the alternative hypothesis μ1≠μ2. The variable T˜ is a “Student-type” t random variable with n1−1 degrees of freedom.",c83a02ff-4141-4a61-b21e-1608dd803c66
11,methods11," The Excel functions TDIST and DISTRIB.T compute the related p-value. Note that in this case, if we do the hypothesis that S2 has null variance, then considering t (resp. T) is equivalent to dealing with t˜ (resp. T˜) and the involved statistic is independent of the size of S2.  Now, let S0 be the first “white sample” on the antioxidant power of the considered milks and let n, X¯, S denote its size, mean and standard deviation, respectively. We compute a 95, a 99 and a 99.9 percent confidence interval estimator for the mean μ of the total world population of nursing mothers. Since the variance σ2 of this population is unknown and the size of S0 is less than 30, it is advisable to replace σ2 with its estimator S2, and to deal with the random variable  (6) Tn−1=(X¯−μ) nS ,  which is a “Student-type” t random variable with n−1 degrees of freedom. Let us consider the probability density fn−1 associated with Tn−1 and let tn−1,αi be the real number such that Pr({Tn−1>tn−1,αi})=αi, i=1,2,3.",c9243a59-8c63-4e9a-8cf9-54789c85222c
12,methods12," Since the graph of fn−1 is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, we get  (7) 1−αi=Pr({|Tn−1|≤tn−1,αi/2})=Pr({|X¯−μ| nS≤tn−1,αi/2})=Pr({X¯−tn−1,αi/2 Sn≤μ≤X¯ ± tn−1,αi/2 Sn}).   Thus, a 100(1−αi) percent confidence interval estimator for the mean μ of the considered population is given by  (8) X¯ ± tn−1,αi/2 Sn ,  that is [43].  (9) [X¯−tn−1,αi/2 Sn, X¯ ± tn−1,αi/2 Sn]   The computation of this interval is done by using Excel again. When we compare two samples S1, S2 and we get only the size, the mean and the standard deviation of the samples without having the complete data, like for instance in the case of the acids X, Y, Z, etc., it is not possible to use directly the Excel functions T.TEST or TEST.T. Therefore, in Welch’s test, we first compute the number of the degrees of freedom ν by means of the formula (formula 26) [41] and then we round ν to the nearest integer. The Excel functions TDIST and DISTRIB.T compute the corresponding p-value.",81624a7d-6554-4be1-afa9-5bcf388770a9
