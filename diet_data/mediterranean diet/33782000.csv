0,background0," Depression is a prevalent condition that has a significant impact on psychosocial functioning and quality of life. The onset and persistence of depression have been linked to a variety of biological and psychosocial variables. Many of these variables are associated with specific lifestyle characteristics, such as physical activity, diet, and sleep patterns. Some psychosocial determinants have an impact on people’ health-related behavior change. These include personal factors such as sense of coherence, patient activation, health literacy, self-efficacy, and procrastination. This study aims to analyze the association between the severity of depression, lifestyle patterns, and personal factors related to health behavior. It also aims to analyze whether personal factors moderate the relationship between lifestyles and depression. ",750db65d-ef30-4402-ba79-73d7a1a26b07
1,methods0," This study is a secondary data analysis (secondary data analysis (SDA)) of baseline data collected at the start of a randomized controlled trial (randomized controlled trial (RCT)). A sample of 226 patients with subclinical, mild, or moderate depression from primary healthcare centers in two sites in Spain (Zaragoza and Mallorca) was used, and descriptive, bivariate, multivariate, and moderation analyses were performed. Depression was the primary outcome, measured by Beck II Self-Applied Depression Inventory. Lifestyle variables such as physical exercise, adherence to Mediterranean diet and sleep quality, social support, and personal factors such as self-efficacy, patient activation in their own health, sense of coherence, health literacy, and procrastination were considered secondary outcomes.

Moderation Analysis  Regression coefficients were obtained for the variables that showed significant results in the bivariate analysis. In each model, one of the significant lifestyle variables (PSQI or international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ)-SF-Sedentarism) and one of the significant personal factors (SES, Patient Activation Questionnaire (PAM), sense of coherence (SOC)-13, HLS-EUQ16, or irrational procrastination scale (IPS)) were included. Next, as all the models were significant, the interaction term between them was created and added to the regression model. At this point, only the interaction between SES and PSQI was significant, so that was the only moderation worth exploring.",c6926a9d-eb51-4a2b-a7c6-be141c686ed4
4,results6," So, to test whether SES moderates the relationship between PSQI and depression (BDI-II), hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted. In the first step, two variables were included as: SES and PSQI. These two variables accounted for a significant amount of depression, R2 = 0.226, F(2, 223) = 32.517, p < 0.001. The interaction term between them was added to the regression model which accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in BDI-II, ΔR2 = 0.014, ΔF(1, 222) = 4.07, p < 0.001. However, the effect only showed a tendency b = 0.0026, t(222) = 1.942, p = 0.053 (Table 3). As this moderation was not significant, the interaction plot was not examined to establish the direction of the relationship.

6,discussion0," This study aimed to analyze the association between the severity of the depression, lifestyle patterns (physical exercise, sleep, and diet), and personal factors related to health behavior (self-efficacy, activation in their own health, sense of coherence, health literacy, and procrastination).  Regarding the multivariate analysis, data showed that having a low sense of coherence, poor sleep quality, low patient activation, and sedentarism were predictors of having higher depressive symptomatology. Findings as such add to the body of evidence that some lifestyles and personal factors are related to depression. In line with our results, it has been widely shown that sense of coherence is inversely related to depression, presenting a protective capacity against depressive symptoms (Plata-Muñoz et al., 2004; Skärsäter et al., 2009; Anyfantakis et al., 2015; López-Martínez et al., 2019).",b41760e1-d89c-4609-8c92-4b87f47330c3
7,discussion1," In line with other studies, patient activation in their own health is associated with better mental health  and is negatively correlated with depression . Depressive symptoms are typically accompanied by emotions of helplessness and poor quality of life, which are then related to low patient activation scores . A sedentary lifestyle is recognized as a risk factor for depression (Porras-Segovia et al., 2019) since sedentary people tend to dedicate less time to physical exercise or social activities . Sleep quality has also been shown to have significant weight in explaining depression. Sleep has been linked to depression in multiple studies since a lack of sleep is one of the most frequent symptoms that appear in depression .",e9a75d57-b6c5-49ac-8889-cb1a9615e551
8,discussion2,"  The bivariate analysis revealed that individuals with more depressive symptoms had lower age, and a lower score in social support, self-efficacy, patient activation in their own health, sense of coherence, and lower levels of health literacy. In addition, depressive symptoms were related to a more sedentary lifestyle, poor sleep quality, and more procrastination. However, no significant relationship was found with regard to the adherence to a Mediterranean diet, nor with the minutes of walking per week. Regarding adherence to a Mediterranean diet, this non-significant association could be due to the fact that the mean score obtained in our sample was 6.38. In some studies, to consider that there is optimal adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern, the result needed to be greater than 9 (Salvatore-Benito et al., 2019; Gregório et al., 2020).",040ab5ca-c8a6-41ad-89f9-37b851c37004
9,discussion3," This low score has been found in several studies that show how Spain and other Mediterranean-based countries are moving away from Mediterranean diet patterns (Godoy-Izquierdo et al., 2021). Regarding minutes spent walking per week, this non-significant association could be due to the fact that the mean of minutes spent walking per week in our sample was 212.32, which is more or less the amount recommended (150 min per week of moderate aerobic physical activity or a minimum of 75 min per week of vigorous aerobic activity; World Health Organization, 2010). Our sample had an adequate amount (in minutes) of physical exercise, but the predominant physical activity was walking, which is the one with the lowest intensity. Therefore, although all physical exercise provides health benefits, the frequency, intensity, and duration of the exercise have a significant influence on its benefits (World Health Organization, 2010).",df5c8858-1edc-498f-a6fb-80e5819a5e81
10,discussion4," This relationship requires further research as the questionnaire used (international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ)-SF) has inherent shortcomings (i.e., individuals may have had conceptual difficulty distinguishing between terms such as vigorous or moderate physical activity; people may have had certain limits recalling weekly activities; and there may have been overestimations regarding the amount of physical activity done. In any case, international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ)-SF reliability and validity have been rigorously verified in many countries, and it is widely used in current international research ).  Furthermore, this study also aimed to analyze whether personal factors moderate the relationship between lifestyles and depression. These moderation analyses were not significant.",0ad022f3-75e2-46d9-bd75-60b50b759de3
11,discussion5," This means that in the present sample, the relationship between the lifestyles tested (sleep quality and sedentarism) and depression does not change according to the value of the different moderators (i.e., personal factors). The interrelationship between lifestyles, personal factors, and depression should be studied further, for example, in larger sample sizes where there may be more power to detect moderation effects, by testing other types of analysis such as mediation, and/or using longitudinal data.  The present secondary data analysis (SDA) study provides data for gaining knowledge and understanding into the relationships between lifestyle, personal factors, and depression. Given the results that some lifestyle and personal factors are related to depression, some programs that modify lifestyle and personal factors might be beneficial in reducing symptoms of depression.",6ea5b97a-1da8-4894-97aa-b5412abf1569
12,discussion6," This would be in line with recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trial (RCT)s of Lifestyle Modification Programs (LMPs) suggesting that LMPs might be effective in mitigating depressive symptoms (Gómez-Gómez et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2021).  Strengths  This type of research, in which various topics about healthy lifestyles and personal factors are analyzed together in their association with depression (sleep quality, physical exercise, adherence to a Mediterranean diet, self-efficacy, patient activation in their own health, sense of coherence, health literacy, and procrastination), is scarce. This study adds to the body of evidence that some lifestyles and personal factors are related to depression.",61dc92b9-3b14-47e6-b395-9cdd0bab1256
13,discussion7," In addition, the profile of the participants corresponded with the profile of those who generally attend PHCs consultations, as the majority of patients have depression, and this type of patient is usually treated in PHCs, with only a small percentage of them being referred to a specialist.  Limitations  Even though secondary data analysis (SDA)s complement primary data collection, could be a suitable starting point for some research, and are a cost-effective way of describing the current situation (McCaston, 2005), they have some limitations. For example, we are not able to make causal inferences (Wickham, 2019), and the associations identified might be difficult to interpret (Wang and Cheng, 2020). Because this is an exploratory secondary data analysis (SDA) of an randomized controlled trial (RCT), there were no sample size estimates or p-value adjustments.",ecec54c6-0ed2-4ad4-beb2-d10f66df21d9
14,discussion8," So, the findings must be interpreted with caution and should only be regarded as preliminary signs that should be studied further.  Conclusion  Depression is a common pathology worldwide. Lifestyle and personal factors are related to depressive symptomatology. Our findings reveal that sense of coherence, the patient’s activation level, sedentarism, and sleep quality are associated with depression. Further research is needed regarding adherence to Mediterranean diet, minutes walking per week and the interrelationship between lifestyles, personal factors, and depression.
