0,introduction0,"Nutrition and dietary habits are recognized factors in the development, progression and prevention of chronic pathologies such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases.1,2 However, the impact of diet on lung function and respiratory diseases is not as well established.3  Tobacco smoke is the most important factor in the etiopathogenesis of respiratory pathology, although other factors may also be involved, such as environmental agents, respiratory infections, genetic and epigenetic disorders, and dietary habits.4 Inhalation of tobacco smoke particles accelerates the physiological decline of lung volume attributable to aging and increases susceptibility to respiratory dysfunction.5 Smoking generates thousands of free radical particles, an important source of inflammation and oxidative stress, which can be neutralized by dietary intake of antioxidants or/an anti-inflammatory leading to a protective effect on lung function.",f8d994f1-22d6-46e9-a4ac-1a9fc1e41148
1,introduction1,"6 Specifically, the protective action of certain nutrients and food on respiratory function parameters, such as forced vital capacity (forced vital capacity (FVC)) and expiratory flow in the first second (FEV1), has been reported.7 Thus, consumption of fruits and vegetables with a high content of antioxidant vitamins, phenolic compounds, minerals and dietary fibre has a beneficial effect on respiratory health.8,9 Regarding the role of vitamins (vitamins C, D, E, A, beta and alpha carotene), they have been associated with improvement in features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) such as symptoms and exacerbations, and high intake would probably reduce the annual decline of pulmonary function.10 Omega-3 fatty acids present in fat fish and shellfish have an anti-inflammatory effect involved in the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",540b48af-a679-4240-a7fd-aeb11ba34888
2,introduction2,"11 In contrast, high consumption of processed meat has been associated with worse pulmonary function and increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).12,13 Also, low or moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with better lung function, while excessive intake has detrimental effects.14,15 Although the evaluation of the effect of individual foods has been valuable, it presents conceptual and methodological limitations because the diet contains a variety of foods that may interact with one another, thus varying the effects of single foods.16 Therefore, analysis of dietary patterns is now considered to offer a better approximation to the study of the effects of food on health.",ed841b63-2717-4aa6-8697-ff7321fac817
3,introduction3," Available evidence shows that the “western-unhealthy” diet with high consumption of fried and processed foods, processed meats, refined sugars and sweets increases the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),17,18 whereas a “prudent-healthy” diet rich in whole grains, vegetables, fruits and fish is associated with better lung function.19  The traditional dietary pattern of Mediterranean (MD, Mediterranian diet) countries includes a set of characteristic foods with beneficial effects against inflammation and oxidation, such as fat fish, vegetables, legumes and fresh fruits, nuts and olive oil.20 The MD is rich in antioxidants (vitamins C and E, beta-carotene and folates), phenolic compounds (the most abundant being flavonoids), and mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids.21 The effectiveness of the MD intervention for cardiovascular risk reduction in adults is well established, and for years has been recommended in cardiovascular prevention.",986d2942-380a-4d2f-be1f-a14a1e807435
4,introduction4,"1 Other studies have expanded the MD benefits to other diseases such as endocrine-metabolic, neurodegenerative and certain types of cancer.22 Extending this recommendation to respiratory pathology related to smoking is of evident interest in primary prevention.  The present study is part of a broader program to reduce smoking behaviours: the RESET-DIET project, a clinical trial on smoking cessation, designed to evaluate the efficacy of a motivational intervention based on information obtained from spirometry.23 In this project, our group carried out a pioneering observational study to identify dietary patterns present in an adult smoker population, and examine their association with lung function.",00621b6e-3f07-471b-a928-6f0ed7c3c23b
5,introduction5,"24 We identified three major patterns: a mixed intake pattern with alcohol consumption (wine, beer and distillates), a westernized-style pattern (red and processed meat, dairy products and sugary drinks) and a Mediterranean-like pattern (poultry, eggs, fish, vegetables, legumes, potatoes, fruit and nuts). Multivariate analysis associated a higher probability of lung functional impairment with the mixed-alcohol pattern in both men and women (OR 4.56, 95% CI 1.58–13.18) and with the westernized-style pattern only in women (OR 5.62, 95% CI 1.17–27.02), compared to the Mediterranean-like pattern (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.28–1.79).24 In contrast, a smaller sample power caused very wide intervals in the statistical tests (especially OR) and was not sufficient to achieve a significance inverse association (trend only) in this “prudent” pattern.",2931351d-1dd6-4e2e-9268-ffad2edfd105
6,introduction6,"  Altogether, the findings suggest that certain personal conditions (such as anthropometric characteristics) and dietary patterns in the smoking population are associated with impaired lung function, and offers new perspectives on avoiding the preventable loss of lung function through adherence to a healthy diet pattern.24–27 To our knowledge, no national or international groups are currently working on the protective effects of MD in preventing respiratory diseases. Therefore, our research purpose is to evaluate the effect of MD adherence on lung function in smokers without previous respiratory disease. ",e7ce4900-be9f-48b6-811b-46929fa3dfe1

Each question scores 0 or 1, consequently, total score ranges from 0 to 14. The higher the score, the greater the degree of adherence to MD pattern.

Therefore, in order to standardize the intervention, the dieticians who collaborate in the MEDISTAR study and who design the intervention and develop the educational content and materials will provide thorough training in MD and pulmonary function at the beginning of the study for all participating health-care professionals.  The effect on lung function will be assessed by comparing the results of several forced spirometry tests, taken during the project follow-up period, between intervention and control groups. Although this should be sufficient time to observe some effect of the diet on spirometry values, it may be too short to show statistically and clinically significant differences between the two study groups.",8af19c5b-3500-4fc3-a118-b119ef1501a7

A common limitation of long-term projects is the loss of participants during the follow-up. To minimize losses, a multi-component intervention incorporating communication technology has been planned. In this sense, the use of a nutritional blog is intended to facilitate interaction between the intervention group participants and the researchers, beyond the scope of the office visit, and should favour adherence during the study period. Moreover, annual telephone contacts should help to consolidate the intervention and maintain direct personal contact with all participants in both study groups.

There is no exclusive prudent diet identified as healthiest for respiratory health. The MD is a diet rich in food with healthy fats and natural antioxidants, and could be a role model for its positive effects on lung function.",1ce04445-2078-43b6-a57d-d7c02c8d2d15

If the results confirm our hypothesis that an increased MD adherence may prevent the deterioration of lung function in smokers, it could have a great potential for preventive recommendation in general population, as part of a healthier lifestyle, especially in smokers who cannot quit smoking.
