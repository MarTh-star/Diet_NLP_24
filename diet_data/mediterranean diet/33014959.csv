The animal studies were performed in accordance with ethical regulations and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China.  To evaluate and compare the effects of different dietary patterns objectively, dietary habits from childhood to youth were simulated. Subsequently, dietary interventions were started from the age of 4 weeks. As the mice in the high-sugar diet and high-salt diet groups may have difficulty controlling the amount of food due to preference problem, each mouse was administered intragastrically with 200 μL of a different dose solution each day. high-sugar diet was intragastrically administered with 5500 mg (kg·d)−1 sucrose [12], and high-salt diet was intragastrically administered with 5250 mg (kg·d)−1 NaCl [13,14].",5e1fd858-8044-4d0a-ab8b-4310e1b15713

11,methods11," According to HE-staining results in Figure 3B, the pulmonary alveoli were destructed, and inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in the negative control group 1 and negative control group 2 mice lung tissues. Compared to that of the negative control group 2, the Mediterranean diet, diet restriction, low-protein diet, ketogenic diet, and low-fat diet treatments improved the pulmonary alveoli tissue morphology and suppressed lung metastasis. Compared to that of the negative control group 1, the high-sugar diet and high-salt diet treatments exacerbated lung tissue damage and metastasis.  3.3. Effects of Different Dietary Patterns on circulating tumor cell (CTC)s  Previous research by our group explored the effective capture of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s on mouse tumor models with functional indwelling needles [9].",0f2526d6-e7af-4e5c-85df-35e5f88d7e89
12,methods12," This method can capture circulating tumor cell (CTC) in the blood on the seventh day after tumor inoculation, which can detect the occurrence of tumor metastasis in early cancer. In this study, the effects of different dietary patterns on breast cancer metastasis were evaluated by detecting circulating tumor cell (CTC) numbers at different time points during breast cancer metastasis and according to the trend of the number of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s (Figure 4). According to the results of in vivo capture of circulating tumor cell (CTC) in a mouse 4T1-xenograft model, circulating tumor cell (CTC)s can be captured on the seventh day after vaccination. As shown in Figure 5A, the change in the number of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s was closely related to cancer metastasis, and circulating tumor cell (CTC) numbers showed an upward trend with the extension of the duration of cancer.",4ad167c9-0bb9-4db5-9585-6ab396eb369e
13,methods13," The number of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s in the five dietary patterns including low-fat diet, ketogenic diet, low-protein diet, diet restriction, and Mediterranean diet was lower than that of negative control group 2 (p < 0.05), among which the Mediterranean diet and diet restriction groups exhibited stronger anti-metastasis effect (p < 0.01), and showed more effective anti-metastasis effect than that of the positive control group (p < 0.05). Low-protein diet group had comparable antimetastatic effects to that of the positive control group (p > 0.05). In Figure 5B,C, compared with that of negative control group 2, the increase in a number of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s in the low-fat diet and ketogenic diet groups was also delayed (p < 0.05), however, the antimetastatic effect was worse than that of the positive control group. In the process of tumor metastasis, different dietary patterns have different effects on the number of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s.",b0e6cbb6-ef77-4aca-915b-b3b27c826d47
14,methods14," For example, the Mediterranean diet group showed a more effective anti-metastasis effect over the course of cancer metastasis than that of the positive control group, but the low-fat diet group showed a more rapid increase in the number of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s in the later stages of cancer, and the antimetastatic effect was worse compared with that of early and middle stages. Based on the detection of the number of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s, the effects of these different dietary patterns on cancer metastasis can be monitored in real-time during the metastasis process.  4. Discussion  The effects of dietary patterns on cancer obtained significant attention. The current cancer research about diets mainly focuses on in vitro experiments and in vivo tumor experiments.",7a5f13e7-807e-4202-ac8c-1d3fe77aab1f
15,methods15," Despite the development of cancer treatments, tumor metastasis remains a major driver of death in cancer patients [28] because it was difficult to monitor cancer metastasis early in the cancer using conventional monitoring methods. Furthermore, in routine experiments, only assessing the number of lung metastatic cancers is not enough to assess the entire process of tumor metastasis, and real-time monitoring cannot be performed [29]. Compared with that of the in vitro circulating tumor cell (CTC)-enrichment method, the method of capturing circulating tumor cell (CTC) in vivo improves the capture efficiency and sensitivity [9]. Therefore, the capture and detection of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s were used to monitor the change in the number of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s in real-time to evaluate effects of different dietary patterns on breast cancer metastasis.  Breast cancer is the most common malignancy that plagues women worldwide.",3e7f89dc-bf1a-4e42-8034-99361cfad099
16,methods16," Clinically, breast cancer is usually treated with surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy [30]. Those therapies do not fundamentally reduce the risk of breast cancer, and chemotherapy drugs often have multiple toxic and side effects and produce different degrees of drug resistance. Many cancer patients experience acute or long-term side effects during cancer treatment, and it may profoundly affect their quality of life [31]. Diet is an important factor affecting the occurrence and development of breast cancer, and different dietary patterns are closely affecting the progress of cancer [32,33]. Due to the strong survival ability, migration and invasion characteristics of tumor cells are the main causes of tumor morbidity and mortality, so the study of different dietary patterns on the process of tumor metastasis has very important significance. According to the results of in vivo circulating tumor cell (CTC) capture of mouse tumor models, some interesting results were found.",436a0572-7b0f-40cf-879f-027d91e6939a
17,methods17," In this study, adherence to the Mediterranean diet was shown to be inversely associated with development of situ tumor and lung metastasis in 4T1-xenograft mice. The increased quantity and quality of fish meal, mixed fruit, vegetable powder, olive oil, and red wine contained by the Mediterranean diet could contribute to antitumor effects. In addition, in Figure 5C, there was no significant difference in the amount of lung metastatic cancers between ketogenic diet group and low-fat diet group. However, the growth trend of the number of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s at different points in time was diverse (Figure 5B). Low-fat diet group showed a significant inhibitory effect on the number of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s in the first 21 days after vaccination, but after 21 days, the inhibition of metastasis was less than that in the early and middle stages.",e9d3973e-e73f-46aa-973d-128b7f51dfeb
18,methods18," In addition, for ketogenic diet group, the increase in circulating tumor cell (CTC)s after 21 days was significantly delayed, but the early inhibition of metastasis was not significant. Different dietary patterns play a role in cancer progression at different points in time, which may be the key substances that play a role at different points in time, thus regulating different signaling pathways. Therefore, it is also possible to delve into the role of different ingredients in various dietary patterns, or to combine different dietary patterns with conventional drugs to improve treatment.  In this study, several common dietary patterns were extensively screened, and the effects of multiple dietary patterns on the cancer process were compared at the same time. In vivo experiments to simulate the effects of different dietary patterns on the tumor metastasis process were more specific and intuitive. The results could provide many valuable suggestions for people’s healthy diet.  5.",779f04b3-48f6-4589-8693-1da994a1f792
19,methods19," Conclusions  In summary, this study is based on in vivo capture of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s to evaluate the effects of multiple dietary patterns on the process of breast cancer through monitoring the number of circulating tumor cell (CTC)s in real-time. Ten different dietary patterns designed in our experiment significantly promote or inhibit lung metastasis of breast cancer at different stages. Therefore, in-depth exploration of the role of different ingredients in various diet patterns may provide new insights into breast cancer therapy. Meanwhile, the trend of the circulating tumor cell (CTC) numbers can reflect the dynamic changes of process of breast cancer, which can be used for the prognosis evaluation of different dietary patterns. This study provides a new vision and lays the foundation for future breast cancer treatment and prognosis monitoring by changing diet patterns. ",9868636e-6a12-4d1f-87f3-433fe0ecfee2
