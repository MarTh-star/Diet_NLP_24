1,methods1," Olive Oil Samples Preparation The olive oil samples were obtained using olive fruits from a batch of the same olive trees of the variety Oblica. All olive trees were grown under the same agronomic and environmental conditions on the Ugljan isle (central part of Croatian Adriatic, nearby the city of Zadar). After harvesting in the 2016 season, fresh olive fruits (50.0 kg) were immediately processed by centrifugal line (Olimio, 150 kg, Enologia Mori, Tuscany, Italy) giving virgin olive oil (Virgin olive oil (VOO)). The other fresh olive fruits (50.0 kg) were kept in the seawater for ten days and then removed from the seawater and processed on the same line giving “seawater olive oil” (Virgin olive oil (VOO)-Sea). All samples were transferred in dark glass bottles without headspace and stored in the dark at 4 °C until analysis.  2.3. Phenolic Compounds 2.3.1.",c9fbf46d-ba57-45c3-b578-df5cf16f52e4

Identification and Quantification of Phenolic Compounds In this study the comparison of the phenolic profile of Virgin olive oil (VOO) prepared from immediately processed fresh olive fruits, and Virgin olive oil (VOO)-Sea prepared from fruits that were kept in seawater for ten days before processing, was performed. Olive fruits were collected from the same olive trees of the variety Oblica from the Ugljan isle (central part of Croatian Adriatic, near to the city of Zadar) in the 2016 season.  The phenolic profiles of the oils after extraction of phenolic compounds by optimized US-LLE method (Section 2.3.1) were analyzed using different methods (Section 2.3.2, Section 2.3.3, Section 2.3.4).",7a957f9b-5495-4e33-a203-4f645659060f
13,methods13," The High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detector (DAD) analysis of phenolic extracts showed several peaks corresponding to different phenolics (Figure 1 and Figure 2) determined under the chromatographic conditions described above (Section 2.3.2). Those peaks correspond to the important bioactive compounds hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol and oleacein and another 11 minor phenolic compounds. Phenolic acids like 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, o-coumaric acid and syringic acid were below the limit of detection in Virgin olive oil (VOO) and Virgin olive oil (VOO)-Sea.  Oleacein (peak 10), the most abundant secoiridoid in all analyzed oil samples, was firstly identified by its Rt tentatively according to the literature [17]. Identity of oleacein was confirmed by MS analysis (Section 2.3.3).",565cbb77-c222-4126-8578-dc6558376a0f
14,methods14," Analysis of fragmentation of molecules in electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS spectra (Figures S1 and S2 in Supplementary Materials) also confirmed the presence of other bioactive secoiridoids (oleocanthal, oleuropein aglycone and ligstroside aglycone) in Virgin olive oil (VOO) and Virgin olive oil (VOO)-Sea but quantification was not possible (peaks were not resolved). The extracted-ion chromatograms (EICs) generated for PE (Figure S1b in Supplementary material) and PE-Sea (Figure S2b in Supplementary Materials), gave the deprotonated molecule at m/z 639, 319, 195, 183, 165, 59 which demonstrates the presence of oleacein [18]. The EIC chromatograms on Figures S1c and S2c showed m/z 607, 361, 303, 291, 285, 259, 179, 165, 139 in full-scan mode.",7cf87bfa-94a5-42d1-939d-5959fe69b3ce
15,methods15," According to the literature, these m/z 361, 291, 259, 139 peaks may correspond to ligstroside aglycone isomers (ligstroside aglycone mono-aldehyde; p-HPEA-EA) and m/z 607, 303, 285, 179, 165 peaks correspond to open ring decarboxylated dialdehidic form of ligstroside derivative, oleocanthal (dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to tyrosol; p-HPEA-EDA) [18]. Figures S1d and S2d show EIC chromatograms of PE and PE-Sea with fragmentation m/z 755, 377, 345, 307, 275, 139 which correspond to oleuropein aglycone (oleuropein aglycone mono-aldehyde, 3,4-DHPEA-EA) [18].  The phenolic compound concentrations (mg/kg Virgin olive oil (VOO) or Virgin olive oil (VOO)-Sea) are shown in Table 1.  The determined concentrations of hydroxytyrosol in Virgin olive oil (VOO) and Virgin olive oil (VOO)-Sea, that amount to 18.2 mg/kg and 12.9 mg/kg, respectively, are generally in the range similar to the values in some Spanish (6.9–72.7 mg/kg of oil) or Italian EVirgin olive oil (VOO)s (0.",b68ef8e5-89a4-41f2-8798-83e2c2ead8cc

Furthermore, the tyrosol concentration determined in Virgin olive oil (VOO) and Virgin olive oil (VOO)-Sea (8.10 mg/kg and 7.20 mg/kg respectively) is very similar to the values in the same literature.  The concentrations of total phenols, o-diphenols, total flavonoids and EC50 values of phenolic extracts were determined spectrophotometrically and are summarized in Table 2. The values of TP and o-diphenols found in Virgin olive oil (VOO) and Virgin olive oil (VOO)-Sea are frequently greater in comparison with the values of TP and o-diphenols in Virgin olive oil (VOO)s from other countries [23,24,25,26,27].  3.2.",663fb908-b314-431f-89d0-b75e07d454bb
17,methods17," Effect of Storage of Olive Fruits in the Seawater on the Phenolic Profile of Olive Oil The present study concentrates on the question as to whether the olives contained bioactive phenolic compounds that were eventually preserved or lost during the storage of the fruits in seawater before further processing. Inspection of Table 1 and Table 2 and Figure 3 shows that about one half of the phenolics in general were retained in the “seawater olive oil” as compared with the Virgin olive oil (VOO) obtained by immediate common mechanical processing of freshly picked olives.  At least with regard to the Oblica variety studied, the most abundant olive variety in Croatia, about two thirds of the total phenolic content as well as the content of the o-diphenols were retained in the “seawater oil”. In our opinion, there are no obvious reasons to expect a very different pattern with other varieties because we expect the epicarp of olive fruit could be of similar permeability.",12d97eb4-8403-41e6-8845-6b58ae5da543
18,methods18," Similarly, the value of EC50, as one possible measure of antioxidant activity, is increased for Virgin olive oil (VOO)-Sea not more than 40 % compared to parent Virgin olive oil (VOO), corresponding to not more than a 40% decrease in antioxidant activity. The sum of quantified bioactive phenolic compounds (Table 1) is reduced to half (from 334.7 mg/kg Virgin olive oil (VOO) to 165.6 mg/kg Virgin olive oil (VOO)-Sea) but it is important that hydroxytyrosol, biomedically one of the most important phenolic compounds [6] in EVirgin olive oil (VOO)s, and tyrosol, known also for beneficial health effects [28], are preserved to 71 and 89% of the EVirgin olive oil (VOO) figure, respectively. Furthermore, there is no phenolic acid or derivative that has been retained less than 58%, except in the case of vanillin where 43% of the content in EVirgin olive oil (VOO) remained.",327cc153-517f-4c61-9277-6f912220171a
19,methods19," However, in the case of homovanillyl alcohol, p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid, the corresponding figures are 58, 70 and 81%, respectively. Interestingly, the “seawater oil” appears to comprise more vanillic acid than the parent EVirgin olive oil (VOO) (50% increase).  Oleacein, known to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and antimicrobial activities [3,29], is found to be abundant in the examined EVirgin olive oil (VOO) of the Oblica variety from the isle of Ugljan; the oil is rich in this hydroxytyrosol derivative, containing 300 mg/kg, see Table 1. The “seawater oil” contains 138 mg/kg, 46% of the amount in EVirgin olive oil (VOO), nevertheless a significant concentration of oleacein when compared with the literature data for the Oblica variety [22,30]. However, it is necessary to note that the average concentrations of oleacein can reach levels as high as 840 mg/kg, as was detected in some Italian EVirgin olive oil (VOO)s [20].",db07bd07-75c1-4fcd-8246-965094ea0787
20,methods20,"  The content of pinoresinol and apigenin [4] has been modified. Moreover, the content of apigenin is 70% greater in “seawater oil”. The results correspond with research conducted by Hachicha et al. [31], whose findings suggest that the apigenin content in olive fruit increases in storage. This suggests that certain biochemical processes in olive fruit are still underway but probably at a slower pace.  Analysis of fragmentation of molecules in electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS spectra confirmed the presence of bioactive secoiridoids: oleacein, oleocanthal, oleuropein aglycone and ligstroside aglycone in Virgin olive oil (VOO) and in “seawater olive oil”. Oleocanthal especially attracts attention, as it has been compared to ibuprofen [7] and also exerts other biological activities [3,8].  The difference in phenolic profile among Virgin olive oil (VOO) and Virgin olive oil (VOO)-Sea was moreover confirmed by statistical analysis.",70858000-9696-477e-9017-a322e53fe80e
21,methods21," Correlation tests reveal different correlation profiles pertaining to a particular olive processing (Tables S3 and S4 in Supplementary Materials). principal component analysis (PCA) performed on the chemical data shows clustering of the samples on the basis of the effect of storage of olives in seawater prior to processing. Using only three PCs, 97.9% variance is retained (Figures S3 and S4 in Supplementary Materials).  Although we have determined a loss of phenolic compounds in Virgin olive oil (VOO)-Sea, the loss would be even greater in the case of open-air storage [31]. The enzyme activity in the fruit has probably been reduced and some of the oxidation processes have not occurred due to a lower oxygen concentration in the seawater. The presence of pathogenic bacteria and fungi in the fruit is also reduced [32].",442b636d-a814-4cf2-967c-9ecd7b17ee9a
22,methods22,"  Taken together, the comparison between the data for the two olive oils, the Virgin olive oil (VOO) obtained from freshly picked and immediately mechanically processed olive fruits of the Oblica variety from Ugljan isle, and the “seawater oil” obtained from the corresponding sample of olive fruits stored in seawater for 10 days prior to common processing, could suggest that despite the reduction in the content of bioactive compounds as a result of storage in seawater, its content is above the values in other varieties of olives and oils. Moreover, when olives of high quality with respect to the content of phenolics are in question, as in the case of the Oblica variety would be expected, the “seawater oils” can be competitive with regard to the biomedical usefulness taking into consideration olive varieties and oils less abundant in the phenolics. In addition, the studies on oil quality have reported no substantial differences with regard to the overall oil quality [33,34].",49c2a1e1-349a-4052-9b66-e0fc45faf239
23,methods23," Insofar as the market and the habits of the customers go, “seawater oil” is still very popular.  4. Conclusions The bioactive phenolic compounds in olive oil obtained from fruits stored for ten days in seawater prior to common mechanical processing into oil are partially preserved in the oil. Especially, this should be the case when the olive fruits used are of high quality with respect to the content of the important bioactive phenolics. More favorable results are expected with only several days storage, which is most frequently the case in the actual practice. Therefore, these oils, here denoted as “seawater olive oils”, should be considered as oils that are still of some biomedical relevance, although they are of somewhat less biomedical value than the parent EVirgin olive oil (VOO)s with high amount of the phenolics possessing favorable healthy effects.
