0,introduction0,"Sarcopenia (the presence of low skeletal muscle mass and low muscle function) is an increasingly prevalent condition in our ageing populations [1, 2]. Sarcopenia is associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, including physical disability, frailty, and incidence of osteoporosis, falls, and fractures, thus increasing health care costs, and so, it is crucial to identify preventative strategies. Such strategies may be identified in the study of the continuum of the loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, or function (muscle outcomes) with age using epidemiological techniques [1, 3]. Recent evidence has highlighted that the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, or function individually, or in combination, are also associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures.",f4198445-a132-473e-a565-f77a6eeeadfe
1,introduction1," This may be due to either the potential hormonal or endocrine interactions between skeletal muscle and bone, muscle force-generated mechanical signals, compensation during loss of balance or by acting as a protective barrier to reduce the impact of falls [3, 4]. The mechanisms contributing to the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function with age include chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress, which trigger catabolism and an increase in protein turnover in skeletal muscle [3, 5].  The total quality of the diet measured as food patterns has recently been recognized as important as foods may have “synergistic and cumulative effects on health and disease” beyond the effect of single nutrients [6].",c88e7b23-f1d6-4173-ab87-1ce0359bc598
2,introduction2," The Mediterranean diet (MD) is characterized by high intakes of fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, cereals, and olive oil with low intakes of saturated fat, moderately high intakes of fish, low to moderate intakes of dairy products, low intake of meat, and regular but moderate intake of alcohol [7].  Evidence has been accumulating for the protective effect of the MD for mortality and chronic diseases in particular, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and cancer [6, 8–10]. Moreover, the recent US dietary guidelines encourage an eating pattern aligned to the MD [6]. In addition to the whole diet, key food components within the MD score (MDS) have been found to predict chronic disease outcomes, and higher adherence to the MD has been associated with lower circulating inflammatory markers (or cytokines), including C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) [10, 11].",d46df1b0-00d3-4d81-bb53-7f23b1cf3944
3,introduction3," Higher adherence to the MD may also be important for the conservation of skeletal muscle outcomes via the rich concentration of micronutrients associated with higher adherence to the score which may act through their potential anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties (for example vitamins C and E, magnesium and carotenoids) or through a direct role in muscle metabolism and physiology, such as with magnesium and potassium [3, 12–14].  To date, only two cross-sectional and two prospective cohort studies have examined the Mediterranean diet pattern and direct measures of grip or knee strength with only one of these in a population with more than 1000 participants [7, 15–18]. No studies have comprehensively investigated the MD with directly measured skeletal muscle mass, grip strength, muscle function, and low-grade inflammation concurrently in the same population [7, 15–18].",90f8aade-f3f2-4a68-973a-1337a2d191b2
4,introduction4," Therefore, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate associations between the MD and directly measured muscle outcomes in a cross-sectional study in free-living adult women in a northern European country. We further aimed to investigate the association between the inflammatory marker C reactive protein (CRP) and the MD, and to determine whether the individual food components of the MD score (MDS) related independently to muscle outcomes.

5,methods0,"The women included in this study were from the TwinsUK registry which is an ongoing study of healthy adult twins recruited from the general population who are representative of adult singleton populations in the UK [19, 20]. Data were used from two subsets of this cohort, approach 1 included 2570 women who had completed a food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) and attended for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) measurements between 1996 and 2000 (referred to as the “approach 1” in this manuscript). Within approach 1, there were 1914 individuals with measures of leg explosive power and 1658 individuals who also had measures of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-C reactive protein (CRP)). The second group (“approach 2”) consisted of women who had completed an food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and had dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) and grip strength measurements measured between 2005 and 2008, see Fig. 1.",4f51dc92-7cd3-4437-adb1-da450db4bb89

7,methods2," Scoring was based on the intake of the following nine items: vegetables, legumes, fruit and nuts, dairy products, cereals, meat and meat products, fish, alcohol, and the ratio of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated/saturated fat (unsaturated/saturated fat). For food items considered healthy, consumption above the study median received 1 point; all other intakes received 0 point. For dairy products, meat and meat products, consumption below the median received 1 point. For alcohol, women who consumed 5–25 g/day received 1 point; otherwise, the score was 0. The possible scores ranged between 0 and 9, the latter reflecting the maximal adherence. Individuals were excluded from the dietary analyses if answers to >10 food items were left blank or the ratio of estimated total energy intake to the estimated basal metabolic rate fell 2 SDs outside the mean ratio. The dietary intake data was estimated for the appropriate time period for the both approaches.",d025c4b0-e50c-4308-8122-f5902c564e7f

Muscle mass, strength, and power Fat-free mass (Fat free mass (FFM)) was measured by dual-X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) (Hologic QDR-2000 dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner, Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Percentage fat-free mass (Fat free mass (FFM)%) was calculated as (Fat free mass (FFM) (kg) / weight (kg) × 100) and fat-free mass index (Fat free mass (FFM)I) in kg/m2 as (Fat free mass (FFM) (kg) / (height (m)2) [25].

9,methods4," Isometric grip strength was assessed using a Jamar hand grip dynamometer (Sammons, Preston, UK) on the dominant arm with reproducibility assessed by repeated measurement on 24 individuals (CV of 11.4 %) [26]. Arm muscle quality was calculated as the ratio of grip strength to mean arm lean mass. Leg explosive power (Leg explosive power (LEP)) was used to measure physical fitness using the Nottingham power rig which measures the force and velocity of muscle contraction principally from the quadriceps [27]. Measurements were normalized for body weight ((Leg explosive power (LEP) (w) / weight (kg)) × mean weight (kg)). Leg explosive power (LEP) has been validated and is highly reliable (reliability coefficient 0.97, coefficient of variation 9.4 %, over 1-week period in adults) [27].",0e4d4f7c-18d6-411e-8fcc-b141fffb6d8a
10,methods5,"  C-reactive protein Circulating high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-C reactive protein (CRP)) was measured by a highly sensitive automated microparticle capture enzyme immunoassay, standardized on the World Health Organization International Reference Standard for C reactive protein (CRP) immunoassay as previously described [28].  Covariates Weight and height were measured with height measured to the nearest 0.5 cm and weight to the nearest 0.1 kg. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms (kg) divided by height in meters squared (m2). Information on lifestyle, medication use, menopausal status, and demographic variables were obtained using a standardized nurse-administered questionnaire. Physical activity was classified as heavy, moderate, or inactive during work, home, and leisure time using a questionnaire that has been strongly correlated with a more in depth assessment of physical activity in this cohort [29].",88dd4f6c-753e-4ac1-9bbf-1e9f90548303

In order to check the consistency in data between both approaches, we ran the models for fat-free mass in both the first and second approach. Analyses were conducted for all participants and then stratified by age (<50 and ≥50 years).

12,methods7," Protein was included in the models since this has an established role in muscle metabolism, and total energy was included to account for overall differences in energy intake between people of different sizes, an established epidemiological technique [3, 30]. Fat free mass (FFM)I was additionally adjusted for fat mass (kg), and arm muscle quality and Leg explosive power (LEP) were also adjusted for menopausal status (premenopausal/ postmenopausal), use of HRT (yes/no), and height (m). Hs-C reactive protein (CRP) was also adjusted for BMI, use of anti-inflammatory medications (yes/no) and HRT (yes/no). Values for hs-C reactive protein (CRP) were skewed, and therefore, natural log-transformed values were used for the analyses.

For Fat free mass (FFM)%, using a conservative estimate from a longitudinal study of loss of 0.7 % Fat free mass (FFM) per year, our finding of 1.7 % between extreme quartiles of the MD score (MDS) is 2.4 times that of the measured loss of Fat free mass (FFM) per year [3, 32, 33].",f4803b8f-c384-490c-a64a-23a36964db3c
25,discussion2," To our knowledge, this is the first representative population study to investigate associations between the MD score (MDS) in a northern European population and risk factors for sarcopenia and frailty, as previous studies have all focused on older adults, although it is known that age-related declines in muscle mass occur as a continuum in younger as well as older adults [7, 15–17, 34, 35]. Furthermore, when stratified by age the associations with the MD in population for Leg explosive power (LEP) were greater for women aged over 50 years, compared to those aged under 50 years, with the between quartile differences being 5 % greater in older than in younger women. Differences in Fat free mass (FFM)% were also greater but for Fat free mass (FFM)I the difference across quantiles was significant only in women aged less than 50 years. Interestingly, we observed no associations between the MD score (MDS) and arm muscle quality or C-reactive protein in our study.",775ac5d6-78b0-42ae-8cdc-eeecc6fb0c3a
26,discussion3,"  The lack of association between the MD score (MDS) and grip strength in our study is similar to four previous studies that directly measured muscle strength and the MD, all in older populations, finding no association or a significant positive association only in unadjusted analyses [7, 15–18]. The only other study that related skeletal muscle mass (as appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height2) to the MD score (MDS) (defined a posteriori) found no association between skeletal muscle mass or of sarcopenia in Iranian men and women [34]. Also, a recent study in older Chinese men and women found no association between prevalent or incident sarcopenia and the MD score (MDS) during 4 years of follow-up [36].",b8e6d9c8-66a3-4d9a-99e0-816f07555659
27,discussion4," Although our findings are in line with previous studies, our lack of association between the MD score (MDS) and grip strength may be because age is such a strong determinant in cross-sectional studies, and the mean hand grip strength in our study was higher than that found in a previous study of older women in the UK [37]. However, our analyses to determine consistency between the approaches in this study for skeletal muscle outcomes demonstrated the same associations between indices of Fat free mass (FFM) and the MD score (MDS) in women over time.  Our further investigation of the food categories that contributed to the MD score (MDS) and the muscle outcomes of Fat free mass (FFM)%, Fat free mass (FFM)I, and Leg explosive power (LEP) found that cereals, fruits, and vegetables were positively and significantly related. Alcohol intake was also positively related to Fat free mass (FFM)% and Leg explosive power (LEP).",b170083c-7d26-4fa4-81bd-d7acead7265d
28,discussion5," However, the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fats (the total of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat) related to Leg explosive power (LEP) only, although we previously found a relationship between Fat free mass (FFM)I and the P/S (total polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat) ratio in this population [38]. Surprisingly, we also found a significant inverse association between meat consumption and Fat free mass (FFM)% and Leg explosive power (LEP) that was independent of protein intake. The explanation for this is unknown although we previously reported an inverse relationship between a greater dietary acid-base load and indices of skeletal muscle mass [39, 40]. Meat is a major contributor to the dietary acid-base load, with fruits and vegetables acting to alkalinize dietary intake [39, 40].",ba9c2aca-525d-4ecb-b2e5-7648a2fc9af4
29,discussion6," We found no independent association with arm muscle quality and total fish intake in comparison with the one other study that found a positive association with grip strength and fatty fish consumption in older women living in the UK [37]. However, importantly, the association with the MD score (MDS) which characterizes a combined approach to healthy eating was greater than any of its individual components.  We anticipated, on the basis of previous research, that the MD score (MDS) may influence inflammation and therefore be a mechanism that might potentially explain the link between muscle outcomes and the MD score (MDS); however, we did not find a relationship in this study [14]. This may be for a number of reasons including the fact that the mean concentrations of circulating C reactive protein (CRP) were low in our cohort, due to the age range, or that more than one measure of an inflammatory cytokine would better capture inflammatory status.",32156dad-f684-4cd5-92ab-af13aa14e34e
30,discussion7," It may also be that the distribution of potentially anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory nutrients and foods associated with the MD, within a northern European country, may not be as great as in studies of the MD performed within Mediterranean countries [41, 42]. Alternatively, the benefits of the MD score (MDS) in a European population on skeletal muscle outcomes may be due to other mechanisms such as effects on the gut microbiota, which has been linked to the MD in human studies, and to markers of muscle atrophy in animal studies [43]. Further work is warranted using alternative markers of inflammation.  The strengths of this study include the large sample size and the wide age range of participants, as most previous studies on sarcopenia, or the muscle outcomes associated with sarcopenia, focused only on older individuals. Moreover, this was the first study that compared the MD score (MDS) with directly measured indices of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function in a large cohort.",fdc0fd06-190a-467b-82ec-e488f9b5a369
31,discussion8," The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used in the current study was previously validated for protein, vitamin C, potassium, sodium, and n-3 PUFAs and has been shown to rank episodically consumed foods, such as fish, equally well when compared with other dietary methods [30, 44, 45]. The observed findings relate to women and further work is needed to investigate if these findings are replicated in a male population of the same country or in populations from different ethnic backgrounds.  Our study also has limitations, which warrant discussion. The cross-sectional nature of the study limits causal inference between the MD score (MDS) and muscle outcomes. Although low-grade inflammation was measured using circulating C reactive protein (CRP), the lower concentrations found in this population may have been insufficient to relate to an effect of overall diet.",48157e8e-0451-4119-947c-2feef1155026
32,discussion9," Higher adherence to the MD score (MDS) may also be an indicator of a healthy lifestyle, and even though our analyses were adjusted for all the known lifestyle factors that impact on muscle outcomes, residual confounding cannot be ruled out.  In conclusion, we found that diet quality assessed by the predefined MD score (MDS) is positively associated with indices of skeletal muscle mass and function in women of different ages. Moreover, our findings may have clinical relevance as the scale of associations found were 2.4 and 3.5 times the measured loss of Fat free mass (FFM) and Leg explosive power (LEP) per year, respectively, even after accounting for covariates.",ac7bc977-ff7c-4391-a3e8-64057a74fb22
33,discussion10," These novel findings suggest that for adult women a healthier dietary pattern of the MD score (MDS) specifically of higher intakes in fruit and vegetables, cereal foods, the unsaturated to saturated fat ratio and alcohol along with lower intakes of meats, may be important in reducing the loss of skeletal muscle mass strength and function with age. These findings provide important information in developing and planning potential dietary intervention trials for the prevention of sarcopenia. From a public health perspective, our findings support the current healthy eating guidelines to consume a diet high in plant and whole grain cereal foods that is lower in saturated fat intakes and suggest that a healthy eating pattern characterized by the MD score (MDS) could be beneficial for skeletal muscle outcomes.
