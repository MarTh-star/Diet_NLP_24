0,background0," Depression imposes immense public health burden, demonstrating an urgent need of the identification of modifiable risk factors. Only a few cohort studies have analyzed the association between Mediterranean dietary pattern (Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP)) and depression but with mixed results. We examined the impact of Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) on clinically ascertained depression in a large population-based dataset. ",91da0504-7974-4ce8-a907-0c0ab4eb5411
1,methods0," In 1991/92, detailed information on diet, using a food frequency questionnaire, and potential confounding factors (body weight, height, educational attainment, smoking, previous diabetes and hypertension, and physical activity) was collected, in a random sample of 49,261 Swedish women aged 29-49. Adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) was calculated. Clinical depression was extracted from the National Patient Register. Study participants were followed up through 2012.   Between August 1991 and March 1992, a random sample of 96,000 women at age 29-49 and residing in the Uppsala healthcare region of Sweden was drawn from the Total Population Register by Statistics Sweden. These women were invited to participate in the Women’s Lifestyle and Health (Women’s Lifestyle and Health (WLH)) study, through answering a comprehensive questionnaire including food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) at the cohort entry [20].",05914b2b-af14-4093-a06d-00fc153081af
2,methods1," Among the women invited, 49,261 returned the questionnaire and were enrolled in the study. All eligible participants were followed from cohort entry as defined by return of the questionnaire in 1991/92 until the first diagnosis of depression, date of emigration, death, or December 31, 2012, whichever came first, through cross linkages to the Swedish Patient Register (for ascertainment of depression) and Total Population Register (for ascertainment of emigration and death), using the individually unique personal identity numbers [21].  Adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP)  At cohort entry, the study participants were asked to recall their dietary habits during the six months before enrolment, through answering an food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which assessed the frequency and quantity of consumption of approximately 80 food items and beverages [22].",f47b806a-7468-4da6-90a0-f16ec624a25d
3,methods2," The consumption (grams/day) of each item and total energy intake (kilo-Joule (kJ)/day) were calculated using the Swedish National Food Administration database [23]. To measure adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP), we used the scale proposed by Trichopoulou et al. [9, 24] which has been used extensively in different studies including the Women’s Lifestyle and Health (WLH) study [25].  Altogether, nine food groups were constructed as index dietary components, namely vegetables, fruits and nuts, cereals, legumes, dairy products, fish and seafood, meat, alcohol, and monounsaturated-to-saturated fat (M/S) ratio. For dietary components that are presumed to be beneficial (i.e., vegetables, fruits and nuts, cereals, legumes, fish and seafood, and a high M/S ratio), we scored a woman that consumed below the median level of the entire cohort as “0” and a woman that consumed at or above the cohort median as 1. For dietary components that are presumed to be less beneficial (i.e.",55810933-1b99-4e8e-aa52-61bdfd534152
4,methods3,", dairy and meat products), a consumption level below the cohort median was given a score of 1 whereas a consumption level at or above the cohort median was given a score of 0. A moderate level of alcohol consumption (5-25 g/day) was scored 1, or 0 otherwise. Scores on all nine components were then summed up as a proxy for adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP), with the value 0 as the minimal and 9 as the maximal adherence [24].  Diagnosis of depression  The outcome of the study was the first clinical diagnosis of depression during follow-up. The Swedish Patient Register includes nationwide complete information on inpatient psychiatric care since 1973 and outpatient specialist care since 2001, updated on a daily basis [26]. A clinical diagnosis of depression was identified using the Swedish revisions of the International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-7: 301.1, ICD-8: 296.2, ICD-9: 296B, and ICD-10: F32 and F33).",109f729c-2401-49c5-85be-39d69d49b7fe
5,methods4," The date of first hospital visit concerning depression was used as date of diagnosis for depression.  In a sensitivity analysis, we used both a broader (either ≥1 dispense of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or clinical diagnosis of depression) and a narrower (both dispense of SSRIs and clinical diagnosis of depression) definition to assess the soundness of the main results. Information on dispense of SSRIs was derived from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register (nationwide available since July 2005) using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification code N06AB. We also used ICD-10 codes F32.2, F32.3, F33.2 and F33.3 to identify severe depression, to assess if the role of adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) would differ for severe depression.",87dff40d-0c21-40f1-8dfe-7a3ce716b9fd
6,methods5,"  Covariates  We considered a range of demographic factors, lifestyle factors, anthropometric profile, and medical history as potential confounders of the studied association, including age (years, continuous), calendar year of birth (continuous), body weight (kg, continuous), height (cm, continuous), total years of education (years, continuous), smoking status (never, former or current), previous diabetes and hypertension (yes or no), as well as level of physical activity (on a 5-point scale ranging from mainly sitting as level 1 to vigorous physical activity as level 5), all collected from the questionnaires at baseline. ",ecd418d0-b5b6-4d6c-a992-6c67f85f8b2b
7,analysis0," We calculated incidence rates of depression standardized by age using all person-time experienced by the entire cohort as the standard. Association of adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) with the risk of depression was estimated by hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% profile likelihood confidence intervals (CIs) obtained from the Cox models. The underlying time scale was attained age [27]. Adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) was analyzed both as a categorical (0-3 low, 4-5 medium, or 6-9 high) and continuous (0-9) variable. In the minimally adjusted model, we adjusted for year of birth (1942-46, 1947-51, 1952-56, or 1957-62). In the fully adjusted model, we additionally adjusted for body mass index (BMI, < 25, 25-29.",972e2a5c-4580-406a-b5bf-76837550dd56

Since effect of diet can expect to increase cumulatively with higher age, we repeated the analyses in women younger than 50 and in women aged 50 and older. The cumulative incidence rate of depression over age by adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) was plotted using Kaplan-Meier method. Natural cubic splines were fitted to display the trend of depression risk across Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) score (0-9), adjusted for attained age, birth year, BMI, smoking, physical activity, education, diabetes, hypertension, and total energy intake.",074d3353-8c16-480f-996d-b6c754c3801e
9,analysis2,"  Sensitivity and supplementary analyses  We tested the robustness of our results through a series of sensitivity analyses. To rule out the possibility of reverse causation, we excluded the first two or five years of follow-up. To address the concern for residual confounding due to a single assessment of dietary habit, we limited the follow-up time to the end of 2002 to estimate the association over the first 10 years of follow-up. We further repeated the age-specific analysis within the first 10 years and the second 10 years of follow-up respectively. We used alternative definitions for depression (broader or narrower definition, and severe depression).",c9a8d244-b702-4603-8ac6-0b3754e5bb42
10,analysis3," To address the influence of other psychiatric comorbidity, we first adjusted the analysis for history of any other psychiatric disorders (ICD-7: 300-326, ICD-8: 290-315, ICD-9: 290-319 and ICD-10: F10-99, excluding ICD codes for depression) before the end of follow-up, and then performed another analysis restricted to women without any psychiatric history before enrolment. The correlations between the nine dietary components and adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) score were calculated using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients. To check the influence of different food components, we performed another analysis by excluding the nine components one by one from the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) score.",72023cac-a4a1-4579-9d36-12a62af26c86
11,analysis4," Finally, given the potential distinct health effects of red and white meat, we re-calculated the adherence score based only on red and processed meat [29] instead of all kinds of meat products, and also separately assessed the association of red meat with risk of depression.  The assumption of proportional hazards was assessed by examining the standardized Schoenfeld residuals [30]. All statistical tests were performed on the two-sided 5% level of significance, corresponding to a two-sided 95% CI. We did not perform any adjustment of p-values for multiplicity of statistical tests. Data management was performed using SAS software version 9. 4 (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Survival analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4. The cumulative incidence rate and the age-specific analysis were performed using STATA version 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).

The final study cohort comprised of 46,942 women. After exclusion of women with missing data on any of the covariates, 42,515 women with a mean age of 39.5 years (standard deviation = 5.6) remained in the final analysis (Fig. S1). No major differences existed between the women excluded due to missing data and the women included in the final analysis (Table S1).  During the average follow-up of 20.4 years, we identified 1677 women with incident depression, leading to an incidence rate of 1.94 per 1000 person-years.",dd54e86c-710e-40ba-a9cb-9ea0eaa94926

Per unit increase of adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP), there was a 5% lower risk of depression in the fully adjusted models. The observed protective effect appeared to increase with age. The HRs were higher from age 50 onward (HRadj = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.64-0.89, high vs low adherence), compared with before age 50 (HRadj = 1.00, 95%CI = 0.78-1.27, high vs low adherence) (Table 2).",17e45cdd-d8c5-4d2e-96e8-42ed2fbebcea

18,results8," Further adjustment for psychiatric comorbidity (Table S3) or restricting analysis to women without any psychiatric disorders before enrolment (Table S4) did not change the results either. Excluding other kinds of meat (e.g., white meat) from the adherence score led to largely similar results (Table S5). The correlations between individual dietary components and adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) are shown in Table S6. The results remained robust after exclusion of individual food components from the adherence score (Fig. S2). There was no strong support for lack of proportional hazards (Fig. S3).

20,discussion0," In this, to date, largest prospective cohort study examining the association between adherence to Mediterranean-style diet and risk of clinically ascertained depression, we observed a reduction in the risk of depression in relation to higher adherence to Mediterranean diet, compared with a lower adherence, in a dose-response pattern. Among younger women, whose causes of depression are mainly depression with probable genetic influences [31, 32], there was no, or only a small, association of the Mediterranean diet score with depression. The results remained robust after a detailed adjustment for potential confounding factors and after an extensive set of sensitivity analyses. The highest reduction in risk was observed for severe depression.  There has been a rapid growth in research concerning the role of diet in depression in recent years [6], centered on its modulation of inflammatory level [33].",b0635cc7-a55d-43f5-809e-b3b845d3e0cf
21,discussion1," As a supportive evidence, the US Nurses’ Health Study observed a positive association between increasing adherence to inflammatory diet and risk of depression [34]. Conversely, Mediterranean diet has been frequently referred as a typical food pattern with a lower level of inflammation [8], and was found to be inversely associated with risk of depression in our study. Other hypotheses are also proposed as explanations, including pathways in the oxidative and antioxidant defense systems, brain plasticity, microbiota-gut-brain axis, mitochondrial dysfunction, tryptophan–kynurenine metabolism, neurogenesis and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and epigenetics [12]. The action by diet affecting mental health is likely multifaceted and interacting, not restricted to only one pathway [12]. However, the majority of identified mechanisms nowadays are derived from animal studies; data of clinically ascertained depression in human beings are lacking.",65a8d50a-a1b3-467a-8c5d-794f70a004ee
22,discussion2,"  Previous cohort studies among women showed mixed results on the association between Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) and risk of depression [35–38]. Unlike most earlier studies, which used symptom scales or measures of self-reported depression, our study used clinically ascertained depression. Moreover, the large sample size of the present study allowed us to perform detailed adjustment for potential confounding factors and several sensitivity analyses to challenge assumptions used in the analysis, including the influence from different definitions of depression. When the broader depression definition was used (≥1 dispense of SSRIs or clinical diagnosis of depression), the protective effect from Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) diminished, whereas results remained essentially unchanged with the narrower definition (both dispense of SSRIs and clinical diagnosis of depression), compared with the main analysis.",39cf78e4-78a0-43b3-ba1c-5c2401d41854
23,discussion3," The effect became even more evident when we included only the most severe depression. Similar pattern was described in the Nurses’ Health Study between inflammatory diet and depression, with the stronger effect noted for the narrow definition whereas relatively weaker effect noted for the broad definition of depression [34]. Furthermore, the age-specific analysis showed a stronger effect with increasing age, indicating a potentially accumulative benefit of Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP). This might partly explain the null association in some of the previous studies with a shorter follow-up period [38]. Finally, our finding of reduced risk of clinical depression with Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) is consistent with recent interventional studies which exhibited reduced depressive symptoms after dietary interventions, especially for those of more severe level of depression [16–19].",03e4b09c-8200-4f60-bdad-bb233c742269
24,discussion4,"  In our cohort, women with a higher adherence to Mediterranean diet were more likely to have healthier lifestyle behaviors, characterized by being more physically active, of higher educational level, and with lower prevalence of smoking. Our extensive database allowed us to further adjust for these lifestyle factors which slightly attenuated the beneficial effect from Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP). Similarly, metabolic diseases can result in dietary habits which could modulate the risk of depression in turn [7, 14]. As obesity is known to stimulate chronic pro-inflammatory status, it is a plausible pathway linking together diet and risk of depression [39]. In our study, the results remained robust after adjusting for BMI.  Strengths of our study include the population-based sample, large cohort size, prospective ascertainment of clinically defined depression and long and virtually complete follow-up.",1d6be712-1b00-420f-a6fa-dce5e771bf1f
25,discussion5," Risk of selection bias was limited by the use of data from a health care system with equal access and recorded information on all cohort participants, independent from sociodemographic background. The same system allowed us to screen for presence of psychiatric disorders before the cohort entry.  Our study also has limitations. When at an early stage of depression, women might be more likely to have an unhealthy dietary pattern, indicating a possibility of reverse causation. To rule out potential impact of subclinical depression, we performed lag-time analyses and found that the association remained essentially unchanged after excluding the first two or five years of follow-up. Additionally, we adjusted for history of other psychiatric disorders prior to depression diagnosis in one analysis and excluded women with any psychiatric history before enrolment in another sensitive analysis. Both analyses showed largely comparable results.",c18bd751-e69f-4af0-b205-8a257833406f
26,discussion6," In the main analysis, we used calendar year of birth, BMI and years of education as categorical variables. In another model adjusting for these variables as continuous variables, we obtained very similar results as the ones from the original analyses (data not shown). The dietary pattern was measured only at enrolment. The long lag between exposure and outcome is therefore a concern because dietary pattern of the participants might have changed during the follow-up. As a result, there is a chance of misclassification of the exposure. Nevertheless, researchers have noticed that individual dietary habit is usually maintained lifelong and unlikely to change greatly over time [40, 41]. To compare the risk pattern over the first 10 years and the second 10 years of follow-up, we repeated the age-specific analysis within the two 10-year follow-up periods and found consistently a lower risk of depression in relation to greater adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP).",f08a05c2-8c0c-4f2f-86f6-9e17c600c2bd
27,discussion7," The magnitude of the association increased with increasing age, potentially suggesting a cumulative protective effect from Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) on depression across life span. Given the observational nature of the study, residual confounding due to unknown or unmeasured confounders such as stress-related factors may still have some influence on our results.  Diet, which every one of the population is exposed to, has been shown associated with overall health and various specific diseases, e.g. cardiovascular disease, cancer, premature mortality and, in this study, depression [42]. Considering the health burden of depression worldwide, these results are of great public health importance. More researchers have emphasized the importance of dietary pattern, instead of isolated nutrients [43], to achieve interactional effects and to convey easy-to-understand information to the public [44].",1f3023f8-4557-41cf-ac41-784a62ca2fbd
28,discussion8," This is in line with the intention of this study which is to raise awareness of the importance of healthy dietary pattern on mental health. Although Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) is prevalent in Mediterranean countries, the traditional dietary habits in the Scandinavian population are however not a typical Mediterranean style. Compared with a Greek cohort (EPIC) [45], the median intake levels of vegetables and fruits and nuts were much lower in our cohort (Table S6). Due to the relatively low absolute prevalence of Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP), the adherence to a dietary pattern that approximates Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) might bring about even greater benefits to the health of a population outside the Mediterranean region, like Sweden.  Conclusion  Higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet at middle age was associated with a lower risk of depression later in life among Swedish women.
