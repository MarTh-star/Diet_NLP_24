0,methods0," 2.1. Subjects, Study Design, and Setting  In total, 6209 participants of the Hamburg City Health Study (Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS)) fitted the required inclusion criteria and were selected for analysis. The Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) is a prospective cohort study conducted at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, with the aim to gain substantial knowledge on major chronic disease initiation and development [24]. Prior general and oral examination, all participants answered a questionnaire regarding their environmental conditions and lifestyle (e.g., physical condition and activity, dietary habits). The Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) has been registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT03934957). The Landesärztekammer Hamburg (State of Hamburg Chamber of Medical Practitioners, PV5131) approved the study protocol, and all participants signed an informed consent. The manuscript was written according to the studies in epidemiology (STROBE) Guidelines [25].  2.2.",516427bb-d1a7-4039-9b2d-993b6e610e1c
1,methods1," Sample Size Calculation  The periodontal cohort consisted of 1453 participants with none/mild periodontitis and 1176 participants with severe periodontitis. For the estimation of detectable effects due to healthy dietary patterns, we compared a change in the dietary score corresponding to the interquartile range [22], i.e., the half of the participants with “worse” dietary scores to the half with the “best” dietary scores. With a binomial response (mild/none vs. severe) and a significance level of 5%, we found that the study detected an effect of OR = 1.25 with 80% power. This effect is considered realistic and clinically relevant.  2.3. Assessment of Dietary Patterns  Initially developed for the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) study, the corresponding validated questionnaires were used to collect information on dietary intake [26].",ae7c1ea5-c954-4cac-a558-863561848e16
2,methods2," The current version of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ2) records the portion size and frequency of 102 food items eaten within the previous year [27]. Subsequently, energy intake, relevant food groups, and nutrients were assessed.  2.4. Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Adherence Score  The scoring scheme adapted from Folsom et al. was used to determine adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [28]. Ten equally weighted food items (frequency consumption of fruits, dairy, grains, vegetables, nuts/seeds/legumes, meat/poultry/fish, and sweets obtained from raw data) and average daily nutrients intake (e.g., saturated fat, fat, sodium) were included. The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence score could be assessed for 9020 participants. For each dietary component, a score of 0–1 was given and summed across the 10 items [29] (Table 1; score of 10 = full adherence, score of 0 = nonadherence). A score from 0 to 3.",4daee74e-051b-429d-90fb-f57cae843956
3,methods3,"5 was classified as low adherence, from 4 to 6.5 as medium adherence, and from 7 to 10 as high adherence.  2.5. Mediterranean Adherence Score (Mediterranean Adherence Score (MEDAS))  The validated German translation of the original Mediterranean Adherence Score (MEDAS) was used to determine adherence to the Mediterranean diet [30]. Twelve questions on food items (consumption of food groups and frequency by using raw data, mean daily intake of animal fat and vegetable oil) and additional 2 questions on characteristic food habits of the Mediterranean diet were included (Table 2). The Mediterranean Adherence Score (MEDAS) score could be assessed for 9020 participants and ranged from 0 to 14 points, with items scoring either 0 (condition not met) or 1 (adherent). A score from 0 to 4 was classified as low adherence, from 5 to 9 as medium adherence, and from 10 to 14 as high adherence.  2.6.",feeab689-c0e5-4035-8a90-f3d671cfc4cb
4,methods4," Assessment of Dental Variables  The 6209 participants received a full dental examination (excluding wisdom teeth). Study nurses were trained and regularly calibrated. Calibration took place every two months and was performed by a trained dentist. Prior to oral examination, all participants were asked to undergo a necessary endocarditis prophylaxis. Oral examination included: probing depth (mm), gingival recession (mm), bleeding on probing (bleeding on probing (BOP)) (6 sites per tooth; PCP-12 probe), and determination of the plaque index (4 sites per tooth). Subsequently, two secondary variables were calculated, i.e., DMFT (decayed, missing, filled teeth) and CAL (clinical attachment loss). All participants were then categorized in one out of three severity levels of periodontitis [31]: (1) no periodontitis/mild periodontitis, (2) moderate periodontitis, and (3) severe periodontitis.  2.7.",6e6e6e04-073c-4c00-90ef-5d5e56e9f47d
5,methods5," Assessment of Additional Variables  For all participants, the following information was retrieved from the Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) Database: gender, age (years), education (according to ISCED [32]), cardiovascular risk factors, i.e., BMI (in kg/m2), smoking (ever/non-smoking), diabetes (positive self-declaration and/or taking medication of the A10 group (insulin and analogues), and/or fasting glucose >126 mg/dL, not fasting glucose >200 mg/dL), and hypertension. High-sensitivity interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) were assessed via established ELISA. Nutrition was reported as gram/day and included fiber, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and alcohol. Participants were asked about their physical activity level and hours of sport/week.  2.8. Statistical Analysis  Descriptive analyses were stratified by periodontitis severity (and by gender in supplementary Tables S1–S3).",46434c5b-f5ea-4969-ad9e-905831ecce24
6,methods6," Continuous variables are displayed as median and interquartile range [median (IQR)]. Consequently, categorical variables are displayed as absolute numbers and percentages [n (%)]. Differences within groups were tested using the Chi-squared test for categorical variables and the Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous variables. Dietary patterns were categorized into terciles, resulting in three groups: “Low”, “Medium”, and “High”. Ordinal logistic regression models were applied to determine the association between periodontitis (dependent variable) and dietary patterns (independent variable). Simplified logistic regression model is presented in supplementary material (supplementary Tables S4 and S5). Dietary patters were categorized using a numerical range. All statistical analyses were performed in R Studio Version 4.0.3 (Free Software Foundation’s GNU project) with standard 0.05 statistical significance.  3.

7,methods7," Descriptive Statistics Stratified According to Periodontitis Severity  Data from 6209 participants with fully completed periodontal examination were included. Participants with severe periodontitis were more likely men (60.9 vs. 39,6%), of higher age (66 vs. 59 years), with less frequent higher education (39.8 vs. 47.6 %) when compared to participants with none/mild periodontitis. Participants with severe periodontitis presented higher BMI values (26.4 vs. 25.5 kg/m2), were current smokers (25.1 vs. 16.2%), had more often diabetes (11.3 vs. 6.2 %), suffered from hypertension (72.5 vs. 54.8%), and differed in their C reactive protein (CRP) values (0.10 vs. 0.13 mg/l). Participants with severe periodontitis consumed (g/day) more proteins (72.64 vs. 69.20), more fat (91.41 vs. 86.81), more carbohydrates (198.21 vs. 195.19), and more alcohol (10.44 vs. 9.33) when compared to participants with none/mild periodontitis.",dca07fcd-8490-45fe-82c6-6c45288c7eef
8,methods8," Participants with severe periodontitis presented higher bleeding on probing (BOP) Indices (21.05 vs. 2.08) and plaque indices (22.00 vs. 0.00) (Table 3).  Participants with low adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet presented higher bleeding on probing (BOP) Indices (8.70 vs. 7.14) and higher plaque indices (10.71 vs. 6.25) and were more affected by severe periodontitis (21.3 vs. 13.3%) when compared to participants with high adherence (Table 4).  We could detect a similar trend in participants with low adherence to the Mediterranean diet, with higher plaque index (10.42 vs. 3.57) and, overall, more cases with severe periodontitis (20.4 vs. 18.8%) when compared with participants with high adherence to the diet (Table 5).  3.2. Regression Analyses  Ordinal regression analyses revealed significant association between higher adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and lower odds to present periodontitis in an unadjusted model (OR: 0.",c1ce2577-bcbe-4c79-86a6-88b0f44ae3d2
9,methods10," Participants with poor adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and Mediterranean diet more often presented insufficient oral hygiene (higher bleeding on probing (BOP) and plaque index) when compared to participants with high adherence to these diets. This trend was also perceptible in regression analyses: a higher adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet as well as to the Mediterranean diet was significantly associated with lower odds to present periodontitis.  A recently published cross-sectional study included rather young (mean age = 20.2 years) and healthy Moroccan individuals, with only 71 (6.6%) participants presenting periodontitis [23].",6e4cab1b-6552-4892-9e07-dd3b0d9cb5c5
10,methods11," Logistic regression revealed no significant association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and periodontitis, though the lack of a significant association might be because of (1) the small number of diseased participants and (2) the fact that the study population only consisted of undergraduate university students, who probably present overall better health and oral health literacy.  Nielsen et al. analyzed data of 6052 adults participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2011–2012) to investigate dietary fiber intake and periodontal disease prevalence [22]. The periodontal cohort was quite comparable to our cohort, with approximately 50% of female participants over 50 years of age and a majority of non-Hispanic white, who never smoked and graduated from college.",d8022296-3ac8-4fc4-acd6-b8e5e42cd10c
11,methods12," Although the authors chose not to include the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or the Mediterranean diet specifically, they included fiber consumption, whole-grain consumption, and fruit and vegetable consumption. The authors reported a significant association between a low fiber consumption and moderate to severe periodontitis (referenced as mild–no periodontitis) compared with the association of periodontitis with a high fiber intake (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.69).  The current case–control study design cannot address causality. Thus, the impact of the participants’ adherence to a diet can directly affect periodontitis via quite complex biological mechanisms (reviewed in detail [33]). In brief, carbohydrates can alter the microbial diversity and directly affect periodontal ligament cells. Saturated fatty acids are suspected to increase oxidative stress and thereby promote periodontal damage.",046f6677-eba7-4aba-ae66-018655811478
12,methods13,"  However, participants’ adherence to a diet can also just act as confounding mediating factor. For example, behavioral patterns modify the association between dietary patterns and periodontitis. In fact, (1) women of all ages, unfortunately, are more often concerned about weight control and dieting, eating especially lower fat and lower sugar foods, as well as increasing the intake of fruits and vegetables [34], (2) men present lower health literacy, meaning lower understanding and application of health information for healthcare and disease prevention [35]. Consequently, it is possible that the significant association between lower adherence to dietary approaches and severe periodontitis is solely because of the accumulation of poor (oral) healthcare choices.  Moreover, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diets were selected as examples of healthy plant-based diets recommended by international (AHA) and European guidelines (European guidelines (EAS)).",a31972cd-ea28-491a-a372-12561973042c
13,methods14," However, the two scores were not specifically developed for the Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) study population. Therefore, the two dietary patterns may not fully reflect the specific dietary behaviors of the target population, although we observed a clear trend across all groups.”  5. Limitation  The population of the Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) cohort is middle-aged white Caucasian, and our findings cannot be generalized to other ethnicities or to a much younger population. For periodontal classification, we used the reported gold standard: the AAP/CDC case definition for epidemiologic surveillance [31]. However, during the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions, a new classification, “Staging and Grading”, was introduced [36]. Yet, this classification is not routinely used for epidemiological approaches. Thus, we set higher priority for the comparability of our study results.",7dd1bebd-a8d3-4dba-8f1e-155bd7175b21
14,methods15," Lastly, the sample size of participants with severe periodontitis and high adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet was small (<1%), which can be improved by, for example, purposeful over-sampling.  6. Conclusions  The current cross-sectional study identified a significant association between higher adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diets and lower odds to be affected by periodontal diseases. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate to which extent macro- and micronutrition can affect periodontitis initiation/progression.
