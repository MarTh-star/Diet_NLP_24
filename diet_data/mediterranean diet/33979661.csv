0,methods0," Participants  This study utilized baseline data from the Memory and Attention Supplement Trial (Memory and Attention Supplement Trial (MAST)) cohort. The Memory and Attention Supplement Trial (MAST) RCT assessed the effects of a 12-week intervention of B vitamin-rich supplement on cognition and mood in healthy middle-aged adults (the results of the intervention will be published elsewhere). Data were collected at the Centre of Human Psychopharmacology at Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia. All participants provided written informed consent to participate. The trial was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at Swinburne University of Technology and was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03482063.",9285bc42-1efc-45d2-992c-e8aebb476e0a
1,methods1," The current article is an exploratory, cross-sectional study, using the baseline data from this clinical trial (n = 141), focusing on the relationship between different dietary patterns, cardio-metabolic risk factors, and cognitive performance before participants receiving the intervention (Figure 1).  FIGURE 1 Flowchart of participants included in the study and schedule of assessments used in this study.  All participants were recruited from the community using a combination of online advertising and posters. Participants were aged between 40 and 65 years. To recruit people with a range of diet quality, targeted advertising was used to recruit 50% of participants with an “optimal” diet and 50% of participants with a “suboptimal” diet. To achieve this goal, the diet quality of the participants was assessed before enrolment using the Diet Screening Tool (25).",a3c6e447-d84d-44f0-9b92-0a38d24ea21f
2,methods2," Participants scoring ≤ 59 were classified as having a “suboptimal” diet, whereas those scoring ≥ 60 were classified as an “optimal” (in this study, diet quality was used in the recruitment process, and more detailed dietary assessments were used in the current analyses). To be eligible to participate, participants needed to be free from any neurological conditions, cognitive impairment (MMSE score ≥ 25), and psychiatric disorders including depression (BDI < 20) and anxiety. Participants also had to be non smokers and free from any health conditions that would affect the absorption of food or significantly impact their cognitive performance (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, history of stroke, epilepsy, serious head trauma). Female participants were not able to participate if they were pregnant or lactating. Furthermore, participants were excluded if they were color blind or if they had uncontrolled hypertension (systolic > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic > 100 mmHg at rest).",9826e7ed-c71e-400a-9159-bacf631ae4aa
3,methods3," Participants were not permitted to take any medications, illicit drugs, or supplements that would impact their cognitive functioning for 4 weeks before testing.  Cognitive Measures  Participants completed the Swinburne University Computerized Cognitive Assessment Battery (Swinburne University Computerized Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB)) (26). The battery was designed to assess cognitive performance and be sensitive to the changes associated with aging. It consists of eight tasks; Simple Reaction Time, Choice Reaction Time, Immediate/Delayed Recognition, Stroop Color–Word, Spatial Working Memory, and Contextual Memory (described in the following sections). Participants completed a short practice round before each task, all responses were recorded with a hand-held button box. Accuracy (% correct) and response time (ms) were calculated for each task. A performance measure was computed (accuracy/response time), to account for the speed-accuracy trade-off (27).",6e50f1f2-7abb-4bc5-a9d6-f636a6583d9e
4,methods4," A higher performance score indicates better cognitive performance on that task.  Simple Reaction Time  Participants were presented with the target of a single white square in the center of the screen. They were required to respond with a right button press with the appearance of the target, as quickly and as accurately as possible. There was a total of 30 targets, to avoid anticipation effects the targets were presented with a randomized inter-stimulus interval (inter stimulus interval (ISI)).  Choice Reaction Time  Participants were presented with either a blue triangle or red square. They needed to respond to the appearance of these shapes with a left (blue) or right (red) button press as quickly and as accurately as possible. Participants completed 20 trials.  Immediate/Delayed Recognition  Participants were shown a series of 40 abstract images, they were told to study these images. Each image was presented in the center of the screen for 3 s with no inter stimulus interval (ISI).",c79435f7-d6e5-4937-9f0c-732105d35498
5,methods5," Once presented, a second series of 40 images were displayed including 20 from the original set and 20 that were new. Participants had to indicate if they recognized the image with a right (yes) or a left (no) button press. This task was then repeated at the end of the test battery, the remaining 20 images were presented with another 20 new images to assess delayed recognition.  Stroop Color–Word  Participants completed a congruent and incongruent Stroop task. There were four color words randomly presented to participants (blue, red, green, and yellow), these words were presented in either the congruent or incongruent color ink. Participants were asked to press the corresponding color button that matched the color of the ink, the words were presented in. These tasks were participant paced, once the participant selected an answer with a button press the next stimulus was presented.",adea6f29-fd41-4c42-b0b1-4c066664f9a0
6,methods6,"  Spatial Working Memory  Participants were presented with a 4 × 4 grid, six grid position containing white squares for 3 s. Participants were then presented with a blank grid, and four white squares were sequentially presented on the grid, participants were asked to respond with a yes or no button press to indicate if the square matched a position that was presented in the original pattern of white squares. There were a total of 14 trials, each trial was separated with a blank screen for 2 s. For each trial, two out of the four locations of white squares corresponded to the original grid position presented and two did not.  Contextual Memory  Participants were shown a series of 20 images of everyday objects, these were presented at either the top, bottom left, or right of the screen with no inter stimulus interval (ISI). Once all presented the same, images were then presented in the center of the screen.",f16fe9f2-d4b2-444f-8964-d1dcd2e016d9
7,methods7," Participants had to indicate the original location of the image with either a top, bottom, left, or right button press. As participants had to recall the spatial context of the image, this task assessed episodic memory.  Cognitive Domain Calculations  Performances on these eight tasks were combined into four cognitive domains (27). This was conducted to reduce the risk of Type I error. The four domains were Reaction and Decision Speed, Visual Processing, Spatial Working Memory, and Stroop Processing. These domains were computed using the method described by Kennedy et al. (27) whereby performance scores on each task were converted to Z scores to ensure each task contributed equal weight to their respective cognitive domain. Reaction and Decision Speed was calculated from an average of the performance on Simple Reaction Time and the Choice Reaction Time tasks.",beb06f48-0ce4-40be-9092-c9b2631a6e00
8,methods8," Visual Processing was derived from the average performance on the Immediate Recognition, Delayed Recognition, and Contextual Memory tasks. Spatial Working Memory was the average performance across the 14 Spatial Working Memory trials. Finally, Stroop Processing was calculated from the difference between performance on the Incongruent and Congruent Stroop tasks, this was a measure of inhibitory control.  Dietary Assessment  Dietary data were collected using the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24). Participants were required to enter all the food, drinks, and dietary supplements they consumed for 24-h, the assessment tool asks detailed questions about food form, preparation, portion size, and any additions to meals; this allows the food codes to be assigned to each item reported.",4e6b2c8d-2729-4a7f-9212-f354cff03196
9,methods9," The food and portion size options included in the recall were guided by the Australian Food, Supplement and Nutrient Database (and Nutrient Database (AUSNUT)) 2011-13 and data from the 2011–2013 Australian Health Survey. Nutrient intakes were calculated from the nutrient composition data from and Nutrient Database (AUSNUT) food and measure codes. Participants completed two diet recalls before their first testing session, an additional two recalls were completed in the 12 weeks after the first testing session. All available recalls (minimum of two and maximum of four) were used to calculate adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean–dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND), and Mediterranean dietary patterns as this is more representative of habitual dietary intake (28). Participants who only completed two recalls (n = 21) and three recalls (n = 13) were also included in the analysis.",1271ebb5-453f-4d8f-9231-87fefff14a1a
10,methods10," Macronutrient content was compared between those with only two/three recalls to those with four and there was no significant difference in macros for energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate consumption [t(106) = 0.53, p = 0.599; t(106) = −0.15, p = 884; t(106) = 0.35, p = 0.726; t(106) = −0.12, p = 0.902, respectively]. Therefore, participants with two or three recalls were also included in the analysis. In addition, sensitivity analysis was also conducted, removing participants with only two recalls and reported in the results for any significant findings. All dietary data were extracted from the ASA24, the and Nutrient Database (AUSNUT) 2011–2013 food items extract ranged from two to eight code items. Of these food items, those classified as mixed dishes were disaggregated using the and Nutrient Database (AUSNUT) 2011–2013 Food Recipe File. All dietary scoring was conducted by two researchers SG and LA.",5ce9f546-e5e3-4bf8-9c47-737a78e3328e

Mediterranean Diet  The Mediterranean diet is a traditional dietary pattern commonly consumed by people living in the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.",9e8d2c29-0528-4086-b28c-f79cc9a635f0
13,methods14," It is high in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains; there is a moderate intake of oily fish and red wine; while having low consumption of red meat and processed foods, and olive oil is the main source of fat (29). To assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the 14-Item Mediterranean Diet Assessment Tool was used (30). Typically used in face-to-face assessments, the 14 items were scored after assessment using the data from the 24-h diet recalls. There is a total score of 14, with a higher number meaning greater adherence to the dietary pattern.  dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) Diet  The Dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)) diet was developed to help treat hypertension. It is high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains (31). Adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet was scored in accordance with the methods reported by Folsom et al. (31).",c2c0a514-6c61-432a-80ad-631b64dd5b23

Mediterranean–dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) Diet  The Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (Mediterranean–dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND)) diet was created using evidence for the most neuroprotective components of both the Mediterranean diet and the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet. The Mediterranean–dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) has an emphasis on natural plant-based foods with limited intake of meat and food high in saturated fat. It also specifically highlights the consumption of berries and green leafy vegetables (32).",7fe3af13-3650-400d-9337-56818e226978

There is a total score of 15, with a higher number meaning greater adherence to the dietary pattern.  Cardio-Metabolic Risk Assessment  Cardiovascular Health Measures  Peripheral blood pressure was assessed using the SphygmoCor device (Model XCEL; AtCor Medical). For each participant, blood pressure was taken in the supine position from the left arm, with participants rested for 5 min before measurement. During this rest period, participants were instructed to relax and not talk as this may affect the reading. Blood pressure was assessed by taking three brachial pressure cuff assessments, the first recording was discarded, and the average was made using the second and third recordings.",68c425e7-4c42-4396-b67e-93b1dd65a5df
16,methods17," The brachial waveform was also analyzed using Pulse Wave Analysis (Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA)), providing a non-invasive central blood pressure measurement with scores reported for central aortic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure (PP), augmentation pressure (AP), and augmentation index (AIx). PP is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure.  The gold standard measurement of arterial stiffness is assessed as carotid–femoral-pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV). This was taken using the SphygmoCor device. Cf-PWV was calculated using a femoral cuff. This cuff measures the pressure pulse waveform from the femoral artery. While the participant is supine, the cuff was inflated to measure the pulse pressure waveform from the femoral artery, the research assistant concurrently measured the carotid waveform using a pressure tonometer probe (placed on the participant’s neck/carotid pulse).",130e8c68-d613-4672-9e5d-bd767df30508
17,methods18," The distance between the two points (carotid and femoral) was measured to estimate the speed of the pressure pulse. cf-PWV is a well-validated method and is considered the gold standard for non-invasive arterial stiffness assessment (34). For each participant, two cf-PWV recordings were made, the recordings were then reviewed by SG and the recording with the lowest standard deviation was selected for analysis. For participants with two cf-PWV recordings with the same standard deviation, the score was averaged.  Blood Biomarkers  Biomarkers for lipids and glucose were assessed at the same visit as cardiovascular and cognitive assessments. Participants were required to come to the testing session fasted from 10 p.m. the night before. All blood samples were collected by a research nurse or venipuncture technician at the Centre for Human Psychopharmacology. The sample was collected into a serum separator tube (8.",8800bff7-ad41-4fb9-8e1f-dc7c5887bcad

The sample was then couriered to Australian Clinical Labs where they were analyzed for full lipids and glucose.  Anthropomorphic Measures  Waist and hip circumferences were measured in accordance with the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK)) standards using anthropometric tape to the nearest 0.1 cm. BMI (weight in kilograms/height in m2) was computed from measured height and weight. Both height and weight were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 kg, respectively.  Metabolic Syndrome Severity Score  To assess the cardio-metabolic risk factor severity, the metabolic syndrome severity score (MetSSS) was used (35). The MetSSS is a standardized formula that calculates the overall risk or severity of cardio-metabolic syndrome.",bb49057c-c698-4b5e-aac3-184c788677bb
19,methods20," It uses the following measures to assess risk: waist circumference (cm), triglycerides (mmol/L), HDL cholesterol (mmol/L), Systolic BP (mmHg), diastolic BP (mmHg), and blood glucose (mmol/L).  Statistical Analysis  All statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). For demographic and sample characteristic continuous variables were reported using means and standard deviations, while percentages were used to report categorical variables. To screen for outliers, Z scores were calculated for each variable and displayed in histogram form (n = 4 outliers treated as missing). Observations with values greatly disconnected from the data spread were considered outliers and were treated as missing. Accuracy operating below chance for cognitive tasks was recoded as missing and excluded from analysis for that task as this is indicative of not understanding the task (n = 2).",04618485-9fe3-4223-9af7-b006aca28049
20,methods21,"  Cognition and cardio-metabolic variables (MetSSS, PWV, aortic and peripheral blood pressure, pulse pressure, augmentation pressure, augmentation index, glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and waist circumference) were then screened for normality and skewness by checking the skewness statistic (-1.96, 1.96). None of these outcomes were transformed.  The purpose of this statistical analysis was to explore the relationship between different dietary patterns (MedDiet, dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean–dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND)), cardio-metabolic measures, and cognitive outcomes. Initially, Pearson’s correlations between the dietary pattern scores, cardio-metabolic variables, and cognitive domain scores were examined.",b7f051e0-bb79-4eaf-a8bb-cd60ffd7aab6
21,methods22," Following this, separate hierarchical regression analyses were conducted with either dietary scores or cardio-metabolic risk factors (MetSSS and PWV) as the independent variable, with cognitive outcomes entered as the dependent variable while controlling for covariates. Covariates included age (in years), gender, years of education, and energy intake (kJ). Age, gender, and education were chosen as covariates as they are related to cognition and cognitive decline (36, 37). Energy (kJ) was included to account for differences in food intake.  For additional exploratory analysis, the components of the MetSSS and other cardio-vascular (aortic systolic blood pressure, aortic diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, augmentation pressure, augmentation index, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) measures were analyzed for their relationship with cognition in additional hierarchical regression models.",a03493f7-c088-4640-b10b-0c8c9bc397b2
22,methods23," Finally, the relationship between dietary adherence and cardio-metabolic function was explored using hierarchical linear regression controlling for age and gender. As cognition was not an outcome for this analysis, education was not included as a covariate. All statistical significance was set at p < 0.0125 to allow for four cognition outcomes.  In the current study, a post-hoc power analysis was conducted using G*Power 3.1 (38), finding that when using nine variables in a model (four covariates, five independent variables), a 1.25% significance level to allow for four cognition outcomes, an estimated effect size of f2 = 0.15 and power of 0.80, a sample of 149 participants is required.

The significant finding between Mediterranean–dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet adherence and greater Stroop Processing is consistent with past findings. In a recent study that assessed diet quality within the same sample, participants classified as having an “optimal” diet also had better Stoop processing (24). Hosking et al.

However, these findings need to be confirmed in a larger sample with participants who completed a minimum of 3–4 diet recalls. As the sensitivity analysis revealed that this relationship was no longer significant after removing participants with only two recalls (n = 20). Overall, the findings from the current study suggest that greater adherence to the Mediterranean–dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet may be related to better cognitive performance.",da762a53-57c4-4eb9-97cf-1de2f002a88b
33,discussion3,"  Greater adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet was found to predict favorable cardio-metabolic outcomes including lower augmentation index and total cholesterol. This is consistent with literature relating to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, as it was originally designed to reduce hypertension and has been related to improved cardio-metabolic outcomes (31). Furthermore, these cardio-metabolic factors have been found to influence cognitive function and later-life risk of cognitive decline (11, 41). However, in the current study, metabolic risk (MetSSS) was found to be related to increased Spatial Working Memory performance. The relationship between increased metabolic risk and better cognitive performance is unexpected as metabolic syndrome in middle-aged women has been associated with accelerated cognitive decline (20).",15b27c3a-8f1b-4bdc-a635-7ddbdec99882
34,discussion4," Furthermore, a greater number of metabolic syndrome components are related to worse cognitive performance for executive function and memory in middle-aged adults (19). However, after further exploration, the relationship between MetSSS and cognitive performance was found to be driven by waist circumference. While waist circumference has been related to poorer cognition in older women with type 2 diabetes (42), the current study was in middle-aged men and women free from diabetes. Furthermore, in older populations, lower body mass index has been related to increased cognitive decline, demonstrating that increased weight can play a protective role in some populations (43). The findings from this study suggest that in a sample of middle-aged healthy adults, waist circumference and higher metabolic risk may be protective of cognitive decline.",3204c329-610e-4fd4-8293-3b044535a4a1
35,discussion5," Additionally, the longitudinal relationship between MetSSS, waist circumference, and cognitive outcomes needs to be further explored as the findings of the current study may be a by-product of the cross-sectional nature of the analysis. More research is needed to address if higher MetSSS and waist circumference in middle age are related to increased risk of cognitive decline later in life.  Another unexpected finding was the relationship between greater augmentation pressure and better Stroop Processing. As people age, their arteries begin to stiffen and this causes an increase in blood pressure and an increase in the pressure wave reflected to the heart with each heartbeat. Augmentation pressure is a measure of the increase in pressure that the wave reflection adds above systolic pressure (44). While it was predicted that increased blood pressure and arterial stiffness would be related to worse cognitive outcomes (15, 45), they were not related to cognition in the current study.",a2d80710-f641-45aa-acb1-8fdcff98f674
36,discussion6," A possible explanation for the current findings is that most of the participants in the current study had a healthy cardiovascular function and no one had uncontrolled hypertension. Moreover, previous research found that cardiovascular function and blood pressure do not have a linear relationship with cognition (15, 46). Therefore, when blood pressure is controlled, an increase in augmentation pressure may have a positive effect on cognition. However, there is growing evidence that worse cardio-metabolic function in middle age is related to worse cognitive function later in life (15, 20). Therefore, it is important to monitor cardio-metabolic health in middle age to ensure these risk factors are maintained in the healthy range.",dae169b9-6fc5-424a-adf8-b723dd37b335
37,discussion7," Taken in the context of the evidence reported in the literature, the findings of this study suggest that although there may not be a strong relationship between diet, metabolic risk, and cognition concurrently in middle age, these risk factors appear to be important for later life cognition and the development of cognitive decline.  The current study has some limitations that need to be taken into account when interpreting the findings. First, this study is cross-sectional in nature—current dietary intake may not represent habitual dietary intake and this may therefore explain the lack of a significant relationship between the dietary patterns examined and the cognition. Second, although 24 h diet recalls provide detailed dietary information, they are still prone to reporting errors. Biochemical markers of diet quality are more accurate as they take into account what is absorbed into the body and can account for social desirability biases (24, 47).",218f02a6-7b79-400d-ac40-453c65d67d2e
38,discussion8," Finally, many statistical comparisons have been made in this current study, this means that it is vulnerable to Type 1 error, and no corrections for multiple comparisons were made. Therefore, the findings should be interpreted with caution.  While there are several limitations, there are also many strengths. First, there are a limited number of published studies investigating the concurrent relationship between diet and cognition in middle age (5). This study addresses this gap in the literature as the age of participants recruited were healthy middle aged (40–65 years). Second, the cognitive outcomes utilized in this study are sensitive to the cognitive domains that decline with age. This is particularly important in a healthy population free from cognitive decline. Finally, another important strength of this study was the recruitment technique used.",473ec760-ea49-4fdf-baea-ec711c22c49f
39,discussion9," By targeting 50% of participants with optimal diets and 50% with “sub optimal” diets, it enabled a broader range of participants to be recruited (although the overall n was relatively low), allowing for greater variability in diet quality than is typical for such studies (24).  Conclusion  The present study examined the relationship between adherence to the MedDiet, dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean–dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet, cardio-metabolic risk, and cognitive performance in middle-aged Australian adults. Only the Mediterranean–dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet was significantly related to cognition (better Stroop Processing). There were, however, significant relationships between adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and cardio-metabolic factors.",a29416a7-a4d2-4ef5-a4ee-0db44d690f9d
40,discussion10," These findings suggest that in a healthy sample of adults, the Mediterranean–dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet, which was developed using nutrition evidence for brain health, may be related to better cognitive performance. However, the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet was favorably related to cardio-metabolic risk factors and therefore may have an indirect impact on cognition later in life. Unexpectedly, MetSSS and waist circumference were found to be related to greater Spatial Working Memory performance, and augmentation pressure was related to better Stroop Processing. These findings suggest that the relationship between cardio-metabolic risk and cognition may not be linear. Overall, the current literature suggests that diet in middle age may be important for cognition and cardio-metabolic health.",4a01c914-1960-43bc-8a9e-684cfed70c2c
