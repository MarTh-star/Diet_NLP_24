0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Participants  This was a cross-sectional study conducted from April 2015 to November 2020. It was conducted with residents of Buzen, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, a city with a population of about 25,000, who are mainly engaged in agriculture and fishing. All participants were enrolled in the National Health Insurance and the Late-Stage Senior Citizens Health Insurance plans.  2.2. Recruitment and Participants  The Buzen City government sent an invitation by mail to elderly individuals aged 75 years and older based on the population composition rate, as the Late-Stage Senior Citizens Health Insurance Plan in Japan provides coverage for citizens of that age. At the time of the initial invitation in April 2015, the percentage of males and females aged 75 or older was reported to be 35.3% and 64.7%, respectively. A total of 218 age-qualified individuals (34% male, 66% female) gave consent to the invitation and were surveyed by a home visitation.",f68117a3-cd5c-4245-b766-cf6d249ac977
1,methods1," Of those, 186 (36% male, 64% female) were included in the present analysis, after exclusion of individuals with incomplete data, a daily energy intake <300 kcal, or who were bedridden (Figure 1). The present survey was approved by the Ethics Committee of our university (No. 20-31).  2.3. Sample Size Calculation  Sample size was estimated on the basis of a 30% prevalence of falling incidents by elderly individuals previously reported [1] and a relative 20% reduction in the non-faller group. Accordingly, a total of 156 individuals was estimated to achieve 80% power for a two-sided test at a statistical significance level of 5%.  2.4. Dietary Assessment  To assess intake of nutrients and food groups, a brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire (brief type self administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ)) was employed, which has been used in prior epidemiological studies, and confirmed for validity and accuracy by Kobayashi et al. [11].",ed03085d-9a8a-4657-a44f-88acd3085a26
2,methods2," The questionnaire asked respondents to indicate the frequency of consumption of specific foods among 58 food items, including beverages, by selecting from seven possible responses (twice a day or more, once a day, 4–6 times a week, 2–3 times a week, once a week, less than once a week, not eaten). This dietary survey method was designed to obtain information regarding an individual’s habitual intake of nutrients and foods during the past month’s meals [11]. Dietitians provided oral and written instructions on how to complete the brief type self administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ) to the participants or their family members, and requested that they complete the form in advance. On the day of the home visit, a dietitian checked the brief type self administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ) completed by the participant for errors or incompleteness, and also provided nutritional guidance, including food selection and cooking methods, as needed.",39f50d18-d2a9-46ff-98c3-c121f7bad38f
3,methods3," For this study, the intake of each nutrient obtained from the brief type self administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ) results was adjusted for energy using the density method (g/1000 kcal).  2.5. Japanese Modified Mediterranean Diet Score  According to the method reported by Kanauchi et al. [12], a Japanese-adapted MD (jMD) scoring system was used. Briefly, the jMD score was calculated based on the consumption of thirteen components (grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish, dairy products, potatoes, poultry, eggs, red and processed meat, sweets, alcohol, ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids), with a value of 0 or 1 assigned to each of those thirteen components.",6418525c-b4c9-4ab9-89d5-12af11d355ca
4,methods4," One point was given for meeting each of the following consumption criteria; (1) three to seven servings of grains per day, (2) five or more servings of vegetables per day, (3) two or more servings of fruits per day, (4) 30 g or more of legumes per day, (5) 84 g or more of fish per day for men and 66 g or more for women, (6) 1.5–2.5 servings of dairy products per day, (7) potatoes consumed one to three times per week, (8) poultry two to three times per week, (9) eggs two to three times per week, (10) meat or meat products less than three times per week, (11) sweets less than two times per week, (12) 10–30 g of alcohol per day for men and 5–15 g for women, and (13) ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids of 1.5 or greater. Otherwise, a score of zero was assigned. The range of possible total points was from 0 to 13, with a higher score indicating better adherence to the jMD.  2.6.",2575cdf1-eac5-4d19-b2c7-35a4bbaafa57
5,methods5," Outcome Variable, Falling Incident  Incident falls were determined by the use of a short questionnaire. First the question “Have you had any falls over the previous 12 months?”, with a possible answer of “Yes” or “No”, was given. If “Yes” was answered, the subject was asked to report the number of falls. Those with more than two falls during that time were defined as “fallers”, as previous studies have found that single fallers are more similar to non-fallers than recurrent fallers in regard to a range of medical, physical, and psychological risk factors [13,14].  2.7. Body Composition  Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis with an InBody S10 device (InBody Japan, Tokyo, Japan). A tetra-polar eight-point tactile electrode system was also used, according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Measurements were performed with the participant in a lying posture between 2:00 and 4:00 PM, with the immediate postprandial period avoided.",58e8886f-62d3-4d30-8a91-32f40413de37
6,methods6," Skeletal muscle mass (Skeletal muscle mass (SMM)) calculations were performed according to a previously reported method [15]. Briefly, the extremity skeletal muscle mass index (skeletal muscle mass index (SMI)) was determined based on the sum of the upper and lower extremities, then the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) was calculated by dividing the Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) by participant height in square meters (kg/m2).  2.8. Physical Function  A handgrip strength test was performed using a handheld dynamometer (T.K.K.5401, Takei Kiki Company, Niigata, Japan). Measurements were taken twice with each hand. After calculating the average value of each side, the larger value was used. Calf circumference (CC) on both sides was measured using a measuring tape with the largest circumference between the fibula head and outer edge of the lower leg noted.  2.9.",273897d7-abc1-4530-8cdd-e334b488e650
7,methods7," Oral Examination  Assessments of tooth and/or denture conditions were performed by calibrated dentists, as described in our previous report [16].  2.10. Blood Examination  Blood tests were performed using a blood test kit (DEMECAL Leisure, Tokyo, Japan) [17]. Samples were collected from a fingertip and analyzed with a laboratory instrument (Demecal Healthcare Research Center, Yamanashi, Japan). The system provided results for 13 parameters; total protein, albumin, AST, ALT, γ-GTP, total cholesterol, HDL-C, triglycerides, BUN, creatinine, uric acid, glucose, and HbA1c.  2.11. Others  For medical history, information regarding hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, dementia, articular disease, osteoporosis, and depression was obtained by letter from the primary care physician and the National Health Insurance database. Sarcopenia was assessed based on handgrip strength, CC, and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) [15].",2b8a1156-631a-4638-a49c-0721ac5caa6c
8,methods8," The Charlson Comorbidity Index, based on number of diseases noted in medical history records, was also calculated [18]. Information regarding alcohol consumption, smoking habit, and education level was obtained with a self-administered questionnaire.  2.12. Statistical Analyses  For comparisons between the faller and non-faller groups, a t-test was used when normality was observed, and the Mann–Whitney U-test was used when normality was not observed, with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test used to test normality. When the distribution of nutrient intake did not follow a normal distribution, a log transformation was used to bring the analysis closer to a normal distribution. Mean differences between the groups were analyzed with analysis of covariance (analyzed with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)), with covariates fed into the model selected based on previous studies. Risk factors related to falling were classified as internal or external [19].",7b4ae73c-dc13-403d-8c18-59194a43e377
9,methods9," Internal factors included age-related changes, such as muscle weakness, diseases such as arthritis, orthostatic hypotension, Parkinson’s disease, and hemiplegia, as well as medications taken, such as sleeping pills, antihypertensive drugs, and psychotropic drugs. External factors were considered to involve the living environment, such as house/apartment, clothing, and shoes. Other sociodemographic factors, such as educational history and assistive device use, in addition to gender and age, have also been reported to be associated [20]. Thus, the present model was adjusted for age, gender, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), history of articular disease and/or osteoporosis, number of teeth, and educational level. All statistical analysis was executed using the SPSS software package, ver. 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), with a p value < 0.05 considered to indicate significance.  3. Results  3.1. Basic Characteristics of Study Populations  The median age of the 186 subjects was 83.",c598a6d1-89a7-4155-a456-d981cc74584d
10,methods10,"0 years, and there were 67 males and 119 females (36% and 64%, respectively). Table 1 shows the characteristics of the subjects according to falling status. Significant associations were observed in regard to history of articular disease (p = 0.02) and cancer (p = 0.04), while a significant tendency was observed between education level and falls (p = 0.05). No other significant association was found for the other variables.  3.2. JMD Food Intake and Falling  Table 2 shows the intake of each of the 13 food groups in the jMD with relationship to falling. Significant associations were found in regard to the intake of fish, eggs, and potatoes (p = 0.01, 0.03, and 0.04, respectively). All of the foods, except for grains, dairy products, and sweets, tended to be consumed more in the non-faller than faller group.  3.3. Nutrient Intake and Falling  Table 3 shows nutrient intake according to falling incidents.",08738994-13d4-468b-a2ed-a7c33fbd5a5d
11,methods11," Nutrients that still showed a reciprocal action after log transformation were excluded from the results. Significant associations were observed for the intake of protein (p = 0.01), animal protein (p < 0.01), potassium (p = 0.046), magnesium (p = 0.03), zinc (p = 0.02), and cholesterol (p < 0.01). Additionally, marginal associations were observed for iron, phosphorus, and vitamins D, E, and C.  3.4. Logistic Regression Analysis  Table 4 shows the results of logistic regression analysis of the association between the jMD and falling, with falls as the dependent variable. The results were adjusted for gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) (Model 1: [OR] 0.77, 95% [CI] 0.62–0.95, p = 0.016), and further for history of articular disease and osteoporosis (Model 2: [OR] 0.76, [CI] 0.61–0.94, p = 0.013). Model 3 shows the results after adjusting for the other covariates, plus number of teeth and education level ([OR] 0.72, [CI] 0.57–0.91, p = 0.005).",1ec70e63-c176-4727-bfd1-f1404ffbd2c1
12,methods12," The results indicated that a point increase in the jMD score was associated with a 28% decrease in falling risk.  4. Discussion  The results of this cross-sectional study of community-dwelling elderly individuals showed that a reduction in risk of falling was significantly associated with the intake of potassium, magnesium, zinc, and cholesterol, as well as protein, including animal as opposed to plant protein. In addition to use of the jMD as a dietary pattern, which is consistent with findings described in a review by Rizzoli et al. [5], this is the first known study to examine the association of nutrients and dietary patterns with the risk of falling in very old individuals, and also the first such examination conducted with an Asian population.  Dietary patterns have also been reported to be important for reducing fracture risk [5].",308e3dcb-4629-4a5f-9cb3-bad14fb23aaa
13,methods13," Other recent studies regarding the association of the Mediterranean diet (MED) as a dietary pattern with falls include systematic reviews presented by Ballesteros et al. [6] and Malmir et al. [7], both of which suggested that adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) lowered the risk of falling and fracture. Additionally, Ballesteros et al. [6] suggested that the accumulated or synergic impact of several foods, including fish and nuts, as well as vegetable intake, had a more beneficial effect as compared to a single food or nutrient.  The involvement of bioactive components such as polyphenols, carotenoids, and phytosterols has been pointed out as a pathway by which the Mediterranean diet (MED) can influence sarcopenia and osteoporosis [21,22]. Thus, it is plausible that adherence to the jMD may be a factor related to reducing the risk of falling, as shown in the present study.  On the other hand, there are some differences between the results of this and previous investigations.",fd7efbf2-637d-4abc-b0b2-3419440ea5d3
14,methods14," First, the present study found no association between vegetable intake and falling incidents, similar to the subgroup analysis findings presented by Lin et al. [23] of dark- and light-colored vegetables, though the reasons are unknown. Umezawa et al. [24] reported that the diet consumed in rural areas of Japan was characterized by higher intake of home-grown vegetables, as well as those given by neighboring farmers, as compared to such products purchased from a grocery store, likely due to cultural settings where vegetables are more readily available. This may explain why the present study found no significant difference between the faller and non-faller groups. Second, there was no significant association between calcium intake and falling shown in the present findings, while that between vitamin D and falling was only marginally significant.",ddac25ad-828f-4605-9a66-db447e65e556
15,methods15," Many studies have reported that calcium intake is effective for reducing the risk of falls and fractures, though the optimal level of calcium remains to be firmly established. In particular, individuals over 75 years of age have decreased intestinal calcium absorption and the appropriate intake amount varies widely [5]. Lemming et al. [25] examined the associations of combinations of dietary calcium intake and the Mediterranean diet (MED) with the risk of hip fracture, and found that while calcium had some effect, calcium alone was not sufficient for the optimal prevention of a hip fracture.  Nutrients found to be significantly associated with falling incidents included potassium, magnesium and zinc, which have positive effects on bone health, as described previously [26]. According to a recent review [5], magnesium has a role in parathyroid hormone secretion and potassium homeostasis.",8862f7b5-0d42-4da7-a019-135b37a31139
16,methods16," Another report noted that hip bone mineral density was positively correlated with magnesium intake [27]. Also, zinc is an essential nutrient used by various signaling pathways in nearly all cells in the human body, including bone cells. Details regarding the effects of these nutrients are discussed in the following.  Based on the brief type self administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ), the food group from which each nutrient was derived was determined. For example, in the non-faller group, magnesium was found to be obtained from fish in 21.2% and vegetables in 21.8%. In other words, this population obtained magnesium from consuming both fish and vegetables. However, the results shown in Table 2 indicate that it was fish, eggs, and potatoes that were associated with falls, with most of the difference in magnesium consumption thought to be derived from fish. Results obtained the 2019 National Health and Nutrition Survey in Japan [28] indicated that 8.",6ee86491-24f4-4c68-b4cf-77821f58ef4d
17,methods17,"4% of magnesium was obtained from fish and 13.5% from vegetables, indicating that the present subjects consumed a much higher quantity of fish. This was consistent with our expectation based on the geographical location of the study area, which is facing the sea. Zinc is contained in oysters, and other shellfish, as well as meat and eggs. Similar to magnesium, a study using brief type self administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ) found that about 49.2% of zinc consumed by a non-faller was derived from fish, meat, eggs, and dairy products, while 28.6% was from grains, and 8.9% from vegetables. These results may indicate potential reasons why fish and eggs were associated with falling incidents in our study. In present non-fallers, 32.0% of the potassium intake came from vegetables and 14.4% from fish.",da092c03-bd98-42ab-8fcb-14094bdbb19b
18,methods18," Although there was a significant difference in potassium intake between the non-faller and faller groups, vegetables, the main type of food consumed, were not found to be associated with falls for reasons mentioned earlier. Cholesterol and its metabolites have complex functions in osteogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, and bone homeostasis, depending on the form consumed [29]. Thus, the present findings indicate that cholesterol can sometimes be beneficial for bones. In addition, cholesterol is known to be included in large quantity in eggs, fish and shellfish, meat, and dairy products.  Though the differential effects of protein sources on musculoskeletal health remains to be clarified, potato protein supplementation was reported to increase muscle protein synthesis, both at rest and following resistance exercise in healthy young women [30].",fffdced9-3ba9-4ec6-b2b0-2a400bcf97e7
19,methods19," On the other hand, there are few known epidemiological studies that have examined differences between animal and plant proteins, particularly in elderly individuals. The present results indicated a significant association of protein and animal protein intake with falling, while no association was seen with the intake of plant-sourced protein (Table 3). Among the 13 components of the jMD, there was a significant difference for potatoes. In general, the ingestion of animal protein leads to greater muscle mass as compared to plant-sourced protein, though there may not be a large difference between plant and animal proteins, especially among the elderly [10]. In the present results, grain ingestion was the most common (estimated at approximately 70%), while that of potatoes had a low percentage. This may explain why there was no significant difference regarding plant protein between the two groups.",75cee0aa-0d3a-4cc5-8e7e-6aca553120c2
20,methods20," These results suggest that animal proteins have an important role in preventing against falling incidents, even in the elderly. Nevertheless, further studies are needed for confirmation.  The present subgroup analysis showed a gender difference regarding nutrients and fall risk, with a stronger trend in males (data not shown). Epidemiological studies that examined the association of the combined effect of dietary patterns and nutrition with the risk of falling have been limited, and most focused on a single gender. Although the reason for the difference between genders seen in the present results is unclear, the brief type self administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ) mentioned that errors regarding food intake reported may vary between them [31], which might have influenced our results. Another possible reason is that the limited number of subjects did not provide sufficient statistical power. This study targeted community-dwelling individuals and is an ongoing project.",25a772f3-3253-4cb1-a31d-7ce9a40503a4
21,methods21," It is important to provide community-based care, including dietary and nutritional guidance, on a regular basis through health education and information provided to local residents by collaborating with local government agencies to prevent falling incidents.  Important aspects of the present results include the following. First, elderly individuals received focus, which has not been shown in previous studies. Second, the age range of the subjects was narrow and the cohort was homogenous. Furthermore, while associations of food components with the risks of falling and fracture have been examined, few epidemiological studies related to nutrients have been presented. In addition, there have been no studies regarding nutrients and the Mediterranean diet (MED) in Japanese individuals, except for the report by Kanauchi et al. [12].  This study had several limitations. Because of the cross-sectional nature, causality could not be analyzed.",d81be29a-1a62-423e-915e-5f1710e4c8f7
22,methods22," Furthermore, when using the brief type self administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ) to examine nutrient intake in an epidemiological study, multiple surveys are desirable [11], while only a single brief type self administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ) evaluation was used for the present analysis. In addition, some risk factors related to falling could not be investigated, as there was limited information regarding external factors, such as balance limiting activity, hearing impairment, or house structure, such as floors, lighting, and stepping obstacles like stairs. Finally, the enrolled subjects comprised approximately 3% of the elderly population aged 75 years or older in Buzen City; thus, generalizability is considered to be limited. The use of longitudinal cohorts with a larger sample size will be necessary to clarify the present results.  5.",09680f54-28d9-4071-a1a5-0f247d0ab30b
23,methods23," Conclusions  In the present study, the consumption of fish, eggs, and potatoes included in the diet were found to be associated with falling incidents in the elderly. Additionally, protein, especially animal protein, and the nutrients potassium, magnesium, zinc, and cholesterol were also associated with falls. Together, the results suggest that the jMD represents one of the healthiest dietary patterns and is an important factor for the prevention of falling incidents by elderly individuals.
