These trials including a number of different study designs are presented in Table 1.  Nutritional Intake Assessments One of the key elements required to assess the adherence to the MedDiet is to gain an understanding of the volume of food intake and the particular food groups used for assessment. The common approach to achieve this outcome is to have participants complete a food diary (FD) or an assessment of their food consumption through the use of a FFQ at time points as part of the trial protocol. In all of the original research studies that met the selection criteria for this analysis, the participants had completed either an FFQ or an FD. Of the 18 studies identified, 14 utilized an FFQ, 3 utilized an FD, and 1 had a food program.",3a04c3d3-5bb0-42a9-b40b-715effe7871a
15,results12," The total number of categories of foods varied from a limited 20 groups through to 250 different food groups, with data being collected over a range of time frames.  Mediterranean Diet Scores The assessment of the MedDietS has been discussed in the literature since 2003. This initial research identified 150 food groups and placed these into 14 inclusive food groups (26). A sex-specific median calculation was used to determine the baseline value to assess the MedDietS with the 14 inclusive food groups, or nutrients were considered, where some groups were combined to eventually calculate a score ranging from 0 to 9. The sex-specific median allows for a comparative cut off to be made between genders on food consumption (26). Beneficial foods, such as vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, cereals, and fish, were assigned a value of 0, if a person’s consumption was below the median, and a score of 1, if it was above the median.",a3e13a46-d583-4871-a860-5418027ce185
16,results13," With food components considered to be detrimental to health, such as meat, poultry, and dairy, consumption above the median was scored as 0, and intake below the median was scored as 1. For alcohol, a score of 1 was given, provided consumption was within a specified range. When considering fat intake, the ratio of monounsaturated lipids to polyunsaturated lipids was evaluated with a higher ratio being more acceptable and a score of allocated accordingly.  Of the research included in this review, 10 papers referenced the Trichopoulou et al. (26) study to calculate a MedDietS, while 5 created a MedDietS utilizing a mean score. There are three papers that did not produce a MedDietS. When making an assessment of the MedDietS, 6 studies used mean scores, 11 used median scores, and 1 used a regression residual method. Three studies used a direct or total food amount. Although many studies utilized the original method to analyze the data, only four followed the sex-specific median approach.",7f5211aa-92df-476c-ab3d-c2148d7a9c8b
17,results14," These were Articles 1, 3, 4, and 9 in Table 1.  Cognitive Assessments Generally, cognitive assessments utilize the mini–mental state examination (MMSE) (92). Of the 18 original research papers shown in Table 1, 6 utilized this tool in combination with other tests. Another seven studies used cognitive assessments administered as part of neuropsychological test batteries and other scales. These included the East Boston tests of immediate and delayed recall, the clinical dementia rating scale, 6-item screeners, telephone interviews, category fluency, Stroop tests, clock-drawing, and others. All of which were used as paper-based assessments. Two studies used a computer-based assessment for cognition – the computerized mental performance assessment (computerized mental performance assessment (COMPASS)) (74, 90). The cognitive domains that were assessed included measures of attention, working memory, long-term memory, and executive function.",70d47c4f-e713-4c5e-9dcf-aa9cdad82978
18,results15,"  Cognitive Results Due to the heterogeneity of the selected studies that included a variety of experimental designs, cohorts, sampling times, as well as very diverse dietary and cognitive measures, it was not possible to pool data sets (102, 103). Instead, we used the dietary assessment approach as a framework to report the cognitive outcomes from each study and discuss consistencies/inconsistencies more qualitatively.  Of the research that completed their assessment using a mean score to determine their MedDietS (Studies 6, 10, and 11), two found that higher adherence to the MedDiet resulted in slow rate of cognitive decline or improvements in cognition, including memory and immediate and delayed recall.",089ad0d2-afbc-4f4f-8acc-e867650f75eb
19,results16,"  For those studies that used a median score for their MedDietS (Studies 2, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, and 16), three showed that adherence to the MedDiet improved cognitive scores utilizing assessments of recognition memory, delayed recognition memory, or that this diet reduced the rate of cognitive decline utilizing assessments of working memory. In one study (Study 12), no relationship was found between the MedDiet intervention and cognitive decline; however, the authors did suggest that a specific food category, whole grains, merits further investigation with regard to cognition (81).  Four of the studies (Studies 1, 3, 4, and 9) also used a median score (sex-derived) to calculate the MedDietS. These studies analyzed the median score separately for men and women, as was done in the original study by Trichopoulou et al. (26).",1f5cdebd-b362-456f-9788-68774c69ddac
20,results17," In three of these studies (Studies 1, 3, and 4), it was demonstrated that a higher adherence to a MedDiet was associated with a trend to reducing the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (72), as measured using a global assessment and memory cognitive domains.  One study that did not use a mean or median calculation used a regression residual analysis method (Study 15). In this study, it was concluded that greater adherence to a MedDiet was associated with better cognitive function and a strong correlation with improvement in cognitive reserves when using MMSE, relating these outcomes to the cognitive domains of memory and attention (87).  In three studies, the absolute amount of food consumed in each category was used to assess adherence to a MedDiet. All reported high adherence to a MedDiet (Studies 5, 17, and 18).",060a9c5d-40f4-4a1f-a5bb-66b4ce33f207
21,results18," These studies demonstrated that a MedDiet supplemented with olive oil or nuts was associated with improved cognitive function and also that the MedDiet had the potential to enhance aspects of mood and cardiovascular function (74, 90, 91).  Finally, these trials were conducted in countries around the world with positive outcomes demonstrated both within and outside the Mediterranean region. There were six studies reporting positive cognitive outcomes in the USA, one study in France, three in Spain, one study in Sweden, and two in Australia. ",28caa530-fb2d-43a7-a751-9db90f95637e
22,discussion0,"This review has explored the contention that the MedDiet has a long-term positive effect on cognitive function. The results of the dietary pattern, cognitive decline, and dementia reviews also support the proposition that adherence to a MedDiet pattern is associated with less cognitive decline, dementia, or AD [69]. The primary aim of this review was to determine if adherence to a MedDiet produces favorable outcomes in relation to improved cognition or minimization of cognitive decline. Of the 18 research articles examined, 13 demonstrated that higher adherence to a MedDiet was related to either slowing the rate of cognitive decline, minimizing the conversion to AD or improving the cognitive function. Five of the 18 studies did not demonstrate that MedDiet adherence had a protective effect against cognitive decline or did not improve cognition.",6c4080e0-f125-4852-950a-460c13063100
23,discussion1," Irrespective of the study design, the studies that demonstrated improved cognitive outcomes examined the broad cognitive domains of attention, memory, and language. The studies that focused on the cognitive domains of motor or action did not report favorable outcomes when related to MedDiet adherence. The more specific cognitive domains that improved with MedDietS were memory, delayed recognition, executive function, long-term working memory, and visual constructs. These are mainly tests of fluid intelligence that decline with age (7). Interestingly, benefits to cognition afforded by the MedDiet were not exclusively in older individuals. The two studies included that were in younger adults both found improvements in cognition using computerized assessments.",11f6fa55-5d77-4a1f-83d7-e561d84571b0
24,discussion2,"  It is noted that although there are several different designs within the studies examined, including randomized or non-randomized, that were longitudinal or prospective, and that may or may not have been interventional, it was difficult to assess if one or more particular designs reported more favorable outcomes with respect to adherence to a MedDiet and cognitive outcomes. It was also difficult to assess whether or not the calculation of the MedDietS, based on the original analysis of Trichopoulou et al. (26), yielded more favorable cognitive outcomes. More specific approaches utilizing a median, mean, or sex-derived determination of MedDietS were similarly difficult to conclude if one approach was better than the other with respect to cognitive outcomes, given the small number of studies and the mixed approaches for assessing cognition.  Six studies used the MMSE to examine a global measure of cognition.",05ddc126-f048-4c2a-b77a-5780adb78c02
25,discussion3," This measure was used mainly in trials examining cognitive decline and conversion to AD over a longer period of time. This seems reasonable given that the MMSE is a course tool for measuring cognition and is recommended mainly to identify accelerated aging and neurocognitive disorders, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (93). Of the trials that used the MMSE to assess cognitive decline, three of the six trials showed either reduced cognitive decline or reduced conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. MMSE was also used to assess cognitive improvement – three out of six trials showed improvement in relation to adherence to a MedDietS. A higher rate of positive cognitive outcomes may have been realized if a more sensitive cognitive assessment tool was used. The studies that used the MMSE as their primary source of cognitive assessment measured cognitive decline as compared with the computer-based assessments that focused on cognitive improvement.",88b23f9e-4c61-48fc-8eb4-27a743a38b57
26,discussion4," The majority of the studies that used the MMSE also included cognitive assessments that measured memory, attention, language, and mood, such as the computerized mental performance assessment (COMPASS), delayed recall from the Boston memory tests, the telephone interview of cognitive status (telephone interview of cognitive status (TICS)) 10-word list, Stroop tests, verbal fluency measures, lexical semantic memory assessments, and clock-drawing tests. Only two of the trials used a computer-based assessment for cognition, the computerized mental performance assessment (COMPASS), both showing evidence of improved cognitive functioning in a short-term study with a 10-day intervention. The non-computer-based neuropsychological assessments in general showed improved cognition or a reduced cognitive decline in relation to a MedDietS. There were 10 studies using these other neuropsychological assessments with 6 showing cognitive change with regard to a MedDietS.",7981f45e-4987-4c34-96d6-708b51d04860
27,discussion5,"  The studies examined used a range of methods to derive a MedDietS. Some studies used an FD, while others used various FFQ assessments. An FFQ is a way to estimate the food consumed over an extended period 6–12 months. An FD is a more specific and detailed assessment conducted over a number of days to quantify what one actually eats. There is no standardized pattern or agreed types of foods included in these forms of dietary assessments. The foods consumed can be considered specific to a region or country of origin, and the foods vary between studies, as they have been conducted in different countries and geographic areas. Generally, the food intake is recorded as it is relevant to the specific cohort under investigation. The FFQ has been found to be reproducible and have good comparative validity. The FFQ has demonstrated dietary intervention effects to be relatively accurate (94–96).",c4152e55-b97e-4c41-ae6e-13e63001537c
28,discussion6," When converted to different languages, the validity of the FFQ was also reproducible, such as with the Brazilian, Chinese, and Italian populations (97–100).  Across the 18 studies, there was no standardization of the most appropriate FFQ. There was a large variation in the FFQs adopted, and the selection of food groups ranged from 70 to 250 different groups. It is also important to consider portion sizes, as some studies used food frequency alone. It is more appropriate for comparison to include portion size by food groups with respect to gender and ethnicity (101). Portion size needs to be determined based on the norms for the country under investigation and reported in grams per day for equivalence. The adherence to a standardized pattern of a MedDiet as demonstrated in the initial research conducted in 2003, Trichopoulou et al. (26) also needs to be assessed.",5877b749-b58d-46b4-8d00-cde30faffa76
29,discussion7," This original research, which forms the focus of many of the studies conducted to date, used 14 all-inclusive food groups that were evaluated in grams per day, and consequently prospective studies need to adhere to this specific pattern of evaluation to ensure valid comparisons can be made.  To ensure that direct correlations can be made between studies, it would be of value to have a standardized computer-based FFQ that is easy to administer and simple to review. The use of a standardized FFQ that utilizes 14 all-inclusive food groups all evaluated to grams per day, and this would enable more accurate portions of food taken (grams per day) to be evaluated to obtain a MedDietS.  Interestingly, positive cognitive effects were found in countries around the world, including those outside of the Mediterranean region.",4b4c599a-7a50-4f1d-91a5-9acb08e954d6
30,discussion8," Many of these positive studies used an approach where a mean or median is determined for each food category, and adherence for the individual is scored relative to this mean or median. In this way, habitual dietary habits are normalized with respect to the local region. Change over time is assessed relative to baseline scores to assess whether or not greater adherence supports better cognitive health. While this makes it difficult to compare absolute measures of dietary adherence in relation to a more traditional Mediterranean diet (26), it is encouraging that measurable shifts in adherence within a local population are effective in improving cognition or retarding cognitive decline. An important challenge will be to demonstrate a sustainable long-term shift in diet within a population that also confers cognitive benefits.",b0c47017-606c-48c1-b21a-9a8caa196b8a
31,discussion9,"  Conclusion and Future Directions This review has analyzed longitudinal and prospective trials in accordance with the specified criteria to gain an understanding of how a MedDiet may impact cognitive processes. The level of adherence to the MedDiet has subsequently been evaluated against various cognitive domains to ascertain the potential protective nature of this diet pattern with respect to minimizing cognitive decline, improving cognitive decline, or reducing the incidence of conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.  The overall outcome from this review indicates that there is encouraging evidence that a higher adherence to a MedDiet is associated with improving cognition, slowing cognitive decline, or reducing the conversion to AD.  With few studies available to assess benefits of a MedDiet intervention in a healthy older population, it is recommended that further randomized controlled trials need to be conducted.",a512d05d-f812-459a-9974-099dcf7ac12c
32,discussion10," These trials need to include a standard food consumption assessment that can be validated to determine the impact of cognitive changes over time. It is also recommended that future RCTs utilize validated computer-based cognitive batteries that are sensitive to cognitive faculties, which are compromised with age and potentially amenable to interventions, such as a MedDiet. Future studies should also consider the use of blood, cardio, and fecal biomarkers that will allow for mechanisms of action to be evaluated. Biomarkers will provide more direct measures of dietary status and will potentially elucidate important biological changes that relate to brain function and modifiable risk factors.  Further focused research in this area is important due to the expected extensive population aging over the next 20–30 years.",4ca66d3e-f984-4e0a-a81d-55b159876c92
