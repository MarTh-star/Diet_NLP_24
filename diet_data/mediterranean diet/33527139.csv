0,background0," The Mediterranean Diet (MD) is recognized as heart-healthy, but the economic cost associated with this type of diet has scarcely been studied.  The objective of the present study is to explore the cost and adherence of a low-income region population to the MD and its relationship with income. ",c3f658a9-3cb3-4331-891c-22dc4d0de701
1,methods0," A population-based study was carried out on 2,833 subjects between 25 and 79 years of age, 54% women, selected at random from the municipalities of Vegas Altas, La Siberia and La Serena in the province of Badajoz, Extremadura (Spain).  Average monthly cost of each product included in the MD was computed and related to adherence to the MD using the Panagiotakos Index and average disposable income. ",1e33e3b6-3686-41ce-b431-c7050a1568db
2,analysis0," Once the total cost had been calculated, population was segmented by sex, age, educational level and place of residence. A lineal regression analysis was performed using monthly cost as dependent variable and segmentation variables as regressors (p-values are shown by means of the 3000 bootstrap samples).  Finally, the Panagiotakos Adherence Index (Panagiotakos Adherence Index (PAI)) was used to obtain the correlation between monthly cost and adherence to MD. Panagiotakos Adherence Index (PAI) is a score based on 11 components (non-refined cereals, vegetables, fruit, potatoes, legumes, olive oil, fish, red meat, poultry, full fat dairy products and alcohol). Each component is assigned a score from 0 to 5, depending on intake. Products that are not typical of MD (e.g. red meat) are evaluated on an upside down ladder. The total score ranges from 0 to 55 points, where a higher score leads to a higher level of adherence [23].",2c6d6758-7a8f-4d82-be37-4b89f55bed9e
3,analysis1,"  Results of Panagiotakos Adherence Index (PAI) were divided distinguishing 3 adherence groups based on the resulting score: low adherence to MD (Panagiotakos Adherence Index (PAI)< 29.99), medium (Panagiotakos Adherence Index (PAI) between 30 and 33.99) and high (Panagiotakos Adherence Index (PAI) >34). A recent systematic review ranks this index as one of those that provides the most outstanding amount of information and for that reason, it has been selected to assess adherence to MD [24].  The different cost levels associated to the different degrees of adherence to MD were compared using the Pearson´s correlation index as a measure of lineal association and the Kruskal-Wallis test as a non-parametric tool to study the significance of the differences between the levels of adherence. A value of p<0.05 was considered significant.  In order to compare monthly cost with income, data from the Statistical System of Extremadura [25] were used.",bfa76868-5a5a-4476-a53a-b4d226c583f4

No significant differences (p<0.701) were found between different levels of education and the monthly food cost (MFC) (see Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Costs categorized by sex, age, place of residence and level of education  As for adherence to MD, the higher adherence, the higher monthly food cost (MFC). According to Panagiotakos Adherence Index (PAI), monthly food cost (MFC) associated with high adherence was 229.38€, that is, 34.50% and 49.37% higher as compared to medium and low adherence, respectively. The positive values of the Pearson coefficient and the significant differences between the different adherence groups according to the Kruskal-Wallis test support these results.

9,discussion0," The main result is that the average monthly food cost (monthly food cost (MFC)) shows a positive correlation with level of adherence to MD and amounts to 203.63€. In second place, we highlight that monthly food cost (MFC) is higher for men, the cohort aged between 45 and 54 years and those living in urban areas.  This study is the first to relate the cost, level of adherence, and level of income to the MD in the population of Extremadura, which is that of the lowest per capita income in Spain [20].  Costs, economic resources, and adherence to the MD  Despite the significant income differences among Spanish regions, such as Navarra, Cataluña, and Extremadura [20], our estimated monthly food cost (MFC) is coherent with previous research by Fresán et al. [26] and Schröder et al [18]. The former study relied on university student data aged between 27 and 45 years old living in Catalonia (whose average income is 14.",54d551da-36dd-42d7-84cd-ca505d9b069e
10,discussion1,"40% above the Spanish mean [20]) found that the estimated monthly food cost (MFC) was 226€. In the study by Schröder et al [18], which focused on the aged cohort between 25 and 74 years of age living in Navarra (where average income is 18.81% above the Spanish mean [20]), the monthly food cost (MFC) was 220€. Considering that the average levels of income of the regions are very different, it is clear that the economic effort will differ in accordance with the income of each region.  The relationship between economic resources and the level of adherence to a healthy diet is a factor which is not usually considered in daily welfare clinical practice. Various studies [10, 15, 16] have described a higher level of adherence to the healthy pattern of the MD in the population with higher income. Schröder et al. [18] observed that the monthly food cost (MFC) associated with high adherence was 237.60€, while that associated with low adherence was 202.20€.  On the other side, López et al.",fc01e939-6690-4b6e-bbed-a696c33b9ccc
11,discussion2," [27] stressed that a good adherence to the MD involved a higher cost than good adherence to other dietary patterns. In their study they described the eating behaviour of 11,195 participants and concluded that the expenditure of individuals with good adherence to the MD was higher (0.64€ more for each 1000 kcal) as compared to those with the same level of adherence following the “Western food pattern”.  According to a study of 2014 by the Harvard School of Public Health [28], which analysed consumer choices in recent decades, differences in the choice of food between individuals belonging to extreme income deciles are becoming more evident every year. The economic crisis contributed towards the increasingly unhealthy eating habits of the population with lower economic resources. This study also revealed significant differences according to educational attainment. However, this variable was not relevant in our research.",508e7bc8-b986-49ef-a3c0-140236a01cc7
12,discussion3,"  The Moli-Sani study [29], analyzed the relationship between adherence to healthy diet and economic characteristics of the adult population living in Italian region of Molise. The higher income groups showed a positive difference of two points in adherence to the MD, which was also associated with a 15% reduction of the risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD).  So far, the sex perspective has not been considered in most studies that have addressed the cost of diet, especially in the case of adherence to the MD. In our study, the monthly food cost (MFC) of women's diets is 11.84% lower than men's. Underlying reasons may involve lower income level of women [30, 31], differences in dietary patterns, as well as a better use of resources due to the socio-cultural pattern that has determined deeper involvement in household chores.  Neither have we found any information on lower expenses in rural areas; in our opinion this may be due to the lower cost of foods in this milieu.",35525cc7-2954-4e73-bf1b-07df5b398a1f
13,discussion4,"  Finally, the monthly food cost (MFC) is 15.61% lower in the 75-59 age cohort than in the 45-54 age cohort. There is evidence that older cohorts stick more closely to Mediterranean dietary pattern in their meals [32].  A closer look should be taken at all this in suitably designed studies.  Choices in the management of public health  From the perspective of public health policies, our results strengthen the importance of strategies towards the improvement of diet quality, especially, focusing on the lowest socioeconomic groups [33]. These actions should be implemented in two complementary fields. Firstly, consumers should be educated on the nutritional value and cost of food. In this sense the studies of Drewnowski et al. [34] and Goulet et al. [35] confirm the fact that Mediterranean-style foods can be obtained at all price ranges whether in grams or in calories.",68176534-a4fe-41c4-9344-34f716a89695
14,discussion5," The only condition for keeping the Mediterranean diet pattern at a reasonable price is to include more cereals, vegetables, and seasonal fruit. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on communication strategies that disseminate how healthy foods can be selectively purchased within products of different economic value at a lower total cost.  Secondly, there is a controverted debate about the reduction of indirect taxes (VAT) on healthy (e.g. MD) [36, 37], and/or the increase of taxes on unhealthy food (e.g. sugary drinks) [38–40] is being discussed. In this sense, Andreyeva et al [41], highlight the difficulty to carry out a rigorous analysis because changes in the economic scenario (i.e., increase of VAT) could alter price and cross demand elasticities.  Future research should focus on the prediction of the impact of these fiscal policies and in this sense, interdisciplinary work is essential in order to reach a consensus.",13729128-cf34-4928-b8ff-56e6c4fc917e
15,discussion6,"  Limitations  The main limitations faced by this work are twofold. On the one hand, the fact of using consumption data corresponding to the period 2007-2009 and price data for 2019. Secondly, the possibility of extrapolating the results obtained for Extremadura to the national level.  With regard to the first limitation, table A3 in the Appendix shows the average annual cumulative rate of the Consumer Price Index (Consumer Price Index (CPI)) for food, non-alcoholic beverages and alcoholic beverages, as well as the average disposable income in the period 2008-2019. It can be seen that the cumulative average annual growth rate in Badajoz is slightly higher than the growth rate of the aforementioned Consumer Price Index (CPI) components. Therefore, there has been no loss of purchasing power in these components over the period considered, and the dietary data collected in 2007-2009 could be considered representative of the diet in 2019.",6fad6999-a55c-45e6-bbaf-520ddf5ab671
16,discussion7,"  Regarding the second limitation, the extrapolation of the average cost of the MD in the municipalities of Vegas Alta, La Serena and La Siberia to the country as a whole presents some restrictions. Firstly, the average disposable income in Spain was 37.67% (29.79%) higher than in Badajoz in 2008 (2019).  Secondly, the percentage of household expenditure devoted to food is higher in Badajoz (39.20 percentage points in 2008 and 42.27 percentage points in 2019) (see table A4 in the Appendix). However, for the whole country and for Badajoz, there has been a decrease in the share of food in the shopping basket (-13.96 points for Spain and -17.03 points for Badajoz). On the other hand, the average annual accumulated growth rate of average disposable income has been higher in Badajoz (1.376% compared to 0.834%) and also higher than the growth of the three groups of goods considered (food, non-alcoholic beverages and alcoholic beverages) (see Table A4 in the Appendix).",b9b74bdf-eb46-4caa-839c-9e18b51b165f
17,discussion8," These data suggest a process of convergence of average disposable income in Badajoz to the Spanish average income and also a greater similarity with average consumption patterns at the national level.  Conclusions  The monthly food cost (MFC) in a low-income region was positively correlated with the level of adherence to the MD and is similar to other Spanish regions with higher per capita income, which relates higher expenditure to achieve equality of adherence to the MD.  With regard to the measures traditionally proposed (taxes or subsidies), it should be considered an implementation of these, at regional level (in the poorest regions, where access to MD is less affordable in relative terms) for example in the form of income supplements for the lowest levels of income. In any case, further research on the cost-effectiveness of these measures and coordination in fiscal and social policies would be necessary.  The sex deserves a more in-depth analysis.",0dc06ae4-a89b-4e06-94f6-fc414cd0d724
