0,background0,"Infertility is becoming global challenge in both medical and social aspects. Infertile couples were reported to account for 8%~ 12% population of reproductive age and this ratio was deemed to be increasing [1]. Of the large amount of subfertile people, in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (in vitro fertilization (IVF)-ET) is necessary for many to get pregnant. The outcome of in vitro fertilization (IVF) is correlated with a lot of factors including ovarian reserve, sperm quality, endometrial receptivity and mental stress and so on. However, as an important factor to female health, the role of dietary status in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment has been rarely studied.  There is strong evidence indicating that healthy dietary situation may be beneficial to both male and female fertility [2]. It has been reported that light dairy products [3], animal protein [4], carbohydrates [5] and trans unsaturated fats [6] are correlated with ovulatory infertility.",2de96020-a7eb-47c5-adc4-10155e797979
1,background1," Comparing with individual nutrients or food groups intakes, dietary pattern is considered to reflect diet habits better and influence women’s ability to conceive [7]. In a study from the USA [8], women with highest adherence to “fertility diet” (higher consumption of monounsaturated rather than trans fats, vegetable rather than animal protein sources, low carbohydrates, high fat dairy, multivitamins, and iron from plants and supplements) had a lower risk of infertility compared to women with the lowest adherence. Twigt et al. [9] found that increasing adherence to Dutch dietary recommendations in 199 women underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)) treatment increased the chance of ongoing pregnancy. Thus female fertility may be affected by dietary patterns, among which Mediterranean diet (MediDiet) is suspected to be potentially beneficial.",b8d20a1d-5593-48d8-9a14-2df76baefd3d
2,background2,"  MediDiet refers to diet style of European countries on the Mediterranean coast such as Greece, France, Spain and Italy. It is characterized as diet with high intake of cereals, legumes, fruits and nuts, vegetables, fish, and olive oil but a low intake of dairy products, meat and poultry, saturated lipids, and a regularly moderate intake of alcohol [10]. Large amount of literature has proven the benefits of MediDiet to human health, including its effect of decreasing cancer rate and general mortality [11], reducing risk of obesity [12] and diabetes [13]. The update of AHA/ASA recommendations for the prevention of stroke also suggested that MediDiet could anti-hypertension and lowers the stroke risk [14].  As for the role of MediDiet on fertility, a Spanish study [15] enrolling in 2145 women of reproductive age found that the infertile risk of women with the highest quartile of adherence to MediDiet was 44% lower than those with the lowest quartile.",bb35f48f-622b-48f3-9896-e985a11675a3
3,background3," There are only two studies concerning the relationship between MediDiet and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. Vujkovic et al. [16] concluded from 161 infertile couples that MediDiet by couples contribute to in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) success rate. A recent Greece study [7] including 244 non-obese women reported significantly higher in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinical pregnancy rate (50.0% vs 29.1%) and live birth rate (48.8% vs 26.6%) in the highest tertile of the MediDiet score than those in the lowest tertile. Beneficial effects of MediDiet on male semen parameters have also been indicated by many researches [17–19]. However, there are a little literature reporting no relationship between female adherences to MediDiet and fertility [20].  The relationship between MediDiet and human health has been studied by numerous researches while its effect on female fertility remains scantily explored.",c67b4609-2b32-40db-9e07-86d371d8be5c
4,background4, And the only two present studies didn’t tell whether the MediDiet affect in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes through embryos or endometrium. Thus we designed a prospective cohort study with a larger sample size to explore the influence of infertile women’s adherence to MediDiet to embryo yield in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. ,a931f9c4-69db-4106-8988-c78c5cdebb63
5,methods0,"Study population Infertile women seeking in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment in Peking University Shenzhen Hospital in Guangdong, China, from September 2016 to December 2017, were invited to participate in an ongoing prospective cohort study investigating the relationship between maternal Mediterranean dietary pattern and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age ≤ 40 years; (2) body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) ≤30 kg/m2; (3) use antagonist protocol or long protocol for ovarian stimulation; (4) keep dietary habit unchanged in at least recent 12 months. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking University Shenzhen Hospital.

6,methods1,"  Questionnaires and assessment of adherence to MediDiet A food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) was designed by cooperating with specialists from the department of Nutrition in the hospital, according to the characteristics of Mediterranean dietary pattern and food composition table of China, edition 2015. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) included questions about common consumed food groups (69 items regarding consumption of cereals, meat, fish, legumes, fat, fruits, nuts, vegetables, dairy products, eggs and alcoholic beverages). The frequency of food intake was expressed as times per day, times per week or times per month and the consumed amount each time were recorded as grams or milliliters.  When the patient decided to undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was provided to and filled out by every participant to estimate the dietary pattern.",ffc06c4d-8b30-43e5-b75a-e71453b6224c
7,methods2," The adherence to Mediterranean diet was evaluated as previously described [10] with little modification. Briefly, a score of 0 or 1 was assigned to each item of 9 components. A value of 1 was assigned when consumption was at or above the median in 5 components (cereal, legumes, vegetables, fruits and nuts, and fish) or below the median in 2 components (red meat and dairy products), and 0 was scored on the opposite situation. For fat intake, 1 score was assigned when the ratio of unsaturated lipids to saturated lipids was above the median and 0 score was assigned otherwise. There was a component about alcoholic beverage in the previous score system. Since the benefit of moderate alcohol intake to female fertility was challenged by more and more evidence [21], this item was excluded in this study. Finally, a total score range from 0 to 8 was obtained.",bc362aa5-ff45-4254-a8a7-92c8acfeffa6
8,methods3," Women with this score above the median were allocated to higher MediDiet adherence group, and those who with the score below the median were in lower MediDiet adherence group.  in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure and data extracted in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment was administrated to infertile women according to the standard operating procedure of Reproductive Center in the hospital. Ovarian reserve was tested and then protocol for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH)) was decided. Only those received GnRH agonist long protocol would be included. Patients were treated with 1.25 mg of Diphereline (IPSEN PHARMABIOTECH, France) on about day 21 of menstrual cycle. After the serum E2 was lower than 50 pg/ml, 75–225 IU of recombinant human follitropin (GONAL-f, Merck Serono, Switzerland) was administered according to individual response.",138acd33-e260-480a-808d-5621795e3e9b

Oocytes were aspirated 36 h later under the guidance of a B-ultrasound. Insemination method (in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)) was decided according to the quality of sperm. Embryo quality was assessed on 3 days after oocyte retrieval.

Although fertilization rates were similar in the two groups, patients in higher MediDiet adherence group (8.40 ± 5.26) had more embryos available than women with lower MediDiet adherence (7.40 ± 4.71). So far 61women in higher MediDiet adherence group and 106 others in lower MediDiet adherence group had received embryos transferred. Within similar endometrial thickness on embryo transfer day and number of embryos transferred, clinical pregnancy rate and implantation rate were also similar between the two groups. (Table 2).

17,discussion0,"In this prospective cohort study among 700 women about to undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, we assess MediDiet adherence with a professionally designed food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Despite similar baseline characteristics between groups, higher adherence to MediDiet was found to be associated with more embryos available. Although E2 level in HCG day and number of oocytes retrieved seemed to be different between groups, they were not significantly correlated with MediDiet adherence in correlation tests. Clinical pregnancy rate and implantation rate were not affected by MediDiet adherence.  This study, for the first time, report that higher adherence to Mediterranean diet may improve embryo yield, while not increasing in vitro fertilization (IVF) success rate. This is quite different from results of previous studies. To date, only two published articles [7, 16] aimed at exploring the relationship between MediDiet and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes.",475fd4da-9077-4f49-8cc0-324cb1f3f0aa
18,discussion1," Both studies found that greater adherence to MediDiet was associated with higher pregnancy rate in in vitro fertilization (IVF) without improving fertilization rate and embryo yield. These results implied that the increase of in vitro fertilization (IVF) success rate might be attributed to improvement of endometrial receptivity instead of oocyte quality. However, as Vujkovic et al. [16] reported, preconception MediDiet elevated folate concentrations in blood and vitamin B6 level in both blood and follicular fluid. Folate [22, 23] and vitamin B6 [24] are reported to be possibly capable of improving ovarian response and oocyte quality. Furthermore, benefits of MediDiet to endometrial receptivity have not been stated by any study so far. Thus it is not convincible to conclude that MediDiet can improve endometrial receptivity.",9ddf0ca0-60e6-4e1d-beb7-08dca3fa51e3
19,discussion2,"  This leads us to conjecture whether MediDiet enhances female fertility and in vitro fertilization (IVF) success rate by improving ovarian response and oocyte quality. When women have more and better quality oocytes, number of oocytes fertilized will also increase and as a subsequence, more embryos available will be yielded. In addition, the beneficial effect of male MediDiet adherence on semen parameters has been recognized by many published studies [17–19]. So it is substantially reasonable to speculate that the quantity and quality of oocytes may also be improved by high adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern. This may partially explain the result of this study that higher adherence to MediDiet increase number of embryos available.  The mechanism of how MediDiet improves embryo yield remains to be a black box with presently scanty evidence. Some research clues may help to explain it.",fd7efc7c-57d0-4f9e-b5aa-b723dccea037
20,discussion3," Folate level was found to ascend in both blood and follicle fluid samples of infertile women with high adherence to MediDiet [16]. It might increase number of oocyte and embryo by upregulating maturation promoting factor (maturation promoting factor (MPF)) through Mos-MEK-MAPK-RSK pathway [25] or by facilitating DNA methylation of oocyte and embryo [26]. Antioxidation may be another mechanism for the correlation between MediDiet and the improvement of embryo yield. The high intake of vegetables, fruit and whole grains is a character of MediDiet. Thus, this diet pattern is rich in antioxidants, more consumption of which was reported to be associated with easier conception in shorter time in patients with unexplained infertility [27]. Reactive oxygen species is known as an important cause of female infertility [28] and abundant antioxidants from MediDiet pattern may alleviate the oxidative damage on fertility.",7ef398fc-c62f-471d-9b13-65f9bc122344
21,discussion4," Discovery of these intrinsic mechanisms will be the highlight of further study.  However the effects of MediDiet on endometrial receptivity are not supposed to be denied now. MediDiet pattern highlights high intake of vegetable oils, most component of which is linoleic acid. As one of n-6 fatty acid molecules, linoleic acid is a precursor of prostaglandin, which is important in maintaining endometrial receptivity [16]. Hence, it is possible that MediDiet can affect implantation of embryos through regulating endometrial function. To recognize whether MediDiet affect embryos or endometrial receptivity, controlled trials can be designed in oocyte donation cycles.  In this study, clinical outcomes were not different between the two groups despite the improvement of embryo yield by MediDiet. Although number of embryos available was increased (8.40 ± 5.26 vs 7.40 ± 4.71), number of top quality embryos were similar (2.01 ± 2.42 vs 2.01 ± 2.47) between groups.",4982ce5b-7e8f-4691-b7a4-4850e0615ba8
22,discussion5," This study only included fresh embryo transfer cycle to compare clinical outcomes. In most of the cycles 2 best embryos were selected to be transferred. Thus, the implantation rate was not improved. In addition, implantation of embryo needs co-working of embryo and endometrium. However the effect of MediDiet on endometrial receptivity remains unknown. So the clinical outcomes of in vitro fertilization (IVF) may not be significantly improved by MediDiet as well.  The results of this study indicate that Mediterranean dietary pattern may increase embryo yield through improving ovarian response or oocyte quality. During daily work of physicians in department of reproductive medicine, counselling about dietary suggestions is usually required. Comparing with active treatments such medicine and operation, diet modification seems to be more acceptable for infertile couples to enhance the possibility of getting pregnant.",fab3e7c7-b6a9-491d-9baf-7107952e8b31
23,discussion6," Outcomes of in vitro fertilization (IVF) are influenced by many different factors. Besides attaching importance to clinical controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) strategies and laboratory manipulation of gametes and embryos, clinical workers should also pay attention to patients’ diet habits which may have tremendous potential impacts on fertility. However evidence about the relationship between diet and pregnancy is insufficient. The present study provides support for dietary counselling and reveals that diet is possibly associated with female gametes produced in in vitro fertilization (IVF).  This is a prospective study with currently the largest sample size exploring the effect of MediDiet on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes and is the first study to discover the benefits of this diet pattern of improving embryo yield.",ff52adc6-1789-4ebd-a569-db8ec115526c
24,discussion7," However there are some limitations for the study because only Chinese women were included and the nature of questionnaire survey may not reflect real diet situations of participants. The evaluation of MediDiet adherence was modified as deletion of the item of alcohol because the effect of ethanol on fertility has been quite controversial and only 4.9% (34) of 699 women have alcoholic intake. Next we will keep following up clinical outcomes of these patients and further analyze their relationship with MediDiet adherence.  Conclusion In conclusion, this study indicates that higher adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern of infertile women may improve embryo yield in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment cycle. More well-designed studies are needed to verify our result and further validate the effect of Mediterranean diet on female fertility and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes.",b6797ee4-4bbb-4150-b069-3a792e13a02a
