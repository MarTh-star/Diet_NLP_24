0,background0," Acne is a complex and a chronic inflammatory cutaneous disorder involving the pilosebaceous unit and its multifactorial pathogenesis is attributed to multiple factors such as hyperseborrhea, hyperkeratinization of the pilosebaceous duct, colonization of Propionibacterium acnes and perifollicular inflammation [1]. The influence of skin and gut microbioma in acne pathogenesis has also been investigated [2]. Its prevalence varies in overtime and different countries, and different lifestyles may influence it [3, 4]. This skin disorder affects 70–80% of adolescents, persisting into the 20 s and 30 s in roughly 64 and 43% of individuals, respectively [5, 6]. Acne can leave lifelong scars and hyperpigmentations that need to be correctly prevented and treated [7, 8] considering that they impact considerably on patients’ quality of life and emotional health [9].",a3cde2ab-727a-4d23-923c-a8e77f5583b1
1,background1," The lesional pleomorphism is a typical aspect of patients with acne, represented by contemporary different lesions in the same patient, which can be both inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules) and noninflammatory lesions such as comedones. In this context, acne may be present in a wide variety of clinical manifestations depending on the severity of the predominant lesion, number, and type [1]. The abnormal desquamation of sebaceous follicle epithelium (comedogenesis), sebaceous gland hyperplasia with seborrhea, increased bacterial colonization of the follicle (Propionibacterium acnes), and immunological and inflammatory factors, are the most notable pathophysiological factors that influence the development of acne are [10]. The immunochemical pathways linked to the state of inflammation in acne are complex and involves several inflammatory mediators and their target receptors, including cytokines, defensins, peptidases, sebum lipids, and neuropeptides [11].",ee1554ec-f889-4c5f-bd69-cef479abeb7e
2,background2," In particular increased prostaglandin E2 and PPARγ levels can induce sebaceous gland hyperplasia and overshooting sebum production [12]. These sebum changes might induce inflammation leading to acne lesions. In addition, also Propionibacterium acnes has been shown to trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine release [12].  Beyond genetic factors, considered as the main cause in the development of acne, several evidence reported that commonly attribute the acne condition or its exacerbation also to hormonal influences and dietary factors [13, 14]. Despite the scientific literature reporting contradictory result and conclusions on the role of diet in acne, due especially to the numerous limitations of study design, recently some well-designed, controlled, prospective studies have shown the relationship among specific nutrients and clinical severity of acne [13, 15–17].",a5aa019d-d327-4105-a1d1-e9a8c3b74adc
3,background3," Of interest, associations have been reported between cow’s milk intake and consumption of high-glycaemic index foods with presence and longer acne duration [17]. Mediterranean diet (MD) is characterized by high consumption of extra virgin olive oil, fish, vegetables, legumes, whole-grain products, fruits, and nuts. Therefore, MD appears to be a low-glycaemic index diet and for this reason, it could be evaluated as a protective factor against acne development [17]. Of interest, MD as lifestyle, shows several benefits on different clinical inflammatory settings, including psoriasis [18, 19], hidradenitis suppurativa [20], polycystic ovary syndrome [21, 22], breast cancer [23–25], menopause [26, 27], and in all inflammatory and immune processes [28, 29]. MD decreases inflammation and oxidative stress, providing a significant source of antioxidant vitamins [30]. Nevertheless, to date, only few evidence reported the role of the MD on the development or exacerbation of acne [31].",5a870e12-4499-40b7-a0cd-b5a6b7047b7b
4,background4,"  In clinical practice, in addition to the evaluation of eating habits, the assessment of body composition has an important role. It is commonly measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)), a noninvasive, simple, and inexpensive method for the evaluation of body composition. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)-device has a high agreement with Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, the gold standard in the evaluation of body composition [32, 33]. Phase angle (PhA) is a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)-derived measure and that is associated with the inflammatory status in several diseases [34, 35]. In both healthy subjects and individuals with obesity, PhA has been validated as an easy tool to detect the inflammatory process [36–38].",53532c44-3fac-4d96-9393-db9bf5500f40
5,background5," PhA represents an excellent indicator of physical state, and cellular integrity, as well as of the water distribution between the extracellular (extracellular (ECW)) and intracellular water (intracellular water (ICW)) compartments [39, 40]. Of interest, the PhA is an important prognostic index for monitoring the presence and evolution of chronic inflammatory processes [41]. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no studies to date have assessed PhA as a potential inflammatory marker in patients with acne.  Thus, considering the existence of inflammation in patients with acne, and while taking into account the well-known anti-inflammatory effects of MD, we suppose that patients with acne should be more prone to follow an unhealthy nutritional patter, lowly adherent to the MD, which contributes to worsening both inflammation and, consequently, the clinical severity of acne.",f035627a-6d96-4d10-9639-d96ceec7bd8c
6,background6," Furthermore, since several studies demonstrated the role of PhA, as an inflammatory state, we hypothesize to find this association also in patients with acne.  In this context, the main aim of the present study was to evaluate adherence to the MD and the body composition assessed by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) and their association with the presence of acne and its clinical severity in a cohort of treatment-naïve patients with acne as compared with a control group of healthy individuals matched for gender, age, and BMI.

Classification and severity assessment of acne  The dermatologists who evaluated the clinical severity of acne were blinded to the design of the study to prevent biases. Everyone had a complete dermatological examination including the global acne grading system (GAGS), a quantitative scoring system to assess acne severity, first developed by Doshi et al. in 1997 [66].

The regional factors were derived from the consideration of the density of pilosebaceous units and surface area and distribution. The severity was graded as three global acne grading system (GAGS) categories: patients with global acne grading system (GAGS) score 1–18 was defined as mild (where lesions include several noninflammatory comedones with less than inflammatory lesions); moderate global acne grading system (GAGS) score was from 19 to 30 (presence of many comedones, papules, pustules, but no nodules), and severe if global acne grading system (GAGS) score from 31 to 38 (presence of inflammatory nodules in addition to papules and pustules) [66, 67].",1cfe743a-aa01-40e8-8f00-a6d17ffba52f

To date, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating nutritional status in the relationship between body composition and adherence to the MD in a sample of an adult population with acne across global acne grading system (GAGS) categories. Of interest, the most important result of the present study is the negative correlation between PhA and global acne grading system (GAGS) score. In the multiple regression analysis, PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score was the major determinant of anthropometric measurements, Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)-parameters, and adherence to the MD, and PhA was the major determinant of anthropometric measurements and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)-parameters.",7393f2ba-181c-4111-b62a-f32f2f3ce739
44,discussion2," Finally, based on the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the most sensitive and specific cut-offs for the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score and PhA to predict the highest global acne grading system (GAGS) score were ≤ 9 and ≤ 6.1°, respectively. To date, this is the first study reporting the specific cut-offs of adherence to the MD and PhA which predict the clinical severity of acne.  PhA is an electrical parameter obtained directly from the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) that has been used as an indicator of cell membrane function and as a marker of nutritional status in different populations [36]. In detail, whereas high PhA suggest a large number of intact cell membranes [36], low PhA are considered a marker for decreased cell membrane integrity or related to cell death [68]. Cell membrane integrity disarrangements, consequently of tissue injury, are a well-known condition related to the inflammatory status [69].",96f94a5a-3174-45a5-9891-9416ae1cf8d5
45,discussion3," It is interesting to note how, in different clinical settings, including psoriasis [18, 70], hidradenitis suppurativa [20], obesity [71], and polycystic ovary syndrome [21], showed a strong relationship between PhA and inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein [34, 72]. Our results demonstrated that in our group of patients with acne, an inflammatory skin disease, PhA values were significant lower unlike healthy subjects, matched for gender, age, and BMI, known cofactors that influence PhA. This let us to speculate that PhA, a known inflammatory parameter in several skin diseases [20, 70], could represent also a possible biomarker to quantify inflammation in subjects with acne, a chronic inflammation of the folliculo-pilosebaceous unit. Although in our study we have not evaluated specific inflammatory biomarkers, including C-reactive protein, this conclusion remains only speculative.",c81c0d43-0e16-4656-b0a7-d60a289840fb
46,discussion4," Therefore, although our results cannot demonstrate a causal link, they suggest that PhA could be a marker of inflammation in patients with acne and PhA ≤ 6.1° predict the highest global acne grading system (GAGS) score.  Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous units of the skin, with a multifactorial and complex pathogenesis [1]. In a recent review on the role of diet on acne and its response to treatment, Baldwin H. et al., [17] found that in several evidence beyond the role of genetics, acne is considered due primarily to environmental factors and specific foods and dietary patterns have been included as possible triggers. Low-glycaemic index foods can influence the clinical severity of acne due to their positive influence on the reduction of seborrhea and keratinocytes turnover. Several evidence confirm the role of high-glycaemic index foods on the pathogenesis of acne.",ae82d903-5b3f-4a44-867b-fe5ef40783ea
47,discussion5," Hyperinsulinemia caused by the consumption of foods with a high glycemic index, increased insulin-like growth factor 1 levels, with consequent reduction of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 and proliferation of basal keratinocytes thus leading to dysregulation of normal corneocytic apoptosis [73]. The first step in the formation of microcomedone is the acroinfundibular hyperkeratinization [74]. The main foods with a low glycemic index are legumes and fruit [75]. Our data report that acne patients consume fewer weekly servings of fruit and legumes than the non-acne group. Furthermore, the reduced consumption of these two Mediterranean foods were associated with worse clinical acne severity.  Moreover, foods high in omega 3 leading to a lower omega6/omega3 ratio due to their anti-inflammatory action are among the most possible causes of the reduction of the clinical severity of acne [76].",bdb76376-9b6e-4e35-a184-2242be80abf9
48,discussion6," The higher omega6/omega3 ratio, characteristic of Western diet (poor in the consumption of fish, fresh vegetables, and legumes) is considered crucial in all inflammatory states, including [76, 77]. Of interest, in non-industrialized countries, the omega6/omega3 ratio is usually around 2–3:1, in reverse, in industrialized countries, such as USA, this ratio is close to 10:1; this could at least partially explain the difference in acne epidemiology [76, 78]. The main source of omega 3 in our diet is represented by the consumption of fish. Fish consumption has been reported to be associated with the clinical severity of acne [79]. In particular, Rietkerk and Woolf showed that patients with moderate and severe acne consumed fewer portions of fish than those with mild or no acne [80]. Likewise, Di Landro et al. [3], reported that fish consumption was associated with a protective effect on acne risk.",26dcadd7-d50f-4916-9b79-88d67e314f28
49,discussion7," Similar to these studies, our results demonstrated that patients with acne consumed fewer weeks fish servings than controls, and fish intake was negatively associated with the clinical severity of acne. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and the high fiber content in fruits and vegetables, could explain these observed protective effects from the consumption of these Mediterranean foods, which have been reported to lower the insulin-like growth factor 1 levels, thus reducing acne risk [17]. In addition, a high content of hormones active in the milk could act either on insulin levels leading to infundibular hyperkeratinization or that on pilosebaceous follicles (5-α-androstenedione and 5-α-pregnanedione), thus leading to worsening of acne [17, 81]. However, in the relationship between acne with single foods, it should be kept in mind that the diet is a complex combination of foods and nutrients.",dbe851b8-7b5c-4efc-86f9-6db39d0cafdf
50,discussion8," Thus, it is challenging to separate the effect of a single nutrient (eg omega 3, fiber, etc.) or food group (e.g. fish and legumes) from that of others in free-living populations [82], and it would therefore be more correct to evaluate the effects of an entire dietary pattern with respect to a single nutrient or food. In this context, beyond weight loss, a higher adherence to the MD has been reported to have a well-established anti-inflammatory activity, which is mainly due to the high intake of both polyunsaturated fatty acids omega 3 and antioxidants contained in extra-virgin olive oil, vegetables, fruits, and wine [83], and the microbiota-derived production of short chain fatty acids that are induced by dietary fiber [84].  However, only one study evaluated adherence to the MD with the clinical severity of acne [31]. In particular, in 2012, Skroza et al.",cdee43be-2b6d-447d-9679-772e3d97ad70
51,discussion9,", in a community-based case–control study in 93 patients with acne and 200 controls affirmed that the MD score ≥ 6 revealed a protective effect towards acne [31]. This was the first study reporting a protective role of the MD in the pathogenesis of acne.  In our study population, the MD score was evaluated by PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score, which revealed that acne patients followed a dietary regimen farther from the MD than the one followed by healthy controls. Acne patients ate less Mediterranean foods than healthy controls. MD is richer in fruit, vegetables, and integral foods that could be protective for their both inflammatory and antioxidants properties [31]. The catalase and superoxide dismutase levels with increased oxidative stress, playing an important role in the pathogenesis of acne [85]. MD is a well-established health-promoting dietary pattern.",6c7eae99-ca5c-4db7-884e-ed7268e73ebf
52,discussion10," There is evidence that high adherence to the MD is negatively correlated with insulin resistance [86], adiposity [87], inflammation and immune system function [28, 29], gut microbiota [88], and endocrine dysfunction [89], all conditions associated with acne [17]. Although our results cannot demonstrate a causal link, they suggest that high adherence to the MD could be a marker of inflammation in patients with acne and the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score ≤ 9 predicted the highest global acne grading system (GAGS) score. On this basis, it is conceivable that a high adherence to the MD might be considered one of the best nutritional strategies for the management of patients with acne.  Some limitations should be reported in the present study. First, being a cross-sectional study, the cause-effect association between PhA, PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score and clinical severity of acne cannot be determined.",d9f67366-dcdf-477d-8110-eaf3e341a2a1
53,discussion11," Likewise, the design of this study did not draw a final conclusion on the prognostic value of PhA and degree of adherence to the MD in the prediction of clinical severity of acne.  Second, the possible underlying inflammatory linking PhA and PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score with the clinical severity of acne should be better investigated by measuring serum inflammatory biomarkers, such as c-reactive protein levels and IL-6; thus, our hypothesis of a beneficial effect of both high PhA and high adherence to the MD on the clinical severity of acne remains largely speculative. However, we point out that this was the first study reporting in patients with acne the negative correlation among PhA values and PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score with clinical severity of acne.  Third, the sample size was relatively small.",20ef89b1-7864-491b-a66e-b87847e77f29
54,discussion12," Nevertheless, we have calculated the sample size calculated by the differences of means of PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score in patients with acne and controls, using 95% statistical power. Furthermore, patients and controls shared the same geographical area, being a monocentric study, therefore both groups had likely similar food availability and dietary consumption patterns, and this allowed to improve the homogeneity of the study population.  Fourth, the proposed cut-off points of PhA and PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score for identifying the highest clinical severity of acne should be used with caution until an appropriate cross-validation will be performed and the data of clinical evidence in larger population samples will be made available.",b3f6ce01-3887-43b3-abb7-18e017a3ab3d
55,discussion13,"  A strong point of our research with the aim of minimizing interoperator variability is that only the very same expert nutritionist performed and interpreted Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)-parameters, anthropometric measurements, and PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaires. In addition, the diagnosis of acne that was clinically evaluated by dermatologists and not self-reported.  An additional strong point is that we included only naïve treatment patients and both acne patients and matched controls have been well characterized.  In addition, although we based the statistical analysis and results mostly on raw Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) measurements (as PhA) rather than Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) volumetric parameters, the evaluation of FM, FFM, and body cell mass were not validated by gold standard reference methods, such as dual-X ray absorptiometry.",1b32d742-d7e5-4f01-ac9e-f3fad02caecf
56,discussion14," For this reason, it is essential that expert nutritionists are mandatory for execution and especially for the interpretation of Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) measurements, in particular PhA.  Finally, adherence to the MD has been adequately assessed by the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire, the gold standard among adherence to the MD questionnaires [90]. PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire, less time-demanding of compilation, is less expensive, and requires less collaboration from subjects than other more comprehensive methods, such as the full-length food questionnaire [62]. Of interest, PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire allows one to provide feedback to the subjects immediately after the interview is completed.",3335955c-3818-483f-9138-3ed82a18456d
57,discussion15," Moreover, to minimize any bias related to the filling of the questionnaire and to avoid the interoperator variability, PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire was face-to-face administered and not self-reported.  Conclusion  In summary, in the present cross-sectional, case–control, observational study, we reported for the first time: (i) smaller PhAs and low adherence to the MD in patients with acne compared to the control group matched for gender, age and BMI; (ii) direct associations among PhA and PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score with clinical severity of acne evaluated with global acne grading system (GAGS) score, suggesting the use of both PhA and PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score as a simple and inexpensive markers for both the clinical severity of acne and chronic inflammation.",77934c6c-8b08-4c1e-9a08-8013177a7195
58,discussion16," In addition, these data could support a therapeutic role of the Mediterranean dietary pattern in patients with acne, by contributing to reduce the inflammatory status that paves the way for an increase of clinical severity of acne. As possible translational applications, these results suggest that specific cut-off values for the PhA and PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score, contributing to identify patients with higher clinical severity of acne and could therefore be included as an auxiliary tool in the complex dermatological evaluation of the clinical severity of acne, and identifying those patients who could get an additional benefit from careful dietary interventions.
