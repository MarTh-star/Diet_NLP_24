0,introduction0,"Osteoporosis affects elderly men and women world-wide and is becoming increasingly frequent as people live longer. Non-pharmacologic approaches to bone health improvement include dietary measures, notably adherence to a diet rich in protein, fruits, and vegetables, such as the Mediterranean diet [1]. Olive oil is considered the main fat source in this dietary model and is highly appreciated for its characteristics and nutritive properties. The biological properties of phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) are well documented [2] and are likely to account for its positive effects. These compounds have been found to reduce the risk of coronary disease [3], cancer [4,5], atherosclerosis, and stroke [6], among other diseases.",4f7c0677-c284-4ea8-9a9a-18e531d342d1
1,introduction1," The consumption of olive oil and olive polyphenols has also been found to prevent bone mass loss in animal and cell models, which may be attributable to their induction of a reduction in oxidative stress and inflammation, although published results have not been wholly consistent [7–11]. Our group previously demonstrated that human MG-63 osteosarcoma cell growth and differentiation were induced by extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) [9,12]. The amount of polyphenols varies among extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s depending on the geographic area [13–16], agro-climatic conditions, degree of fruit ripeness, and the oil extraction process itself [11,17–19]. Thus, oil from olives collected at the end of the harvest period was found to have a smaller effect on osteoblast proliferation due to its lesser total phenolic content [20].  Bone is a complex tissue under continuous remodeling, and osteoblasts are the cells responsible for bone formation and regeneration.",adb2ce6a-2ead-449c-b6c5-adaef772cb1f
2,introduction2," They have also been attributed with immunological functions, including the expression of markers associated with antigen-presenting capacity (CD54, CD80, CD86, HLA-DR), allogeneic T-cell stimulation, phagocytic activity, and cytokine synthesis [21–23]. The presence of certain growth factors, such as transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), fibroblast growth factor (FGF-bb), and platelet-derived growth factor (platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)), has been found to decrease the expression of antigen presentation markers in osteoblasts [24]. Olive oil phenolic compounds modulate these parameters on the osteoblast [12], however, it is unknown whether phenolic extracts, which are rich in these compounds, preserve this functional capacity.  The need of studies that clarify the effect of Mediterranean diet on bone health, in order to establish the role of this diet in the prevention of osteoporosis has been addressed by many authors.",b289a503-257d-4ef2-a661-bf5d178ed429
3,introduction3," In addition to being the predominant source of fat in the Mediterranean diet, virgin olive oil is a source of phenolic compounds with biological properties. However, despite the myriad of potential health benefits of olive oil phenolic compounds, there´s no many data published on the possible effects of olive oil phenolic fraction on bone maturation.  Despite of in vitro studies limitations our results provide new knowledge about molecular mechanism of action of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) phenolic extracts on bone cells, which support the epidemiological evidences which suggest that extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) could be useful to enhance bone health and prevent osteoporosis.  The objective of this study was to determine the in vitro effect of the phenolic fraction of different extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) varieties on the differentiation, antigenic expression, and phagocytic activity of osteoblast-like MG-63 cells.",559d34e9-20f9-4f60-acfe-65f308881e8f
4,introduction4," The MG63 cell line is commonly used as an osteoblast model because they share the same characteristics.  Material and methods Olives Olives were hand-picked at the beginning of the harvest from ten 27-year-old olive trees of Picual and Hojiblanca cultivars and ten 16-year-old olive trees of Picual, Arbequina, Picudo, and Hojiblanca cultivars that had been grown, spaced 12 x 12 m2, in the experimental farm of the Agricultural Research Training Centre in Cabra (Córdoba, Southern Spain). The olive ripening index was determined according to the international olive oil council (international olive oil council (IOOC)) and based on the olive skin and pulp color [25]. Only healthy fruits with no kind of infection or physical damage were selected for study.  Oil samples extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples were obtained using an Abencor analyzer (Abengoa S.A.",8dc7f8fb-8dbb-4466-b80a-f3ac4cb069a5
5,introduction5,", Seville, Spain), which reproduces the industrial process at laboratory scale and consists of three basic elements: hammer mill, thermobeater, and pulp centrifuge [26]. The extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples obtained were decanted and stored in amber glass bottles at 4°C in darkness without headspace until analysis.  Sample preparation The phenolic fraction of the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts studied has been previously characterized by García-Martínez et al. (2016) [20]. This fraction was isolated using the method proposed by the international olive oil council (IOOC) [25]. Briefly, this analytical methodology combined olive oil extraction with methanol/water (80/20), ultrasonic bath for 15 min at ambient temperature, and centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 25 min. Next, an aliquot of the supernatant phase was filtered through a 5-mL plastic syringe using a Millex®-HV PVDF 0.45 μm filter (Millipore Corp, Billerica, MA, USA).",fe9e1b1d-426b-4b63-ac69-69b575dfb099

8,introduction8,"  Alkaline phosphatase activity The effect on osteoblast-like cell differentiation was assessed by evaluating the alkaline phosphatase (alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) activity of MG-63 cells cultured for six days in osteogenic medium [28] and then treated with olive oil phenolic extracts at doses of 10-6M for 48 h. alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was quantified using a colorimetric assay (Diagnostic kit 104-LL, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) following Sandrini et al [29]. This assay measures the conversion by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme of the colorless substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate to the yellow product p-nitrophenol, with the color change rate corresponding to the amount of enzyme present in the solution. Standard solutions of p-nitrophenol (0–250 μM) were prepared from dilutions of a 1,000 μM stock solution and assayed in parallel. Cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 1×104 cells/mL per well and cultured in the osteogenic medium under standard conditions for 7 days.",c37ba2f4-09f2-4b27-8d37-4f38eadf862b
9,introduction9," The culture medium was then replaced by a fresh medium, and cells were treated with 10−6 M of the olive oil phenolic extracts under study, followed by their culture for 48 h under standard conditions.

Samples were then centrifuged at 1,500 rpm, and the supernatants were stored at −70°C until their use. alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was determined by using p-nitrophenol phosphate as substrate, adding the cell lysate solution (50 μL) to 50 μL of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) substrate (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and incubating the resulting solution at 37°C for 45 min in darkness. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 0.1 M NaOH, and absorbance was then measured at 405 nm with a spectrophotometer (Biotek EL×800).

16,discussion0,"The main finding of this in vitro study is that phenolic extracts from different extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) varieties can modulate parameters related to osteoblast differentiation.  The expression of CD54, CD80, and HLA-DR on osteoblast-like cells was reduced by treatment with phenolic extracts from every extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) variety studied. Expression of these antigen presentation markers is known to be modified by the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), cytokines, growth factors, platelet-rich plasma, and certain pharmaceuticals, among other substances [24,30,31]. Thus, in vitro treatment with TGF-β1 of human osteoblasts obtained by primary culture from bone samples was found to significantly reduce their expression of CD54 and also CD86, although it had no significant effect on their expression of CD80 or HLA-DR [24].",0d3b610c-cfda-4698-b7fd-a47b8281c923
17,discussion1," In the latter study, the expression of CD54, CD80, CD86, or HLA-DR was not modulated by treatment with FGFb, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, or IL-2 but was significantly increased by treatment with IL-1β, IFNγ, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Ruiz et al [22] also observed that IL1, TNFβ1, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment modified the expression of IL-4, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, and IFNγ on osteoblasts and suggested that their functional capacity is modulated during differentiation and maturation, with a gain in bone-forming function at the expense of their immunological function. The present findings support this proposition, suggesting that phenolic extracts of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s contribute to the bone-forming function of osteoblasts. Variations observed in the effects of extracts from different varieties are consistent with a previous report on their differential impact on cell proliferation [20].",d6e2bad1-238f-4c68-9650-bae6fea9d1d0
18,discussion2," Thus, Arbequina, which produced the greatest reduction in the expression of cell differentiation markers, had shown the lowest effect on proliferative capacity. This is because the proliferative capacity of the cells decreases with increased maturation/differentiation.  Osteoporosis is a dysregulation of bone remodeling in which the bone resorption rate is greater than the bone formation rate, resulting in bone loss [32]. Etiologic factors implicated in this disease include inflammation and oxidative stress [33], while proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, or TNF-α have been found to promote bone resorption by favoring osteoclast formation [34]. In the present study, treatment of osteoblast-like cells with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) phenolic extracts reduced their expression of CD54, CD80, and HLA-DR antigens.",c16b4e98-4e71-4545-a65c-684aecfb3277
19,discussion3," This decrease was not related to the presence of proinflammatory cytokines or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but was associated with the presence of growth factors that promote osteoblast differentiation or maturation [22,24].  All of the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts assayed in vitro produced a major and significant increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, suggesting a favorable effect on the maturation of these osteoblast-like cells. Among the four extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s studied, the greatest increase was observed with Picual, the variety with the highest phenolic compound content [20]. Extracts from the other three varieties also produced significant increases in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity with respect to controls.",2139caf8-281f-41b4-ba38-b000c74012b0
20,discussion4,"  In a murine osteoblast model, Hagiwara et al [10] demonstrated that collagen proliferation and production and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were increased in MC3T3-E1 cells treated with hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and oleuropein, the main phenolic compounds in olive oil. In a study of old ovariectomized rats, Saleh and Saleh [35] found that 12-week treatment with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (1 mL/kg body weight) significantly prevented bone thickness reduction as assessed by histology findings and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and a reduction in their oxidative stress may have played a role.  Phagocytic capacity was observed in a high percentage of MG63 cells but was reported in only 30% of primary cultures of human osteoblasts from bone samples, and this capacity appears to be related to the degree of cell maturation [23,27].",fa37f290-55e0-4c2d-9eee-14834986e1cc
21,discussion5," The phagocytic capacity of MG63 cells was reduced by treatment with the phenolic extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts, supporting their beneficial effect on osteoblast maturation.  Our in vitro data would be related to the results observed in human studies, where it has been described that diets enriched with olive oil increase osteocalcin in serum and the concentrations of P1NP, a bone formation marker [8,36]. However, further investigations are required to have a deeper knowledge about the benefit of phenolic extracts of olive oil in bone tissue.  In conclusion, these findings suggest that phenolic extracts of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) contribute to osteoblast maturation, increasing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and reducing phagocytic capacity and the expression of CD54, CD80, and HLA-DR antigens. Among the four varieties studied, the greatest effects were observed with Picual.  Supporting information S1 Table Data for alkaline phosphatase activity, Fig 1.",70d8c436-5460-4fe8-ae2c-c83220e15932
