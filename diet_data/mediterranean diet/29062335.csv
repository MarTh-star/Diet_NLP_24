Eighty-three patients were enrolled together with healthy volunteers from the hospital and employees from the same geographical area. Controls were matched by age, sex, and Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) and none had a history of cancer, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, liver or renal failure, inflammatory disease, alcohol abuse and none of them consumed medicaments. To avoid the overlapping enrollment, none of the controls contemporarily participated in other trials during the period of this study.",4b9a8ada-387c-4e4a-a8b4-9a6e6dfc8fa2
5,methods5," All the measurements were performed between 8 and 12 AM. All subjects were measured after an overnight fast. The flow chart of the studied subjects is shown in Figure 1.  2.3. Clinicopathological Characteristics of the Tumor Clinicopathological characteristics, such as primary tumor site and size, tumor stage, mitotic rate, ki67 index, metastases, familiar history of MEN1, hormonal secretion, comorbidity, treatment and follow-up, were collected for all patients.  Tumor size (mm) was defined as the maximum tumor diameter in the pathological specimen or in the last computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when the patient had not undergone surgery or when the patient had multiple pancreatic nodules in case of MEN1. For these patients, the diameter of the biggest pancreatic lesion was considered for the tumor size. Only in a few cases (n = 3) was the tumor size not defined since the primary lesion had not been found.",2b8fc702-ce65-442e-8d8b-67ed7158a78a
6,methods6," Tumor stage at diagnosis was classified according to the ENETS criteria [20]. According to this, patients were classified as those with localized disease (stage I–III) and patients with advanced disease (presence of metastases, stage IV).  For the diagnosis of NET, immunohistochemistry for chromogranin A, synaptophysin and ki67 were performed for all formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples deriving from biopsy or surgery of the primary tumor and/or metastases [21]. Particularly, the evaluation of the mitotic rate and ki67% index were performed as previously reported [22] according to ENETS criteria [20]. Additionally, according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification [18], all GEP-NETs were divided into well-differentiated or poorly differentiated malignant neoplasms named neuroendocrine carcinomas (neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC)s).",aeab7a38-f5ad-4319-a5a4-bd69c1f36393
7,methods7," In this study, only patients with well-differentiated/low grade GEP-NETs, graded as G1 (ki67% ≤2% and mitoses <2) or G2 (ki67% 3–20% and mitoses 2–20) were included [18].  At the time of the visit, disease status was defined as “disease free”, when there was no biochemical and morphological evidence of the disease after tumor resection, “stable disease” or “progressive disease” according to RECIST 1.1 criteria [23].  2.4. Lifestyle Habits Lifestyle habits, including physical activity level and smoking habits, were investigated by a standard questionnaire. Physical activity levels were expressed according to whether the participant habitually engaged at least 30 min/day of aerobic exercise (YES/NO). Subjects were considered as “current smokers” when they smoked at least one cigarette per day, “former smokers” when having stopped smoking at least one year before the interview, and “non-current smokers”. Former and non-current smoker were considered as “no-smoker” for the analyses.  2.5.",77d986b1-8307-407e-91dd-2109fbff4e50
8,methods8," Dietary Assessment As widely reported previously [24,25,26,27], data were obtained during a face-to-face interview between the patient and a qualified nutritionist. In detail, the dietary interview enabled the quantification of food and drinks by using a photographic food atlas (≈1000 photographs) of known portion sizes to ensure accurate completion of the records [28]. Dietary data, including beverage intakes and alcohol consumption, were collected by 7-day food records that were evaluated by a nutritionist. Data were stored and processed later, using a specific software (Terapia Alimentare Dietosystem® DS-Medica, (http://www.dsmedica.",bd3039ce-3696-43c5-bc87-8a0f0fe57384

Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet As previously reported [17,24,25,26,29,30,31,32], the adherence to the MD was evaluated using the 14-item questionnaire for the assessment of PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)) [33]. A qualified nutritionist administered the questionnaire during a face-to-face interview to all the enrolled subjects.",126bf239-726b-4208-a949-c456d5c999e5
10,methods10," Briefly, for each item scores 1 and 0 were assigned; the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score was calculated as follows: 0–5, lowest adherence; score 6–9, average adherence; score ≥10, highest adherence [33].  2.7. Anthropometric Measurements and Blood Pressure Anthropometric measurements were obtained with subjects wearing light clothes and without shoes. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated by weight and height (weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2), kg/m2). Height was measured to the nearest 1 cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer (Seca 711; Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Body weight was derived to the nearest 50 g using a calibrated balance beam scale (Seca 711; Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Subjects were classified by Body Mass Index (BMI) according to World Health Organization (WHO)’s criteria as normal weight (Body Mass Index (BMI) 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (Body Mass Index (BMI) 25.0–29.9 kg/m2), grade I obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI) 30.0–34.",e0acf4ad-c07a-479a-864c-1fb9641b3d34

Waist Circumference (WC) was measured to the closest 0.1 cm at the natural indentation or at a midway level between lower edge of the rib cage and iliac crest if no natural indentation was visible using a non-stretchable measuring tape, in line with the National Center for Health Statistics (National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)) [35]. In all individuals systolic (systolic (SBP)) and diastolic (diastolic (DBP)) blood pressure were measured three times, every two min after the subject had been sitting for at least 10 min, with a random sphygmomanometer (Gelman Hawksley Ltd., Sussex, UK). The mean of the second and third reading was recorded.  2.8. Assay Methods Samples were collected in the morning between 8 and 10 a.m., after an overnight fast of at least 8 h and stored at −80 °C until being processed.",26111529-3e25-40f1-9974-d882d2ff0770

Low-density lipoprotein (Low density lipoprotein (LDL)) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) cholesterol were determined by a direct method (homogeneous enzymatic assay for the direct quantitative determination of Low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol).  2.9. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis Bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed using a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) phase-sensitive system by experienced observers (an 800-µA current at a frequency single-frequency of 50 kHz Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) 101 RJL, Akern Bioresearch, Florence—Italy) [36], as already amply reported in previous studies [17,29,37].",43db2758-4ba7-4c1f-8f4e-66c2855cd0b4
13,methods13," Based on the European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN)) guidelines [38], all participants were supine with limbs slightly spread apart from the body, had refrained from eating, drinking, and exercising for six hours with no alcohol within 24 h before testing. Shoes and socks were removed and contact areas were scrubbed with alcohol immediately before electrode placement. Electrodes (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)TRODES Akern Srl; Florence—Italy) were placed on the dorsal surface of the right hand proximal to the phalangeal–metacarpal joint and on the superior surface of the right foot distal to the transverse arch. Sensor electrodes were placed on the right wrist at the midpoint between the distal prominence of the radius and ulna, and on the right ankle between the medial and lateral malleoli, as described by Kushner et al. [39].",5bc680c1-a7b7-4cf9-b0c2-c28dbc2cbd7c
14,methods14," All measurements were performed under strictly standardized conditions by the author, using the same device in order to avoid interobserver and interdevice variability. The instrument was routinely checked with resistors and capacitors of known values. Reliability for within-day and between-day measurements by the same observer were <2.7% for resistance (R), <2.9% for reactance (Xc), and <3.1% for R, <2.4% for Xc, respectively. The coefficient of variation (CV) of repeated measurements of R and Xc at 50 kHz was assessed in 14 patients (7 males and 7 females) by the same observer: CVs were 1.9% for R and 1.8% for Xc. The PhA was derived from conditions under 50 kHz according to the following formula: PhA (°, degrees) = arctangent Xc/R ((Xc/R) × (180/π)).  2.10. Statistical Analysis The data distribution was evaluated by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the abnormal data were normalized by logarithm.",513b0ff5-5c01-47cb-8946-3170feeb3487
15,methods15," All variables were logarithmically transformed and back-transformed for presentation in tables and figures. The chi-square (χ2) test was used to determine the significance of differences in the frequency distribution. Differences between GEP-NETs patients and the control group were analyzed by Student’s paired t-test, while the differences among the several parameters with the disease status were analyzed by Student’s unpaired t-test, followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis. p values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.  Proportional Odds Ratio (OR) models, p-value, 95% Interval Confidence (IC), and R2, were performed to assess the association among quantitative variables (grading system and metastasis).",ce87dd5c-96d5-4433-9165-210d0972cd70
16,methods16," Multinomial logistic regression, χ2, p-value, and Akaike Information Criterion (Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)), were performed to model the relationship between the several parameters with the three groups of disease status (disease free, stable disease, and progressive disease). The correlations between the different variables were performed using Pearson r correlation coefficients. Receiver operator characteristic (Receiver operator characteristic (ROC)) curve analysis was performed to determine sensitivity and specificity, area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)), and IC, as well as cut-off values for PhA and PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score in detecting Sartorius HS score above the median values in the HS patients. Test area under the curve (AUC) for Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was also performed. For α level the 0.05 type I error was selected and for β level the 0.20 type II error was selected.",61547aa4-8c91-45d5-b2d4-165bd47efaba
17,methods17," In these last analyses, only variables with a p-value < 0.05 in the univariate analysis (partial correlation) were entered. Variables with a variance inflation factor (variance inflation factor (VIF)) >10 were excluded to avoid multicollinearity. Values ≤ 5% were considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using the MedCalc® package (Version 12.3.0 1993–2012 MedCalc Software bvba-MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium) and SPSS Software (PASW Version 21.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  3. Results 3.1. Patient Population A total of 83 patients (F:M = 43:40), mean age 56.66 (18–80) years, affected by GEP-NET were included in the study. Mean size of the tumor was 24.96 ± 23.79 mm. Primary NET were located in the pancreas (n = 47, 56.6%), stomach (n = 12, 14.5%), small intestine (n = 14, 16.9%), appendix (n = 5, 6%), colon (n = 2, 2.4%) and in a few cases the primary site was unknown (n = 3, 3.6%). The majority of patients had non-functioning GEP-NET (n = 75, 90.4%).",21c86069-5393-4be0-8289-66e9b3eb0bd3

19,methods19," Nutritional Status in GEP-NET Patients and Control Group Clinical and anthropometric characteristics, lifestyle habits, blood pressure, metabolic profile, and bioelectrical parameters deriving from Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) of GEP-NET patients compared to controls are shown in Table 1. To note, GEP-NET patients smoked less (p = 0.005), presented higher blood pressure values and a worse metabolic profile (p < 0.001), and had smaller PhA according to gender (p < 0.001) in comparison to the control group (Table 1).  Data on Mediterranean food frequencies were analyzed by using the 7-day food records. Even though no differences in energy intake were observed between the two groups, GEP-NET patients consumed a lower quantity of plant protein (p = 0.003), complex carbohydrate (p < 0.001), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (p = 0.009) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (p < 0.001), and higher quantity of simple carbohydrate (p < 0.",0a4e0a84-2282-46ec-b11e-bf4a4bd5118e

Discussion GEP-NET patients have been reported to have an impaired nutritional status (the metabolic state, the dietary pattern and body composition), mostly due to excessive secretion of gastrointestinal hormones and peptides, medical treatment, and surgical procedures [4,40]. Different studies have shown that a poor nutritional status negatively impacts the clinical outcome of patients with NET [6,8,9]. Moreover, metabolic profile has been reported to worsen the severity of non-functioning GEP-NETs being associated to a higher ki67% index and larger tumor size [5].",b7204610-a9b7-4869-a389-86fc1cc2d72a
30,methods30," It has been suggested that nutritional factors, such as the adherence to the MD, could influence the aggressiveness of different tumor types, such as prostate, bladder and breast cancer [12,13,14], and that a low adherence to the MD pattern could correlate with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome [16].  In our study we reported the difference of nutritional status, evaluated by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) and its derived parameter PhA, and dietary pattern between a selected group of GEP-NET patients and healthy control. Moreover, in GEP-NET patients we observed a significant correlation among the nutritional status the adherence to the MD and clinicopathological characteristics, including tumor grade, stage, disease status, ki67% index, and tumor size.",4d2150e5-8a19-4b27-90ca-8a83ef3c6dad
31,methods31,"  In comparison to healthy controls, patients affected by GEP-NET had a dietary pattern characterized by a significantly lower adherence to the MD, as assessed by PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score, consuming less frequently vegetables, fruits, wine, fish/seafood, nuts, and more frequently red/processed meats, butter, cream, margarine, and soda drinks. Moreover, in line with the tumor-preventive potential effect of some food containing specific bioactive compounds (e.g., n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) [41], we observed that GEP-NET patients in comparison to healthy controls, had a lower consumption of unsaturated fat that is beneficial for health, were associated with a lower consumption of plant protein and complex carbohydrates and had a preferential consumption of simple carbohydrate and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).",95c3c4a9-edfc-4fa1-acb5-6dc33c5783b7
32,methods32," As already reported [16], we observed that GEP-NET patients presented a worse metabolic profile probably as a consequence of a low adherence to the MD. Indeed, the metabolic profile of these patients was characterized by an increase of waist circumference, higher blood pressure values, and significantly higher blood levels of fasting glucose, total and Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, and significantly lower levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, all parameters that are associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome. Thus, we confirmed that the worse metabolic parameters correlated with higher ki67% index, as previously reported by our group [5]. However, we did not find significant correlations between these parameters and larger tumor size, except for high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.",0921e839-6926-485a-b20f-38e745415267
33,methods33," These contrasting results with our previous study [5] could be due to the fact that in the present study we did not consider the metabolic syndrome per se, but we focused our attention on the nutritional status and dietary pattern.  We observed that GEP-NET patients presented a decreased PhA value in comparison to healthy controls, as already reported in other diseases, such as infection disease, inflammation status, and several cancer types [11]. It has been suggested that the PhA value correlated with disease severity [11] and that a low value could be predictive of impaired prognosis (mortality, disease progression, postoperative complications) in different tumors, such as pancreatic [42], breast [43], lung [44], and colorectal cancer [45]. Moreover, we recently observed that PhA value correlated with the adherence to MD independently of confounding factors [17].",8210cea1-79fa-4d42-b68b-b81d0e5c43ec
34,methods34," In parallel with these findings, we demonstrated that a decreased PhA, together with a lower adherence to the MD as assessed by a low PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score, were the major predictors of GEP-NET aggressiveness. The Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that tumor grading G2 was well predicted by a PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score ≤ 5 and a PhA value ≤ 4.7° with a sensitivity of 80% and 94.3% and a specificity of 95.8% and 81.2%, respectively. Thus, we concluded that a lower adherence to the MD, together with a decreased PhA value and a consequent worse metabolic profile, were associated with an increased GEP-NET aggressiveness, characterized by tumor grading G2, stage IV and progressive disease, also after adjustments for gender, smoking, and physical activity.  However, there are some limits of this study that should be considered.",a5280c79-5908-434d-a8f4-eb3c2e6c4ac4
35,methods35," The cross-sectional nature of the study did not allow any causal association to be identified between MD or PhA and GEP-NETs and to clearly determine the prognostic value of the adherence to the MD or of PhA for predicting its clinical severity. Moreover, the suggested cut-off value of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score and PhAs to identify tumor aggressiveness should be viewed with caution until results in larger populations become available to perform an appropriate cross-validation. In addition, expert nutritionists are required for the assessment, execution, and interpretation of Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) measurements, such as PhA. The main strength of this study was the use of the 7-day food records. This method is the “gold standard” in validation studies of different self-administered food frequency questionnaires and allows a more accurate measurement of the dietary and macronutrient intakes compared to other questionnaires [46,47].",d8ab2bb1-271c-4723-a4bf-ef68c2aa9369
36,methods36," In order to improve the power of the study, we increased the homogeneity of the cohort of studied patients by including non-functioning treatment-naïve patients or patients who underwent curative surgery and who were biochemically free of disease for more than 6 months and who had not partaken of medical treatment. Moreover, all patients had a diagnosis of well-differentiated G1/G2 GEP-NET and both GEP-NET patients and matched controls were well characterized.  5. Conclusions In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show a novel association between nutritional status and aggressiveness of GEP-NETs in a selected cohort of adult patients. This association potentially extends the benefit of adherence to the MD to GEP-NET patients and suggests that Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) and PhA value may be used as tools for the nutritional management of these patients and as markers of tumor aggressiveness.",36c3c1b9-1a1b-4a46-82ab-d8b1113ad60d
37,methods37," Moreover, this is the first study to indicate a dietary pattern that may be beneficial for GEP-NET patients and that may modulate the risk of tumor aggressiveness, offering a practical strategy for the management of these patients. Therefore, the assessment of nutritional status should be recommended as good clinical practice in the evaluation of GEP-NET patients, in order to identify high-risk subjects with a more aggressive tumor who could better benefit from a nutritional intervention promoting the Mediterranean food pattern. Thus, a skilled nutritionist should be part of the multidisciplinary health care team in NETs management, adapting the specific nutritional needs to the course of the disease. Future well-designed dietary intervention trials on larger population samples are needed to define specific dietary guidelines for NETs and elucidate the beneficial effects of the MD on the survival outcomes of GEP-NET patients.
