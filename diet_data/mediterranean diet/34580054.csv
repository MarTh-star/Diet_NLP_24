0,methods0," 4.1. Extraction of Polyphenols and Glucosinolates and Untargeted UHPLC-QTOF Profiling  The C. spinosa subsp. rupestris plants were grown in Borgo Cisterna (Santa Lucia Cisterna, Macerata Feltria, PU Italy). Flower buds of C. spinosa were washed, frozen at −20 °C, freeze-dried, and shredded.  The untargeted profiling of the powdered Capparis spinosa samples was depicted by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI/QTOF-MS). Powdered samples were processed through ultrasonic-assisted extraction using 0.1% formic acid in 80% methanol as the extraction solvent (1:10 w/v). After centrifugation (7830× g, 10 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was transferred to an HPLC vial for analysis. Previously optimized analytical conditions were followed [72]. In this regard, a C18-column Agilent Zorbax Eclipse Plus (50 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.",ca348c84-49bf-4e16-92fa-cae1b9e740d1
1,methods1,"8 μm) and a water–acetonitrile binary gradient (6% acetonitrile to 94% acetonitrile in 32 min) were used for chromatographic separation. Mass spectrometry was carried out in positive full-scan mode, acquiring ions in the range 100–1200 m/z (scan rate: 0.8 spectra/s, mass resolution 30,000 FWHM). The injection volume was 6 μL, and three replications were analyzed together with a random injection of blank samples (i.e., solvent only). Agilent Profinder B.07 software was then used to process the raw mass features, according to the ‘find-by-formula’ algorithm and considering the whole isotope pattern (i.e., monoisotopic mass, isotopic spacing, and isotopic ratio). Phenol-Explorer 3.6 and a custom database for glucosinolates were used for putative annotation [73]. Accordingly, an additional level of confidence in the annotation was achieved using a typical tolerance of 5 ppm for mass accuracy when considering QTOF instruments.",60ef2e76-4079-488c-ad13-9472d3cf8629
2,methods2," Post-acquisition data filtering, baselining, and normalization were performed using Agilent Mass Profiler Professional B.12.06 software by retaining only those compounds identified within 100% of replications within at least one treatment. For the semi-quantitative analysis, the isobaric compounds were removed from the raw metabolomic dataset. Afterwards, the phenolic compounds and glucosinolates were classified into classes and then quantified using pure reference compounds (purity > 98%) representative of each respective class (i.e., cyanidin for anthocyanins, quercetin for flavonols, luteolin for flavones and other flavonoids, catechin for flavan-3-ols, ferulic acid for phenolic acids, sesamin for lignans, resveratrol for stilbenes, tyrosol for tyrosols and other remaining phenolics, and gluconapin for glucosinolates). The results were expressed as g equivalents (Eq.)/100 g DM.  4.2.",dfea12b0-d4cb-4d8a-aa57-2857ba71f0c0
3,methods3," Assessment of Total Phenolic Content and Antioxidant Activity  Total polyphenolic (TP) content was evaluated in extracts obtained from C. spinosa subsp. rupestris by Folin–Ciocalteu assay [74]. TP levels in C spinosa subsp rupestris (CSE) were expressed as grams of gallic acid equivalent (gallic acid equivalent (GAE)) per 100 g of dry matter (g gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g DM).  The total antioxidant capacity (total antioxidant capacity (TAC)) of C spinosa subsp rupestris (CSE) was determined by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (Oxygen Radical Scavenging Capacity (ORAC)) assay using fluorescein as the fluorescent probe and 2,2′-azobis (2-methylpropionamide) dihydrochloride (and 2 2′ azobis (2 methylpropionamide) dihydrochloride (AAPH)) as the oxidizing agent [75]. Trolox (from 5 to 300 µM) was used to calibrate the assay.",9e2432df-1b47-4a7d-9f3c-9b697caa54ad
4,methods4," Fluorescence emission intensity was recorded every 5 min for 3 h at λ ex 485/λ em 530 nm in a Multi-Mode Microplate Reader SynergyTM HT (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VI, USA). A blank sample containing PBS, Fluorescein, and and 2 2′ azobis (2 methylpropionamide) dihydrochloride (AAPH) was prepared. The final Oxygen Radical Scavenging Capacity (ORAC) values were calculated using the net area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) of decay.

The Pearson’s correlation coefficients (0.01< p < 0.05) between the untargeted phytochemical profiling and the different spectrophotometric assays (i.e., TP and Oxygen Radical Scavenging Capacity (ORAC)) were evaluated using the same statistical software.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, we are able to confirm that C. spinosa rupestris flower buds contain polyphenols and glucosinolates able to exert a higher cytotoxic effect in cancer cells compared to normal cells. Among the mechanisms which explain the role of polyphenols are generation of H2O2 and effects on cell redox signaling.",1d297a22-2856-494d-9295-55af9588b834
