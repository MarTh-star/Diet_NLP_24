0,introduction0,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as a clustering of interrelated metabolic risk factors that include dyslipidemia, hypertension, elevated fasting glucose and abdominal obesity [1]. The condition is widespread among adults from developed countries, with a prevalence of about 20 to 30%, or even higher, and with further increases in prevalence predicted due to the increasing incidence of obesity, diabetes and sedentary lifestyles [2], [3]. As people with MetS are at increased risk of developing both cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) [4] and type 2 diabetes [5], it has become an important public health concern and several organizations have attempted to formulate simple criteria for its diagnosis [3].  According to current guidelines, the first step in the management of MetS should emphasize therapeutic lifestyle modifications [6].",332fb4e1-4a8d-461d-9c7a-e14d23faf0f3
1,introduction1," Although there is general agreement about reducing weight and increasing physical activity, a uniform consensus is lacking as to which diet is optimal [7]. However, epidemiological evidence suggests that individuals with MetS should adhere to a diet low in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and simple sugars, with an increased intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, and whole grains [6], [7]. Interestingly, these features resemble the principles of the traditional Mediterranean diet (MD) [8].  During the last few decades the MD has gained in popularity worldwide due to its reported contribution to lower rates of morbidity (particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD), certain types of cancer, and other chronic conditions) and mortality, and the better health and quality of life of those who adhere to it [8]. Only a few cross-sectional, cohort and intervention studies have analyzed the relationship between MD adherence and the prevalence or incidence of MetS.",60d4aee9-10dc-4332-b059-4e5fbf1c9f88
2,introduction2," However, the results from these studies have provided some evidence of the beneficial role of the MD in MetS and its components [9].  Although the dietary guidelines suggested for people presenting with MetS are similar to those of the MD and other healthy dietary patterns, the MD has a peculiarity of its own: a high content of total fat. This is the most distinguishing feature of the MD, with virgin olive oil (virgin olive oil (VOO)) being the primary source of fat (providing 70–80% of the total fat). Unlike other oils however, the health-giving properties of virgin olive oil (VOO) are derived not solely from its MUFA content (70–80% due to oleic acid), but also from minor components with great biological activity, including squalene, sterols, tocopherol, and highly bioavailable phenolic compounds [10].",dad7b60a-a14d-4bf5-ad74-3af16e407fd3
3,introduction3," Due to this double set of benefits, virgin olive oil (VOO) favors a better lipid profile, reduces blood pressure (BP) levels, endothelial dysfunction, and the inflammatory and prothrombotic environment [11].  Tree nuts that have a unique fatty acid (FA) profile characterized by a high (MUFA+PUFA)/SFA ratio are also typical of the MD pattern. Although only some epidemiological studies have reported the possible benefits of nut consumption for type 2 diabetes and some cancers, their results have been remarkably consistent regarding cardiovascular disease (CVD) [12]. Apart from their favorable lipid profile, nuts contain vegetable proteins, L-arginine, fiber, folic acid, magnesium, copper, and different types of antioxidants such as flavonoids, polyphenols and tocopherols, which contribute to the cardioprotective properties of nuts via several mechanisms [13].",f17e166c-3efd-4241-8855-d898abf5629d
4,introduction4,"  Compliance with a diet is often assessed using dietary surveys, which are associated with substantial measurement errors, whereas biomarkers of intake are potentially independent of these errors [14]. Therefore, an objective and accurate way to monitor fat quality is to record the plasma FA composition [14]. Individual plasma FA are generally expressed as a percentage of total FA. Therefore, changes in one FA may affect the levels of several other FA. Hence, considering the overall pattern of plasma FA may be a more useful measure of dietary quality than individual FA.  There is increasing evidence that the plasma FA composition may be influenced by diet [15]–[18] which may be useful for primary prevention, since an altered FA composition has been associated in several cross-sectional and observational studies with insulin resistance and diabetes [18], [19], obesity [20], cardiovascular disease (CVD) [21], and MetS [22].",c848b8e4-6ce9-4a07-a54e-2c7a50cfbb8e
5,introduction5," However, studies assessing the effect that changes in the diet have on the FA profile and their relation with MetS remain scarce. Therefore, within the framework of a randomized controlled trial designed to compare the effects of two MD, one supplemented with virgin olive oil (VOO) and another supplemented with nuts, with those of a low-fat diet on the cardiovascular outcomes among subjects at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (PREDIMED Study) [23], [24], the aim of this substudy was to analyze the effect of these diets on the plasma FA profile and its relation with MetS status after 1 year of intervention in participants recruited in the Barcelona north, Reus, and Pamplona centers.

The main outcome is an aggregate of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke). The trial was registered with Current Controlled Trials, London (Identifier: ISRCTN35739639). The detailed protocol of the study has been published elsewhere [23], [24].

The present substudy was designed to assess the effects of the dietary interventions on the plasma FA profile and MetS status, two of the secondary outcomes of the PREDIMED study. We report, the results after 1 year's intervention in a subset of participants recruited in three centers of the PREDIMED trial (Barcelona North, Reus, and Pamplona).

Participants Eligible participants for the PREDIMED Study were community-dwelling men, aged 55 to 80 years, and women, aged 60 to 80 years, who met at least one of the two following criteria: diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or presence of three or more cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, overweight or obesity, and family history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD)) [24]. For the present study, 2054 participants were recruited between June 2003 and May 2006 in the Barcelona (n = 320), Reus (n = 678) and Navarra (n = 1056) centers, three of the ten recruitment nodes of the PREDIMED trial.",ac5e4782-1c7b-4e11-acf6-925ff06d2e77
9,methods3," After a screening visit, participants were randomly assigned to one of three diet groups by means of a computer-generated random-number sequence. The plasma FA composition was measured in 22% of the participants who entered this substudy at baseline (n = 450). These participants were selected at random, and matched by age and sex.

Positive recommendations for increasing the consumption of vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish and seafood, and white meats, were given to each group. Negative recommendations included limiting the consumption of red and processed meats, fat-rich dairy products, sweets and pastries, snacks and sweetened beverages. However, recommendations for total fat intake differed between the two MD groups and the low-fat diet groups. Therefore, whereas participants in the low-fat group were advised to reduce all types of fat, recommendations for the MD groups included increasing the intake of vegetable fats and oil.",1d8fdd62-809e-48a2-8d63-92f7c72550fa
11,methods5," No energy restrictions were suggested for any of the intervention groups. Group sessions (up to 20 participants) were organized separately for each of the three intervention groups. The dietitian provided informative talks and written material, with descriptions of target foods, seasonal shopping lists, meal plans, and recipes. Participants in the MD groups were given a free 3-month supply of virgin olive oil (VOO) (1 L/wk) or mixed nuts (30 g/d, as 15 g walnuts, 7.5 g hazelnuts and 7.5 g almonds). The individual and group visits were repeated every 3 months with the same content, with the exception that shopping lists and recipes varied with the season of the year.

Height and weight (with light clothing and no shoes) were recorded using a calibrated balance beam scale and a wall-mounted calibrated stadiometer, respectively. Waist circumference was measured using an anthropometric measuring tape, at a horizontal plane midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate with a validated semi-automatic sphygmomanometer after a minimum of 5 min rest in the seated position.  Laboratory measurements Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast, coded, shipped to a central laboratory, and stored at −80°C until analyses.

14,methods8, Plasma glucose level was analyzed using the glucose-oxidase method; total serum cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured using enzymatic procedures; and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level was determined after precipitation with phosphotungstic acid and magnesium chloride [24]. The plasma FA profile was determined by fast gas chromatography with a previous derivatization to their corresponding fatty acid methyl esters [25]. Results were expressed as relative percentages of total FA. The average of two measures was used for the analysis of laboratory variables both at baseline and 1 year.,0423d120-2f22-40e4-89c4-88544c916699
15,methods9,"  Metabolic syndrome definition The recent definition of MetS proposed by six major organizations and societies (IDF, NHLBI, AHA, WHF, IAC, and IASO) [1] was used in the present study, such that the presence of any three of the five following risk factors constitutes a diagnosis of MetS: elevated WC, elevated TG (≥150 mg/dL), reduced HDL-C (<40 mg/dL in men and <50 mg/dL in women), elevated BP (SBP ≥130 mmHg and/or DBP ≥85 mmHg), and elevated fasting glucose (≥100 mg/dL). Drug treatment for these specific conditions is an alternative indicator. In this definition, it is possible to use either the IDF or the AHA/NHLBI cut-off limits for WC (≥94 cm for men and ≥80 cm for women, or >102 cm for men and >88 cm for women, respectively) in European populations. The latter was used in the present study. ",6601dfdf-bb18-437d-b38e-6fbeda4018cd

Since the statistical distribution of plasma FA concentrations was found to be skewed, geometric means were used to describe FA concentrations. Moreover, FA concentrations were log-transformed for analysis to improve normality. Analysis of variance (analysis to improve normality Analysis of variance (ANOVA)) and the χ2 test were used to determine differences in baseline characteristics in individuals with and without MetS for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Besides the assignation to one MD group, participants were divided into four MetS groups: those who did not change their MetS status after the 1-year intervention (always/never) and those whose status changed (reversion/incidence).",59c0c787-8a94-4a55-8ecf-68f4cbbbe30f

To examine the associations between these changes and the incidence and reversion of MetS, participants were categorized by quartiles of 1-year changes in plasma concentrations of FA. Then, a logistic regression analysis was carried out to calculate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the incidence and reversion of MetS according to these quartiles.",f6b642cb-f41c-4637-ad3d-0c8e1c284e49

The findings in the MD+virgin olive oil (VOO) group (40% and 20.5% of energy from fats and MUFA, respectively) are consistent with those of other intervention studies using MUFA-enriched diets high in fat content and with a similar nutrient composition [26], [27]. This is important since total fat intake modifies the plasma FA composition [28]. In both studies, people receiving a MUFA diet (40%/20% and 39%/20.",abf1fadb-8f43-42d5-8dbc-0219f2cb7724

In addition, the LA concentrations were significantly reduced with an increase in OA due to supplementation. In turn, the MD+nuts group showed reduced concentrations of MA, MGA, POA, and DGLA, while increasing the levels of LA and ALA. These results are consistent with a recent controlled dietary intervention that reported significantly lower serum proportions of PA, SA, POA, and DGLA, but significantly higher proportions of LA and ALA in slightly overweight and hyperlipidemic healthy subjects that consumed a rapeseed oil-based diet rich in MUFA and PUFA (particularly OA, LA, and ALA) compared to a diet high in saturated fat [15].",9ffde1d3-6f84-4e53-8900-f0b7b8cc4b98
31,discussion2," Interestingly, the MD+nuts group diet induced a FA composition that was beneficial in the face of cardiometabolic disease, since high proportions of PA, POA, and DGLA, and reduced levels of LA have been related to several cardiometabolic diseases [18]–[21], including MetS [22]. Consistently, we also found that increases in individual SFA and POA correlated adversely with several metabolic risk factors.  We also examined the association between the adherence to a MD and the incidence, reversion, and changes in prevalence of MetS. Rather than performing analyses according to the intervention group, we used biomarkers of the foods supplied to each group for two reasons. First, as inhabitants of a Mediterranean region, the participants in the control group consumed a lower amount of fatty foods characteristic of the Western diet but not a lower amount of virgin olive oil (VOO) or nuts, which could have attenuated any differences between groups.",b6279e67-f0a7-4f20-b4e0-0ef0c5805c22
32,discussion3," Secondly, since biomarkers are potentially independent of the errors associated with self-report methods [14], they provide an objective and accurate measure of the consumption of MD foods among participants independently of the assigned group. Some FA are considered to be indirect biomarkers of the consumption of individual foods or food groups. This is the case when the food source is the primary source of the FA and it is stable in the sampling medium [14]. According to the correlation analysis, plasma concentrations of OA and ALA were good biomarkers of OO and walnut intake, respectively. Walnuts are characterized by their high ALA content, which, in turn, cannot be synthesized endogenously. Therefore the correlation between ALA in plasma and walnut intake was expected. Regarding OA, being a MUFA, it can be synthesized endogenously from either carbohydrates (carbohydrates (CHO)) or SFA, particularly when MUFA intakes are lower.",b8bcef75-34d2-4ad5-ac50-806fbcb51ced
33,discussion4," Moreover, although OO is the richest dietary source of OA, it is also a major component of most animal fats and makes up a sizable fraction of most vegetable oils. However, while animal fats rich in OA typically contribute considerably to its intake in other European countries, OO was the largest contributor of total fat (70%) in our Catalan population. Moreover, 70–80% of its MUFA content is due to OA. Therefore, OA was a good biomarker of OO consumption in our sample population. In fact, the plasma levels of OA have previously been related to their dietary source in Mediterranean populations [29]. Furthermore, tissue stores of OA were a marker of OO consumption in Spain, but not in the other four European centers of the EURAMIC study [30].",95877ad7-e16f-465c-8e06-64cec939ce3e
34,discussion5,"  Using the biomarkers of foods supplied to the intervention groups we found that the incidence and reversion rates of MetS progressed inversely and in parallel, respectively, to increases in OA and ALA, which resulted in significant differences in the changes in prevalence of MetS across the quartiles of changes in both OA and ALA. Therefore, the beneficial effect of OO and nut consumption on the prevalence of MetS appears to be a consequence of the combination of incidence and reversion rates. However the reduction in the prevalence of MetS obtained in our study was much lower than that reported by other studies showing a beneficial effect of adherence to the MD in terms of MetS prevalence [9]. This could be due to several factors. Firstly, participants in the other intervention studies were younger and all had MetS or impaired glucose tolerance at baseline. Secondly, the carbohydrates (CHO) intake in those studies was higher than that of our study population (>55% of energy vs.",5c207532-3868-49ff-a58c-91863448788a
35,discussion6," 40%) and extensive research has achieved consensus that reducing dietary carbohydrates (CHO) is a critical approach to treating or managing the manifestations of MetS [31]. Finally, energy intake was reduced and physical activity increased in the previous studies so as to achieve weight loss, which is considered the number one priority when treating MetS [6]. However, no restrictions were prescribed in any of our groups, which resulted in a non-significant weight change across the quartiles of changes in OA and ALA. Indeed, a recent study reported that a MD without weight loss led to non-significant changes in the components or prevalence of MetS compared to the control diet, whereas only a small reduction in body weight (10%) reduced the prevalence of MetS by more than 50% [32].",54a87b44-f74d-47be-8e55-7a1902e7969c
36,discussion7," However, the magnitude of the weight loss did not predict the degree of improvement in MetS components while on the MD and patients with the most deteriorated baseline MetS profile presented important cardiometabolic benefits even on a MD without weight loss, suggesting that the MD may achieve beneficial effects even in the absence of weight loss, as was our case.  Apart from the biomarkers of the food supplied, we found that MA and PA were adversely associated with the incidence of MetS. This supports the findings of previous studies about dietary fat quality and disease risk. Hence, substituting unsaturated fat or carbohydrates (CHO) for SFA impairs insulin sensitivity [33] and induces a FA pattern similar to that observed in people with MetS [17], which is also caused by a diet rich in SFA [15].",d3d68483-ad66-4c22-bfdc-2361ef5329cb
37,discussion8," Interestingly, we found that when participants were classified according to their change in MetS status, the changes in these two SFA and the two biomarkers of foods supplied evolved in the MetS incidence group in the opposite direction to that of the other groups, with the exception of PA. Thus, while the incidence group showed a significant increase in the proportions of MA and PA and a reduction in the levels of OA and ALA, subjects in the other groups presented a non-significant decrease in the proportions of MA but an increase in the OA and ALA levels. Importantly, although between-group changes in these four FA were not always significant, they differed significantly between the MetS incidence and reversion groups. In fact participants in the reversion group showed the highest reduction in MA, the lowest increase in PA, and the highest increase in both OA and ALA among the non-incident groups, which could explain the change in their MetS status.",f8a83a8d-0289-4309-8982-885e6fd744b8
38,discussion9," However, the increase in OA and ALA concentrations observed in participants who always had MetS was probably not enough compared with that of the MetS reversion group to experience a change in their MetS status after the intervention. Furthermore, participants who never had MetS during the intervention probably did not present MetS after 1 year of intervention because they had also significantly increased both OA and ALA.  Interestingly, all these effects were observed without a weight increase despite the high fat content of both MDs. In fact, a meta-analysis of 21 epidemiological studies regarding MD and obesity showed that no studies reported significantly increased obesity in response to a MD. Moreover, over half of the studies provided evidence that adherence to a MD was associated with less overweight/obesity or promoted weight loss [34].",5849450e-a9d4-4244-bb52-aa5ad5be63e0
39,discussion10," This lack of weight gain and the improvement in overweight or obesity may be due to the increased postprandial fat oxidation, diet-induced thermogenesis and overall daily energy expenditure induced by OO [35] and nut [36] consumption, as well as to a satiating effect [36], [37].  Since the primary endpoint for the treatment of MetS is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), traditional dietary recommendations such as those proposed by the NCEP, AHA and NHLBI essentially involve following a low-fat diet and achieving weigh reduction by a combination of reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity. In our study, however, we found that a high-fat (>40% of energy) non-energy-restricted diet showed a reduction in MetS prevalence without the need for weight loss or prescribed physical activity. There are several important aspects to consider regarding the MD followed in this study.",acbcc560-9cf9-4949-94d1-4912b10983a3
40,discussion11," First of all, it is highly palatable, decreases hunger, and promotes satiety, hence improving long-term adherence compared to low-fat energy-restricted diets [31]. Secondly, no weight gain was observed in participants with high virgin olive oil (VOO) or nut consumption. Finally, a usual consequence of low-fat diets is unrestricted carbohydrates (CHO) intake, which has been shown to result in reduced HDL-C levels and raised TG levels, thus exacerbating the MetS status [31]. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that there is no rationale for maintaining the fear that a MD rich in fats of vegetable origin may cause weight gain, and that it may be a useful alternative to traditional low-fat diets for the dietary treatment of MetS.
