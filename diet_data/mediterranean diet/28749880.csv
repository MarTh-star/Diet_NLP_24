0,methods0,"2.1. Subjects and Study Design The study consisted of a crossover randomized clinical trial with three different interventions. The interventions consisted of a single administration of 25 mL of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), 150 mL of RW, or the combination of both 25 mL of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and 150 mL of RW. Treatment quantities were equivalent to normal dietary doses of a typical MD. A total of twelve healthy subjects (50% women, 34.0 ± 10.5, BMI = 22.0 ± 3.3 kg/m2) participated in the study. The study was explained to participants through verbal and written instructions, and written informed consent was obtained before participation. Volunteers received each treatment in a randomized manner. The study included three experimental sessions in which each intervention was administered under fasting conditions. Each experimental session was preceded by a two-day washout period. The total duration of the study was nine days.",36b43cca-9d5b-4952-b316-2c90ee173632
1,methods1,"  To standardize baseline concentrations of phenolic compounds, subjects were asked to follow a low phenolic content diet, in which participants excluded olive oil and derivates, grapes and derivatives, and all alcoholic beverages from their diet. The low phenolic content diet was followed for two days prior to each intervention and during each experimental session.  On the day of the intervention, subjects consumed one of the three interventions within a period of 5–10 min. Urine was collected in separate fractions, at baseline (−2–0 h), to assess dietary compliance and during 6 h after each dietary intervention (0–6 h). The amount of urine in each fraction was measured, acidified with 6 M HCl, and stored at −20 °C until analysis. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Parc de Salut Mar (CEIC-PSMAR) (Spain), and the clinical trial was registered at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (NCT03614520).  2.2.",185f2a3f-e9bc-41f2-a6f1-47400b31a3f6
2,methods2," Red Wine and Extra Virgin Olive Oil Red wine of the Merlot variety (Cristiari d’Alòs 2014, 13% v/v ethanol, Costers del Segre, Lleida, Spain) was selected for its high content of resveratrol and piceid (reservatrol-3-β-mono-d-glucoside) in comparison to other red wine varieties [22]. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) administrated in the study was produced from arbequina olives obtained directly from olives and extracted solely by mechanical means (Germanor, Les Borges Blanques, Lleida, Spain).  2.3.

The extracted samples were analyzed using an Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA) 6890 N gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 mass-selective detector. For chromatographic separation, a 5% phenyl-dimethyl-polysiloxane Zebron™ (Torrance, CA, USA) fused-silica capillary column (15 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness) was used. The split injection mode using helium as a carrier gas (0.9 mL/min) was applied. The temperatures of the injector and transfer line were set at 280 °C. Gas chromatographic conditions were as follows: initial oven temperature at 80 °C, raised by 20 °C/min to 200 °C, then by 10 °C/min to 300 °C, and maintained at 300 °C for 3 min.",b1a0a851-cf10-4530-a3e0-6382de8e237d

Ions at m/z 444 (resveratrol (RESV) and piceid), m/z 179 (dihydro-resveratrol (RESV)), and m/z 412 (diethylstilbestrol), were selected for the quantitative analysis. For the confirmation of the compounds, the ions chosen were m/z 445 for resveratrol (RESV) and piceid, m/z for 446 dihydro-resveratrol (RESV), and m/z 397 and 383 for diethylstilbestrol.  2.5. Extraction and Analysis of Hydroxytyrosol in Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Red Wine and Urine Samples 2.5.1. Extra Virgin Olive Oil tyrosol (TYR) and HT content in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after a triple liquid-liquid extraction, as previously described [23]. Briefly, aliquots of 1 mL of olive oil were spiked with 10 µL of IS (containing 100 µg/mL of HT-D3 and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol).",a7a80b4c-edbd-4034-91ac-defa4fdd6840
9,methods9," A first liquid-liquid extraction was performed with 10 mL of methanol/water solution (80:20, v/v) containing 1 mM of ascorbic acid to avoid phenol degradation during the process. Tubes were shaken for 60 min, and then centrifuged (2000 g, 5 min). The organic phase was transferred into a new tube and evaporated under a nitrogen stream at 30 °C to a final remaining volume of 2 mL of an aqueous extract of olive oil. Thereafter, metabisulfite was added to the samples to prevent oxidation. To hydrolyze all the conjugated forms of tyrosol (TYR) and HT, samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with HCl (1.5 mmol/tube), to mimic gastrointestinal conditions during digestion. Following that, a liquid-liquid extraction was performed by adding 4 mL of a mixture of ethyl acetate and acetonitrile (4:1 v/v) shaking for 30 min and centrifuging (2000 g, 5 min).",9a526c3f-427a-4df8-8a10-539bb697571a

16,methods16," Phenolic Content in Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Red Wine In order to characterize the principal phenolic compounds of the interventions, Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and RW were analyzed in triplicate. Table 1 shows the concentration observed for resveratrol (RESV) and its isomers, corresponding to RW, and the concentration of HT and tyrosol (TYR) of RW and Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) treatments.  RW contained a concentration of 2.4 ± 0.1 mg/L of t-resveratrol (RESV), while the concentration of c-resveratrol (RESV) was found to be 3.0 ± 0.4 mg/L. Regarding piceid, t-piceid was determined at a concentration of 4.9 ± 0.2 mg/L and its isomer cis obtained a concentration of 3.0 ± 0.5 mg/L. HT and tyrosol (TYR) were also analyzed in RW with concentrations of 1.5 ± 0.1 and 35.0 ± 1.0 mg/L, respectively, and in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), HT was detected at a concentration of 19.8 ± 1.9 mg/L and tyrosol (TYR) at 24.1 ± 2.8 mg/L.

Regarding Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), 25 mL of the dose administrated corresponds to 0.50 mg of HT and 0.60 mg of tyrosol (TYR).  3.2. Quantification of Phenolic Compounds in Urine 3.2.1. Baseline Diet compliance was assessed by the baseline analysis of urine samples collected 2 h before the beginning of the intervention (−2 to 0 h). Volunteers followed the washout recommendations perfectly since no resveratrol (RESV) was observed in baseline urine samples. In terms of HT, tyrosol (TYR), and metabolites, as they are endogenous compounds, traces could be observed in baseline samples, but these were not attributed to the diet contribution.  3.2.2.

Urinary recovery of t-resveratrol (RESV) after 6 h in the RW treatment was 59.2 ± 28.7 nmol, while after RW + Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), the concentration of this compound reached 61.7 ± 42.4 nmol. Similar results were obtained with dihydro-resveratrol (RESV), which increased its concentration following RW + Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) treatment compared with RW (13.0 ± 8.3 nmol RW + Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) vs. 10.9 ± 7.5 nmol RW). Regarding c-resveratrol (RESV), the compound also presented a greater increase in RW + Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) treatment, although none of the interventions presented significant differences, probably due to high interindividual differences.  3.2.3.",05ee004c-8f15-41d4-8d34-54856116516a

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) + RW had the highest recovery. Similar results were obtained regarding tyrosol (TYR) metabolites, and significant differences were obtained between Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) + RW and RW and between Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) + RW and Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), but no difference was observed in tyrosol (TYR) recovery between Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and RW.",3c736b59-7d4b-4d42-b2b3-55f7a3ba7df9
20,methods20,"  When analyzing the different metabolic pathways in more depth after each intervention, it was observable that free forms were present at low concentrations (between 10–15% of the total), while the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates were the most abundant. HT-sulfate increased following both interventions, whereas tyrosol (TYR)-sulfate was increased exclusively after RW; on the contrary, HT-sulfate-acetate was only present after Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). When comparing glucuronides, HT-glucuronide was only generated after the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) treatment, and HVALc-glucuronide was detectable after RW, but its major contributor was Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Finally, tyrosol (TYR)-glucuronide increased equally after both interventions (Figure 3).  3.3.

Discussion It is the first time in humans that the interaction between RW and Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is evaluated in terms of the metabolic disposition of the main phenolic compounds of both Mediterranean food components. Here, we report that recoveries of phenolic compounds from RW and Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) are altered when combining both foods. There is a recovery of HT and related compounds that doubles the expected concentrations taking into consideration amounts of HT present in RW and Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) at the doses administered. On the other hand, a non-significant increase of resveratrol-related compounds is observed when combining RW and Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).",fbc3bf59-5321-4732-9889-84ff045b42c3
22,methods22,"  The study of the interaction of both foods is of relevance since phenolic compounds typically have a poor bioavailability, being very much dependent on the matrix in which they are present [6,10,26]. The mixture of a fatty matrix and a hydro-alcoholic one may influence its bioavailability. Some preliminary results suggest that this would be the case and that the interaction may result in beneficial health effects [27].  In the case of HT, we previously reported that there is an interaction between alcohol and phenolic components of RW, in particular, tyrosol (TYR). Alcohol, on the one hand, interacts with dopamine oxidative metabolism, promoting a shift in its metabolic pathways. A minor pathway from DOPAL (3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) to DOPET (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol, also known as HT) becomes more apparent in the presence of alcohol. In humans, we have demonstrated that DOPET (HT) generation is alcohol dose dependent [18].",a925cd69-20d6-4cda-9b85-89b894276d49
23,methods23," Similarly there is an increased synthesis of tyrosol (TYR) via tyrosine metabolic disposition in an analogous way, as described for the dopamine and ethanol interaction. Although there is a contribution of dopamine and tyrosine when alcohol is consumed in the formation of HT and tyrosol (TYR), this does not suffice to explain recoveries of HT and tyrosol (TYR) [19]. We demonstrated in vivo, in animal models, and in vitro, in human liver biopsies, that the most likely explanation for higher recoveries of both phenolic compounds is the biotransformation of tyrosol (TYR) to HT, a reaction regulated by the polymorphic enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2A6 [20]. Ethanol contributes to this reaction by increasing tyrosol (TYR) bioavailability and then favoring the biotransformation reaction. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the contribution of this reaction leading to HT formation by RW is quite substantial when compared to recoveries after Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).",6d94fdb2-d531-4389-b16a-577f846812a5
24,methods24," The dose of total HT contained in RW represents 44% of the one contained in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Nevertheless, the total HT recovery following RW represents 60% of the recovery after Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). This observation confirms an endogenous formation of HT following RW consumption.  The metabolic disposition of HT has been reviewed recently [2]. When comparing the metabolic pathways of HT for Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and RW, a higher recovery of unaltered HT is observed after Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Therefore the impact of HT from Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) when compared to RW in terms of biological effects would be superior. Nonetheless, when looking at metabolic pathways, it is apparent that HT-sulfate and tyrosol (TYR)-sulfate recoveries are higher after RW than after Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), and 60% of the total metabolites were sulfate conjugates in the case of RW compared with the 32% in the case of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).",e9fad506-e71f-4a0f-bb28-8a13e4fc1d71
25,methods25," This is of relevance since these metabolites have been reported to be biologically active, specifically preventing the effects of oxidized cholesterol, and not the corresponding glucuronide metabolite [28].  Regarding resveratrol, marginally higher concentrations of t-resveratrol (RESV), c-resveratrol (RESV), and dihydro-resveratrol (RESV) are observed after RW combined with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), suggesting that resveratrol bioavailability is slightly increased in the presence of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).
