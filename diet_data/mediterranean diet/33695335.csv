0,methods0," 2.1. Study Population  A cross-sectional study was conducted within two centers of the Spanish European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Granada and European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Gipuzkoa. In brief, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) is a large European multicentric study that was designed to identify risk factors linked to the development of cancer and other chronic diseases. European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain is one of the participating countries, contributing with over forty-four hundred participants (aged between 32 and 69 years) to the overall study.",dba60e0e-c762-453c-bcac-67605d113452
1,methods1," Participants were recruited by five centers (Gipuzkoa, Navarra and Asturias in the North of Spain, and Murcia and Granada in the South of Spain) between 1992–1996, the coordination center of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain being located in Barcelona. All were mostly blood donors and volunteers. Details of the design and methodology of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain study have been described elsewhere [25,26]. Approval for the study was obtained from the ethical review boards of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and from the Medical Ethical Committee of Bellvitge Hospital (Barcelona, Spain). At the time the study sample was recruited, ethical protocol codes were not requested.",848a3970-74e8-473b-a63a-75aff0b26cf4
2,methods2," Also, participants participated voluntarily in the study; all agreed to participate and to provide information on lifestyle and other variables for the study.  In order to account for a north-south dietary gradient, we considered participants from the two aforementioned European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain centers. Both comprised 16,296 participants (N of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Granada = 7879 and N of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Gipuzkoa = 8417). Three hundred twenty-five individuals with extreme values of energy intake, below the first percentile (836 kcal/day) and above the 99th percentile (4119 kcal/day) of the distribution of energy intake, respectively, were excluded. Also, 1215 participants with prevalent diseases at baseline were excluded, leaving 14,756 healthy participants available for analysis.",ccbbac9f-a68e-4cfc-8810-afea8662d4fa
3,methods3,"  For the biomarker study we considered subsample of 210 participants with complete information on diet, lifestyle and biomarker data. This sample was randomly chosen (by strata of sex, age and center) from the study sample. These participants were non users of dietary supplements and of drugs known to prompt OS, as well as participants who provided fasting blood samples. More details on the selection of these participants are provided elsewhere [21].  2.2. Data Collection: Dietary and Lifestyle Factors Assessment  The participants of both centers provided information about their dietary intake by means of a validated diet history questionnaire [27]. The questionnaire was administered through in-person interviews to collect information on the intake of more than 600 food items from the previous year. Seasonal variations in food consumption as well as other dietary issues, such as use of fats in the preparation of meals and consumption of alcoholic beverages were considered [25,27].",4a261888-e009-4598-a3ea-ce0f0623a2da
4,methods4," Intake of nutrients, along with total energy intake, were derived from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Nutrient Database-European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) food composition data tables [28].  More details on how the dietary antioxidant profile was derived (vitamins, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total polyphenols, flavonoids, lignans and other diet components) in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study can be found in Hernández-Ruiz, et al. 2018 [29]. In short, this information was derived from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-EPIC nutrient database project (ENDB) database, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) values in food, and the Phenol Explorer database [18,28,30,31]. The Polyphenol Antioxidant Content (Polyphenol Antioxidant Content (PAC)) score was calculated from seven different polyphenols [30].",e07b2ea3-38ec-4433-ad8c-7efd62a6a37c
5,methods5,"  Participants were also asked to provide information about lifestyle habits, including smoking status (never, former, and current smoker), and smoking habits among smokers (intensity and duration of smoking). Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist and hip circumference) were also undertaken using standard protocols in all centers [31]. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. According to World Health Organisation (WHO) and ATP III cut-off points [32,33], we classified subjects into normal weight (Body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2), overweight (Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2) and obese (Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2) participants, and into normal waist circumference (WC) and abdominal obese (≥102 cm and ≥88 cm, in men and women, respectively) participants.  Regarding PA, information on occupational and leisure activities was collected through a validated PA questionnaire.",657cc4f2-d54b-4746-8b20-46c78679215a
6,methods6," This information was used to derive PA levels as inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, and active (in metabolic equivalent units) [34].  2.3. Oxidative Balance Score (Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)) Components and Their Integration into Nutrient, Lifestyle and Food-Based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s  Two Oxidative Balance Scores (Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s) and their simplified versions were developed. Overall, the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s were created so that higher scores could relate to predominance of antioxidant exposure.",1e38058b-cdb7-46cc-a3fc-99d2df7dfb95
7,methods7," In particular, these scores were: 1) the Nutrient-Lifestyle Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) (NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)), 2) the Food-Lifestyle Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) (FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)), and their simplified versions with dietary factors or lifestyle factors only: the Nutrient-based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) (Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)), the Lifestyle Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) (L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)), and the Food-based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) (Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)). Supplementary Table S1 shows a summary of components considered in each Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS). All dietary, lifestyle and food components were selected due to their potential antioxidant and pro-oxidant components, considering their impact on the individual´s oxidative/antioxidant status.",06781b67-2349-41c5-9101-5769fdc7a618
8,methods8," The rationale for their inclusion in these Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) has been provided in a review on applications and methods of Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s [22]. Likewise, regarding the food-based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) that we propose in this study, a summary as of why these components were chosen can be found in Supplementary Table S2.  The NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS): As aforementioned, its development has been based on the most widely applied concept of Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s in the literature [22].",2a71d293-d19e-4de2-97fb-5aa3caa9e7ca
9,methods9," This NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) included 14 dietary and lifestyle components, namely: dietary antioxidant components (vitamin C, β-carotene, vitamin E (α-tocopherol), three global antioxidant potential measures (trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), representing dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and the Polyphenol Antioxidant Content (PAC) score); dietary pro-oxidants components (polyunsaturated fatty acids and heme-iron), some lifestyle antioxidants components (PA) and lifestyle pro-oxidants components: obesity in terms of Body mass index (BMI) and WC, alcohol consumption, smoking habits and excess energy intake, this being the difference between the reported total dietary intake and the estimated total energy requirement.",b73774d7-ccc2-4731-9ee2-596a33a4959b
10,methods10,"  All dietary variables were categorized into quintiles according to their distribution in the study population; for antioxidants (presumed to counteract OS), subjects who were in the lowest quintile of intake (quintile 1), were assigned 1 point, those who were in quintile 2, 2 points, and so forth. At the highest intake category (quintile 5), the maximum score of 5 points was awarded. Concerning the components with pro-oxidant potential (presumed to induce OS), the score was reversed, i.e., the lowest intake (quintile 1) was considered the least pro-oxidant and participants received 5 points, and so forth, until reaching the highest intake level (quintile 5) where participant got 1 point. Thus, these nutrient components were unweighted in the overall score because their contribution to the individual´s oxidative/antioxidant status was considered equally important. This view is based on previous nutrient-based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s [22].",2df37f47-f86a-4940-a011-aa3657a51bb0
11,methods11," The lifestyle factor components were PA, obesity, smoking and energy intake. Their scoring was formulated as follows: - for PA, there were 3 categories established: sedentary/inactive = 1 point; moderately active = 3 points; active = 5 points;  - for alcohol, 1 to 5 points were assigned according to sex-specific levels of its consumption (men who consumed: ≤10 g/day = 5 points, ≤20 g/day = 4 points, ≤50 g/d = 3 points, ≤75 g/d = 2 points, and >75 g/d = 1 point, and women who consumed: ≤5 g/d = 5 points, ≤15 g/d = 4 points, ≤25 g/d = 3 points, ≤50 g/d = 2 points, and >50 g/d = 1 point;  - for overweight and obesity the assessment was made by classifying the subjects into 5 categories according to criteria established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Spanish Society for the Study of Obesity (Study of Obesity (SEEDO)) [32,35]: <25 kg/m2 = 5 points), ≤ 26.9 kg/m2 = 4 points, ≤29.9 kg/m2 = 3 points, <35 kg/m2 = 2 points, and ≥ 35 kg/m2 = 1 point.",6687aff6-ad35-433b-b366-022c4fcdafa0
12,methods12," Similarly, for abdominal obesity, following ATP III [33], the following points were assigned: men up to 102 cm of WC = 5 points, and 1 point otherwise, and women up to 88 cm = 5 points, while 1 point was given in the opposite case.  - for smoking, participants were classified as non-smokers = 5 points, former smokers = 3 points, or current smokers = 1 point. for excessive energy intake, when the reported intake was close to estimated energy expenditure = 5 points, if the intake did not exceed 10% of the requirement = 4 points, if it exceeded up to 20% = 3 points, for 30% of excessive intake= 2 points, and if it was above this amount = 1 point. The estimated energy expenditure was calculated beforehand as the amount of energy needed to maintain essential body functions plus the amount required to support the daily PA [36].  Finally, the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) was calculated by adding the points assigned to each component, of both antioxidant and pro-oxidant factors.",4d923928-9997-4c4c-8da2-020c8b81bc18
13,methods13," This score ranged from 14–70 points.  The FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS): This Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) was developed to further to replace dietary aspects of the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) by foods. The foods selected were those that contribute most notably to the dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Pro-oxidant foods with a high content of pro-oxidant nutrients were also considered. Overall, there were 11 food components included in this Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS): 6 antioxidant-like food components (vegetables, fruits and juices, legumes, olive oil, blue or fatty fish and coffee and tea) and five pro-oxidant-like food components (meats and meat products, biscuits and pastries, fats and oils-except olive oil, snacks and sauces, cereals, and derived products, refined, roasted and fried). Other potential anti-oxidant foods (e.g., whole grains or nuts) were not considered due to the very low consumption pattern in this study population.",b3925f38-01ed-4da9-b9ad-c214c6d7a142
14,methods14," On the other hand, the lifestyle factors components considered in this Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) were those included in the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS).  Again, each component was divided into quintiles. The assignment of points was carried out as described above: in the case of foods rich in antioxidants, the lowest consumption quintile (quintile 1) received 1 point, the second quintile of lower consumption (quintile 2), received 2 points, and so forth, up to the quintile with the highest consumption (quintile 5), where 5 points were assigned. For pro-oxidant components, the scores were also reversed. In order to account for differences arising from the antioxidant potential of the food components, we considered to weight the components according to their antioxidant/pro-oxidant power.",b6945907-58fc-441e-ab16-d7343e688236
15,methods15," Specifically, we halved the points for those antioxidant components with intermediate antioxidant potential according to experimental total antioxidant capacity (TAC) values (legumes, olive oil, fatty fish, cookies and pastries, snacks and sauces, cereals and products) [18,37]. Thus, this scoring system was the same as described above for the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), except that some food components were somehow weighted regarding their antioxidant potential. This FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) considered 17 components in total, including 11 food/food groups components and six lifestyle components, the total score reaching a maximum score of 70 points.",4cc73b05-e299-4aed-b3e0-f5ff7ff1af1e
16,methods16,"  The simplified Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) versions: Two modified versions of the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) were developed: one that included dietary components only (8 components), the Nutrient Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) (Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)) and another one that included lifestyle components only (6 components), the Lifestyle Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) (L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)). The maximum scores reached in these modified Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s were 40 and 30 points, respectively. Furthermore, we developed the lifestyle and food-based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) (FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)) in order to adjust components more easily. This Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) included 6 lifestyle components and 11 food components; the latter were separated into another Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) made up of food components only (Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)).  2.4.",058d5c7b-3008-4b9b-9901-1fe3c78e58a7
17,methods17," Validation Study of the Oxidative Balance Scores: Relationship with Scores of Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and with Biomarkers  Two validation studies were carried out to prove that the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s were effective tools to capture the individual´s oxidative and antioxidant status: (i) a validation study using scores of adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD), a dietary pattern rich in powerful antioxidants [29]; and, (ii) a validation study using biomarkers of OS, inflammation and antioxidant nutrients. The purpose was to verify whether higher values in the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s (towards more antioxidant-like states) were related to a higher adherence to the MD (towards a more antioxidant-like dietary pattern). In fact, a higher adherence to the MD, i.e., higher values in the scores, have been related to a higher intake of dietary nutrient antioxidants [29].",df6a9f46-08e5-49f7-bd40-adaed91c0433
18,methods18," In this same line of thought, we sought to examine whether higher Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s values were related to higher plasma levels of antioxidants. Given the link between OS and inflammation [6,38], we also considered inflammation and OS markers in this biomarker-based validation study. In this case, we hypothesized that a negative relationship exists between the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s and these markers (i.e., higher values of Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) related to lower levels of OS and inflammation markers).  For the validation study comprising the MD scores, the complete study sample of 14,756 subjects was used. In addition, we considered a total of 20 MD scores; all were previously applied in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Granada and Gipuzkoa study in a comparative study of their antioxidant profile [29,39].  For the validation study based on the biomarkers, we considered the subsample of 210 participants.",3ed43f8f-8893-4d9b-8911-4350e93439df
19,methods19," As described previously [21], a set of biomarkers were quantified in fasting blood samples (plasma) that were collected at recruitment. These biomarkers were: (a) antioxidant vitamins (ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acid, as well as total vitamin C, α-tocopherol, β-carotene, vitamin A (retinol); coenzymes (coenzyme Q9 and Q10); (b) total antioxidant capacity (TAC): trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) without uric acid, TEAC-ABTS, PT, ORAC with proteins and ORAC without proteins; (c) inflammation markers: C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)), Interleukin 6 and 8 (IL-6, IL-8) and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α); (d) markers of oxidative stress (uric acid) and metabolic risk (adiponectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 PAI-1, and resistin). The details of laboratory methods used and quality controls applied to each biomarker are provided in Carrión-García, et al., 2020 [21].",37db946d-c14c-4709-ac6d-ca8761476e08
20,methods20," In brief, the determination of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of the plasma samples was carried out with the methods of trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) [40], ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) [41], TEAC-ABTS [42], and ORAC [43]. The total polyphenols were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method [44]. Antioxidant capacity was expressed as μmol Trolox Equivalent/L of plasma. To rule out the possible influence of proteins on the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in terms of ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) [19], the concentration of uric acid (~60% contribution to ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)), measure of non-uric ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) (ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)–2*uric acid) was also considered. Likewise, the influence of proteins was accounted for in the ORAC assays.",0ec0bd81-9bef-4767-ae65-9c29f96b79f3
21,methods21," Biomarkers of antioxidant nutrients were determined by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)) and mass spectrometer Acquity ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) BEH system. Biomarkers of inflammation were determined using Luminex technology. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) techniques were used to assess uric acid. In addition, C reactive protein (CRP) were quantified made using immunoturbidimetric determination. In all determinations, duplicate measurements were considered to estimate the intra- and inter-test coefficient of variation. This coefficient was less than 5% in the case of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), TP, and antioxidant nutrients, and less than 10% in the case of uric acid, C reactive protein (CRP), and all other markers.",8df3eb67-3b69-4338-a23c-78aa0f62177e
22,methods22," While we measured other biomarkers of OS and inflammation (for example, oxidized LDL, malondialdehyde and IL-1), due to excessive variability in the measurements, we discarded these markers in this study.  2.5. Statistical Analyses  All Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s were considered as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable, according to tertiles (T): lower score = T1, medium score = T2 and higher score = T3. Descriptive analyses were carried out by sex, centre and other characteristics of the study sample. The normality of all variables (kurtosis, skewness, and Shapiro–Wilk test) was studied, and a logarithmic transformation was performed on variables that did not show a normal distribution. Descriptive statistics were based on frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and means and standard deviation for continuous variables (with normal distribution).",2e5dc1e4-0980-410b-9d43-c6b75a3ace19
23,methods23," In addition, Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) scales and categories were compared by type of components (dietary, lifestyle and foods), scores of adherence to the MD and by plasma levels of antioxidants, inflammation and OS markers. To assess the differences between the groups (by sex and center, and by Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) tertiles; i.e., by two or three groups), we considered the t-Student or ANOVA tests (continuous variables, normal distribution), and Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests (non-normal distribution), to compare two or more than two groups, as well as the Chi-squared test for categorical variables.  Non-parametric Spearman correlation analyses between all continuous variables were performed to study the direction and magnitude of the associations between the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), the dietary and lifestyle factor components, and the biomarkers. Heat map charts were created to visualize these correlations by the rho coefficients.",ceca686b-741f-49c9-92d0-3c255226c64b
24,methods24,"  Different multivariate linear regression models were considered to examine the relationship between the different Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s (X: independent variable) and a set of 20 MD scores (Y: dependent variable) [29]. Since it is necessary for a dependent variable to be normally distributed in linear regression models, we considered log-transformed biomarker and MD score variables. The models were defined as: Logbiomarkers or MD scores=β0+β1Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)1+β2X2+β3X3…+ε  The beta (β) coefficient, 95% confidence intervals and R2 determination coefficient were derived from these models. The Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s were considered either as continuous variable or as categorical variable, the first tertile being the reference category. Thus, β coefficient were interpreted per increments of one unit in the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) score (towards a more antioxidant status) or by the second or third tertile compared to the first tertile, respectively.",ee63dcbf-54ce-4768-a8c8-ab6c09362293
25,methods25," A first model adjusted for age, sex, and centre, was considered. A second model was further adjusted for total energy intake. In a third model we adjusted for lifestyle factors involved in OS, namely Body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2, smoking status and PA levels. Particularly, this third model was considered in those Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) that were based on dietary factors only (Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), without the lifestyle components) to better understand the effect of these lifestyle components on the associations, whereas the first and second models were considered in all Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS).  To assess the potential modifying effect of sex and center on these associations, models with and without a term of interaction (variable*sex or center) were considered, evaluating whether there were statistically significant differences between the two models through the likelihood ratio test.",5a508dc2-0e19-4000-a61c-5d9a416e01de
26,methods26," Stratified analyses by sex and center were also performed. Similarly, multivariate linear regression models were also applied to examine the association between the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s and the biomarkers (Y: dependent variable). All independent variables were log-transformed to approximate a normal distribution.  Given that we lacked values on some biomarkers, we conducted the analyses on the complete data, which is known to lead to bias estimates when the data are not missing completely at random [45]. The missing biomarker data in our study can be considered missing at random (missing at random (MAR)); for instance, the study center was related to the missing at random (MAR) pattern (p < 0.05). The missingness proportions varied from 0.3% (in plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC)) to 40% (in β-carotene). Imputation of missing data is very convenient even for relatively high proportions of missing data [46].",c9bb66fa-ad24-453d-81e0-4d8fa8916e32
27,methods27," We decided to not impute missing values of α-carotene due to excess in missing data (90%). Thus, we applied multiple imputation by chained equations (multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE)) to substitute the missing values [47]. We used predictive mean matching in a multivariate model including sex, age, center, bath, Body mass index (BMI) and PA as covariates, with 10 iterations.  As a sensitivity analysis, to check the robustness of the results, the influence of extreme values and influential points of the biomarkers on the results obtained was evaluated. These points were identified by calculating Cook´s distances of each biomarker in the multivariate linear regression models, and comparing the results obtained after excluding these points [48]. Also, we compared results obtained in the biomarker analysis by complete-case analysis and by the imputed data.",17ad4a1f-deb1-4e3a-93dc-866abcd77e09
28,methods28," Finally, we verified that assumptions of linear regression models (linearity, homoscedasticity, normality, and absence of multicollinearity) were met (data not shown).  Statistically significant results were regarded as those p-values < 0.05. To account for multiple testing issues, we considered the Bonferroni corrected p-value threshold (0.05/20 MD sores or 25 biomarkers: 0.025 and 0.002, respectively). All analyses were performed using R software version 3.5.1 (R Core Team. R: a language and environment for statistical computing. R Found. Stat. Comput. 2018. http://www.r-project.org/, last accessed on 15 December 2021). Some of the R packages used were: mice, car, outliers, Hmisc and heatmaps.  3. Results  Below we describe the results regarding the characteristics of the different Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s developed within this study, and of the validation study.  3.1.",e64a5503-6678-4fcc-8c56-5c033191a72a
29,methods29," Characteristics of the Study Sample by the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s and FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)  Table 1 shows characteristics of the study sample by sex and center, and according to the components of the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS). There were 72% of men in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Gipuzkoa, and 27.7% in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Granada. The average age was 51 years in men and 49 years in women. Energy intake was significantly lower in women (1779 kcal/d) than in men (2521 kcal/d) (p-value < 0.001). Regarding the distribution in quintiles or categories of the components of this Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), statistically significant differences were found between men and women in all components (p-value < 0.001). The most notable differences between men and women were observed for the alcohol and heme-iron component.",16d40f99-448a-4028-a236-5ee8d493e2ed
30,methods30," By center, there were also statistically significant differences in the distribution of all the components (p-value < 0.001). For instance, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Gipuzkoa center presented a higher proportion of subjects classified in the quintile scoring highest for the vitamin and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) components. By contrast, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Granada center received higher scores in the components of alcohol consumption, smoking habits, and that of excessive energy intake, than the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Gipuzkoa center. Also, participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Gipuzkoa center were more physically active and had lower Body mass index (BMI) and WC, than those of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Granada center.",0b805b43-95d1-42d1-ae2c-d5aeb111590c
31,methods31,"  The overall NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) score was 48.6 points for men and 45.2 for women, this difference being statistically significant (p-value < 0.001). A higher proportion of men were classified in T3 (40.3%), while women were classified more frequently in T1 (41.9%). The average score was also significantly higher (p-value < 0.001) in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Gipuzkoa center (47.7 points) with respect to the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Granada center (45 points). In fact, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Granada presented more participants in the first tertile compared to European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Gipuzkoa (43.6 vs. 25.8%, p-value < 0.001).",fcbae907-74ef-4c6d-92eb-606e83f63b8d
32,methods32,"  Supplementary Table S3 shows the characteristics of the study population and components across tertiles of NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) (low, medium, and high scores). Subjects in the tertile of greater adherence (T3) consumed more energy (2278 kcal/d) and were younger (mean age: 48.6 years) than those classified in T1 (1798 kcal/d and 50.9 years) (p-value < 0.001). The mean score in every tertile was 38.7, 47 and 54.5, respectively.  Regarding the FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), as shown in Supplementary Table S4, there were also statistically significant differences between men and women in the food components (p-value < 0.001). Men were more frequently in the fifth quintile of intake of these foods than women, except for coffee and tea, meats, snacks and sauces, cereals and derived products. However, no statistically significant differences were observed by sex with respect to the average score (p-value = 0.944) or tertile classification (p-value = 0.286).",0cb93a2f-7f64-49a7-bcfb-5969a2ad7be5
33,methods33," By center, statistically significant differences were also found in almost all components (p-value < 0.001). Adherence to the FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) was higher in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Gipuzkoa (50.7 points) than in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Granada (49.5 points), this difference being statistically significant (p-value < 0.001).  Descriptive statistics by tertiles of adherence to the FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) (Table 2), showed that in the highest tertile (T3) there was a higher contribution of antioxidant foods (vegetables, fruit-juices, olive oil, coffee, and tea), while lower in the case of pro-oxidant foods (biscuits and pastries, oils and fats, snacks, and sauces). The mean scores varied from 43.5 points to 57.3 points across the tertiles.",049c50f4-1d2c-46f8-b0d7-5916381bba71
34,methods34," Dietary intakes of nutrients and foods of the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) by tertiles of adherence to these scores are shown in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6. Dietary antioxidant components increased significantly from the first to the third tertile, whereas an opposite trend was seen for the pro-oxidant components.  Overall, similar results were seen in the simplified versions of the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s (data not shown). The distribution of the components and Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s were also very similar in the subsample of 210 subjects (data not shown).  3.2. Correlations between the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s, the MD Adherence Scores and the Biomarkers  Figure 1 shows the strength of the association between the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s, the scores of adherence to the MD and the biomarkers, according to Spearman correlation analysis.",432ce784-f64c-40b7-8d69-b03237a212db
35,methods35," The NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and the FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and their simplified versions were positively correlated between each other (rho = 0.61 between the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and the LFood-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), and rho = 0.42 between the Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and the Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)), and were associated in a positive and statistically significant way with the majority of the MD scores (p-value < 0.05 for rho > 0.3), mainly with ITAMED MDPA02, PREDIMED, rMED, aMED, MDS95 and Lbas (rho = 0.4 to 0.7 for Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)), and negatively with the MDQI score (rho = −0.55 and −0.41 for Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), respectively). Correlations became less strong when Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) with lifestyle components were considered.",b57b0246-2ea7-4acc-b1e4-62b3233ffd7b
36,methods36," In fact, correlations with the MD scores were absent for the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) made up of lifestyle components only (L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)).  Within the subsample of 210 participants (Figure 2), correlations between the different Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) were also strong/moderate (rho for NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) = 0.71). Although the correlations were low, there were negative relations between the different Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and some biomarkers of inflammation (TNF-α and C reactive protein (CRP), rho = −0.3 to −0.4; PAI-I, rho = −0.2), while positive with adiponectin (rho = 0.3 to 0.4). With respect to nutrient antioxidants biomarkers, we observed positive modest correlations with Vitamin C and its derivatives (rho~0.3), trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) (rho~0.3), and ORAC with proteins (rho~0.2). A negative correlation, through weak, emerged with total polyphenols (rho~−0.2).",cfbd40a4-723c-4db9-94a5-afbbe1b05ade
37,methods37," Null correlations were seen for other biomarkers. Interestingly, the above correlations were present for all the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s. It is also remarkable that the L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), i.e., the lifestyle Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) without dietary factors, correlated more strongly with the inflammation makers (e.g., rho = 0.4 with adiponectin), whereas correlations with antioxidant nutrient makers seemed to be weaker and even tended to be negative with the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assays.  3.3. Linear Relationships between the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s, the MD Adherence Scores and the Biomarkers  Table 3 shows results from the multivariate linear regression analysis on the association between the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and the MD adherence scores adjusted for age, sex center, and energy intake. Concerning the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), all associations were positive and statistically significant (p < 0.",db01dabc-6541-4323-bf5d-7b17e51dabf7
38,methods38,"001, after multiple testing correction); i.e., per one-unit increase in the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) scoring, there was a significant increase in the adherence of the MD, the average increase being 0.02 points (on the log scale). The largest increases in MD adherence were observed for: aMED (β = 0.062), rMED (β = 0.023), MDQI (β= −0.023), MDS2013 (β = 0.029), MDS1995 and MDScale2003 (β = 0.03), shortMedQ (β = 0.024), MMD2005 (β = 0.028) and ITAMED (β = 0.028). Parellel to these associations, the percentage of the variance (i.e., the R2) that the independent variables (NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and covariates) explained was higher than 15% for some MD scores (rMED, shortMedQ, PREDIMED, MDPA2002, MDQI and MedDietScore). This proportion of the variance ranged from 6% (MedDietScore) This proportion of the variance ranged from 6% (MSDPS)) to 51% (MDPA2002) in the most adjusted model. Adjustment for energy intake in Model 2 was almost negligible.",bed3d701-78f0-4184-8705-41b110a4bc09
39,methods39," When exploring FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and MD scores relations (Table 3), we observed similar results. As shown in Supplementary Tables S7 and S8, when the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) were restricted to lifestyle (L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)) or the dietary components (Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) or Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)), we found that the L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) was not consistently associated with the MD scores (p-values > 0.05 for rMED, MDS2013, MEDLIFE and others). In MD scores where associations reached statistical significance, the associations with the L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) were much weaker compared to those observed for the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) or FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS).",8d0a59a0-b09b-4f3a-9fa8-4f9a63c5ea02
40,methods40," By contrast, the associations with the MD scores turned stronger for the Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and the Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), the latter showing more notable associations (for example, β = 0.027 with shortMedQ in Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and β = 0.043 with shortMedQ in Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)). Overall, the effect of the adjustment for energy intake on the associations was also minor. Adjustment for Body mass index (BMI), PA and smoking status did also not affect the β coefficient in these models.  Table 4 shows results regarding associations between NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) with the biomarkers in the subsample. Similarly, Table 5 and Supplementary Table S9 show these associations concerning the simplified versions of these Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s (Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)).",58bb307d-2cb1-4efb-9f1b-853758294be5
41,methods41," These results refer to the biomarker imputed data, i.e., missing values were replaced by the substituted ones. Higher NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) punctuations were associated with higher plasma levels (on the log scale) of β-carotene and of ascorbic acid (per one-unit increase in Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS): β = 0.02; p-value = 0.01, and β = 0.012; p-value = 0.02, respectively). In the same way, there was a positive association between the FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and ascorbic acid (β = 0.015; p-value = 0.008). Rather, there was a tendency towards an association between the FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) with this and other nutrient antioxidant markers (for example, with retinol). Another striking finding was the inverse association between both NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) with C reactive protein (CRP) (per one-unit increase in both Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS): β= −0.02; p-value = 0.02).",f0416e8c-8e98-45b1-9eb8-f689524dfc5a
42,methods42," While these associations did not meet the Bonferroni corrected p-value threshold (p = 0.002), these results sustain that a more pro-antioxidant state according to the DL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) is related to a higher antioxidant status. Surprisingly, there were also significant inverse associations between the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) with total polyphenols and uric acid, but these associations were not maintained after correction for multiple testing.  Concerning the associations between Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) with the biomarkers (also on the log scale) (Table 5), we observed a trend towards positive associations between the Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and ascorbic acid in plasma (p-value = 0.05), as well as with β-carotene (p-value = 0.1).",babf8e39-341e-470f-a4bf-7021cea2f319
43,methods43," Associations were statistically significant between the Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) with ascorbic acid and total vitamin C (per one-unit increase in Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS): β = 0.017; p-value = 0.018, and β = 0.017; p-value = 0.038, respectively). Adjustment for energy intake (model 1 vs. model 2) did also not have a notable influence on the estimates (data not shown). Interestingly, there was no association between these Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s and C reactive protein (CRP), suggesting that the removal of lifestyle components from these Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) led to this lack of association. Adjustment for lifestyle factors in model 3, indeed, did not affect the estimates (β coefficients) when compared to those derived from model 2. Moreover, the multivariate regression analyses between the L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) (i.e.",83370722-91b5-4416-a78f-cf2bbd986412
44,methods44,", the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) made up of lifestyle factors only) and the biomarkers (Supplemental Table S7) revealed a strong inverse association between this Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and C reactive protein (CRP) and PAI-I; per one-unit increase in L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), these markers decreased on average (on the log scale) by 0.35 (p-value < 0.001) and 0.13 (p-value = 0.02), respectively. The proportion of variance explained by the predictors was also relatively high for this two markers (16–23%). However, opposite to what had been expected, negative associations were observed between this L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and retinol, uric acid and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) (with and without uric acid).",5a596ccb-6f69-47f2-b6b5-d08895943eea
45,methods45," While associations between these simplified Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) versions (Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)) and the nutrient antioxidant markers did not remain statistically significant after multiple testing correction, statistical significance was kept after this correction for the inflammation marker C reactive protein (CRP).  3.4. Stratified and Sensitivity Analyses  We did not observe statistically significant interactions by sex (p-value = 0.30 for NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), for example) or center (p-value = 0.11 for DL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), for example). As a consequence, no changes in the results were observed in stratified analyses by these variables (data not shown). In analyses excluding influential values, prone to be outliers, results were also almost unchanged (data not shown).",288ca41f-1a52-40ed-ae12-21d4d3820dd6
46,methods46," Results obtained in the multivariate regression analyses were similar when considering the unimputed biomarker data (data not shown). As shown in the correlation analyses, results derived from the imputed data (Supplementary Figure S1) was similar to those obtained from the complete data. Overall, similar results were obtained in these multivariate analyses when considering the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) in tertiles as predictor variable (data not shown).  4. Discussion  In this study we propose two novel Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s that are based on dietary and lifestyle factors (the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)) and some simplified versions thereof (the Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)).",68f8441d-708c-4b3a-90e0-b41b26677554
47,methods47," The NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) implemented dietary and lifestyle components that were already considered in Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s developed by others, and few new components related to OS that had thus far not been considered (for example, excess energy intake relative to the requirements, dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and the Polyphenol Antioxidant Content (PAC) score). We also propose a novel food-based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), based on 11 anti- and pro-oxidant-like foods, to facilitate the assessment of the individual´s oxidative/antioxidant balance. Both Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s were correlated with scores of adherence to the MD and with some biomarkers of nutrient antioxidants, inflammation and OS.",beff1421-e71b-46cf-ab33-e39864a1ec3c
48,methods48," More specifically, increasing scores in NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) were both associated with increasing levels of certain nutrient antioxidants (ascorbic acid and Vitamin C), and with decreasing levels of inflammation markers such as C reactive protein (CRP). An important finding to be highlighted is that the latter association seemed to be driven by the lifestyle components of these Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s.  Earlier Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) reported in the literature included some relevant dietary and lifestyle factors related with OS [22]. Among them, few antioxidant and pro-oxidant factors were considered [24,49]. Further adaptations of these Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s led to the inclusion of more factors [50,51]. However, improvements of these Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s in order to better capture the oxidative/antioxidant balance can still be considered.",bce61f7d-4306-48cb-9863-780bb43f2edb
49,methods49," In this study we proposed to consider dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC), taking into account that total antioxidant capacity (TAC) provides a holistic measure of the pool of antioxidants in the diet [19]. In fact, high dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) has been associated with reduced mortality and lower risk of developing diseases [22,52,53,54,55] Specifically, two total antioxidant capacity (TAC) methods (ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP)) were included in the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) so as to account for two different antioxidant mechanisms (proton or electron transfer). On the other hand, we also considered the Polyphenol Antioxidant Content (PAC) score, another measure of the global dietary intake of flavonoids and lignans [30].",7aa54885-2d1c-474a-b625-70e87a915045
50,methods50," Polyphenols have potential health benefits thanks to their association with OS, mostly by increasing the expression of antioxidant enzymes, by combating inflammation and by inhibiting cytotoxicity through intracellular regulation of calcium [56]. Also, we accounted for heme iron intake, which has been rarely considered in Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s, despite its well-recognized pro-oxidant potential [57]. The rationale for the inclusion of other nutrient antioxidants (Vitamin C, retinol, etc.) in the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s has been provided in Hernández–Ruiz et al. 2019 [22]. Overall, our Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) incorporated in total eight dietary nutrient components.",83b31720-39e2-4a1b-aa6a-73c47f9f779f
51,methods51,"  In addition, six lifestyle components were considered, including those previously proposed by others [22]: PA, which is known to increase the adaptive response to OS by activating cellular antioxidant signaling systems [13,58], alcohol, which increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by oxidizing ethanol to acetaldehyde [16,59], obesity, in terms of Body mass index (BMI), or WC, given its link with OS through lipid peroxidation processes [7], and tobacco consumption, which not only triggers oxidative imbalance between cell tissues, but also decreases the concentrations of some antioxidants in plasma while increasing inflammatory markers in blood and tissues [60]. We included Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) to focus on both general and visceral obesity. In our Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), we included additionally the estimated excess energy intake, i.e.",fed77d62-5c0c-44c3-b42a-3e9db57a51e6
52,methods52,", the difference between energy intake and the individual’s energy requirements according to the basal metabolic rate and PA level. Indeed, an excessive energy intake contributes to the increase of OS since it triggers cellular stress [10]. Also, numerous experimental studies (in animals) have shown that caloric restriction reduces the risk of developing diseases associated with the aging process, or metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus [61,62,63].  Our study makes an important contribution to the development of Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) by creating one of the first food-based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS). In the choice of foods as components of our Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS), their contribution to the dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) has been considered from published total antioxidant capacity (TAC) values of 210 foods [18,37], and other sources, as detailed in Supplementary Table S2.",d1810d22-a434-4563-ba9f-6c9ad7105a34
53,methods53," The degree of antioxidant or pro-oxidant potential of every food was considered. Therefore, some food components scored half as compared to other components. This consideration was taken into account to give the maximum score (positive or negative) to the components related to the intake of vegetables, fruits and juices, coffee and tea, meat and meat products. Due to low consumption patterns of some foods, we did not consider in this Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) consumption of nuts, whole grains or sweetened beverages, despite their high antioxidant or pro-oxidant capacity. To the best of our knowledge, in a recent study, a food-based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) was proposed by accounting for the intake of 18 foods related to OS in a positive or negative manner [64]. Our food-based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) contains 11 food components as several foods were grouped into certain components, to make its implementation easier.",985ee9ed-506b-4bb2-b6f5-edf536df8f69
54,methods54," This lifestyle and food-based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) also showed associations with nutrient antioxidant and inflammation makers, demonstrating likewise its capacity to assess the individual´s oxidative/antioxidant balance.  In the development of these Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s we almost invariably applied equal weights to the components for the scoring. Studies that have adopted different weighting criteria to develop an Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) (for example, the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)-Bayesian) showed similar results in studies addressing associations between these Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s and disease risk [37,52,53]. The development of a biomarker-based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) could better reflect the individual oxidative status. However, its use requires biomarker measurements in biological samples, which entails a high cost.",95a66a10-4909-4824-a610-c606e9bd74b6
55,methods55," Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s based on dietary components estimated from diet questionnaires could also reflect antioxidant status, provided that they show a relationship with antioxidant and OS markers. Based on this, several Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s have been validated in other studies concerning inflammation biomarkers [65,66,67] (for example, PCR) and OS [52,65,68] (for example, F2-isoprostanes, FIP). Recently, an Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) combining dietary and lifestyle factors weighted by associations with FIP, or unweighted, was also associated with this marker within the MAPI and MAPII study [64]. Together, these studies have demonstrated that well-defined Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) adequately reflect the individual oxidative/antioxidant balance. In this study, a validation study of our Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s was also carried out.",55beee1b-c6e3-40a4-ad0b-9c21dd065ee5
56,methods56," Our results also support that increasing Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s scorings are related to higher levels of ascorbic acid and to lower inflammation levels of C reactive protein (CRP), mainly. Ours is the first study showing associations between an Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s with nutrient antioxidants and inflammation markers, that may be driven by dietary factors in the first case, and by lifestyle factors in the second. However, we did not observe associations with other biomarkers, such as plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC). To date, it is unclear whether blood total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels are truly related to dietary intake of total antioxidant capacity (TAC). In fact, we have previously shown that there is a moderate positive correlation between diet and plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) [69].",75196b05-1a5c-4e6a-9432-6960fd6af091
57,methods57," The unexpected negative relations between the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and uric acid, total polyphenols and other total antioxidant capacity (TAC) measures were likely false and due to multiple testing problems. Another possible reason might be the influence of the enzymatic activity of the endogenous antioxidant defense system on these associations, for which we lacked information. In relation to uric acid we did not find a relationship with any of our Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s, despite the recognized antioxidant power of this compound. Uric acid is a marker of OS according to findings of several studies showing that elevated uric acid levels in blood are associated with significantly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels [70,71]. On the other hand, uric acid at high levels or in certain media may have pro-oxidant properties [72]. This pro-oxidant nature could explain the inverse association between the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) with uric acid in our study.",02719ab7-59e5-43f0-8810-77da3cbae9bf
58,methods58," Higher Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s scores, however, showed positive trends towards higher levels of other antioxidant nutrients in plasma samples. These associations were not robust, possibly owing to the low bioavailability of these nutrients or the high inter-individual variability in measurements, amongst others. As has been reported in validation studies of dietary questionnaires, there is a moderate correlation between dietary intake of vitamin C and plasma levels of this vitamin, and a weak or no correlation for other vitamins [27]. The limited statistical power to observe these associations might have also affected these results.  Regarding the biomarker validation study using inflammatory markers, as aforementioned, we found inverse associations with C reactive protein (CRP), supporting that high Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s (towards more antioxidant states) can lower the levels of this marker.",26d26fed-ff47-4e77-b2eb-fd346a985a6f
59,methods59," C reactive protein (CRP) is a widely studied biomarker of inflammation concerning CVD and other diseases related to inflammation and oxidative status [73]. No associations were found between the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) with the other markers, except a positive tendency with adiponectin, a commonly used biomarker of obesity. In our study sample, for example, WC was negatively correlated with this marker, though moderately (rho = −0.34). We might have not observed an association due to this apparently low effect size or other issues. Adiponectin, produced by adipocytes, generates adipocytokines, which play a crucial role in metabolic and cardiovascular homeostasis. It is inversely related to OS and chronic inflammation, particularly with cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-alpha or IL-6 [74,75,76]. Therefore, it is likely that we did not observe associations with other makers.",53f63e1c-20c2-4cb8-a75d-bae7d34574bf
60,methods60," While there may be differences in the adiponectin/leptin relationship with obesity according to sex [77], no sex-modifying effects were observed in the associations evaluated.  The validation study of the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s developed in our study also comprised an examination of their relation with 20 scores of adherence to the MD [29]. Our Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s were positively associated with all MD indexes, which supports that these Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s also characterize an antioxidant-rich dietary pattern. The associations were stronger regarding some MD scores, suggesting that, while all DM indices evaluate the same diet pattern, there are not only differences in their antioxidant profile [29], but also in their association with the individual oxidative balance.",dc515664-98e7-4d27-a3f3-bd13f5eac262
61,methods61," It should be noted that these associations were most notable in Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s that do not include lifestyle factors (Nutrient-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and Food-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)), and absent for the L-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS). This could be because MD score only include dietary components. However, in analyses controlling for lifestyle factors (PA, smoking habits, and Body mass index (BMI)), we obtained similar positive associations between the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s and the MD scores.  Regarding limitations of this study, it is important to note that some nutrient components, such as selenium, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, lycopene and lutein have not been included due to the lack of information on these components in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-EPIC nutrient database project (ENDB) database.",a70d5798-1e50-495e-8a4e-c2cf87397330
62,methods62," Nor have the medication components such as aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or nutrient supplement intakes, been considered due to the lack of information in a large part of the study population. Also, the biomarker study might have been underpowered to observe robust associations between the Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and markers. We must also note that this study did not cover relevant biomarkers of OS or those of the endogenous antioxidant defense system. Besides, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain study counts with dietary data collected by means of a diet history questionnaire.",2b533883-152b-43ac-9083-7bc119b000a8
63,methods63," While this method accounts for usual dietary intake that might not reflect immediate antioxidant intake, we have previously that shown dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assessed by this and other dietary assessment methods (24-h recall and FFQ) is similarly correlated to the non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity of the body that helps to relief the body from OS [21,69]. Among the strengths, it is important to highlight that we considered anthropometric parameters and information on PA i, that were measured in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study according to standard protocols. Ours is the first study showing associations between a priori defined Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s combining nutrient, foods and lifestyle components with a wide range of MD scores and biomarkers of nutrient antioxidants, inflammation and OS.",b7faf817-5092-47cf-a5e6-3ec0d2e4ec60
64,methods64," Moreover, our findings support that the different Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) link well to antioxidants in the diet and in the body, as well as to some inflammation-related markers, which validates their use for oxidative/antioxidant balance assessment. We were able to control for the influence of lifestyle factors on the associations, ruling out, to the extent possible, potential residual confounding on the studied associations. We had also extensive and high quality information on dietary intake of foods and nutrients, that allowed us to derive dietary factors such as the Polyphenol Antioxidant Content (PAC) scores and dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC), for their inclusion in the different Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s.",6639ae73-223b-4bab-98ca-e65f9aeac440
65,methods65," Finally, we have explored in depth how nutrient and food-based Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) with lifestyle factors, and their simplified versions as only nutrient, food or lifestyle components, are related to variables of the individual´s oxidative and antioxidant status.  5. Conclusions  The current study proposes two new Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s (the NutrientL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS) and FoodL-Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)) that incorporate diet, lifestyle and food dimensions in a single score. Both Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s are easy-to-implement due to their simplicity, and both can be considered valid tools to assess the individual´s oxidative/antioxidant balance, given their association with antioxidant-rich dietary patterns and with some biomarkers of nutrient antioxidants and inflammation.",126ddbe6-4d82-40f2-9dca-7c822f6cebb0
66,methods66, Our study also supports that Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s need to rely on both dietary and lifestyle components in order to reflect the oxidative/antioxidant state of an individual. The proposed Oxidative Balance Scores (OBS)s might be useful for future studies seeking to assess associations between OS induced by dietary and lifestyle factors and risk of developing diseases. ,381fff2d-3851-4384-b050-59187870458b
