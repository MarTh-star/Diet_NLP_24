0,methods0," Study Design  We conducted a cross-sectional study on patients recruited at the International Center for the Assessment of Nutritional Status (International Center for the Assessment of Nutritional Status (ICANS)), a nutritional outpatient clinic of the University of Milan that started its clinical activity in 2003. The promotion of the clinical activity took place, initially, through the use of flyers and newspaper advertisement, and then through a web page. Patients came to International Center for the Assessment of Nutritional Status (ICANS) on a voluntary basis or sent by their general practitioner or a specialist. The objective was to perform a nutritional assessment aimed at obtaining a personalized dietary program for weight loss and/or improvement of metabolic parameters, or to perform specific instrumental and/or laboratory evaluations.",9cff9921-fbce-4209-ac28-44253d083036

Therefore, we excluded 507 women who had performed only specific instrumental and/or laboratory evaluations, and 135 women who did not complete (≥1 item missing) the dietary screener for the assessment of the adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The characteristics of excluded women are given in Supplementary Table 1. Women included in the study were significantly younger, especially compared with women excluded because they had one or more missing items in the MEDiterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire. The latter had less fat free mass (fat free mass (FFM)) and greater abdominal visceral fat (visceral (VAT)) thickness, as well as being less educated.",baa4cd4c-8f5a-440f-9697-bcd00ab957c2

Measurements  On arrival at International Center for the Assessment of Nutritional Status (ICANS), the patients completed a short questionnaire investigating socio-demographic information. Between 08:30 and 09:00 AM, a physician took a blood sample from the fasting patient. The sample was then centrifuged and an aliquot of serum was used for the determination of blood glucose, triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol. The above biochemical parameters were measured by enzymatic method (Cobas Integra 400 Plus, Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland).",59fc6070-b5ca-4b2b-a52c-7a3695d11750

Menopause has been defined as the absence of a menstrual cycle for at least 12 months. The physician performed an ultrasound measurement of abdominal visceral and subcutaneous (subcutaneous (SAT)) fat using a Logiq 3 Pro instrument equipped with a 7.5 MHz linear probe and with a 3.5 MHz convex-array probe (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, United States). The measurements were taken 1 cm above the umbilicus at the end of expiration. subcutaneous (SAT), measured with the 7.5 MHz linear probe, was defined as the distance between the epidermis and the external face of the rectus abdominis muscle; visceral (VAT), measured with the 3.",be805dbd-81e1-469b-8aa1-d29aa6bfcadb

The physician then performed systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements in accordance with JNC-7 guidelines (31).  A registered dietician took the anthropometric measurements according to international guidelines (32) and performed body composition assessment by bioelectric impedance. Weight was taken with an electronic scale and rounded to the nearest 100 g (Seca 700 balance, Seca Corporation). Height was measured with a vertical stadiometer with an accuracy of 0.1 cm.

Participants stood on the scale platform of the instrument and grasped the handles of the device, to provide contact with a total of eight electrodes (two for each foot and for each hand). Manufacturer’s equations were used to estimate total body fat and fat free mass (FFM). All measurements were taken with the patient wearing only light clothes.  Outcome Assessment  The diagnosis of metabolically healthy (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) was made using the harmonized criteria proposed by Lavie et al. (34) (Table 1). Briefly, a women was classified as metabolically healthy (MHO) if she met no criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS), with the exclusion of high WC. Conversely, a women was classified as metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) if she met 1 to 4 MetS criteria (WC excluded).",2ce03a3e-88d8-446e-9858-2bf73b2d9460

19,discussion0," In this study, the adherence to the Mediterranean diet was favorably associated with metabolic phenotype of obesity in older women. More specifically, the adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower likelihood of metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) in postmenopausal women, independent of wide range on known confounders. Moreover, the result appears robust, such that sensitivity analysis did not show major losses of statistical significance regarding the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and metabolic health in postmenopausal women. Only when we included women with missing information on body composition and abdominal fat distribution, the association was marginally lost. However, in the latter case we had to remove these important confounders from the analysis, and this may explain the marginal loss of significance.  Metabolically healthy obesity is a phenotype of obesity characterized by the absence of metabolic alterations.",3be87d5c-f19d-4cc5-ba61-46d01db1d2cf
20,discussion1," In agreement with previous epidemiological studies, approximately one in five obese women in our sample had this metabolic phenotype (9, 13), but the prevalence was influenced by age. Our results confirm the differences in body composition and adipose tissue distribution between the two metabolic phenotypes of obesity (15). Women with the healthy phenotype had higher fat free mass (FFM) and ultrasound-estimated subcutaneous (SAT), whereas women with the unhealthy phenotype had greater amount of fat mass and ultrasound-estimated visceral (VAT). Previous epidemiological studies report similar caloric and nutrient intakes, as well as equal consumption of different food groups, among metabolically healthy (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) individuals (40–42). However, studying the dietary pattern may better inform the holistic effect of diet on healthy obesity (42).",93232345-980f-468c-b7a7-b9baa83365d3
21,discussion2," Assessment of dietary patterns avoids potential confounding with other aspects of the diet, increases the ability to assess stronger effects due to the cumulative effects of many dietary characteristics, and allows assessment of the interaction between synergistic components (43–46). Indeed, current evidence, although still limited, suggests that adherence to high-quality dietary patterns, may positively affect the metabolic phenotype of obesity (47). Our results confirm this evidence, suggesting (1) that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower risk of metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO), (2) that the effect of dietary pattern might be greater, with regard to obese women, in postmenopausal women, and (3) that the contribution of the Mediterranean diet to metabolic health is independent of body composition and abdominal fat distribution.",852bfe75-5cfb-4fc4-8e08-7573d1884bda
22,discussion3," In a previous study where a group of pre- and post-menopausal women underwent dietary intervention to lose weight, both groups had significant body weight loss, but only the postmenopausal women had an improvement in MetS parameters (48). In younger women, the protective action of estrogen may reduce the contribution of diet to metabolic health. Estrogen drives fat accumulation in gluteofemoral adipose tissue rather than visceral adipose tissue (49, 50), and gluteofemoral adipose tissue is thought to be protective against the negative effects of obesity (51). Estrogens also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, as they reduce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, and increased resistance to oxidative stress (50, 52). Consistent with these findings, when compared with postmenopausal women, premenopausal women have been found less insulin resistance (52). The protective effect is lost with the withdrawal of estrogen after menopause.",df25001e-3d58-490d-ba1f-fbfe8d58cb51
23,discussion4," As a consequence, fat accumulation in visceral adipose tissue increases, as does the risk of developing insulin resistance and CVD (52). It is therefore possible that when estrogen protection is lost, diet becomes more relevant. An alternative explanation could be related to the low adherence to the Mediterranean diet observed in younger women. This finding confirms the abundant evidence showing that younger segments of the population are abandoning the Mediterranean dietary pattern in favor of the less healthy, but more appealing, Western dietary patterns (38, 53).  Our results find consistency in a cohort study conducted within the PREDIMED trial, where greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, assessed through the MEDiterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) screening tool, was associated with transition to the healthy obesity phenotype in men and women aged 55 years and older (54).",3030d2ba-036e-49db-8432-8236ae4337ad
24,discussion5," In contrast, they differed from the results of a previous cross-sectional study, where a higher Mediterranean diet score was associated with a higher likelihood of metabolically healthy (MHO) in men aged <45 years and pre-menopausal women, but not in the older age groups (55). The discrepancy could lie in the different assessment tool for dietary habits, in the intrinsic differences in the studied populations (American population vs. Mediterranean population), as well as in the different definition of metabolically healthy (MHO). The lack of universally recognized criteria to define metabolically healthy (MHO) makes it difficult to compare studies. The criteria proposed by Lavie et al. (34) and that we used in the present study are based on the harmonized criteria for the diagnosis of MetS (56), parameters that are readily available and widely used in rutinary clinical practice and research, making our findings, in fact, more easily comparable.",836862fd-8eca-4681-8206-7b2cbc3990c3
25,discussion6," Moreover, they define the metabolically healthy (MHO) phenotype as free of metabolic alterations. The presence of even a single metabolic alteration is instead to be considered at risk of cardiovascular event, as the latter increases progressively with the number of metabolic alterations (57).  Several beneficial effects attributable to the Mediterranean diet could explain its role in promoting metabolic health. It has been reported from both prospective cohort studies and intervention trials how the Mediterranean diet, even in the absence of energy restriction, prevent weight gain (19, 21–23). In addition, several evidences suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean diet reduces liver fat content (58, 59), and, thereby, improves glucose and lipid metabolism, and, also via regulation of hepatokine release, impacts on the cardiometabolic risk (60).",048fbca1-1db0-41ce-ae2c-92113b940d07
26,discussion7," Finally, several bioactive compounds introduced by following a Mediterranean diet, such as polyphenols, mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, micronutrients and antioxidants, contribute to metabolic health by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation (61, 62). On the other hand, it is presumable that women with lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet followed a diet that was higher in high-calorie foods of low nutritional quality. This may have contributed to a higher intake of refined carbohydrates and sugars, saturated fat, salt and additives, and a lower intake of fiber and micronutrients, promoting visceral fat accumulation (54) and a low-grade inflammatory state (63, 64), risk factors for developing insulin-resistance (65).  Several strengths characterize the present study. First, the large sample size.",4c46e594-4cea-4d24-a005-4abe4c3ad4a5
27,discussion8," Second, we were able to control for a wide range of confounders, including body weight and composition, estimates of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat, education and marital status, assumed to be proxies for socioeconomic status and access to health care, family history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, menopausal status and lifestyle. All variables known to influence metabolic status.  We are well aware, however, that the study is not without limitations. First, the cross-sectional design does not allow for a cause-effect relationship. Second, we included only women. Third, we used a short dietary screener to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet, so a limited number of foods were considered. However, the questionnaire was shown to have a good agreement with Mediterranean diet adherence estimated by a FFQ (35). Fourth, the use of a self-completed dietary questionnaire may have been difficult for older, less educated women to understand, causing selection bias.",19a98694-5a81-4fd5-8864-c05a970def16
28,discussion9," However, exclusion of these women did not appear to affect the association between Mediterranean diet and metabolic health. Fifth, the use of non-gold-standard techniques for the assessment of body composition and abdominal adipose tissue distribution calls for caution in the interpretation of results. To this should be added that no comparison with reference methods was made in this study. In fact, we used bioelectrical impedance, which, although widely used in clinical settings, provides an estimate of the amount of fat free mass (FFM). We also performed an estimation of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue by ultrasonography, which, although some published works show good correlation between ultrasound thicknesses of visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) and the respective areas measured by computed tomography and MRI (29, 66), is not the reference technique for the evaluation of abdominal adipose tissue distribution.",8ee50801-c726-4993-95aa-f119dac66935
29,discussion10," Sixth, our study included only Caucasian women, and, therefore, these findings cannot be transferred to women of other ethnicities without a prior confirmation. Seventh, the use of hormone replacement therapy in the years after menopause may have influenced the risk of metabolic alterations. Finally, as in any observational study, potential residual confounding could not be ruled out.  Conclusion  In conclusion, adherence to the Mediterranean diet in obese women is associated with a better metabolic health. The contribution of diet seems to be more relevant in postmenopausal. Further prospective epidemiological studies and clinical trials are needed to confirm that the Mediterranean diet may promote maintenance of the healthy metabolic phenotype and reversion from the unhealthy phenotype.
