2,methods2," Study Selection  The criteria for including studies were as follows: (i) study design: prospective studies from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) project; (ii) any of the following exposures: food intake/type of diet/nutrient levels/nutritional biomarkers/alcohol consumption; and (iii) outcome: incidence or mortality of colorectal, breast, prostate, or lung cancer. The criteria for excluding studies were as follows: non-eligible publication types, such as review articles, editorials, comments, guidelines, or case reports. No exclusion criteria were applied based on language or journal publication date. The titles, abstracts, and full texts were independently reviewed by 2 reviewers (E.U.-G. and A.C.-L.), and disagreements were solved by consensus or involving a third researcher.  2.3. Data Extration and Quality Assessment  The following data was extracted from the original reports: (1) first author and year of publication; (2) tumour site; (3) no.",d3175edd-bdac-4d35-8011-e824b398a46e

The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for Systematic Reviews (Table S2) [17] was used to evaluate the risk of bias for cohort studies as in previous cancer and diet reviews [18,19,20]. The assessed methodological criteria included 11 items, each of them with four possible answers: “yes” (criterion met), “no” (criterion not met), “unclear”, and “not applicable” (N/A). A study was considered as “high quality” when the quality score was at least 0.75 (i.e., 75%), whereas studies were considered as “low quality” when the quality score was lower than 0.75. In addition, a score for each criterion was calculated, by dividing the number of positively scored by the total number of included studies, to provide an overview of how well the current literature scores on each criterion.",d341ab6c-a5e6-4714-a0f9-d57c50c900f9
4,methods4,"  Data extraction and quality assessment were independently performed by two researchers, and inconsistencies were solved by consensus or involving a third researcher.  2.4. Data Synthesis  Due to the overlap of participants among studies, a quantitative meta-analysis was not undertaken. Therefore, the evidence was summarized qualitatively for each of the included cancer types (colorectal, breast, lung, and prostate cancer). The results are shown by type of cancer and grouped according to exposure type following the “Third Expert Report of Diet, Nutrition, Physical Activity and Cancer: a Global Perspective, from World Cancer Research Fund” [9].  3. Results  3.1. Study Quality  All 110 studies that entered the review (see Figure 1) were high quality studies according to the assessment tool for Systematic Reviews from The Joanna Briggs Institute [17].

5,methods5,"  When the studies were analysed by individual domains, 100% of the studies measured the exposure and the outcomes in a valid and reliable manner, identified the potential confounders and took them into account within the study design or in the data analysis, the participants were free of the outcomes of interest at the start of the study, the follow up was completed by a large percentage of participants, and the statistical analysis used was appropriate. It should be taken into account that, among the studies that had two groups, 44.7% had similar groups that were recruited from the same population, and 100% of those studies measured the exposures similarly in order to assign people to the exposed or unexposed groups. Most of the studies presented an appropriate length of time for follow up (93.6%). In no study was it necessary to apply strategies to address incomplete follow up.  3.2.",23a484cf-6699-4a4a-8a5f-0baf3a34e96c
6,methods6," Colorectal Cancer  We identified 43 studies on colorectal cancer (Table 1), with a mean follow-up of 9.2 ± 4.0 years.  Wholegrains, vegetables and fruit: A higher consumption of fruits and vegetables combined was related to a lower risk of colorectal cancer: HR 0.86 (0.75–1.00) [21], but no consistent associations were observed for separate consumption of fruits and vegetables [21,22]. Similar findings were observed for the association between fibre consumption and colorectal cancer: HR 0.58 (0.41–0.85) [23], HR 0.79 (0.63–0.99) [24], and HR 0.87 (0.79–0.96) per 10 g/day increase in fibre [25]. A protective effect was also observed between intake of nuts/seeds and the risk of colon cancer in women [26]: HR 0.69 (0.50–0.95), with no associations in men.  Meat, fish, dairy products, and preservation/processing of foods: Two studies showed a protective effect of fish intake on colorectal cancer: HR 0.88 (0.80–0.96) comparing the highest vs. lowest quintile [27], and HR 0.69 (0.54–0.",3f1a56ac-6a8c-4acf-a9c9-b2d680e5d646

The opposite was found with regards to meat consumption as an increase of red and processed meat consumption associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer: HR 1.55 (1.19–2.02) per 100-g increase [28]. Pre-diagnostic red meat, processed meat or fibre intakes were not associated with colorectal cancer mortality; however, a marginal trend of processed meat was detected [29]. With regards to calcium, dietary calcium intake was associated with a lower colorectal cancer risk: IRR 0.69 (0.50–0.96) [30], and HR 0.95 (0.91–0.99) per 200 mg/day [31]. There was also an association between milk consumption and colorectal cancer risk: HR 0.93 (0.89–0.98) per 200 g/day [31]. Finally, yogurt intake was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer: HR 0.65 (0.48–0.89) [32], and HR 0.65 (0.48–0.89) [33].",3deaf66b-4c66-4a3a-b67d-b01f8f17bbef
8,methods8,"  Diet patterns: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet [33], the Italian Mediterranean Index [34], and the Modified Mediterranean diet score (mMDS) [35] were found to protect against colorectal cancer with HR 0.54 (0.36–0.81), HR 0.50 (0.35–0.71), and HR 0.89 (0.80–0.99), respectively. In contrast, higher scores (lower nutritional quality diet) in the Food Standards Agency nutrient profiling system dietary index (FSA-NPS DI), and higher values in the Dietary inflammatory index (Dietary inflammatory index (DII)) were associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer: HR 1.11 (1.01–1.22) [36], and HR 1.15 (1.04–1.27) [37], respectively.  Alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks: Alcohol consumption was a risk factor for colorectal cancer in six studies [38,39,40,41,42,43]. Of note, a HR of 1.74 (1.08–2.80) was found among participants drinking >3 drinks/day versus those drinking <1 drink/day [38].",8cae4425-929c-47e7-85f1-fead5583f77f

A lower colon cancer risk was associated with a higher plasma retinol concentration and dietary b-carotene: IRR 0.63 (0.46–0.87), and OR 0.69 (0.52–0.94), respectively [48]. Dietary vitamin C and dietary vitamin E also protected against distal colon cancer (highest vs. lowest quartile): OR 0.60 (0.39–0.93), and OR 0.65 (0.42–0.99), respectively [48]. Finally, associations with colorectal cancer were also found for other variables such as plasma total alkyl-resorcinols [49], plasma methionine [50], plasma choline [50], fatty acids [51], glycaemic index [33], and concentration of zinc [52], among others.  nutrients-13-03582-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Evidence synthesis of the association between diet and colorectal cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study.

27,methods68," Discussion  Colorectal cancer: Several European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) studies have found protective effects against colorectal cancer risk of the following diet-related factors: consumption of fish, dietary fibre, fruits and vegetables, nuts/seeds, dietary calcium, milk, yogurt, circulating vitamin D concentration, plasma concentrations of vitamins B2 and B6, plasma retinol concentration, dietary b-carotene, dietary vitamin C, and dietary vitamin E. On the contrary, alcohol and red and processed meat consumption were associated with a significant increase in colorectal cancer risk. Adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet was strongly associated with a reduction of colorectal cancer risk, whereas higher FSA-NPS DI scores, i.e., lower nutritional quality of the diet, and higher Dietary inflammatory index (DII) scores, i.e., a more pro-inflammatory diet, were particularly associated with higher risks of cancer of the colon-rectum.",5342e196-42c4-4cb1-b8b8-0a6495ad201f
28,methods69," However, the associations for the Dietary inflammatory index (DII) scores were more evident in men and not significant in women. These sex-differences can be due to hormonal influences because oestrogen plays a key protective role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer in women [132]. Therefore, diet and hormonal components can affect colorectal cancer risk differently in women than in men [133].  The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study findings are in line with the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute of Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) latest report [9] that concluded that there is strong evidence to support that consuming foods containing dairy products, dietary fibre, and dietary calcium decreases the risk of colorectal cancer while consuming alcohol and red and processed meat increases it.",18296d38-4b5f-4ee9-b3c7-82f636fa206c
29,methods70," According to this report, there is also limited evidence supporting that the intake of fish, carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin D might decrease colorectal cancer risk; however, a recent mendelian randomisation study on vitamin D and risk of seven cancers concluded that there is limited evidence of a linear causal relationship between circulating vitamin D concentration and colorectal cancer risk [134]. Further, ingested red and processed meat is classified following the International Agency for Research on Cancer (International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)) as a probable human carcinogen (group 2A) and carcinogen to humans (group 1), respectively [135]. A current review of 45 meta-analyses also found convincing and biologically plausible evidence for the association between lower risk of colorectal cancer and higher dietary fibre intake, higher dietary calcium and yogurt intake, and lower alcohol and red meat intake [136].",92322559-07fc-4dcf-864a-30337e39e626
30,methods71," The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study findings appear to be in agreement with the latest systematic review from the WCRF and AICR [8] and a recent umbrella review of meta-analyses of prospective observational studies [136]. Hence, they largely support existing cancer prevention recommendations that advise increased fibre and dairy products intake and limited red meat and alcohol intake to reduce colorectal cancer risk.  Breast cancer: The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) results showed that intake of vegetables, fruits and vegetables, total dietary fibre, fibre from vegetables, and fatty fish protect against breast cancer, whereas no associations were found for fruit or fibre derived from fruit, cereals, or legumes. However, one study did not find associations between fruit or vegetable intake and breast cancer risk [68].",866ea0dc-d1a2-4202-bdb2-b99fd25345c2
31,methods72," Since these results were obtained during the first years of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), the relatively short follow-up might not best reflect the true association. Later, significant associations were found in longer follow-up studies [33,65,66,67]. Lower breast cancer risk was associated with adherence to a Mediterranean diet whereas diets with lower nutritional quality were associated with a higher risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Overall, stronger associations were found for progesterone-receptor–negative and oestrogen-receptor–negative cancer types for vegetable intake, fibre from vegetables, and Mediterranean diet. Conversely, alcohol intake clearly and strongly increased the risk of breast cancer regardless of the menopausal status. A diet rich in β-carotene, riboflavin, thiamine, folate, fibre, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, vitamins C and vitamin B6 protects against breast cancer.",f8ff041a-3f0f-4bfa-a14f-934f10f1644e
32,methods73," In addition, high saturated fatty acids intake, and high dietary glycaemic load were all significantly associated with a higher risk of breast cancer.  The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study findings are concordant with the WCRF/AICR third expert report [9] that concluded that there is strong evidence that consuming alcoholic drinks increases the risk of breast cancer both in pre- and postmenopausal women. According to the report, there is also some evidence that the consumption of non-starchy vegetables may reduce the risk of oestrogen-receptor–negative breast cancer; the consumption of foods containing carotenoids the risk of breast cancer in general; and the consumption of dairy products and diets high in calcium the risk of premenopausal breast cancer. The evidence available for the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer is more limited but points in the same direction.",57186044-b4d2-41f0-b1b1-8fbffd343a58
33,methods74," As seen in the results from the WCRF and AICR [9] and the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, the role of dietary factors in the development of breast cancer is not entirely resolved. Alcohol is the only established dietary risk factor, probably acting by increasing levels of endogenous oestrogen and other hormones associated with this cancer [137,138,139,140]. Findings from a recent systematic review of dietary patterns and breast cancer risk suggest that patterns including vegetables, red and processed meats, and that limit saturated fat may reduce breast cancer risk [141]. The association between saturated fat and breast cancer has been very controversial over the past years, with some studies such as European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) supporting a positive relationship [142,143] and others not finding enough evidence of a relationship [144,145].",9891e403-8b6c-4389-a667-54a5e9f77e82
34,methods75," More studies are needed to confirm these results and to identify the biological pathways that may be the reason for the association.  Lung cancer: The effect of diet on lung cancer has been investigated less in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, with only 11 studies reported since 2004. Results from European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) overall have shown that intake of fruit and vegetables protects against lung cancer. No consistent associations were found for meat and fish consumption. A lower nutritional quality of diet was associated with a higher lung cancer risk in men and women. On the other hand, a decreased risk of lung cancer was seen for high serum levels of B6 and methionine, even among former and current smokers. Along the same lines, dietary intake of vitamin C, vitamin K2 and haem iron were also associated with a lower risk of developing lung cancer.",6656f760-87cf-47fa-9425-22e42247af28
35,methods76,"  The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) results regarding vitamin C and fruit and vegetables intake are consistent with the epidemiological evidence moderately supporting a decrease in lung cancer risk [9,146,147,148]. The WCRF and AICR report also concluded that food and fruits containing retinol, β-carotene or carotenoids probably decrease the risk of lung cancer, while there is strong evidence that taking high-dose β-carotene supplements increases the risk in current and former smokers. Vegetable intake might also have a protective role in current and former smokers, but more evidence is needed, as well as for red and processed meat, alcoholic drinks, and isoflavones intake. The latest WRCF/AICR report also highlights the robustly convincing role that drinking water containing arsenic has in increasing the risk of lung cancer [9].",85a06488-984d-4f11-80ae-104a2b2da4fb
36,methods77," Unquestionably, more studies are warranted to explore these results, but since smoking is the main cause of lung cancer, the most effective measure of prevention among smokers remains to stop smoking.  Prostate cancer: European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) studies regarding prostate cancer and its relationship with diet have yielded controversial results. One study showed protective associations between consumption of fruits and prostate cancer [112], but no associations were observed with fruits or vegetables consumption in another study [111]. This may be also due to the relatively short follow-up in this later study. High total dietary calcium, intake of yoghurt, and calcium and protein from dairy products were significant associated with a moderate increase in risk of prostate cancer. However, there was no evidence of association with the intake of dairy products.",0c969130-fcb9-4a5d-b911-74f030992101
37,methods78," Results associated with diets rich in calcium are consistent with scientific evidence indicating that this association is likely [9]. Some evidence from the WCRF/AICR report also relates higher intake of dairy products, low plasma vitamin E, and low plasma selenium concentrations with an increase in the risk of prostate cancer [9]. No consistent associations were found in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study for diets with lower nutritional quality, fat from dairy products and fruit and vegetables combined consumption. Overall, in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, there were no associations of intake of dietary fibre, vitamin D, fish, dietary fat, alcohol, coffee, tea, and soft drinks, with the risk of prostate cancer.",4f25d467-2261-46fd-9424-8c3889bcb313
38,methods79," However, a higher risk of prostate cancer was observed with higher intake of alcohol among the O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (Methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)) gene Ile143Val polymorphism carriers of the variant genotype in comparison with the Methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) Ile143Ile common genotype with lower alcohol intake [53]. Two mendelian randomisation studies on alcohol intake and the risk of prostate cancer yielded inconsistent results [149,150].  Results from European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) might underestimate the role that diet may play in prostate carcinogenesis. Prostate cancer aetiology remains largely unknown and increasing evidence is being gathered supporting the relevant role of dietary factors in the disease [151,152].",744a7785-868e-45be-a734-2744e039c4e1
39,methods80," According to a recent review, consumption of trans and saturated fatty acids, and food products such as processed meat contributes to prostate carcinogenesis through the alteration of prostate hormonal regulation, the induction of oxidative inflammation and stress, and the alteration of growth factor signalling and lipid metabolism. Conversely, a high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grain products, and fish seem to exert protective and/or therapeutic effects [151].  Biological mechanisms believed to underlie the role of diet in carcinogenesis in general include cell-cycle regulation, growth factors (such as insulin and insulin-like growth factors), immunity, inflammation, and angiogenesis [3]. Fruits and vegetables are a rich source of vitamin C and E, folate, and selenium, which are related to anti-tumorigenic effects in different cells [153].",39df78ed-0125-43c5-a713-5c2be1579bbc
40,methods81," Potential mechanisms explaining the effects of red and processed meat on cancer risk include cooking at high temperatures, which results in mutagenic potential trough the formation of DNA adducts [9]; some DNA-damaging mechanisms associated with high haem iron intake [154], and the high salt content of processed meat that may produce damage to the stomach resulting in inflammation or atrophy [9], among others. Finally, drinking alcohol can be carcinogenic to some cell types and genotoxic due to ethanol [155,156], can interfere in DNA repair mechanisms [157], and produce changes in hormone metabolism [158]. The role of diet in the aetiology of cancer will continue to be investigated in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), also using tumour molecular pathology and omics research, including metabolomics, genetics, and the microbiome [3].",4ae7a28a-90c7-4c63-9fba-40e0b337675a
41,methods82,"  The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study findings have contributed to the WRCF/AICR recommendations about cancer prevention. In comparison with the previous review [8], this updated article shows European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) findings derived from longer follow-up studies that best reflect what is etiologically relevant. This review compiles novel and stronger evidence that confirms some weak associations described previously [8], such as the association of fruit and/or vegetables consumption with colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, or dietary fibre intake with colorectal cancer. In the past years, more evidence has accumulated about dietary patterns (for example, Mediterranean diet, lower nutritional quality diet or inflammatory score of the diet), and other dietary exposures such as nutritional biomarkers (for example, several vitamins, carotenes, or fatty acids).",99eaf60c-dabb-4ff4-a66c-98f5a9604dd7
42,methods83," New evidence has emerged regarding yogurt, milk, and soft drink consumption in relation to colorectal cancer risk; fatty fish and coffee intake and breast cancer risk; and yogurt and fat intakes with prostate cancer risk. Overall, this work adds ninety new published articles about colorectal, breast, lung, or prostate cancer. This reflects the remarkable increase in the available evidence from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study in the last ten years (n = 20 vs. n = 110).  The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study has been highly prolific and a major source of evidence regarding the aetiology of cancer and other chronic diseases.",d432c07c-dbab-42a9-b22d-06fd88c0d11b
43,methods84," The most relevant strengths of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study are its very large sample size, its prospective nature, the availability of blood samples to explore biomarkers, and the very comprehensive dietary questionnaires, from diverse European populations with different predominant dietary patterns and a wide variation in cancer incidence. Nevertheless, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study also has limitations that could affect its results. Like in most observational studies, our results are in partly based on self-reported data that may be subject to misclassification or measurement error in dietary intake.  5. Conclusions  The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study has resulted in numerous high-quality publications about the role of diet in cancer prevention that help inform public health recommendations, policies, and strategies.",6d41b170-7a2f-46eb-ac46-d6ee0173477d
44,methods85," Overall, fruit and vegetable consumption had a protective effect against colorectal, breast, and lung cancer, whereas only fruit had a protective effect against prostate cancer. A higher consumption of fish and lower consumption of red and processed meat were related with a lower risk of colorectal cancer; and higher consumption of fatty fish with lower risk of breast cancer. Calcium and yogurt intake were found to protect against colorectal and prostate cancer. Alcohol consumption increased the risk for colorectal and breast cancer. Finally, adherence to the Mediterranean diet emerged as a protective factor for colorectal and breast cancer.
