0,methods0,"The present study is a descriptive, quantitative, and cross-sectional research which followed the ethical standards defined by the Declaration of Helsinki (Hong Kong Review in September 1989 and Edinburgh 2000). It has been carried out in accordance with the recommendations for good clinical practices of the EC (Document 111/3976/88, July 1990). In order to meet the requirements for collecting data in the three participating cities, we needed the approval of the Ethics and Research Committee of Andalusia (Ref.: 0310-N-17), the National Bioethics Committee of Iceland (Ref.: VSNb2017030026/03.01) and the Ethics Committee of the University of Tartu, Estonia (Ref.: 281/T-10).  2.1. Study and Sample Design The participants were students (N = 1717, 52.41% boys; 47.59% girls) from 13 to 16 years old (14.94 ± 1.12), enrolled in secondary schools in Seville (Spain), Reykjavik (Iceland), and Tartu (Estonia).",c9eb18aa-61d7-480a-83f9-7249109c689f
1,methods1," For the selection of the sample, a 95% confidence interval and a 5% margin of error were applied.  2.2. Instruments The Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Questionnaire (KIDMED) had been previously validated in English and Spanish [18], and was handed to all the participants with statements in their mother tongue. For the Icelandic and Estonian versions parallel back-translation was used [20,21]. The KIDMED consists of 16 items (see Table 1). Twelve items represent a positive score for the adherence to the MD and the remaining 4 items represent a negative score. A positive answer to a question that involves greater adherence to the diet is worth +1 point. A positive answer to a question that means less adherence to the diet is worth −1 point. Negative answers do not score (a value of 0 is noted). The KIDMED index is the sum of all the scores and ranges from 0 to 12 points (minimum to maximum adherence to the MD).",b518f5df-388f-4792-9336-d7f897f0bc6b
2,methods2," The adherence to the MD was categorized as: low adherence (very low-quality diet, 0–3); medium adherence (improvement of the diet is needed, 4–7); and high adherence (ideal adherence to the MD, 8–12).  Alpha Fitness Battery Test (Alpha Fitness Battery Test (AFB)): The anthropometric variables of the participants (weight, height, body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI), fat percentage) and PF variables (cardiovascular endurance, upper body strength, lower body power, and speed/agility) were assessed using a modified version of the Extended Alpha fitness battery [22]. The measurement of the skin folds was omitted due to the limited time for carrying out the research and the large number of participants. Instead, a bioimpedance system (Tanita Inner Scan BF-689, Tanita, Tokyo, Japan) validated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for that type of population was used.",753816f0-457c-4af5-8ee9-650229e4abbd
3,methods3," When assessing PF and body composition parameters, the protocol established by the Alpha Fitness Battery Test (AFB) was followed at all times. All the instruments used, and the procedures followed can be found in Galan-Lopez et al. (2018, 2019) as part of a larger research project [23,24].  2.3. Methodology The measurements corresponding to the Alpha Fitness Battery Test (AFB) and the data collection with the KIDMED questionnaire were carried out during the participants’ physical education classes. The physical tests were organized consecutively in a circuit. The cardiovascular endurance test was carried out by several students at the same time. The preparation, implementation and completion of all tests including the KIDMED questionnaire lasted 90 min for each group/class of participants.  2.4.",fc1055eb-02d4-440a-99dd-f2767106618a
4,methods4," Statistical Analysis In order to present the data, percentages (%) and frequencies were used for the qualitative variables and the mean (M) ± standard deviations (SD) for the quantitative variables. After verifying the normality of the variables by the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test, the Student’s t-test for independent samples was conducted in order to analyze age, height, and weight and to check possible differences between the KIDMED scores in boys and girls with over waist circumference (Owaist), overfat (Ofat), and overweight (Oweight) and, without over waist circumference (N-Owaist), overfat (N-Ofat), and overweight (N-Oweight). Additionally, a Chi-square test was performed for analyzing the proportion of participants with and without Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight who responded ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the questions of the KIDMED questionnaire. Subsequently, to estimate the relative risk of responding positively to a risk factor in the questionnaire, an odd ratio (OR) was calculated.",e01c21a9-11f5-44dc-b5a0-23807203451b
5,methods5," To analyze the PF performance in boys and girls with and without Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight, the Student’s t-test for independent samples was performed. Since only European subjects took part in the present study and the Alpha Fitness Battery Test (AFB), developed and validated for European adolescent population was used, the different categories of waist perimeter, body fat percentage and body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI), were established based on the classification employed by the authors of the battery [25,26]. Cohen’s effect size (ES) was calculated to allow a better interpretation of the results related to these variables and the KIDMED index. The ES was considered as trivial (<0.2), small (0.2–0.5), moderate (0.5–0.8) and large (>0.8). The statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. All the statistical tests were performed using the software package SPSS version 24.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA, III).  3. Results 3.1.",29ad8872-4966-4a6f-809f-4bdc5fbc5355

In relation to weight, Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight, the participants of both genders showed significantly higher results than the N-Owaist, N-Ofat, and N-Oweight participants (p < 0.001; ES:1.40–2.10). Also, higher levels of body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001; ES: 1.83–2.98), body fat percentage (p < 0.001; ES: 1.73–3.38), and waist circumference (p < 0.001; ES: 1.85–2.84) were observed in Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight in comparison to the N-Owaist, N-Ofat, and N-Oweight subjects (see Figure 2).  3.2. KIDMED Index and Responses in Boys with and without Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight No statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in relation to the KIDMED index according to the different body composition criteria used (Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight) were found (see Table 2).",1c7414c6-ddd9-4b66-ab55-ce239f7e2515
7,methods9,"  Regarding the negative questions (−) (see Table 3), it was observed that skipping breakfast presented a higher value in participants with Owaist (p = 0.002), Ofat (p = 0.001), and Oweight (p = 0.001), considering this to be a risk factor for Owaist (OR = 1.48 (1.16–1.89)), Ofat (OR = 1.64 (1.24–2.16)), and Oweight (OR = 1.47 (1.19–1.83)) subjects. In addition, higher consumption of pastries and commercially baked goods for breakfast was found for the N-Owaist (p = 0.040), N-Ofat (p = 0.013), and N-Oweight (p = 0.025) participants, and a higher value for going to fast-food restaurants more than once per week in Oweight participants (p = 0.035). Finally, a higher consumption of sweets and candy several times per day was found in Ofat (p = 0.002).  3.3.",512baf22-ad16-4080-8c85-21dc5ccee317
8,methods10," KIDMED Responses in Girls with and without Owaist, Ofat and Oweight No statistically significant differences were observed for the girls in relation to the KIDMED index according to the different body composition criteria used (Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight (p > 0.05) (see Table 2). Regarding the positive (+) questions of the KIDMED questionnaire (see Table 4), N-Owaist (p = 0.022) and N-Oweight (p = 0.026) girls had a higher consumption of dairy products for breakfast, considering non-consumption to be a risk factor for Owaist (OR = 1.38 (1.06–1.80)) and Oweight (OR = 1.33 (1.05–1.68)). As for the boys, a higher consumption of almost daily rice or pasta (≥5 times per week) was observed in N-Owaist girls (p = 0.008), assuming this to be a risk factor for Owaist (OR = 1.49 (1.10–2.01)) if they did not consume them so frequently. Unlike what happened for Owaist boys, significant differences had been found for “second serving of fruit daily” with a higher consumption in Owaist (p = 0.",e466b8dd-c378-4917-810a-df4947f0da9e
9,methods11,"003), Ofat (p = 0.005) and Oweight girls (p = 0.034). So, not consuming a second serving of fruit daily implies a risk factor in the development of Owaist (OR = 0.68 (0.52–0.88)), Ofat (OR = 0.74 (0.61–0.91)), and Oweight (OR = 0.78 (0.62–0.98)) in girls. Also, there has been a tendency toward a greater intake of cereal or grains products for breakfast in N-Oweight girls (p = 0.066), increasing the risk of Oweight (OR = 1.26 (1.00–1.59)) if not consumed.  Regarding the negative questions of the questionnaire (−) (see Table 4), a lower intake of sweets and candy every day was observed in Owaist (p = 0.001), Ofat (p = 0.006), and Oweight girls (p = 0.006). Likewise, the N-Owaist and N-Ofat girls go less to fast-food restaurants in comparison to Owaist (p = 0.005) and Ofat (p = 0.030).  3.4. Fitness Performance in Boys and Girls with and without Owaist, Ofat and Oweight In handgrip performance, higher values for Ofat, Owaist, and Oweight (p < 0.",782b0ba6-7387-497b-9200-3eaab53929df
10,methods12,"05) were found except for the Ofat boys (p = 0.359) (see Table 5). The jump test showed a higher significant performance and a moderate effect size for N-Owaist, N-Ofat, and N-Oweight girls (p < 0.001; ES = 0.41–0.56), and moderate to large in the case of N-Owaist, N-Ofat, and N-Oweight boys (p < 0.001; ES = 0.65-0.94). In the case of the speed test, higher values have been verified with a moderate effect size for N-Owaist, N-Ofat, and N-Oweight girls (p < 0.05; ES = 0.45–0.54), and moderate and large values in boys (p < 0.001; ES = 0.57–0.92). Likewise, in cardiorespiratory fitness, N-Owaist, N-Ofat, and N-Oweight boys obtained a statistically superior performance with a large effect size (p < 0.001; ES = 0.83–1.08), while those statistically significant differences in girls had a moderate effect size (p < 0.001; ES = 0.47–0.50) (see Figure 3).  4. Discussion 4.1.",fc64dc5d-0f3b-4a75-ab50-02ea4ae743f4
11,methods13," Descriptive Data in Subjects with and without Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight Current data denote 124 million children and adolescents with adiposity (>5–19 years old). This number has increased tenfold in the last 30 years [3]. Obesity rates in adolescents of the countries participating in this study are 8.5% in Spain and Iceland and 5% in Estonia, as one of the countries with the lowest rate of obesity [3]. If we take into account the results regarding the body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI) of the overweight and obese subjects of the present sample, it can be seen how these are slightly higher than those obtained in studies with a similar population (27.04% vs. 21–23%) [27,28,29,30,31,32], although both are in line with the increase and prevalence of overweight and current obesity in the adolescent population [3].",315e1b68-0a8d-424d-aefa-00862b80fa22
12,methods14,"  Despite the widespread use of body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI) as an indicator of adiposity in the population, its correlation with body fat is relatively poor, given that it shows little sensitivity when determining the different deposits of fat, mainly abdominal, due to its extensive relationship with noncommunicable diseases like obesity [4]. In order to correct this aspect, the body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI) was complemented with the waist circumference and the body fat percentage. It can be observed how the results regarding waist circumference are similar to those obtained in various studies on European adolescent populations (21.51 cm vs. 21.1–21.7 cm) [27,28,31,33,34]. Regarding the percentage of body fat, the results show a great similarity with those obtained in several investigations (21.36% vs. 22–22.7%), although these were obtained by measuring the skin folds [28,29,33]. In addition, there is a higher Ofat rate in girls than boys.",a158fbde-0c90-4fde-a59a-8745107d760b
13,methods15," Although this aspect would need to be gone into more thoroughly, a possible cause could be a lower level of PA and a more sedentary lifestyle in girls at these ages [35,36].  It is worth highlighting the existence of significant differences in all the body composition variables for both genders in the Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight subjects in comparison to the N-Owaist, N-Ofat, and N-Oweight subjects. This supports the classification used in the present investigation.  4.2. KIDMED Index and Responses in Boys and Girl with and without Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight Adolescence is a key period in life, and it involves multiple physiological and psychological changes that affect nutritional needs and habits. Teenagers have different choices and eating habits compared to children and adults [37]. In this aspect, the MD is revealed to be an appropriate dietary pattern [17].",908fd8d2-a1b3-433c-a5ac-cbf0384f0ce2
14,methods16," Most recently reviewed studies conducted in southern European countries reported that approximately half the children and adolescents show a low adherence to MD [38]. The participants of the current study presented a medium level of adherence to the MD (5–6) [39]. These values corroborate the aforementioned and coincide with other, similar studies carried out in adolescents in southern Europe [40,41].  Recent research suggests that the main benefits derived from the implementation or monitoring of the MD translate into an improvement in body composition [42]. The answers to the positive (+) questions of the KIDMED and its relationship with the parameters of body composition according to sex show heterogeneity, though there are results that merit analyzing.",cadb6457-f341-4c61-adaf-b5c551fd6965
15,methods17," Thus, a greater consumption of rice or pasta, almost daily, (≥5/week) can be observed in N-Owaist individuals (boys and girls), N-Ofat (boys), and N-Oweight (boys), so not consuming them with that frequency could be a risk factor in this sample. As question Q8 does not discriminate between brown and refined rice or pasta, the results may lead to different interpretations. On the one hand, an excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates is negatively related to health and obesity [43,44,45,46] and, on the other hand, the consumption of wholegrain carbohydrates in adolescents is positively related to both [47,48,49,50].  When analyzing the N-Owaist participants, a higher regular fish consumption (2–3/week) is observed in boys and, a greater consumption of dairy products for breakfast in girls. So, not consuming them could be a risk factor in both cases. The consumption of fish and dairy products is a fundamental aspect in the MD [39].",ef515b9e-ba77-4ee4-9dc8-d117bf3817de
16,methods18," Numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses attribute a lower incidence of diseases and a better health to fish consumption [51,52], but few relate this to a better body composition in adolescents. Although the consumption of fish, together with vegetables and fruit, seems to be a pending task in adolescence, the results found for N-Owaist boys coincide with similar studies where children and adolescents had a regular consumption of fish [35,38]. On the other hand, although more research is needed to examine the types of dairy products in relation to the risk of childhood and adolescent overweight, the accumulated evidence from studies suggests that dairy consumption is associated inversely and longitudinally with the risk of overweight and obesity in these ages [53,54]. In addition, having them for breakfast reduces the chances of choosing less healthy products [55,56].  In the case of the N-Oweight participants, a regular consumption of nuts (≥2–3/week) is observed in boys.",863b83b5-65f3-435c-8ece-35ea759610b8
17,methods19," The impact of a regular consumption of nuts on health is more than proven [57]. In addition, its consumption is inversely related to the risk of overweight and obesity [58], data that support the results obtained in this group. As in the N-Owaist girls, the N-Oweight girls had a higher consumption of dairy products and cereal or grain products for breakfast. Both aspects support a better choice of food for breakfast by these two groups of girls, being therefore able to condition a better body composition, since not having these habits in the case of Owaist and Oweight in the present sample turned out to be a risk factor.  Having a second serving of fruit daily is controversial between boys and girls, since a greater consumption in N-Owaist boys could increase the relative risk of Owaist, but there is a greater consumption in Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight girls, in whom, however, not consuming it prevents the development of Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight in them.",f5965967-1cba-4b88-a981-86ff8b76c960
18,methods20," Although non-self-reported studies are necessary to be more conclusive in this regard, a possible explanation could be the lack of concretion of Q1 and Q2, in which fruit and fruit juice are matched. This could, in the worst case, be from industrial production. This aspect is fundamental, since the degree of food processing influences the health effects of fruit-based products [59,60]. Thus, whole fresh fruit does not contribute to obesity and may have a place in the prevention and management of excess adiposity [59,61,62], 100% fruit juices can have intermediate effects [63], and canned fruit and sweetened fruit juice are positively associated with the risk of all-cause mortality and type 2 diabetes, as well as obesity [59,60,61]. This aspect is important in order to adjust the official recommendations for fruit consumption.",35f74c5a-069b-4804-85ad-2067189ecd00
19,methods21,"  The answers to the negative (−) questions of the KIDMED questionnaire and their relation to the parameters of body composition analyzed according to sex also offered disparities. Ultra-processed, hypercaloric and high-fat food products, sugar, and added salt are one of the main factors that cause obesity in these ages [64,65,66,67]. This is related to some of the results obtained in boys, where there is a higher consumption of sweets and candy several times every day in Ofat or more visits to fast-food restaurants (>1/week) in Oweight participants. These results coincide with similar studies in adolescents, where daily intake of sweets or going to fast-food restaurants more than once was common [38,39,68].  On the contrary, other results diverge with a lower consumption of pastries and commercially baked goods for breakfast in Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight boys, or a lower level of intake of sweets and candy several times every day in Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight girls.",d4d4f122-9b6f-49fd-9072-3f70048bcff4
20,methods22," In addition, these contradictory data are reinforced by verifying that the Owaist and Ofat girls go less frequently to fast-food restaurants. Although the choice of healthy foods is crucial at these ages, impacting on their current and future health [69], more thorough studies that relate this aspect to body composition beyond the body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI) are required in adolescents.  Breakfast has been associated with a lower risk of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents [70,71]. Moreover, skipping breakfast correlates with a worse body composition in both [37,68]. The results obtained in the present study are in line with both aspects, since skipping breakfast was more common in Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight boys, and could be also considered as a risk factor in this sample.",2969aebc-4973-4622-bb71-9a1e3ac5d273
21,methods23," This is currently still a controversial topic, since despite the number of studies and reviews that support it, the evidence reviewed does not confirm a causal relationship, due to the quality, the poor design of some studies, or the possible influence of confounding variables [72,73]. We need to keep in mind that much of the food that teenagers usually eat for breakfast is quite unhealthy [68] and that, therefore, it is more important to focus the debate on the quality of breakfast food, rather than on the dichotomy: having breakfast or not.  The lack of information about solid approaches to nutrition, the intensive promotion of ultra-processed food and beverages at these ages, as well as the limited availability of adequate nutritional education contribute to aggravating the problem of food at this age stage [74].  4.3.",797658b1-0a11-46c6-8fb9-4aebe9ad8591
22,methods24," Fitness Performance in Boys and Girls with and without Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight A high level of fitness from childhood to adulthood is positively related to health and a key factor in maintaining the current and future health status [75,76]. Moreover, abdominal adiposity in combination with a poor PF are directly associated with serious diseases [77,78]. The association between body composition parameters (waist circumference, percentage of body fat, and body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI)) and performance in numerous fitness tests has been extensively studied in Europe [79] and non-European countries [80,81], thus determining the need for preventive work and the monitoring of the health status of adolescents. If we examine the results of the tests of the Alpha Fitness Battery Test (AFB), a better performance can be observed among those participants with N-Owaist, N-Ofat, and N-Oweight in the long jump, speed/agility, and cardiorespiratory resistance tests.",05360273-0410-4a1a-a5a7-0f7c8a620ba8
23,methods25," These data are supported by various research studies that related elements of body composition and performance in various fitness tests [82,83,84]. The lower performance of Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight subjects could be due to their excess of weight since these tests involve propulsion or lifting of their own body mass [23,29]. Anyway, the low PF of the Owaist, Ofat and Oweight adolescents could condition an early onset of diseases that in turn would be aggravated by their early overweight.  On the other hand, manual dynamometry is the only test in which the Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight subjects of both sexes have higher results, except for Ofat boys. Similar data have been found by Gulias-Gonzalez et al. (2014) [85] and Garcia-Pastor et al. (2016) [83]. Both studies showed that overweight participants had better results in the hand grip test.",3d5e7cf7-5ec5-46b1-8c85-d900e95281a7
24,methods26," Taking into account our measurements of waist circumference, the body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI) and percentage of body fat, the highest values in the manual dynamometry test could be justified by the different rates of growth, bone and muscle development found in overweight and obese adolescents [86].  In addition, it should be borne in mind that overweight and obese adolescents have lower levels of participation in sports activities, with a tendency to be less active than those adolescents with a normal body composition [87]. This predisposes them to increase their obesity levels and reduce PF levels [88].  This study’s cross-sectional design has limitations, as the contributions must not be attributed to plausible causes. These could be used as indications for forthcoming research works. In addition, the data collection using the KIDMED questionnaire was self-reported, which could lead to an error in the reports and to memory bias due to the nature of the study.",c1849afc-71b0-46ea-9967-246e3dd6768a
25,methods27,"  5. Conclusions The values of Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight ranged from 21.4% (Owaist) to 27.1% (Oweight) with gender differences only in Ofat, in which the prevalence is higher in girls than boys. The Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight participants of both sexes presented higher levels of body mass, waist circumference, body fat percentage and body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI). No significant differences were found in the KIDMED Index for the N-Owaist, N-Ofat, and N-Oweight groups, although differences have been observed in some responses to KIDMED (i.e., consumes rice or pasta almost daily, skips breakfast, has pastries or commercially baked goods for breakfast in boys, has a second serving of fruit daily, eats sweets and candy several times every day, goes more than once per week to a fast-food restaurant, and eats dairy products for breakfast). Some of these differences could represent a risk factor for the condition of Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight in the present sample.",02877df3-d4e1-4fb6-a780-da0a349c84dd
26,methods28,"  Although it seems that the adherence to the MD measured with KIDMED does not have a great influence on the condition of Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight, it has been proven that there is a direct relationship between PF and Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight as boys and girls showed significantly lower results in all the Alpha Fitness Battery Test (AFB) tests, except for the handgrip test.  The differences between the N-Owaist, N-Ofat, and N-Oweight vs. Owaist, Ofat, and Oweight groups in relation to the variables analyzed highlight the need to make institutional and educational efforts aimed at promoting healthy eating habits and effective programs for physical exercise.
