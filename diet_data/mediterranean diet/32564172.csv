0,background0," Hypertension, as a worldwide health problem, is a main contributing factor to cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) and premature death, affecting about 1 billion adults globally [1, 2]. In contradiction of trends reported in the USA and northern Europe [3], evidence indicates that cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is elevating in Iran; hypertension is prevalent in 24% of women and 22% of men in this population [4]. It is anticipated that the burden of hypertension on communities rises continuously along with population ageing. Evidence has demonstrated that age, genetics, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status are risk factors for hypertension [5]; nevertheless, this disease is modifiable [6, 7] and well-controlled blood pressure (BP) can enhance quality of life, improve prognosis, and prevent its clinical complications [8, 9].",2167b951-860b-4dff-85c7-79f1ace9e2d2
1,background1,"  The changes in lifestyle, such as physical activity, weight reduction and dietary modifications are the main approaches for the prevention and management of hypertension [10]. Excessive consumption of dietary sodium, saturated fatty acids, cholesterol, and alcohol are shown to be linked to an elevated risk of hypertension, while intake of vegetables/fruits and foods rich in magnesium, calcium, potassium, and unsaturated fatty acids is reported to reduce blood pressure [5, 11]. Whereas previous dietary recommendations for the prevention of hypertension focused mainly on single micronutrients or food items, a more effective approach for this purpose is recommendations that cover the entire quality of diet using dietary pattern, considering potential interactions of food items/nutrients [12–16].",653d01d5-199a-4759-86e0-be659b47347a
2,background2," The overall quality of diet could be assessed using the a posteriori and the a priori methods, in which the a posteriori approaches derive dietary patterns exploratory according the intake of foods reported by the studied population, but, the a priori approaches evaluate the adherence of participants to a predefined healthy dietary index [17]. Dietary approach to stop hypertension (Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)) dietary pattern, featured by low intake of salt, saturated fat, red meat, and high intake of low-fat dairy products, fish, nuts, fruits, whole grains, vegetables, magnesium, potassium, calcium, and fiber, is the most effective dietary pattern to reduce BP [18].",1724daee-aa3c-429d-9143-69577b3c0c70
3,background3," Moreover, evidence shows that higher diet quality assessed by other a priori dietary indices, including the Mediterranean dietary score (Mediterranean dietary score (MDS)), diet quality index-international (DQI-I), healthy eating index-2015 (HEI-2015), and dietary diversity score (dietary diversity score (DDS)) are protective against the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [19–22]. Nevertheless, the relation of these indices to hypertension is not well-established.  The Fasa Cohort Study [23] provided this opportunity to evaluate diet–disease associations from an epidemiological standpoint. The present analysis was conducted to explore the relation of Mediterranean dietary score (MDS), HEI-2015, DQI-I, and dietary diversity score (DDS) to the risk of hypertension in an Iranian population.

Detailed protocol of the Fasa Cohort Study is reported previously [23]. It was performed during November 2014 and June 2019. In summary, among a total of 41,000 persons resident in rural regions of Sheshdeh, a district from Fasa County, 11,097 individuals aged 35 to 70 years were included. Subjects were included if they were not physically or mentally disabled, aged 35–70 years, and lived in Sheshdeh district ≥9 months each year. All subjects had a similar socioeconomic level.

Subjects were invited by healthcare experts working in the rural health system to obtain blood samples, BP, dietary intake and general information. All individuals participating in the study signed a written consent. The Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of medical sciences, Shiraz, Iran approved the protocol of the study (code: IR.FUMS.REC.1399.500).  Dietary intake assessment  A validated 125-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) [25] was applied to assess the usual dietary intake of subjects through a face to face interview by the same expert nutritionist.",a3a24ab0-78fd-425a-8e29-e274a11a1eb7
6,methods2," The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) used in our study was modified in accordance with the Iranian food culture, in which participants were asked to report the frequency and amount of each food item on daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly bases through the past year. All of the portion sizes or household measures for each food were converted to grams/day of consumption. Then, energy and nutrient contents of foods were calculated using the Nutritionist IV software (version 7.0).  Healthy eating index-2015 (HEI-2015)  HEI-2015 was calculated using the technique described by Krebs-Smith et al.

7,methods3," Consumption of the first six components was scored between 0 and 5, while other components received a score from 0 to 10 in proportion to the intake of related foods. For the first 9 components, subjects with the highest intake were given the highest score and those consuming lowest intake received the lowest score, while for sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, as well as refined grains, the participants who consumed the highest amount of the related item were given the lowest score proportionally. The score of all components was added together to calculate the total score of the HEI-2015, ranging between 0 and 100.  Mediterranean dietary score (Mediterranean dietary score (MDS))  The Mediterranean dietary score (MDS) was calculated based on the method of Trichopoulou (2003) et al.

In this study, due to the low reporting of alcohol intake in Iranians as well as the absence of alcohol in the Iranian Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), the modified model of the Mediterranean dietary score (MDS) was applied, in which alcohol consumption was not included in the calculations. According to the median intake of the mentioned components, a score of 0 or 1 was given to each factor as follows: for vegetables, fish, cereals, legumes, a high ratio of MUFA/SFA, and fruits and nuts, those with consumption equal to or lower than the median received score of 0, and 1 otherwise.

Diet diversity score (dietary diversity score (DDS))  dietary diversity score (DDS) was calculated using the protocol of Kant et al. [28] based on the intake of five food groups including bread-grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and meats. These groups were divided into 23 subgroups in order to represent the dietary diversity across the groups of the Food Guide Pyramid.",d21d74e8-fa6c-4e0e-993d-e66dae851fba

Participants were considered as consumer of one food group if they consumed at least one-half serving daily as described by the Food Pyramid quantity criteria. The maximum score of 2 was assigned to each group and the total dietary diversity score (DDS) ranged between of 0 and 10.

Participant were diagnosed as hypertension if they had a diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) ≥90 mmHg, systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) ≥140 mmHg,, or used antihypertensive drugs. Physical activity was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) and reported as metabolic equivalent hour per day (MET. h/day). Weight and height were evaluated with the use of a digital scale and body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was computed by dividing the weight (kg) by height squared (m2).",90e81658-7902-4886-9708-b4882896b6f0

24,discussion1,"  In the studied population of the present study, which included middle-aged/elderly people in Iran (aged from 35 to 70), hypertension was more prevalent among females than men. In line with our study, in a study in India, hypertension was more prevalent among Elderly females than men [30]. It is worth noting that the mean body mass index (BMI) (26.84 ± 4.86 vs. 24.19 ± 4.42) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) (94.88 ± 6.19 vs. 91.54 ± 6.33) were significantly higher in women compared with men in our study. Higher body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) have been strongly related to increased BP [31]; this might, in part, justify higher prevalence of hypertension observed in females in this study.  It has been proposed that high-quality diets, such as the Mediterranean dietary score (MDS) and HEI, may prevent development of hypertension in healthy people and could further reduces blood pressure in hypertensive people who use antihypertensive drugs [9, 32].",e947eb37-d178-4373-8858-1ae234004104
25,discussion2," A recent meta-analysis found that intervention with the Mediterranean diet for 1 year decreased both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [33]. Supporting our results, the study by Shim et al. [9] reported that a high adherence to the Korean version of HEI is favorably related to BP control in men with physician-diagnosed hypertension. Moreover, the cross sectional study of Saraf-Bank et al. [34] revealed that a greater adherence to HEI-2010 is negatively liked to high BP among Iranian adult women. Nevertheless, the study by Daneshzad et al. [35] found no association between HEI and mean systolic and diastolic BP. Both Mediterranean dietary score (MDS) and HEI-2015 have many similarities and emphasize on high intake of fish, fruits, vegetables, monounsaturated fat, legumes, whole grains, and low consumption of saturated fatty acids.",876d3595-2f8c-4097-978f-7619137c69b8
26,discussion3," They also differ in some components such that the Mediterranean dietary score (MDS) scores dairies negatively but HEI-2015 scored diaries positively [26, 27]. Furthermore, HEI-2015 recommends lowers intakes for added sugars, refined grains, and sodium [26], which its association with hypertension is established [36]. These diet are rich in fiber and have a low energy density and low glycemic load, all of which are p[protective against hypertension [37]. The favorable impacts of vegetables/fruits on hypertension has been also demonstrated [38]. This relationship could also be attributed to potential healthy constituents such as phytochemicals, fibers, vitamins, magnesium, and potassium and antioxidants in vegetables and fruits [39], which have been independently related to a reduction in BP [40–42]. The study by Shah et al.",7975a1f7-b7a4-4ede-8dc7-b58bcefdbbed
27,discussion4," [43] proposed lower inflammation, lower endothelial oxidative stress, and greater endothelial functioning as potential novel underlying mechanisms through which components of Mediterranean dietary score (MDS) might affects vascular changes related to improved cardiovascular risk.  There are very limited evidence regarding the relation of dietary diversity score (DDS) and DQI-I to BP. Some previous studies reported lower systolic or diastolic BP in higher categorizes of dietary diversity score (DDS) and DQI-I [21, 44]. A cross-sectional study of 82 adults living in Saba Island in the eastern Caribbean Basin identified a significant link between a diet with poor diversity and the increased risk of hypertension [44]. In contrast, a cross-sectional study on 230 Iranian women with type 2 diabetes identified no significant difference in SBD and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) across categorizes of DQI-I [35].",1ed0e3cf-aa84-4e0a-b069-a31a62896e6e

It should be considered that the results of logistic regression analysis is a more reliable as large sample size of the study makes small differences in means as significant; hence this study concluded a null association between dietary diversity score (DDS), DQI-I and risk of hypertension.",0ee32304-3c35-4f17-b290-95629653e2b1
29,discussion6," The heterogeneity in the results of this study campared with the previous studies might be due to differences in sample size, method used to assess dietary intake, study design, health status of participants, different level of adjustment for confounders, and method of data analysis.  In line with our study, some studies [4, 21], but not all [45], reported that higher dietary diversity score (DDS) is related to higher prevalence of obesity. This association is expectable as consumption of a more varied diet is linked to higher nutritional adequacy, greater intake of macronutrients and also energy [46], proposing that intake of a large number of foods may result in a higher calorie intake, and thus, obesity [21]. It is notable that the Mediterranean dietary score (MDS), DQI-I, and HEI-2015 were related to a healthier profile for obesity measures, which has also been observed in some previous investigations [47–49].",3c723746-6b7d-4715-8122-59765e01384e
30,discussion7," These negative relationships with obesity parameters were expected, as these dietary patterns are rich in fiber and have low energy density and low glycemic load, all of which have a protective effect against obesity [50, 51]. However, the association of these dietary patterns on health outcomes is derived from the interaction of all components and could not be attributed to a single food item. The prospective study by Funtikova et al. [52] on 2181 participants revealed that, during a 10-year follow-up, a higher DQI score at baseline related to a decrease in WC. Another study on Chinese diabetic patients showed that the HEI, but not DQI-I, score had a negative relationship with obesity [53]. In a cross-sectional study recruiting 1062 Mexican women, with age between 35 to 69 years, MED was linked with lower WC whereas other a priori dietary patterns (DQI –I and HEI) were not predictors of anthropometric measures [54].",e692e29a-b172-42f4-90d9-91114553c65e
31,discussion8," Moreover, unlike our findings, adherence to HEI, Mediterranean dietary score (MDS), and DQI-I could not predict body mass index (BMI) and WC in Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study after 6.7 years of follow-up [55]. The capability of dietary indices to predict obesity measures relies on how well these indices correlate with dietary energy intake as the chief cause of obesity. However, these indices do not assign negative scores to excessive energy intakes; this limitation makes it difficult to reach a consistent conclusion across studies. The discrepancies regarding the relation of diet quality indices to obesity-related parameters may also be derived from differences in genetic background, interaction of gene-environmental factors, and difference in adjustment for potential confounders and disease pattern in various studies.",1902e54a-c2ed-44e4-bf1f-99afb7cbec5f
32,discussion9,"  The strengths of the present study are its large population representative sample derived from a recent nationwide study and consideration of the potential covariates in the analysis. Moreover, another positive point of this study is face to face interview for data collection of Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), which makes the data more reliable. Also, conducting the anthropometric measurements instead of self-reporting can be considered as a strength. However, there are several limitations in this study that should be considered when inferring the findings. First, since our study had a cross-sectional design, causal association could not be inferred; although, cross-sectional studies provide valuable data on diet–disease associations. Future longitudinal studies can provide stronger evidence in this regard.",74a3bf14-3514-4270-8cc6-c0dfc52c6a55
33,discussion10," Second, Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) is susceptible to recall bias, such that subjects might under- or overestimate their food intake resulting in misclassification of food intake. As a structured dietary assessment method, the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) is less precise than methods of daily intake such as 24-h recalls and food records. Although 24-h food recall is used mostly in calculating HEI-2015, there are several well-designed studies that have used Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) for calculating HEI-2015 [56]. Because of severe attenuation, both Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and multiple 24-h recalls cannot be recommended as an instrument for evaluating relations between absolute intake of diet and disease. These instruments could be used for detecting diet-disease association when considering the relative dietary intake of participants.",c9d5f55f-d862-4c07-94d4-c1553831e4c2
34,discussion11," Finally, however it was attempted to control for known covariates, the probability of residual confounding could not be omitted in our results.  Conclusions  In conclusion, this study proposes that greater adherence to Mediterranean dietary score (MDS) and HEI-2015 diets, but not DQI-I and dietary diversity score (DDS), reduces the risk of hypertension. In addition, higher adherence to Mediterranean dietary score (MDS), DQI-I, and HEI-2015 as well as lower score for dietary diversity score (DDS) was related to a healthier profile for obesity measures. Further investigations, in particular prospective cohort studies, are required to confirm these conclusions.  Supplementary Information  Additional file 1: Supplemental Table 1.
