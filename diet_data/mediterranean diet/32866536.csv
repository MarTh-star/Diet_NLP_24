Rs9939609 in Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO), rs17782313 near MC4R, rs326 in LPL, rs16147 in NPY, rs2943641 near IRS-1 were genotyped.   Study design and participants  18 overweight or obese individuals, affected by T2D or impaired glucose regulation (IGR), attended by the Diabetes, Nutrition, and Metabolism Unit at “Gabriele d’Annunzio” University Hospital in Chieti, Italy, were recruited. Study protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Province di Chieti and Pescara. In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, all participants gave their written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.",6fa7cb86-93ed-4656-8797-b9332b2154fd
1,methods1," The inclusion criteria were overweight or obese (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 25 and ≥ 30 kg/m2, respectively) subjects (male or female), ≥ 18 years of age, affected by T2D or Impaired Glucose Regulation (impaired glucose regulation (IGR)) (Impaired Fasting Glucose or Impaired Glucose Tolerance). The exclusion criteria were the presence of Type 1 Diabetes, Eating Behavior Disorders, or other conditions that might have interfered with the development and completion of the project or cause failure to adherence to the protocol.  Interventions and outcome assessment  All participants were included in an educational and nutritional program as described below. At baseline, each subject underwent an individual interview focusing on Medical Nutrition Therapy (Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT)) and healthy lifestyle with a physician and a dietitian from the team. Demographic characteristics as well as clinical and anthropometric parameters were collected.",c7c27052-6cec-4d20-982a-334b59501168
2,methods2," In detail, body weight and height, Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)), waist and hip circumferences (WC and HC, respectively), HbA1c, and blood pressure were included. Moreover, adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) was assessed using a validated 14-item questionnaire (PREDIMED) which generates a range of possible scores: no adherence (score ≤ 5), medium adherence (6 ≤ score ≤ 9), and maximum adherence (score ≥ 10) [18]. In addition, we evaluated the physical activity level using a short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) [19].  Participants were actively involved in face-to-face individual and group-based intervention through a theoretical and practical course which included content on healthy nutrition and lifestyle.",dca8d010-fa6c-4c47-a387-123f451561f9
3,methods3,"  The objectives to be achieved were, according to the MedDiet: (i) an improvement in the composition of the meals, in particular emphasizing non-starchy vegetable, whole foods over highly processed foods to the extent possible, minimizing added sugars and refined grain; (ii) a 7–10% weight decrease compared to the initial body weight achieved through an individualized eating plan; (iii) increasing moderate-intensity physical activity to at least 150 min per week [24]. The program was conducted using a nutritional and educational approach in accordance with the current literature [20–23]. The first face-to-face individual intervention was a clinical check-up and the recording of the individual’s clinical history. Also, during this first encounter, participants were instructed on how to keep a journal on dietary self-monitoring, based on the scientific literature [20–23]. The journal entries were discussed by the participant and the physician at the next meeting.",2adc94af-b3f3-436a-806e-36eacff1f168
4,methods4," To ensure the active involvement of patients in the change process, educational group sessions intervention was considered essential to improve the lifestyle of these obese and/or T2D subjects. Group-based intervention was organized in sessions performed with small groups of up to 10 people in the presence of a trained facilitator. Therefore, the endpoint of this study became the comparison between the subjects’ anthropometric and clinical parameters as well as PREDIMED and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scores at baseline, with those at 6 months (T6) and 12 months (T12) and its relationship with genetic variants.  Gene and SNP selection  Nutrigenetic variants from five genetic loci, identified by previous Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) or replication studies as associated with T2DM, obesity, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism and dietary intake were selected for this study.",6f8dbdf3-7db4-47c0-bde3-d5b993ee30d8
5,methods5," In details, two of these variants, namely rs9939609 (T > A) in Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) and rs17782313 (T > C) near MC4R, were associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) and hunger control [25–28]; rs326 (A > G) in LPL was involved in lipid metabolism [29–31]; rs16147 (T > C) in NPY was involved in adiposity and obesity [32–34]; rs2943641 (C > T) near IRS-1 was involved in obesity, insulin resistance, T2DM risk [35].  Genetic analysis  A blood sample from each patient was collected in a sterile tube containing EDTA and stored at + 4 °C before analysis. The genetic analysis was conducted at the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, ‘‘G. d’Annunzio” University of Chieti-Pescara.

7,analysis0," Descriptive statistics relied, after Shapiro–Wilk’s test to evaluate the departures from normality distribution for each variable, on median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)) for continuous variables and on absolute and relative frequencies (%) for qualitative variables.  Friedman test or chi-square was applied to evaluate a statistically significant variation over time for quantitative and qualitative variables, respectively.  Several linear mixed models tested the effect of different genotypes and time on features of interest; namely weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, total cholesterol, LDH, HDL and triglyceride levels. Moreover, within linear mixed models, the interaction between genotype and time was also considered. In order to test differences in PREDIMED and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the Friedman test was used. Three models of inheritance (i.e., dominant, recessive, and additive) were tested.",3e039e9c-1d9c-4fb5-b22c-6082d14ea107
8,analysis1," If the alleles of the gene of interest are A and B in haploid, and B is the ‘risk’ allele, the dominant genetic model assumes that the risk is the same for heterozygotes, carrying 1 copy of the high-risk allele B, as for homozygotes, and the data are dichotomized into “carriers” versus “non-carriers” (i.e., ‘BB + AB’ versus ‘AA’). The recessive genetic model assumes 2 copies of B are required for the risk to be different from the baseline risk (i.e., ‘BB’ versus ‘AB + AA’); the additive model hypothesizes that AA, AB, and BB are associated with the lowest, the intermediate, and the highest risk, respectively (‘AA’ versus ‘AB’ versus ‘BB’) [36–38]. All tests were two-sided and a level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

15,discussion1," The dominant model showed that subjects carrying the A risk allele in Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) lost less weight and had a lower Body Mass Index (BMI) decrease from baseline to T12 than TT carriers, in spite of the same nutritional intervention. In addition, we observed a significant change in the PREDIMED score over time according to genotypes for Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609. To date, the exact function of Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) remains undefined, but it should be noted that polymorphisms located in the Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) gene not only represent genetic risk factors for obesity, but have been linked with Body Mass Index (BMI), gestational diabetes mellitus (gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)), T2D, and eating behavior [39–41].",7ae0c1d7-47d8-426c-879c-137e66e90b0b
16,discussion2," In addition, it has been suggested that the Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) variants may influence the expression of other genes such as the homeobox gene Iroquois-class homeobox protein 2 (IRX3) rather than the Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) itself [42]. Some studies showed that the Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 is associated with energy homeostasis and body composition, increasing food intake as well as appetitive behaviors reducing response in hunger and satiety after a meal [43–48]. It has also been reported that diet/lifestyle induced weight loss differs among Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) genotypes, although results are contradictory [49–56]. On the other hand, a systematic review and meta-analysis reported significant differences in weight loss between the AA and TT genotypes after dietary intervention [57].

17,discussion3," [58] demonstrated that a higher adherence to the MedDiet was associated with lower obesity risk in subjects with more genetic predisposition to obesity, compared to those with lower MedDiet adherence and lower genetic risk score. Our results agree with more recent studies, suggesting, even in a non-significant manner, that homozygous carriers of Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) obesity-predisposing allele lose less weight after having followed a 4 week dietary intervention based on the Mediterranean model than non-carriers [59]. To the best of our knowledge, few and contradictory studies have assessed the effects of LPL rs326, NPY rs16147 and near IRS-1 rs2943641 on metabolic response and weight change after a dietary intervention, thus evidence is scarce and limited.",051d34ad-19cb-4004-992c-5fd217ab6e1f
18,discussion4," In the present study, no difference among basal and post-treatment values of anthropometric variables (Body Mass Index (BMI), weight, waist circumference, and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scores) based on genotype in LPL, NPY and IRS-1 was found. Nevertheless, subjects with the risk-conferring CC genotype in IRS-1 gene had greater decreases in Total Cholesterol than those without this genotype across one-year intervention, although not statistically significant. Our finding is in line with a previous study [60], which showed that HDL cholesterol decreased, and serum triglycerides increased for each copy of the rs2943641 risk allele among T2D subjects.",2472cea3-ee2b-4a84-8cae-2501f18520ed
19,discussion5," The insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is considered a major mediator between the insulin receptor and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in the insulin signaling pathway and it has been reported that rs2943641, located in inter-genic region 500 kb upstream from the IRS1 may have an effect on IRS1 expression associated PI3K activity [61, 62]. Subjects with CC genotype of the rs2943641 showed a higher improvement in insulin resistance than T allele carriers when adhering to a high-carbohydrate and low-fat diet in a 2 year randomized trial [63]. Thus, although the mechanisms underlying the interaction between the IRS1 gene variant and diet on insulin action remain to be elucidated, the activation of IRS1 associated PI3K activity may be enhanced in rs2943641 CC subjects in response to a low-fat and high-carbohydrate diet. In our study, we showed a significant change of the PREDIMED score from baseline to month 12 according to genotypes for NPY rs16147.",2595077b-8431-4af1-a085-a7db0ffee59d
20,discussion6," NPY is an orexigenic neuropeptide that regulates the hypothalamic control of energy, immune function, and cardiovascular function [64–66]. Variants in the NPY gene have been associated with several human diseases stimulating food intake, decreasing energy expenditure, and increasing energy stored [67]. In this view, lymphoblastoid cell lines showed higher NPY expression in risk allele carriers of rs16147, demonstrating allele-specific effects on NPY gene expression and NPY peptide concentrations [68, 69]. Regarding body weight regulation, it has been showed that the rs16147 variant affected anthropometric, biochemical and inflammatory parameters in response to dietary interventions in overweight or obese subjects [70, 71], and its effect on central obesity and abdominal fat distribution were modified by dietary fat, suggesting that individuals carrying the C allele of the NPY rs16147 SNP might benefit more by taking a high-fat weight loss diet [72]. Recently, Martin et al.",231917c0-69c9-498f-a25c-97faeb5bfdda
21,discussion7," [73] demonstrated that the A allele of this NPY variant produces a better metabolic response in terms of insulin resistance and basal insulin secondary to weight loss with two different hypocaloric diets in obese subjects, with improvement being higher with the Mediterranean diet. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether genetic variants may influence the outcomes of the nutritional intervention. To date, it should be emphasized that there are discrepancies in previous weight loss clinical studies due to: (i) the types of interventions, including energy-restricted diets, duration of the intervention, and physical activity interventions; (ii) the participants’ heterogeneity in what concerns age (adults, older adults), ancestry, nutritional status (overweight, obese, severely obese), pathologic situation/status (prediabetic, diabetic); (iii) the dietary assessment method that can produce inaccurate dietary data collection [74].",8f6f058f-022e-4ebc-b35e-fae3572f1b29
22,discussion8," Therefore, with regard to the analysis of gene–diet interactions, all the aspects mentioned above make comparisons between findings difficult and should be considered in order to achieve comparability across different studies. The strength of our study is that it is based on intensive nutritional intervention. However, several limitations of this pilot study warrant consideration. One limitation is that the sample size of the current study is small for a genetic association study. In addition, although personalized nutrition refers mainly to a person’s genetic background, the composition of gut microbiota and epigenetic markers may modify gene expression and could be involved in the outcome of weight loss interventions.",1b0549a3-2683-4cea-a8bb-44f866a5a524
23,discussion9," In the era of precision medicine, the integration of nutrigenetic, epigenetic, as well as metagenomic data may offer meaningful opportunities for the design of more personalized dietary treatments to optimize an individual’s response to dietary interventions, as well as to improve the prevention and treatment of metabolic disturbances, such as T2M, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases [13, 15]. In summary, our study showed an interaction between the modification of the PREDIMED score over time and Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) as well as NPY. Although it remains unknown whether genetic risk for obesity is associated with timing of food choices [75], genetic variants with central nervous system functions could affect the control of food intake and food-choice behavior. Future clinical intervention studies should explore whether food choices may influence the causal pathway between genetic risk and weight gain.",380f86f6-8dd1-4eb4-89e8-5d4d300ec5b3
24,discussion10," In addition, our preliminary findings support the impact of the interaction between Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) gene and diet/lifestyle intervention in the regulation of body weight. Even though the suboptimal statistical power resulting from the small sample size prevents us from clearly demonstrating the effect of the genetic variants on nutritional intervention, we believe that further studies on the role of Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO), a key gene in food intake and appetite, are highly needed with regard to lifestyle intervention. Therefore, an extension of our preliminary findings in larger, multicenter cohorts is warranted.",9c124887-d169-4a1e-972e-a5c4bb12b4fc
25,discussion11,"  If Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 is confirmed to influence the decreasing of Body Mass Index (BMI) and body composition during nutritional treatments, this notion can encourage a shift toward both the development of personalized nutritional advice and monitoring based on joint associations of dietary pattern and genotypes. It should be noted that favorable lifestyle should be universally recommended in obesity prevention, regardless of genetic make-up, thus supporting current public health guidelines.  Conclusions  In summary, our pilot study showed an interaction between the modification of the PREDIMED score over time and Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) as well as NPY. In addition, our findings support the interaction between Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) gene and diet/lifestyle intervention in the regulation of body weight.",bfa10981-cbbc-4ed9-a6e5-e17ead866c38
26,discussion12," So, we can say that if Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 is confirmed to influence the decreasing of Body Mass Index (BMI) and body composition during nutritional treatments, this can encourage a shift toward both the development of personalized nutritional advice and monitoring based on joint associations of dietary pattern and genotypes.
