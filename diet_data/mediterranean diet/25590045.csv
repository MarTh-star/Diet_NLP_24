0,background0,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) and its progressive form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)) are among the most prevalent of liver diseases worldwide. Approximately 20 to 30 % of the adult population has Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), making it the most common liver disease in developed countries [1–3]. The incidence is as high as 50–85 % in people with pre-diabetes and diabetes [4, 5], with diabetic patients having a two to threefold higher risk of dying of chronic liver disease, primarily attributable to Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [6]. In addition, Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), independent of the classical risk factors [7]. cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Australia and globally [8].",d208e535-7c8e-42be-a93a-7fc13469762a
1,background1," An estimated 30 % of patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which leads to cirrhosis and its complications including, portal hypertensive bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic decompensation [9]. Insulin resistance is strongly implicated in the development of steatosis (fatty liver) and its progression to non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The clinically relevant lesion progresses to cirrhosis in 20–30 % of cases and leads to liver cancer in 2–5 % of cases [10]. Currently no proven, safe, effective therapy exists for Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [11]. Given the increasing prevalence of these conditions and high incidence of associated metabolic comorbidities, the global burden is expected to steadily increase.  Diet is a modifiable risk factor that can potentially be targeted in both the prevention and treatment of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",69b9b2d9-c5a7-4981-9d4d-d49b8cd0322d
2,background2," Currently no firm dietary recommendations can be formulated in the management of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) because of the paucity of high quality evidence-based data associated with metabolic outcomes. However current data suggests that patients should aim to achieve a 5–10 % weight reduction, reduce saturated and trans fat, limit fructose, limit intake of simple carbohydrates and substitute with complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, fibre and fruits [12–14]. However, weight loss is neither easy to achieve or maintain and weight loss achieved in research trials is not easily replicated in the clinic or real world settings. As such, there is an urgent need for therapies independent of weight loss.  The health benefits of the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) have gained popularity in the scientific literature and lay world with respect to being one of the healthiest diets in the world.",5a1cb845-30c0-445e-840f-147cf33a700d
3,background3," Its effects are well researched in high quality studies such as PREDIMED and benefits are attributed to a lower incidence of chronic disease including cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, dementia, some cancers, and overall mortality demonstrating its safety, palatability and sustainability [15].  Pilot data to support the shift from current dietary therapy to a novel MedDiet intervention of patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been published by Ryan et al. in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients [16]. This study demonstrated a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis with the MedDiet compared to no change in the low fat diet group.",1c4c3e2e-890d-4188-97a1-219d81f273b6
4,background4,"  This study, MEDINA (Mediterranean Dietary Intervention study in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) aims to replicate the findings of Ryan et al’s pilot study ina larger cohort of participants with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a more translatable environment and with assessment of sustainability. The study aims to investigate the effects of adhering to the MedDiet as compared to a low fat diet. We hypothesise that the MedDiet will demonstrate a potential to reverse insulin resistance and reduce fatty liver and that the benefits will be sustained 12 months post study initiation date with maintenance of the diet. We also aim to explore molecular mechanisms at play in the disease process and the interplay with diet. ",dd0aa61f-bddb-4f87-8371-38421c9ca892

23,discussion0,"Currently, there are no safe or effective proven therapies for the treatment of patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [25]. While diet and lifestyle changes focussing on achieving weight loss are the accepted recommendations for this patient group, weight loss is both difficult to achieve and maintain [26–28]. Despite this there have been a limited number of randomised controlled trials in this patient group and no specific diet has been identified as superior to another [29, 30]. In a cross-over study [16] which forms the pilot data for this trial, patients in the MedDiet arm had significant improvements in insulin sensitivity as determined by a 3-hour hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp and a significant reduction (39 %) in hepatic steatosis. In contrast there was no significant improvement in insulin sensitivity and only a 7 % reduction of hepatic steatosis with the low fat, high carbohydrate diet.",a916be42-087c-459c-98cc-e9a39302f805
24,discussion1," The changes observed in the intervention group were without a significant reduction in weight [16]. The MedDiet has positive effects on insulin sensitivity, which has been attributed to the high content of bio-active phytochemicals with a range of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity [31]. The MedDiet is characterised by a specific fatty acid profile: low in saturated fat (7–8 % of total energy) and high in monounsaturated fat (20 % of total energy). A Spanish study showed that treatment with a balanced diet rich in olive oil contributes to the recovery of the liver from hepatic steatosis [32]. This was achieved by decreasing activation of hepatic stellate cell (decrease hepatic collagen) by monounsaturated fatty acids, which is less susceptible to lipid peroxidation as compared to polyunsaturated fatty acids.",73d96c0c-ceda-4189-b052-325c4d56840c
25,discussion2,"  This study aims to assess the MedDiet in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients to determine whether this dietary pattern is superior compared to the current recommendations for patients, thus developing a more evidence based therapy that can be translated into the clinical setting. In addition by addressing diet and lifestyle factors there is likely to be secondary prevention of associated chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) which are shown to share some pathophysiological similarities with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  This study is also one of the first randomised controlled trials assessing the MedDiet in a non-Mediterranean country. Thus, will provide insight into implementation of the dietary principals across various cultures and the feasibility and sustainability of these changes in specific ethnic groups.",f5e80470-3761-4bff-821d-b49cbb6d58ef
26,discussion3, The novel markers of compliance including food diaries and food frequency questionnaires will also be supported by robust markers such as plasma fatty acids and urinary metabolites. Other lifestyle changes including physical activity will be measured using the Active Australia Questionnaire and will be considered in the assessment of final results.  Although environmental influences such as diet have a well-established association with disease it is important to acknowledge that the interplay of genetics and environment are a widely accepted influence in disease outcomes. The relationship between the genome and nutrition (nutrigenomics) is a growing area of research. Studying nutrition alongside genetics is vital as it is now well established that even small differences in gene sequences can alter the metabolic pathways which make individuals more or less responsive to certain diets [33].,8b4c330b-bb41-4f7e-8da2-3328940fa29e
27,discussion4," Investigating the genotype in terms of response and non-response to the MedDiet in an exploratory manner enhances the understanding at the genomic and molecular level. By examining the associated phenotype with anthropometric and biochemical indices in a Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) population and correlating these to inflammation and markers of insulin resistance may help to identify individuals at greater cardio metabolic risk.  This intervention study has the capacity to provide a cost effective and sustainable therapy for large and increasing patient group which we feel would be highly acceptable and widely applicable at a community level, with the potential to reduce cost burden on society and improve health outcomes for individuals.",854acda8-ac1a-4d4b-a824-a0f513c2a1ec
