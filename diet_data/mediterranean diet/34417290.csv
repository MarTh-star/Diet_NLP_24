0,methods0," Study design and sample collection  Detailed study design and study procedures have been reported previously (22). In brief, four-week-old A/J, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, and non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were acclimated for two weeks and then randomized to one of five diets: traditional Mediterranean diet (MeD), Japanese diet (JD), typical American diet (mentioned as Western diet (WD) hereafter), ketogenic diet (KD), or control mouse chow with five mice per diet, sex, and strain (Supplementary Figure 1). Mice were housed five per cage and maintained at 22°C under a 12-h light cycle. The mice were maintained on the experimental human and mouse control diets from 6 to 30 weeks of age. Fecal samples were collected at 30 weeks of age and stored at −80°C until further processing. The final dataset had 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data from 149 mice (n = 27–34 per diet, 27–44 per strain, and 3–10 per diet-strain, Supplementary Table 1).",2ccb380b-4224-4b1b-b66f-296f65f701e1

2,methods2,"  Clinical phenotype assays  Blood samples were collected for clinical phenotyping following a 6h fasting. Insulin concentrations were quantified using a Mouse Serum Adipokine Immunoassay ELISA kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA). A glucose tolerance test (glucose tolerance test (GTT)) was carried out after 6h of fasting. Blood glucose levels were measured with a Bionome GM100 glucose monitor (Bionome USA). Detailed glucose tolerance test (GTT) methodology has been reported earlier (22).  Anthropometric phenotype assays  Body composition was measured by EchoMRI-130 Body Composition Analyzer, which has been detailed earlier (22).  Gut microbiota assay  Stool DNA was extracted by using Fast DNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A mixed template amplicon library of the hypervariable region V3-V4 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was prepared by using 341F and 805R primer set (46).",66bdda4d-ef58-4de4-ba09-5ccf7ed8b864

5,analysis0," Statistical analyses were performed using R version V4.0.3 for Windows (49). Metadata continuous variables were analyzed for Normality using the Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test and QQ-normal plot. Variables with the Shapiro-Wilk “W” value ≥ 0.95 were considered Normal. Non-Normally distributed metadata variables were transformed by natural log, square root, square, or Box-Cox power transformation. If no appropriate transformation was found, the variables were normalized rank transformed. The amplicon sequence variants (ASV) table was filtered by removing any amplicon sequence variants (ASV) present in fewer than 5 samples and with a relative abundance ≤ 0.005% across all samples to calculate the differential taxa abundance. We utilized ANCOM-2.1 (50) with adjusted for confounding factors (e.g., sex, mouse strains, and diet) to determine the differential amplicon sequence variants (ASV) and genera abundance as described in the results below.",3dbe7fb7-392b-4f9c-96df-fc72861192a2

We performed a single rarefaction at a sequence depth of 15,000 sequences per sample. α-diversity (Shannon diversity index, Faith's phylogenetic diversity, and observed amplicon sequence variants (ASV)) and β-diversity (unweighted UniFrac, weighted UniFrac, and Bray Curtis) were calculated from the unfiltered amplicon sequence variants (ASV) table. Differences in microbial community β-diversity were tested by ADONIS using 999 permutations in the R package Vegan (51) upon controlling for the confounding factors as described in the result below. Principal coordinate (PCoA) analysis was carried out by PhyloSeq (52). ANOVA analysis was performed to compare between groups adjusted for confounding factors.",654b8745-8fb4-4503-9bf1-60763287ff2d

8,results0," Diet dominates host genetics in shaping gut microbiota  This study aimed to determine how popular dietary patterns modulate gut microbial diversity and composition in genetically diverse mouse strains and how the gut microbiota interacts with diet and host genetics to alter metabolic health. We assayed gut microbiota following 24 weeks of diet treatment using the widely used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing method. As expected, gut microbial diversity and composition were significantly influenced by both diet and genetics (Figures 1A–D). In particular, the microbial α-diversity was significantly different among the diets (Supplementary Figures 2A–C) with a higher diversity observed in MeD and a lower diversity in KD compared to WD and mouse control chow. Here we report three different α-diversity measures; observed amplicon sequence variants (ASV), Shannon diversity index, and Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity (Faith's PD).",359cabfe-aa4a-4f83-a909-014fa5a88e2d
9,results1," The observed amplicon sequence variants (ASV) (commonly known as observed species) depends on the number of different amplicon sequence variants (ASV) present in a sample that represents the richness of the sample. Shannon diversity index represents the richness of the sample weighted by the abundance of each of the amplicon sequence variants (ASV), while Faith's PD is the phylogenetic richness of the sample, an important diversity measure that considers the similarity between bacteria based on shared evolution. In our study, we found that diet explains 47, 36, 37% variability of the Shannon diversity index, Faith's PD, and Observer amplicon sequence variants (ASV), respectively. In contrast, the genetic background of the mouse strain explains only 8, 8, and 5% variability of the Shannon diversity index, Faith's PD, and Observer amplicon sequence variants (ASV), respectively.

In addition to α-diversity measures, we presented three commonly used β-diversity (Bray-Curtis, unweighted UniFrac, and weighted UniFrac) measures.",be5df5d8-c8a1-48cd-bfec-7257f329db8c
11,results3," β-diversity is a measure of how similar or dissimilar two or more microbial communities are. Bray-Curtis is a quantitative, non-phylogenetic β-diversity metric that considers only the abundance of the features. Unweighted UniFrac is a qualitative, phylogenetic β-diversity metric that depends on only the presence or absence of features and the phylogenic distance of the features (54). Unweighted UniFrac is more sensitive to rare bacterial taxa. Weighted UniFrac is a qualitative, phylogenetic β-diversity metric that additionally adjusts the unweighted UniFrac measures with the abundance of the features (54). Both weighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis consider the relative abundance of the amplicon sequence variants (ASV) and are more sensitive to the most abundant taxa. However, Bray-Curtis considers all features are equally dissimilar, but weighted UniFrac accounts for similarity based on shared evolution.",cc4e29a0-5aee-4b7a-87cd-c138a5bf37f9
12,results4," All above mentioned β-diversity measures were significantly different among the diets and mouse strains (Figure 1C; Supplementary Figures 3B,C, 4). For β-diversity, diet explained 20% to 28% variability of the gut microbiota, whereas genetics explained only 6–8% variability in β-diversity. These data highlight the dramatic effects diet can have on the gut microbiota as compared to host genetics (mouse strain in this case).  Host genetics modulate the association between diet and gut microbiota  The diet-induced alteration of the gut microbiota was influenced by the genetics of the host. In particular, a significant diet * genetic interaction was observed for both α and β-diversity measures. For instance, the KD significantly decreased the α-diversity measures (specifically Shannon diversity index, observed amplicon sequence variants (ASV), and Faith's PD) in FVB/NJ mice compared to both WD and mouse chow (Figures 1A,B; Supplementary Figure 3A).",f546a32f-95b5-4412-934e-89ef81e8e20d
13,results5," However, the effects of the KD on α-diversity measures were muted (limited to Shannon diversity index) in A/J mice, and absent in non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ mice.  Consistent with α-diversity, significant diet * genetic interactions on all microbial β-diversity measures were also observed (Figure 1C; Supplementary Figures 3B,C). Therefore, we determined the diet effect on the gut microbiota for each individual mouse strain using ADONIS function in the R package vegan and found that depending on the genetic background, the diet altered β-diversity measures differently with a range of 34–59%, 33–48%, and 45–57%, respectively, for weighted UniFrac, unweighted UniFrac, and Bray-Curtis β-diversity measures (Supplementary Table 2). These results demonstrate that genetics influences diet-induced alteration of microbial composition.",05704168-d58c-4708-9197-e61ecb955699
14,results6," The community differences among diets and strains were also reflective of large alterations in the mean relative abundance of the specific bacterial genera (Figure 1D) and amplicon sequence variants (ASV)s (Supplementary Figure 3D).  We then focused on which specific bacteria are differentially abundant between mouse control chow and popular human diets. Several bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASV)s (Figure 2; Supplementary Table 3) and genera (Supplementary Figure 5; Supplementary Table 4) were found enriched or depleted in popular human diet patterns compared to control mouse chow. In general, the relative abundance of bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASV)s belong to family Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and genus Alistipes were consistently increased in human popular diets compared to mouse control chow (Figure 2), whereas Ruminiclostridium abundance was lower in human popular diets compared to the mouse control chow.",6a803205-ba35-4819-915e-d4bac873a3d4
15,results7," Similarly, a genus under the family Muribaculaceae was enriched; and Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Rombutisa, and Parabacteroides were depleted in human popular diets compared to control mouse chow (Supplementary Figure 5), indicating that mouse chow typically used in pre-clinical studies has a differential effect on gut microbiota compared to human-relevant diets and could alter interpretations of metabolic studies when only considering mouse chows.  Figure 2 Differential amplicon sequence variants (ASV) abundance between controlled mouse diet and four popular human diet patterns.

17,results9,"  Then to understand how WD contributes to higher metabolic diseases compared to other human diets used in this study, we focused on the differential bacteria abundance in MeD, KD, or JD diet patterns compared to WD. We found several differences in gut genera abundance in MeD, KD, and JD compared to the WD (Supplementary Table 5; Supplementary Figure 6). For instance, we found that relative abundance of short-chain fatty acids (short chain fatty acids (SCFA)) producing bacteria Faecalibaculum, Blautia, and Lactococcus were higher in KD, JD and MeD compared to WD. However, Ruminococcaceae UCG-005 abundance was lower in JD, KD, and MeD compared to WD. Unexpectedly, we found the abundance of Bifidobacterium was higher in WD compared to other diets in this study. However, as we discuss below, we cannot determine which species or subspecies of the Bifidobacterium are enriched in WD using a 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.",a0224595-1542-44e2-8aa2-b3c0a47ad8b2
18,results10," Other notable bacterial genera that were differentially abundant compared to WD were Akkermansia, Butyricicoccus, Anaeroplasma, Desulfovibrio, Lachnospiraceae, Odoribacter, Rikenella, Citrobacter, Dubosiella, Faecalibaculum, Roseburia, Ruminiclostridium 9, Streptococcus, Turicibacter, Muribaculum, and Parabacteroides, which varied among diets and mouse strains (Supplementary Table 5; Supplementary Figure 3D). These results indicate that the differential gut microbial abundance due to diet treatment is significantly influenced by background genetics. For example, only in non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ mice, Roseburia was significantly decreased in KD and JD while being increased in MeD (Supplementary Table 5). The differential amplicon sequence variants (ASV) abundance between diets also varied significantly depending on the mouse strain (Supplementary Table 6).",cafbd775-ac50-482d-959c-54f4a103c859
19,results11," For instance, an amplicon sequence variants (ASV) belongs to the genus Akkermansia was >4-fold higher only in C57BL/6J mice fed KD as compared to those fed a WD (Supplementary Table 6). This result indicates that depending on the background genetics of the host, the same diet may show significant heterogeneity in its effects on the enrichment or depletion of specific gut bacteria.  Diet and gut microbiota interact to affect host body composition  The gut microbiota is critical to digestion and thus variation in the gut microbiome can affect availability of energy substrates, host metabolism, and body composition. Therefore, we next focused on the association between gut microbiota and host body composition between diet groups. In the WD, all three microbial α-diversity measures were positively correlated with lean mass and negatively associated with body fat percentage (Figure 3A), indicating high microbial diversity is associated with better metabolic health.",d414bb17-3738-4074-96e4-7dcb63352b54
20,results12," However, α-diversity measures in the MeD, KD, and JD did not show any significant association with body composition, and Faith's PD and observed amplicon sequence variants (ASV) showed a positive correlation with body weight in controlled mouse chow. This result suggests a significant interaction between diet and α-diversity measures on body composition phenotypes. For example, Shannon diversity index explains 21, 0.3, 0.1, 7, and 50% variance of the body fat percentage respectively for control mouse chow, JD, KD, MeD, and WD, indicating a WD induces profound alteration in gut microbiome and dramatically affects body fat percentage (Table 1).

Next, we focused on the association between microbial β-diversity and body composition to understand the effect of the overall microbial composition. Since principal component 1 (PC1) explains most of the variability of multidimensional data (55), we determined the correlation between PC1 of β-diversity measures and clinical phenotypes and body composition phenotypes. This approach was previously used in the microbiome field to demonstrate the association between microbial β-diversity and a higher number of clinical or metabolic phenotypes (56–58).",d5ea0479-1764-461b-bd14-c9541d84554e
24,results18," Similar to measures of α-diversity, we observed that the WD has the most pronounced association between microbial β-diversity and body composition compared to other diets in the study (Figure 3A). The first principal component of Bray-Curtis β-diversity explains 11, 4, 1, 8, and 42% variance of the body fat percentage respectively for control mouse chow, JD, KD, MeD, and WD, indicating the changes in the microbial abundance due to diet treatment may explain the differential adipogenicity among diets (Table 1). The interaction between Bray-Curtis PC1 and diet on body fat percentage remained significant even after adjusting for sex as a covariate in the ANOVA model (Supplementary Table 8).  We then determined if any specific gut bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASV)s or genera are associated with body composition and found several gut bacteria were associated although the associations varied depending on diet composition (Supplementary Tables 9, 10).",8dc3f9c2-dcdb-4edf-b9c4-4d9a00716441

Conversely, the presence of Enterobacter, a bacterium under Proteobacteria phylum was associated with mice with lower body weight, fat mass, and lean mass, which was completely absent in mice with higher body weight, fat mass, and lean mass consuming MeD (Figure 3E; Supplementary Table 9). The differential amplicon sequence variants (ASV) abundance between high and low body composition phenotypes also varied depending on the dietary patterns (Supplementary Table 10).

27,results21,"  Diet and gut microbiota interact to affect host glucose metabolism  Glucose metabolism is an important part of the host metabolism and impaired glucose metabolism is directly related to metabolic diseases notably type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, we then focused on the interaction between diet and microbiome on host glucose metabolism. Consistent with the host body composition, a significant diet * microbiota interaction affecting glucose metabolism was observed. For instance, more pronounced associations between fasting blood glucose, glucose tolerance, and microbial α-diversity were observed with WD compared to other diets in the study (Figure 4; Supplementary Table 11). Faith's PD explained about 16, 0.4, 2, 4, and 37% variability in glucose tolerance test (GTT)-AUC for mouse control chow, JD, KD, MeD, and WD, respectively, indicating that the WD altered-gut microbiota influences host glucose metabolism the most among all study diets.",5e16f35a-7d19-49f3-a645-4e6435e70484

33,results27," To evaluate this hypothesis, next, we compared the association between gut microbiota and host body composition within each mouse strain. The microbial diversity correlated significantly with host body composition and the association showed significant interaction with mouse strains, with a more pronounced association in C57BL/6J mice (Figure 5A; Supplementary Tables 15, 16). For example, body fat percentage was significantly correlated with all three α-diversity measures only in C57BL/6J (Figure 5A). In particular, Faith's PD showed the strongest correlation with body fat percentage, which explained 9, 19, 13, and 0.2% of the variability of the body fat percentage, for A/J, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, and non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ mice (Table 2), respectively, indicating that C57BL/6J is the most susceptible to gut microbiome aletration.",e54d8349-63d5-4cda-91d0-2215b98a6a4f
34,results28," Similarly, Shannon diversity index, observed amplicon sequence variants (ASV), Bray-Curtis, and unweighted UniFrac also explained higher percent variance of body composition in C57BL/6J (Table 2), further supporting that C57BL/6J mice are more susceptible to obesity due to diet-induced alteration of microbiota compared to other strains in this study.

Both the differential amplicon sequence variants (ASV) and genera abundances reconfirmed the existence of significant host gene-microbiota interactions on glucose metabolism in the host.

A higher abundance of Ruminococcaceae UCG-014 in C57BL/6J was also associated with elevated insulin levels but was not significant (Figure 6D).

44,discussion0," Metabolic syndrome is a major global public health problem (6, 8), which carries a huge health care cost burden (7). It is well accepted that diet and nutrition play a central role in the development of metabolic diseases (59). In particular, a WD pattern contributes to the global epidemic of metabolic diseases (9, 60). Additionally, host genetics contributes to the susceptibility to diet-induced metabolic diseases (22, 61). Similar to the host's genome, gut microbiota, also known as a malleable third genome (62), plays an important role in metabolic diseases (23, 63). Therefore, it is important to not only study how genetics, diet, and gut microbiota affect metabolism and disease risk but also to take an integrative approach to understand how interactions among these factors affect an individual's metabolic health. Such an approach can further enrich our understanding of the underlying mechanism for the interindividual variation in susceptibility to metabolic diseases.",b8c7a999-2d08-46f7-8f9d-be371b05b613
45,discussion1," Our studies presented here are among several that have begun to model these interactions using mice (36, 64).  In this study, we treated four inbred mouse strains (A/J, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, and non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ) with four diverse diet patterns (Mediterranean diet, Japanese diet, ketogenic diet, Western diet), and a control mouse chow for 24 weeks starting from 6 weeks of age (22). We carefully selected four different inbred strains based on their phenotypic diversity and wider utilization within biomedical research, and the four diets were selected based on their effects on metabolic health. We previously reported that genetics is an important modulator of the diet effect on metabolic health (22) and here, we focus on perturbations to the gut microbiota and its interactions with diet, and host genetics to alter host metabolic health.",98b7833d-23c4-424f-8142-8f8a40feaf49
46,discussion2," Though several studies have evaluated diet and microbial effect on host metabolism, largely in C57BL/6J mice, the holistic approach that has been taken in this study using four different mouse strains and five diets is a major strength of our study. We report several key findings in this article including: (1) effect of popular human diets (MeD, KD, and JD) on gut microbiota in metabolically distinct inbred mouse strains; (2) gut microbial modulation of diet effect on host body composition and glucose metabolism; and (3) influence of host genetics on the association between microbiota and metabolic health. Each of these is discussed below.  Effect of popular human diets on gut microbiota  Analysis of the gut microbial diversity and composition suggests that diet has a stronger influence on gut microbiota than host genetics, which is consistent with a previous report (64). We observed several notable diet effects on microbial community structure which we briefly described.",7466bdb9-b60f-4d67-b1cb-faf88efa00cf
47,discussion3," Consistent with other studies (65), we observed that the microbial α-diversity increased in MeD groups compared to both WD and control mouse chow. MeD contains higher fruits, vegetables, whole-grain cereals, antioxidants, and polyphenols that have been hypothesized to support the survival and colonial expansion of diverse gut bacteria (65). Similarly, we observed that KD, which contains almost no carbohydrate, decreased the microbial α-diversity significantly across all mouse strains. Other studies have also found a reduction of gut microbial α-diversity of gut microbiota when mice are fed KD (66, 67). Since the large portion of the gut microbiota predominantly depends on undigested carbohydrates (68), it is expected that the very low carbohydrate in KD will decrease the microbial diversity. Additionally, the KD contains only a few, less diverse sets of ingredients (22), which also may cause the reduction of microbial diversity.",061710f1-ac5b-4b81-8c7a-e92d5bc9e835
48,discussion4," The effects of a KD may depend on genetics or disease state as the non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ mice did not have reduced diversity due to KD (also to other diets in the study). Usually, non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ develops diabetes at 10–14 weeks (69). Our non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ mice were 30 weeks old, and their insulin levels were nearly undetectable, indicating the development of severe insulin deficiency in these mice. One possibility is that the microbiota composition in non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ is determined by diabetic phenotype, which is well known to affect microbial diversity (27). Contrary to our hypothesis that a JD would dramatically affect α-diversity, the JD and WD-fed mice had similar α-diversity. Among the four popular diets in this study, JD was studied the least and we did not find any previous study that compared classical JD with WD.",5660aaa1-e833-4ed3-b4a1-b3aa9c8407f4
49,discussion5," However, one study found that the α-diversity of gut microbiota in individuals with habitual JD with higher JD score is not different than those who had a westernized low JD score diet (70), which supports that the JD may result in a microbial diversity similar to WD. However, JD has been found associated with better metabolic health compared to WD (22).  Diversity metrics are important, but the underlying composition of the gut microbiota (i.e., the specific microbes) also is important. Therefore, to understand the underlying microbial compositional differences between study diets, we next determined differential gut bacteria abundance in KD, JD, and MeD compared to WD. Consistent with the nutrient diversity, the underlying composition of gut bacteria was quite different among the study diets.",82354e15-2ee7-4596-aca7-b430baf4de74
50,discussion6," For example, we found that several gut bacteria abundances including Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Parabacteroides were higher in JD compared to WD, whereas, relative abundance of Odoribacter, Rikenella, and Staphylococcus were lower in JD compared to WD. Similarly, a genus under the family Muribaculaceae [previously referred to as S24-7 (71)] was enriched over four-fold in the gut microbiota of WD compared to JD in all mouse strains. These data suggest that a closer look at the underlying composition of bacteria in combination with microbial diversity is needed to completely understand the health effects of gut microbiota.  Gut microbiota modulate diet effect on host health  Beyond the regulatory effects that both diet and genetics have on the composition of the microbiota, it is important to understand the functional differences that altered gut microbiota have on clinical or disease related traits. Of particular interest are traits related to metabolic diseases.",304d9761-8c94-455e-8725-14696a202f16
51,discussion7," We highlight 2 specific examples from the current study. Determining the exact mechanisms for the effect of specific microbiota/diet interactions is difficult but evolving understanding of the metabolic consequences of specific gut bacteria does provide some clues. For example, we found that Akkermansia is associated with lower fasting blood glucose levels and glucose tolerance and insulin levels. Akkermansia is an anaerobic, intestinal mucin-degrading, a gut bacterium (72) uses mucin, has been found lower in diabetic patients (27) and is being considered as a potential probiotic for treating metabolic diseases (73). However, our study reveals that the inverse relationship between Akkermansia and diabetic phenotypes varies among the diets and was only observed significantly in WD-treated mice suggesting that the health effects of specific microbes may be found only within the context of a specific diet pattern.",d47faf30-68fc-4101-9dc5-bf6c2b4cce70
52,discussion8," One possible explanation is that WD induces metabolic inflammation (2) and Akkermansia and its membrane protein Amuc 1100 reduces inflammation through Toll-like receptor 2 (74). In addition to direct host cell signaling (ie- Amuc1100 and TLR2) there has been considerable interest in the local metabolic products produced by specific microbes and how they affect health. We identified a higher abundance of Faecalibaculum in MeD fed mice is significantly associated with a lower glucose tolerance which is consistent with literature suggesting that adherence to MeD reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (75). Faecalibaculum is known to be an efficient short chain fatty acids (SCFA) producer in the rodent gut bacterium (76), and higher concentrations short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in stool improves metabolic health (27). Our study results indicate that enrichment of some gut bacteria (e.g.",0c83c3a5-ce3d-449e-b88b-11e07bdd13e3
53,discussion9,", Faecalibaculum) and perhaps their ability to produce metabolites beneficial to the host might be responsible (at least partly) for some of the improved health outcomes ascribed to diet. Several studies have reported that Bifidobacterium improves metabolic health in humans (27, 77). Unexpectedly, we found Bifidobacterium to be positively associated with fasting blood glucose levels. Two important concepts could account for this surprising result. Bifidobacterium is a genus composed of 54 different species identified as of January 2017 (78), and not all Bifidobacterium are equal. Many of these species are animal host-specific, with evidence of vertical transmission from mothers to offspring (78, 79). Among different species of the Bifidobacterium, Bifidobacterium Longum subsp. infantis is the most beneficial to health (80). Some of the species in Bifidobacterium lineage including Bifidobacterium bifidum do not have this beneficial effect.",0999fe4c-487f-45a9-9cc0-4d279d5ed982
54,discussion10," With the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data, we only can identify genus level taxonomical information. Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis utilizes human milk oligosaccharides and is thus predominantly found in breastfed, human infants (81). Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis does not colonize in mice (82) which confounds Bifidobacterium comparisons across human and mouse studies. Thus, the positive association between Bifidobacterium and increased blood glucose levels is most likely not driven by Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis. Utilization of metagenomics is needed to completely understand the association between Bifidobacterium and carbohydrate metabolism in mice.  Influence of host genetics  The diversity and composition of the gut microbiota depend on several factors including the host's digestion, metabolism, and intestinal immunity (83, 84), all of which are influenced by host genetics (22, 85, 86).",be4ca17a-d647-4bb2-9db1-ac612fd79a46
55,discussion11," Therefore, it is expected that changes in gut microbiota due to diet will be different among individuals depending on the host genetics. The effect of dietary patterns on gut microbial α-diversity, β-diversity, and composition was heterogeneous and varied in effect size between mouse strains utilized in this study. This supports the notion that genetics is a critical underlying mediator of the diet-microbiome axis. For example, the non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ mice did not have reduced diversity due to KD (also to other diets in the study). Usually, non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ develops diabetes at 10–14 weeks (69). Our non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ mice were 30 weeks old, and their insulin levels were nearly undetectable, indicating the development of severe insulin deficiency in these mice. One possibility is that the microbiota composition in non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ is determined by diabetic phenotype which is well known to affect microbial diversity (27).",0732b5ff-1c5a-4df2-a331-86fa0963a241
56,discussion12," In addition to diversity, we also observed several differential bacterial abundances that vary depending on host genetics. For instance, Roseburia abundance in non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ mice was significantly increased in the KD and JD compared to WD but decreased in the MeD. Our study finding of the interaction between diet and host genetics on gut microbiota is in line with a few published reports. For example, a study (87) reported an interaction between diet and host genetics on microbiome using two inbred mice and two experimental diets. Similarly, another study has reported that different mouse strains have a different distribution of gut microbiota and enterotypes in C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BALB/cJ, non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ, and an outbred Swiss mouse strain (88).",2fc665ed-d101-470f-8471-024cec133842
57,discussion13," A recent study (89) showed that the alteration of gut microbial diversity and composition due to fructose consumption is different among C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and FVB/NJ mice strains, indicating diet * genetic interaction on gut microbiota similar to the current study.  Mice and humans share a similar genetic architecture which makes mice an efficient model for genetic research. The ability to control environmental exposures including diet makes it a widely used animal model for studying human health and diseases (90). Therefore, to better understand the influence of genetics on metabolic health, we determined the interactions between mouse strain and gut microbiota on host body composition and carbohydrate metabolism. As mentioned earlier, different mouse strains have different metabolic profiles (22, 85, 91).",287d7463-d796-4544-b160-c14fc7069d06
58,discussion14," Therefore, it is expected that host metabolic response to the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites will be different among the mouse strains because of their differences in genetic background. In our study, we found significant genetics * microbiota interaction on host body composition and metabolic health. Consistent with our findings, a recent study (89) determined that the correlations between host fructose-responsive genes expression, adiposity and gut microbial composition are modulated by host genetics. Additionally, they also found that gut microbiota in C57BL/6J is more likely to be correlated with adiposity compared to DBA/2J and FVB/NJ mice. We also found that the C57BL/6J mice have the strongest correlation between gut microbiota and body composition. We did not find a set of bacteria consistently associated with body composition and metabolic phenotypes across all study diets and mouse strains.",1b07796b-5ae7-4b32-821c-9b18a764882b
59,discussion15," Similar to ours, a recent study (92) also did not find a set of common gut bacteria is associated with cancer immune therapy across 5 different human cohorts. Our findings indicate the importance of considering both diet and genetics for designing probiotics for precision therapeutics.  One limitation is that this study did not determine sex-specific effects due to insufficient mouse number in the female group for some diet-mouse strain arms. Therefore, our study result was presented here as a combined effect on both sexes upon adjusting for sex as a covariate in the statistical model. A future study with adequate power is needed to determine the interactions between phenotype, mouse strain, diet, and biological sex. We only collected stool samples at the end of the study to measure microbiota.",afb5ff38-1b06-41b7-969b-74660240a56b
60,discussion16," Collecting more stool samples at multiple time points including a baseline would help us better understand the subtle and cumulative effect of diet on microbial composition and the dynamic association between microbiota and metabolic phenotype over time. Additionally, we did not perform a functional validation study with a fecal microbiota transplant (fecal microbiota transplant (FMT)) in this study, which would confirm the causality. More research with larger sample sizes is needed to determine the sex dimorphic nature of the associations between diet, microbiota, and genetics on metabolic health.  In conclusion, the present study demonstrates diverse diet patterns affect gut microbial community structure and that these can be influenced by host genetics. The interactions of diet and genetics likely contribute to the modulatory effects of diet plays in metabolic health.",a5ecb2f8-354a-446c-a789-cc1ff2d89d8e
