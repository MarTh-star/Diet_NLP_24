14,discussion6," This dish is composed of artichoke, serrano ham, onion, extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and iodized salt. Of these, artichoke has an important role because of its powerful hepatoprotective, anticarcinogenic, and hypocholesterolemic (Llorach, Espin, Tomas‐Barberan, & Ferreres, 2002), which are the result of its high phenolic compound content, principally caffeic acid derivatives and flavonoids (Tomás‐Barberán, Ferreres, & Gil, 2000). However, the significance of these compounds is not only due to their antioxidant properties, but also to their vasodilator, anti‐inflammatory, antibacterial, immune system stimulator, antiallergenic, antiviral, estrogenic, or prooxidant enzyme inhibitor effects (García Gabarra, 2006). These findings reflect the results obtained by Ferracane et al. (2008), who reported the antioxidant capacity of cooked artichokes.",6e00bea5-66f7-4edb-99c1-566875034564
15,discussion7," Another ingredient of the dish was onion, which is the only tuber that contains flavonoids, mainly quercetin 4′‐D‐glucosides, a compound with a high antioxidant power due to its ability to join biological polymers, hormone transporters and DNA, or chelate metal ions (Fe+2, Cu2+, Zn2+; Martínez‐Flórez et al., 2002). Serrano ham is a traditional product in the Mediterranean area, where it is especially value for its sensory characteristics. Because of its well‐balance nutritional profile, it can be included in a balanced diet, since it can generate beneficial effects in cardiovascular disorders (Jiménez‐Colmenero, Ventanas, & Toldrá, 2010). These benefits may be due to the high antioxidant capacity according to the results obtained by Joaquín Martínez, Nieto, and Ros (2014), who determined the antioxidant capacity of meat products was determined using the ORAC hydrophilic (ORACHF) assay. Olive oil is a fundamental part of the Mediterranean diet and the principal source of fat therein.",face99df-de75-4d9d-b635-474d385367fa
16,discussion8," It is considered one of the compounds responsible for the beneficial effects of the MD due to its antioxidant capacity. Olive oil is rich in phenolic compounds, particularly in hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein (Visioli, Poli, & Gall, 2002). Moreover, this oil is a natural source of the natural antioxidant, vitamin E, which acts to neutralize singlet oxygen (1O2), capture hydroxyl radical (OH•), capture oxygen (O2), and neutralize peroxides (Venereo Gutiérrez, 2002). Finally, lemon juice is rich in vitamin C, whose antioxidant action is due to its ability to neutralize 1O2, capture OH•, capture oxygen O2, and regenerate the oxidized form of vitamin E (Venereo Gutiérrez, 2002).  The least antioxidant sample was nº 16, whose ingredients include potatoes. Several studies have shown that potato contain bioactive compounds with antioxidant properties, such as polyphenols, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, tocopherols, and selenium (Nimse & Pal, 2015; Venereo Gutiérrez, 2002).",f6cd6333-3970-40b1-9401-22a0350fd0f0
17,discussion9," The ingredients also include tomato, which contains flavonoids, phenolic acids, carotenoids, ascorbic acid, and vitamin E, the last one responsible for the beneficial effects associated with this food (George, Kaur, Khurdiya, & Kapoor, 2004); garlic, whose therapeutical effects (hypolipidemic, antiatherosclerotic, hypoglycemic, anticoagulant, antihypertensive, antimicrobial, and hepatoprotective) may be due to the phenolic compounds and flavonoids it contains (Bozin, Mimica‐Dukic, Samojlik, Goran, & Igic, 2008); carrots, which are a good source of antioxidant compounds containing carotenes, vitamin C and phenolic compounds (Alasalvar, Grigor, Zhang, Quantick, & Shahidi, 2001); turmeric, with a high antioxidant activity due a phenolic compound named curcumin (diferuloylmethane; Kaur & Kapoor, 2002); onion and extra virgin olive oil, whose antioxidant compounds have been mentioned above.",5941bee6-c629-4035-b289-9b5b336a65e8
18,discussion10," Despite containing these ingredients rich in antioxidant and phenolic compounds, the lowest antioxidant capacity value of sample nº 16 is due to the way in which it is prepared (pressure‐cooking), which generates significant losses of up to 50% of the antioxidant capacity (Jiménez‐Monreal, García‐Diz, Martínez‐Tomé, Mariscal, & Murcia, 2009).  Samples 2 (kiwi), 3 (fruit salad), 6 (yogurt with kiwi), 7 (orange with cinnamon), 8 (whole wheat toast with tomato, olive oil and salt), 12 (gilthead sea beam in salt with grilled vegetables), 15 (zarangollo), 17 (lentil stew), 19 (boiled beans), and 20 (Murcian salad) showed intermediate values of ORACH, ranging from 400 to 800 µM ET/100 g. All these dishes contain vegetables and fruits rich in antioxidant compounds, which have not undergone aggressive cooking.",5a876e66-b7a5-4f8c-8b55-7982cf1b81a2
19,discussion11," Firstly, samples 2, 3, 6, and 7 contain fruits, such as kiwi (rich in vitamin E, folates, carotenoids and, especially, in vitamin C; López‐Sobaler, Aparicio Vizuete, Anta, & María, 2016) or orange (source of vitamin C and polyphenolic compounds; Klimczak, Małecka, Szlachta, & Gliszczyńska‐Świgło, 2007). Finally, samples 8, 12, 15, 17, 19, and 20 all shared one ingredient with a high antioxidant capacity—olive oil. Furthermore, they contain tomato, onion or potato, all with antioxidant properties. Additionally, taking as reference the results obtained by Martínez et al. (2014), the antioxidant effect of meat products and fish is also important in these samples: serrano ham, spicy pork sausage, gilthead sea bream, or tuna. In the above‐mentioned study, the antioxidant capacity of meat products was determined and compared with fish, vegetables, and milk. This study showed the high antioxidant capacity of meat and meat products compared to other animal products and vegetables.",50f31fa4-ef60-4a23-a3f1-56087c4d4319
20,discussion12," Moreover, the study confirmed that, even though heat treatment results in a lowering of antioxidant capacity, especially in the case of fish, the remaining antioxidant capacity remains significant.  In agreement with Saura‐Calixto and Goñi (2006), there is clearly a need to evaluate the antioxidant power by taking into account all the compounds forming part of the diet, since evaluating the antioxidant capacity of individual compounds tends to overestimate their antioxidant effects.  3.2 Antioxidant capacity of the diet The results obtained for the antioxidant capacity and total phenolic compounds for each day of the diet are shown in Table 3. As can be seen, the highest value for the antioxidant capacity and phenolic compounds is attained on day four, 13,184.01 ± 0.01 ET/100 g and 2,069.1 ± 0.01 GAE/100 g, respectively, while the lowest antioxidant capacity and phenolic compound content are attained on day one, 5,873.18 ± 0.01 ET/100 g and 1,582.22 ± 0.01 GAE/100 g.",def33413-3e88-40a2-a03a-5bfb41d5712d

John Wiley & Sons, LtdGonzález, Periago, and Alonso (2017) determined the average intake of phenolic compounds in Spanish people as 1,365,1 mg/day, which is clearly exceeded by the 1,839.05 GAE/100 g in the case of the diet of Murcia.",bc1b79ea-51e5-46b0-98cc-3bd13c4bc4d2
22,discussion15," In the same way, Ovaskainen et al. (2008) estimated the average consumption of phenolic compound in a Finnish population as 863 mg/day, underlining the higher intake of the Spanish population (particulary those who follow a diet typical of Murcia). According to Zamora‐Ros et al. (2013), consuming more than 600 mg of phenolic compounds per day increases life expectancy and the quality of life. Martínez et al. (2014) determined the total antioxidant capacity of a balanced diet should be at least 29,006 µmol ET/day. The total mean antioxidant capacity of the diet studied is 9,506.33 TE/100 g. Hervert‐Hernández et al. (2011) concluded that Mexican rural diet provides a low antioxidant capacity, estimated at around 1000–2000 µmol TE per day due to the low daily intake of fruits and vegetables. The differences in antioxidant capacity and phenolic compounds between these countries, then, seem to be due to the different consumption patterns of each country.  3.",e4a2505f-d2ac-4049-bb37-af834cfdf48c

25,discussion21," Considering that the 30% and 35% of the total energy intake comes from fat, 20% from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), 5% from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and a 7%–8% from saturated fatty acids (SFA), this diet described contributes 90.55% of the recommendations (RDA) of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), 100% of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and an 84.2% of saturated fatty acids (SFA).  As regards micronutrient levels, vitamins A, E, and C, and the minerals selenium and zinc meet recommended daily amount established in Spanish regulation (RD1669/2009). Furthermore, both vitamin and mineral levels agree with the maximum tolerable intake level determined by Mathioudakis (2015). The total mean intake of vitamin A suprasses the recommendations (RDA) and so covers 100% of the recommendations. Another point is that the consumption is below UL levels (Tolerable Upper Intake Level).",d00adf6a-9b10-4bff-875c-bc8c89208b26
26,discussion22," In the case of vitamin E, the average intake was 15 mg, compared to the recommended 12 mg, so that the 100% of the recommendations (RDA) of this vitamin is covered with the diet. Nevertheless, this level is below the UL level. Vitamin C intake was well above the recommendations (338 mg compared with the recommended 80 mg), again contributing 100% of what is needed, although the UL level has not been established for this vitamin. The level of selenium was above that recommended, with a range from 55 to 115 µg, but, at the same time, it was far below the UL; in other words, the diet covered the 100% of the recommendations (RDA). Finally, the recommendations (RDA) of zinc (10 mg/day) was covered by the diet, and, so once again, this represents the 100% of the recommendations (RDA).  4 ",f1d03f46-e999-4d43-81f0-6b5cdd68ad9c
27,conclusion0,"Using different methods (ORAC hydrophilic (ORACHF), ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), DPPH) to evaluate the antioxidant activity in vitro and the Folin–Ciocalteu method to evaluate the phenolic compound content, the results of this study show that the samples corresponding to typical dishes of the Murcia cuisine have a high antioxidant capacity and are rich in phenolic compounds, which contrasts with the results of a previous study evaluating individual ingredients. This could be due to the synergy of the compounds. Thus, the antioxidant capacity and phenolic compounds of the diet of the Region of Murcia suggest that this type of diet could have beneficial effects for health by reducing oxidative damage. In addition, the nutritional properties of the diet—rich in zinc and selenium, with a hight intake of carbohydrates with a low glycaemic index, low in fats, moderate levels of proteins—meet the nutritional objectives of Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (2011).",d298b205-893f-4766-bcb2-32ff17fc2cee
