0,methods0," Study design and participants  A cross sectional study was conducted from 24th April to 23rd May 2020, during which time Qatar was under the COVID-19 lockdown. Participants were recruited through social media (WhatsApp and Twitter) and by email using a snowball convenience sampling method. Respondents were asked to complete an online questionnaire anonymously that was distributed through social media and encouraged to distribute the questionnaire to their contacts residing in Qatar. The inclusion criteria was adults, aged 18 years or older, who were residents of Qatar during the spring 2020 lockdown. Those not residing in Qatar were excluded. Despite the initial sampling approach, it became apparent that snowball sampling was not followed by the majority of participants, rendering our sample more like a “convenient” sample rather than a “snowball” sample. Participants were asked to provide written informed consent prior to completing the questionnaire.",99e05abb-4b84-42ab-9957-0052b03ba46a
1,methods1," Ethical approval for this study was obtained from Qatar University Institutional Review Board (QU-IRB 1081-EA/19), and it was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  Questionnaire  The questionnaire consisted of 78 questions structured into 4 sections: (1) socio demographics, (2) dietary habits before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, (3) physical activity before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, and (4) personality, described in detail below.  Socio demographic data  Participants were asked to report their age (≤20 years; 21–29 years; 30–39 years; ≥40 years), gender (male or female), nationality (Arab or non-Arab), highest education level attained (secondary school, university undergraduate, university postgraduate), marital status (single, married, divorced), work status (student, employed, unemployed, retired), smoking status (yes or no), and weight and height during the lockdown.",2a4c4f63-918e-45be-98ed-bdd9ab042b62
2,methods2," Self-reported data on height and weight were used to calculate BMI (kg/m2) and interpreted according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification as underweight (BMI: <18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI: 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI: 25.0–29.9 kg/m2) and obese (BMI: ≥ 30 kg/m2).  Dietary assessment  Dietary habits were assessed using the MD Adherence Screener (MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) [25], which has been shown to be a valid tool for assessment of MD adherence [26]. The questionnaire comprised 14 questions which assessed the intake of: olive oil as the main fat, tablespoons of olive oil used, vegetables, fruit and fruit juices, meat and meat products, fats (butter, margarine, cream), sweet or carbonated beverages, wine, legumes, fish or shellfish, commercial sweets or pastries, unsalted nuts, poultry and sofrito sauce. Responses that were favorable to the adoption of the MD diet were scored as one point, while responses that were unfavorable were scored as zero.",7dd8afbc-b516-4015-b3e7-91c4b7157c7d
3,methods3," Taking into consideration cultural and religious practices in Qatar, the component related to alcohol (i.e., wine) consumption was not included in the questionnaire, leaving only 13 components of the MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score, and thus the score range of 0 (minimal level of adherence) to 13 (maximum level of adherence). Additionally, ‘ghee’ was added under the question regarding fat consumption since this is commonly used in Qatar.  Physical activity assessment  The short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-SF) [27] was used to assess physical activity. International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) is a validated tool extensively used to categorize individuals as having low, medium or high PA levels based on the frequency and duration of activities of various intensities and the time spent seated over the past 7 days [28].",7cf1b523-0341-4d85-90d2-558d7ab858b8
4,methods4," The weekly PA level was calculated as energy expenditure in Metabolic Equivalent Task-minutes/week (MET-min/week.), using the assigned MET for each task (3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate-intensity PA, and 8.0 for vigorous-intensity PA). Computations of MET-min/week were calculated following the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) recommendations for scoring protocol [27].  Personality  Personality traits were assessed using the 44-item validated short version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) [29], which classifies these traits into five broad dimensions: agreeableness, extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness based on the five factor model. Participants were asked to report their level of agreement on a 5-point scale ranging from 1—strongly disagree to 5—strongly agree. The BFI-44 is one of the most commonly used instruments in studies about personality, given its reliability and validity in diverse and cross-cultural samples [30].",c8c44b7b-6d6f-4dc6-a652-fb9e5015a797
5,methods5," Participants were asked to report their level of agreement with statements about how they see themselves on a five-point scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. An eight-item scale was used to assess agreeableness (e.g., “I see myself as someone who is helpful and unselfish with others”). A nine-item scale was used to assess extraversion (e.g., “… is outgoing, sociable”). A nine-item scale was used to assess conscientiousness (e.g., “… does a thorough job”). An eight-item scale was used to assess neuroticism (e.g., “… gets nervous easily”). A ten-item scale was used to assess openness (e.g., “… is curious about many different things”). Items were reverse scored where necessary, and the mean was taken across items for each trait, with higher scores indicating a higher observance of the traits. ",7731ae7b-c699-4447-ba3f-67bf67f89003
6,analysis0," Distribution of numeric variables was assessed using normality plots. Paired t-tests were used to determine the association between paired numeric variables, the McNemar test for paired binary variables and Bowker’s symmetry test for categorical variables with >2 categories (e.g., MD adherence: low, moderate, high), before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Association of personality dimensions with dietary habits (MD adherence) and PA were investigated in multiple linear regression models using personality as the main independent variable of interest. No adjustments were made in the first regression model, while the second model was adjusted for gender, age, nationality, education, marital status, employment, smoking and BMI. A power analysis was conducted, which revealed that with a sample of 485 and above we have 80% power to detect a small size effect (d = 0.02) with α error of 0.05, in our linear regression models including nine predictor variables (personality plus 8 covariates).",3ebf1f9b-99fb-484e-8bf4-a34df6ec0eb2
7,analysis1,"  Descriptive data are presented as number and percentage in parentheses (%) for categorical variables and mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables. Results from the linear regression models represent the mean difference (95% CI) in each numeric outcome of interest (MD adherence and PA) by personality (agreeableness acts as reference category). Results were considered statistically significant if the p-value was < 0.05. Data analysis was performed using STATA (Version 16, Stata Corporation, and College Station, TX, USA).

8,results0," Participants socio demographic characteristics  Six hundred and five online questionnaires were sent out, of which a total of 560 (92.5% response rate) participants responded and completed. Seventeen were excluded due to incomplete data, leaving a final sample of 543 participants. The demographic characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1. In brief, most of the participants were female (89%) and almost half (45%) were aged between 21 and 29 years. Most were Arab (73.7%), students (46%), held an undergraduate level of education (77.7%), single (63.4%) and nonsmokers (91.9%). Regarding body weight, 31.3% were classified as overweight (BMI = 25.0–29.9 kg/m2) and 13.3% were classified as obese (BMI = ≥30 kg/m2). With respect to personality, the majority of participants scored highly in openness (41.4%). Females were overrepresented among those scoring highly in agreeableness (95.5%), and males were overrepresented among those scoring highly in conscientiousness (28.",99172338-cf59-40f3-931a-45b98c5d5ffc
9,results4," During lockdown, 41.6% of participants were classified as having low adherence (score ranged from 1–5), 51% as moderate adherence (score ranged from 6–8) and 7.4% as high adherence to the MD (score ranged from 9–11, p < 0.001).  10.1371/journal.pone.0276426.g001 Fig 1 A Dietary Habits Before and During COVID-19 Lockdown: MD Adherence Score Before and During Lockdown.  * indicates statistically significant differences in MD adherence score before and during lockdown, at the 5% significance level, using paired t tests.

The breakdown of the MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS) components before and during the COVID-19 lockdown in Qatar are presented in Fig 1C. A statistically significant increase was seen in the percentage of participants who consumed four or more tablespoons of olive oil per day (9% vs. 12%; p < 0.001); two or more servings of raw or cooked vegetables per day (54.3% vs. 58.7%; p = 0.005); three or more servings of legumes per week (11.8% vs. 15.3%; p = 0.007) and two or more servings of ‘sofrito’ per week (70.9% vs. 77.3%; p < 0.",c27c22b1-8c04-4e63-a1b1-0c52e26a29c5

On the other hand, the percentage of participants who consumed three or more servings of fresh fruit or fruit juice per day (39.4% vs. 15.8%; p < 0.001) and three or more servings of fish or seafood per week (5.9% vs. 3.9%; p = 0.035) significantly decreased during lockdown compared to before lockdown. Additionally, there was a significant increase in the percentage of participants who consumed less than one serving of fats (such as butter, margarine, ghee or cream) per day, when comparing before with during the lockdown (45.9% vs. 53.8%; p < 0.001).  Physical activity before and during the COVID-19 lockdown  Responses to the physical activity questionnaire completed before and during the COVID-19 lockdown are presented in Fig 2. The total physical activity was significantly reduced from 1836.7 ± 2087.9 MET-min/week before COVID-19 lockdown compared to 1330.5 ± 1663.7 during COVID-19 lockdown (B = -506.26; 95% CI = -678.60, -333.92; p < 0.",9d6e87bf-9211-4011-9a37-31c40286938e

After adjusting for confounders, the association remained robust for extraversion (B = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.04, 1.64; p = 0.039), whereas the association with conscientiousness decreased and became marginally non-significant (p = 0.060). During the COVID-19 lockdown, those with higher scores for conscientiousness had higher MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores compared to agreeableness (B = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.05, 0.90; p = 0.027). This association, however, was attenuated after adjusting for confounders in model 2. Concerning the change in MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score, both extraversion (B = -0.61; 95%CI = -1.18, -0.49; p = 0.033) and openness (B = -0.29; 95% CI = -0.56, -0.02; p = 0.036) scores did not change as much compared to agreeableness before and during lockdown.",2a3c2388-5393-4d3c-9e5c-60d9b829f919
13,results11," After adjusting for confounders, however, the association remained robust only for those with high openness scores (B = -0.31; 95% CI = -0.58, -0.04; p = 0.026). The changes in MD scores for each category can be seen in S1 Table.  Personality and physical activity before and during the COVID-19 lockdown  Associations of personality dimensions and PA before and during the COVID-19 lockdown are presented in Table 3. Among the personality dimensions examined, and using the agreeableness personality trait as the reference, those who scored high in openness were more likely to engage in all PA (B = 562.2; 95% CI = 62.7, 106.7; p = 0.027), including walking (B = 241.7; 95% CI = 29.4, 454.0; p = 0.026), before lockdown, even after adjusting for confounders. Those with high openness scores were also least likely to be sitting (B = -303.4; 95% CI = -590.0; -16.8; p = 0.038) when compared to those with high agreeableness scores before lockdown.",9cbd5915-2db7-4465-bb77-440621672dc1
14,results12," During lockdown, this association became less apparent and did not reach statistical significance.

15,discussion0," To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the association between personality and lifestyle habits such as diet and exercise during the COVID-19 lockdown in Qatar. This adds to previously conducted research in other population groups which mainly focused on lifestyle without considering personality and provides evidence to further understand the association between lifestyle and personality during such unprecedented and difficult circumstances. Noticeably, there was a reduction in MD adherence during lockdown in the study population. Although lockdown was associated with an increase in olive oil, vegetables, legumes, sofrito and fat consumption, there was also a significant reduction in fresh fruit and fish/seafood consumption during lockdown. Total PA (vigorous and moderate activity) and walking were reduced during lockdown, while the time spent sitting was increased compared to before lockdown.",16822185-0abe-4e8b-b1ed-ff1dc577aca3
16,discussion1," Certain personality types such as extraversion had higher MD adherence before but not during lockdown. Openness was associated with no change in the MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score during lockdown. Participants who scored high in openness were more likely to engage in PA (vigorous and moderate) and walking and less likely to be sitting before lockdown. Additionally, during lockdown, those who scored high in neuroticism were less likely to be sitting.  Concerning demographics, women scored highly in the agreeableness dimension, which was also reported in other studies in various cultures [31]. In contrast, however, we found that the majority of men scored high in the conscientiousness dimension, which contradicts some studies that reported women as having higher scores in this dimension [31]. This finding, however, is not consistent across various cultures [32], which could explain our findings.",b9215420-2622-437f-96a2-aacb56d5628a
17,discussion2," With regard to BMI, our finding of high agreeableness levels being associated with underweight or normal body weight is consistent with previous studies [33]. Those who were overweight or obese scored high in the openness dimension, and this contradicts other studies which reported that those who scored high in openness were less likely to be overweight or obese [33]. This could also be due to cultural differences.  Overall, our study found a significant but small reduction in the MD adherence score during the COVID-19 lockdown by an average of 0.2 points. This contrasts with other studies in Spain and Chile, where participants had adopted MD eating patterns during lockdown [34, 35]. As suggested by Di Renzo et al. [36], the MD could be one of the best food models for strengthening immunity and protecting against COVID-19.",d65411d0-a4bc-4fa0-b749-a1682ada0db6
18,discussion3," Therefore, reduced adherence to the MD could compromise nutritional quality, reduce the intake of foods high in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and as a result increase susceptibility to viral infections. Our findings on worsening eating habits, such as a decrease in fresh fruit and fish/seafood and an increase in fat consumption, were also similarly observed in other studies [37, 38]. A study on French adults reported that individuals bought fewer fresh products such as fruit due to limited shopping and a lack of access to their usual food shops, leading to the replacement of fruits with frozen vegetables [39]. Similarly, a study in Kuwait [40] also reported an overall significant reduction in fish and seafood consumption. The decrease in fresh fruit and seafood consumption in our findings was expected, since both fish and fruit markets in Qatar were closed during lockdown.",d596c637-adca-456c-8319-946bd325f7db
19,discussion4," It is also culturally preferred to consume fresh rather than frozen fish, therefore contributing to this reduction in consumption. On the other hand, there was an improvement in some dietary components in our study during lockdown, such as the consumption of more olive oil, vegetables, legumes and sofrito, similarly reported in Spanish [34] and Cypriot studies [41]. Similarly, another study looking at food behavior and consumption in Qatar found that 32.4% of respondents increased their consumption of vegetables during lockdown [3]. These findings could be explained by the increased consumption of locally produced legumes and vegetables due to food safety concerns and the uncertainty of the origins of imported food [3].  With regard to PA, all types (vigorous, moderate and walking) were significantly reduced during lockdown, while sitting was increased.",f9b87cb7-d931-40f4-ba36-3662fc91dc0f
20,discussion5," These results were expected considering the country was under lockdown and there was no access to gyms or permission to freely leave the house. Our findings are similar to other studies that reported a significant reduction in PA due to the limitations during lockdown [10]. Similarly, Abed Alah et al. [8] and Hermassi et al. [9] both reported a reduction in all PA activities and an increase in daily sitting time in the Qatari population. Our findings, however, do contradict other studies that reported an increase or maintenance of physical activity during lockdown [11, 12].  With regards to personality and diet associations, our study did find that extraversion was associated with a higher MD adherence before lockdown. This is similar to another study by Mottus et al. [42], who reported that those with high scores of extraversion followed a Mediterranean style diet.",5616e907-bcc7-4b58-a4f7-88d14628dc9f
21,discussion6," However, our results suggest that no personality dimension was correlated with MD adherence during lockdown, after adjusting for confounders. This was not expected, as previous studies reported that those who score high in conscientiousness are known to be organized and therefore practice dietary restraint and tend to follow a healthy dietary pattern [43, 44]. Furthermore, the MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score did not change during the lockdown for those with high scores for the openness personality dimension. This is not surprising, since high levels of openness have been associated with a Mediterranean style dietary pattern in previous studies [42, 45]. Openness has also been linked to resilience and ability to adapt to adverse life events [45], which could explain why there was no observed change in MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score during the pandemic in our study.",0fb30ae3-9012-4d0a-8755-f8be7695ec4a
22,discussion7,"  In relation to personality and its association with PA, those with high scores for the openness personality dimension were associated with all PA (vigorous, moderate and walking), and spent less time sitting before the lockdown. However, there was no association with any personality and PA during the lockdown. This is contradictory to a recent study by Stephan et al. [21], that reported that those high in conscientiousness and agreeableness and low in neuroticism were associated with an increase in physical activity during the pandemic. Interestingly, though, in our study, those who scored high in neuroticism spent less time sitting compared to other personality dimensions, even after adjusting for confounders. Although evidence indicates that high neuroticism is associated with poor outcomes [46], typically stable personality traits change in response to distress [47].",444dd679-ece9-43a8-b747-1cffedb2a8a8
23,discussion8," As an example, a study during the COVID-19 outbreak in Canada reported changes in the five-factor model personality trait [48]. Neuroticism, for instance, decreased across six weeks of lockdown, indicating that feelings of anxiety and distress associated with this personality dimension could be attributed to the pandemic itself rather than one’s personality traits [48]. Furthermore, they reported acute personality changes related to isolation in those with conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism and openness traits. Our findings similarly suggest acute changes and instability of the five factor personality traits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely that those who score high in the neuroticism dimension are less likely to spend their time sitting to avoid risky behavior out of worry and perceived fear of the pandemic.",35181dd6-dce9-4f38-8a84-bbeda1914b98
24,discussion9," A few studies showed that those who score high in neuroticism tend to be physically active [49], vigilant about their health [50] and are compliant with policies that would increase their safety [51]. A study by Abdelrahman et al. [52] on Qatari residents looked at social distancing practices during the COVID-19 pandemic and found that neuroticism was positively correlated with adopting social distancing. Furthermore, Aschwanden et al. [16] concluded that those who are neurotic adopt health-promoting behaviors unexpected during normal circumstances possibly due to the anxiety and fear evoked by the pandemic.  Nevertheless, studies that have examined health behaviors and personality traits during the COVID-19 pandemic are scarce. A recent study on a Finnish population of women aged 47–55 years investigated the association between personality and changes in health behaviors and depressive symptoms during the pandemic [23].",8eeafbfa-c418-41f4-b626-8138bf722290
25,discussion10," They reported a decrease in alcohol consumption and changes to healthier eating habits during the pandemic in women with higher extraversion personality. On the other hand, women who scored high in neuroticism had both healthy and unhealthy eating habits [23]. This highlights that anxiety provoked maladaptive and vigilance behaviors, which can occur in the neuroticism personality dimension, and was similarly found in our study with regard to time spent sitting.  The above findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 lockdown had variable impacts on the health behaviors of individuals. Understanding the links between personality and health behaviors can potentially target future policies and interventions aiming to improve eating habits and physical activity in the context of responses to unprecedented situations, such as the COVID-19 lockdown.",ec3cf4e9-5024-4025-9bea-1be7c6c98445
26,discussion11," Although an individual’s personality may predict eating and physical activity behavior changes under normal circumstances [53], these associations were not evident during the lockdown, suggesting that personality may not be as strong a determinant during this period. These findings are thus useful in pointing out that healthy dietary and physical activity behaviors should be encouraged for all personality types during exceptional circumstances. Nevertheless, longitudinal assessments of longer duration and in different populations on how personality impacts health behaviors are required to further understand the impact over time and among different populations. In addition, future research should consider the cultural dimensions that are weaved into observed individual differences, measured by the different personality inventories.  This study presents some strengths and limitations.",a7d7a02b-0ec4-4e18-9208-bc829cf89fe0
27,discussion12," The main strength of this study was that it provided, for the first time, observational data on associations between diet, PA and personality dimensions during the COVID-19 lockdown in Qatar. Futhermore, this study used assessment tools (MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-SF) which are validated and widely used instruments for assessing MD adherence and PA habits, respectively. With regard to limitations, the cross-sectional design of the study does not allow us to draw conclusions on cause-and-effect relationships. Moreover, dietary and PA changes were self-reported, and therefore might be susceptible to recall bias based on the ‘before lockdown’ component. Thirdly, the study population had a high proportion of participants who were single, female students, aged 21–29 years with an undergraduate degree education level, thus limiting the generalizability of the findings.",d4827630-9d86-4d72-9675-191467cb1ee8
28,discussion13," This was due to the oversampling of networks related to the non-random convenient sampling method, and as recruitment was conducted mostly through social media, it mainly targeted younger people. Although validated tools were used, online surveys have inherent limitations due to their subjective interpretations and perceptions. Lastly, at the time of conducting our study, there was no research on personality and thus no reason to believe that the COVID-19 lockdown would have any effect on personality traits. Since then, there is a study that does suggest that the pandemic could change certain personality traits [47]. Longitudinal studies with representative samples should be conducted to better understand the lasting effects of the COVID-19 lockdown and the restrictions put in place on dietary and PA habits, their changes over time and associations with the different personality dimensions.",78e2a60f-3beb-411d-8ae1-51fbae390020
29,discussion14,"  Conclusions  The present study provided, for the first time, information on eating habits and PA habits during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Qatar as well as associations with personality. Our results reveal a reduction in PA and changes in eating habits during the lockdown period. Personality types were associated with dietary habits and PA mainly before rather than during lockdown. Poor dietary habits, together with an unhealthy lifestyle, can cause serious health problems; therefore, adverse lifestyle changes during lockdown periods should be considered carefully. Although our study was conducted in Qatar, our findings may be generalized to other populations with similar demographic characteristics, due to the similarities of lockdown measures across the world. Future work will need to address whether there are long-term changes in diet and exercise habits and how these are associated with different personality dimensions in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",8fbd552d-ed61-40af-84fc-4d5bb6dd62c3
