0,background0,"According to the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)), cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, being responsible for 18 million deaths annually [1]. Coronary artery disease (coronary artery disease (CAD)) is considered the main cardiovascular disorder, and approximately 46 % of the cardiovascular mortality in men and 38 % in women is attributed to coronary artery disease (CAD) [2].  About 80 % of all mortality from cardiovascular disorders could be prevented if obesity, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity were excluded from the general population [3] and the adherence to a higher-quality diet is associated with decreased mortality risk [4]. In this meaning, the Mediterranean Diet (MeDiet), which incorporates the traditional healthy living habits of people from countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, has been consolidated as a dietary pattern highly associated with reduced cardiovascular [5] and mortality risk [6].",3b0eb3a3-1740-473d-b591-07791e45b933
1,background1," Besides, adherence to a MeDiet pattern seems to be strongly related to cardiovascular protection when compared to low-fat dietary patterns [5, 7].  Nuts (rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids – PUFA) and olive oil (rich in monounsaturated fatty acids – MUFA) are highly used in the Mediterranean cuisine [8]. Despite regular intake of nuts and olive oil seems to be inversely associated with cardiovascular risk factors, coronary artery disease (CAD) and mortality in some populations [9–11], these effects have not been observed in all studies, mainly in non-Mediterranean countries [12, 13]. The PREDIMED (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) study was a larger clinical trial that randomly assigned participants who were at high cardiovascular risk (but with no cardiovascular disease) to one of three diets: a MeDiet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil (minimum 50 ml/day) or with mixed nuts (30 g/day), or a control diet (low-fat diet).",7f4870a4-e167-4bbd-aff9-8faaead2638b
2,background2," The PREDIMED study showed that both MeDiets supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduced, by approximately 30 %, the incidence of major cardiovascular events in a European population [5].  Beyond unhealthy diet, genetic factors are strongly associated with the development and the progression of cardiovascular diseases [14]. The CD36 (CD36 molecule (thrombospondin receptor)) and the STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (acute-phase response factor)) genes are both related to pathways involved in the genesis of coronary artery disease (CAD) [15, 16], and may interact with dietary factors. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)) rs1761667 G>A in the CD36 gene has been associated with a higher intake of dietary fats and obesity [17], and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs8069645 A>G in the STAT3 gene seems to interact with higher saturated fat intake and increases the risk for abdominal obesity [18].",a0534950-c090-445d-ab11-1892ef7796de
3,background3," However, the association of these single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s with cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipid profile and inflammatory markers, and a possible interaction with different dietary fats are poorly understood in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).  Therefore, we design a randomized clinical trial to investigate the interaction of genetics with cardiovascular risk factors in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD) who do not live in the Mediterranean region, according to dietary prescription with different supplementary fats used in the MeDiet.  Methods/design Study design and centers The GENUTRI study is a single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, 12-week pragmatic clinical trial (blinded outcome assessment).",174f8753-46f4-4744-8943-8b0b2a609cb8

21,discussion0,"As previously described, the PREDIMED study showed that a MeDiet supplemented with mixed nuts (walnuts, almonds and hazelnuts) or olive oil reduces the incidence of major cardiovascular events in patients at high cardiovascular risk [5]. The PREDIMED study was conducted in Spain; in our study, instead of a classical MeDiet, participants receive a meal plan according to their daily caloric needs (maintenance or reduction of body weight), based on Brazilian guidelines [21–24], and all supplements used in our protocol (olive oil and pecan nuts) are supplied by local producers from southern Brazil. Besides, the amount of daily olive oil prescribed (30 ml/day) to our participants is lower than PREDIMED study, and it was adapted to the dietary habits of Brazilian individuals, who are not used to ingesting very large quantities of olive oil.  It is known that there may be some variations in the chemical composition of olive oil and nuts according to the geographical area where they are grown.",a1c75889-ed18-4b4d-bd34-1ac1d2728102
22,discussion1," Luna et al. [29] evaluated 39 samples of olive oil from eight producing countries; all olive trees were grown under the same conditions and the fruits were harvested at the same stage of maturation. Although the oil was extracted through the same process, these authors identified about 64 different volatile compounds, showing that the geographical area of the olive tree cultivation may be responsible for specific characteristics of olive oil, which could reflect on its beneficial effects [29, 30].  In our study, we are using a Spanish variety of olive oil (Arbequina), one that is also cultivated and produced in southern Brazil. A recent study showed that Brazilian olive oils have a high content of phenolic compounds, levels that are comparable to those in olive oils produced in other countries [31]. Noteworthy is the fact that beyond olive oil, the chemical composition of unsaturated fatty acids from pecan nuts is also influenced by its place of cultivation [32].",b51dbaa3-7426-419e-8af3-0e22666ad81a
23,discussion2,"  Although American, European and Asian clinical trials have shown consistent interactions between genetic polymorphisms, diets and the modulation of biochemical cardiovascular markers, there are few reports from Brazilian individuals. Barcelos et al. [33], for instance, showed that the -278A>C (rs3808607) polymorphism in the CYP7A1 gene can modify serum triglyceride concentrations in response to a reduced fat diet in a dyslipidemic male population; in other study, the consumption of 1 unit of Brazil nuts a day increased the selenium status and the glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) activity in obese women, regardless of the GPx1 Pro198Leu polymorphism [34]. The Brazilian population is considered one of the most ethnically mixed in the world [35], and this must be considered before all interpretations regarding genetic studies.",22b6f3de-3721-430e-8171-a20bed0a3856
24,discussion3," In populations in which the substructure created by inter-ethnic cross further increases the fluidity of racial and/or ethnic labels, extrapolation of nutrigenetic data from well-defined ethnic groups should be made with caution. To impact positively on global health, nutrigenomics must broaden its scope of investigation with respect to both target and population diversity, to avoid the risk of contributing to the creation of a genomics that is divided between regions and nations.  The randomized controlled GENUTRI trial is designed to explore three different dietary approaches for cardiometabolic and inflammatory profile improvement in patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD).",e4eed80d-5947-4df3-ad94-170170f9eb40
25,discussion4," The dietary approaches suggested by the Brazilian guidelines for individuals at very high cardiovascular risk are largely recommended in our country, and consist of 50–60 % of dairy energy from carbohydrates, 10–15 % from proteins, 25–35 % from total fats, <7 % from saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)), <20 % from MUFA, <10 % from PUFA, <1 % from trans fats, <200 mg/day from dietary cholesterol, 20–30 g/day from fiber and <2400 mg/day of sodium [21–24]. In Brazil, the effects of a modified MeDiet were evaluated by only one small study with 40 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, with mixed and inconsistent results [36]. The GENUTRI study is the first adequately powered clinical trial focusing on nuts or olive oil supplementation in a southern Brazilian population.",069dd885-549b-43ae-a20c-504e5b282e77
26,discussion5," Since it may be difficult for Brazilian individuals to adhere to and maintain a traditional MeDiet pattern, the study findings will have important implications not only for our population but also for the feasibility of other potential applications for the long-term prescription of cardioprotective foods in individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally, we will try to demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms linked to cardiovascular disease may modulate the effects of different diets on biochemical and inflammatory markers.  A large randomized clinical trial has been recently proposed in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) based on novel dietary interventions with the potential for low cost and high feasibility for use in Brazil [37]. However, this protocol does not consider genetic differences regarding the interbred Brazilian population.",71ef180b-f3d6-4c01-9258-a830ae220137
27,discussion6," The GENUTRI trial aims also to stimulate the consumption of local foods since the olive oil and pecan nuts provided in the study are cultivated and produced in our country by farmers on a small scale. If effective, it may contribute to economic growth in southern Brazil by encouraging the consumption of these foods. Besides, our results may generate hypotheses for larger randomized clinical trials regarding nutrigenetic approaches in different Brazilian regions.  In conclusion, although many studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of the MeDiet and/or dietary intake of olive oil and nuts on cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers, clinical trials evaluating these foods in Brazilian/non-Mediterranean populations with coronary artery disease (CAD) are scarce. Besides, the assessment of specific genetic polymorphisms may help to understand the individual different responses to specific dietary intervention.
