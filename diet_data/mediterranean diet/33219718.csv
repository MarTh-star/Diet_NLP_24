0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design  A prospective cohort study was conducted, with two lifestyle multi-component interventions (in-person supervised exercise cohort and remotely supervised exercise cohort), following the statement “Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology” (studies in Epidemiology” (STROBE)) [41].  The study protocol adheres to the “Ethics Guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki”, the last modification produced in 2011. It has the approval of the regional ethics committee of the Community of Madrid (CEIm) (record nº 05/20, EC 42/19). All participants signed informed consent before participating in the study.  2.2. Participants  The participants of both cohorts were university employees that were selected by convenience sampling from the occupational health service. At two different times, December 2018 and December 2019, informative meetings of the intervention were held.",84432e63-f47e-42ec-bbd4-e0cb466c8abf
1,methods1," To see if they met the inclusion criteria, employees interested in participating in the intervention filled out the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Score (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Score (MEDAS)), the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale (University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale (URICA)), and the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ)).  The inclusion criteria were the following: (1) University employees, adults; (2) Not complying with 2010 the World Health Organization (WHO) PA recommendations [42]; (3) Having a score inferior or equal to 9 in the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Score (MEDAS) questionnaire, which means poor adherence to the Mediterranean diet [43]; (4) being in the contemplation stage, which means a predisposition to change, according to the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale (URICA) questionnaire [44].",558e7a8e-f5af-446f-b255-7c2198a92b03
2,methods2,"  The exclusion criteria were having chronic diseases or musculoskeletal injuries that contraindicate physical exercise.  2.3. Lifestyle Intervention  The first cohort, the in-person supervised exercise group (in person supervised exercise group (ISEG)) started in January 2019 a multi-component intervention. Before that, the participants received a detailed report on their lifestyle habits such as PA, sedentary behavior, or diet, and the possible long-term consequences on their health. In the first place, an educational program on healthy habits was carried out in which the participants viewed 12 weekly videos on different topics: (1) Motivation for change; (2) Nutrients,",fb38c941-d24b-4e91-8dd4-912d937209b1
3,methods3," fiber and water; (3) Frequency of eating; (4) Breakfast and snacking; (5) From the food market to your dining table; (6) Circadian rhythms; (7) Physical activity recommendations; (8) False food and physical exercise myths; (9) Body composition healthy values; (10) Chronic diseases; (11) Nutritional strategies; (12) Physical exercise strategies. Three weeks after starting this first component, the diet program started in parallel, consisting of nine face-to-face weekly healthy eating workshops of 90 mins duration. In these workshops, the participants practiced diet planning following the Mediterranean diet pattern, addressed barriers to change, and reinforced the nutritional concepts of the educational program.",18854a4f-94be-46da-9c40-5597c7b4c805
4,methods4," Once the nutrition component was finished, an in-person-supervised physical exercise program was carried out, lasting for lasted six weeks, with 18 sessions of 60 mins each, with a frequency of three weekly sessions, combining strength and resistance exercises, and following 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations.  The typical training session consisted of a 10-min warm-up of mobility exercises; a 40-min main part consisting of a strength circuit training with 2–3 sets of 12–15 repetitions of 7–8 exercises involving major muscle groups, at an intensity of 7 to 8 ratio Borg scale of perceived exertion (RPE), with a rest of 30 s between exercises and 1 min between sets, and then aerobic exercise (treadmill walking or stationary cycling) at an intensity of 7 to 8 on the revised category-ratio Borg scale of perceived exertion (ratio Borg scale of perceived exertion (RPE)); and a 10-min cool down consisting of flexibility exercises.",3a2cf549-a1a4-496a-8b68-f1c654878584
5,methods5,"  The second cohort, the remotely supervised exercise group (remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG)), started the same program in January 2020. The difference was that at the end of the diet component, the Spanish government ordered a strict stay-at-home lockdown to stop the expansion of the COVID-19 outbreak, so the physical exercise program was remotely supervised in real-time, as the participants were at home. In this exercise program, with the same characteristics as that of the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG), the participants performed self-loading strength exercises and performed aerobic exercise jogging at home since they did not have specific training material or large spaces [40].",7b889cee-dec3-4837-b4b2-e75cc2e57124
6,methods6,"  For each participant, the diet workshops were in-person supervised by two nutritionists for both cohorts, while the physical exercise programs were supervised by two PA professionals, in-person (in person supervised exercise group (ISEG)) and remotely (remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG)) (Figure 1).  2.4. Place of the Intervention and Times of Assessments  The diet workshops were carried out at the university campus facilities during the employees’ workday for the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) and remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG). The in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) performed the PA program at the university campus facilities, while the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) performed it at home, with remote supervision, due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Both cohorts were evaluated before the multi-component intervention (T1) and six months after completion of it (T2).  2.5. Variables  2.5.1.",0c020f83-c2b2-454f-8721-69dd6ee48f20
7,methods7," Lifestyle  To analyze lifestyle, the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP-II) questionnaire was filled out. It consists of 52 items that are answered as N (never, 1 point), S (sometimes, 2 points), O (Often, 3 points), and R (Routinely, 4 points). This questionnaire consists of six subscales: Health responsibility (9 items), Physical activity (8 items), Nutrition (9 items), Spiritual growth (9 items), Interpersonal relations (9 items), and Stress management (8 items). The score for each scale is calculated using the means of the items [45,46]. Concerning the health-promoting lifestyle total score, the minimum is 52 and the maximum 208. It is considered a low score and therefore an inadequate lifestyle 52–90, moderate score and an improvable lifestyle 91–129, good lifestyle 130–168, and excellent lifestyle 169–208 [47].",d3d4c6e5-3183-4672-a484-7d7e9519759e
8,methods8,"  To analyze another of the specific components of lifestyle, the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Score (MEDAS) questionnaire was filled out to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet. This questionnaire consists of 14 items, of which each adds 0 or 1 point. The items of this questionnaire positively evaluate the consumption of vegetables, fruit, olive oil, fish, nuts, and negatively the consumption of red meat, sugary drinks, commercial pastries, or butter. It is considered high adherence ≥10 points, which is a strong protector against cardiovascular diseases, medium adherence 8 to 9 points, and poor adherence ≤7 points [43].  PA level and sedentary behavior were analyzed using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) questionnaire [48,49].",ac36e2d4-e3ab-4d80-8eb0-c0ff21c53312
9,methods9," This questionnaire analyzes the daily sitting hours, as well as the level of PA in the categories of work, journey, and leisure time, allowing estimating energy expenditure in weekly METs-min and classifying the subjects into three categories: Category 1: Low/inactive, which means not meeting the criteria of categories 2 or 3. Category 2: Moderate, which means accumulating 600 METs-min per week of moderate-intensity PA spread over 5–7 days per week. Category 3: High, which means accumulating 1500 METs-mins per week of vigorous-intensity PA spread over 3–7 days per week; or 3000 MET-mins per week of moderate to vigorous-intensity PA spread over the 7 days of the week [4].  2.5.2.",4774c51b-6e24-42c7-9843-2bd59d1bafe5
10,methods10," Health-Related Quality of Life  To analyze HrQoL, the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire v2 (SF36) was used, which consists of 36 items scored from 0 (worst perception of HrQoL) to 100 (best perception of HrQoL) in 8 health concepts: Physical Function, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental health [50].  These eight health concepts are regrouped into the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary. A 4-point increase in any of these two components is considered clinically relevant in healthy adults [51].  2.5.3. Anthropometric Variables  Height (cm, Ano Sayol SL height rod, Barcelona, Spain), and weight (kg, Asimed T2 scale, Barcelona, Spain) were measured. Then, the body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) was calculated.  2.6.",5fb3a954-aa51-491d-9c5d-4c3202035d87
11,methods11," Bias  Possible biases in this study could arise from the absence of randomization and a control group so that other external factors beyond the interventions could influence the results. To reduce this risk of bias, the primary analysis of this study was comparing the results obtained by both interventions in lifestyle and HrQoL at T2 to see whether there were significant differences between both cohorts.  2.7. Sample Size  The sample size was calculated using data from a pilot study, where the primary variable was the effect on lifestyle according to the HPLP-II questionnaire, with an alpha error of 0.05 and a beta error of 0.2. Using the G-Power v.3.1 software (Erdfelder et al., Kiel, Germany), the resulting sample needed to achieve the objective of the study was 22 participants, so 24 participants were sampled to compensate for a probable 10% dropout.  2.8.",df23e8c4-108e-4507-9ff8-a2f0093c9052
12,methods12," Statistical Analysis  All the results were analyzed by protocol and intention-to-treat analysis (intention to treat analysis (ITT)). The distribution and normality of the data were analyzed with the Shappiro–Wilk and Levene tests and with P-P and Q-Q plots. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. The independent T test and the Mann–Whitney U-test were used to compare the differences between both groups (remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) and in person supervised exercise group (ISEG)) before the multi-component intervention, with the aim of evaluating the homogeneity of the groups. Then, a paired t-test was performed for both in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) and remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG), to determine the time difference. Finally, to compare the difference between the results of the two interventions, the independent t-test and the Mann–Whitney U-test were used again. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.",2f92182f-60a1-4386-9020-97e8b5bfd3f2
13,methods13," Eta partial squared (η2p) was used as a measure of effect size [52], considering 0.01 a low effect size, 0.06 a moderate effect size, and 0.14 a large effect size [53]. All statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 27.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).  3. Results  3.1. Recruitment  Of 15 participants initially recruited in January 2019, three (20%) did not met the inclusion criteria, so n = 12 subjects were assigned to the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG). Also, of 15 participants initially recruited in January 2020, three (20%) did not met the inclusion criteria, so n = 12 subjects were assigned to the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG). There was one dropout in the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG), and two dropouts in the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG), so the final analysis was performed on 11 remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) and 10 in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) subjects, as is shown in the flow diagram (Figure 2).",7c16db9e-6ca5-49bb-bc73-f579bc54eb66
14,methods14," This study ended six months after completion of the intervention to assess long-term adherence.  3.2. Description of the Sample  In the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG), 42% of the subjects were men and 58% women, while in the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG), 25% were men and 75% were women. The mean age of the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) was 42.78 ± 6.88 years, the bodyweight was 74.98 ± 15.68 kg, and the BMI was 25.82 ± 3.70 kg/m2; while the mean age of the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) was 43.35 ± 7.59 years, the weight was 77.89 ± 13.88 kg, and the BMI was 27.63 ± 4.64 kg/m2. There were no significant differences in these variables between the two groups.  3.3. Lifestyle  In the T1-T2 analysis, the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) participants significantly improved their lifestyle, both in the total score of the HPLP II questionnaire (121.27 ± 12.54, vs. 141.73 ± 17.43; p < 0.001; η2p = 0.",ad29a775-439e-4a27-a38a-a73af14fdb84

The in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) participants also increased significantly their PA levels (28.00 ± 59.78, vs. 1160.00 ± 913.31 metabolic equivalent tasks (METS)-min/week; p < 0.01, η2p = 0.43), progressing from low to moderate levels [4], with a large effect size. Finally, the daily sitting time significantly decreased (612.00 ± 132.06, vs. 537.00 ± 144.53 min; p = 0.03, η2p = 0.44) (Table 1).  When comparing the results in the T1-T2 analysis between the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) and the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG), there were not significant differences in any of the lifestyle variables analyzed (Table 2).  3.4.",f4de5921-8852-444d-b702-8c0ae200bf6d
16,methods19,"  When comparing the results in the T1-T2 analysis between the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) and the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG), there were not significant differences in any of the HrQoL variables analyzed (Table 2).  3.5. Anthropometric Variables  Bodyweight did not change in the T1-T2 analysis in the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) (p = 0.24), but significantly decreased in the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) (77.68 ± 13.26, vs. 73.28 ± 11.17; p < 0.01, η2p = 0.63), with a large effect size (Table 1). There were not significant differences between the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) and in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) (Table 2).  3.6.

17,methods20," Concerning the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG), the mean attendance was 95% for the physical exercise sessions, and 88% for the nutritional workshops. There were no adverse effects caused by the intervention.  4. Discussion  The objective of the present study was to compare adherence to a healthy lifestyle six months after completion of a multi-component intervention with remotely supervised physical exercise in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic versus six months after completion of a multi-component intervention with in-person supervised physical exercise intervention before the COVID-19 pandemic in university employees predisposed to change. Six months after completion of the intervention, both groups obtained increases over time in PA levels, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, diet quality, health-promoting lifestyle, health responsibility, and HrQoL. There were no differences between both groups in any of the variables analyzed.",cfbd6b9a-053b-4fb8-b09b-416a8f405c6b
18,methods21," Compliance was high, around 90%, both in the physical exercise sessions and in the nutritional workshops, in the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) and in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) participants.  Both groups improved PA levels six months after completion of the intervention, qualitatively (HPLP-II questionnaire) and quantitatively (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) questionnaire), with a large effect size, progressing from low PA levels to medium PA levels, with no significant differences between groups. These data contrast with a systematic review conducted in 2016 by Schoeppe et al. [10], in which they reported that virtual interventions were not effective in increasing PA levels. Possibly, the fact that all the participants were predisposed to change and were always supervised by a professional could have influenced the results of the present study [13,14,15].",2fba0ef4-b87d-4963-af65-71cb77d49ad4
19,methods22," On the other hand, both groups increased PA levels in the same way, even though during the COVID-19 pandemic in which the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) participants were, PA levels decreased among the general population [19,20,54].  Regarding sedentary behavior, the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) decreased the daily sitting hours, with a large effect size, while the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) did not. These data are similar to a systematic review carried out in 2017 by Stephenson et al., in which virtual interventions failed to reduce sedentary behavior [11]. However, there were no significant differences between groups, even though during the COVID-19 pandemic in which the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) participants were, sedentary behavior increased among the general population [17,18,19,20,21].",df186876-592f-4528-b569-6d390f6ff120
20,methods23,"  Both groups increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet, with large effect size, and acquired healthy habits such as following a diet low in saturated fat, limiting the consumption of sugars and sweets, eating 2–4 servings of fruit and 3–5 servings of vegetables a day, or limiting the consumption of salt, according to the HPLP-II questionnaire. Participants probably spent less time eating at restaurants and more time cooking at home. Both diet components were similar as they consisted of in-person workshops. The difference between groups was the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in which the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) participants were.",d17c2848-e1aa-4287-992a-e42b21f8569c
21,methods24," The in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) and the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) showed similar improvements, without statistically significant differences, so the context generated by the COVID-19 pandemic was not decisive in these variables to implement this change in habits, even though during this time the prevalence of snacking between meals and the consumption of alcoholic beverages and carbonated beverages have increased [19,54]. Other studies, however, have described that during the COVID-19 pandemic, adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased among the general population [55]. Also, along with our study, other interventions carried out in the workplace have increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet [37,38], increasing the consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and reducing the consumption of cholesterol and saturated fats, although without performing a long-term post-intervention follow-up.",08be6ae1-16dd-4ec1-925c-3a15266e05cf
22,methods25,"  As well as the participants of the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) and the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) improved their PA levels and their eating habits, their HrQoL also increased. In this regard, some observational studies have found positive correlations between HrQoL and PA levels [31] and adherence to the Mediterranean diet [29], while others do not [56]. The remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) participants improved the specific categories of HrQoL of vitality, general health, and physical component summary over time with a large effect size for these three variables, while the in person supervised exercise group (ISEG) improved the general health with a large effect size. No significant differences were found between both interventions, so both groups showed a similar improvement in HrQoL, even though during the COVID-19 pandemic the university community presented very low levels of HrQoL [56].",b90fd413-3158-46ed-8ac0-9e97b36c9f6f
23,methods26,"  The participants in this study achieved long-term adherence to a healthy lifestyle, which could be partly because they were predisposed to change [14], and had psychological support since nutritional barriers and motivation to change were addressed during the workshops [13,15]. Also, before starting the intervention the participants became aware of their unhealthy lifestyle habits and their possible repercussions on the development of NCDs through a detailed report that was given to them [16].  The clinical relevance of the study is that it involves multi-component interventions that promote a healthy lifestyle within the workplace, from the occupational health service, as established by the World Health Organization (WHO) [26], in employees with risk factors for the development of NCDs, such as sedentary behavior and overweight.",686761a7-29d7-4267-ad3c-a1420db2b781
24,methods27," Furthermore, long-term improvement in lifestyle is associated with lower stress levels, better mental health, and higher work productivity [28] Some limitations of this study are that the variables analyzed were self-reported validated surveys and that the population was in a state of predisposition to change, so these results cannot be extrapolated to a population that is not willing to change. The effects achieved in each cohort cannot be attributed to the interventions since the present study was not a randomized controlled trial. On the other hand, the confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary to adapt the physical exercise intervention of the second cohort to virtual supervision.  5. Conclusions  In this study carried out on overweight middle-aged university employees within the workplace, both groups showed similar long-term improvements in their HrQoL and lifestyle, mainly in PA levels and eating habits.",217d2542-23a2-4ecb-a6c5-e5d9f3d0e947
25,methods28," The context of the COVID-19 on which was the remotely supervised exercise group (RSEG) did not seem to have influenced the results. Therefore, remotely supervised physical exercise could be adequate to achieve these objectives in the same way as a conventional face-to-face intervention, at least in a population willing to change.
