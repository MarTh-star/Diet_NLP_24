0,methods0,"2.1. Animals Male albino Wistar rats weighing from 140–280 g were purchased from Animal House of HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry, University of Karachi, Pakistan. The animals were caged separately in plastic cages at room temperature of 22 ± 2°C with free access to tap water and cubes of standard rodent diet during the whole session of experiments. Before starting each experimental session, rats were accustomed to various handling procedures in order to avoid any stress effect and to nullify the psychological affliction of the environment. All the experiments were performed ethically in accordance with the guidelines of the Local Animal Care Ethical Committee.  2.2. Experimental Protocol Rats were divided into two groups: control and test. Control rats received water while to the test group olive oil was given at the dose of 0.25 mL/kg body weight daily for 27 days. On the 28th day, behavioral analysis was performed. Behavioral tests include plus maze activity and forced swim test.",e375f3bf-1623-4beb-aa01-4f5b916ec855
1,methods1," Rats were then decapitated, and their brain was removed within 30 seconds from skull. The membrane covering the brain was removed with the help of fine forceps. The brain then taken out using spatula was dipped in ice-cold saline. All samples were stored at −70°C until neurochemical analysis was done. Frozen brain samples were homogenized in extraction medium using an electrical homogenizer, and neurochemical analysis was performed to estimate concentrations of 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine) and its metabolite 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) and DA (dopamine) and its metabolite HVA (homovalinic acid) in the whole brain of rats by HPLC-EC method as reported by Haider et al. 2004 [22]. A 5 μ Shim-pack ODS separation column of 4.0 mm internal diameter and 150 mm length was used as the stationary phase. Separation was achieved by a mobile phase containing methanol (14%), octyl sodium sulfate (0.023%), and EDTA (0.0035%) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 2.",885d81a8-44e5-4dee-aaf2-857c7995f5cb

Elevated Plus Maze Test (Elevated plus maze (EPM)) Elevated plus maze (Elevated plus maze (EPM)) is an apparatus used to evaluate the rodent's natural behavior which is fear of novel and open areas. The anxiolytic activity of drug in elevated plus maze model was measured according to method as previously reported [23]. Plus maze apparatus consists of four equal size arms. The two opposite arms are open while two were closed. The length of each arm was 50 cm and width is 10 cm. Arms were joined by the central area of 5 cm2. The length of the wall of the closed arm was 40 cm. The maze was elevated from ground at a height of 60 cm. To determine activity, a rat was placed in the center of the plus maze and the time spent in the open arm was monitored for 5 minutes.   2.3.2.",3595862c-64ed-4057-91d8-ebd05e93ea4d
3,methods3," Forced Swimming Test Assessment of depressive symptoms was monitored by forced swim test (forced swim test (FST)) following 4 weeks of oral administration of drug. forced swim test (FST) was performed as described by Detke et al. [24]. To monitor the antidepressant activity, rats are placed individually in a tank (53, 19, 28 cm). The water is filled up to 18 cm. The height of the water is such that animal is supposed to swim. The animal is subjected in the container for 5 minutes, and behavioral scoring was performed by noting immobility time. After each test, rats were dried with towel and placed in home cage.   2.4. Statistical Analysis The data was analyzed by Student's t-test. Values are represented as mean ± SD, and values of P < 0.05 are considered as significant.  3. Results  Figure 1 shows the effect of repeated administration of olive oil on depression like symptoms in animals.

4,methods4,05) increase in struggling time following repeated administration of extravirgin olive oil indicating that olive oil has significant antidepressant effects.   Figure 2 shows the effect of olive on anxiety in animals. Analysis by Student's t-test revealed that there was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in time spent in open arm following repeated administration of extra-virgin olive oil. This indicates that administration of olive oil produces anxiolytic effects in animals.    Table 1 shows the effect of olive oil on levels of brain 5-HT and its metabolite 5-HIAA. Student's t-test analysis showed a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels following repeated administration of extra-virgin olive oil which indicates a decrease in 5-HT metabolism and synthesis.    Table 2 shows the effect of repeated administration of olive oil on levels of brain DA and its metabolite HVA. Analysis by Student's t-test revealed that there was a significant (P < 0.,c8461055-f854-4a57-b2a8-55e415580014
5,methods5,"05) decrease in brain DA levels while the HVA levels were significantly (P < 0.01) increased following repeated administration of extra-virgin olive oil which indicates that olive oil administration led to an enhancement in HVA levels and a decrease in brain DA by increasing DA metabolism.  4. Discussion Olive oil is used throughout the world mostly in the mediterranean because of its beneficial health effects. In the last few years, the number of reports describing the beneficial properties of olive has been increasing. Recent data has suggested that component of olive oil may have more health benefits than previously thought. The present study reveals that repeated administration of extra-virgin olive oil produces anxiolytic and antidepressant effects via neurochemical alterations in brain 5-HT, DA, and their metabolites.   Role of omega-3 fatty acid in adaptation to stress has been documented previously [13].",1da27af7-90f4-4a63-96f5-0fb786268d7e
6,methods6," Reports have shown that low levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are involved in producing depression as omega-3 fatty acids are important component of nerve cell membrane and help nerve cells to communicate with each other, which is an essential step in maintaining good mental health. Omega-3 fatty acid of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) group has been shown to decrease or prevent aggression during examination [25]. High levels of omega-3 fatty acid in serum have been shown to lower the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines thus protecting from stress [26]. In the present study, it is has been observed that repeated administration of extra-virgin olive oil produce significant antidepressant effects as the struggling time of rats taking olive oil was significantly increased as compared to control rats. This indicates that olive oil has great potential to reduce depression which may be due to presence of linoleic acid; a polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid that makes up 1.",6d3839d8-c143-4b99-afca-fd847ee47ec2
7,methods7,5% of extra-virgin olive oil [27].  Studies on animal model showed an association of depressive behavior with altered DA function [28]. Evidence from animal and human studies showed that DA and NA play important role in pathophysiology as well as in therapeutic effect of antidepressants [29]. Evidence from clinical studies supports the finding that depressed patients have reduced CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) levels of HVA [30]. Decreased DA and increased levels of HVA are an indication of increased release of DA and increased turnover which may play important role in antidepressant effect of DA [31]. Decreased DA and increased HVA levels together with the increased struggling time following repeated administration of extra-virgin olive oil observed in the present study support the findings that olive oil produces antidepressive effect by increasing the release and turnover of DA.,39e50767-5c73-4ab5-af1a-f412f65f770c
8,methods8,"  The present findings also revealed that the anxiolytic property of extra-virgin olive oil as time spent in open arms in Elevated plus maze (EPM) was increased significantly following repeated administration of extra-virgin olive oil. The anxiolytic effect of extra-virgin olive oil could be due to presence of phenolic antioxidants, olieic acid, tocopherols, and oleuropin in olive oil. It has been reported that phenolic antioxidants produce anxiolytic effect [18]. Anxiolytic effects of olive oil observed in the present study may be due to alterations in brain 5-HT metabolism. Role of 5-HT in anxiety is well documented. Increased 5-HT produces anxiogenic effect while decreased level of 5-HT produces anxiolytic effect [19]. In the present study, it has been found that extra-virgin olive oil decreases brain 5-HT as well as 5-HIAA levels in rat brain.",4b35714e-8a60-40b2-941c-e0708abc1544
9,methods9," Administration of extra-virgin olive oils ignificantly decreases 5-HT synthesis and metabolism that may play important role in reducing anxiety in animals. Decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels together with the increased time spent in open arm in Elevated plus maze (EPM) observed in present study indicate that extra-virgin olive oil produces anxiolytic effect by decreasing 5-HT metabolism.  5. Conclusion Olive oil is an essential ingredient of Mediterranean food. Olive oil has important effect on body and has protective effect against several pathological conditions. Results of present study show that olive oil produces anxiolytic effect via decreasing brain 5-HT synthesis and metabolism. However, antidepressive effect of olive oil may attribute to the increased DA release and its metabolism. Results of the present study supported the use of olive oil as food supplementation for mood elevation.
