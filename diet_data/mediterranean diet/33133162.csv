Study Participants  Asymptomatic adults with hypercholesterolemia who voluntarily visited the Family Medicine Clinic at Gangnam Severance Hospital, South Korea, were recruited into a protocol approved by the institutional review board and gave written informed consent. Volunteers were eligible if they had at least one of the following criteria: total cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dL, LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL, or TG ≥ 200 mg/dL. Exclusion criteria included a history of cardiovascular disease or stroke, current cancer treatment, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >120 mmHg), uncontrolled diabetes or fasting glucose ≥ 200 mg/mL, hepatic disease (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] or alanine aminotransferase [ALT] > 3× institutional upper limit of normal) or renal disease (serum creatinine > 2.",72ad8808-61ba-49b1-860b-25768a287804

Among 100 participants assessed for eligibility, one patient with triglycerides of 1200 was excluded for starting lipid-lowering medication after an interview with the physician before randomization. Patients consenting to participate in the study were randomized into two groups. Patients in group 1 performed the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) intervention first, followed by the control diet, and group 2 followed the conventional diet first and then the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) intervention. After the phase 1 intervention, two patients (one lost to follow-up, one became pregnant) from group 1 and one patient (withdrew consent) from group 2 were excluded.",e13cb036-f239-40c0-95a8-50c8a868d365
2,methods2," After the phase 2 intervention, two patients from each group were excluded due to withdrawal. A total of 92 patients completed the full 10-week trial (Figure 1).  2.2. Study Design  This study was a single-center, randomized, crossover, open-label study conducted at Gangnam Severance Hospital, South Korea, from April 2020 to May 2021. Randomization was based on a random-number table prepared by a biostatistician. After randomization, study participants and researchers who administered the interventions were not blinded, but researchers who assessed outcomes were blinded. Participants were randomized to the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) or a control diet for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week washout period and a second 4-week crossover phase (Figure 1).  The study design and experimental protocol were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gangnam Severance Hospital (IRB number 3-2020-0049) under the Declaration of Helsinki.",27870058-35af-4204-943e-6bde2195af2b
3,methods3," Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before screening and data collection. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number: NCT04486664).  2.3. Dietary Interventions  The participants allocated to the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) received home delivery of two meals (lunch and dinner) daily except for weekends during the 4-week intervention period and were directed to eat no fewer than seven meals every week. The meals were prepared by chefs trained on the principles of the MD, under the supervision of professional nutritionists. In addition, the nutritionist provided dietary advice and a leaflet to ensure adherence to the MD pattern for the remainder of the week’s meals not provided with the convenience meal package. Women were instructed to eat salad for breakfast, two MD pattern meals, along with nuts, low-fat milk, and fruits for snacks; men were instructed to eat regular breakfast, two MD pattern meals, and the same snacks as women.",308b7700-a53a-42ef-affd-831f3af01315
4,methods4," The nutritionist assessed compliance and provided feedback during the weekend using the mobile application Kini care. Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) packages were made according to the core concept of the MD and consisted of a carbohydrate: protein: fat ratio of 5:2:3 and had an omega-6 to omega-3 fat ratio of less than 4 to 8 in consideration of Korean dietary habits. In addition, the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) packages include fewer grains and higher proportions of fish, seafood, and tofu than traditional Korean diets. Two Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) packages per day include 15 g of olive oil (3 servings), 1.5 servings of fruit, 4 servings of vegetables, 1 serving of nuts, and 3.5 servings of fish and meat. Red wine was not included in this analysis. The types of food were substituted by matching the foods using a Korean food exchange list that is similar to the food group classified in the Mediterranean diet pyramid.",8146f739-b513-4c64-b1fe-04f8cd435d28
5,methods5," Examples of the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) package are presented in Figure A1. The composition of macronutrients was established based on the result of calculating the macronutrient ratio associated with the lowest all-cause mortality from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES)) linked with causes of death data by our research team [10].  During the control period, participants were advised to consume a conventional diet consisting of 55–65% carbohydrate, 7–20% protein, and 15–30% fat, with 4–10% from omega-6 fat and 1% from omega-3 fat, and no more than 300 mg cholesterol per day, based on the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for Koreans 2015. Participants received only dietary training without meal delivery during the control period. Total caloric intake was restricted to 1500 kcal for men and 1300 kcal for women in both the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) and control diet periods.",f19ca023-cd93-45e1-8008-1f8825277b78
6,methods6," The same nutritionist gave dietary advice to participants in both groups and all participants had continuous access to the nutritionist for advice and consultation throughout the study. During the 2-week washout period, subjects were instructed to consume their usual diet before the clinical trial. Nutritionists assessed compliance using the mobile application Kini Care, which was developed for nutrition management of patients with metabolic diseases and cancer [11]. This smart phone-based application provides nutritional analysis and calorie analysis based on the Korean food intake and analysis system (K-FIAS), a raw material analysis system. During both the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) and control diet periods, we recommended that participants do moderate-intensity aerobic activity for 150 min every week.  2.4. Measurements and Endpoints  Anthropometric measurements were taken by one qualified provider while the participants were barefoot and wearing light clothes.",4ba61300-e910-4921-aad2-fc65879c7694
7,methods7," Body weight (nearest 0.1 kg) was measured along with height (nearest 0.1 cm) using an automatic extensometer (BSM 330; Biospace, Seoul, South Korea). Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m2). Body composition, including skeletal muscle mass, fat mass, and fat percentage, was assessed using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer (ACCUNIQ BC720; SELVAS Healthcare Inc., Daejeon, South Korea). Waist circumference was measured at the horizontal plane midway between the lowest ribs and the iliac crest with the participant in a standing position.  Fasting blood samples were collected from an antecubital vein at baseline and at the end of each diet period (Figure 2). White blood cell (white blood cell (WBC)) counts were quantified with an XN-9000 hematology analyzer (Sysmex, Lincolnshire, IL, USA).",8fb9dc5d-929f-4bc4-981e-95a7908141f1
8,methods8," Fasting glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels were measured with the ADVIA 1650 Clinical Chemistry system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Tarrytown, NY, USA). Apolipoproteins Al and B were estimated using the Cobas c702 chemistry autoanalyser (Hitachi Co., Tokyo, Japan). Fasting insulin was measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using an Elecsys 2010 instrument (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) method by applying the following formula: HOMA-IR = fasting insulin (μIU/mL) × fasting glucose (mg/dL)/405. fatty liver index (FLI) was calculated by the following formula [12]:fatty liver index (FLI) = (e0.953 × loge(triglycerides) + 0.139 × Body mass index (BMI) + 0.718 × loge(GGT) + 0.053 × waist circumference − 15.745)/(1 + e0.953 × loge(triglycerides) + 0.139 × Body mass index (BMI) + 0.",c4087972-61d4-4870-91c3-11c5763fa321

At baseline and at the end of each diet period, health-related (e.g., physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption) and food intake questionnaires were administered. The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire was used to calculate the quantity of physical activity in metabolic equivalent hours per week. The 24-h dietary recall method was used to calculate the intake of total calories and specific nutrients for one day. The degree of adherence to the MD was assessed using the Korean version of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (K-MEDAS), which was developed by our research group [13].  Safety assessments included evaluations of treatment-emergent adverse events, concomitant medications, vital signs (recorded at each visit), and clinical laboratory measures (recorded at baseline and the end of each diet), including serum creatinine and liver function tests.",7bb7aa11-630d-4769-a3e3-9a198acc3617
10,methods10,"  The primary efficacy endpoint was a change in serum lipid levels. Secondary endpoints were changes in weight, Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, white blood cell (WBC) count, hs-CRP, glycemic variables (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR), and fatty liver index (FLI).  2.5. Statistical Analysis  All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and SPSS for windows (version 23.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Differences in nutrition components between two groups were analyzed using an independent t-test if the data were normally distributed and a Mann–Whitney U test if not. The fixed effects of MD, period, and sequence were compared using a linear mixed model after adjusting for age, sex, total energy intake changes, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and physical activity variance. The variables with carry-over effect were analyzed using the paired t-test after period 1. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",5f745ff9-7be5-428e-b759-f148bced707e
11,methods11,"  The sample size was calculated according to our primary endpoints. Differences in total cholesterol between a rural diet (MD) and an urban diet were selected as minimum clinically significant values [14]. The sample size was calculated using a two-sided t-test with 90% power, a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided), and a dropout rate of 25%.  3. Results  We recruited 100 eligible subjects, and 92 subjects completed the full trial (Figure 1). The clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. Participants who received the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) showed significantly lower total energy intake, lower intake of trans fat and cholesterol, higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and higher K-MEDAS scores compared with the control diet group (Table 2).",263e5998-99b5-476c-b008-0e3fd37cc086
12,methods12," There was no significant difference between the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) and control diets in the absolute amount of fiber; however, the fiber content per 1000 kcal was higher in the MD group (10.2 g/1000 kcal) than that in the control diet (7.7 g/1000 kcal).  The Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) consisted of a 5:3:2 carbohydrates: fat: protein ratio, whereas the control diet showed a higher proportion of carbohydrates (55.8%) (Figure 3). K-MEDAS was significantly higher in the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) group than in the control group.  After Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) intervention, total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C significantly decreased compared to the control diet even after adjusting for age, sex, total energy intake changes, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and changes in physical activity (Table A1).",80ca0bfb-76b9-43ef-b68f-668a6242ef3f
13,methods13," Weight and Body mass index (BMI) were decreased in the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) group compared to the control group after adjusting for confounding variables. Cardiometabolic parameters, including white blood cell (WBC) count, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and fatty liver index (FLI), also significantly decreased after the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) period compared to the control diet after adjustment. The actual values of each parameter are reported in Table A2.  The sequence in which participants consumed each diet did not affect the mean changes in weight, Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and metabolic factors, except for mean change in fatty liver index (FLI). A significant period effect was shown in the mean changes of total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C. Therefore, we analyzed these three metabolic parameters only after period 1 (Table A3) and saw a significant decrease in total cholesterol and LDL-C after MD period 1.",8a7c2e1f-46bf-4c7a-9183-86b4eae50104
14,methods14," However, since the amount of change per variable was tremendous, these variations require detailed interpretation and therefore calls for further research. We plan to explore these variables by increasing the study population and subdividing it into groups that can secure more homogeneity. Figure 4 shows that body weight, Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and all metabolic parameters significantly decreased in the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) group in both periods. Furthermore, when we adjusted for weight reduction and added previous confounders, white blood cell (WBC), fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and fatty liver index (FLI) were still significantly decreased in the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) group compared with the control group (Table A4). These results suggest that the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) improves metabolic parameters beyond the improvement seen with weight reduction.",7b78090f-b80e-470e-adc2-1c4cf46985e3
15,methods15," Adverse events were not detected during the full clinical trial. Safety was measured using vital signs and clinical laboratory measures (serum creatinine and liver function tests).  4. Discussion  In this randomized controlled crossover trial, we found that Body mass index (BMI), lipid profile, glycemic index, white blood cell (WBC) count, and fatty liver index (FLI) decreased after 4 weeks on the calorie-restricted Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD). Further, after adjusting for weight reduction, white blood cell (WBC), fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and fatty liver index (FLI) still showed statistically significant reductions, so the effect of the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) is not solely due to weight reduction.  Our study results are consistent with the findings of previous studies examining the beneficial effects of an MD on various cardiometabolic diseases [15,16,17,18].",e9d1ee5f-1089-46c0-abd0-c9874c638c89
16,methods16," A randomized trial comparing the short-term effects of an MD versus a low-fat diet reported that a MD with virgin olive oil or mixed nuts resulted in lower blood pressure, improved lipid profile level, decreased insulin resistance, and reduced inflammatory markers compared with a low-fat diet [19]. Esposito et al. reported that an MD improved glycemic control and delayed the need for anti-hyperglycemic drug therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [20]. Several studies have reported that the MD or the frequent consumption of olive oil, nuts, or red wine has anti-inflammatory effects [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. A long-term clinical study suggested that MDs and low-carbohydrate diets improved cardiometabolic parameters by reducing hepatic fat content and showed beneficial effects on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) [29,30].",bcc688a1-502a-48b7-867a-3e7353337176
17,methods17," On the other hand, the decrease in HDL-C after MD is the opposite result to that reported in previous studies; however, it seems to be the effect of calorie restriction. Several previous studies have shown that HDL-C levels are reduced after calorie restriction intervention [31,32]. Nevertheless, since LDL-C is the criterion for initiating medication in patients with dyslipidemia, the result of this study showing significant reductions in LDL-C through Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) is clinically important in terms of delaying the initiation of medication in patients.  However, most of the previous studies investigated adherence to the conceptual guidelines of a MD or provided only the primary components of the MD, such as extra virgin olive oil and nuts, and there were few studies providing Mediterranean style prepared meal packages. Even more, it is not well known whether a MD is useful for East Asians as well as western populations.",e40a2678-c9fd-47e3-a62c-054711006f19
18,methods18," In our study, hypercholesterolemic patients were provided with convenience meals adhering to the core concepts of the MD with the ideal ratio of macronutrients that could lower the mortality rate of Koreans and improve several cardiometabolic parameters.  The exact mechanisms explaining the favorable effects of adhering to the MD have not been fully elucidated. However, several plausible pathways have been elucidated. Fatty acid composition of a MD is characterized by low cholesterol and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and high MUFA and PUFA contents [33]. High intake of SFAs increases LDL-C by inhibiting LDL receptor activity and stimulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein production [34]. However, when SFAs are partially replaced with PUFAs or MUFAs, total and LDL-C levels decrease [35]. The high intake of phytosterols and water-soluble fibers from nuts, seeds, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits may also play a significant role in lowering plasma cholesterol levels.",848df904-4afb-4743-ac9a-a49dab377cb5
19,methods19," Phytosterols compete with intestinal cholesterol absorption [36] and water-soluble fibers increase the rate of bile excretion, therefore, reducing serum total and LDL-C [37]. In our study, after Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) intervention, mean total cholesterol and LDL-C were decreased by approximately 16 mg/dL and 8 mg/dL, respectively. However, in contrast to the previous study, HDL-C also decreased after Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) intervention. We assume that the effect of weight reduction after dietary intervention led to conflicting results in the HDL-C level. After adjusting for weight reduction, the group difference in mean HDL-C between the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) and control diet groups disappeared.  Low-grade inflammation is implicated in the development of chronic metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [38].",fd263c5b-a50c-4969-84ec-786ad8111ac9
20,methods20," The clinical benefits of the MD are suggested to be mostly from the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities of various component nutrients [39]. A meta-analysis, including 17 randomized controlled trials, provided evidence that the MD decreases the levels of inflammatory markers such as CRP, interleukin-6, and adhesion molecules [40]. In line with this, we observed that the white blood cell (WBC) count significantly decreased and CRP levels decreased marginally after the Korean style Mediterranean diet (KMD) intervention.  Current evidence indicates that intake of a high omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is associated with a pro-inflammatory response and promotes the development of many chronic diseases [41]. Although the optimal level varies with the disease under consideration, the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) recommends an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 5/8, which should form 1–2% of total energy intake per day [42].",68f75a15-847b-4381-83f3-1fe53d2706e5
21,methods21," In this context, we provided Korean style Mediterranean meal packages with omega-6 to 3 ratios of less than 4/8 in consideration of Korean dietary habits and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.  The MD has desirable attributes for glycemic control and reducing hepatic fat accumulation, including low-glycemic–index carbohydrates, moderate-to-high content of vegetables, and a moderate fat content [43]. Low-glycemic–index meals improve postprandial glycemia, possibly by reducing non-esterified fatty acid concentrations [44] and hepatic triacylglycerols [45]. Omega-3 PUFA regulates hepatic gene expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), and omega-9 fatty acids exert important effects in regulating gene expression related to insulin sensitivity [46] as well as lipid and glucose metabolism [47]. In addition, dietary antioxidant intake leads to modulation of insulin resistance and inflammatory cytokine generation [48].",4133250b-cb1d-4801-90bd-ced9772fdd08
22,methods22," Our results further support the beneficial effects of a MD with favorable changes in fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and fatty liver index (FLI).  The present study has several limitations. First, the duration of the intervention (4 weeks) was relatively short. Second, the sample size was small compared to previous studies. Thus, further large-scale and long-term investigations are required to evaluate the possible consequences on metabolic parameters. Third, the study was performed in subjects with hypercholesterolemia; therefore, the results may not be generalizable to the overall population. Fourth, since blood samples were not collected after the 2-week washout period, baseline values could differ from those at visit 2. To minimize this limitation, we analyzed sequence and period p-values.",8a3b8126-c76f-47d2-a638-0ed617f1509c
23,methods23," In addition, we applied calorie restriction along with MD; as such, it is difficult to conclude that MD alone contributed to the results of this study, even after adjusting for calorie intake changes. Finally, whether the clinical effects of the MD are due to the overall dietary pattern or are the sum of effects of individual nutritional components has been controversial. Therefore, additional large-scale, long-term cohort studies or experimental studies are needed to clarify the exact physiological mechanism of the MD.  However, despite these limitations, the present study has several strengths, including an adequately powered sample size and its design as a randomized controlled crossover trial.",0fd818f5-a9fa-4f02-90ef-885c229e1e34
24,methods24," Moreover, whereas most MD randomized controlled trials evaluated MD adherence based on a self-reporting questionnaire, we provided the same MD style meals to all participants, and nutritionists monitored daily food intake and assessed compliance using a mobile application during the intervention period to minimize recall bias. Finally, this study achieved high compliance rates of more than 90%.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, the results of our study suggest that the calorie-restricted MD not only helps to treat dyslipidemia by improving the lipid profile in hypercholesterolemia patients but also has beneficial effects on reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by improving chronic inflammation, hyperglycemia, and fatty liver disease independently of individual energy intake, physical activity, and weight reduction changes.
