0,background0,"Obesity is a major determinant of type 2 diabetes. Over the last decade, multiple genome wide association studies (GWAs) have identified numerous polymorphisms associated with body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), and some of them have also been related to higher type 2 diabetes risk [1-7]. However, how the majority of these genes function in affecting anthropometric-related parameters is unknown. Moreover, both obesity and type 2 diabetes have been associated with higher blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk [8,9]. Currently, to better understand the possible mechanisms involved, some studies have also analyzed the association between these obesity-related genes with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, metabolic syndrome, etc. [10-13]. The FAIM2 (Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2) is one of the less well-known genes associated with obesity.",b799d7ad-b51d-43b0-9a40-3ae8a4d95ab1
1,background1," The rs7138803 (G > A) single nucleotide polymorphism (single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)) located near the FAIM2 locus was described for the first time to be associated with higher body mass index (BMI) in carriers of the minor allele by Thorleifsson et al. [4]. Later, Speliotes et al. [6] in a larger GWAs confirmed this association and estimated that the increase of body mass index (BMI) per variant allele would be ~ 0.12 kg/m2. However, the results of later studies in different populations have been diverse [14-20], suggesting some heterogeneity of the association depending on the characteristics of the population analyzed. FAIM2, also called NMP35 (neural membrane protein 35), or LFG (lifeguard), is known to codify for an antiapoptotic protein, highly expressed in the brain that antagonizes the Fas pathway [21,22]. Fas (CD95 or APO-1) is a cell surface receptor, expressed in a variety of tissues.",87ef2b18-f0c8-45c6-bcc1-845400702865
2,background2," FasL is a member of the tumour necrosis factor superfamily and the natural ligand to Fas [23]. Various studies have associated both Fas and FasL concentrations with hypertension and cardiovascular risk [24,25], and there is a study in Chinese subjects showing an association between the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism and diastolic blood pressure [26]. However, there are no published studies in humans that have analyzed the association between the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism and resting heart rate, which is an independent and important risk factor of cardiovascular diseases [27-29], mainly in type 2 diabetic patients [30]. Although, in animal models, it has been shown that Faim2 is a novel neuroprotective molecule in the context of cerebral ischemia [31], there are no studies on humans that have analyzed the association between FAIM2 polymorphisms and cerebrovascular disease risk.",7a711628-e911-4331-931e-5a2ee1673ce7
3,background3," Only one previous study, carried out in a Chinese population [32], has examined the association between the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism and cardiovascular disease, but no statistical association was found. Taking into account that the Fas apoptotic pathway has been implicated in type 2 diabetes and that a high glucose intake can induce vascular endothelial cell apoptosis and higher risk of myocardial infarction [33,34], we hypothesized that the association between the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism and heart rate and cardiovascular disease would be greater in type 2 diabetic subjects. Additionally, diet may modulate this association, as one experimental study showing that nutritional state affects the expression of the Faim2 gene suggested [35].",ead25beb-3c1a-4966-b31f-49c25d5c977c
4,background4," Thus, our aims were: 1) To analyze the association of the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism with anthropometrical measures, blood pressure and resting heart rate in the whole population and in type 2 diabetic subjects at baseline, also analyzing its modulation by adherence to the MedDiet; 2) To study the longitudinal association of the polymorphism with heart rate and with incidence of cardiovascular diseases (stroke and myocardial infarction) by diabetes status, also analyzing modulation by intervention with MedDiet.

5,methods0,"Subjects We analyzed 7,161 participants (3,049 men and 4,112 women) in the PREDIMED (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) trial from whom the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism was successfully determined. The PREDIMED study is a multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial (controlled-trials.com number, ISRCTN35739639) aimed at assessing the effects of the MedDiet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [36]. The completion date of this study was December 2010 and the total number of randomized subjects was 7,447. The 7,161 participants included in the present study did not differ in the main characteristics from those of the total cohort. Additional file 1: Figure S1 shows the CONSORT flowchart of the trial. Details of the PREDIMED trial including sample size calculations and interim analysis have been fully described elsewhere [36-38]. Briefly, from October 2003 physicians in Primary Care Centers selected high cardiovascular risk subjects.",bebdefa8-8825-4d8f-bcf9-a90e6025a9b5
6,methods1," Eligible subjects were community-dwelling people (55–80 years of age for men; 60–80 years of age for women) who fulfilled at least one of two criteria: type 2 diabetes [39] or three or more cardiovascular risk factors as previously detailed [36-38]. Exclusion criteria included a personal history of cardiovascular disease, any severe chronic illness, and drug or alcohol addiction [36]. Participants were randomly assigned to three interventions: MedDiet with extra-virgin olive oil, MedDiet with mixed nuts and control group (low-fat diet). Participants assigned to both MedDiet groups received intensive training to follow the MedDiet and allocations of either extra virgin olive oil (1 litre/week, for all the family) or mixed nuts (30 g/d) at no cost [36,37]. Participants assigned to the control diet received recommendations on reducing the intake of all types of fat. A detailed description of the nutritional interventions has been provided elsewhere [36].",2896cf98-2c75-484f-8959-dd45d8c0bd85
7,methods2," The Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of each participating center approved the study protocol. All participants provided written informed consent. Participants were followed up for a median of 4.8 years (interquartile range, 2.8 to 5.8 years). Data were analyzed cross-sectionally (at baseline) as well as longitudinally (pooling together the MedDiet intervention groups versus the control group). By December 2010, a total of 502 participants (7.0%) had been lost to follow-up for 2 or more years. Dropout rates were higher in the control group (11%) than in the MedDiet groups (5%) (Additional file 1: Figure S1). As compared with participants who remained in the trial, those who dropped out were younger (by 1.4 years), had a higher body mass index (BMI) and a lower score for the adherence to the MedDiet as previously detailed elsewhere [36].",cca395ef-c7f2-4608-83d8-e4d828f242d4
8,methods3," The effect of the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism on heart rate was also examined longitudinally analyzing all subjects having heart rate data at baseline, at 1-year, at 3-years and at 5-years (n = 2,310). The reduction in the number of cases in the longitudinal analysis was mainly due no to patients being lost during follow up, but to the fact that patients were not all recruited in the same year at the beginning of the study, but progressively over the following years (from 2003 to 2009) as previously described [36]. Therefore, individuals who entered the study in 2003 completed the 5-year follow-up period in the year 2010, which is when follow-up ended, whereas those who entered the study in later years could not complete the 5-year follow-up period and so were not included in the longitudinal analyses of the study on heart rate. The Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of each participating center approved the study protocol. All participants provided written informed consent.",44706801-8d17-4eac-b19a-b0392e964762
9,methods4,"  Demographic, clinical, anthropometric and dietary measurements The baseline examination included an assessment of standard cardiovascular risk factors, medication use, socio-demographic factors and lifestyle variables, as previously detailed [36,38]. Food consumption was determined by a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire [40]. Adherence to MedDiet at baseline was assessed by a validated 14-item questionnaire [41]. The final score ranged from 0 to 14. The greater the score obtained from the questionnaire, the greater the adherence to the MedDiet. Physical activity was estimated by the Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, as previously described [36].  Weight and height were measured with calibrated scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer, respectively. body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.",5cd1415d-d9bf-4bdb-b59d-2018f35832dc
10,methods5,"  At baseline and yearly thereafter, trained personnel measured blood pressure and heart rate in triplicate using a validated semiautomatic oscillometer (Omron HEM-705CP, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands) with a 5-minute interval between each measurement with the patients seated and at rest in a peaceful setting. The means of these measurements were calculated.  Outcome ascertainment The primary endpoint was the occurrence of the first major cardiovascular events and comprised myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death [36]. We used four sources of information to identify end-points: 1) repeated contacts with participants; 2) family physicians; 3) yearly review of medical records; and 4) consultation of the National Death Index. The end-point adjudication committee, whose members were blind to treatment allocation, examined all medical records related to end-points.",07b4da68-da4a-4f21-a07d-7ee483326b86
11,methods6," Only end-points confirmed by the adjudication committee that occurred between October 1, 2003, and December 1, 2010 were included in the analyses. The criteria for adjudicating primary outcomes are detailed elsewhere [36].  Biochemical determinations, DNA extraction and genotyping At baseline, blood samples were obtained from each participant after an overnight fast and were frozen at -80°C. Fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C and LDL-C were measured using standard methods as previously described [37].  Genomic DNA was extracted from buffy-coat with the MagNaPure LC DNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The rs7138803 (G > A) polymorphism near FAIM2 was genotyped on a 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, FosterCity, CA, USA) using a fluorescent allelic discrimination TaqMan™ assay. The calling rate was 98%. Genotype frequencies did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations (P = 0.378).",ccf16b0e-7d06-4abb-a2e4-df7c1b62e978
12,methods7,"  Statistical analyses Data were analyzed both at baseline and longitudinally in the intervention trial. Chi-square tests were used to test differences in percentages. T and ANOVA tests were applied to compare crude means of continuous variables among genotypes at baseline. Multivariable adjustments for continuous variables were carried out by linear regression analysis and regression coefficients (B) were estimated. Models were sequentially adjusted for age, sex, center, type 2 diabetes, total energy intake, adherence to MedDiet, alcohol, tobacco, physical activity, hypertension, and medications (antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and hypoglycemic drugs) as indicated. Antihypertensive medication included angiotensin-converting enzymes (angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE)) inhibitors (48% of the population took these), diuretics (21% of the population) and other antihypertensive drugs (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, etc.) regardless of the dosage, as previously described [36].",968d6b46-a71a-4fb0-aff7-b1a12467ce34
13,methods8," Three dummy variables (taking or not taking the corresponding drug regardless of the dosage) were considered for the antihypertensive medication including angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs. In addition a dummy variable (taking or not taking) for lipid-lowering drugs and two dummy variables (one for insulin and other for oral antidiabetic agents) were included in the adjustment for medications. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure > =140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > =90 mmHg or under antihypertensive medication. The FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism was first tested as additive for continuous traits analyzed. However, when the differences between heterozygous and homozygous subjects for the variant A-allele were very small, a recessive model was selected (for heart rate). A dichotomous variable for the pre-randomization adherence to MedDiet was created using the sample means as cut-off values (9 points).",6c655005-38fd-4365-bed3-03bd9368046f
14,methods9," Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) > = 30 kg/m2. Logistic regression methods were also used to estimate the contribution of the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism to predict obesity. In addition, body mass index (BMI) was categorized into four categories (body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2; 25–30 kg/m2; 30–35 kg/m2 and > =35 kg/m2). Heart rate in beats per minute (bmp) was also categorized into five categories (<=60, 60–70, 70–80, 80–90 and > =90 bmp) for categorical analyses. The interaction between the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism and adherence to the MedDiet in determining body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and resting heart rate at baseline was tested in multivariable regression models (linear or logistic for categorical) including the corresponding main effects and interaction terms. Subgroup analyses stratified by type 2 diabetes status were carried out according to our “a priori” hypothesis and aim.",5894a125-9f22-4535-a04d-6ccae63833d0
15,methods10," The effect of the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism on heart rate in the whole population and stratified by type 2 diabetes status was also examined longitudinally analyzing all subjects having heart rate data at baseline, at 1-year, at 3-years and at 5-years (n = 2,310) in a multivariable model of repeated measures with interactions terms after adjustment for the dietary intervention and the indicated covariates. Dietary intervention was considered as a dichotomous variable pooling together the MedDiet intervention groups versus the control group after having checked the homogeneity of the effect in the two MedDiet groups). In addition, we analyzed the interaction term between the FAIM2-rs7138803 and dietary intervention on changes in heart rate at 5-years by linear regression analysis with multivariable adjustment.",dfc09d8a-45ea-4270-8148-5e6f7e6581bb
16,methods11," Finally, we examined the association between the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism and cardiovascular events (total cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction or stroke) in the whole population and in type 2 diabetic subjects by Cox regression models with the length of follow-up as the primary time variable and adjustment for the dietary intervention and the other covariates as indicated. The exposure time was calculated as the time between randomization and the date of a major cardiovascular event, the date when completing the last interview, December 1st 2010, or the date at death, whichever came first. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism (recessive model) for cardiovascular diseases were calculated in the population as a whole. In addition, we carried out the stratified analysis by type-2 diabetes status. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle.",dc97d969-9e09-45a7-a211-28aa9727f9ee
17,methods12," In multivariable model 1 we adjusted for sex, age, center and dietary intervention. Multivariable model 2 included additional adjustments for body mass index (BMI), total energy intake, alcohol, smoking, type-2 diabetes, medications and physical activity. Additional adjustments for baseline hypertension were also undertaken. The proportionality of hazards in determining the main outcomes in the PREDIMED study was tested with the use of time-varying covariates as previously described [36]. Here we graphically checked the assumption of proportional hazards for the genetic factor (FAIM2) by looking at the Log-Log plot of survival. We obtained parallel lines for the curves of genotypes in all the models fitted. Finally, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to estimate the probability of remaining free of myocardial infarction during follow-up. Statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS package, version 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).",f85d27ed-5397-4831-a324-2747842652e2
18,methods13," All tests were two-tailed and the nominal significance level was set at a P-value <0.05. In addition, the Bonferroni correction was applied to compensate for multiple comparisons. Our approach consisted of using an adjusted alpha level equal to the nominal alpha level (0.05), divided by the number of new hypothesis tested. With the aim of achieving a balance between type I and type II errors, we have chosen to undertake the Bonferroni correction considering the three new groups of variables that we were investigating (heart rate, blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases). Anthropometric measures were not included in the correction because in this case we were not dealing with a new hypothesis of association. Thus, the adjusted alpha was 0.05/3 = 0.017. The significance of each original (uncorrected) test was assessed at this level. Thus, a P-value <0.017 was considered to be statistically significant taking into account the correction for multiple comparisons. ",870bd6ba-30ae-4942-be8c-1b5fc13dbcbc

Thus, in the case of myocardial infarction, a similar trend to a greater risk was observed in AA subjects compared with G-carriers both in the control group (HR: 1.66, 95% CI: 0.70-3.81) as in the MedDiet intervention groups (HR: 1.59; 95% CI: 0.85-2.99).

32,discussion0,"In this study on high cardiovascular risk subjects (48% patients with type 2 diabetes) from a Mediterranean population, we found, as in other studies [4,6,8,18,20,42], that the variant allele of the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism was associated with higher obesity risk. Furthermore, our results support the observations of Paternoster et al. [7] and Sandholt et al. [20] who found that this polymorphism was associated with higher degrees of obesity (body mass index (BMI) > 35). Although it is known that the FAIM2 gene codifies an evolutionary conserved inhibitor of Fas-mediated apoptosis [21-23] and the apoptotic pathways are higher in obesity [43,44], the mechanisms by which this association occurs are not known. As we have found for the first time, a strong association between this polymorphism and resting heart rate, as well as with diastolic blood pressure (DBP), we can hypothesize on the influence of the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism.",81bf2dd6-73eb-4646-8665-78948ea69f81
33,discussion1," Thus, the minor allele may give rise to a variant resulting in less FAIM2 gene expression or activity. Hence minor allele carriers seem to be less protected against apoptosis and appear to present higher levels (despite their magnitude being small) of harmful cardiovascular risk phenotypes (greater obesity, higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and higher resting heart rate), contributing over time increasing the potential risk of myocardial infarction. Although the functions of the FAIM2 in the different metabolic diseases are not well known, it is known that the FAIM2 acts as an antiapoptotic protein which would inhibit Fas-mediated cell death [45]. Moreover a growing body of evidence has shown that Fas-mediated apoptosis is involved in atherosclerosis progression [25,45,46]. A study in rats [47] suggested that the augmented expression of apoptotic signalling by the Fas/FasL pathway plays an important role in hypertensive nephrosclerosis.",612fb611-42c1-4e6b-a3fa-b6aa24168bcb
34,discussion2," In humans it has also been reported that hypertensive subjects present a greater expression of the FAS gene [48]. In addition, greater serum concentrations of both Fas and FasL have been associated with type-2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease [24,33,34,45,49,50]. In our study, we have described for the first time a statistically significant association between the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism and higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP), which was independent from body mass index (BMI) and remained significant even after correction for multiple comparisons. Although in a previous study on Chinese subjects [26] the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism was associated with higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in children, this association did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for body mass index (BMI).",c1c8316b-dcd4-40e5-bde0-d1cb60eefa3f
35,discussion3," Moreover, as far as we know, no previous study has reported an association between the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism and heart rate, this association being greater and statistically significant in type 2 diabetic subjects. Moreover, we not only observed this association at baseline but also after analyzing the association of this polymorphism with heart rate longitudinally. The fact that this novel association was found consistently during the 5 years of follow-up in a sub-group of individuals provides greater consistency to this association.  On the other hand, when we studied the modulation of these effects by the MedDiet we did not observe any statistically significant interaction either in the study at baseline or following intervention with MedDiet over 4.8 years follow-up. Future studies are therefore required to better characterize the possible interactions with more specific dietary components.",67ee24ba-ea13-4b21-b904-e2c9b7d7c79a
36,discussion4," Numerous studies have reported that increased heart rate is a predictor of cardiovascular events and specifically of myocardial infarction [29,51-54]. In our study, we observed that the polymorphism was nominally (P < 0.041) associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction in type 2 diabetes subjects. This would be in line with previous studies that have reported higher apoptosis in type 2 diabetic subjects [33,34,55], greater association between increased heart rate and cardiovascular morbid-mortality in type-2 diabetes subjects [29,30,56] and with studies showing that apoptosis in cardiomyocytes is a very important risk factor in triggering myocardial infarction [57,58]. However, in our study this association did not remain statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. This correction is a hotly debated issue in biomedical literature, many authors being opposed to such corrections because of the increase in false negative results.",f1ce5ef4-bc0a-4231-927e-764868d3e87c
37,discussion5," Only one previous study [32], has examined the association between the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism and cardiovascular disease, and no statistical association was found. There are many differences between our study and the Chinese population analyzed and further research is needed into this issue. Another of the polymorphisms associated with obesity in recent GWAs (the rs4923461 polymorphism in the BNDF gene) has been associated with higher cardiovascular risk regardless of body mass index (BMI) [59], so providing new evidence of the pleiotropic effects of obesity-related polymorphisms.",50be09e3-5b13-4d37-89e2-76c5310d73dc
38,discussion6,"  Limitations Our study has several limitations, one of them being the relatively low number of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction and stroke) that reduces the statistical power for detecting statistically significant associations between the FAIM2 polymorphism and cardiovascular events as well as to detect gene-diet interactions between the polymorphism and MedDiet intervention in determining cardiovascular events. In line with this observation, we may also have statistical power limitations to detect gene-diet interaction in determining heart rate in the follow-up because only a sub-group of subjects had data at 5-y. At baseline, our sample size consisting of 7,161 subjects was high and allowed us to detect as statistically significant differences in heart rate or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) around unit. These associations although statistically significant were small in magnitude and may be clinically non-relevant.",7aa6cbd4-b650-41c7-b722-4beefa2e3db8
39,discussion7,"  Conclusions In conclusion, the results of our study confirm the association between the FAIM2-rs7138803 polymorphism and obesity risk, being greater for higher degrees of obesity. Moreover we provide new data on the association between this polymorphism and higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate regardless of body mass index (BMI), these associations being higher in subjects with type 2 diabetes. In addition, the association of the polymorphism with heart rate was consistently found over the follow-up, adding more evidence to this novel association. All of this may contribute to the fact that homozygous subjects for the variant allele tended to have a higher risk of myocardial infarction than the other genotypes in type 2 diabetic subjects. This association, although nominally significant did not pass the correction for multiple comparisons and needs to be replicated in further studies.",6c0eee3f-aa41-46c9-9c54-d1a8e39db365
