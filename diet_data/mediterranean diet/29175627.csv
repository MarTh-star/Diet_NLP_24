0,introduction0,"Excess of visceral adipose tissue (Visceral adipose tissue (VAT)), which appears with increasing age, has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and all cause-mortality, beyond general obesity [1]. The evaluation of how modifiable lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity (PA) influence Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) depot, may help to develop preventive strategies to combat the morbimortality associated to obesity.  There is growing evidence supporting a negative association between aerobic PA and Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), suggesting that, for Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) reduction, the intensity and volume of PA appears to be especially important [2–5].",56757dae-69ec-4589-85e8-baff86959079
1,introduction1," In this regard, moderate-to-vigorous PA (moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA)) has been shown to exert greater effect on Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) than activities at lower intensities [2,6], albeit the role of low intensity PA, as well as the exact influence of exercise volume on Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), has not been clearly established yet [7]. Additionally, sedentary behaviours (SB), have been associated with the increment of Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in some studies [3,8] but not in others [4,9]. Moreover, previously published cross-sectional results from the PREDIMED-Plus trial showed that moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) and SB were associated in opposite directions with the prevalence of abdominal obesity, determined by waist circumference (WC) [10]; hence, more detailed investigation of the association between PA and SB with Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is warranted, particularly given that studies in this field are typically hampered by small sample size.",67e9eb22-b786-4c40-9a66-4d38120cf008
2,introduction2,"  Not only PA or SB, but also lifestyle changes targeting dietary patterns—and particularly the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet)—has been associated with lower abdominal fat accumulation [11–13]. Moreover, it has been suggested that some of the effects of this dietary pattern on the incidence of chronic diseases are mediated by its effect on the accumulation of Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) [14]. In this sense, results from the recent PREDIMED trial have shown that intervention with MedDiet may counteract the harmful effects of increased abdominal adiposity on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [15]. However, previous studies addressing this issue were based on the anthropometric measurements of WC, as proxy indicator of visceral fat. Future studies with precise imaging-defined measures of Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) are needed to elucidate whether MedDiet is able to exert favorable changes in this pathogenic fat deposition.",3da2fa31-946d-4895-8d14-d1902c6bd4b6
3,introduction3,"  Based on aforementioned considerations, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cross-sectional associations between lifestyle factors, i.e. time spend in different intensity levels of PA, SB and adherence to MedDiet with Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) depot, assessed accurately by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)). The association between Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and objectively measured indicator of muscle strength was also addressed, in order to support the analysis with self-reported PA and SB.",067a7890-4b8b-48de-8ccd-6cd04f15c11e

5,introduction5," The intervention group (IG) received personalized recommendations during face-to-face individual sessions with dieticians (1/month during the first year and 1/3 months afterwards), in order to increase progressively their levels of PA (to at least 150 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity), an adherence to an erMedDiet and behavioral support. In addition to the individual meetings, all participants received group sessions (and telephone calls) 1/month in the IG and 1/6 months in the CG, to provide informative talks addressing healthy lifestyle, during which free extra-virgin olive oil (1 L/month) and raw nuts (125 g/month) were provided in both groups. The intervention will last for 6 years, with a further 2 years of follow-up for collection of clinical events.  Of a total of 9677 individuals assessed for eligibility during the 4-week run-in period, a sample of 6874 participants were recruited and randomized between 2013 and 2016 in 23 Spanish centers.",afb7a9cb-0706-4bae-bea2-cc715bd9e9ef

Of those, 1289 participants from 6 centers had data on Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) within the android region, as these centers had access to the latest software to derive Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from the dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans (CoreScan). Participants with no data available on any of the exposure variables or the covariables, and whose dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements exceeded planned time of dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) exploration were excluded from the analyses (n = 58).

8,introduction8,"  Exposure assessment Total leisure-time PA was assessed using the validated self-reported REGICOR questionnaire [18], which includes questions to collect information about the type of activity, frequency (number of days) and duration (min/day). An intensity code was assigned to each activity based on the compendium of PA in Metabolic Equivalent Tasks (METs) [19]. The information about 6 types of activities performed during a conventional month (excluding special situations like holidays or periods of sick leave) was collected by trained interviewer and categorized into three PA intensity levels: light (<4 MET)—walking at a slow/normal pace; moderate (4–5.5 MET)—brisk walking, working in the garden; and vigorous (≥6.0 MET)—walking in the countryside, climbing stairs, exercise or play sports at home, outdoors or in a gym.",74ad70c3-ed2d-433a-8d1d-df952993f0cf
9,introduction9," Total PA was estimated as the summed product of frequency, duration and intensity of each activity divided by 30 days/month (MET·min/day), and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was calculated as the sum of moderate and vigorous PA.  Time spent on SB, defined as any behavior conducted awake with an energy cost ≤1.5 MET while in a sitting or reclining posture [20], was evaluated on weekdays and weekends with the validated Nurses’ Health Study questionnaire [21]. The questionnaire consisted of a four of open-ended questions assessing the average daily time spent over the last year in watching TV, sitting while using computer, sitting on journeys (for work purposes or leisure time, as driver or passenger car, subway, bus, etc) and total sitting (counting any time spend sitting). Answers included 12 categories ranging from 0 to 9 h/day of sitting time for the corresponding activity.",1491d0e8-dc0d-4240-b064-65d76964cb62

We also used data on objectively measured muscle strength, as a supportive analysis for the association between PA and SB with Visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Lower-limb muscle strength/physical fitness was determined at baseline using previously validated in community-dwelling older subjects 30-s chair-stand test [23]. This test consists on counting the number of stand-sit on a chair cycles within 30 seconds.  Baseline adherence to an erMedDiet was assessed using of the 17-point screening questionnaire collecting data with reference to the last year [17](S1 Table). This is the modified version of 14-item dietary questionnaire previously validated in Spanish population [24].",6ed89194-c13d-453f-9cc6-2d361c452818

The final score ranged from 0 to 17 was developed; the higher the score, the better adherence to the MedDiet.  For the sensitivity analysis, another Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) was constructed as described by Trichopoulou et al. [25], considering the consumption of nine food groups or nutrients (cereals, fruits & nuts, vegetables, legumes, fish, meat, dairy products, ratio of mono-unsaturated to saturated fatty acids and alcohol), based on the data collected in previously validated 143-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) referred to food intake over last year [26].

For Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) measures, scans were reanalyzed using validated CoreScan software application [28], which algorithms work through detection of the width of the subcutaneous (subcutaneous (SAT)) layer on the lateral part of the abdomen and the anterior–posterior thickness of the abdomen, by X-ray attenuation of the abdominal cavity in the android region.

Covariable assessment Baseline data on sex, age, smoking habits, educational level, marital status, medical conditions and medication use have been evaluated using self-reported questionnaires on socio-demographic factors. Body weight (kg) and height (cm) were measured in light clothing and without shoes with use of calibrated scale and a wall-mounted stadiometer, respectively. Blood samples collected after overnight fast were used to performed biochemical analyses, such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, %) using standard routine methods.

30,discussion0,"It is well accepted that an excessive Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) accumulation, which appears while aging, carries associated metabolic disturbances, and increased mortality risk. Therefore, identification and development of strategies to prevent or decrease Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is of high importance. Yet, it is unclear the contribution of lifestyle factors toward Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) modification, as most of the studies addressing this issue are severely hampered by small sample size or lack of accurate methods for Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) measurement. Thus, we used here dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) imaging technique to precisely measure visceral fat in the large cohort of older adults with overweight/obesity and MetS. Among the lifestyle factors studied, we found that total and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) (but not light PA), as well as total SB (but not TV-viewing SB) were associated with Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) depot (opposite directions).",b43a1c0b-4844-4e70-bdc8-0365fcccef31
31,discussion1," In this cross-sectional study, adherence to MedDiet was not significantly related to this pathogenic fat depot. Results of this study on the negative association between total PA, in terms of total energy expenditure, and imaging defined Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) depot corroborate most of previous cross-sectional [3,32,33] and interventional studies [6,34], conducted among different populations of adults, using self-reported [33,35,36] and accelerometry-derived PA data [3,32].  Mounting evidence point out the greater benefits of moderate-to-vigorous PA over light PA on health-related changes in adults (≥65 years or less), including lower rates of all-cause mortality, cardiorespiratory and metabolic diseases, osteoporosis, some cancers and depression [37]. Furthermore, elderly individuals may be unable to perform PA at higher intensity, giving a reason to focus on the role of light PA.",4feb4d62-43c5-4eb3-9edb-877d37dc9b3b
32,discussion2," The present analysis of PA intensities suggests that moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) is favorable for Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) reduction in older overweight/obese subjects, while light PA has no significant association with this pathogenic depot. Our findings, although based on the self-reported data, are in line with other large cross-sectional studies performed in middle-age to elderly populations using both accelerometry and imaging techniques [3,4,32]. These observational findings have been supported in different exercise regimes. In a meta-analysis, Vissers et al. concluded that aerobic exercise training of moderate or high intensities in people with overweight/obesity reduces Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) more effectively than low intensity or strength training [2]. Therefore, it is plausible that an intensity threshold exists for PA to reduce Visceral adipose tissue (VAT).",02d0c97d-3eb6-4e31-baf4-cef8b70cdeea
33,discussion3," However, the exact importance of PA levels for older adult population needs to be addressed in long-term studies, using preferentially relative intensities or correction for a cardiorespiratory capacity that tends to decrease with age, instead of absolute intensities (METs thresholds determined in younger adults), which are likely to underestimate time spent on moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) [38].  Regarding PA volume, current World Health Organization (WHO) health strategies for adults indicate that engaging between 150 and 300 min of moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) weekly is necessary for obesity management and overall health purposes. Findings from this study extend this knowledge, demonstrating that meeting these recommendations offer additional benefit for positive Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) outcomes.",fc0e752b-bc67-48a2-9714-89f4a8e306a0
34,discussion4," Our results corroborate those from the systematic review of clinical trials which showed that as little as 10 MET h/week (150 min/week) of moderate PA is adequate for Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) reduction [39]. Increasing moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) time over 300 min/week was associated with further reduction in Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) although of lower magnitude. In line with our study, other authors observed a dose-response effect for greater intra-abdominal fat loss with increasing duration of exercise interventions [5,34].  In general, SB is associated with detrimental health outcomes and minimizing SB, as a public health strategy has been proposed. Our study provides new findings suggesting that SB may have an association with Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), independently of PA and other potential confounders.",7e402eb6-99fe-4c6a-9d29-ee21376049dc
35,discussion5," This supports previous findings from other cross-sectional accelerometry-based studies which targeted older individuals with a high risk of chronic diseases and metabolic dysfunction [3,8], but not with studies on younger or healthier subjects [4,40]. Furthermore, we found that time spent on TV-viewing was not significantly associated with Visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Similarly, Wilmot et al. concluded in a meta-analysis that TV-viewing may be a poor measure of overall SB, underestimating the true effect of overall sitting-related SB on health outcomes [41]. Undoubtedly, further research is required to better understand the associations among different domains of SB and adiposity.  In addition, when SB was categorized, we observed that the greatest benefits on Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) reduction were observed when time on SB was lower than 4 h/d.",f5638d4b-1c6c-4fd8-b557-a74ec3f18d21
36,discussion6," This threshold has been associated to strongest reduction in obesity (including its central type) [42] and overall mortality in previous studies [31,40]. Furthermore, analyses on the joint association between PA and SB demonstrated that the strongest effect estimate was detected when low sedentarism (<4 h/d) was accompanied of 150–300 min/week of moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), with a reduction of nearly 0.5 kg of Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), compared to those that were sedentary and engaged in little or no moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). The combination of longer time spent on SB, and particularly watching TV, and not meeting moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) recommendations has been previously associated with greater risk for obesity and T2D [10], increases in WC [43] and with highest amount of computed tomography-measured Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) [35].",0b826669-4a9e-456f-92ef-c145bff82bdb
37,discussion7," Thus, although we found SB and PA independently associated with Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), it seems that their relationship may be additive. This emphasizes that making recommendations related to Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) deposition should encourage both reducing sedentary time, and increasing PA.  Total body fat was not included to the minimally sufficient adjustment set in our DAG, given that this variable may act as a mediator of the aforementioned associations. Still, we decided to adjust for it in sensitivity analyses to determine the “direct effect” of PA, SB and erMedDiet on Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) independently of total body fat. These resulted in an attenuation of the associations and loss of statistical significance. This could indicate that any effect of PA and SB on Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) will be a consequence of an overall reduction in total body fat.",5ec6f31c-a893-46fe-91c1-2ad9bb53005a
38,discussion8," Or that, given that Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) constitutes a very small percentage of total fat in this population (8.4% in men and 4.9% in women) it is difficult to elucidate whether PA and SB exert specific effects on Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) beyond those on body composition. Previous studies which addressed different adipose tissue depots showed that health benefits from engaging PA were related to an overall favorable reduction in total body fat and both Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) abdominal fat components [32,34,36]. This might support, at least partly, findings from our study, and confirm the need for future studies to elucidate the mechanism underlying the association of inactivity and activity with Visceral adipose tissue (VAT).  The potential of MedDiet as a treatment strategy to reduce central obesity has been firmly evidenced in observational studies [11,12] and in the intervention trials [13,14], with the use of surrogate measures (i.e.",31b72c2a-014b-4209-9bca-2b4a1cf996da
39,discussion9," WC) for Visceral adipose tissue (VAT). However, the use of anthropometry for central obesity evaluation does not differentiate between either fat and lean mass or Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue within the abdomen. Among very sparse studies that addressed to investigate aforementioned association with precise imaging-defined measures, as ultrasonography [44] or magnetic resonance imaging [45], an inverse relation between MedDiet and Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was confirmed. In turn, in our analysis we could not support findings from the previous authors, as the association did not reach statistical significance, albeit the same tendency to decline dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was observed among those participants with better adherence to an energy-restricted MedDiet.",f1c81d6d-1dbd-4b0e-8868-312e3d66a928
40,discussion10," In a sensitivity analyses, the use of the widely applied Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was only borderline significantly associated to Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in crude models only, but lost statistical significance after adjusting for PA and other variables. These null findings could indicate that the Mediterranean diet is not specifically associated to this fat depot in obese participants; or could be a result of bias prevalent in cross-sectional studies, such as missreporting of diet in the obese or reverse causation. For the future considerations, it would be of interest to evaluate the effect of MedDiet intervention on Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) at the prospective level within the PREDIMED-Plus trial.  A marked strength of this study was the use of large, and at the same time, homogeneous sample of men and women within narrow ranges of body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), age and metabolic health profile.",87b97669-4e83-47bb-8e74-db0aa1591719
41,discussion11," Another strong point was the use of dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) imaging technique with CoreScan automated algorithms to determine Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) amount, which is a reliable and valid method for this fat depot estimation. Furthermore, to avoid confounding for the associations of interest, the analyses were controlled for a number of factors, which were selected with use of validated and objective DAG tool within DAGitty software. Finally, additional analyses were performed showing that obtained results are not modifiable by sex, age and diabetes status.  As far as the limitations are concerned, the cross-sectional design was the major restriction that impedes inference regarding causality of the associations found. Selection of older subjects with overweight/obesity and MetS for the study cohort limits extrapolation of findings to other populations, as younger, leaner or healthier subjects, and stands for reverse causation bias.",7697a984-ec7b-4696-b26c-f4448c07737f
42,discussion12," Furthermore, the present study used self-reported questionnaires to obtain data on PA, SB and erMedDiet score, which might be subject to potential biases, even though the questionnaires were validated. In order to support the self-reported data from PA and SB questionnaires, data derived from the chair-stand test, as a proxy indicator for physical fitness and lower-limb muscle strength in elderly, was included. Moreover, moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) activity levels used in our analysis might have been underestimated, as we did not have taken into account or adjusted for person´s functional mobility, as well as cardiorespiratory or aerobic capacity that decreases with age. Lastly, our study was limited to single-race (Caucasians), hence the associations found may not be applicable to another ethnic/racial group.",ad9c3a4c-e332-41c7-a2e0-427dce562bf6
43,discussion13," Due to the racial heterogeneity in lifestyle habits and fat distribution within different depots, it would be of interest to replicate our findings in diverse populations and further confirm longitudinally the present observations.  Conclusions In conclusion, results from this cross-sectional study revealed that in older subjects with overweigh/obesity and MetS, total and moderate-to-vigorous PA (but not light PA) is associated inversely, and total time spent on SB positively with Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) depot. In a broader context, our findings give valuable clue for clinical practice and research on which lifestyle-based methods are effective in combating morbimortality associated with obesity in this particular group of subjects. However, more studies are needed to confirm and broaden obtained data. Fortunately, since PREDIMED-Plus is an ongoing clinical trial, it will allow to extend the associations addressed here in the future longitudinal and/or interventional analysis.",8ae3709d-843f-4e9d-9092-4dd1f1d7e6f1
