0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design This study is part of an ongoing multicenter randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of a treatment program including dietary modifications, physical activity and vitamin D supplementation (DEDiCa study) on BC relapse [23], approved by the Ministry of Health Italian, Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) and the ethics committees of each recruiting hospital (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02786875). Eligible participants were found through surgical lists of participating hospitals. They were contacted by phone and offered to learn more about the study during group information sessions. Informed consent was obtained at baseline from all participants included in the study. Eligible women were randomized to follow either one of two treatments: (a) low glycemic index traditional Mediterranean diet + daily brisk walking + vitamin D supplementation; (b) traditional Mediterranean diet + avoidance of physical inactivity + vitamin D supplementation.",a606f9cf-2f08-4b26-a97a-65f8c229b183
1,methods1," Our analyses included 227 participants with complete data at baseline and 12 months. Clinic visits included the evaluation of anthropometric, dietary and biochemical parameters at baseline and at 12 months. Furthermore, through specific questionnaires we obtained information at the baseline and at 12 months on adherence to the Mediterranean diet and on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Details of these questionnaires are explained below.  2.2. Anthropometric and Physical Activity Level Measurements Anthropometric data of the participants were collected by the study staff at baseline and 12 months, specifically weight was measured to the nearest 0.5 Kg using a Seca scale (Seca 761) while height to the nearest 1 cm using a Seca stadiometer. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated using the formula weight (kg)/height (m2).  Physical activity level was assessing using a step counter (Omron Walking Style IV) provided by study staff prior to the baseline visit.",372bd6a0-2aeb-4f50-9483-3f9865e6b6ce
2,methods2," Participants wore the step counter for at least 7 days before each visit. Four categories of activity were identified: sedentary (<5000 steps/day), low activity (5000 < 7500 steps/day), medium activity (7500 < 10,000 steps/day) and high activity (≥10,000 steps/day) [24].  2.3. Adherence to Mediterranean Diet At baseline and 12-month follow-up all participants completed a 7-day food record and the 14-item questionnaire administered by study staff. The 14-point Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)), developed to control for compliance with the dietary intervention of the study Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED)) [25], was used to assess dietary adherence in people living in a Mediterranean area [26].",e7f136d0-1853-4a65-8be1-bbbb4f456704
3,methods3," Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire includes 14 questions: 12 investigate the frequency and quantity of foods (olive oil, vegetables, fruit, red or processed meats, butter, soda drinks, legumes, fish, commercial sweets, nuts, wine, sofrito sauce), while two questions are related to the preference of olive oil and meat consumption. Each question has two possible answers and scores; 1 score for “yes” and 0 for “no”. The 14-point Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) can range from 0 to 14 where 14 represents the highest adherence to Mediterranean diet.  2.4. Dietary Assessment Dietary data, including beverage intakes and alcohol consumption, were collected by a 7-day food records at baseline and 12-month follow-up. During clinic visits patients returned the food records to the nutritionist who asked supplemental questions where necessary.",95585931-4088-4a5c-ad91-5656aaee449e
4,methods4," Data were stored and processed using a professional software (WinFood©) which utilized the CREA—Alimenti e Nutrizione nutritional database. Dietary fiber was calculated as g/1000 kcal, while saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)) and monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) as percent of daily energy intake at baseline and 12-month follow-up.  2.5. Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) To assess the quality of life at baseline and 12-months, the patients completed three validated questionnaires: the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level (EQ-5D-3L) [27], the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Breast Cancer 23 items (EORTC QLQ-BR23) [28]. The EQ-5D-3L is one of most commonly used generic health-related quality-of-life questionnaire, made by the Euroqol group.",865ee4be-06b3-48c4-a9d7-136e5d698861
5,methods5," The questionnaire comprises five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression) and three levels of perceived problems (no problems, some problems and extreme problems). Another part of the questionnaire includes a visual analogue scale (EQ-visual analogue scale (VAS)) that measures patient self-perceived health status. We have used the Italian health states value set [29] to obtain a unique health index score (EQ-5D-index), where the value of 1 represents the best health status and below 1 worse health status; in addition, EQ-visual analogue scale (VAS) evaluates the participant’s self-reported health state on a scale from 0 (worse health status) to 100 best health status.  The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Questionnaire for Quality of Life Assessment in patients with cancer, version 3.",d093c04d-a419-4fc6-9db2-bc7bea379dac
6,methods6,"0) is a tool for assessing quality of life in cancer patients, consisting of 30 questions subsequently transformed in 15 scales: five functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), three symptom items (fatigue, nausea or vomiting, and pain), six single items (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact) and a global health status/QoL scale [28]. The EORTC QLQ-BR23 (Quality of Life Questionnaire—Breast Cancer) assesses quality of life specifically in breast cancer patients and comprises of 23 questions that evaluate body image, sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, future perspective, systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms and distress from hair loss. For each question there are four answers (not at all, a little, quite a bit, very much). All items are linearly transformed to a 0–100 scale according to a standardized process described in EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual 3rd Edition [30].",9ac52e41-97b4-4b2d-9bec-6695269c53e3
7,methods7," Higher scores for functioning and for global health status indicate better health. Conversely, higher scores for symptoms indicate worse health.  In our analyses we did not include the answers to the questions related to sexual enjoyment and feeling towards hair loss because at least 50% of participants did not respond to these questions at baseline.  2.6. Biochemical Measurements Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 12 months. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured using chemiluminescent immunoassay (chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA)) technology for the quantitative determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and other hydroxylated vitamin D metabolites in human serum (LIAISON® 25 OH Vitamin D TOTAL Assay) at the Laboratory Medicine Unit. All analytes were measured in the coordinating hospital routine analytical laboratory (Laboratory Medicine Unit, Istituto Nazionale Tumori—IRCCS “Fondazione G. Pascale”, Napoli, Italy) after quality control procedures.  2.7.",48ec1478-e644-47f3-a44f-b7e5dc2683e2
8,methods8," Statistical Analyses The present analysis includes data from the first 227 women enrolled in DEDiCa study with complete data at baseline and 12 months. Baseline characteristics were described as numbers (n) and percentages (%). Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were summarized using tabulations for categorical variables and means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables. Means and SD were calculated for all HRQoL dimensions, as well as anthropometric parameters, step count, 25(OH)D levels, dietary measurement at baseline and at 12-month follow-up and changes from baseline were compared with the analysis of variance (ANOVA). These analyses were also performed in strata of Body mass index (BMI) at baseline (<25 kg/m2 vs. ≥25 kg/m2) and in strata of hormone therapy use at 12 months (treatment vs no treatment). Considering there were no significant differences in HRQoL between randomization arms at 12 months, data from both groups were analyzed together.",69cd66f2-b3be-481e-b796-32f3b86f90c8
9,methods9," Multiple linear regression models adjusted for terms of age, civil status, education, time from surgery, Body mass index (BMI), step count, 25(OH)D level, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score, dietary fiber intake, monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) and saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)) intakes were performed to assess the association between changes in HRQoL dimensions and selected covariates. The dependent variables were changes in the HRQoL domains and the independent variables were the lifestyle treatment components at baseline, 12 months and their time changes. The dependent variables were chosen based on significant ANOVA variation from baseline to 12 months. Results are reported as estimates beta coefficients, p value and R2 adjusted for the goodness of the model.

Results Baseline characteristics of randomized participants (n = 227) are shown in Table 1. Mean age (±SD) was 52.3 ± 9.3 years (45% < 50 years), mean body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was 27.3 kg/m2 ± 5.8 (43% normal weight, 31% overweight and 26% obese), 52.4% non-smokers, 76.3% were inactive and 62.6% showed adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The majority of participants, 96% were postmenopausal (natural or pharmacologically induced), 81.1% were married or common-law and 65.6% attained high school or higher education. Moreover, Table 1 shows cancer characteristics including staging, molecular subtypes and oncologic treatment. Patients undertaking hormone therapy were 54.6% while 16% were still receiving adjuvant chemotherapy at baseline. Participants who reported at least one comorbidity at baseline were 41%: 5.7% reported type 2 diabetes, 23.",62c12c64-2e42-4eff-87a1-a511574baf79

After 12 months, most participants showed high adherence to lifestyle treatment resulting in increased Mediterranean diet adherence, higher intakes of dietary fiber and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and lower intakes of saturated fatty acids (SFA), increased physical activity and circulating vitamin D levels increased reached sufficiency (≥30 ng/mL) in 70% of participants (Figure 1a–c).  In the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, compared to baseline, at 12 months we observed that patients had significantly higher scores for physical functioning (p = 0.003), role functioning (p = 0.002), and social functioning (p < 0.001); among symptoms, at 12 months patients had significantly lower scores for fatigue (p < 0.001), nausea and vomiting (p = 0.015), dyspnea (p = 0.001), constipation (p = 0.049) and financial difficulties (p = 0.012).

In the breast cancer specific questionnaire EORTC QLQ-BR23, at 12 months participants had significantly higher scores for body image (p < 0.001) and future perspective (p < 0.001) but lower scores for sexual functioning (p = 0.025). Among symptoms, at 12 months patients had significantly lower scores for systematic therapy side effects (p < 0.001) and breast symptoms (p = 0.004) (Table 2, Figure 3a). Reductions in arm symptom scores were also observed albeit not significantly (p = 0.104). The EQ-5D-3L questionnaire showed significantly higher scores for the visual analogue scale (visual analogue scale (VAS)) (74.6 vs. 68.6; p = 0.001) at 12 months, indicating improved overall wellbeing (Table 2, Figure 3b).",660db604-814d-437c-980a-e0ba416cfc99
13,methods13,"  When data were stratified by baseline Body mass index (BMI), changes in scores for HRQoL components did not differ significantly at 12 months compared to baseline, except for EQ-5D-3L index scores which significantly increased in normal weight patients indicating improved health status and decreased in overweight/obese (0.034 ± 0.077 vs. −0.013 ± 0.094; p < 0.001, respectively). When stratifying data by hormone therapy use at 12 months, we observed significantly higher scores for body image in patients not taking hormone therapy compared to those taking hormone therapy (18.0 ± 20.8 vs. 10.0 ± 24.6; p = 0.038, respectively; data not shown) while reductions in sexual functioning were significantly higher in patients not taking hormone therapy compared to those taking hormone therapy (−9.7 ± 22.8 vs. −2.6 ± 20.2; p =0.039, respectively; data not shown).

Discussion Quality of life improved in women recently diagnosed with BC undertaking oncologic and lifestyle treatments. Compared to baseline, increases were found in global health status, self-perceived health status and functional scales, in most domains, while decreases were found in symptom scales for most items, after 12 months. Specifically, we observed improvements in physical functioning, role functioning and social functioning, and reductions in fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, constipation and financial difficulties.  We found that scores improved in functional scales for body image and future prospective, and in systematic therapy side effects and breast symptoms, after 12 months of lifestyle modifications.",8f5a4fbe-2bf2-4226-9517-d22a4607b222
15,methods15," The increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet measured by Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire and by increased dietary fiber and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) with reduced saturated fatty acids (SFA) intakes, by the increased step count and by the normalization of vitamin D levels, confirm that lifestyle modifications were implemented.  Although our multivariate analyses did not show that many of the above treatment components singularly explained changes in HRQoL components (except for vitamin D) the model indicated that changes in Body mass index (BMI) were inversely related to changes in global health status indicating improved HRQoL in those who lost weight. This finding has been confirmed by others [31]. Among women who completed the 12-month treatment, two-thirds were overweight/obese at baseline and showed an average weight loss of 1.9 kg despite the majority were taking oncological hormone therapy which is known to increase body weight [32].",5a03e3b5-3e2d-49f7-be31-6f3a18e077c6
16,methods16," Weight loss in a lifestyle modification trial could be due to dietary and exercise modifications which is in line with our findings of significantly improved diet quality and physical activity after 12 months.  We had previously demonstrated that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet in BC survivors was associated with higher HRQoL, particularly for physical functioning, sleep, pain and overall well-being [4]. Generally, a healthy dietary pattern is associated with better HRQoL [17,18,33,34] including fatigue which is prevalent in BC survivors and is associated with shorter overall survival [35]. Dietary intervention rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acid-rich foods, which are staple foods of the Mediterranean diet, significantly decreased cancer-related fatigue and improved sleep quality in BC survivors [34].",184c7d47-24b5-4c51-b1c3-825f491b01da
17,methods17," A possible mechanism for the relationship between a healthy diet and HRQoL may be through inflammation [36,37] and the Mediterranean diet has been previously associated with reduced inflammation [38]. Considering the increased life expectancy of BC survivors, adherence to a healthy diet may offer multiple health benefits including reduced cardiovascular disease risk, the most common comorbidity and cause of death in BC survivors [9] which can also negatively impact on quality of life. Furthermore, a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases and overall mortality [39,40].  Physical exercise is another lifestyle component that can positively influence cancer outcomes and treatment-related side effects, quality of life, BC recurrence, and overall survival in BC patients [8].",570efcf3-180b-4472-b4c4-eada41ce1bf4
18,methods18," During our 12-month lifestyle treatment participants increased physical activity level and the number of physically active patients increased from 54 to 86 while the number of sedentary patients decreased from 104 to 71 after 12 months. Physical activity is one of the mainstays of cancer prevention and it is also included in guidelines for BC survivors [41]. Higher physical activity was related to better quality of life in BC patients shortly after adjuvant treatments [42] and it positively influenced cancer- and treatment-related side effects including fatigue and peripheral neuropathy as well as aromatase inhibitor-related arthralgia [8,20,42,43].  Vitamin D may be another treatment component in our study influencing HRQoL. In our study we found significant increases in circulating vitamin D after 12-month supplementation, with 70% of patients reaching sufficiency from 27% at baseline.",935a9f82-125c-4f11-9d48-0ca6b3ecf29b
19,methods19," Multivariate analyses indicated that increased serum vitamin D levels were indeed associated with lower scores for systematic therapy side effects. Although we did not find a significant reduction in pain, there was a trend towards less pain severity at 12 months, although worsening of pain symptoms was expected over time due to side effects of oncologic hormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) considering the higher number of patients taking hormone therapy at 12-month (77%) compared to baseline (55%). Vitamin D is known to exert a wide range of health effects, including those relating to musculoskeletal structure. Considering the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in BC survivors, it is likely that suboptimal vitamin D levels may contribute to the increased incidence and severity of musculoskeletal symptoms experienced by aromatase inhibitor-treated women.",060c71f1-4cf0-4da3-b0f8-e8b5def2a278
20,methods20," It has been reported that non-deficient vitamin D levels and vitamin D supplement use were associated with higher self-reported quality of life in BC survivors [44]. Other studies found beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on musculoskeletal pain in BC patients receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy [22,45,46]. Among adverse effects of aromatase inhibitors, pain has a negative impact on quality of life, on treatment compliance and on survival of BC patients [47,48,49,50]. A possible mechanism for the beneficial effect of vitamin D arthralgia and myalgia may be its anti-inflammatory activity.  The present study has some strengths and limitations. Data derives from a multicenter clinical trial where participants were closely followed with quarterly visits, all measurements were collected from centrally trained research staff and all analyses were performed in a central research location. This allowed to collect a large number of covariates which were used in our analyses.",bb669e6f-c470-40b7-be6b-54e42a5b5f69
21,methods21," Limitations include HRQoL as secondary end point of DEDiCa trial which has a different aim [23] and we did not compare the intervention to the control group for the purpose of the current analysis. Patients were enrolled at different stages of cancer treatment which may have differently affected HRQoL. Although response-shift may affect quality of life outcomes [51] our study included patients enrolled within one year of surgery. At baseline only 16% of participants in the study were still receiving chemotherapy, 50% completed chemotherapy treatment and 34% did not receive chemotherapy treatment, therefore it is unlikely that chemotherapy influenced HRQoL significantly. When we repeated analysis stratifying patients by hormone therapy use at 12 months we found similar results for most components of the HRQoL questionnaires.",f5dec504-f9c7-4e9c-84e9-b7c5baa60431
22,methods22," Finally, we repeated analysis stratifying patients by Body mass index (BMI) at baseline and we found similar results for most components of the HRQoL questionnaires, except for EQ-5D-3L index scores (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) where higher scores were seen in normal weight patients and lower scores in overweight and obese patients. Finally, reporting findings at 12 months, instead of 24 or 36 months, may decrease the likelihood of significant HRQoL changes due to lifestyle modifications which may be shadowed by the strong therapy side effects in the first year which tend to subside afterwards.  5. Conclusions To date, there are few studies evaluating the effects of a combined lifestyle program on HRQoL in BC survivors. Our study analyzed and reported in details quality of life aspects in BC patients after a lifestyle program of dietary modification, daily walking and vitamin D supplementation.",8c62ae90-9098-46ad-9df5-039109f55291
23,methods23," In conclusion, a healthy lifestyle modification of traditional Mediterranean diet and exercise may impact positively on HRQoL in BC survivors possibly through reductions in body weight while correcting vitamin D sufficiency may improve BC-related symptoms. These findings are relevant to BC survivors whose lower HRQoL negatively affects treatment compliance and disease outcomes. Future studies on BC survivors should be carried out considering these findings to determine the relationship between lifestyle factors and HRQoL in BC survivors and to investigate mechanisms.
