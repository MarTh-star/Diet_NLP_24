0,methods0," Design and Procedure  Permission was obtained to conduct this Chinese translation and validation study from the first author of the Canadian version of the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS), in September 2020. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research with Human Subjects at Xinhua Hospital, affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University school of Medicine (Ethics number: XHEC-C-2020-078), and was registered in the Chinese Clinical Registration Center (clinical trial registry number: No. Chi CTR2000032810; clinical trial website: http://www.chictr.org.cn/enIndex.aspx). All the participants signed the informed consent forms before commencement of data collection.  The study consisted of two phases. First, translation, cultural adaptation, and clarity test were done which involved the following steps (24): (1) The forward translation process was independently completed by two physical therapists who were proficient in both the English and Chinese languages.",bbe7d676-c49d-4363-9bf5-c1d225707de5
1,methods1," After obtaining two Chinese versions, an expert panel composed of one professor of cardiology and one professor of physiotherapy checked the translation and synthesized them into one version. (2) The backward translation was completed by an English professor. In order to ensure the quality of this step, the English professor did not know that backward translation work was being done and was not familiar with the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS). A detailed review by the expert panel followed to focus on the comparison between the backward translation version and the original English version and to ensure that the semantic consistency rate reached 90%. (3) The cultural adaptation process was performed by an expert team including two professors of dietetics, one professor of cardiology, two senior cardiologists, three professors of physiotherapy, one professor of nursing, and one chief nurse in cardiology.",0b460579-4d6e-43c2-8613-11dfe757def3
2,methods2," Collectively they reviewed the Chinese version and the experts' opinions, and made suggestions that were collated and analyzed to improve the accuracy and clarity of each item. (4) A preliminary test was conducted in at least 10 Chinese participants with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia) to evaluate the clarity of the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese form. In the final step of this phase, feedback was analyzed to further revise the scale.  In the second phase, the psychometric properties of the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese were evaluated by a cross-sectional survey. This included content validity, construct validity, criterion validity, internal consistency, and test–retest reliability.  For content validity, the expert team, who were involved in the cultural adaptation process, evaluated item content.",0a1b2428-a61b-4134-8846-40741ce60920
3,methods3," Experts were asked to rate each item on a 4-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 = completely uncorrelated to 4 = strongly correlated) based on the content applicability and the clarity of the phrasing (25, 26).  For construct validity, the study recruited 326 participants for validity testing so as to safely exceed the recommendation of a sample size of 10 participants per item (27). All the participants answered a total of 13 questions in the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese. Participants were asked to answer each question with a “yes” or “no” response, where an answer of “yes” equated to one point. The higher the score, the higher was the adherence to the MD pattern.",052efcdd-418a-48cf-8a35-4fc272813980
4,methods4,"  For criterion validity, the 326 participants also completed the Chinese form of the Coronary Artery Disease Education Questionnaire–Short Version (CADE-Q SV), which is a tool to assess patients' knowledge about cardiovascular disease (CVD) (28), as it has been shown that participants with good knowledge about cardiovascular disease (CVD) and nutrition have a higher level of adherence to the MD pattern (29–31). The score for the CADE-Q SV and the diet dimension score of CADE-Q SV were thus obtained together with the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese score.  For internal consistency and test-retest reliability, 50 participants were randomly selected to complete the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese instrument again after a 1-week interval, based on the recommendation for test-retest analysis (32).",405d240e-eb30-4d7f-934e-c7ca744fd9e3
5,methods5,"  Participants  Participants included all patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the Department of Cardiology from Xinhua Hospital between September 2020 and July 2021. Inclusion criteria included: ① Clinically diagnosed cardiovascular disease (CVD) or multiple cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia); ② Mini Mental State Examination (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) ≥24 (33); ③ native language is Chinese; ④ age ≥18 years. The exclusion criteria were: ① Unable to complete the questionnaire independently for any reason (such as being illiterate or having visual dysfunction); ② inability to eat by mouth or food restrictions or diets that do not include meat and fish (i.e.",368b992d-2078-4d51-8b57-e9d5631e0eae
6,methods6,", food allergies to legumes, nuts, olive oil, fish, or seafood, or being vegetarian or vegan); ③ individuals living in a retirement home (set menus are provided by the institutions); ④ having experienced or undergoing cardiac rehabilitation (CR).  Statistical Analysis  SPSS Version 25.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) was used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics was applied to the demographic data, and knowledge scores and the difference scores were analyzed by Multi-Factor Variance Analysis. Continuous variables were presented as mean values and standard deviation (x¯±s), while categorical/nominal variables were presented as frequencies and percentages.  Content validity was evaluated by the expert team, and was assessed by the content validity index (content validity index (CVI)) (25, 26). content validity index (CVI) of each item (I-content validity index (CVI)) was calculated by using the number of the score≥3 divided by the total number of the experts.",485e51e2-4051-4d8a-9628-f0650376e4f3
7,methods7," A value of content validity index (CVI) >0.70 was regarded as acceptable (34). The content validity index (CVI) of the whole questionnaire was estimated by calculating the average content validity index (CVI) of all the items (35). Construct validity was assessed using exploratory factor analysis (exploratory factor analysis (EFA)) to explore the factorial structure of the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese, and confirmatory factor analysis (confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)) was used to examine the factorial structure. SPSS AMOS 26.0 was used for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). If exploratory factor analysis (EFA) showed Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index (Kaiser Meyer Olkin index (KMO)) >0.6, p < 0.05 for the Bartlett's Sphericity tests, and the factor loadings greater than 0.30 on only one factor, then confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted (36).",abe80139-2672-4c23-a7f3-34c771007ab5
8,methods8," confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) provides information including chi square by χ2/df, goodness-of-fit index (goodness of fit index (GFI)), comparative fit index (comparative fit index (CFI)), root mean square error of approximation (root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)), and standardized root mean square residual (square residual (SRMR)). Values of 1 ≤ χ2/df ≤ 3, goodness of fit index (GFI) > 0.90, comparative fit index (CFI) > 0.90, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) ≤ 0.08, and square residual (SRMR) < 0.08 were considered to be acceptable (36–38). Criterion validity was analyzed by Pearson's correlation, with values higher than 0.70 considered acceptable (39).  For reliability, internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha, where a value >0.60 was considered acceptable (39). Test-retest reliability was assessed via the inter-class correlation coefficient (inter class correlation reliability coefficients (ICC)) with values > 0.",8302a0eb-dc91-4aa7-b11c-efa0def59e43
9,results0," Translation, Backward Translation, and Cultural Adaptation  After review by the expert panel, semantic equivalence between the backward translation version and the original version was achieved. For cultural adaptation, the expert panel suggested that the unit reference to “ounce” be modified to “gram” to align with more commonly-used units of measurement in the Chinese language (Supplementary File) (40).  Clarity Test  Sixteen participants with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk participated in the pilot test, and evaluated its clarity. There were no unclear or ambiguous sentences in the instructions provided or the items within the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese version. The clarity scores ranged from 9.2 to 10.0 (Table 1).  Table 1 Clarity, content validity index for each item (I-content validity index (CVI)), inter-class correlation coefficient (inter class correlation reliability coefficients (ICC)), and factor loading for each item.",15c5d504-5b7c-4a70-8396-275a5b8adec7
10,results3,"  Regarding content validity, I-content validity index (CVI)s ranged from 0.80 to 1.00. content validity index (CVI) for the whole questionnaire was 0.96. The results indicated an adequate content validity of the questionnaire (Table 1).  For construct validity, the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) factorial analysis showed that the Kaiser Meyer Olkin index (KMO) was 0.68 and Bartlett's sphericity was χ2 = 622.1, p < 0.001. The four-factor loading coefficients of the model ranged from 0.54 to 0.80, and all were within the acceptable level, indicating that the data was suitable for factor analysis. confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the four-factor model established. The results showed that the model resulted in good data fitting (χ2/df = 1.651; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.045; comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.931; goodness of fit index (GFI) = 0.957; square residual (SRMR) = 0.051).",e5c4eef3-35cc-47db-a146-94164edc02d9
11,results4," Therefore, the four-factor of Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese was considered acceptable. Specifically, Factor 1 reflected items related to meats and processed foods, Factor 2—fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes, Factor 3—olive oil, and Factor 4—fish, seafood, and flavor (Table 1).  For criterion validity, the Pearson's correlation results showed that the scores of Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese were significantly correlated with that of CADE-Q SV (r = 0.73, p < 0.01) and dimension of CADE-Q SV (r = 0.70, p < 0.01).  Internal consistency as assessed by Cronbach's alpha was 0.62. With regard to reproducibility, test-retest reliability evaluated through the inter class correlation reliability coefficients (ICC) of each item showed a range from 0.73 to 0.88 (Table 1).

12,discussion0," The MD is supported by evidence as being the healthiest diet worldwide to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (41, 42). The self-administered version of the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS) is a practical and useful screening tool, and it has been widely used internationally (21, 23). This study aimed to translate and assess the validity of a newly created Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese version with those in the general population with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).  The mean total score for the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese was 7.7 ± 2.4, which was lower than that for Canadians with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (10.2 ± 1.9) (21), but the mean total score for the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese with diabetes mellitus (DM) (7.6 ± 2.3) was slightly higher than that found in Brazilian adults with DM (6.9 ± 2.0) (23).",d7b16b72-17b0-49fc-9eb3-856889106cbe
13,discussion1," It may be because of the sampling difference, since the Canadian adult post CR may have improved adherence to healthy diet behaviors (43).  The cross-cultural adaptation conducted here was completed in concordance with prior guidelines (44). Only some minor changes were made, specifically for the metric unit utilized to quantify the amount of food eaten. Preliminary pilot testing demonstrated that the instructions and all item descriptions were clear and easy to understand. The clarity of the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese was excellent with scores ranging from 9.2 to 10.0, a finding which supports it as a self-administered scale.  Psychometric analysis demonstrated that the test-retest reliability and internal consistency of the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese was acceptable, and this result is similar to findings reported for the original version (21).",8073c6f2-5bc4-41cc-809a-f5fe971884d1
14,discussion2," Content, criterion, and construct validity were acceptable for Chinese participants with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Construct validity analysis through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) demonstrated that in comparison to the original Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS), there were also four-factors in Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese (Table 1). However, item 13 (“Do you flavor foods with a combination of tomato, garlic, onions, or leeks two times or more per week?”) was assigned in different factor groups. This is presumably because different dietary opinions related to cooking habits exist between the Chinese and the western general population (40). In China, olive oil is not used with tomato, garlic, and onion (45, 46). Tomato, garlic, and onion are usually used when cooking fish, especially in coastal regions (40, 45).",6ffa238f-ef34-4890-93f4-9cd0d588d77d
15,discussion3," Thus, item 13 belongs to Factor 4 instead of Factor 3 in the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese (Table 1). Criterion validity was assessed through the scores of Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese being related to the score of CADE-Q SV and the diet dimension score of CADE-Q SV, as it is known that nutrition knowledge determines diet habits. This study has also shown that the CADE-Q SV score is strongly correlated with the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese score, a finding similar to that in other studies (29–31). For test-retest reliability and internal consistency of the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese, our results were in the acceptable range and were similar to the findings reported in the original version (21).  Limitations  There are some limitations in this study. For validation, the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese was evaluated with regard to content validity, construct validity, and criterion validity.",2557875a-9f6d-4673-bcef-4c9e04340a75
16,discussion4," However, the dietary assessment validation will be done in future studies as it was out-of-scope in the present work. In addition, given that the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS) is a self-administered instrument, there might be some participants who did not understand the questions correctly.  Conclusions  The self-administered version Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS) was translated and culturally adapted to create a Chinese version, and validated in a cohort of the Chinese population with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese version is shown to be reliable and valid for assessing the level of MD adherence in native Chinese language users. Given that diet is one of the key secondary prevention strategies for the management of CR, the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS)-Chinese could be an important tool for use with those with cardiovascular problems.",b6357424-49fe-4e69-aaf3-cffaca56db5a
