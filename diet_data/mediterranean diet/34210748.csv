0,methods0," This population-based cohort study was approved by the institutional review board at each of the participating sites. Written informed consent was obtained from participants before study initiation. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)) reporting guideline.  Study Sample  We analyzed data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), a multisite, prospective, population-based cohort study of Hispanic or Latino adults aged 18 to 74 years living in the US. A stratified, 2-state area probability sample of household addresses was selected from 4 large US communities: San Diego, California; Chicago, Illinois; Bronx, New York; and Miami, Florida. Hispanic or Latino ethnicity was self-reported by participants and included Cuban, Central and South American, Mexican, Puerto Rican and Dominican. Participants aged 45 to 74 years were oversampled.",648b078a-d69b-4743-a947-4527aa993f79
1,methods1," Thus, sampling weights were used in the analysis to account for the unequal probability of selection. We also obtained data from the Study of Latinos–Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL–INCA), an ancillary study of the HCHS/SOL that investigated cognitive aging and impairment. Details of the HCH/SOL and SOL–INCA have been described previously.13,14  Variables  Neurocognitive tests were administered in HCH/SOL and SOL–INCA during face-to-face encounters by trained bilingual psychometrists in the participants’ preferred language. Participants in HCH/SOL underwent neurocognitive assessments between March 2008 and June 2011 (visit 1). Participants who were recruited into SOL–INCA (n = 6377) underwent neurocognitive reassessment between October 2015 and March 2018 (visit 2).",6b898a40-ed62-4766-99a7-aa053d566288
2,methods2," In the present study, we analyzed the results of 4 of these neurocognitive tests: (1) Brief Spanish-English Verbal Learning Test (B-SEVLT) Sum, which includes 3 learning trials, (2) B-SEVLT Recall, which is a delayed verbal episodic and memory trial; (3) word fluency (verbal) for speech production; and (4) Digit Symbol Substitution Test (Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)) for sustained attention, psychomotor speed, and executive function. These tests have been described previously.15  At visit 1, participants completed a 24-hour dietary recall of predefined food and nutritional categories. A second dietary recall was performed approximately 30 days later. For participants with 2 dietary recalls, dietary intake was ascertained by calculating the mean of both recalls. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet was examined using the Mediterranean diet score (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)), which has been described previously.",d432ae9f-ecce-4117-b4ad-57015b5e2c9f
3,methods3,"8 Briefly, the consumption of different Mediterranean diet score (MDS) components (fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, meat, and dairy products) was recorded and adjusted for total energy intake. Participants received 1 point for each beneficial component (fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, and fish) consumed at or above the sex-specific median, 1 point for each detrimental component (meat and dairy products) consumed below the sex-specific median, 1 point for monounsaturated to saturated fat ratio consumed above the sex-specific median, and 1 point for moderate alcohol consumption (≤2 drinks/d for men, and ≤1 drink/d for women). The mean servings for each Mediterranean diet score (MDS) component are shown in Table 1.8,16 The Mediterranean diet score (MDS) ranges from 0 to 9 points, with higher scores indicating greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet.",5f694eed-ab41-45ea-abd1-887a1c2b92d9
4,methods4," In some Hispanic or Latino populations, the intake of refined grains and potatoes, which may not be fully beneficial, may be high.17 A modified Mediterranean diet score (MDS), which replaces the total-grain group with whole grains and excludes potato products from the vegetable group, has been proposed for this population.16  Table 1.

Covariates  Sociodemographic and clinical variables were ascertained at visit 1.",6f5136c9-c3e0-4756-9b80-d951be826ee2
6,methods6," Age, sex, household income, educational level, nativity (US-born vs non–US-born), preferred language, health insurance status, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (transient ischemic attack (TIA)), and current or previous smoking status were self-reported by participants.  Blood pressure was measured with an automatic sphygmomanometer while the participant was seated. Three blood pressure measurements were obtained 1 minute apart, and the mean of these 3 values was used in this analysis. History of hypertension was defined as blood pressure higher than 140/90 mm Hg or receiving treatment for hypertension. Glycated hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and creatinine and cystatin C levels were measured on a fasting blood sample.",ce8d20cc-42db-4bd7-b915-610f0f22c5ef
7,methods7," We used the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine–cystatin C equation to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and the results were expressed in mL/min/1.73 m2. History of diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL or higher, 2-hour postload plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher, glycated hemoglobin A1c level of 6.5% or higher, or receiving treatment. Body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.  Weekly mean values of physical activity were calculated by multiplying by 7 the self-reported daily engagement in moderate or vigorous physical activity. Physical activity was considered to be at goal if the participant engaged in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week based on national recommendations.",1dddf9d9-abfc-4f88-93b1-c5734cd833c0
8,methods8,"19 We also tallied the number of coexisting medical conditions at visit 1 (hypertension, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), obesity, smoking, and physical activity not at goal) and calculated the total number of vascular risk factors.  Statistical Analysis  Based on the frequency distribution, we categorized adherence to a Mediterranean diet as follows: low (Mediterranean diet score (MDS), 0-4 points), moderate (Mediterranean diet score (MDS), 5-6 points), and high (Mediterranean diet score (MDS), 7-9 points). Descriptive statistics for each intake category were expressed using weighted means with 95% CIs for continuous variables or total numbers and weighted frequencies for categorical variables. Weighted means and SDs for the cognitive tests were used to generate z scores. A global cognition score was created by averaging the mean z scores for each neurocognitive test (B-SEVLT Sum, B-SEVLT Recall, word fluency, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)).",2d826739-19e7-44d1-8a84-b674106f00d3
9,methods9,"20 Overall significance for each cognitive test and Mediterranean diet adherence was calculated with P for trend. In pairwise comparisons, the low adherence group was used as the reference category. Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics at visit 1 were compared across the 3 adherence groups by univariate complex sample analysis of variance and χ2 tests. The association between Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and neurocognitive performance at each visit was estimated using complex sample linear regression analysis with least significant difference and adjusting for multiple comparisons.  We constructed linear regression models to estimate the crude and adjusted (per models 1, 2, and 3) cognitive performance for each test. The analytic models included variables known to alter cognition. Model 1 was adjusted by age at the time of the cognitive assessment and sex. Model 2 was adjusted by age, sex, and educational level.",79eca65d-b1aa-42d4-a62d-855ca039b6be
10,methods10," Model 3 was adjusted by differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, educational level, language preference, history of hypertension, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), current or previous smoking status, health insurance, household income, US-born, physical activity, kidney function, body mass index, and number of vascular risk factors, which had P < .05) at visit 1. The change in each cognitive score between the 2 visits was calculated as cognitive score at visit 2 minus cognitive score at visit 1, adjusted by the time elapsed between the 2 visits and the cognitive score at visit 1. Mean changes in cognitive score for the different adherence groups were compared by linear regression analysis, with the low adherence group serving as the reference group. The results were adjusted by the 3 models. Differences were considered to be significant at 2-sided P < .05.",81e85fea-1f7f-425a-9ee8-a8c6e1ea1818
11,methods11," Results were expressed as means and regression coefficients (β estimates) with corresponding 95% CIs.  Statistical analyses were performed using the Complex Samples module in SPSS, version 27 (IBM SPSS), accounting for stratification, clustering, and sampling weights. Taylor series linearization method for variance estimation and correct SE calculations was used.21 Data were analyzed from September 2021 to May 2022. ",7e0f2ec8-2d5e-40e0-a39a-440e888098e2
12,results0," Of the 6377 participants enrolled in SOL–INCA, 6321 (99.1%) had completed at least 1 dietary recall and were included in the analysis; approximately 90% of participants (n = 5718) had 2 dietary recalls. The cohort had a mean (SE) age of 56.1 (0.18) years at visit 1 and included 4077 women (57.8%) and 2244 men (42.2%). Table 1 depicts consumption of foods for the different components of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS). Mediterranean diet adherence weighted frequencies were 35.8% (n = 2112 of 6321) for the low adherence group, 45.4% (n = 2795) for the moderate adherence group, and 18.8% (n = 1414) for the high adherence group. The frequency distribution by Mediterranean diet score (MDS) category is shown in eTable 1 in the Supplement. The mean Mediterranean diet score (MDS) was 5.05 (95% CI, 6.98-5.12) points.

13,results1," Sex, history of diabetes, and total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were not statistically different between groups. Compared with participants in the low adherence group, adults in the moderate and high adherence groups were less likely to be born in the US (14.0% [n = 328] vs 5.2% [n = 166] and 4.4% [n = 62]), less likely to use English as their preferred language (21.6% [n = 466] vs 9.6% [n = 231] and 7.1% [n = 91]), and less likely to have health insurance (62.9% [n = 1339] vs 51.8% [n = 1405] and 51.7% [n = 685]). In addition, compared with the low adherence group, the high adherence group had a better cardiovascular profile, as evidenced by a lower prevalence of history of hypertension (45.8% [n = 927] vs 38.5% [n = 505]; P = .002), history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (4.5% [n = 78] vs 1.8% [n = 32]; P = .001), and current or previous smoking status (24.0% [n = 488] vs 10.8% [n = 147]; P < .",d9615635-ab2b-4b82-9500-15f258216af1

15,results18," In the model adjusted for age, sex, and educational level (model 2), the decreases in B-SEVLT Sum mean z scores were slower in the moderate vs low adherence groups (β = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.05-0.17) and in the high vs low adherence groups (β = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.10-0.25).

18,discussion0," In this cohort of diverse Hispanic or Latino adults, higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with higher global cognition scores and decreased 7-year learning and memory decline. These findings suggest that diet modification may offer another means of reducing the risk for cognitive impairment. A Mediterranean diet that is culturally tailored for a specific Hispanic or Latino heritage could offer enhanced Mediterranean diet–type benefits.  An association between Mediterranean diet adherence and cognitive performance has been shown in multiple studies. In a meta-analysis of 6 different cohorts, participants in the higher Mediterranean diet tertile had a 33% reduction in the risk of mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease compared with those in the lowest tertiles.22 In another meta-analysis including 15 cohort studies and 2 randomized clinical trials, the Mediterranean diet was associated with different cognitive outcomes, such as memory and global cognition.",730d1bad-e236-49aa-bb2d-821bb739806e
19,discussion1,"23 Because the advantage of the Mediterranean diet for cognition has been observed in individuals with different backgrounds, the benefit was suggested as transferable across populations.24 However, the few studies of the implications of the Mediterranean diet for cognitive decline among Hispanic or Latino participants have reported conflicting results. In the cross-sectional sample of the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (1269 middle-aged and older adults), each point increase in the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) was associated with a 0.14-point increase in global cognition, as defined by the Mini-Mental State Examination score.18 A subsequent study that used longitudinal data from the same cohort (n = 913) reported that higher Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with a 2-year change in memory. However, the benefits on global function and Mini-Mental State Examination scores were observed only in adults with type 2 diabetes, but not in adults without diabetes.",319979b7-f17c-416f-bc21-5c9c66144541
20,discussion2,"25 This finding suggests that Mediterranean diet adherence may be protective against age-dependent cognitive decline in a subset of Hispanic or Latino adults. In comparison, a study of the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey involving 2435 participants found an association between Mediterranean diet and increased cognition among non-Hispanic White adults but not among Hispanic or Latino adults.26  Results of the present study support that increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with enhanced cognition and decreased age-dependent cognitive decline in middle-aged and older Hispanic or Latino adults. These associations were largely derived from the results of the neurocognitive tests that assessed episodic learning and memory (B-SEVLT Sum and B-SEVLT Recall). In a cross-sectional study using visit 1 data of the HCHS/SOL, a healthier diet quality, defined by the Alternate Healthy Eating Index, was associated with better global cognition.",15ece9d6-7133-44bf-9284-7270465792ba
21,discussion3,"27 However, similar to the present study, that study observed no associations between healthy diet and word fluency or Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) score.27 It is possible that diet is particularly beneficial for neuroanatomical areas that are associated with memory. The neurocircuitry involved in episodic learning and memory relies on the extensive connections among the medial temporal lobe, hippocampus, and frontal cortex.28 Mechanistically, the Mediterranean diet was associated with larger temporal lobe and hippocampal volumes.11 Furthermore, Mediterranean diet score (MDS) was associated with preserved brain volume in mediotemporal regions and decreased β-amyloid and phosphorylated tau pathology.12 Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that a Mediterranean diet may protect the integrity of brain areas involved in memory and learning from pathologic events, such as amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation.",2f4a7b1b-a1ca-4e5e-830e-e5fa29a0946c
22,discussion4,"11,12 Alternatively, it has been proposed that the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower risk of dementia because it reduces the prevalence of vascular comorbid conditions that affect the normal functioning of the neurovascular unit.29 In the present study, we observed a lower frequency of risk factors associated with cerebrovascular diseases and neurovascular uncoupling in participants in the high adherence group. However, the results remained statistically significant after adjustment for these variables.  Several baseline characteristics, including educational level, English as the preferred language, birth in the US, and health insurance, suggest an inverse association between acculturation and Mediterranean diet adherence.",cbc3ea1c-8b7e-4a0c-bb8f-21fd4b49361b
23,discussion5," These observations are in agreement with previous studies that found the acculturative process of Hispanic or Latino populations to US society was associated with the adoption of less healthy dietary habits, which can affect the development of chronic medical conditions.30,31 Results of the present study remained significant after adjustment for individual sociodemographic variables that were significantly different between groups. However, it is possible that the interplay of social determinants of health, including education, income, and access to health insurance, is a factor in the association between diet quality and cognitive function. We are currently investigating the modulatory implication of social determinants of health for the association between Mediterranean diet adherence and cognitive decline, and we plan to publish these results.  Limitations  This study has several limitations. First, several covariates were self-reported with the possibility of recall bias.",3ab20155-717a-41f2-8321-d1e043e28778
24,discussion6," Individuals with low adherence to the Mediterranean diet were more likely to report being born in the US and a preference for using the English language, which were factors in the adoption of unhealthy nutritional behaviors in some, but not all, Hispanic or Latino adults. Although we adjusted for these factors at visit 1, longer time in the study may have hastened the adoption of new dietary and lifestyle habits that may have altered the association between Mediterranean diet that was measured only at baseline and cognitive performance 7 years later.32 Thus, long-term diet-measurement methods and extended follow-up may be necessary to identify temporal variations in dietary patterns and their associations with the development of chronic diseases.  Second, we used the original Mediterranean diet score (MDS),8 and the calculation of this score was based on the consumption of beneficial and detrimental foods above or below sex-specific medians.",3fc50d2a-e642-4999-88cb-e3e017e79c00
25,discussion7," Although easy to reproduce, the original Mediterranean diet score (MDS) assumed an outcome that was based on consumption thresholds, which may not be applicable to the diet of specific populations. For example, consumption of refined grains and potatoes is high in some Hispanic or Latino groups.17 Thus, a modified version of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) was developed for these populations.16 In a sensitivity analysis, replacing the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with the modified Mediterranean diet score (MDS) did not change the final results.  Third, we used only 4 tests (B-SEVLT Sum, B-SEVLT Recall, word fluency, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)) to assess cognitive performance. We cannot exclude the possibility that including other neurocognitive tests could yield different results.",fe8dbcae-6c3e-4867-92c1-dd16882dd7d4
26,discussion8," Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, this study analyzed the largest and most diverse cohort of middle-aged and older Hispanic or Latino individuals to understand the association of Mediterranean diet with cognition.  Conclusions  In this large, longitudinal, population-based cohort study of diverse Hispanic or Latino adults, we found that a higher level of Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with better cognitive function, specifically episodic learning and memory, and with decreased 7-year memory decline, which are 2 cognitive domains related to Alzheimer disease. A culturally tailored Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer disease among Hispanic or Latino adults. Future studies should examine whether the results prove similar across different racial and ethnic heritage.  Supplement. eTable 1.",55966d4c-ed34-425b-96a2-9720a8b69709
