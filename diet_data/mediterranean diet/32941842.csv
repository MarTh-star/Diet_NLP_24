0,methods0," Detailed information regarding the diet and androgens (DIANA)-5 study design and protocol has been previously reported [6].  Briefly, women aged 35–70 years, diagnosed with invasive BC within the previous 5 years, free from recurrences or metastases or other cancers, were eligible for the study. All the women were fully informed about the aim of the study, signed an informed consent form, and received general recommendations for the prevention of cancer (the 2007 WCRF/AICR recommendations).  At baseline, the women recruited into the study were requested:To provide copy of the clinical and pathological notes concerning their BC;  To complete a questionnaire on their medical history and major cancer risk factors, such as menstrual history and reproductive and behavioral factors (e.g.",489a4273-ebb3-45e7-8907-62465f933576

After the baseline examinations, the women at high metabolic and hormonal risk of BC recurrences (ER-negative tumors or serum testosterone level ≥ 0.4 ng/mL (1.338 nmol/mL) and/or serum insulin ≥ 7 μU/mL (50 pmol/L) and/or presence of MS) were randomized to an active dietary intervention group (IG) or to a control group (CG) that followed the baseline WCRF/AICR recommendations.",a1037d66-2682-4175-b795-249848a55436
2,methods2,"  Data collection and measurements were performed in each study center at baseline and at the end of the first, third, and fifth year, and were recorded in a central electronic database at the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan.  The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethical Committee of the coordinating center Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan for all the other collaborating Institutions (INT 37/07). Additionally, the number of the trial is NCT05019989.  2.1. Dietary Intervention  After randomization, only the women randomized into the IG were invited to attend dietary activities. The intervention consisted of cooking classes, common meals, and dietary reinforcement meetings once a month during the first year. IG women received the menus supplied during the cookery classes and recipes.",7f29525e-0dd2-41c5-a8db-5af643937d5b
3,methods3,"  The dietary intervention was based on Mediterranean diet principles and recipes and including some fermented food from Macrobiotic tradition (miso, soy sauce, tempeh, umeboshi) to facilitate digestion and serve as a reliable reservoir for microbiota [9], aimed at:Reducing caloric intake through the preferred consumption of highly satiating foods (whole grain cereals, legumes, and vegetables);  Reducing high glycemic index food (refined flours, potatoes, white rice, corn flakes) and high insulinemic foods (sugar and milk). Nuts and legume flours were proposed in sweet and savory cookery recipes. Desserts were prepared without adding sugars, but using instead nuts, fresh fruit, dates, and small amounts of dates, raisins, and dried apricots;  Reducing sources of saturated fats (red and processed meat, milk, and dairy products) and avoiding trans fatty acids (margarines and industrial snacks and pastries). Cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil was the main source of fat.",f707975e-a122-4309-b62a-3bab54139a97
4,methods4," The consumption of nuts and seeds was encouraged;  Reducing protein intake, mainly animal proteins. Among animal food, fish, especially cold-water fish (e.g., salmon and mackerel), rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, was privileged.  An example of the proposed menu is shown in Figure S1. Nutritional requirements and most menus and recipes were standardized among the study centers. A nutritionist was always present in the cooking classes and common lunches in order to ensure the necessary assistance to the cooks and to reinforce recommendations to the participants.  2.2. Dietary Data Collection  Women’s compliance to the diet and androgens (DIANA)-5 dietary recommendations was assessed through 24 h food frequency diaries. The participants had to complete the 24 h food frequency diaries at baseline, before starting the dietary intervention, and at the end of the first year (±2 months).",642b87df-58e7-493c-bb95-1e11179840bd
5,methods5,"  The 24 h food frequency diary contains a list of 65 food items, without any information on portion size or weight or recipes. The women only had to indicate whether, on the previous day, they had eaten or not eaten the specified food at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and breaks. The diary is organized into the following six groups:  Drinks (with and without alcohol, with and without added sugar), milk, and dairy products. This group includes a specific item for plant-based unsweetened beverages.  Sweets and confectionery. This group includes separate items for sugar, whole sugar, honey, and malt.  Bread and grains. This group includes separate items for refined grains, whole grains, and grain products.  Meat, fish, eggs, and meat substitutes. This group includes separate items for red and processed meat, white meat, and meat substitutes made from wheat gluten protein.  Legumes, vegetables, fresh and dried fruit, nuts, and seeds. This group includes separate items for soy products.",a444f211-1f68-4f0b-964c-d6657f7bcadd

Statistical Analysis  Among 2132 recruited BC women, 590 did not show, after the baseline examinations, a high metabolic/hormonal risk of BC recurrences and did not enter in the randomization. Sociodemographic, clinical, metabolic, and dietary characteristics of 1542 women at high risk were summarized by randomization group using mean and standard deviation (SD), and they were compared by using t tests. The frequencies of MS parameters by randomization group were compared by using χ2 test. MS was defined on the basis of the presence of at least three components out of five, according to the threshold proposed by the International Diabetic Federation (waist circumference ≥ 80 cm; systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 85 mmHg, fasting plasma glucose ≥ 100 mg/100 mL (5.6 mmol/L) or previously diagnosed type II diabetes, triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/100 mL (1.",a7a956aa-a945-4f02-a013-a79e738c8860

Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was defined as body weight/squared height (kg/m2).  Data from the 24 h food frequency diaries about the previous day’s consumption were reported as single food and food groups. On the basis of the proposed diet and androgens (DIANA)-5 dietary recommendations, we created groups of recommended or discouraged food by summing single food items that equally contribute on the basis of their frequency of consumption.",4d1c05f6-76e8-469a-b6ab-5e86d8d5b1c1
8,methods8,"  We created the following groups of recommended foods:Whole-grain products (whole bread, whole rice, other whole grain cereals, unsweetened muesli, oat flakes);  Unsweetened beverages (vegetable milk, tea, barley coffee);  Vegetables (all vegetables except potatoes);  Fruit (all kinds of fruit);  Legumes and soy products (legumes, tofu/tempeh);  Recommended animal protein products (fish, mollusks, and crustaceans);  Dried fruit (apricots, raisins, plums);  Nuts and seeds (hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts, nut creams, and oilseeds);  Vegetable oils (extra virgin olive oil, seeds oil);  Spices and seasonings (miso, tamari, spices);  We created the following groups of discouraged foods:Sugary beverages (sugary beverages, animal milk);  Alcoholic drinks (wine, beer, spirits);  Sweets and cakes (white sugar, artificial sweeteners, chocolate, candies, biscuits, ice creams, brioches);  Refined cereals (white bread, white rice, egg noodles, corn flakes,",3e210151-c96c-47b1-b643-47a07dc82724

White meat, eggs, coffee, unsweetened citrus juices, and unsweetened fruit juices were considered neutral food (not recommended but not discouraged).  We created the variable of Recommended Food Consumption/day (Recommended Food Consumption/day (RFC)) by putting together all the recommended foods (37 items) and the variable of Discouraged Food Consumption/day (Discouraged Food Consumption/day (DFC)) by putting together all the discouraged foods (23 items) as indicators of adherence to the diet and androgens (DIANA)-5 dietary recommendations.",ab4299ff-dfdf-40ef-a1bc-440151039cb6
10,methods10,"  We also created a Dietary Compliance Indicator (Dietary Compliance Indicator (DCI)) given by the ratio of Recommended Food Consumption/day (RFC) and Discouraged Food Consumption/day (DFC).  A two-sample t test was used to compare baseline and 1-year measurements in the two randomized groups.  We analyzed the magnitude of changes in anthropometric, metabolic, and dietary variables by using the difference (delta, Δ) between the 1-year and the baseline measurements for each woman in the two groups.  Changes in MS parameters (ΔMS parameters) were described according to four categories:  No change, worsening of the number of MS parameters, low improvement (reduction of 1 or 2 MS parameters), high improvement (reduction of 3 or more MS parameters).",11ecf1c3-c5e6-4463-87b1-e57ef9c9d7d8

Center, age, Body mass index (BMI) at baseline, education (years), hormonal treatment (yes/no), years from BC diagnosis, and chemotherapy (yes/no) in the past were used as model covariates.  Furthermore, a logistic regression model was used to compute the OR and 95%CI of Δbody weight (reduction above the median value, −1.19 kg) by means of the increase of ΔRecommended Food Consumption/day (RFC) (tertiles) and the reduction of ΔDiscouraged Food Consumption/day (DFC) (tertiles) within the total population and by randomization group.",e522213d-896a-4cf1-9d8c-3df4e4d13725
12,methods12,"  This analysis was repeated by combining the tertiles of ΔRecommended Food Consumption/day (RFC) and the tertiles of ΔDiscouraged Food Consumption/day (DFC) in a unique index of compliance of 9 categories (reference category of low compliance: first tertiles of ΔRecommended Food Consumption/day (RFC) and first tertiles of ΔDiscouraged Food Consumption/day (DFC)). Center, age, weight at baseline, education (years), hormonal treatment (yes/no), years from BC diagnosis, and chemotherapy in the past (yes/no) were used as model covariates.  A p-value of <0.05 was taken as significant. All statistical tests were two-sided. Analyses were completed using the STATA 14 statistical package.  3. Results  Among the 1542 women at high risk, 769 (mean age 52.0 ± 8.5 SD) were randomized into the IG and 773 (mean age 51.7 ± 8.3 SD) into the CG.

Baseline Metabolic and Anthropometric Characteristics of the Study Population by Randomization Group  Table 1 reports the baseline clinical, metabolic, and anthropometric characteristics of the study population by randomization group. There were no significant differences between the study groups about clinical, sociodemographic, and metabolic variables, but each metabolic parameter was slightly less favorable in the IG so that the prevalence of MS was somewhat higher (40.1% vs. 35.2%, p = 0.05).  3.2.

The IG and the CG were also homogenous for Recommended Food Consumption/day (RFC)/day, Discouraged Food Consumption/day (DFC)/day, and Dietary Compliance Indicator (DCI).  After the randomization, 45 women relapsed in the first year; 21 changed their minds, thus dropping out of the study without any dietary intervention; 133 women, for familiar/work reasons, did not participate in the 1-year follow-up examinations.  Therefore, 1344 women (87.1%) participated in the first year clinical follow-up visit (689 in the IG and 655 in the CG).  3.3.

15,methods15," Both groups significantly improved the consumption of almost all recommended foods and reduced the discouraged foods, but the women in the IG showed greater changes.  IG improved the consumption of the recommended foods, i.e whole grain products (p < 0.001), unsweetened beverages (p < 0.001), legumes (p < 0.001), vegetables (p = 0.01), dried fruits (p < 0.001), nuts and seeds (p < 0.001), recommended spices (p < 0.001), and in general improved the Recommended Food Consumption/day (RFC) more than the CG.

21,methods21," Discussion  The findings from this large Italian randomized controlled trial suggest that a dietary intervention based on the Mediterranean diet and on macrobiotic dietary principles is effective in reducing body weight and MS parameters in BC women at high metabolic/hormonal risk of BC recurrences. The women randomized in the IG showed greater improvements in their anthropometric and metabolic characteristics compared to CG. These changes were significantly associated with increased adherence to the diet and androgens (DIANA)-5 dietary recommendations.  Although observational evidence suggested that some foods (red and processed meat) and nutrients (saturated fatty acids) are potential risk factors for BC, given their effect on insulin resistance and inflammation markers, obesity and alcohol consumption are the only factors that were consistently found to be associated with BC incidence, and obesity was also found to be associated with BC recurrences and BC mortality.",495810f0-ad26-4b88-b593-f3178bcd0399
22,methods22," The two largest trials about BC women, the Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study (Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS)) and the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living (Women’s Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL)), designed their dietary intervention mainly to lower participants’ fat intake from 30% to 20% of total calories [11,12]. Additionally, in the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) trial, participants were requested to increase their vegetable and fruits servings in order to improve fiber intake. However, body weight only significantly decreased in the Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS) study, and subsequently, the authors observed a reduction in BC recurrences.",a1e2fce2-0114-4682-a034-5fe213fd820b
23,methods23,"  The diet and androgens (DIANA)-5 dietary intervention consisted of a comprehensive qualitative dietary change, with a moderate calorie restriction obtained by encouraging the consumption of highly satiating food (unrefined cereals, legumes, and vegetables) and by avoiding the consumption of calorie-dense processed food, sweets, and sugary drinks. Furthermore, the women were invited to limit the consumption of red and processed meat (high in saturated fats) and to prefer extra-virgin olive oil, nuts, and oleaginous seeds as a source of unrefined vegetable fats. In our study, the women belonging to the IG significantly increased their adherence to the proposed diet and androgens (DIANA)-5 dietary recommendations and lost 2.5 kg on average and 2.6 cm in their waist, a difference of the same order as the one obtained in the Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS) study [11].",8d1cfac1-659a-411e-8803-828459b99491
24,methods24," In detail, the IG women with the higher increase of the recommended food consumption (ΔRecommended Food Consumption/day (RFC)) and the higher reduction of the discouraged food consumption (ΔDiscouraged Food Consumption/day (DFC)) obtained the greater improvement in their body weight.  The women in the IG also showed, after 1 year of dietary intervention, an improvement in their metabolic parameters and a reduction of the number of MS factors, particularly in the women who increased the ΔRecommended Food Consumption/day (RFC) and reduced ΔDiscouraged Food Consumption/day (DFC).  Furthermore, our results found a major impact of ΔDiscouraged Food Consumption/day (DFC) on MS parameters, which suggests that increasing recommended foods is not sufficient to improve metabolic markers if discouraged foods are not decreased as well.  MS increases BC relapses [5,7].",78fc7c11-e88e-49fb-b1b4-935cfd4b1eec
25,methods25," The mechanisms by which MS affects prognosis are likely to include higher sex hormone levels, higher levels of insulin and IGF-I, and chronic inflammatory status [5,13,14,15,16]. The women in the IG obtained an MS regression of about 25%. Compared to other trials of the Mediterranean diet and MS [17,18,19,20], we observed a lower MS regression after 1 year of dietary intervention. However, in the present study, we did not work with “healthy” dysmetabolic people. BC women suffer from special issues and problems, such as treatment-related adverse effects, fatigue, and depression, which can complicate weight management and the control of metabolic and hormonal parameters. In detail, premature menopause is a consequence of chemotherapy and/or hormonal treatment, and it is accompanied by physiologic changes that can affect energy balance, with a consequent increase in abdominal fat, reduction in lean mass, and worsening of MS parameters [21].",b6931737-4e68-42d0-a0c0-a60f80452ebe
26,methods26," In our study, we did not find any significant interaction with hormonal treatments. Overall, our dietary intervention seemed to be more effective in the reduction of body weight, waist circumference, and triglycerides, while it obtained only minor changes in blood pressure, glycemia, and HDL cholesterol. Higher adherence to the diet and androgens (DIANA)-5 recommendations was helpful for the management of weight and for the control of MS parameters in BC women. Interestingly, the results obtained by combining the two indices of dietary adherence also suggested a protective effect for the intermediate categories of dietary change. In particular, the reduction of the Discouraged Food Consumption/day (DFC) seemed to be more important for the control of body weight and MS parameters than for the increase of the recommended ones.  The major strength of the present study is the large sample size.",07bf0696-ebaf-46ea-a65e-c3531a4fc12b
27,methods27," Furthermore, the diet and androgens (DIANA)-5 is the only randomized controlled trial that will likely be able to test whether a Mediterranean and macrobiotic dietary intervention may improve BC survival.  One limitation is that women from the CG showed some improvements in the metabolic and anthropometric parameters of interest. These changes were partially expected by design. In fact, all women, on the day they were recruited, attended a conference in which the 2007 WCRF/AICR lifestyle recommendations for cancer prevention were explained and received a standard breakfast that respects WCRF principles [1]. These recommendations and the specific interest of BC women in the benefits of a healthy diet led the CG to make some adjustments in their dietary habits.  A further limitation is that, although the IG received notes on the nutritional content of the menus and recipes, we did not use any dietary instruments to estimate the women’s nutrient intake.",6ea9d4c2-3530-4cdd-8dfd-f1f83863ea45
28,methods28," However, the 24 h food frequency diaries are extremely efficient to describe and compare the average consumption of specific foods and dietary patterns between populations, in line with our aim [22].  5. Conclusions  These results after the 1-year dietary intervention are encouraging. The follow-up of the cohort and the subsequent survival analysis will allow a better understanding of whether the obtained weight reduction and metabolic changes may affect the progression of the disease.
