0,methods0,"4.1. Animals Nulliparous nonpregnant BALB/c mice of 9-week-old (Harlan Laboratories, S. Pietro al Natisone, Udine, Italy) were maintained in Plexiglas cages under standardized conditions. The animal body weight range was 19–21 g. All efforts were made to minimize and reduce animal suffering and for limiting the number of animals used. The animal experiments were carried out following the procedure described by the guidelines of the European Community Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC). The animal care and experimental protocols were performed according to the Italian Approved Animal Welfare Assurance. The approval protocol number was DR 33/2011-B, released by “Ministrero del Lavoro, della Salute e delle Politiche Sociali” (Rome, Italy) in 3 March 2011. Mice consumed diet deprived of polyphenols (Mucedola, S. Pietro al Natisone, Milan) and water ad libitum for 7 days to allow the acclimatisation.   4.2.",458c4a79-8683-42d0-9048-a100e1dbcf96
1,methods1," Experimental Design The experimental procedure was synthesized in Scheme 1. To test the effects of HT (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Harbor, MI, USA, 320 mM in ethanol stock solution) the following experiment was performed: 40 animals were divided in 5 experimental groups: group 1 (control, n = 8), group 2 (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), n = 8), group 3 (HT 40 mg/kg b.w., n = 8), group 4 (HT 80 mg/kg b.w., n = 8), group 5 (HT 80 mg/kg b.w. administrated for 5 times, n = 8). The sample size was determined fixing a level of significance of 5% and a power of study of 90% and considering as variance and expected difference results previously obtained by in vitro studies. After acclimatisation, animals fed diet without polyphenols for 3 days during which only the group 5 received daily HT 80 mg/kg b.w. by oral gavage. After these 3 days, all animals were kept fast (time 72 h) for the whole period of the trial during which they were treated with HT by gavage.",a71e4fab-cc70-4b3e-9243-0fad9e9a3ad3
2,methods2," Two administrations were carried out (after 8 h and 24 h from start of fasting) with vehicle (ethanol 6%) in animals of group 1 and 2, with HT (40 mg/kg b.w.) group 3 and HT (80 mg/kg b.w.) groups 4 and 5. 1 h after the last gavage all animals received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (50 µg/mouse) except the group 1 that received saline solution. Finally, 2 h after i.p. all animals were sacrificed.   4.3. Animals Sacrifice Two hours later the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment mice were anesthetized with Pentothal injection (200 µL/mouse, 6 mg/mL) and blood was collected by intra-cardiac puncture with heparinized syringes. The blood obtained was divided into two aliquots: 100 µL were sampled in RNA protect Animal Blood Tubes containing a solution that immediately stabilizes cellular RNA (QiagenS.r.l. Milan, Italy) and stored at −20 °C until the analysis of COX2 gene expression. The remaining aliquot was centrifuged at 4000 rpm × 15 min.",beef81d1-4dff-4a16-826e-768b6e08a02a
3,methods3," The resulting plasma was stored at 4 °C and used to determine the TNF-α cytokine level and the total antioxidant power, while the cell pellets were resuspended in 500 µL of RPMI medium and immediately used for the assessment of DNA damage.  4.4. COX2 mRNA Analysis by Real-Time PCR Total RNA was extracted from blood cells using a dedicated kit (Qiagen, RNeasy Protect Animal Blood Kit) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and the purity was determined by the A260/A280 ratio. Samples were stored at −80 °C before use. For cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Qiagen, Quantitec Reverse Trascription kit) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was stored at −20 °C prior to real-time PCR.",a6d6ea39-e576-467f-abbc-7e1d7a90c7e2
4,methods4," Gene expression was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) using a Stratagene Mx3000P Q-PCR machine (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA, USA) starting from aliquots of 2 µL of cDNA. Reactions were performed in triplicate using Quantitec SYBR Green PCR Kit (QiagenS.r.l. Milan, Italy) and Quantitect primer assay specific for COX2 and β-actin, used as internal control, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each PCR run, a negative control was systematically added, in which RNase-free water replaced cDNA. In addition, a single peak was observed for each of the products by melting curve analysis, performed routinely in all samples after amplification. No product was detected in the absence of RT in any assay for any of the products, thus indicating that there was no genomic contamination. The relative quantities of target gene mRNA were measured by following a ΔΔCt method employing an amplification plot (fluorescence signal vs. cycle number).",d047e7f5-ea6c-4adf-89b0-568f67a299b0
5,methods5," ΔCtwas calculated subtracting the average Ct value of β-actin to the average Ct value of COX2 gene for each sample. ΔΔCt is the difference between the ΔCt for each sample and the ΔCt of vehicle-treated cells as control. The results were reported as fold of change to calibrator (group 1 = control) sets equal to 1.  4.5. TNF-α Cytokine Determination TNF-α was analysed in the plasma of mice using a commercially available ELISA kit (Quantikine ELISA mouse TNF-α Immunoassay by R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. TNF-α was determined from a standard curve. The concentrations were expressed as picograms per milliliter and all assays were performed in duplicate which were averaged for statistical comparisons.  4.6. DNA Damage Assessment  The DNA damage was determined in blood cells of mice immediately after sacrifice by the single cell gel electrophoresis assay (SCGE or comet assay) as previously described [64].",8adbbb0d-8d68-439d-842e-4bc1a2b7424d
6,methods6," 10 µL of cell pellet resuspended in RPMI were transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, mixed with 75 µL of low melting agarose [0.7% in phosphate buffer (PBS)] and distributed onto conventional microscopic slides precoated with normal melting agarose (0.5% in PBS) and dried at 50 °C. After the agarose was solidified (4 °C for 5 min), a second layer of low melting agarose was applied similarly to the previous. The slides were then immersed in the lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM TrisHCl pH 10.0, containing freshly added 1% Triton X100 and 10% DMSO) for 1 h at 4 °C and then placed into a horizontal electrophoresis apparatus filled with freshly made buffer (1 mM Na2EDTA. 300 mM NaOH, pH 13.0). After 20 min of preincubation (unwinding of DNA), the electrophoresis was run for 20 min at a fixed voltage of 25 V and 300 mA, which was adjusted by raising or lowering the level of the electrophoresis buffer in the tank.",c7b01576-2439-4064-9935-6e2f2fb1939b
7,methods7," At the end of the electrophoresis, the slides were washed 3 times with the neutralization buffer (Tris-HCl 0.4 M, pH 7.5), stained with 50 mL ethidium bromide (20 mg/mL), and kept in a moisture chamber in the dark at 4 °C until analysis. All the above reported steps were carried out under red light to prevent any additional DNA damage.   4.7. Comet Detection  The cells were analyzed 24 h after staining at 400× magnification using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a 50-W mercury lamp. The microscopic images revealed circular shapes (undamaged DNA) and “comet-like” shapes in which the DNA had migrated from the head to form a tail (damaged DNA). The extension of each comet was analyzed by a computerized image analysis system (Comet assay II, Perceptive Instruments, Suffolk, UK) that, among several other parameters, gave the “tail moment” that is considered to be the parameter most directly related to DNA damage.",cafa74d2-6112-4c2a-a16c-b1df33bdfa37
8,methods8," In fact, the tail moment is defined as the product of DNA in the tail and the mean distance of its migration in the tail. Calculation of the extent of DNA damage, which was not homogeneous, was based on the analysis of 100 randomly selected comets from each slide, divided into 5 classes according to the tail moment (t.m.) values as follows: class 0 (t.m. < 1; no damage), class 1 (t.m. 1–5; slightly damaged), class 2 (t.m. 5–10; medium damage), class 3 (t.m. 10–20; highly damaged) class 4 (t.m. > 20; completely damaged). The overall score expressed in arbitrary units (A.U.) for each slide ranged from 0 (100% of the comets in class 0) to 400 (100% of the comets in class 4) [65].  4.8. Antioxidant Plasma Power Quantification  Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP)) test was used to quantify the antioxidant ability of plasma in mice. This method is based on the measure of the reducing power of plasma.",80ba4bf0-2459-468f-a6c8-4104eeb022fc
9,methods9," Antioxidants compounds can donate electrons, reducing ferric ion (Fe3+) to ferrous ion (Fe2+) at low pH. The 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine (tripyridyl s triazine (TPTZ)) in the reaction medium can bind the ferrous ion at low pH. An intense blue colour is developed with an absorption maximum at 593 nm: Fe(tripyridyl s triazine (TPTZ))3+→Fe(tripyridyl s triazine (TPTZ))2+(1)    The colour intensity is a measurement of the ferric reducing ability of plasma and, therefore, of its antioxidant capacity. The reagent concentrations were as follows: acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6), tripyridyl s triazine (TPTZ) (10 mM in HCl 40 mM), FeCl3·6H2O (20 mM) [66]. Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) reagent was prepared by mixing: 10 volumes of acetate buffer, 1 volume of tripyridyl s triazine (TPTZ), and 1 volume of FeCl3·6H2O. Plasma samples were not diluted.",d336558c-fbbc-4a6f-8174-15d2549b635b
10,methods10," In the reaction, 3 mL of Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) reagent, 100 µL of sample, and 300 µL of deionized water were mixed in a cuvette. This cuvette was shaken and the absorbance recorded for 8 min at 593 nm. The measurements of absorbance were performed in triplicate. A calibration curve was constructed with aqueous solutions of known Fe2+ concentrations (0, 100, 300, 500, 750, and 1000 µmol/L FeSO4 7H2O). Results are expressed as micromoles per liter of Fe2+.  4.9. Statistical Analysis To compare different treatments, each other a one-way ANOVA using the GraphPad Prism statistical software program Version 3.0 for Windows (San Diego, CA, USA) was applied. When a significant effect was detected (p < 0.05), the mean values were compared using Tukey’s post hoc comparisons. All data are presented as mean ± SD.  5.",28c05314-6932-43de-9c52-36013da05f45
11,methods11," Conclusions In conclusion, our results indicate that HT exerts beneficial preventive effects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced systemic inflammation and oxidative damage. The anti-inflammatory properties of this olive oil phenol are mediated by a regulation of several pathways involved in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and cytokines production, while the anti-oxidant activities are demonstrated by its ability to both prevent oxidative DNA damage and improve total antioxidant power of plasma. Further studies would be need to evaluate if the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of HT are related with the regulation of Nrf2 and NF-kB important transcription factors for genes implicated in oxidative stress and inflammation [67] as observed in other studies [46,68].",5d312814-4d09-4009-b2d5-3529dd04a364
12,methods12,"  Finally, our data encourage further clinical trials to test the use of this molecule, alone and in combination with either the current anti-inflammatory drugs or other polyphenols, in humans for the treatment and/or prevention of various chronic degenerative diseases where inflammation and oxidative stress play an important role. Once the data of the clinical interventions have shown positive results, the HT can be used in the prevention and treatment of important diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gastritis, hepatitis, peritonitis and inflammatory bowel diseases.
