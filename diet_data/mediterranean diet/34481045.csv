18,results1,"  Main results from the experimental studies  The nutritional interventions evaluated for chronic non cancer pain (CNCP) in the studies included the administration of nutritional supplements, dietary modification, and incorporation of food.  Administration of nutritional supplements  Regarding the studies carried out on pain caused by chronic pancreatitis, Abbasnezhad et al. (11) reported a significant improvement in pain during 6 months with the administration of 50,000 IU of vitamin D (p < 0.007). In addition, Singh et al. (12) described a significant reduction in the number of days with pain caused by chronic pancreatitis (p < 0.05) and a significant decrease in the intensity of the pain (p = 0.001) evaluated with the visual analog scale (visual analog scale (VAS)) after 3 months under treatment with an antioxidant compound of 600 μg of selenium, 0.54 g of vitamin C, 9,000 IU of beta carotene, 270 IU of vitamin E, and 2 g of methionine.  Regarding chronic back pain, Dunn-Lewis et al.",b3c71d71-982b-4213-ad46-891a5e088439
19,results2," (13) found a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the intensity of back pain measured with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System–57 (PROMIS-57) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)) instruments in men after supplementing the diet for 63 days with a multi-nutrient complex containing 0.25 mg of vitamin B12, 6 mg of vitamin B6, 0.40 mg of folic acid, 20 mg of pantothenic acid, 500 mg of taurine, 2,000 mg of leucine, 500 mg of isoleucine, 500 mg of valine, and 50 mg of green tea per supplement unit. However, no change in the intensity of pain was detected in women. Shell et al. (14) found a decrease in back pain intensity measured with the Roland Morris and Oswestry Disability Scales after 28 days of intervention with the combined administration of theramine (710 mg/day) and ibuprofen (p < 0.05).  Concerning patients with CP due to rheumatoid arthritis, Ghavipour et al.",65b5506b-5fd6-4a0e-9ed5-1ab94f28c442
20,results3," (15) supplemented the diet of the participants with two daily capsules of POMx (250 mg/day with a concentration of 40% ellagic acid) for 8 weeks and observed a significant reduction in rheumatoid arthritis pain perception measured with disease activity score-28 (DAS28; p < 0.001) and a decrease in the number of tender joints (p = 0.001) that also reduced pain intensity (p = 0.003). Helli et al. (16) observed that when 200 mg/day of sesamin was administered for 6 weeks, the number of tender joints and the intensity of pain evaluated with DAS28 and visual analog scale (VAS) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05 for both of them).  In the case of pain caused by osteoarthritis, Fukumitsu et al. (17) performed an intervention with maslinic acid with a dose of 50 mg/day for 12 weeks and found no significant difference in pain intensity measured with visual analog scale (VAS) when compared with the placebo group. However, Malek et al.",a6dedbf5-d859-4cdb-958b-8e2c8aa955d3

Analogously, Rondanelli et al. (19) found that the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)) score in the group that had consumed chondroitin sulfate for 12 weeks at a dose of 600 mg/day had decreased significantly by 8.70 points, compared to the placebo group (p = 0.001).  On the other hand, Cordero et al. (20) evaluated pain in patients with fibromyalgia using Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)). After the administration of 300 mg/day of CoQ10 for 70 days, they found a significant reduction in pain intensity (p < 0.01) and a significantly lower number of tender joints (p < 0.01) in comparison with the placebo.",908fcce9-09a7-4da2-8a5a-c35449169221
22,results5," Furthermore, Sawaddiruk et al.

Regarding dysmenorrhea, Santanam et al. (22) found a significant decrease in the number of painful days of the menstrual cycle in the group of participants who had ingested 1,200 IU of vitamin E and 1,000 mg of vitamin C for 8 weeks (p < 0.05). After the antioxidant intervention, chronic pelvic pain was decreased in 43% of the patients, and dysmenorrhea was descended in 37%.  For their part, Zamani et al.

Dietary modification  In other research studies, diet intervention is accompanied by physical exercise. Messier et al. (24) carried out an intervention with a hypocaloric diet (low in fat and high in vegetables) combined with 1 h per day of physical training for 3 days a week, alternating aerobic and strength exercises in patients with osteoarthritis. The results showed that the compressive strength in the knee was decreased by 5% in the group that only did physical exercise (E), 10% in the group where only the diet was modified (D), and 9% in the diet group accompanied by physical exercise (D + E) at 18 months. However, in the D + E group, a greater decrease in pain was found, according to Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), at 18 months when compared to E (p = 0.004) and D (p = 0.001).",abbfd8d9-19ca-4b72-927b-d342279de095
24,results7,"  Incorporation of food  The addition of foods, such as mussels, chamomile tea, blueberry or cherry juice, green tea, and strawberries, has been studied to evaluate the reduction of osteoarticular pain.  With respect to rheumatoid arthritis, Lindqvist et al. (25) observed that the group that consumed 75 g/day of mussels showed a lower intensity of perceived pain measured with DAS28 (p = 0.017). However, this difference was not observed when compared with the group that consumed meat (p = 0.200). Likewise, no statistically significant difference was obtained when comparing the number of tender joints and the assessment of pain intensity using the visual analog scale (VAS) tool when comparing the intervention group with the control group (p = 0.48). For their part, Pirouzpanah et al. (26) analyzed the effect of chamomile tea (6 g/day) on rheumatoid arthritis. The number of tender joints was decreased significantly (p < 0.",ba37a477-c6fc-46cc-a276-d814806b2909
25,results8,"001), although this change was not observed in the score measured by DAS28, the number of swollen joints, or the perception of pain. Regarding the consumption of blueberry juice (500 ml/day) at 90 days, Thimóteo et al. (27) stated that there was a significant reduction (p = 0.048) in the perception of pain when compared with the control group measured with the DAS28 instrument.  For osteoarthritis, Schumacher et al. (28) observed a significant improvement in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score at 13 weeks in the group that consumed 470 ml/day of cherry juice (p = 0.002) when compared with the placebo group. The same relationship was observed by Hashempur et al. (29) in all the variables analyzed (knee pain, functional capacity, and joint stiffness) that included the visual analog scale (VAS) score (p = 0.038) in the group that consumed green tea (1,500 ml/day) during 30 days.",47607364-0ce7-4b55-a7c0-892ab3b8f4a3
26,results9," In the control group, pain intensity only significantly descended when measured with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) but not when measured with visual analog scale (VAS).  Regarding knee pain, Schell et al. (30) described that in the group that consumed 50 g/day of strawberries, the intensity of pain was significantly lower at 12 weeks (p < 0.05) for both constant pain and intermittent pain, measured with the Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP)), although there were no differences in visual analog scale (VAS) for pain at the end of the 26 weeks of intervention.  Main results of observational studies  Nutritional aspects, such as the type of diet or some supplements, have been evaluated from observational studies for their plausible relation to pain. Concerning diet modification studies, Di Lorenzo et al.",61c4a77d-7c90-492a-a09b-47ec661c78e7
27,results10," (31) observed that the number of days with headache was decreased in the two groups that followed hypocaloric or ketogenic diet (p < 0.0001). However, this improvement had occurred earlier in the group with a hypocaloric diet, from the second month, while in the group with a ketogenic diet, it had occurred from the sixth month. On the other hand, other clinical variables, such as frequency of headache attacks or consumption of drugs for headaches, were decreased equally in the two groups from the sixth month (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, Veronese et al. (32) found that patients who had greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet had better scores in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) (p < 0.0001) and less general pain evaluated by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) (p < 0.05).  Regarding the observational studies about nutritional supplements, Shmagel et al.",60fe8566-b868-4410-9661-98d7b93018cc
28,results11," (33) focused on knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis and observed that a lower intake of magnesium in the diet was associated with worse scores on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) than those with higher magnesium intake (p < 0.001). Likewise, they found a relationship between people who had low magnesium intakes in their diet and greater intensity of knee pain due to osteoarthritis at 48 months of follow-up. However, Lourdudoss et al. (34) did not find a statistically significant association between the consumption of omega 3 fatty acids within the diet and pain due to rheumatoid arthritis nor did they found an association between supplementation with omega 3, omega 6, and the omega 6:omega 3 ratios with DAS28 scores.

29,discussion0," The aim of this study was to review the scientific literature on the impact of the use of nutritional strategies among people with chronic non cancer pain (CNCP). We found that most of the interventions with nutritional supplements collected in our study show improvement and relief in CP (11, 13, 20, 21). This is also the case when it is modified to a hypocaloric, Mediterranean, or with a healthier profile diet (24, 31, 32). However, the use of stand-alone foods, such as fruit juices, yields few hopeful results (26, 30).  We found a few studies whose intervention was the modification of the diet, and it was easier to find studies whose intervention was by using a capsule or pill. This could be due to the ease of applicability of the second one, while the modification in diet requires more effort both in patients and researchers.",d46dd50d-ef4a-48da-a3a9-3e71a10fae87
30,discussion1," That is why we understand the nutritional education of special relevance in these patients, highlighting above all the main difficulties they may go through, such as lack of knowledge, lack of interest, or rigidity in the face of change (35).  The use of nutritional interventions to relieve pain in clinical practice has numerous benefits, such as fewer adverse effects than drugs, being more economical methods, or increasing patient autonomy (7, 8, 36).  We observe that the intervention that offers the best results is diet modification. This is also confirmed by Brain et al. (8), Clinton et al. (37), and Kaartinen et al. (38). However, this modification has to be easy to wear, durable, and adapted to the patient to obtain the best results (35).  Brain et al. (8) included four types of interventions in their review, which were dietary modifications, nutrient intake modifications, use of nutritional supplements, and use of fasting.",785213af-1163-4550-b413-22d6724c8cb5
31,discussion2," Comparing our systematic review with that carried out by Brain et al. (8), we found that their team did not include observational studies and interventions that were to add a specific food. In addition, they included non-RCTs, so we could find some bias. On the other hand, if we compare it with Ahmed Ali et al. (39), they conducted a systematic review that specifically focused on clinical trials on chronic pancreatitis, while our team has addressed a broader field.  The main limitation that we found in our study was that there are still a few studies on the relationship between nutrition and pain, maybe because it is a new topic (36). When comparing the 24 documents included in this review, the heterogeneity between them was revealed, which particularly affects the methodology and design of the intervention. It is for this reason that we could not do a meta-analysis.",74e6a085-fff5-4e2e-9fad-b09e0240f2e9
32,discussion3," An effort is needed to carry out future research on this topic using validated instruments to assess non-cancer CP and the nutritional variables, with deep described homogeneous interventions on large and well-characterized patient samples.  Conclusion  The results obtained show that there are nutritional interventions, especially diet modification, that can improve and alleviate chronic non cancer pain (CNCP). Furthermore, there is a need for future research to study CP as an independent entity and not as a symptom of the disease. If the evidence is strong, interventions could be applied in a clinical setting to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from this problem.
