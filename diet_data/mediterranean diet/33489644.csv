0,methods0," Scoping reviews are used to determine the scope of emerging evidence and examine the volume and focus of literature on a given topic [30]. As such, the theoretical uses of a scoping review met our aims in a research field which was theorized by authors to be limited in quantity and would be heterogeneous in terms of dietary patterns approaches examined. This scoping review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis—Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) [31].  2.1. Eligibility Criteria  Studies included in this scoping review were peer-reviewed original research studies, published in English from inception to the date of the final literature search (10 September 2021) and available in full text format. Eligible studies examined associations between dietary patterns and malnutrition and/or low muscle mass and/or sarcopenia in adults with any cancer diagnosis.",d3fb7a52-5820-4b03-ae6c-f0dc07264d76
1,methods1," Dietary patterns, including those assessed using data-driven, hypothesis-oriented or hybrid approaches, were the primary exposures of interest. Due to the anticipated limited quantity of literature using traditional dietary pattern approaches, studies were included if they examined ‘non-traditional’ dietary patterns approaches (i.e., adherence was not assessed by an overall dietary pattern score), provided the authors adequately described both the foods consumed and the methods used to assess adherence to the dietary pattern. Outcomes of interest were: (i) presence of malnutrition, assessed using validated measures (i.e., not use of albumin biomarkers); (ii) objectively assessed low muscle mass and; (iii) objectively assessed sarcopenia, including the phenotypic components of muscle strength and physical performance. Excluded were studies which did not meet the aims of this scoping review and reported on individual nutrients, foods, or supplements.  2.2. Search Strategy  2.2.1.",40ca415c-c8d4-43f1-b95d-dfb9aeb403ad
2,methods2," Information Sources  A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE Complete, Embase and CINAHL Complete databases on 10 September 2021. For completeness, the reference lists of included studies were hand-searched by one author (A.R.C.) to identify studies not discovered during the original literature search. The search strategy was developed and refined through discussion between authors and in collaboration with an experienced health science librarian to ensure an appropriate and robust search of the literature.  2.2.2. Literature Search  The literature search was confined to study titles and abstracts. Key search terms included ‘cancer’, ‘diet’, ‘malnutrition’, ‘muscle mass’, ‘sarcopenia’, ‘muscle strength’ and ‘physical function’ and synonyms of the same. Medical subject headings were additionally searched for each term. The MEDLINE Complete search strategy, including medical subject headings and applied limiters is available in Table A1 (Appendix A).  2.2.3.",b2fc01b7-20ea-4b52-bd3b-1d0ca96fa281
3,methods3," Selection of Sources of Evidence  Two authors (A.R.C. and L.E.M.) independently screened studies against the eligibility criteria in two stages. Firstly, the title and abstract of identified studies were scrutinized; any disagreements in eligibility were resolved through discussion by the same authors. Secondly, full text versions of relevant studies were sourced and screened independently against the eligibility criteria. When required, consensus was reached through discussion between authors and in the case of disagreement or uncertainty a third and fourth author (K.M.L. and N.K.) were consulted.  2.3. Data Charting Process  A data extraction chart was developed by one author (A.R.C.) and adapted using feedback from two other authors (K.M.L. and N.K.). Data charting was conducted for eligible studies in Microsoft Excel by one author (A.R.C.) and verified for accuracy and clarity by two authors (L.E.M. and N.K.).",9d434b2b-b560-4d49-bb9e-ce39ccd58d74

Synthesis of Results  A narrative synthesis was conducted to summarise the major findings from the included studies. Results were presented by grouping individual studies based on their dietary patterns approach, including data-driven, hypothesis-orientated, and dietary patterns assessed using ‘non-traditional’ approaches, an approach used in previous reviews of dietary patterns research to present results [32]. This approach allowed each study to be adequately presented and summarised, knowledge gaps to be highlighted, and opportunities for future research to be identified [31].  3.",354e5732-b41b-4f46-a076-7d4198a17c90
5,methods5," Results  In total 3341 potentially relevant studies were identified from the three selected databases. Of these, 851 were duplicates, yielding 2490 studies to be screened. After review of titles and abstracts, 2411 studies did not meet the eligibility criteria and were excluded. Full text versions of the remaining 79 studies were screened, and a further 72 studies were excluded. Seven eligible studies were identified for data charting and review. Figure 1 presents the PRISMA flow diagram, outlining the study selection process.  3.1. Study Characteristics  The seven included studies were published between 2018 and 2021. Study designs included two randomised controlled trials [33,34], three non-randomised controlled trials [35,36,37] and two observational cross-sectional studies [38,39]. The number of participants ranged from 23 to 285, including adults aged between 52 to 74 years.",301f1ee8-eae9-4adb-8361-e7bd81bfdbd9
6,methods6," People with prostate, ovarian, endometrial, bladder, breast, and upper and lower gastrointestinal cancers were included. One study included treatment naive participants [38], two studies included people undergoing radiotherapy [35,37], one study included people during rehabilitation [36] and three studies included people who were diagnosed or treated between 2 to over 5 years prior to assessment [33,34,39].  3.2. Nutrition and Muscle-Related Outcomes Measured  All included studies reported on measures of muscle mass, lean mass or muscle cross-sectional area. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)) was used for estimation of changes in fat-free mass (kg) [35,37] and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) was used for estimation of changes in total body lean mass (kg) [33,34].",1daf7547-7e16-4e2f-84d2-7a3154cdab8e
7,methods7," Changes in skeletal muscle mass (kg) were also estimated using measures derived from both Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) [35,36,37]. Computed tomography (CT) was used to derive a skeletal muscle index (SMI; skeletal muscle area [cm2] divided by height squared [m2]) at the third lumbar vertebrae (L3) [38,39]. Where CT were used, Hounsfield Unit (HU) thresholds for segmentation of skeletal muscle tissue cross-sectional area ranged from −29 to 150 HU with low muscle mass defined according to sex-specific SMI cut-offs of ≤52.4 cm2/m2 for men and ≤38.5 cm2/m2 for women [39] or <43 cm2/m2 for men if BMI < 25 kg/m2 or <53 cm2/m2 if BMI > 25 kg/m2 and <41 cm2/m2 for women [38]. No studies assessed malnutrition or sarcopenia as outcomes.  3.3.",af2dc33c-fae6-4835-98a3-78c2cc230a64
8,methods8," Dietary Intake Assessments  Dietary intake was assessed via food frequency questionnaire (FFQ; Portuguese-specific semi-quantitative questionnaire and Diet History Questionnaire II) [38,39], food diaries [34,35,36,37] or one-month diet history (Wollongong Dietary Inventory) [33].  3.4. Dietary Patterns Methods  Dietary pattern approaches were heterogeneous across the seven studies. One study used data-driven methods, where principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) was conducted [38]. Two studies used hypothesis-orientated methods to assess diet-quality, namely the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener and Healthy Eating Index 2010 [33,39]. Four studies examined ‘non-traditional’ dietary patterns, namely measuring adherence to the ketogenic diet and ‘low carb’ diets via food diaries and biological samples [34,35,36,37]. Characteristics of the seven studies, including key findings, are reported in Table 1.  3.5.",18e4e1e4-1c74-40ab-b86b-94dbbbed66a4
9,methods9," Data-Driven Dietary Patterns  One cross-sectional study used principal component analysis (PCA) to derive dietary patterns and determine their association with the odds of having low muscle mass (derived from SMI) [38]. Four major dietary patterns were identified from semi-quantitative FFQ including: (i) high-fat dairy products, fried snacks, and processed meat diet; (ii) legumes, vegetables and fruit diet; (iii) fat and fish diet; and (iv) alcohol, cereal and animal protein diet. Overall, 32% of participants had low muscle mass. The participants in the second and third tertiles of adherence to the ‘fat and fish’ diet (summarised in Table 2) had significantly lower odds of having low muscle mass compared with participants in the first tertile. No significant associations were observed for the remaining three dietary patterns.  3.6. Hypothesis-Orientated Dietary Patterns  Two studies used dietary indexes to assess associations between diet quality and lean- or muscle mass [33,39].",37fda714-de90-41ea-9ec3-38f7762ebeba
10,methods10," The first was a 12-week randomised controlled trial, which used the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (summarised in Table 2) to assess adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern and its association with lean mass [33]. Dietary data were collected using the Wollongong Dietary Inventory, a one-month diet history [40]. Participants in the Mediterranean diet group demonstrated high adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern, with 81% of participants achieving a score of ≥75% on the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener by the study’s conclusion. The Mediterranean diet was associated with significantly lower lean mass at 8-weeks and non-significantly lower lean mass at 12-weeks, compared to the usual care group. The between-group differences were due to a non-significant reduction in lean mass between baseline and weeks 8 and 12 for the Mediterranean diet group, while lean mass remained stable in the usual care group.",02d43f5e-90cc-4b1f-951d-9cf88a90ffe2
11,methods11,"  The second study used the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (summarised in Table 2) to assess cross-sectional associations between diet quality using the Diet History Questionnaire II, a food frequency questionnaire, and muscle mass (derived from SMI) [39]. Overall, 72% of men and 55% of women had low muscle mass. Multivariate linear regression analysis (adjusted for age, gender, and race) demonstrated that diet quality was not associated with muscle mass.  3.7. Dietary Patterns Assessed Using ‘Non-Traditional’ Approaches  Four studies used ‘non-traditional’ approaches to analyse dietary patterns. All four studies investigated variations on the ketogenic dietary pattern and in one study a ‘low carb’ diet was also assessed (ketogenic and ‘low carb’ dietary patterns are summarised in Table 2). Associations between dietary patterns and lean-, fat free- and skeletal muscle mass were investigated [34,35,36,37]. Findings from these studies were unfavourable overall.",d35895dc-2fb6-438f-a6af-d9f995337628
12,methods12," One 12-week randomised controlled trial investigated associations between the ketogenic dietary pattern and lean mass, compared to the lower fat American Cancer Society diet [34]. Approximately 80% of participants adhered to their assigned diet based on the examination of food records and achieving urinary ketone concentrations of approximately 0.5 mmol/L for the ketogenic diet group. The ketogenic diet group appeared to lose lean mass (−0.9 kg) whilst the American Cancer Society diet group maintained lean mass (−0.1 kg). However, after adjusting for baseline conditions, there were no significant differences in lean mass between the ketogenic diet group and American Cancer Society diet group at 12 weeks.  Two non-randomised controlled trials assessed associations between the ketogenic dietary pattern and fat free- and skeletal muscle mass, compared to an unspecified standard diet [35,37]. In both studies, interventions lasted approximately one month (between 34 to 37 days).",ce7ade98-459f-4618-8f5e-84a0add47d3a
13,methods13," Adherence to the ketogenic dietary patterns were assessed based on analysis of food diaries and urinary or capillary ketone concentrations. In the first study by Klement et al. 2020 [37], mean (0.72 mmol/L) and median (0.49 mmol/L) fasting ketone concentrations were significantly higher in the ketogenic diet group compared to the standard diet group (mean 0.13, median 0.06 mmol/L; p < 2.2 × 10−16). Three participants were excluded due to noncompliance with the ketogenic diet. In the second study by Klement et al. 2021 [35] median capillary ketone concentrations in the ketogenic group were 0.6 mmol/L and all participants achieved at least one ketone measurement < 0.4 mmol/L, thus it was reported that all participants tried to comply with the ketogenic dietary pattern. The ketogenic dietary pattern was associated with significant reductions in fat free mass (−1.23 kg) [37] and skeletal muscle mass (−0.71 kg and −0.",99a74387-0de1-401c-a0f5-a8f44ba9e028

Finally, one 20-week non-randomised controlled trial compared a healthy standard diet, ‘low carb’ and ketogenic diet (as part of a multimodal rehabilitation program) for the associations with skeletal muscle mass [36]. Adherence to the respective dietary patterns were assessed by analysis of food diaries plus the analysis of urinary ketones for the ketogenic diet group. Patients in the ketogenic diet group achieved the intended ketogenic ratio (grams of fat divided by grams of carbohydrates plus protein) of 1:6:1, which was significantly higher than the low carbohydrate diet and standard diet groups. The low carbohydrate diet was associated with significant losses of skeletal muscle mass (−0.9 kg), whilst the ketogenic dietary pattern (−0.9 kg) and standard diet (−0.3 kg) were associated with non-significant losses of skeletal muscle mass.  4.",72322125-c31f-4d90-afd1-e52aff98a3c6
15,methods15," Discussion  The main finding from this scoping review was that adherence to a ‘fat and fish’ diet, derived using a data-driven dietary patterns approach, may be associated with lower odds of having low muscle mass in people with gastrointestinal cancers. Hypothesis-orientated dietary patterns, developed to improve health and prevent chronic diseases, and adherence to ketogenic or ‘low carb’ dietary pattern were either not associated with or negatively associated with muscle (lean) mass in various cancers. Of the seven studies reviewed, all examined lean-, skeletal muscle- or fat-free mass, omitting malnutrition, sarcopenia as potentially important cancer-related outcomes. Overall, the methods used to analyse dietary patterns varied across studies as did the dietary intake assessment methods (i.e., food frequency questionnaires and food diaries).",bc96f805-add8-40fb-b74c-72e1b7e5cea1
16,methods16," The small number of eligible studies and their heterogeneity in study design limited our ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding the associations between dietary patterns and cancer-related muscle mass.  4.1. Data-Driven Dietary Patterns and Muscle Mass  Only one study used data-driven methods to derive dietary patterns in Portuguese adults with gastrointestinal cancers [38]. This was the only dietary pattern to have a positive effect on muscle mass. High adherence to a ‘fat and fish’ diet, characterised by intake of high fat foods and fish, was associated with approximately 70% lower odds of having low muscle mass [38]. Interestingly, this finding does not align with recent studies of comparable ‘unhealthy’ or ‘high-fat’ diets in healthy adults. Specifically, in a three year prospective study including 757 community dwelling older adults, Granic et al.",570f1d7e-dc98-43ca-86c1-c7e56882bc1d
17,methods17," [43], demonstrated a ‘Traditional British’ diet, encompassing high fat and energy intake from butter, red meat, gravy, potatoes, sweet and desserts was associated with 75% and 150% increased odds of sarcopenia (defined as low SMI and low gait speed or grip strength) at baseline and three years, respectively, compared to those consuming a ‘low butter’ reference diet. Alternatively, in a 15-year longitudinal study including 522 healthy Australian men, Davis et al. [44] found that scoring higher for a ‘Traditional’ dietary pattern, characterised by a greater consumption of fruit and vegetables, nuts, unprocessed fish and red and white meats, predicted a greater SMI (beta-co-efficient: 0.12 kg/m2; p < 0.05) over the 15 years follow up.  The variation in findings may be due to the differing nutritional needs of people with cancer compared to healthy adults.",3e0568ea-c517-40d0-b9ba-2a3d8c55f255
18,methods18," Nutritional recommendations for people with cancer are commonly enhanced in order to counter the metabolic demands of anticancer treatments and the disease itself [19]. The ‘fat and fish’ dietary pattern derived by Velho et al. [38] was energy dense and contained fish, which is both a source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids, consistent with nutrient-specific recommendations made in international nutritional guidelines for cancer [19]. The ‘fat and fish’ dietary pattern also reflects the principals of a ‘high-energy high-protein’ diet, which is commonly prescribed in clinical practice by nutrition professionals. For example, energy dense ‘discretionary’ foods may be recommended to patients with low appetite to provide sufficient energy and protein in smaller, easy to consume foods. In all, the ‘fat and fish’ dietary pattern may provide adequate energy- and nutrient-dense foods, sufficient to attenuate muscle loss in people with cancer.",758ddf62-a541-49dd-8348-ade92782301b
19,methods19," However, it remains unclear whether a dietary pattern containing ‘healthier’ and less-processed food sources of energy, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids, may be more beneficial and equally palatable to people with cancer, especially those experiencing low appetite or other intake limiting side effects, compared to high saturated fat snacks such as chocolates and cookies.  4.2. Hypothesis-Orientated and ‘Non-Traditional’ Dietary Patterns and Muscle Mass  The majority of studies identified in this scoping review used hypothesis-orientated or ‘non-traditional’ methods to assess dietary patterns in association with muscle (lean) mass. Two different hypothesis-orientated dietary indexes were used, the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener [33] and Healthy Eating Index 2010 [39]. Biological samples were primarily used to assess adherence to variations of the ketogenic diet [34,35,36,37].",9c04bda7-da03-4563-afa9-cf1ae04feb77
20,methods20," Although the latter are not considered ‘true’ dietary patterns, as they were not assessed using known assessment methods, they provide context to the current body of literature and will be discussed here. All studies found that hypothesis-orientated dietary patterns and ‘non-traditional’ dietary patterns (ketogenic and low carbohydrate diets) were either not associated with muscle (lean) mass [34,39] or were detrimental regardless of cancer type [33,35,36,37].  There are likely multiple reasons why these dietary patterns were not beneficial. Firstly, the hypothesis-orientated dietary patterns described in this scoping review were primarily developed to improve general health and prevent chronic disease, rather than to improve muscle (lean) mass. To date, there are no muscle-specific dietary indexes developed for the purpose of attenuating muscle loss or improving muscle mass, strength, or function in people with cancer.",de0fb7a9-82b9-4f5d-bb24-211c4a3fed0c
21,methods21," As such, it is unclear whether the dietary indexes examined in this review promote intake of sufficient energy and nutrient profile to meet the increased needs of people with cancer. For example, a review by Romagnolo et al. [45] suggests that despite the positive anti-inflammatory properties of the Mediterranean diet, foods and nutrients which constitute the diet may be insufficient to meet the protein and vitamin D recommendations of people with cancer. Similarly, a ketogenic diet, which is defined by a minimal intake of carbohydrates and high intake of fats, is commonly associated with weight loss. Whilst the majority of studies in this scoping review did not report on energy intake of participants, losses of body mass and fat mass [34,35,36,37] may suggest that energy intake was inadequate to meet the needs of people with cancer, potentially promoting loss of muscle mass.",bf87115e-7124-4393-8d63-b4bf6258ff88
22,methods22,"  Another explanation for the negative findings associated with hypothesis-orientated dietary patterns may be related to the foods and beverages which constitute these diets. Each dietary pattern including Mediterranean, Healthy Eating Index and ketogenic and ‘low carb’ diets, are characterised by certain foods. For example, the Mediterranean diet promotes intake of extra-virgin olive oil, fruits and vegetables, wholegrain cereals, nuts and legumes, and a moderate to small amount of fish, meat and dairy products [46]. Therefore, the appropriateness of these dietary patterns for people with cancer must be considered. Nutrition impact symptoms are common among people undergoing treatment for cancer and into survivorship, those such as low appetite, pain, change in dentition or taste function may prevent adequate dietary intake [47].",efbf063b-4071-48b8-a4ca-174e4121b8da
23,methods23," As such, abundance of low energy, fibrous foods, may not be optimal to meet the nutritional demands of people with cancer, nor be appropriate or palatable for those experiencing nutrition impact symptoms. Nutrition impact symptoms were not reported in the studies in this review; however, their impact on compliance must be considered in this context.  Like data-driven dietary patterns, there is a paucity of studies regarding the role of hypothesis-orientated dietary patterns on muscle (lean) mass in people with cancer. The majority of studies identified in this review included people with prostate [33] ovarian and endometrial [34] and breast cancers [36,37], which are not generally associated with heightened nutritional risk. Therefore, it is difficult to generalise these findings to other cancer types more typically associated with a higher risk of malnutrition and muscle loss, such as lung or gastrointestinal cancers. Baguley et al.",f537c50a-c2fc-4f2c-a202-4c5982f4844c
24,methods24," [33] examined the effects of a 12-week Mediterranean diet intervention compared to usual care, on lean mass in men with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy. Whilst men with prostate cancer are considered at low risk of malnutrition, androgen deprivation therapy is commonly associated with marked changes in body composition, namely loss of muscle mass and gain of fat mass [48]. Therefore, loss of lean mass in this instance may, at least in part, be a product of treatment effects rather than dietary intake.  4.3. Implications for Future Research  This scoping review revealed a paucity of studies examining the associations between dietary patterns and low muscle mass in adults with cancer. Of particular note, examination of malnutrition and sarcopenia were entirely absent from the identified literature. Therefore, it remains unclear whether dietary patterns have any impact upon these prevalent conditions.",a361d5be-7f19-4e23-a208-9825d54c6938
25,methods25," Most included studies employed ‘non-traditional’ approaches to analyse dietary patterns, using biological ketone analysis and food records, to assess adherence to nonhomogeneous ketogenic diets, rather than recognised dietary indexes. Whilst some limited research supports the role of ketogenic diets as a concurrent therapeutic option for cancer, for example, in cases of malignant glioma [49,50], this review demonstrates they have a detrimental effect on muscle mass. A dietary index, reflecting the current knowledge of diet-muscle relationships, rather than to improve general health and prevent chronic disease, may provide further insights into the role of diet on muscle mass. As one does not currently exist, its development should consider the unique nutritional needs and types of foods that are tolerated by people with cancer.  Dietary patterns derived from data-driven methods were particularly sparse. Principal component analysis was used by Velho et al.",e1aaae75-d35b-4581-a917-9a72a824a233
26,methods26," [38] to derive dietary patterns by aggregating foods into distinct groups. However, principal component analysis and other data-driven dietary patterns approaches are limited by their lack of consideration paid to the health outcomes of interest, such as muscle mass. Hybrid dietary patterns methods, such as reduced rank regression, negate this limitation by combining traditional data-driven dietary pattern approaches whilst considering variation in intermediate response variables, such as nutrients important to muscle health (i.e., protein and omega-3 fatty acids) [51]. Future studies should consider hybrid methods to generate dietary patterns specific to cancer-related muscle loss.  4.4. Strengths and Limitations  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to summarise the impact of dietary patterns and cancer-related muscle loss. This scoping review has several key strengths.",a7cec92d-8c7a-466b-9e34-d5926902c9f5
27,methods27," Firstly, rigorous systematic procedures were adhered to in order to generate a robust search strategy and data charting processes, whilst observing the PRISMA protocol extension for scoping reviews [31]. Key gaps in the existing literature have also been identified in an attempt to encourage the prioritisation of important oncological research, such as the development of a muscle-specific dietary index suitable to people with cancer and/or the use of reduce rank regression approaches to derive dietary patterns, which are specific to cancer-related muscle loss, malnutrition, and sarcopenia.  However, these findings should be interpreted in light of some potential methodological limitations. Firstly, specific search terms were explored within three comprehensive research databases to capture all of the relevant studies appropriate to our aim.",be470fda-ee66-4ac2-9b6c-88c066487a8d
28,methods28," However, studies may have been unintentionally omitted by the chosen search strategy, such as those which do not explicitly utilise known data-driven or hypothesis-orientated methods to assess dietary patterns (i.e., ketogenic diets). Secondly, consistent with scoping review methodology, a critical appraisal or risk of bias assessment was not conducted on the identified studies and as such the quality of the studies has not been considered. In all, a small number of eligible studies were identified which were heterogeneous in regard to cancer types and treatment modalities, and methods used to assess dietary patterns making it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the most appropriate dietary pattern for people with cancer. However, in line with our aims, we have provided an overview of the existing body of literature regardless of the methodological quality of the studies within.  5.",62186e1f-ad0a-4445-8d99-da58fca83d39
29,methods29," Conclusions  This scoping review provided some evidence that a ‘fat and fish’ diet, derived using data-driven dietary patterns methods, may be associated with reduced risk of low muscle mass in people with cancer. Adherence to a priori dietary patterns yielded inconsistent findings. The small number of eligible studies identified and heterogeneity in cancer diagnoses and treatment modalities, and methods used to derive or assess adherence to dietary patterns makes interpretation of the current findings difficult. Further research is needed, employing all dietary patterns approaches, including hybrid methods, and examining malnutrition, and sarcopenia in addition to low muscle mass, to draw a holistic picture of the role of diet in oncological practice. Such research will likely be complementary to our current knowledge of the role of single nutrients and foods on nutritional status and muscle health in cancer and support the development of recommendations for clinical practice.
