0,introduction0," Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD)) has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide (1–3). Currently, 25% of the global and 90% of the obese population have some degrees of non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). The global prevalence of its active stage, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)), is ~3–5% (2). non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) comprises a spectrum of liver disease, clinically defined as more than 5% hepatic fat accumulation excluding significant alcohol consumption and other hepatic diseases (4, 5). It ranges from benign steatosis to non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by hepatocellular inflammation and ballooning, which can subsequently result in hepatic fibrosis (6, 7). Fibrotic non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can progress to cirrhosis and it can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)), even at the precirrhotic stage.",2235c0fc-1c52-4f19-a3cd-84ea68bec62f
1,introduction1," Indeed, several studies have found a strong relation of non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) fibrosis stage with liver-related morbidity and mortality and also with all-cause mortality (8, 9). Several driving factors for a progressive non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) course have been recognized. In addition to obesity, insulin resistance and the related metabolic syndrome (MetS), and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly related to non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Approximately 60% of patients with T2DM have non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (10–12). Consequently, patients with T2DM have a 2.5-fold higher risk of mortality due to chronic liver disease than non-diabetics (13), and this risk is elevated in MetS as well (14).",3a591da5-07db-4b73-ad2d-2c5108f5492c
2,introduction2," non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) often gives mixed hyperlipidemia with elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TGs); over 50% of patients with dyslipidemia have non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (10, 15). In addition to obesity and T2DM, high-calorie intake, a Western-type diet, a sedentary lifestyle, sleep apneas, and low-grade inflammation arising from gut microbial dysbiosis or inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis contribute to drive progression along the non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) spectrum (16–20).  Cornerstone interventions in halting or reversing non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) progression are lifestyle changes toward healthy diet and increased physical activity (21–24).",329ee27d-085a-483a-9551-f0539bcd80bd
3,introduction3," Several international guidelines for the clinical management of non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) endorse weight loss either through the combination of dietary modifications and physical activity or either through one of these two alone. A reduction of hepatic steatosis can already be achieved with a weight loss of 5–7%, and to improve fibrosis and inflammation, more than 10% of weight loss is suggested (25, 26). Several dietary factors, such as increased intake of refined carbohydrates, in particular, fructose and sucrose and foods high in saturated fat, such as processed meat or high fat dairy have been associated with the development of non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (27–29). On the contrary, dietary fiber and unsaturated fatty acids have been shown to reduce de novo lipogenesis, improve insulin sensitivity, increase satiety, and modulate gut microbiota attenuating the development or the onset of non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (29, 30).",236b5b6b-0907-4306-bf1c-db38646000b5
4,introduction4," However, there is still no consensus of the macronutrient composition for the dietary modifications for patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Whereas, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)), European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN), and American Gastroenterology Association (American Gastroenterology Association (AGA)) propose the Mediterranean style diet, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD)) does not directly recommend a particular diet, although the Mediterranean diet is mentioned (21–24). Moreover, recently published systematic reviews (SRs) on dietary modifications include studies with dietary interventions combined with physical activity (31, 32). Therefore, the evidence on the effects of specific dietary approaches alone on non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) seems poorly aggregated.",871888e4-c7f3-4139-b102-919b7f690298
5,introduction5," Of note, none of the SRs studied the effect of dietary modifications on the liver inflammation or fibrosis, the progressive stages of non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) related to morbidity and mortality.  In this systematic review, we aimed to review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with dietary interventions without any exercise or physical activity intervention in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) in order to establish the effect of different dietary modifications on intrahepatic lipid content (intrahepatic lipid content (IHL)), liver fibrosis, and liver function in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Additionally, the effects of dietary interventions on body weight, glucose metabolism, and plasma lipid profile were reviewed. This work is of great value due to the inclusion of dietary intervention studies per se, that is, without exercise or physical activity interventions, in well-characterized study populations.

All continuous parameters were displayed as standardized mean difference (standardized mean difference (SMD)) to measure the effect size and were presented with 95% confidence interval (CI). Fixed or random effect model was used to pool and calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) from baseline to follow-up between intervention and control group. I2 was used to assess the heterogeneity across the studies. Low heterogeneity was considered if I2 was <25% and the fixed effect model was applied for the meta-analysis. In case of moderate (25–50%) and high heterogeneity (>50%), the random effect model was used. ",9e657430-978d-443d-80ef-1dace1fa5e6f

In the study by Ryan et al. (45), subjects undertook both diets according to a cross-over design with a washout period of 6 weeks. The Mediterranean diet in these studies mainly consisted of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and unsaturated dietary fats from vegetable oils. The study by Dorosti et al.

However, paired liver stiffness measurement (LSM) did not show any significant change after the diet intervention between the intervention and the control group. In another study, the diagnosis of non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) by the liver biopsy together with US was an inclusion criterion, but the liver biopsy was not repeated after the intervention as an outcome measure of the intervention (45). Altogether, none of the studies assessed the liver histology or used multiparametric imaging in order to establish the effects of dietary interventions on the active or fibrotic non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).",e5798f01-53f6-4bbc-8c47-83d08785bb1e

In total, eight studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Dietary interventions were grouped based on the energy intake in the studies resulting in four studies in each group. Further assessment was applied based on the composition of the dietary interventions in order to perform the meta-analysis. This led to the selection of two (hypocaloric dietary interventions) or three (isocaloric dietary interventions) studies for pooled comparisons.",5f15a549-5de2-401b-b9cc-c022fc4ffce3
41,discussion1," Our meta-analysis shows that the Mediterranean diet reduces liver fat in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD), and a hypocaloric dietary approach favoring unsaturated fatty acids reduces liver transaminases as a clinical proxy for non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); yet no conclusions can be drawn on active or fibrotic non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).  We were able to replicate the findings from previous systematic reviews investigating the Mediterranean diet on the liver fat (31, 47). The Mediterranean diet without caloric restriction reduced the liver fat compared to the control group in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Propezi et al. (44) and Ryan et al. (45) constructed the Mediterranean diet based on the actual reported data on the consumption of a Cretan diet with similar composition of macronutrients from similar sources, whereas the study by Misciagna et al. (43) did not report any basis on the construction of the diet.",8d1ea523-e37e-4dca-b3bc-bc5048fb9965
42,discussion2," However, it contained similar macronutrient composition and foods, and they also used a Mediterranean adequacy index (Mediterranean adequacy index (MAI)) to follow the adherence to the diet. Based on the information on the diet compositions, the diets in these studies can be considered comparable. In general, the Mediterranean diet is characterized by high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, including polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) and monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) whose main sources are vegetable oils, fish, nuts, and seeds. These can contribute to the beneficial effects on the liver fat (48). For instance, higher consumption of walnuts has been shown to associate with a greater improvement of the liver fat in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (49).",b70a0bb1-3dcf-4b74-a134-43d687107971
43,discussion3," In general, the Mediterranean diet is associated with a 56% decreased risk for non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) in a cross-sectional setting (48). Moreover, the Mediterranean diet is also composed of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole-grain products that are high in dietary fiber. In fact, the intake of dietary fiber is inversely associated with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (50). Additionally, the study by Dorosti et al. (42), which was not a part of the meta-analysis, showed a resolution in steatosis, together with a decrease in the liver enzymes after a 12-week whole-grain diet compared to the control diet with usual cereal consumption. This effect may be explained partly due to the fiber content and its effects on the digestion and the gut microbiome, and also due to the properties of phenolic compounds from the whole-grain foods.",d72313e7-c99e-46ba-ab73-c3a2a8beab85
44,discussion4," These phenolic compounds include anthocyanins and flavonoids that have been associated with anti-inflammatory properties and the so called antioxidants (51, 52). However, a supplementation of antioxidants did not give any additional benefits to the Mediterranean diet on the liver fat, but together with green tea, the liver fat improved more significantly than with the diet alone (53). Furthermore, the gut microbiome might mediate some of the metabolic effects of the Mediterranean diet which could contribute to the regression of non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (49, 50, 54). The change in intrahepatic lipid content (IHL) after an 18-month Mediterranean diet was independently associated with the gut microbial compositional changes, depicted in β-diversity and taxa level (49). In general, the diet has distinct impacts on the gut microbiome, and certain gut microbial signatures has been related to non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (55–58).",4abbacba-5af8-4e45-abfa-543c079a2406
45,discussion5," Therefore, investigating this triangle could give more insights on the mechanisms behind the effects of dietary interventions on non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD).  Interestingly, the study by Jang et al. (39), one of the hypocaloric dietary interventions, detected a significant decrease in intrahepatic lipid content (IHL) in a low-carbohydrate diet compared to a low-fat diet. However, their low-carbohydrate diet had 50–60% of energy intake as carbohydrates being still in a normal range of carbohydrate intake, and 20–25% of fat which was higher than in the low-fat diet (15–20%). A SR reported that replacing total fats with total carbohydrates does not reduce the liver fat; however, types of carbohydrates were not able to be assessed due to lack of reporting. In turn, replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats is beneficial to the liver fat (32). Proportion of nutrients toward higher unsaturated fat ratio could contribute to steatosis regression.",6c476466-1e0f-4fd2-a8a0-77dc2fad2ed3
46,discussion6," All individual hypocaloric dietary interventions reported a decrease of intrahepatic lipid content (IHL) together with a significant weight loss but due to the different methods for measuring intrahepatic lipid content (IHL), an overall effect via meta-analysis could not be assessed. Altogether, the dietary fiber and unsaturated fatty acids from foods in the Mediterranean diet can be considered one of the dietary components contributing to the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet on the liver fat.  The pooled effect of two hypocaloric diets containing foods high in unsaturated fatty acids show reduction on liver transaminases, such as alanine transaminase (ALT) and aminotransferase (AST), compared to the control group (40, 41). We were not able to do meta-analysis on the liver fat with these studies due to the different assessment techniques, but all hypocaloric studies reported a significant decrease in intrahepatic lipid content (IHL) (38–41).",c8f51449-86f5-4c24-be61-c3251197b9f6
47,discussion7," Our results of the liver transaminases are in accordance with the previous studies, where a hypocaloric diet improved the liver function through weight loss supporting the beneficial effect of hypocaloric diet via weight loss on the liver-related parameters (59, 60). A dose-response relationship between weight loss and improvements in the liver-related outcomes in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) has been reported previously; a hypocaloric diet targeting to 5–7% weight loss reduced steatosis, while over 10% weight loss significantly improved non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis (25, 61). Furthermore, the meta-analysis of the Mediterranean diet showed a tendency toward increased alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. Additionally, the levels of γGT did not show any significant change after the Mediterranean dietary interventions compared to the control diet. Similar results have been reported also by other SR before (40).",7e13d29a-b9d7-4a18-8c1a-f895970a955a
48,discussion8," It is known that γGT is dependent on age, gender, and alcohol consumption (62). However, in all the three studies, high alcohol consumption was an exclusion criterion and it was not changed during the interventions. A non-significant change could be explained by several other factors, such as medication, smoking, and several other diseases, which are all associated with increased γGT (63–65). None of the Mediterranean dietary intervention studies reported significant change in weight between intervention or control group, but studies by Propezi et al. (44) and Misciagna et al. (43) showed significant weight loss within the groups. Regarding the macronutrient composition of dietary interventions, the effect of macronutrient composition on the liver enzymes is still controversial (32). The study by Arefhosseini et al.",f54ededf-dcdc-4592-b9d0-0a6658898f23
49,discussion9," (38) aimed to address this with two hypocaloric diets with different macronutrient compositions, where both diets were as effective on hepatic outcomes (the liver enzymes and echogenicity) indicating weight loss-induced effects, despite macronutrient composition. In turn, Jang et al. (39) reported greater and significant improvement of alanine transaminase (ALT) in the low-carbohydrate group compared to the low-fat group. Limited number of studies limits our conclusions with respect to the liver enzymes. Overall, hypocaloric dietary interventions in this systematic review showed a significant improvement in the liver enzymes, but our meta-analysis supports dietary interventions with foods high in unsaturated fatty acids.  Our systematic review does not show significant changes in the concentrations of fasting glucose or insulin or HOMA-IR in studies with the Mediterranean diet.",f41bbd11-109a-40e7-9f0c-5eb44fbbf362
50,discussion10," Similar results have been reported in other studies, where the Mediterranean diet does not show significant improvements in fasting glucose or insulin concentrations over the control diet, but HOMA-IR, as a surrogate marker for the insulin resistance, showed a significant improvement in another SRs in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (31, 47). This could be due to the limited number of studies in our SR. However, an improvement of HOMA-IR could indicate a decline in the insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is thought to be the major driver for non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD), but it mainly concerns patients without a genetic predisposition, the genetic variant of the gene that encodes patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) (66, 67). Unfortunately, we were not able to investigate the influence of the genetic variants in our meta-analysis due to lack of data and reported endpoints in the studies.",3e179843-644a-4931-ba80-404c817d3c81
51,discussion11," However, individual assessment of the isocaloric studies indicates a significant improvement of HOMA-IR only in one study with the Mediterranean diet (45) and no effect in two studies with either the Mediterranean or a whole-grain diet (42, 44). No significant changes in glucose or insulin concentrations compared to the control diet were reported in either of the isocaloric studies (42–45). None of the hypocaloric dietary interventions showed significant changes in insulin and glucose concentrations (39, 40) or HOMA-IR (40). Ultimately, dietary intervention studies, both hypo and isocaloric, investigating parameters related to glucose metabolism in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) are controversial. More studies are needed in order to assess different dietary approaches to glucose metabolism in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD).",4d11dfa8-ae21-4801-be30-31ec1745d58d
52,discussion12,"  Our meta-analysis shows no significant reduction but a strong trend toward improvement in TG concentrations in isocaloric studies. This trend is in line with other SRs investigating the effect of the Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular risk factors in non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (6, 68). Elevated TGs and their increased ratio to HDL-C are associated with the increased risk of CVD and its outcomes (69, 70), as well as LDL-C concentration is strongly linked to coronary heart disease (71). Moreover, the Mediterranean diet has been linked to reduced risk for cardiometabolic diseases which are thought to be explained by the beneficial effects of vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds which are low in saturated fatty acids and high in unsaturated fatty acids and fiber. It may be also partly due to the effects of phytosterols and phytostanols affecting the intestinal cholesterol absorption (72–74).",cfe31049-0f6c-4fc0-831d-058993039c1a
53,discussion13," However, in our pooled analysis with the Mediterranean diet, TC or lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (HDL-C, LDL-C) did not show significant changes. This is also in line with other SRs that do not report changes in lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in the Mediterranean diet in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (47). Moreover, individual assessment of all studies in our review showed that isocaloric dietary interventions can improve plasma lipid profile in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). The hypocaloric dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet with increased intake of foods high in unsaturated fatty acids reported a decrease in concentrations of triglycerides, TC, and LDL-C (40), but unfortunately, pooled effect on lipids could not be investigated with any of the hypocaloric interventions. A clinically significant decrease in TG concentration in the intervention group was shown by Razavi et al. (40).",6eba2848-12d4-4044-af05-17788b1db7f2
54,discussion14," Arefhosseini et al. (38) showed that only a hypocaloric diet with decreased intake of both carbohydrates and dietary fat decreased the concentration of TGs significantly compared to the other diet. Also, Jang et al. (39) reported an increase with a low-carbohydrate diet. Cross-sectional data show that the intake of cholesterol and consumption of foods high in saturated fatty acids have been associated with the risk for non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (50). In general, limiting the intake of unsaturated fatty acids is associated with the lower risk of cardiovascular events (75). As CVD is the main cause of mortality among patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD), the quality of dietary fats and other sources of fat, such as meat and dairy, require special attention (76).",45ed8cbf-9f72-49fc-9286-79c81c71050a
55,discussion15," Additionally, the Western type of dietary pattern high in processed foods, refined grains, and saturated fatty acids from high fat dairy and meat increase the risk for non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) by 23% (48).  Currently, dietary modification, exercise, or the combination of both, targeting weight loss is the key therapy for non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (21–24). Our results showed that the Mediterranean diet without weight loss can also improve the liver parameters. Both dietary interventions in this SR are in accordance with European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), ESPEN, American Gastroenterology Association (AGA), and American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guidelines, where a hypocaloric or the Mediterranean diet is suggested as a dietary treatment for non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD).",853dd495-bc51-4f8f-9152-adc5be96ce9d
56,discussion16," However, current guidelines do not address the optimal dietary strategy specifically for active, fibrotic, and cirrhotic non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), although it contributes to the overall burden of the disease, not only on the t point of view of patients but also economically on the public health (77–80). Due to this burden, different stages, especially active and fibrotic non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cannot be disregarded when designing future studies. Furthermore, based on the knowledge of the distinct metabolic effects of genetic variants on the pathophysiology on non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD), the genetic predispositions should have more attention in lifestyle interventions.",3c1dee3d-a802-41dc-bbba-cf3637b4baac
57,discussion17," We suggest that more RCTs with different comparable dietary intervention studies including well-characterized non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) patients and valid endpoint measures, including histology and/or multiparametric imaging are warranted in order to identify and address the optimal dietary approaches in the future guidelines. This would help clinicians to develop care pathways and target their resources efficiently in the different stages of non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). However, compliance and successful treatment require that the patient is motivated and engaged to the lifestyle modifications (81, 82). Therefore, the optimal treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) should be patient-centered and multidisciplinary (83). In order to achieve these goals, we need more awareness from the policy, care pathway, and guideline creators (83, 84).",0ab2d7cf-a5da-4139-be4c-07548f5ebf70
58,discussion18," Additionally, non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) should be incorporated in the national health prevention and care strategies due to its large public health burden.  One of the main strengths of this SR is the study inclusion criteria, which resulted in a well-characterized study population focusing on non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Also, studies were limited to dietary interventions without any kind of exercise or physical activity intervention. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been done before in SRs investigating dietary interventions in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Moreover, the quality assessment was conducted by a tool which is specifically designed for dietary intervention studies in a three-category grading system. This allows more detailed and valid assessment of the quality of the studies. However, this paper has also some limitations. First, due to the small number of studies, meta-analyses were limited.",b63e9a1d-245b-4ce9-9e5c-3d03becede3e
59,discussion19," In addition, most of the studies were performed in Iran which could cause some bias. Therefore, the reliability of the results should be interpreted with some caution. With a higher number of studies, it would be probably possible to show more robust effects of different dietary interventions in several parameters. Consequently, a publication-bias detection analysis could not be performed due to the lack of power with a small number of studies. Another limitation is the missing genetic predispositions. Genetic variants should be assessed in dietary intervention studies since the presence of those variants affect lipid and glucose metabolism. Moreover, most of the studies do not report the severity and the activity of the disease which potentially affects the endpoints. Thus, by reporting this and its influence on the results could improve the analysis.",4bca445d-b25e-4ecf-b99d-c70557cb471b
60,discussion20,"  In conclusion, the Mediterranean and hypocaloric dietary interventions favoring unsaturated fatty acids result in improvements in intrahepatic lipid content (IHL) independent of weight loss, and transaminases are reduced in the hypocaloric diets with weight loss in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Since many dietary intervention studies are combined with exercise interventions or physical activity, the diet effect alone is not investigated enough. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, studies addressing the genetic background in diet interventions are missing. Furthermore, more advanced and clinically relevant stages of non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD), that is active and fibrotic non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with multiparametric imaging and liver histology as outcome measures, are not sufficiently considered. Therefore, the optimal dietary invention in non alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) remains to be defined.",4174fee2-c5b1-49e9-a3c2-835e95683f00
