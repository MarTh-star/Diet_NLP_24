0,introduction0," Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) as well as other amyloid-related neurodegenerative ailments are age-related multifaceted pathological conditions in which a broad range of events lead to the impairment of brain activity with cognitive disability as the main clinical hallmark. The majority of nonfamilial neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by gradual development, usually spanning many years, and with the appearance of their clinical signs at the later stage, when cell decay is obvious and cannot be reversed. In spite of numerous efforts to understand the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying AD and PD pathologies and their potential triggers, effective disease-modifying treatments still remain elusive. Therefore, the delay of the disease onset by a healthy lifestyle and diet remains the best strategy.  Neuroinflammation and amyloid burden are two characteristic pathologies of AD, PD, and other neurodegenerative disorders.",57c29db3-06b9-46ef-9cc8-26f2a72e6b40
1,introduction1,"1−3 The amyloid cascade is linked to the failure of polypeptides to adopt and retain their native structure and function, leading to their conversion into toxic amyloid oligomers and insoluble amyloid deposits. The amyloid conversion impairs the physiological function of native polypeptide and leads to a gain in amyloid cytotoxicity. The latter further interferes with signaling pathways and cell homeostasis, including redox equilibrium, free Ca2+ level, and proteostasis.4 Distinct polypeptides are associated with particular human disorders, notably the Aβ peptide with AD and α-synuclein with PD; however, the growth and deposition of amyloids are shared features of numerous amyloid neurodegenerative diseases.",e273d13b-4f69-4c69-ac76-66a6670f12ab
2,introduction2,"2 Previously, neuroinflammation was viewed as a reaction to the degeneration process; however, presently, it is known that neuroinflammation may play a central role in triggering and promoting neurodegeneration, since inflammation processes in the brain environment may promote amyloid self-assembly. In AD and PD, the affected tissues in the brain display a range of damaging responses, including substantial activation of microglia and an increase in the level of inflammatory cytokines, which sustain inflammation and exacerbate neurodegeneration.5−8  Recently, we have reported that the pro-inflammatory and amyloidogenic protein S100A9 is a major contributor to both the amyloid and neuroinflammatory cascades in AD, PD, and traumatic brain injury; importantly, traumatic brain injury may play a role of the precursor state for numerous neurodegenerative conditions.",2cb0e70f-586a-4867-b6aa-7abf1b6e4df0
3,introduction3," Thus, S100A9 may bridge the amyloid self-assembly and inflammation into the distinctive and common neurodegenerative disease feature: the amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascade.9−11 S100A9 has been described as an alarmin implicated in numerous signaling pathways in cancers and inflammation-related diseases.12,13 The high level of S100A9 expression was also observed in malaria,14 ischemia,15 obesity,16 and cardiovascular disease.17 The S100A9 mRNA was found to be abundant in numerous aged mammalian organs, also involving the central nervous system; consequently, it was suggested that an age-associated inflammation is implicated and persists due to continued S100A9 production.18  Previously, we have found that S100A9 is a very amyloidogenic protein; i.e., in vitro S100A9 aggregates easily under a physiological environment, and its self-assembly is well-defined by a nucleation-autocatalytic growth model.",439a4897-164b-402f-9eac-c55e8980527b
4,introduction4,"19 The S100A9 self-assembly into amyloids results in acquired cytotoxicity, exceeding the levels of Aβ peptide amyloid cytotoxicity in AD11 and α-synuclein amyloid cytotoxicity in PD.10 This implies that the increased level of S100A9 persisting during inflammation may provoke its amyloid self-assembly, deposition, and tissue damage, which we observed in neurodegenerative diseases,10,11 in the aged prostate,20 and in the cell model for S100A8 and S100A9 amyloid accumulation.21 Indeed, in AD, S100A9 coassembles with Aβ, leading to intracellular amyloid accumulation and extracellular amyloid plaque growth;11 in PD, S100A9 coaggregates with α-synuclein, which is manifested in Lewy body development,10 while in traumatic brain injury, S100A9 protein deposits into numerous precursor plaques.",53734f9c-e7f3-42e2-b9fb-3b41a77caf00
5,introduction5,"9 We have found also that S100A9 levels in CSF of AD and mild cognitive impairment match those of Aβ, further confirming its involvement in the amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascade even at the disease preclinical and mild stages.22 Thus, S100A9 may easily aggregate by itself or coaggregate with various other proteins and peptides involved in the amyloid-related diseases and may be considered as an object for therapeutic treatments. This is particularly important, since the whole amyloid cascade may be potentially affected or reversed by targeting the amyloid self-assembly of its single component, such as the S100A9 protein.  Despite significant efforts over the past decades, there are still no drugs available to modify amyloid neurodegenerative disease progression, and despite many compounds being characterized by promising amyloid inhibiting properties in in vitro experiments, they failed in the clinical trials.",eec85df9-3889-4c44-9df1-2f5d4d9b2748
6,introduction6," Many low molecular weight substances, peptides, and various antibodies were examined as prospective amyloid modifiers, yet potent, natural compounds without significant side effects are still needed for effective therapeutic treatments.  Numerous clinical trials and population analysis support the notion that the Mediterranean diet correlates with a decreased occurrence of age-related ailments, such as neurodegenerative disorders.23−25 The most important characteristic of the Mediterranean diet is the high consumption of natural plant phenols24 found in many plant products, such as extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)). Oleuropein is a secoiridoid glycoside containing phenylpropanoid alcohol, which can be produced from the biosynthesis of mevalonic acid. After the maturation process and extraction of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), as a result of the β-glucosidase enzyme activity, this secoiridoid is found in its aglyconic form as oleuropein aglycone (OleA) (Figure 1).",740d8b6f-470d-40b7-a012-5e0e75a42caa
7,introduction7," Oleuropein and its derivatives found in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) received particular attention due to their multiple important and protective functionalities, including antioxidant, antiviral, antitumor, antimicrobial, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, antiaging, antidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory effects.23 Olive polyphenols, such as OleA and its main metabolite hydroxytyrosol, were studied for many years by us and other researchers regarding their effects on the aggregation pathways of various polypeptides involved in amyloid and neurodegenerative diseases, including Aβ peptide, tau protein, amylin, transthyretin, and α-synuclein.",c2014b56-a973-4793-8d48-651a375bf4aa
8,introduction8,"24−31 While multiple effects of olive polyphenols have been detected at the molecular, cellular, and animal model levels, the specific mechanisms remain elusive, and important questions still need to be addressed as to whether there is a generic target or numerous targets along multiple aggregation pathways, which could be individual for each particular polypeptide. In particular, the reduced toxicity of the amyloids developed in the olive polyphenol presence was demonstrated in both cellular and murine models. In cultured cells, their amyloid protection was very significant and started at the level of the cellular membrane, perturbing various signaling pathways.32,33 The experiments were carried out also on the TgCRND8 transgenic mouse model of plaque deposition; the mice were fed daily with an OleA or HT-integrated diet, and it was revealed that the animals displayed a strong improvement of the memory and behavioral deficits compared to untreated littermates.",8578010a-2efa-4fd4-a946-70b2b1e705db
9,introduction9,"34 These were accompanied by a substantial decrease in the quantities of amyloid plaques and the level of neuroinflammation. Moreover, a strong activation of the autophagic response was detected34 with possible involvement of epigenetic modifications.35  Figure 1 Schematic presentation of the chemical structure of oleuropein and oleuropein aglycon (OleA).  Here, we studied the effect produced by OleA on S100A9 amyloid aggregation using a range of complementary methods in biophysics, biochemistry, cell biology, and advanced microscopy. We demonstrated how OleA mitigates S100A9 amyloid cytotoxicity in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. Altogether, these findings shed light on the molecular and cellular determinants of OleA protection from toxic amyloids, highlighting the potential of olive polyphenols in averting AD and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with the amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascade.",c0be6868-f895-4fa9-ba1b-ffc2bea08513
10,introduction10,"  Results and Discussion  Inhibiting S100A9 Amyloid Aggregation by OleA  The kinetics of S100A9 amyloid formation in the presence of increasing OleA concentrations were carried out using the thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence assay as described previously36 and shown in Figure 2A. S100A9 alone assembles into amyloid structures by the nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism,19,37 and its kinetics are characterized by the lack of a significant lag phase and steep growth phase, prior to reaching the plateau level. Upon an increase in the OleA concentrations, the slopes of amyloid growth, reflecting the kinetics rates, as well as the plateau levels where the amyloid assembly reached semiequilibrium noticeably decreased.OleA incubated alone under the same conditions did not interact with ThT as shown in Figure S1 and therefore did not contribute to the overall ThT signal in the corresponding mixtures.",32e330be-d985-4943-b1a7-64577bc20ce1
11,introduction11," The initial parts of the S100A9 amyloid kinetic traces, corresponding to <20% maximal ThT fluorescence intensity values, were fitted using the nucleation-dependent polymerization model38 (Figure 2B). The effective amyloid growth rate constants as well as the plateau levels were significantly decreased upon the increase in OleA concentrations (Figure 2C,D), reflecting the decrease in the overall amount of self-assembled amyloids.

To monitor amyloid morphology during the amyloid self-assembly process, the atomic force microscopy (atomic force microscopy (AFM)) imaging was performed after a 6 and 48 h incubation of S100A9 samples in the presence and absence of OleA concentrations as demonstrated in Figure 2E–L. Already after a 6 h incubation, S100A9 alone formed flexible fibrils with ca. 2 nm height in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) cross sections and 0.28 ± 0.15 μm median length (Figure 2E,M). After a 48 h incubation, S100A9 fibrils grew in length, showing a broad distribution with 0.7 ± 0.4 μm median length, and collapsed and clumped aggregates were formed (Figure 2I,Q).",8df88d18-050f-491e-a550-dc312284f0bb
14,introduction14," Indeed, it has been demonstrated previously that S100A9 flexible fibrils tend to clump upon prolonged incubation.39 Upon incubation with increasing OleA concentrations, the length and relative quantity of S100A9 amyloid fibrils captured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging decreased after both 6 and 48 h incubation periods as demonstrated in Figure 2T. Importantly, the fibrils do not grow further upon increasing the incubation time from 6 to 48 h as summarized by presenting the median values of fibrillar length at different OleA concentrations in Figure 2T. The distributions of fibrillar length in the presence of OleA becomes significantly narrower compared to S100A9 alone (Figure 2M–S). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) heights of S100A9 fibrils in all samples remain about the same, ca. 2 nm, in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) cross sections.",56fef389-5a19-44c6-bb6d-d049cfa22e21
15,introduction15," Interestingly, the decrease in fibrillar length in the presence of OleA correlates with the reduction of total amount of amyloids detected by ThT binding (Figure 2D,T).  The dot blot analysis indicates that the interaction of S100A9 aggregated samples with generic antiamyloid oligomer specific A11 antibodies is noticeable after a 6 h incubation and subsides upon an increase in the OleA concentration, being completely abolished at a S100A9 to OleA molar ratio of 1:10 (Figure S2). After a 48 h incubation, the amount of oligomeric species was significantly diminished in the S100A9 amyloid sample in the absence of OleA and completely absent in the presence of all concentrations of OleA.  Interestingly, upon the addition of OleA to preformed S100A9 fibrils assembled during the 48 h incubation, we observed the decrease of ThT fluorescence, indicating the decrease of amyloid quantity in these samples (Figure 3A).",ad7930e6-3aa4-4a36-93e2-5a8df0ad6e94
16,introduction16," atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging demonstrated that flexible fibrils of S100A9 observed prior to the addition of OleA (Figure 3B) have collapsed into nonfibrillar aggregates after the addition of OleA, i.e., at a 1:2 molar ratio of S100A9 to OleA (Figure 3C).

(C) atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of S100A9 aggregates after the addition of 137 μM OleA to the sample shown in (B). 75 μM S100A9 was subjected to fibrillation in PBS, pH 7.4, at 42 °C. Scan sizes are 2.5 × 2.5 μm.  The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of native S100A9 is characteristic for α-helical protein, displaying minima at 222 and 208 nm, and it was not perturbed upon the addition of OleA (Figure 4).",140c7090-f188-4901-8a28-652593885eab
17,introduction17," This indicates that OleA perturbs the S100A9 structure locally rather than globally. The spectrum of fibrillated S100A9 displayed some changes in its shape with a broad minimum of ellipticity at 214–216 nm, reflecting the development of the β-sheet. It is not excluded that some α-helical structure was preserved in the S100A9 fibrils, since the spectrum is broader then the typical β-sheet spectrum; i.e., the remaining α-helices still can be packed at the fibrillar interface. When S100A9 was incubated in the presence of OleA to induce its amyloid formation, the shape of the CD spectrum remained close to the native-like one, demonstrating that OleA indeed inhibits amyloid development. Interestingly, when OleA was added to the preformed fibrils of S100A9, it induced the changes in the far-UV CD spectrum, which resembles a mixture of α-helices and β-sheets.",b3e3f69d-07f7-41d8-8b03-d6858134cce4
18,introduction18," This indicates that some reduction of the β-sheet content took place (Figure 4), which corresponds to the nonfibrillar aggregate formation described above (Figure 3).  Figure 4 Far-UV CD spectra of native and amyloid S100A9 and the OleA effect on them. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C at the following conditions: 75 μM S100A9 in all samples and 1:2 S100A9 to OleA molar ratio, if OleA is added. PBS, pH 7.4. S100A9 fibrils were formed during the 48 h incubation at 42 °C. Labeling of the samples is shown in the legend.",223895cd-cba2-48a9-9c42-b0b8a8c73a3b
19,introduction19,"  Thus, all above experiments demonstrate consistently that OleA produces a significant inhibiting effect on S100A9 amyloid formation by inhibiting its amyloid oligomerization (dot blot analysis with A11 antibodies) and cross-β-sheet formation (far-UV CD), reducing the effective rate of amyloid assembly (kinetic assay), reducing the length of amyloid fibrils (atomic force microscopy (AFM)), and thus diminishing the overall quantity of the amyloids (ThT fluorescence and atomic force microscopy (AFM)). Moreover, OleA is able to convert the already preformed S100A9 fibrils into unstructured aggregates and potentially make them more susceptible to the clearance process in the body.  Interaction of OleA with Native and Amyloid S100A9 followed by Intrinsic Fluorescence  To shed light on OleA interactions with native and amyloid S100A9, we have titrated both samples with increasing concentrations of OleA and followed the changes by the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp 88.",c2c957af-86f5-44d0-b8e2-82b8bf67af39
20,introduction20," For the titration, we used the S100A9 amyloid sample incubated for 24 h at a 100 μM concentration and subsequently diluted it to 4 μM to prevent fibrillar clumping (Figure 2), and native S100A9 was also taken at 4 μM (both in monomer equivalent). In both samples, we have observed a decrease of the intrinsic fluorescence intensities upon an increase in the OleA concentrations, demonstrating nonhyperbolic concentration dependences, which were fitted with a two binding site model as shown in Figure 5A–C. Both fitting curves were largely overlapped, suggesting the same binding sites in the native and amyloid S100A9 species. Since OleA itself can associate into dimer, trimer, and larger species40 and act as a fluorescence quencher of Trp fluorescence,29 the apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.5 and 200 μM may reflect the cumulative effect of binding and fluorescence quenching produced by the OleA polymorphic species.",612a07a1-eff9-41bf-be69-658023229e1c

22,introduction22," The fluorescence spectral maxima of both native and amyloid S100A9 samples were shifted by ca. 3 nm toward the shorter wavelengths upon an increase in the OleA concentrations (Figure 5D), indicating that in both species Trp 88 becomes even more buried into the hydrophobic interior upon OleA binding.  MD Simulation of the OleA Interaction with S100A9  To shed further light on OleA interactions with S100A9, we have performed the MD simulation of the native S100A9 dimer in the presence of two molecules of monomeric OleA, taking into account that S100A9 self-assembles into a homodimer under native and also destabilizing conditions11,37 (Figure 6). The S100A9 dimer is characterized by a flat surface with no deep cavities, and molecular docking reveals only one major OleA binding site per subunit (Figure 6A). The B-factor presentation of the S100A9 molecules shows that OleA docks into the least mobile part of the S100A9 structure (Figure 6B).",f3589267-f077-49a9-945d-6ac3a0efeb12
23,introduction23,"41 The space filling presentation of the S100A9 dimer with the hydrophobic and charged/hydrophilic residues indicates that OleA binds in a shallow hydrophobic cavity in each subunit (Figure 6C) by forming several dynamic H bonds (Figure 6D). Specifically, these are the hydrogen bonds between S100A9 Glu 72 and the OH group on the OleA aromatic ring, Glu 52, and methyl-ester end of OleA as well as Arg 85 and the carbonyl oxygen on OleA (Figure 6D). In addition, π–π stacking interactions between the Trp 88 and OleA aromatic ring are formed (Figure 6D). The number of dynamic hydrogen bonds per time frame between each OleA molecule and S100A9 subunit varies between 1 and 3 (Figure 6E), which together with π–π stacking interactions may ensure micromolar to submicromolar binding affinities, observed in the fluorescence titration measurements (Figure 5).",6a549085-3cd4-4cd1-9199-858dca3dbec0
24,introduction24," The root mean square deviation (root mean square deviation (RMSD)) graph demonstrates that, due to the lack of a well-defined binding cavity, OleA molecules may dissociate from the S100A9 dimer after ca. 15 ns (Figure 6F). The high mobility of OleA at the S100A9 surface can disrupt the optimal protein–ligand orientations and the maximal number of binding interactions, suggesting that OleA binding may involve multiple events. The high-affinity interactions reflect the optimal ligand–protein orientation and the maximal number of binding interactions, while the suboptimal orientation and lower number of binding interactions may contribute to the lower binding affinities, consistent with the fluorescence titration experiments (Figure 5). OleA binding to the S100A9 dimer does not perturb its α-helical secondary structure beyond the binding site, which is consistent with the CD measurements described above.

27,introduction27," The interactions involve multiple binding events due to the lack of specific OleA binding cavities on the S100A9 molecule (Figure 4C) similar to its interactions with other previously studied amyloidogenic polypeptides.24,26,29,32 Moreover, OleA can self-assemble into a larger species,40 which may also affect its apparent binding affinity. These were further supported by the similar binding of OleA with both native and amyloid S100A9 (Figure 5C).  OleA Alleviates S100A9 Induced Cytotoxicity Measured by the MTT Assay  The effect of OleA on the S100A9 cytotoxicity induced in the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line was studied by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay. Initially, neuroblastoma cells were treated for 24 h with various concentrations of S100A9 alone in either native or 48 h aged amyloid form (Figure S3A).

28,introduction28," 40–50% at 20 to 40 μM concentrations; native S100A9 also reduced the cell viability by ca. 20–30% at similar concentrations (Figure S3A).

All samples were prepared both without or with OleA at the following S100A9 to OleA molar ratios: 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10 (in monomeric equivalent).

We observed a decrease of the cytotoxic effect of the preformed S100A9 amyloids when they were treated with OleA at a 1:2 molar ratio of S100A9 to OleA from 1 to 48 h. This data suggests that after 48 h of coincubation OleA disassembles already formed S100A9 fibrils into nonfibrillar aggregates as shown in Figure 2C, that are no longer toxic. Such an inhibitory effect was also observed after shorter treatment times, suggesting that OleA likely makes the fibrils harmless by solvating them before inducing their collapse into unstructured aggregates.

32,introduction32,"44,45 Here, we examined whether OleA can act as a protective agent in these processes as well. Intracellular Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) levels were measured using the fluorescent probe CM-H2DCFDA (Figure 7B). In the cells exposed to native S100A9 as well as to the 24 and 48 h aged S100A9 amyloids, the Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) levels were increased by ca. 1.5-, 2.0-, and 2.8-fold, respectively, compared to untreated cells. Remarkably, the presence of OleA reduced Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) production in all cells exposed to both native and amyloid S100A9. The Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) level returned to the level of untreated cells at 1:5 and 1:10 ratios of S100A9 to OleA (Figure 7B).  We evaluated the changes of intracellular free Ca2+ levels in neuroblastoma cells treated with native S100A9 and S100A9 amyloids aged for 24 and 48 h using confocal microscopy with the Fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-3AM) Ca2+ indicator (Figure S3B).",4bd57f26-b7e9-4816-9f38-bc01a529f3be
33,introduction33," Native S100A9 did not cause an increase in the free Ca2+ level after the addition to SH-SY5Y cells from 10 to 60 min, while both aged amyloid samples led to a similar increase of intracellular Ca2+, which was manifested in Fluo-3AM fluorescence (Figure S3B). Therefore, in further experiments, only the 48 h aged S100A9 samples were used with increasing OleA concentrations (Figure 7C). When the cells were treated with a 1:1 molar ratio of S100A9 to OleA, Fluo-3AM fluorescence subsided significantly. Remarkably, it returned to the level of untreated cells when SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to the samples with 1:5 and 1:10 of S100A9 to OleA molar ratios. This is consistent with the protective effect of OleA observed by MTT cell viability and the Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) assays presented above (Figure 7A,B).",bbaf5b26-f137-40e0-b1dd-f0ba1f8b6f4d

The cells were exposed for 24 h to 20 μM S100A9 fibrils (equivalent of the monomer concentration). The differentiated cells appeared to be slightly more susceptible to the amyloid induced damage in terms of both cell viability and Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) production (Figure S5). In agreement with our unpublished data, the different cell susceptibility could be due to a different poly- and monosialic acid expression on the plasma membrane. However, in this paper, we focused on the undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells to compare our results with previously published studies.",4d5454ac-08b2-49b9-8778-9be62e05ff5a

Confocal imaging revealed that the amyloid assemblies were accumulated at the SH-SY5Y plasma membrane and colocalized with GM1 rafts (Figure 8A,E). Moreover, a strong Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) signal indicates close spatial localization and even direct interactions of the S100A9 amyloids with the membrane GM1 (Figure 8I). When the cells were subjected to S100A9 amyloids developed at increasing OleA concentrations, we observed both smaller clusters of aggregates on the cell membrane (Figure 6F–H) and a reduced Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) signal (Figure 8J–L).",fcc82c60-fe1a-4ba1-9564-38a9afa50e0b
37,introduction37," Furthermore, to assess the direct involvement of ganglioside GM1 in the binding of S100A9 amyloids to the cell membrane, we also conducted immunofluorescence experiments after treating the cells with the ganglioside synthesis inhibitor d-threo-1-phenil-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (d-PDMD). We found that the binding of S100A9 fibrils to membrane rafts was significantly reduced in cells depleted of GM1, following their treatment with d-PDMD (Figure 8M,N). These data support the conclusion that the binding sites of S100A9 amyloids to the cell membrane occur at the raft domains. These observations also suggest the critical role of GM1 in binding of S100A9 amyloids to the cell membrane, most likely due to the clusters of sialic acid moieties, producing negatively charged regions at the cell surface.",50d643fc-c6b1-484a-b129-34954df66b52

40,introduction40,"  Concluding Remarks  Here, for the first time, we have demonstrated that the most abundant polyphenol in olive oil, OleA, has multiple potencies in the inhibition of the amyloid self-assembly of pro-inflammatory protein S100A9 and mitigation of its damaging effect on neuroblastoma SH-SY5H cells. By directly interacting with native and fibrillar S100A9, OleA acts via multiple mechanisms and pathways to inhibit S100A9 amyloid aggregation; i.e., it prevents amyloid oligomerization and cross-β-sheet formation, reduces the effective rate of amyloid growth and the length of amyloid fibrils, and diminishes the overall amyloid load. Moreover, OleA is able to disintegrate already preformed fibrils of S100A9, converting them into nontoxic aggregates, which do not bind ThT dye, characteristic for cross-β-sheet amyloids.",e92c9124-1ca9-49a5-8b92-e834251d833a
41,introduction41," Furthermore, OleA targets S100A9 amyloids at the cellular membrane, protecting cells from amyloid cytotoxicity and amyloid-induced increased levels of Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) and free Ca2+. Since S100A9 is both a pro-inflammatory and amyloidogenic protein, OleA effectively mitigates the pathological consequences of the S100A9-driven amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascade in neurodegenerative diseases.9−11 Together with previously reported antiamyloid effects of OleA on other amyloidogenic polypeptides,25−33 the present findings further emphasize the beneficial properties of the Mediterranean diet in which olive oil is a central component.

To form amyloids, S100A9 was incubated in PBS, pH 7.4, at 42 °C. Previously, we have conducted extensive kinetics experiments on S100A9 amyloid formation at both 37 and 42 °C19 as well as at 55 °C.57 The scaling of the corresponding kinetics rate constants versus temperature illustrated that the mechanism of S100A9 amyloid self-assembly remained the same in this wide temperature range, which is below the thermal unfolding transition of S100A9, occurring above 60 °C.",4f4dc4f7-57b8-479c-a040-f32c8e30fcad
