0,methods0,"2.1. Study Population Sixty consecutive RA patients, diagnosed according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR)) classification criteria [29], were followed at the outpatient Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, S. Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome. All subjects gave their written informed consent before they participated in the study and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were receiving current therapy for at least three months and they were not taking steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and proton pumps inhibitors during the 2 weeks before the exams. Any patients on antibiotics, consuming probiotics, progestins or having a known history of inflammatory bowel disease and endocrinopathies were excluded.",8e9e9c46-41b4-42f8-9325-de0cbf8b5030
1,methods1,"  Demographic data, dietary and smoking habits, comorbidities, therapeutic regimen, disease activity score on 28 joints (DAS28), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)), C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides antibodies (anti cyclic citrullinated peptides antibodies (ACPA)) were also registered.  In each subject, weight and height were used to calculate the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) (weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2), kg/m2). The degree of obesity was established according to a scale based on body mass index (BMI) cut-off points: 18.5 < 25 kg/m2 normal weight, 25 ≤ 30 kg/m2 overweight, >30 kg/m2 obesity, respectively.",1e210432-8a58-435e-8bc4-0c8d4aa186ba
2,methods2," A validated 14-item questionnaire for the assessment of adherence to the Mediterranean diet Prevention with Mediterranean Diet-PREDIMED) [30] was recorded for all the enrolled subjects during a face-to-face interview between the patient and a rheumatologist. Briefly, each item was assigned score 1 and 0; PREDIMED score was calculated as follows: 0–5, low adherence; 6–9, moderate adherence; ≥10, high adherence.  2.2. Sample Collection and DNA Extraction First, 300 µL of fresh stool samples collected in a tube filled with a DNA stabilization buffer (Canvax Biotech, Cordoba, Spain) was processed for microbial genomic DNA extraction using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA concentration and purity were assessed by a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).  2.3.",61d6891d-5b1f-4763-aabb-320901059555
3,methods3," Next-Generation Sequencing of Bacterial 16S rRNA Gene  As routinely performed in our laboratory, the V3–V4 hypervariable regions of the bacterial gene encoding 16S ribosomal RNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) using barcoded universal primers [31]. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were purified, quantified and equimolar ratios of amplicons from individual samples were pooled before sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform using high throughput screening.   2.4. Bioinformatic Analysis Demultiplexed sequence data were analyzed using 16S Metagenomics GAIA 2.0 software, which performs quality control of the reads/pairs (i.e., trimming, clipping and adapter removal steps) through FastQC and BBDuk as previously reported [32]. The read pairs were mapped with BWA-MEM against the custom databases (based on NCBI) for taxonomy assignment. Alpha diversity index (Shannon) was also computed.",f018882f-57a2-4bc0-ba72-cbf41013efd5

Statistical Analysis Continuous data were described by median (25–75th percentil), while the categorical variables were described as percentages (%). The D’Agostino–Pearson test was used to test the normality of data. Fisher’s exact test was used for analysis of the contingency table, while the Mann–Whitney test was used to compare ranks. Using DAS28 as a dependent variable, a multiple linear regression analysis model was set up considering for multivariable analysis every variable with p < 0.05 in univariate analysis. Correlation analyses were performed using Spearman rank correlation.

5,methods5," Results were considered significant when p < 0.05.  3. Results Main demographic, anthropometric, and clinical characteristics of the RA patients are shown in Table 1.  3.1. Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and Clinical Characteristics of RA Patients Considering that only three patients had a low adherence score to the Mediterranean diet, we decided to divide the patients into two groups: low/moderate adherence (40 patients) and high adherence (20 patients).  As reported in Table 2, patients with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet had a significantly lower disease activity (p < 0.034) and C reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.037); on the other hand, they presented a significantly higher disease duration (p < 0.033) and a prevalence of the female gender (p< 0.023).   By using DAS28 as a dependent variable, we looked at possible associations between the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the main demographic, anthropometric and clinical parameters (i.e.",c51d36dc-5c79-4254-bb1e-66c07811fbfe

As reported in Table 3, the univariate analysis demonstrated an inverse correlation with the class of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (p < 0.047), smoking habit (p < 0.049) and body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.042) and a direct correlation with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (p < 0.016). Then, a multiple linear regression analysis model was set up considering for multivariable analysis every variable with p < 0.05 in univariate analysis. This approach confirmed the inverse correlation between the DAS28 and the Mediterranean diet (p < 0.042) and the direct correlation with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (p < 0.017).   3.2.",ebee5254-9d83-4672-b9e3-0182f06023d6
7,methods7," Microbiota Profile in RA Patients with Low/Moderate and High Adherence to Mediterranean Diet We next sought to evaluate any difference in fecal microbiota composition of RA patients based on whether they were adherent or not to the Mediterranean diet. On average, 164,475 ± 70,544 quality-filtered sequence pairs were generated per sample.   The calculation of diversity metrics at species level revealed that the Mediterranean diet had no significant impact on alpha-diversity as expressed by the Shannon index (Figure 1).  Concerning the microbial communities’ composition, the two diet groups exhibited a remarkable number of significant changes in each of the taxonomic levels analyzed. At phylum level (Figure 2A), Cyanobacteria were over-represented in high adherence compared to low/moderate adherence patients (0.010% vs. 0%), whereas the opposite was observed for Euryarchaeota (0.011% vs. 0.061%), Nitrospinae (0 % vs. 0.072%), Planctomycetes (0% vs. 0.011%), Tenericutes (0.044% vs. 0.",33ba201b-4b52-43f5-96ec-faea9765e21b

ZS2-15 (0% vs. 0.020%), Sutterella sp. 252 (0% vs. 0.076%) and Veillonella atypica (0% vs. 0.015%).  With the aim of establishing any association between microbial taxa and the adherence to the Mediterranean diet, correlation analyses were performed.  The Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed a direct association between high adherence to the Mediterranean diet and Enterococcaceae, whereas an inverse correlation was found with Methanobacteriaceae and Peptostreptococcaceae.",5a80fa9a-30d7-4f14-adb0-64a76ce43d6d
9,methods14," At genus level, a direct association was found with Coprobacillus, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, Marseillibacter and Tetragenococcus and an inverse correlation with Dorea, Methanobrevibacter, Romboutsia (Figure 4).  4. Discussion In this study, we tried to assess potential inverse associations between the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet and disease activity and identify possible correlations with the gut microbiota characteristics in RA patients. As hypothesized, the comparison between patients with high and low/moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet revealed that the first group had significantly lower disease activity expressed by the DAS28, and a lower level of systemic inflammation expressed by C reactive protein (CRP).",6f8f3a75-0dda-4619-a7fa-786a64eaa2a3
10,methods15," Furthermore, the univariate analysis demonstrated an inverse correlation between the DAS28 and the class of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a result confirmed by the multivariate analysis after adjustments for all the different demographic, anthropometric, clinical, and serologic variables. The protective role of the Mediterranean diet on disease activity of RA patients was supported by a healthy impact on microbiota composition.  In the last two decades, the advances in sequencing technologies have led to a growing awareness of the role played by the microbiota in the pathogenesis and outcome of autoimmune arthritis. It has also been suggested that the gut microbiota can be significantly modulated by different environmental factors such as diet, smoke, and therapy [1,10]. On the other hand, it has been reported, with contrasting results, that diet regimen can influence arthritis onset and outcome [20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29].",81a0e358-6376-4bd3-9da9-64df66b2dccf
11,methods16," Unlike the western diet, the Mediterranean diet is composed of a variety of foods and has been reported as the best-balanced and complete diet that provides antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and prebiotic effects [12,13]. The Mediterranean diet, indeed, is characterized by a significant amount of unrefined cereals, fruit, vegetables, legumes; a consistent intake of extra-virgin olive oil, fish; a moderate consumption of eggs, dairy products, alcohol and a low consumption of sweets and red meat [17]. Foods rich in fibers such as those assumed in the Mediterranean diet are mainly degraded by Firmicutes and Bacteroides into short chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as butyrate, which could have positive impact on gut dysbiosis by reducing intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, and limit inflammation [17,19]. By now, a few studies have specifically evaluated the effect of the Mediterranean diet on RA patients, with mostly inconclusive results.",792b8c28-ca12-4387-a074-4072e4909253
12,methods17," Two authors have failed to prove that adherence to the Mediterranean diet has a significant protective effect on the risk of RA development [33,34], whereas a more recent large population-based case–control study has revealed that the Mediterranean diet score was inversely associated with risk of RA onset [35]. However, this effect was observed only among men and seropositive patients, a subgroup not specifically analyzed in the previous studies. There is suggestive but insufficient evidence for a positive impact of the Mediterranean diet on RA-related outcomes (i.e., pain, physical function, disease activity), as reported by a 2009 Cochrane review and recently confirmed by two systematic reviews on the role of Mediterranean diet in RA patients [36,37,38]. In particular, a RCT found that a 12 week Mediterranean diet could reduce disease activity (mainly tender joints and general health) but was unable to rescue physical function or morning stiffness [39]. McKellar et al.",e748bc37-4971-4da9-9a4e-863d6cfbc419
13,methods18," compared written information and cooking classes as means of Mediterranean diet implementation in women with RA living in socially deprived areas, showing a modest improvement in a number of measures of disease activity [40]. Finally, a recent randomized crossover trial did not obtain a significant reduction in DAS28 with a Mediterranean anti-inflammatory diet plus probiotics in RA patients [41]. Diet habit is also strictly interconnected with the gut microbiota. The human digestive system for example cannot digest several plant-derived complex carbohydrates present in cereals, vegetables, and fruits that are degraded and fermented by intestinal bacteria [11]. It is known that the western diet, rich in animal protein and saturated fats, can enhance the Bacteroides enterotype, whereas the Prevotella-driven enterotype is prevalent in carbohydrate and fiber-based diet [11]. The effect of the Mediterranean diet on microbiota composition has been already reported in healthy subjects.",5b114524-8507-43fc-984e-75aab8c5ac14
14,methods19," Mitsou EK et al. showed that a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet was characterized by lower E. coli counts and increased levels of Candida albicans; moreover, a positive correlation of MedDietScore with total bacteria, bifidobacteria:E. coli ratio and relative share of Bacteroides and C. albicans was reported [17]. Considering that several abnormalities have been described in the gut microbiota of RA patients and that dietary habits can influence gut dysbiosis, diet has been suggested as a possible additional strategy for the management of these patients. However, we found only one study, performed in 2005, without using sequence analysis techniques, that focused on the effect of the Mediterranean diet on microbiota composition in RA patients [42]. These authors reported that neither the Mediterranean diet nor fasting treatments affect the intestinal flora in patients with RA.",570f29d9-f637-4fc4-9e03-22a31feb2fd8
15,methods20," More recently, we have found that a varied diet was inversely associated with Pasteurellales, Paraprevotellaceae, Paraprevotella, Blautia, Blautia coccoides, and Bacteroides eggerthii in RA patients; however, this was not the aim of that study, so diet habit was only generically assessed [9]. Profiling gut microbiota in RA patients with high and low/moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet, in our current study, revealed considerable differences between the two groups. Though not affecting alpha-diversity, in agreement with previous findings [43,44], high adherence to the Mediterranean diet considerably impacted on microbiota composition. A striking result was the drop, observed in high versus low/moderate adherence group, of Euryarchaeota phylum, which we previously found to be directly correlated with DAS [9]. Again, among the phyla, the Mediterranean diet promoted detection of Cyanobacteria, which were absent in low/moderate adherence patients.",4b071200-2799-4aaa-9ebe-e31400a1a6b5
16,methods21," As previously discussed, these bacteria can produce metabolic compounds endowed with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant properties, which could be beneficial for RA patients [9]. It is worth noting that at family level, there is the decreased abundance of Clostridiaceae in subjects following the Mediterranean diet, since this family has been found enriched and associated with the arthritis phenotype in RA patients [45]. Another intriguing observation is the significant under-representation of Lactobacillaceae (and its related genus Lactobacillus) and the inhibition of P. copri at species level, in the high adherence group, which can suggest a healthier gut microbiota composition. In fact, a significant increase in Lactobacillaceae in RA patients with respect to healthy controls has been previously reported, as well as in mice susceptible to developing collagen-induced arthritis [6,9,46]. P. copri has been shown to have a role in the autoimmune mechanism underlying RA onset.",f1bc40b7-e304-4a13-b7bb-a6961f1e1a62
17,methods22," Indeed, it was found enriched in the gut of newly-diagnosed RA patients [8]; moreover, an increased immunity towards P. copri was demonstrated in subjects suffering from RA and a sequence homology between disease-specific autoantigens and antigens from P. copri was described [47]. Together with an enrichment of P. copri in RA patients, Scher et al. also observed a lower abundance of Bacteroides fragilis [8], which is reported to induce regulatory T cells, a subset of T lymphocytes suppressing autoimmunity [48]. In our current study, high adherence to the Mediterranean diet produced a marked increase in B. fragilis abundance, which we speculate may benefit RA patients by suppressing autoreactivity and inflammation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the protective effect of adherence to the Mediterranean diet on disease activity in RA patients and its associations with the composition of the gut microbiota by using next-generation sequencing.",98835fde-7565-4776-a1a6-64ffee3421cc
18,methods23," The main limit of this study is the absence of a longitudinal analysis that does not permit inferring a certain cause–effect relationship between the Mediterranean diet, RA clinical outcome and gut dysbiosis. In conclusion, our findings suggest the protective role of the Mediterranean Diet on disease activity of RA patients supported by a healthy impact on microbiota composition. If confirmed by prospective studies on a larger population, these data underline the feasibility of adopting the Mediterranean diet as a supportive care to modulate the gut microbiota and improve disease activity on RA patients.
