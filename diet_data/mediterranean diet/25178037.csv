0,background0,"Classically, one of the objectives of the nutritional epidemiology has been to analyse the role of diet in the prevention of some non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) or cancer and little attention has been paid to the effect on other diseases such as mental disorders [1]. However, an emerging field of research is currently being developed and several links between nutrition and mental health are being established. There are a number of scientifically rigorous studies making important contributions to the understanding of the role of nutrition in mental health [2]. Specifically, some studies have pointed out that several dietary patterns could be associated with a reduced prevalence [3, 4] and a reduced risk of depression among adults [4–10]. This association seems to be consistent across countries, cultures and populations according to several systematic reviews and meta-analyses [11–13].",d02571e0-ff3f-4ff3-b6a4-f11d62c2e44d
1,background1," Among these previously described dietary patterns are the Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) [14], the Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)) [15, 16] and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)) [17].  Although the scientific report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has concluded that current evidence is limited, the protective dietary patterns associated with reduced risk of depression are those patterns emphasizing seafood, vegetables, fruits and nuts [18]. However, it is difficult to discern if differences in the intake of some micro- or macronutrients between these dietary patterns can make a difference in their association with a lower risk of depression.  Moreover, the type of association between adherence to these patterns and depression risk, and more specifically the shape of the dose–response curve and the potential existence of a non-linear threshold effect, has not yet been established.",2ba6258f-ef07-4bb0-94b8-9493759f682d
2,background2,"  For all of these reasons, the aims of this study were to compare the association of three diet quality scores with depression independently of their micro/macronutrients composition and to establish the type of relationship between these patterns and the risk of developing a depressive disorder within the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra/University of Navarra follow up (SUN) cohort study.

The aim of the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra/University of Navarra follow up (SUN) Project is to identify dietary and lifestyle determinants of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, coronary heart disease or depression, among other conditions. The participants of the study are former Spanish students of the University of Navarra, registered professionals from some Spanish provinces, and other university graduates. Baseline assessment and follow-up information is gathered through postal or web-based questionnaires collected every 2 years. Self-administered questionnaires include information regarding socio-demographic, lifestyle or dietary variables as well as the use of medication and the prevalence or incidence of different diseases during the follow-up.

Up to June 2014, 22,045 participants had completed the baseline questionnaire of the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra/University of Navarra follow up (SUN) Project. Participants who were lost to follow-up, who had not completed at least one follow-up questionnaire, who were outside of predefined limits for energy intake (less than 800 kcal/d or more than 4000 kcal/d in men and less than 500 kcal/d or more than 3500 kcal/d in women), and those who were users of antidepressant medication or had reported a previous clinical diagnosis of depression at baseline were excluded from the analyses. After exclusions, 15,093 participants were included in this study.  The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Navarra.

Nutrient intakes of 136 food items were calculated as frequency multiplied by nutrient composition of specified portion size for each food item, using an ad hoc computer program specifically developed for this aim. A trained dietician updated the nutrient database using the latest available information included in food composition tables for Spain [23].

8,methods5," One point was assigned to persons whose consumption was at or above the sex-specific median of six components in agreement with the traditional Mediterranean diet (vegetables, fruits/nuts, legumes, fish/seafood, cereals, and monounsaturated to saturated lipid ratio). The participant received also 1 point if her or his intake was below the median for the two components not in line with the traditional Mediterranean diet (meat or meat products and dairy products). For ethanol, 1 point was assigned only for moderate amounts of intake (5–25 g/d for women or 10–50 g/d for men). Therefore, this score could range from the highest possible (9 points reflecting maximum adherence) to the minimum possible (0 points reflecting no adherence at all). Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was categorized into five categories: low (score 0–2), low-moderate (score 3), moderate-high (score 4), high (score 5) and very high (6–9).",4705264c-c610-41aa-acb9-d1be920a928f
9,methods6," This categorization was used to ensure an adequate distribution of the sample with enough participants in each category of adherence.  Pro-vegetarian Dietary Pattern Because a pure vegetarian diet might not easily be embraced by many individuals, a moderate and intermediate approach to a vegetarian diet was proposed. This approach is the Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP), which was operationalized to quantify the habit of consuming preferentially plant-derived foods instead of animal-derived foods, but without the need to follow a strict vegetarian diet [24]. The Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP) represents a more easily understood message than a pure vegetarian diet.",b2050ef2-c5cf-4d5a-87de-60b39177cdb0
10,methods7," To build the Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP), we adjusted the consumption of seven food groups from plant origin (fruit, vegetables, nuts, cereals, legumes, olive oil and potatoes) and five food groups from animal origin (added animal fats, eggs, fish, dairy products, and meats and meat products) for total energy intake by using the residual method separately for men and women, and created quintiles. The final score could range from 12 (lowest adherence) to 60 (highest adherence). Finally, this quantitative variable was categorized into quintiles [24].  Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 To build the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, 11 groups of foods or nutrients were considered: vegetables, fruits, whole-grain bread, sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, nuts and legumes, red/processed meat, trans fatty acids, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, sodium, and alcohol intake [17].",b12115c8-184d-45bb-bfee-c069e594fedd
11,methods8," Although the original AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 includes the consumption of whole grains as one of its elements, its consumption is very scarce in the general Spanish population. In fact, almost the only source is a small amount of whole-grain bread that was considered as one of the elements in our score with nine categories of intake.  With the exception of whole-grain bread consumption, all AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 components were scored from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). Thus, the total AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 score could range from 0 (no adherence) to 109 (perfect adherence). This variable was categorized into quintiles.",9e1488e9-7566-4f99-80a1-015ad2e6e071
12,methods9,"  Outcome assessment Incident cases of depression were defined as participants who were free of depression and not using antidepressant treatment at baseline who, in any of the follow-up questionnaires (Q_2-Q_14), positively responded to the following question “Have you ever been diagnosed with depression by a medical doctor?” or who reported the habitual use of antidepressant drugs.  A self-reported physician-provided diagnosis of depression demonstrated acceptable validity in a subsample of 104 participants of our cohort, using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition as the ‘gold standard’ applied by experienced psychiatrists blinded to the answers to the questionnaires [25]. There were 46 true positives of the 62 self-reported cases of depression. Thus, the percentage of confirmed depression was 74.2 %; (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 63.3–85.1).",ee2693f3-4503-472f-be68-8de989df0c9c

Other covariate assessment Information on socio-demographic (e.g. sex, age, marital status, employment status) and lifestyle-related variables (e.g. smoking status, physical activity, use of vitamin supplements) were obtained from the baseline questionnaire (Q_0). Physical activity was assessed through a validated physical activity questionnaire with data about 17 activities [26]. Leisure-time activities were computed by assigning an activity metabolic equivalent score to each activity multiplied by the time spent in each activity, and summing up all activities. A participant was considered as a user of vitamin supplements if he or she reported at least the consumption of one of the following vitamin supplements: A, B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, B12, C, D or E.",a5038c2f-7102-4a01-a586-50ac40921d65

Other confounding factors such as marital status and employment status were also explored but not included in the final models because their inclusion in the regression models did not substantially change the reported associations.  As a sensitivity analysis, we also took into account the year of recruitment and introduced it as a stratifying factor.

The prevalence of diseases was updated using the information contained in any of the follow-up questionnaires.  To quantify the relationship between the adherence to different diet quality scores beyond the Mediterranean diet and depression, we fitted linear regression models with the Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP) and the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 dietary indexes as the dependent variables and adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) as the predictor.",c21bd7d9-257c-42ff-aa69-a77234b8ea72

Each z score was calculated as the score value minus the mean value for the score divided by standard deviation of the score.  Finally, the potential non-parametrical non-linear association between the cumulative average adherence to each of the dietary patterns and incident depression was calculated with restricted cubic splines [27].

Therefore, both exposures (residuals from these regressions) captured the variability in the respective scores (Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010) that were not explained by adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The most important reduction in the risk of depression associated with adherence to the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-10 could be explained by the correlation of this pattern with the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (HR for third quintile versus first quintile = 0.69; 95 % CI = 0.57–0.83).",63818488-268f-47b3-b2db-ab8358d243c2

28,discussion0,"The results of this study suggest that moderate or high adherence to diet quality scores such as the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), the Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP) or the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 could be effective for the reduction of depression risk. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that several dietary patterns reflecting overall diet quality have been compared in the same cohort in relation to depression risk, and non-linear associations explored.  We considered these three diet quality scores for multiple reasons. First, several studies have prospectively analysed the role of the Mediterranean diet in total mortality [28, 29] and in several diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) [30–32], T2DM [33, 34], hypertension (HTA) [35, 36] and even depression [4, 8–10].",7d02be70-a779-42c0-b7a9-2b9e4ebcd4c8
29,discussion1," Regarding the effect of the Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP), the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) study showed an inverse association between Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP) and total mortality [24]. With respect to the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, an inverse association was found with total, cardiovascular or cancer mortality [37] and with several diseases, such as T2DM [38], in a longitudinal analysis within the Multiethnic Cohort study.  Second, to our knowledge, there are no prospective studies that have analysed the contribution of the Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP) or the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 to the potential prevention of depression. Only a few studies have analysed the association between the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) or empirically-derived food patterns and depression. Pagoto et al.",ea66bcca-55e7-41f4-909f-56273158c59b
30,discussion2," found that higher scores in depressive symptoms collected through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale were associated with lower diet quality (measured through the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005) in a cross-sectional study among Latinos at risk of T2DM [39]. Regarding prospective studies, only a study by Akbaraly et al., also based on the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005, found a lower risk of depression associated with a higher adherence to the pattern, and only among women [5]. Those women who maintained or even improved their adherence to this dietary pattern along 10 years showed a significant reduction (around 65 %) in the risk of developing depressive symptoms as compared to those with low adherence.",29e23886-e375-4c8d-b6e0-ab4bd3df5d1c
31,discussion3," Other hypothesis-oriented patterns such as the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) have also been associated with lower depressive symptoms in cross-sectional studies [40, 41], whereas the results related with a posteriori patterns (empirically derived food patterns) have been inconsistent in both cross-sectional [7, 42] and longitudinal studies [7, 43, 44].  A third reason to analyse the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 is that we consider the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 to update previous indexes, such as the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005 or the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and to add new relevant information. In fact, the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005 and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 differ substantially in the items used in their scoring.",99928e5b-00c4-4d14-9a2e-507bc025ed8f
32,discussion4," For example, multivitamin use is not included in the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 whereas sodium or omega-3 fatty acid intake and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption are not considered in the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005 but are included in the 2010 version.  The protective role of several dietary patterns against chronic diseases including depression can be explained through their nutritional properties. The three dietary patterns analysed in this study negatively weighted food items such as meat, meat products and sweets (sources of animal fats: saturated and trans fatty acids). In contrast, several food items, such as nuts (source of omega-3 fatty acids), fruits, legumes and vegetables (source of vitamins and minerals), were positively weighted.",55e18126-1c22-4322-a976-6678917b943b
33,discussion5,"  In this context, although several prospective studies have recently associated the intake of some nutrients and food items such as trans fatty acids, sweets and bakery or fast food with an increased risk of developing depression [5, 6, 45, 46], other longitudinal studies that have analysed the role of the omega-3 fatty acids or the omega-3/omega-6 ratio [46–48] and some micronutrients such as B-vitamins and folate [49–52], vitamin E [53] or minerals such as magnesium [54] or zinc [55, 56] in depression prevention have reported inconsistent results. For example, although an inverse association was observed between omega-3 fatty acids intake and depression in a preliminary analysis within the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra/University of Navarra follow up (SUN) Project [48], no association was revealed in subsequent analysis with a longer follow-up period and a higher sample size [46]. While Tolmunen et al.",f81fb487-ce45-444f-a103-874e432d0cb4
34,discussion6," found that low dietary folate intake could be considered a risk factor for depression [52], recent longitudinal studies failed to find a significant association between folate or other B vitamin supplementation and depression incidence [49, 51]. Regarding magnesium intake, a cross-sectional study published by Jacka in 2009 reported an inverse association between magnesium intake and depressive symptoms [57] although reverse causality could explain the reported result. But, no statistically significant association between magnesium intake and depression risk was found in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra/University of Navarra follow up (SUN) cohort study in a prospective analysis [54]. Prospective cohort studies that have evaluated the role of zinc intake in depression risk also showed conflicting results.",e221bad3-d7e9-4fe0-b1b2-a7400c8f3662
35,discussion7," Whereas low dietary zinc intake was not longitudinally associated to depression in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study [55], an inverse and significant association was observed in two large longitudinal studies of middle-age and older Australians [56].  One possible explanation of the different magnitude of effect found for the three dietary patterns (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010) on depression risk is their distinct nutritional composition, differing in vitamin, mineral and macronutrient content. For example, as we have already mentioned above, all of them are important sources of vitamins and minerals (vegetables, fruits, nuts or legumes). However, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and fish (omega-3 fatty acids) and the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 in nutrients such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids).",857046da-84b0-486d-9262-01b9b17c0749
36,discussion8," Moreover, the consumption of fish (the most important source of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids) is negatively scored in the Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP). Finally, the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 takes into account sodium intake or the consumption of sugar- sweetened beverages.  One factor seems to be common to all the findings we observed. Moderate adherence (but not always the highest level of adherence) to diet quality scores showed the strongest inverse association with depression. It could be speculated that some psychological elements of neurotic or obsessive traits present in some participants classified in the highest category of dietary adherence may contribute to the observed plateau reached at moderate adherence.",74622746-890f-4d43-9180-ad8eb350b50b
37,discussion9," An alternative explanation for this plateau is that we observed suboptimal intakes for some micronutrients: vitamin E, folic acid and magnesium (below the recommended daily allowance) in participants within the first quintile of adherence to the three dietary patterns (Additional file 1: Table S1). Therefore, a threshold effect may exist, and once the threshold is achieved the risk reduction with subsequent improved adherence plateaued. This explanation is also compatible with our observed results. In fact, an accrual of studies based on patients with symptoms of depression has found suboptimal intakes of these micronutrients among these patients. Moreover, not only intake, but also low serum levels of folate, zinc or magnesium have also been associated with depressive symptoms in other cross-sectional studies [58–61].",9dbf628a-04b7-4563-81c1-5e0b39f9ea9b
38,discussion10,"  Finally, we have to highlight that, taking into account the observed correlation between the Mediterranean diet and the Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP), the Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP) showed additional and relevant information on the association between diet quality scores and depression risk, because the residuals of a regression of Pro vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PDP) on the Mediterranean diet were still significantly associated with depression risk. This was not the case for the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010. We observed a lower magnitude for the reductions in the risk of depression associated with the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 once we removed the variability in this score already explained by the Mediterranean diet.",67ed8280-3b59-4664-af50-eafb690d4a3a
39,discussion11," This latter finding suggests that common nutrients and food items present in both patterns (AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and the Mediterranean diet) could be responsible for the observed reduced risk in depression associated with a good adherence to the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010.  Some strengths of our study are its prospective design with a high retention rate; the inclusion of a large number of participants; the existence of published validation studies regarding some of the most important co-variables, including the exposure and the outcome; and the use of repeated measurements of the dietary patterns. Some limitations of our study should also be acknowledged. A self-reported dietary intake and a self-reported clinical diagnosis of depression were used to define the main variables of the analysis. Although both assessments were validated in subsamples of participants of the cohort [21, 25], some degree of misclassification might still exist.",a01d526f-d75f-4b77-af6a-a096f935b98a
40,discussion12," However, this misclassification is more likely to be non-differential, and therefore would bias the results towards the null. Another possible caveat might be inherent residual confounding because of the possibility that some confounding variables were measured imperfectly or with some error or that some unknown or unmeasured confounders related to lifestyle might also have biased our reported results. Finally, our participants are not representative of the general Spanish population. We restricted our cohort to highly educated participants to obtain a better quality of self-reported information, to improve the retention rate, and to minimize confounding by educational level, and therefore by socio-economic status.  Conclusions Better adherence to the three diet quality scores was associated with a reduced risk of depression among Spanish adults.",d02ea984-a821-4427-b527-4e0c5b7a0a75
41,discussion13," However, it seems that after eliminating the possible influence of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 shows a considerably weaker inverse association with depression risk. Interestingly, our observed dose–response relationships did not suggest a linear pattern. Instead, a threshold effect was apparent, with substantial risk reductions with moderate adherence compared to low adherence to quality dietary patterns, but almost no further extra benefit with subsequent improvements from moderate to maximum adherence. This dose–response pattern is compatible with the hypothesis that suboptimal intake of some nutrients (mainly located in low adherence levels) may represent a risk factor for future depression. More studies analysing the role of the adequacy of nutrient intake to meet neurophysiological requirements and the role of suboptimal levels of micronutrients in depression risk are needed to explore this possible dose–response pattern.",bcc51d22-1a39-43e9-a0f0-b038dfdd3d39
42,discussion14," Also, further large prospective studies and trials to confirm this hypothesis are needed to provide effective population strategies for using dietary patterns in the prevention of depression.
