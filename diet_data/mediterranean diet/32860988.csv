0,introduction0," Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, and multifactorial disease, and it is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States (US), closely behind tobacco use [1]. The obesity epidemic continues to be on the rise, posing a high burden on the population health and economy, with estimated annual medical expenses approaching 150 billion dollars [2]. It is estimated that by 2030, more than half of the US population will be considered obese [3]. In addition to being associated with numerous pathological conditions including cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity also exerts a significant toll on gastrointestinal (GI) disorders [4]. Obesity-related GI disorders such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)) are frequently encountered in gastroenterology clinics [5].",30a2a6bb-d3c2-4232-b521-f4f152a32d3e
1,introduction1," These disorders are considered more frequent and present earlier than cardiovascular disease (CVD) and T2DM, thus providing an opportunity for gastroenterologists to intervene early with an effective weight loss therapy [5].  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent cause of chronic liver disease, affecting 25% of the world population and over 30% of the US population [6]. The increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its bidirectional relationship with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and components of the metabolic syndrome pose a significant economic burden with over $103 billion per year in direct costs and about $908 billion 10-year economic burdens for the management of disease-related complications [6,7]. Lifestyle modifications including weight loss and physical activity remain the cornerstone for the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [4,6].",a8a53ed3-7dcb-4203-bbc6-4d8c2f3c777d
2,introduction2," However, given the complexity of obesity management, patient-directed efforts to lose weight after physician advice are usually unsuccessful, evidenced by the increasing prevalence of obesity [8]. Therefore, a structured medically supervised weight management program with regular follow-up visits is likely to be more effective [8]. Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of structured weight management programs combined with regular physical activity in the management of obesity-related gastrointestinal disorders, namely, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [9,10]. These interventions may be achievable in a controlled trial setting. However, they are considered challenging in a community-based clinical setting due to the lack of formal training of healthcare providers in effective weight loss methods [10,11].",c4fb32c0-7611-4b28-896a-e70573f1be0e
3,introduction3,"  The American Gastroenterological Association (American Gastroenterological Association (AGA)) developed practice guidance entitled “POWER: Practice Guide on Obesity and Weight Management,” which introduces gastroenterologists to effective obesity management in their routine practices [5]. This practice guide was used in designing the weight management program at our community-based gastroenterology practice [12]. The program is comprised of a multiphasic dietary intervention, a recommended medical fitness program, and weekly behavioral support groups. The main goal of the program is to achieve a 10% total body weight (total body weight (TBW)) loss at three months, which is a known determinant for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) regression [13]. We hypothesized that a multifaceted, community-based, gastroenterologist-supervised weight management program is a more effective weight loss strategy than patient-directed weight loss efforts after physician advice.",3f045549-ea19-43bc-9c15-f385e801c393

Patients are followed on monthly basis and slowly transitioned to a whole food plant-based or Mediterranean diet after three months of participation. Patients’ weight trends driven by self-directed efforts to lose weight after physician advice were collected based on historical data up to two years prior to program participation.

The weight management program is conducted at Huron Gastroenterology Associates, a community-based practice located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The weight management team consists of three gastroenterologists, three physician assistants, a weight loss navigator, a medical assistant/data analyst, a registered dietician, and a registered nurse educator. The program is a three-phase dietary intervention; phase 1 consists of a strict very-low-calorie meal replacement diet for three months (Optifast, Nestle Health Sciences, Florham Park, NJ, USA; nutritional content (800 kcal/day): fat 19.4% kcal; carbohydrate 43.4% kcal; fiber 3.5% kcal; and protein 33.",36e25cc3-d62c-45a4-9de3-ba7dda902beb

Figure 1 Weight management program components  Details on the development and specifics of the program components have been previously published [12]. Eligible patients were obese adults (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m2) aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), no history of excessive alcohol consumption (>21 drinks per week for men and >14 drinks per week for women over a two-year period), or evidence of other causes of chronic liver disease [15].",253ce7c3-cbc0-4adb-b9dd-20a0ac99f49e

Compliance with the meal replacement diet was self-reported by patients during their regular follow-up visits.  Patients’ weight trends based on self-directed efforts to lose weight through diet modification and physical exercise after physician advice were collected by reviewing historical data for each patient included in the cohort up to two years prior to participation in the weight management program.

19,discussion0," A multifaceted, community-based gastroenterologist-supervised weight management program with a behavioral intervention was effective in achieving a 10% total body weight (TBW) loss in 65% of participants at three months. Additionally, improvement in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and T2DM as demonstrated by symptom improvement and/or medication reduction was noted in 52% and 38% of patients with these conditions, respectively. Within the same cohort of patients, the program was significantly more effective at achieving weight loss than patient-directed efforts in the years preceding program participation. Participants who attended support groups ≥ 50% of the time had a 3% higher total body weight (TBW) loss at three months compared with patients who attended < 50% of the time. This study emphasizes the role of gastroenterologists in the multidisciplinary treatment of obesity in accordance with the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recommendations [5].",deae2086-99de-4305-a159-200213b291ca
20,discussion1," Patient-directed efforts during the previous years were ineffective in achieving any clinically significant weight loss, suggesting physician participation is a key determinant to success [8,11].  Gastroenterologists are not uniformly trained in effective weight loss techniques during their training [17]. Nonetheless, the providers participating in this study were able to facilitate effective weight loss in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, despite not having formal training in bariatric care. This was achieved using an algorithmic team-based approach, utilizing a dietician, a nurse educator, a data analyst, and a weight loss navigator. In addition, one of the program’s strengths lies in the ability to implement and reproduce this experience at other community-based gastroenterology practices [12].  The effectiveness of multifaceted behavioral weight management programs has been widely described in the literature [18-21].",86514941-b199-45e1-816d-cbebfc18d06a
21,discussion2," However, much of the available evidence is derived from clinical trials that are conducted in a controlled setting under the supervision of experienced researchers at academic institutions. Our study suggests that incorporating this model in a community-based gastroenterology practice is achievable and is equally effective. Using a meal replacement product initially for up to three months was found to be effective in promoting patient compliance and eliminated the need for patients to abruptly change their eating patterns of prepared food. During the meal replacement period, intensive educational efforts were implemented to teach patients about the importance of fiber-rich, low glycemic index diets in preparation for transition to solid foods. Further emphasis was made on whole food - plant-based and Mediterranean diets - given the supportive evidence of their efficacy in long-term weight loss, improved glycemic control, and cardiovascular benefits [22,23].",237b4e7c-6fa4-4184-a2b4-800b3e006ff6
22,discussion3,"  Behavioral interventions have been consistently demonstrated as an important facet of any weight management program associated with long-term success as it improves dietary compliance and weight maintenance and prevents weight regain [24-27]. The behavioral and educational efforts in our program were delivered through face-to-face meetings, which were also live-streamed on Facebook® for patients who were unable to attend in person. The educational programs were also recorded and could be played back at the patient’s convenience. Findings from this study reinforce the importance of behavioral interventions as those patients who participated in the weekly behavioral support groups ≥ 50% of the time achieved a 3% higher total body weight (TBW) loss than those who did not.  Hepatic steatosis reversal can occur rapidly with lifestyle modifications. Reginato et al. evaluated the effects of short-term intensive lifestyle intervention on HSI in adults with obesity and/or T2DM [28].",39ca4dcc-4ac0-4e91-b167-d14489a2dd49
23,discussion4," This study showed that after three months of intensive lifestyle intervention, mean HSI significantly decreased from 45.7 to 43.4 (p < 0.001), while mean BMI decreased from 34 to 33.1 kg/m2 (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, Koutoukidis et al. performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association of weight loss interventions with changes in biomarkers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [8]. The meta-analysis showed that more intensive weight loss interventions were significantly associated with a greater weight change (-3.61 kg; 95% CI, -5.11 to -2.12; I2 = 95%) when compared with no or lower intensity weight loss interventions. The aforementioned weight loss interventions were also associated with improvements in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) biomarkers, including alanine aminotransferase (-9.81 U/L; 95% CI, -13.12 to -6.50), histologically or radiologically measured liver steatosis (standardized mean difference: -1.48; 95% CI, -2.27 to -0.",b8eedab8-c7d1-474d-9097-8604c9917a4d

Most of the included studies were of short- to medium-term duration (median of six months). Based on these findings, the authors of the meta-analysis identified the need to change the clinical guidelines to recommend formal weight management programs for patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The program instituted in our study may be an effective way to enact this recommendation.  Gastroenterologists have an opportunity to address obesity and provide effective therapy as it is considered a major modifiable cause of digestive tract diseases that routinely go unaddressed such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [5].",03f3f65c-eaf7-453f-97d7-29aa8d364665
25,discussion6," Our study is consistent with the literature and demonstrates the effectiveness of a gastroenterologist-supervised weight management program that can be implemented at a community-based level and conducted by healthcare personnel in everyday routine practice. A recent study conducted by Malespin et al. found that only 32% of overweight or obese adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) receiving usual care in the US achieved ≥5% total body weight (TBW) loss during a median follow-up of 39 months [29]. Therefore, the ability of our program to achieve a 10% total body weight (TBW) loss in 65% of patients who presented for their three-month follow-up office visit is encouraging, not to mention the additional benefits of the program demonstrated by the improvement in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and T2DM disease status in 52% and 38% of patients with these conditions, respectively.",038c17ff-1f2e-4eff-b38e-e25ad707f466
26,discussion7," However, it should be noted that comorbid conditions such as hypertension and T2DM were relatively higher in patients who lost <10% total body weight (TBW) compared with those who lost ≥10% total body weight (TBW). This observation suggests that pre-existing comorbidities may play a role in the weight management program's efficacy and patients' tendency to lose weight.  Our study’s main limitation is the irregularly spaced and non-standardized follow-up visits, which resulted in inconsistent data gathering and the inability to adequately assess our retention rates. However, this is an expected limitation of a weight management program implemented at a community-based practice, given the complex logistics of enforcing mandated follow-up visits in the absence of a clinical trial. We also noticed that some of our patients prefer less frequent follow-up visits once they have achieved their target weight loss goal.",303c8ca2-5714-43cb-9d2b-77b548fb54a4
27,discussion8," However, the majority of these patients are still in contact with our program either through attendance of behavioral support groups or through direct communication with our weight loss navigator via phone, text, or email, suggesting their desire for continued engagement with the program. Moreover, out of the 208 patients who presented for their baseline office visit, 36 patients (17.3%) opted not to pursue the program, and 58 patients (27.9%) did not complete three months of follow-up. This relatively high drop-out rate is another expected limitation of our community-based weight management program, which may be related to the very low-calorie diet (800 kcal/day) adopted in the initial phase of the program.  Other limitations of the study include the small sample size and the lack of a comparison group where only behavioral support is provided without meal replacement.",86c10654-3748-442c-b131-c7d10be115b5
28,discussion9," In addition, the retrospective nature of the study limited our ability to collect dietary and exercise compliance data and biomarkers for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) due to missing lab values. Furthermore, there are limits to the study's generalizability as the majority of patients were non-Hispanic White (90.3%), which is reflective of the practice's local community demographics. Finally, we were unable to assess our six months data by the end of the study period due to the inconsistent range of follow-up visit dates and missing data after the first three months. Hence, it is unclear if the results achieved at three months can be maintained for six to 12 months. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that patients who continue to engage in our educational programs for over a year are likely to maintain their weight loss.",f10f48bc-b3b8-4ce8-a50f-dbd54ceeaaef
29,discussion10," Quality improvement of the weight management program is ongoing and aims to address these limitations through utilizing telehealth services to ensure more regular follow-up visits that can assess long-term outcomes [30].  Conclusions  A multifaceted, community-based, gastroenterologist-supervised weight management program is effective in addressing obesity-related gastrointestinal disorders including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), through achieving a clinically significant total body weight (TBW) loss of at least 10%. Incorporating a behavioral component into the program plays a vital adjunctive role in program success. Most importantly, the program can be implemented and reproduced at other community-based gastroenterology practices. Further larger scale and well-executed community-based studies are needed to determine the sustainability of this weight loss over one year.",e0de6def-8898-4bcf-99cd-6b81435ca7c9
