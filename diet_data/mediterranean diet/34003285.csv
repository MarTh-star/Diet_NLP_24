0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design  The present work is an ancillary study of the Intervention (INTERAPNEA) randomized clinical trial [37], conducted from April 2019 to October 2020. Detailed information on the study rationale, design, and methodology has previously been published [37]. This trial is in compliance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)), was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committees of the University of Granada (Granada, Spain), Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital (Granada, Spain), and Junta de Andalucía (Spain) (0770-N-19), and is registered in the National Institutes of Health database (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03851653).  2.2. Participants  Participants were recruited from the sleep-disordered breathing unit of the collaborating hospital (Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital).",719f5597-fe40-4d7b-9cdf-7bf786f52cca
1,methods1," Potential participants were men aged 18–65 years with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)-treated moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (i.e., AHI equal or greater than 15 events per hour of sleep) and a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) equal to or greater than 25 kg/m2. The sole inclusion of men in our sample was not only based on the higher incidence and prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in this population [1], but also on the well-evidenced differences between men and women in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) phenotypes [38] and the effectiveness of weight loss interventions [20,37,39,40,41]. Exclusion criteria included present participation in a weight loss program, presence of any psychological/psychiatric disorder, and/or any other primary sleep disorder which was not secondary to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).",1129a246-8faf-4be1-b8f0-d48f5d15d9c3
2,methods2," Upon providing written informed consent, potential participants were clinically/physically examined to ensure feasibility of inclusion in the study. Successively, screening/baseline measurements, including an overnight fasting blood test, complete full-night polysomnography, a set of questionnaires measuring subjective variables, and measurements of body composition and anthropometric parameters, were conducted on each participant. The trial was conducted in three consecutive sets of ~30 participants. A total of 89 men were finally randomly assigned to either the intervention group (40 participants) or the usual-care group (49 participants) by means of a computer-generated simple (unrestricted) randomization (Figure 1). The 8-week assessment (intervention endpoint) was completed by 75 participants, 15.7% (14 participants) being lost at follow-up, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic (10 participants).  2.3.",8a959337-ae69-430d-96d8-e704baf18126
3,methods3," Interventions  The interdisciplinary weight loss and lifestyle intervention was precisely designed following the latest clinical practice guidelines for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [17,18] and obesity management [42,43]. It lasted eight weeks and was composed of five components: nutritional behavior change; moderate-intensity aerobic exercise; smoking cessation; alcohol avoidance; and sleep hygiene. Participants received 60–90 min sessions weekly per component, each session being led by qualified personnel in the field (i.e., human nutrition and dietetics, physical activity and sport sciences, psychology, and sleep medicine).",87cfa35a-9478-4cd1-b79d-0d4e0dc4b968
4,methods4," Briefly, the cornerstone of this interdisciplinary intervention was the use of the Transtheoretical Model of Health Behavior Change [44], a well-recognized biopsychosocial model based on integrating key strategies, processes, and principles of behavior change theories into a comprehensive interventional approach for the achievement of sustainable health-related behaviors. Consciousness raising, self-reevaluation, stimulus control, goal-setting, self-monitoring, and self-efficacy were some of the behavioral change processes and strategies used. Details of the content of the intervention have previously been published [37].  The usual-care/control group received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, together with a single session of 30 min addressing general advice on weight loss and lifestyle change. Nevertheless, the weight loss and lifestyle intervention was offered to all participants from this group at trial completion.  2.4.",eccf246c-28d3-43a1-b44b-3cd71ecbaadc
5,methods5," Assessments  Assessments at baseline, intervention endpoint, and 6 months after intervention were completed over a one to two-week period, including a fasting blood test, a full-night ambulatory polysomnography, a set of questionnaires, and a full-body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) scanner. All participants were instructed to refrain from using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for 7 days before each study assessment. A complete description of the Intervention (INTERAPNEA) trial assessments, including detailed information on the polysomnography performed and other tests and measures, can be found in a previously published paper [37].",c15408de-da67-4406-b076-69a17ed6f8f2
6,methods6,"  The primary outcomes of this study were changes from baseline to intervention endpoint and 6 months after intervention in self-reported dietary behavior, as measured by the Food Behavior Checklist (Food Behavior Checklist (FBC)) questionnaire [45], and adherence to the Mediterranean diet, which was assessed through the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) [46].  The Food Behavior Checklist (FBC) is composed by 22 items and seven sub-scales related to fruit and vegetables consumption (nine items), milk/dairy consumption (two items), food security (one item), diet quality (four items), fast food consumption (three items), sweetened beverages consumption (two items), and meat consumption (one item). Scores range from 23 to 85, higher scores indicating healthier dietary behavior.",b9d44500-bc1f-42d8-8d21-e2678a01d5a6
7,methods7,"  Similarly, the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) is a widely used 14-item screener to assess adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern through questions related to food intake habits and food consumption frequency. Total scores range from 1 to 14, higher scores indicating greater compliance with the Mediterranean diet. Scores equal or greater than 10 indicate high adherence to the Mediterranean diet.  Objective sleep outcomes included in this study were AHI, defined as the number of apnea and hypopnea episodes per hour of sleep, oxygen desaturation index, which is the number of oxygen desaturation ≥3% per hour of sleep, and sleep efficiency (%), calculated as the ratio of total sleep time to total time in bed. These sleep outcomes were measured through a full-night in-laboratory polysomnography.",c1c5f747-2700-41ce-8cac-24a65115c551
8,methods8,"  Body weight and composition outcomes included body weight (kg), which was measured with a calibrated scale and stadiometer (model 799, Electronic Column Scale, Hamburg, Germany); neck, chest, and waist circumferences (cm); and fat mass (kg) and visceral adipose tissue (g), which were measured through a full-body dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner (Discovery Wi, Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA).  2.5. Statistical Analysis  Linear mixed-effects models [47] were used in order to estimate intervention effects on the study outcomes. These models included group, assessment time, and their interaction terms, estimations being conducted through the restricted maximum-likelihood method and an unstructured covariance matrix adjusting for within-participant clustering resulting from the repeated-measures design. All values presented in the tables are model-based estimates, this model assuming that missing values were missing-at-random.",b3517790-3311-43f8-afe7-827b4eed08d5
9,methods9," Nevertheless, a logistic model predicting attrition propensity based on baseline values of set of participants, trial group, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity, age, and body mass index (BMI) was used. Only set of participants predicted attrition due to the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic at the trial endpoint, which was the intervention endpoint assessment of the third set of participants.  Analyses and estimations were performed with both an intention-to-treat approach (including all participants as originally allocated after randomization) and a per-protocol approach restricted to participants with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) usage equal or greater than four hours per night on 70% of nights and, regarding the intervention group, at least 80% of attendance rate at intervention sessions.",832b07a6-7dd6-4b2d-b1d3-f19f0b980763
10,methods10,"  In addition, association of changes in dietary behavior over time with changes in sleep and body weight and composition outcomes were examined by repeated measures correlation analysis—a statistical technique used to determine the within-individual association for paired measures assessed on two or more occasions for multiple individuals [48]. All analyses were performed using R version 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing; Boston, MA, US).  3. Results  3.1. Participants’ Characteristics  Baseline characteristics of the study participants by group are presented in Table 1. The majority of participants enrolled were middle-aged men (mean ± SD age, 54.1 ± 8.0 years), with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (mean ± SD AHI, 41.3 ± 22.2 events/h) and obesity (mean ± SD body mass index (BMI), 34.4 ± 5.4 kg/m2). There were no significant between-group differences in any of the baseline values.  3.2.",bb193832-2010-40bb-a141-0ce5c853e120
11,methods11," Changes in Dietary Behavior  There was a significantly improvement in dietary behavior in the intervention group than in the control group, with a mean between-group difference in Food Behavior Checklist (FBC) total score of 8.7 (95% CI, −5.7 to −11.7; p < 0.001) and 7.7 (95% CI, −4.4 to 10.9; p < 0.001) from baseline to intervention endpoint and 6 months after intervention, respectively (Table 2 and Figure 2). Correspondingly, participants in the intervention group also significantly reduced consumption of sweetened beverages (p < 0.05), increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (p < 0.001), and, thus, enhanced diet quality (p < 0.001) (Food Behavior Checklist (FBC) subscales). Similar results were obtained using the per-protocol approach (Table S1).",1dd9da8e-1c4d-4492-9ae3-9fb4963032d6
12,methods12," According to changes from intervention endpoint to 6 months after intervention, participants in the intervention group preserved improvements in these dietary behavior and diet quality outcomes, although a slight reduction in fruits and vegetables consumption was found (Table S2 and Figure S1).  Regarding adherence to the Mediterranean diet, participants in the intervention group also had a greater increase in the compliance with the Mediterranean diet, as measured by Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) at both intervention endpoint and 6 months after intervention, with mean between-group differences of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.9; p < 0.001) and 1.7 (95% CI, 0.9 to 2.6; p < 0.001), respectively (Table 2 and Figure 2). Similar results were obtained using the per-protocol approach (Table S1). Improvements in the adherence to the Mediterranean diet at the intervention endpoint were maintained 6 months after intervention (Table S2 and Figure S1).  3.3.",b7821c14-37a7-4228-b4d4-6e4a0442704a
13,methods13," Association of Changes in Dietary Behavior over Time with Changes in Sleep and Body Weight and Composition Outcomes  Changes in dietary behavior over time as measured by Food Behavior Checklist (FBC) total score were significantly associated with changes in sleep outcomes; an increase in Food Behavior Checklist (FBC) total score being related with reduced AHI and oxygen desaturation index and increased sleep efficiency (all p ≤ 0.001; Table 3 and Figure 3). With regards to body composition and anthropometric outcomes, changes over time in Food Behavior Checklist (FBC) total score were inversely associated with changes in body weight, fat mass, visceral adipose tissue, and neck, chest, and waist circumferences (all p < 0.001; Table 3 and Figure 4 and Figure 5).",9c7003a2-bbd7-4aef-af37-ceaf32b83746
14,methods14,"  Similarly, changes over time in adherence to the Mediterranean diet as measured by Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) total score were significantly associated with changes in sleep outcomes, an increase in Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) total score being related to reduced AHI and oxygen desaturation index and increased sleep efficiency (all p < 0.001; Table 3 and Figure 3). Increases over time in Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) total score were also associated with reductions in body weight, fat mass, visceral adipose tissue, and neck, chest, and waist circumferences (all p < 0.001; Table 3 and Figure 4 and Figure 5).  4.",52654199-5685-49ff-8d19-aff7abfb0e45
15,methods15," Discussion  The present study demonstrates that an eight-week interdisciplinary weight loss and lifestyle intervention, incorporating not only a nutritional behavior change component but also increased physical activity, sleep hygiene, and alcohol and tobacco avoidance is effective at significantly improving dietary behavior in men with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)-treated moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and overweight/obesity. According to the results reported herein, the weight loss and lifestyle intervention group had 20% and 15% increases in healthful dietary behavior as measured by Food Behavior Checklist (FBC) at intervention endpoint and 6 months after intervention, respectively. Similarly, participants from this group reported 33% and 25% increases at intervention endpoint and 6 months after intervention, respectively, in adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as measured by Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS).",0e9ffcfd-8013-4c1f-b8ad-46360a38a94a
16,methods16," Importantly, these improvements in dietary behavior and increases in adherence to the Mediterranean diet over time were closely related to improvements in sleep, body composition, and anthropometric outcomes.  These results are consistent with the limited existing evidence supporting the beneficial effects of behavioral weight loss interventions promoting nutritional education and behavior change on dietary behavior, diet quality, and/or adherence to the Mediterranean diet [29,30,31,32,33]. Patnode et al. [29], in a systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, found that healthful diet interventions in adults without known cardiovascular disease risk factors were related to reduced total energy and saturated fat intake and increased fiber and fruits and vegetables consumption. Similarly, a systematic review by Lin et al.",cc3de004-3527-49c8-b4f4-1888c746a968
17,methods17," [30,31], based on a large body of evidence (76 trials), also determined that an intensive combined lifestyle counseling significantly improved dietary behavior in participants with cardiovascular disease risk factors.  Studies exploring the effects of these dietary and/or lifestyle approaches on dietary patterns and quality of the diet in adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are currently lacking. Most previous studies in this regard only included calorie-restricted diets [25], which, as shown by the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study [49]—the largest randomized trial in this field of research — may not be the most-efficient approach for diet quality and sustainable dietary behavior change [26,27]. According to corroborative evidence, caloric restriction may result in compensatory changes that cause increased hunger and, in turn, increased energy intake as a homeostatic response to fat loss [26,50].",7e4ba436-e7a2-42b2-91b5-5205536c23d6
18,methods18," Furthermore, caloric restriction has also been associated with a compensatory reduction in energy expenditure that prevents weight loss in the long term [50]. Most importantly, this approach is not focused on changing dietary patterns and diet quality in the long term, which are the key factors for weight loss and benefits maintenance.  The current study is the first to report the beneficial effects of an interdisciplinary weight loss and lifestyle intervention on dietary behavior and the association of these changes with changes in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity and related outcomes in adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Remarkably, those participants who achieved healthier dietary behavior and greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet also exhibited lower obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity, greater weight loss, and enhanced body composition and anthropometric parameters.",3a1cb9e0-225e-4023-a43e-de7f97cfa332
19,methods19," Therefore, nutritional education and behavior change, focusing on macronutrients intake and promoting the Mediterranean diet, is an important intervention component to be considered and included in weight loss and lifestyle interventions for the management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The Mediterranean diet has been shown to have greater long-term beneficial effects on weight status and waist circumference than low-fat and calorie-restricted diets among individuals with type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors [51]. In adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the Mediterranean diet has also been shown to be related with reductions in body weight and abdominal fat, which is associated with reductions in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity [28].",b22352ed-aa8b-402f-ad4b-25421244c094
20,methods20," Furthermore, given its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, the Mediterranean diet may potentially combat the inflammation and oxidative stress found in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), thereby improving the upper-airway neuromuscular control and muscle force-generating capacity and thus preventing the occurrence of the upper-airway obstructions during sleep [26].  The main strength of the current study is the design and implementation of a novel interdisciplinary weight loss and lifestyle intervention readily adaptable to real-world clinical practice. Another notable strength is the measurement of sleep and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity through a full-night in-laboratory polysomnography—the gold-standard for the measurement of these outcomes—at each study assessment (baseline, intervention endpoint, and 6 months after intervention).",0643ee5c-ac81-42fe-8308-c20da04c6829
21,methods21," Nevertheless, a limitation of the study design is the sole inclusion of men with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and overweight/obesity in our sample, which restricts the generalization of our findings. Furthermore, the study duration may have not been sufficient to determine long-term intervention effects and benefits maintenance. Another limitation is the subjective assessment of dietary behavior and adherence to the Mediterranean diet through the Food Behavior Checklist (FBC) and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), which, although widely used, are self-reported questionnaires. Therefore, future well-designed studies, including women, longer-term follow-ups, and objective dietary behavior assessments are needed.  5.",dd268001-6429-48be-8097-87771ef6053a
22,methods22," Conclusions  In conclusion, in this study involving men with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and overweight/obesity, an eight-week interdisciplinary weight loss and lifestyle intervention, including dietary behavior change, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, sleep hygiene, and tobacco and alcohol avoidance, was related to significant improvements in dietary behavior and adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Given the beneficial effects of dietary behavior change interventions and the Mediterranean diet on weight loss and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity, approaches including these dietary components should be the strategy of choice for the comprehensive management of this increasingly common sleep-disordered breathing.
