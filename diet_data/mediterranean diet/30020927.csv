0,methods0,"4.1. Patient Cohort  The Mediterranean Diet in Northern Ireland (MEDiterranean Diet in Northern Ireland (MEDDINI)) study was a pilot randomised controlled parallel group trial where 61 willing participants previously diagnosed with coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) were recruited (samples from n = 58 participants were available for the present study) from the Cardiology Directorate, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast. Patients recruited were aged between 39 and 78 years and had a recent diagnosis (within four weeks prior to starting the study) of myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina.",189dd376-417c-464e-817d-321842e6864a
1,methods1," Patients with severe heart failure, pending on immediate inpatient coronary revascularisation, on warfarin therapy, on Omacor therapy, with cognitive impairment, those with records of extreme alcohol intake, taking multivitamin/fish oil supplements, unable to comply with the diet or to provide informed consent or those who were not expected to live longer than 6 months for any other causes were excluded from the study [13].  Plasma samples and dietary assessment measurements were collected at three-time points; baseline, 6 months and 12 months. Seven-day food diaries were used to collect food consumption data. Participants were asked to record the foods consumed over seven consecutive days, including an estimation of quantity consumed and information on preparation methods used. From seven-day food diaries, a database was created registering all food amounts eaten by all participants during the course of the intervention (baseline, 6 months and 12 months).",2cd465bf-26e2-4b6e-a733-394ec7806e35
2,methods2," 17 selected food groups from this database were used to correlate with shortlisted biomarkers (Supplementary Materials Table S1). Fasting blood samples were collected at the three time points to assess nutritional biomarkers. Ethical approval was obtained for this study from the Queen’s University Belfast Research Ethics Committee (ethical approval references: RGHT000049 and 15.42 for the Meddini original study and for the latest analysis respectively. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants [13].  The baseline characteristics of the sampled cohort (average body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, age, sex and smoking characteristics) can be found in the Supporting information (Supplementary Materials Table S2). Mean age was 56.1 years for the low Mediterranean diet score (MDS) group and 60.5 y for the high Mediterranean diet score (MDS) group, and participants were on a range of medications. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 30.",9db3329f-30ec-470b-a234-75905f6d33d0
3,methods3,"2 kg/m2 for the low Mediterranean diet score (MDS) group and 29.8 for the high Mediterranean diet score (MDS) group, which indicated that patients were mostly overweight/obese.   4.2. MD Scoring Adherence to the MD was originally measured using a nine-point item scale, which has previously been validated [40] and consisted of a brief questionnaire for assessing adherence to MD and obtaining a rapid feedback. However, to include and control a wider range of food features of MD, adherence to an MD was rescored using the validated 14-point Mediterranean diet score (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)) based on the PREDIMED score, where a score of 0 indicates lowest adherence to an MD and a score of 14 indicates highest adherence [3]. Recent MD advice was taken into consideration [41] and types and quantities of foods within the PREDIMED score were adapted to reflect the typical diet and dietary recommendations in Northern Ireland [42].  4.3.",3e61c6c2-11c6-4e1f-9626-afdd34c36260
4,methods4," 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis of Blood  Plasma samples were collected from 58 participants (n = 137) at baseline (n = 58), 6 months (n = 44) and 12 months (n = 35). After blood collection, samples were left undisturbed at room temperature for 15 minutes for the blood to clot. Samples were centrifuged (2000× g; 10 min) and the supernatant (plasma) collected, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Plasma filtering was carried out using an adapted version of a previously used method [43]. Prior to filtration, centrifugal filter units (Amicon Ultracel; 0.5 mL; 3 kDa cut-off) were rinsed seven times each with H2O (0.5 mL) and centrifuged at 12,000× g for 20 min, to remove residual glycerol bound to the filter membranes. Each plasma sample (300 μL) was transferred to the centrifuge filter units. The samples were then centrifuged (13,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C) to remove macromolecules, which consist primarily of proteins and lipoproteins.",62afece2-865d-470a-a244-63da55e2ad07
5,methods5," Filtered plasma (285 µL) from each sample was transferred to a separate microcentrifuge tube. To each sample, D2O (35 μL) and buffer solution (30 μL; 11.7 mM DSS [disodium-2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulphonate], 1.75 M K2HPO4 (anhydrous), and 5.84 mM 2-chloro pyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid in H2O) was added. Samples (200 μL) were subsequently transferred to a standard Bruker 3mm Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) tube for analysis. Data collection was carried out on a 600 MHz Bruker ASCEND Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with a five mm TCI cryoprobe using randomised order with two hundred and fifty-six transients acquired. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm) of the operating frequency. DSS was used as the internal standard for chemical shift referencing and quantification.",0d87ef29-d180-4190-a82c-7a39a1a1616f
6,methods6," Using Bayesil (a web-based system that consists on a library of pure compounds specifically designed for the identification and quantification of 1D 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolites) [44,45] all collected spectra were profiled using a custom library of 59 metabolites.   4.4. Statistical Analysis To explore the metabolite associations, the 14-point Mediterranean diet score (MDS) (Supplementary Materials Table S7) was used to divide the samples into two groups. The highest Mediterranean diet score (MDS) achieved by any individual on the 14-point scale was 10; hence, the resulting groups were: Low Score: (0–4) and High Score (5–10) by splitting at the median (Supplementary Materials Table S3). Results obtained from these two groups were statistically analysed by performing univariate analysis (t-test with the software MetaboAnalyst (version 4.0) [46] to obtain the most significant features from identified metabolites.",1c226d01-9e6a-4cbe-83c2-4546967c3995
7,methods7," All data were normalised and auto-scaled (normalisation by sum and auto-scaling on Metaboanalyst) prior to univariate and multivariate analysis. False discovery rates (false discovery rate (FDR), q-value) were calculated to account for multiple comparisons applying the Bonferroni correction on Metaboanalyst. p-value, false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-values (q-values) and fold-change were calculated. Principal Component Analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)), Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA)) and Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) were carried out with both MetaboAnalyst (v4.0) and Simca (v14.0; Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) to observe group discrimination. principal component analysis (PCA) was also used to identify potential outliers, followed by PLS-DA to highlight significant metabolites which explained the maximum amount of variation between groups.",38c9ae4d-fd90-440b-8696-fbdb2916c871
8,methods8, An important issue with PLS-DA is deciding on the number of latent variables to be used to build the model. The default option offered by Metaboanalyst was used where the optimal number of latent variables was determined by Q2 (cross validated R2). Variable importance in projection (Variable importance in projection (VIP)) plots was used to identify the most influential metabolites responsible for the observed separation between groups. receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis is widely used to describe the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity with regard to biomarker performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUreceiver operating characteristic (ROC))) value is a robust measure used for biomarker discovery. MetaboAnalyst was used to develop receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of individual metabolites (Table 1).,f1c72a26-cd4e-430e-89db-97d2685734f5
9,methods9," In order to enhance this performance, pair-wise ratios of all possible metabolite concentrations were computed by Metaboanalyst showing those top-ranked ratios (Table 2). This procedure was applied for biomarker discovery rather than performance evaluation, due to the potential of over fitting. Data were tested for normality of distribution using the Shapiro Wilk test (IBM SPSS Statistics 25). All variables tested for correlations were nonparametric and therefore Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was obtained. Correlations were deemed significant where p was ≤ 0.05. Multiple comparison correction was applied to p-values of the metabolite-food groups correlation using the Benjamini-Hochberg approach on SPSS. The effects of smoking on blood metabolites were assessed by conducting a t-test between smoker/non-smoker groups using Metaboanalyst.  5.",bf59dcd2-45c8-41b4-b066-12e24e79438c
10,methods10," Conclusions In conclusion, this study reports for the first time that there is a potential association between blood levels of pyruvic acid, mannose and myo-inositol with MD consumption, and it corroborates previous associations with citric acid and betaine. It is only the third study to examine the relationship between blood metabolites levels and MD and it demonstrates the power of 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolomics in dietary intervention studies. Further studies should explore the validity of these biomarkers/biomarker ratios. Given the heterogeneous nature of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS), the metabolites highlighted here are reasonably discriminative, and there is potential to incorporate these into currently available blood-based biomarkers panels of dietary intake.
