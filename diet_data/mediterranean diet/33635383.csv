0,methods0," This was a cross-sectional observational study of 80 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), with indication for tumor resection surgery and/or chemoradiotherapy. The patients had been referred to the General and Digestive Surgery Service of University Hospital Dr. Peset in Valencia, Spain, and were sequentially enrolled into the study. The study was designed in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (Finland, 1964) and approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of University Hospital Dr. Peset. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in the study.  Analytical determinations were carried out in the hospital’s Clinical Analysis Laboratory and in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the Faculty of Medicine and Odontology of the University of Valencia.",102003b8-9f0f-4d26-9519-c3d429d24b66
1,methods1,"  Patients completed the validated MEditerranean Dietary Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) questionnaire to measure their adherence to the MD [18]. The test is a brief dietary assessment instrument consisting of a set of 14 short questions about daily or weekly consumption of different food groups (see Supplementary Table S1). Briefly summarized, the questions refer to the following (question number): olive oil (1 and 2); vegetables (3); fruit (4); red meat, sausages, and other processed meat (5); butter, margarine, or cream (6); carbonated and/or sugary drinks (7); wine (8); legumes (9); fish or seafood (10); industrially produced pastries (not homemade) (11); nuts (12); chicken, turkey, or rabbit vs. beef or pork (13); sofrito, a sauce that includes tomato, onion, garlic, and olive oil (14). Adherence was considered high when the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score was equal to or greater than 9 [19].",a4d5e0e3-8c30-46c9-a81e-1354c910959f
2,methods2,"  Anthropometric variables, blood pressure, data related to colorectal tumor (TNM stage, tumor size, location, association of adenomatous polyps, diverticulosis, etc.), clinical data, and the presence of comorbidities of interest (obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia) were recorded.  The following OS markers were evaluated: catalase (catalase (CAT)), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione system in serum; 8-oxodG and F2-isoprotans in urine. The first urine specimen of the day was collected, and so urinary creatinine excretion was also determined by spectrophotometry as a correction factor for the concentration or dilution of the sample.  Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) assays were used for catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), the glutathione system (by spectrophotometry), and F2-Isoprostanes (by ELISA).",e8434c3c-c3d4-469a-b71a-aa3305727154
3,methods3," The manufacturer’s methodological protocol was followed, with the subsequent reading of absorbance by a Thermo Labsystems Multiskan EX spectrophotometry/ELISAS reader (Beverly, MA, USA).  The molecule 8-oxodG was determined by high-resolution chromatography with an ESA Coulochem II electrochemical HPLC detector (Hucoa-Erlöss, Madrid, Spain). All sample dilutions, reagent preparations, and material washings were performed with HPLC-grade-purity water (ultrapure or type I).  In addition to OS markers, serum biochemical (glucose, cholesterol, and fractions, triglycerides, uric acid, and albumin) and tumor (CEA and CA 19.9) markers were measured. Biochemical determinations were performed by spectrophotometry in the automated chain of an Architect C16000 equipment from Abbott (Chicago, IL, USA) and the tumor markers were determined by electrochemiluminescence using a Cobas 6000 from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany).",1a0d735c-67cc-4e9d-b796-3fb973c7cae8

For the study of the different correlations between the variables, a bivariate correlation with P of Pearson was applied to parametric-distribution variables, and Spearman’s Rho was applied to non-parametric variables. The statistical significance level used in all cases was p < 0.05.  3. Results  The demographic characteristics and anthropometric and biochemical variables of the colorectal cancer (CRC) patients recruited for this study are shown in Table 1, distributed according to their adherence to the MD.

6,methods6," No significant differences were found in any of the anthropometric and biochemical parameters in relation to adherence to the MD, with the exception of HDL–cholesterol, which was higher in patients with high adherence (p = 0.048).  The mean Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire score of the 80 recruited colorectal cancer (CRC) patients was 8.6, out of a maximum total of 14 points. We found that 51.25% of the patients (n = 41) showed high adherence to the MD, with a mean score of 10.5 compared to a score of 6.7 for patients with low adherence. The items most commonly receiving a positive answer by the patients were numbers 1, 6, 7, and 13, concerning the consumption of olive oil for cooking and dressing, dairy product consumption, low consumption of sugary drinks, and consumption of white meat rather than red meat (85%), followed by item 2, related to the use of olive oil as the main oil used (81.3%), item 5, on the intake of red meat (73.",092d5f45-4377-48c7-85d7-be18afbf37e7

Regarding the presence of comorbidities, no significant differences were found between the participants with high adherence to the MD and those with low adherence to the MD for the prevalence of obesity (60.7% vs. 35.7%), hypertension (48.7% vs. 51.3%), dyslipidemia (48.8% vs. 51.2%), or diabetes (45.2% vs. 54.8%).  In reference to the tumor markers used in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), patients with a high adherence to the MD showed lower levels of CEA and CA 19.9 than those with low adherence, although the differences were not significant (Table 1).",d87cadbc-7b57-4d37-bcd9-7bbc38c2d271
8,methods8,"  In relation to the tumor stage, tumors at stages 0, 1, and 2 were found in 61%, 34.1%, and 4.9%, respectively, of high-adherence subjects, compared to 47.4%, 36.8%, and 15.8% of patients with low adherence, although no significant differences were observed between the groups (Table 2). An association was found between adherence to the MD and the WHO histological grade of the tumor. Among patients with low-grade tumors, 56.5% of them showed a high adherence to the MD, while 43.5% reported a low adherence to the MD, and only 20% of patients with a high histological grade tumor showed high adherence to the MD whereas 80% reported low adherence (p = 0.031). A similar pattern was observed for patients also presenting adenomas, which were less frequently observed in high-adherence patients (38.9%) than in patients who reported low adherence to the MD (61.1%).",ab79e531-d835-4608-a983-432c2f71a6a4
9,methods9,"  Regarding the markers of OS and oxidative damage in serum or urine, we observed that patients with high adherence to the MD had higher levels of the serum antioxidant glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (p = 0.029) and lower levels of urine 8-oxodG (p = 0.005), as shown in Figure 1. In addition, in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with high adherence to the MD, there was a trend towards higher levels of reduced glutathione (Glutathione (GSH), p = 0.074), lower levels of oxidized glutathione (Glutathione (GSH) in serum (d) Levels of Oxidized Glutathione (GSSG), p = 0.097), and lower Glutathione (GSH) in serum (d) Levels of Oxidized Glutathione (GSSG)/Glutathione (GSH) ratio (p = 0.098) with respect to those with low adherence to the MD. However, no significant differences were observed for catalase (CAT) (p = 0.538) and F2-isoprostanes (p = 0.290) between the two groups.",be46048c-9994-42eb-bc7d-1d61725831a0
10,methods10,"  When we analyzed the correlations between Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score and levels of tumor and OS markers (Table 3), a positive correlation with glutathione peroxidase (GPX) was detected (p = 0.045). In addition, CEA concentrations negatively correlated with the levels of catalase (CAT) (p < 0.001), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (p < 0.001), and Glutathione (GSH) (p = 0.005) and positively correlated with the levels of Glutathione (GSH) in serum (d) Levels of Oxidized Glutathione (GSSG) (p < 0.001), the Glutathione (GSH) in serum (d) Levels of Oxidized Glutathione (GSSG)/Glutathione (GSH) ratio (p < 0.001), and the levels of 8-oxodG (p = 0.009) and F2-isoprostanes (p = 0.015). On the other hand, CA 19.9 levels negatively correlated with catalase (CAT) (p < 0.001), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (p = 0.005), and Glutathione (GSH) (p = 0.022) and positively correlated with Glutathione (GSH) in serum (d) Levels of Oxidized Glutathione (GSSG) levels (p < 0.",c6fa0fd7-e739-4b9b-aa8a-d965bb6b8b0d

Discussion  The present study provides evidence that adherence to the MD is associated with an increase in HDL–cholesterol and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) levels and a decrease in 8-oxoDG levels. In relation to the adherence to the MD, we detected significant correlations between tumor and OS markers. Adherence to the MD also provided protection in terms of histological grade and stage of the tumor.  With regard to the 14 items that make up the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire, over 85% of patients complied with 5 of them, while the percentage was below 85% for 9 items. Of note was the high compliance with the use of olive oil for cooking and dressing food, the dairy product consumption, the low consumption of sugary drinks, and the consumption of white rather than red meat.",0f8dbd6a-837a-40fd-b6d0-b42a36b08f6b
12,methods12," When we compared our results with those of studies in which the same screening method was used, the mean score of our cohort was similar to the baseline score of the PREDIMED study [21] and higher than that of general-population surveys [22]. A total of 51.3% of our patients showed high adherence to the MD (score ≥ 9), which was also similar to the baseline percentage of the PREDIMED study.  The PREDIMED Spanish trial reported that an intervention with a vegetable-based MD rich in unsaturated fat and polyphenols had preventive effects against cardiovascular disease [21,23]. It is widely recognized that MD has beneficial effects on cardiometabolic health, including blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and lipid profile, thus decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease [10,24,25]. Regarding the biochemical parameters, we observed significant differences in lipid profile, especially in HDL–cholesterol levels, which were higher among participants with high adherence to the MD.",c10a4414-3ea1-43f9-9b59-3e2d344196b6
13,methods13," Several studies evaluated the association between adherence to the MD and HDL–cholesterol levels [10,26,27,28], a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Dietary polyphenol intake has been shown to increase serum HDL–cholesterol levels and may represent a potential treatment to raise HDL–cholesterol in dyslipidemic subjects [26]. The PREDIMED study also showed a reversion of metabolic syndrome due to beneficial effects on HDL–cholesterol, and also on other cardiovascular risk factors related to the syndrome [27]. Moreover, MD has been demonstrated to improve HDL–cholesterol function in high-cardiovascular-risk individuals [28].  The consumption of red meat (beef, pork, lamb, veal, mutton) is high in developed countries and is considered probably carcinogenic for humans [29]. Different mutagenic and/or carcinogenic compounds may explain the relationship between red meat consumption and colorectal cancer (CRC).",c2a3eb14-4d3f-4bbf-9c9f-80d0c1555f9d
14,methods14," These include heme iron in red meat, N-nitroso compounds, heterocyclic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polyunsaturated fatty acids, bile acids, non-human sialic acid, and infectious agents [30,31]. In fact, accumulated evidence of prospective epidemiological studies shows that the consumption of red meat and processed meat is a risk factor for developing polyps and colorectal cancer (CRC) [32] and increases the colorectal cancer (CRC) risk by 20–30% [33]. The results of a large number of investigations have corroborated the health benefits of significantly reducing the consumption of red meat [34,35,36]. Hence, the MD plays a protective role by containing a low amount of red and processed meat.",e0494865-5b15-4dc4-8b83-a8b11e86bc4c
15,methods15,"  Several reviews and meta-analyses in observational studies conducted in different cohorts with different types of cancer have highlighted an inverse association between a high adherence to the MD and the initiation and progression of cancer [13], especially in the case of colorectal cancer (CRC) [30,37,38]. For example, olive oil supplementation has been shown to be inversely associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk [39]. We observed a lower presence of synchronous adenomas in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with high adherence to the MD. In accordance with our results, Zheng et al. reported that the MD was inversely associated with the risk of early-onset adenoma [40]. An inverse association between adherence to the MD and the WHO histological grade of the tumor was also found. To the best of our knowledge, no other study has been conducted to analyze this potential association.",59ae12ba-fde6-43be-a957-be6da9a4cfab
16,methods16,"  On the other hand, we found no association with tumor stage, although 61% of our participants with high adherence to the MD were in stage 0, and only 4.9% were in stage 2. In the same way, in a prospective cohort study of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), a non-significant inverse association between adherence to the MD and risk of death was reported [41].  colorectal cancer (CRC) is related to disturbances of antioxidant defenses and increased oxidative and nitrosative damage to proteins and DNA [6,42]. It is generally considered that, at higher levels of OS, the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and Glutathione (GSH) decrease, and those of Glutathione (GSH) in serum (d) Levels of Oxidized Glutathione (GSSG), the Glutathione (GSH) in serum (d) Levels of Oxidized Glutathione (GSSG)/Glutathione (GSH) ratio, and 8-oxodG and F2-isoprostanes levels increase.",9a0ce4a0-b3c1-4dda-afe9-47053da50729
17,methods17," In addition, a key role of cellular pathways that provide protection against OS is played by vitagenes, including heat shock proteins as well as the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system [43]. In this context, dietary antioxidants have been shown to be neuroprotective through the activation of hormetic pathways. It has been shown that under systemic OS conditions, the induction of Hsp70 vitagenes is a maintained response to offset the intracellular pro-oxidant status triggered by the reduction of Glutathione (GSH) content and thioredoxin expression [44]. Different studies have shown that the MD significantly reduces the levels of a wide range of biomarkers of different aspects of OS, including those indicating oxidative DNA damage [45,46,47,48,49], lipid peroxidation, reactive metabolic products and by-products [47,50], and endogenous immune-inflammatory activation as a source of OS [46,51].",f65e4ba2-8482-40e8-bc52-d1502ab417ad
18,methods18," In contrast, higher levels of biomarkers of antioxidant defense and ROS detoxification have been reported [52]. MD adherence has been associated with increased levels of the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and inversely correlated with the levels of F2-isoprostanes [53]. In accordance with previous studies [3,42], our results show that the antioxidant levels negatively correlate with tumor-related markers and that the levels of oxidative products positively correlate with different tumor-related markers.  Regarding the influence of the MD on OS, Dai et al. [17] reported that a one-unit increment in the MD score described by Trichopoulou et al. [22] was associated with a 7% higher Glutathione (GSH)/Glutathione (GSH) in serum (d) Levels of Oxidized Glutathione (GSSG) ratio and lower OS. In our study, the serum levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) positively correlated with the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score.",939d1055-04ce-44d5-8e20-88093d76d731
19,methods19," These results can be considered important, since low levels of this enzyme have been related to an increase in cardiovascular risk [53,54]. Traditional Mediterranean dietary patterns, as well as other healthy diets, may reduce the plasma levels of inflammatory factors and OS markers [55]. We observed a trend towards more pronounced levels of markers of OS in patients with low adherence to the MD, although the differences were significant only for 8-oxodG and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Luisi et al. [46] studied the effect of an MD rich in extra virgin olive oil in individuals with obesity and found a decline in OS markers (8-oxodG) in both obese and control subjects. Poor adherence to the MD has also been associated with impaired OS in other metabolic conditions, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [56]. In addition, published studies reported a reduction in the levels of 8-oxodG and a modulation of DNA repair gene expression [9].",cdbd245b-b3d4-43fb-be93-a006f73b45dc
20,methods20," In particular, three studies reported a decrease in 8-oxo-dG levels in urine [57], plasma [58], stools [59], or peripheral blood leukocytes [60] after an MD intervention alone or in combination with other food/dietary components, while only one study failed to report significant effects [61]. Conversely, one study reported a significant reduction in the levels of oxidatively induced, but not endogenous, DNA damage [62]. These discrepancies between the different OS markers may be due to the fact that not all these markers are equivalent and that they do not equally respond to specific dietary interventions and clinical conditions.  5. Conclusions  Compared to those with low adherence to the MD, patients with high adherence displayed lower levels of 8-oxodG and increased concentrations of HDL–cholesterol and glutathione peroxidase (GPX).",3c345c8d-e94e-401a-888a-e2315a119f2e
21,methods21," Adherence to the MD was associated with the presence of a low WHO tumor histological grade and a lower presence of synchronic adenomas, all of which are factors of good prognosis.  The results of our study suggest that adherence to the MD has a protective role in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, although it is necessary to confirm these findings in a larger sample of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in a prospective study.
