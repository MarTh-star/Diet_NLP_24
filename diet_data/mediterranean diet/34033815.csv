0,background0," Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex disease in which multiple factors contribute to disability accrual. Mediterranean Diet (MeDi) has shown beneficial effects across neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that specific food habits, rather than global adherence to MeDi, might impact on MS. We aimed to (i) evaluate differences in adherence to MeDi between people living with MS (PwMS) and healthy controls (HC); (ii) characterize eating patterns in PwMS and HC, identifying the most influential MeDi items for each group by the use of network analysis; (iii) explore the relationship between patients' eating habits and disability.

1,methods0," Participants  Participants older than 18 at the time of screening were prospectively enrolled at the MS Center of the Sant'Andrea Hospital in Rome between March 2018 and August 2019. Participants with a diagnosis of MS according to most recent revised McDonald criteria 2017 (18) regardless of disease phenotype were recruited together with their family members and hospital staff to act as control group. The ethical committee board of Sapienza University of Rome at Sant'Andrea Hospital provided approval for the project. Informed, written consent has been obtained in all participants.  Exclusion criteria for both groups were: (1) diagnosis of metabolic diseases; (2) mental or psychiatric diseases; (3) pregnancy or breastfeeding; (4) food allergies and food intolerances; (5) ongoing vegetarian or vegan diet; (6) any condition preventing participants to provide adequate answers to the administered questionnaires; (7) ability to walk without support/aid.",fe8c41cd-0904-4fb6-9dea-82538ced7a19
2,methods1," For latter exclusion criteria, PwMS with and Expanded Disability Status Scale (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)) (19) higher than 5.5 were not recruited.  Study Procedures  The following information were collected in PwMS and HC: demographic data, pharmacological therapies, smoking (number of cigarettes smoked per day and duration of habit, i.e., smoking pack/year), telephone and email contacts.  We also evaluated the following anthropometric indicators: weight and height to calculate Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI) kg/m2), waist (WC) and hip circumferences, waist-hip ratio (waist hip ratio (WHR)).  For Body Mass Index (BMI), we used World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) cut-points to asses underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2), and obese (>30 kg/m2). For men WC≥94 cm and for women WC≥80 cm are cut-points used to assess cardiovascular risk in the general population (20).",f79544a1-61cf-4436-bf27-686786f1fbe4
3,methods2," Fat distribution is further defined as waist hip ratio (WHR) above 0.90 for males and above 0.85 for females (21).  Subsequently, the following questionnaires were administered:  MeDi adequacy questionnaire (22). This is a nine-question test, one for each food group (fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, meat and cold cuts, milk and derivatives, olive oil, alcohol). For each question there are three different answers, regarding the frequency intake of those particular foods, daily or weekly, with a score from 0 to 2, begin 0 = no intake and 2 = more than once a week, referring to the last month. Adding all the results, we evaluated the adequacy to MeDi (0–4 not adequate; 5–9 poorly adequate; 10–15 sufficiently adequate; 16–18 completely adequate). Moreover, we computed the frequency of intake for each food item and grouped food categories as “positive” (fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, olive oil) vs.",b34a735b-6ce0-4267-a6d8-bb9cc4ec5df5

The reduced form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) assessing the engagement in physical activity (23). The questionnaire is divided into 4 sections in which intense activities, moderate activities, walking and sitting are distinguished. For each of these categories the participant needs to specify how many days per week the various activities had been carried out and the total minutes of activity in one of those 7 days referring to the previous week.",1b60c6a5-5f4c-4c85-a4e3-be56da249f07
5,methods4," According to the scores obtained in the test, the person falls into three different groups that specify the levels of physical activity: inactive (lower score 700 Met); sufficiently active (score between 700 and 2,519 Met) and active or very active (score higher than 2,520 Met).  For each PwMS, the respective level of disability as measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (and fatigue in terms of Fatigue Severity Scale (Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)) (24) were evaluated the same day of questionnaire completion.  PwMS were dichotomized into two subgroups according to their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score: no disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) ≤1.5; i.e., no or minimal signs in more than one functional system) and disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) ≥2).",37e3c3e6-16ee-47d7-a5e3-a3450d7d3a66
6,methods5,"  Network Analysis  To identify what demographic or MeDi items were most influential for the eating habits of PwMS and how they were linked to disability and fatigue, we performed a network analysis. We created a structure depicting the connections, namely edges, among all the variables of interest, namely nodes, such as age, sex, and MeDi items (fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, meat, dairy, olive oil, alcohol). Thanks to this representation, we were able to identify the hubs, that are the most connected variables, thus the variables with the highest amount of connections with the other variables. First, to generate the edges connecting the nodes of the network, we built a mutual information matrix, representing the relation among age, sex, and MeDi items for both patients and HC (17).",68f456d3-f5db-4198-b02f-af5328d55bb3
7,methods6," The mutual information matrix was selected to describe the relation among age, sex and MeDi items, as it provided information on the mutual dependence between couples of variables, without any a priori assumption of linear association among them. Since the investigated variables were all categorical except for age, the continuous variable age was grouped by ranges of years and devised in 5 classes (from class 0 if age <20 years to class 4 if age>49 years and the other classes covering 10 years each) to build the mutual information matrix.  Then, we investigated the difference of age, sex and MeDi items association between PwMS and HC We obtained 1,000 random matrices by reshuffling, 1,000 times, values taken from the information matrices of PwMS and HC, and placing them into two matrices, that had the same dimensionality of the mutual information matrices but casual entries, and that were subtracted one from the other.",2b2d612c-3dbe-47b7-9919-13b0063624d7
8,methods7," Then, we averaged these 1,000 random matrices and compared the result with the difference between the mutual information matrix of HC and that of PwMS, by means of a Z-score. Z-scores were considered significant at alpha = 0.05 if Z>|1.96|.  Moreover, on the mutual information matrices of both PwMS and HCs, we calculated the hubs. Analytically, in a network, hubs are the variables with the degree larger than the average plus a standard deviation. The degree of an item is the number of its neighbors, e.g., of the number of links incident upon it. Network analysis was implemented in the open-source R environment (https://www.r-project.org/. For a flowchart of the network analysis see Figure 1.  Figure 1 Flowchart of the network analysis. Age, sex, and Mediterranean Diet items, such as fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, meat, diary, olive oil, and alcohol, were collected for both people living with MS and healthy controls.",815a2c3f-9827-4e3c-be4d-3ca83af13b7c
9,methods8," From the two datasets the mutual information matrices were calculated and hubs were identified via graph theory.  Statistical Analysis  All values are presented as mean (standard deviation) or median [range], as appropriate. Normal distribution assumption was checked for continuous variables by using Shapiro-Wilk tests.  Unpaired two-sample t-test and X2 test were used to compare demographic, clinical, anthropometric indicators, adherence to MeDi, frequency of food intake and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scores between PwMS MS and HC, as well as between PwMS with different levels of disability, as appropriate.  To test the association between hub nodes from network analysis and disability, a multivariate logistic regression was conducted. Specifically, we included hubs (obtained by network analysis) as independent variable and scores of either disability or fatigue as dependent variable.",a923badb-355e-459c-a963-875630e7d93f
10,methods9," Classes of disability were devised as no disability (class 0, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) < = 1.5), or disability (class 1, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)>1.5). Similarly, classes of fatigue were devised as no fatigue (class 0, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) lower than the median value) or fatigue (class 1, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) higher than the median value). Initially, we performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the minimum regression coefficient (beta) relative to sample size, considering alpha = 0.05 and power = 0.90. In multiple regression, collinearity exists if one variable is linearly predicted from the other and it may affect the reliability of the calculation of regression coefficients. Therefore, we checked for collinearity via Spearman correlation and removed correlated variables (p < 0.05 not corrected for multiple comparisons to be conservative at the most).",19c5fac6-253c-42e2-8f44-f552cda31d69
11,methods10," However, for completeness, also association between dependent variables and removed hubs was calculated as bivariate logistic regression. Significance was reached if p < 0.05.  Finally, as the network analysis identified as hubs only items pertaining to the “positive foods,” and did not include lifestyle factors other than diet, we conducted a post-hoc analysis, investigating the relationship between “negative foods,” lifestyle factors (smoking, exercise) and clinical outcomes (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)) via hierarchical regression.  Analyses were conducted with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 25.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

21,results10," Significant positive Spearman correlations show monotonic association between variables, thus that the increase of one is paralleled by the increase of the other, thus eating habits of PwMS include a large intake of all the “positive foods” identified as hubs.

22,results11,"  Because of the collinearity, we did not perform a multiple regression including all the hubs in the same model, but rather a bivariate logistic regression for each hub to predict either Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) or Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) groups.

24,discussion0," In our work we did not find significant differences in terms of adequacy to MeDi between PwMS and HC, nor significant differences regarding food intake within the study population besides fish and alcohol consumption. Even though most participants fell into the normal weight category value according to Body Mass Index (BMI) and were adherent to MeDi, PwMS showed higher values of waits and hip circumferences compared to HC. The network analysis allowed us to unveil the relation between specific food items (fruit, vegetables, cereal and fish). In particular, PwMS showed an eating behavior characterized by the consumption of “positive” foods, whose intake appears highly intercorrelated and might partially contribute to physical disability level.  Adherence to MeDi, Intake of Specific Food, Lifestyle Habits  We found no significant differences in MeDi adequacy between PwMS and HC, in line with previous findings (25).",7122e08d-dbe0-4354-ac0a-4a378a7f45a9
25,discussion1," However, although most of the participants in both groups were sufficiently adherent to MeDi, a very low percentage of participants were completely adherent to it (2% PwMS and 1% HC). Even though MeDi is the most used food model in Mediterranean countries, such as Italy, even the general population is not completely adherent to it, with younger age groups and smokers being less adherent (26). Accordingly, in our work participants less adherent to MeDi showed higher values of smoking pack/years and particularly, in the group of PwMS there was a higher percentage of participants with long-term smoking habits compared to HC. Generally, the category of smokers seems to have a less healthy lifestyle and incorrect eating habits than non-smokers (27).  When we explored differences in terms of food intake frequency, we observed a tendency toward a healthier diet in the group of PwMS, as they consumed more frequently fish and less frequently alcohol than HC.",c0770f97-11b4-418c-b7a6-8226270adbc6
26,discussion2," Despite the healthier diet, in our sample of PwMS higher values of waist and hip circumferences compared to HC were detected. WC is used to measure abdominal adiposity and high values are common among PwMS (28). While in our study population the Body Mass Index (BMI) was in the range of accepted values and most of the PwMS fell in the normal weight category, there is evidence showing that an increase in circumferences values is associated with greater disability even in normal weight subjects (28). This is confirmed in our sample, where patients with higher level of disability showed significantly higher WC and waist hip ratio (WHR) values in comparison with the no disability group. An excess of visceral or abdominal adiposity is one of the characteristics of the metabolic syndrome often related to other disorders such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension (28).",06ad6a22-f60a-4e4a-a06a-f654d820dd80
27,discussion3," Metabolic and vascular comorbidities affect both neuroperformance and brain and gray matter volumes in MS, contributing to neurodegeneration and long-term disability (29).  Even though in our work we did not collect serological nutrional biomarker and such interpretations remain speculative, several evidences support the correlation between an excess of adipose tissue and the severity of MS. Firstly, an overweight or obese subject has a state of chronic inflammation characterized by an altered production of cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-α, leptin, and a downregulation of anti-inflammatory molecules (30). Additionally, overweight negatively impacts disease course by modulating monocyte cell number through ceramide-induced DNA methylation of anti-proliferative genes (31). This increased state of inflammation of overweight/obese subjects is also observed within the Central Nervous System (Central Nervous System (CNS)).",edc5dfba-209b-4217-8455-dd9ae151e6c3
28,discussion4," In particular, a recent study has shown elevated levels of proinflammatory molecules (IL-6 and leptin) and reduced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-13 in the cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) of obese MS patients, and patients with higher Body Mass Index (BMI) (Body Mass Index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2) also had significantly higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) values (30).  Excess of adipose tissue in PwMS might also affect daily clinical practice, as it can interfere with the response to drugs, possibly due to altered drug pharmacokinetics (32). Indeed, a study carried out on a population of adult patients, under interferon-beta (IFNβ) therapy, showed that overweight and obese patients have increased disease activity, as assessed by NEDA status (composite score of no evidence of disease activity). This result indicates that overweight and obesity may have an impact on IFNβ-treatment response (33).",c40dfe18-eb37-4533-9ccd-a976b248d798
29,discussion5," Based on these data, regular exercise by reducing visceral adiposity may play a key role in reducing inflammation. Finally, in line with previous evidence (34), PwMS were less physically active and showed overall lower International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scores compared to HC.  Food Network Analysis  The food network analysis identified fruits, vegetables, cereals and fish as hubs in PwMS with meat and alcohol being hubs in HC, suggesting, in line with our analysis of food intake frequency, that PwMS tend to have a healthier diet than HC. It is possible that PwMS, having a chronic disease, are urged to pay more attention to what they eat than the general population. Indeed, a previous study has shown that patients, following an initial clinical diagnosis of Central Nervous System (CNS) demyelination, tend to change their diet, increasing the amount of fruit and/or vegetables and following a low-fat diet (35).",74075f36-5d8d-455d-b66f-337e2db0e413
30,discussion6," Additionally, a recent work has shown a trend toward reduced levels of storage lipids (fatty acids, cholesterol esters, triglycerides, and diglycerides) in the plasma of PwMS in comparison with HC (36). Additionally, in line with previous findings highlighting the potential effects of MeDi on MS course and disability (16) in our study participants higher consumption of vegetables and fish was inversely correlated to global motor disability, as assessed via Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). This relationship hints to a beneficial role of food hubs on disability outcomes but might also disclose an inverse causality.  Foods identified as hub of PwMS (fruits, vegetables, cereals and fish) are rich in fiber, vitamins, ω-3 polyunsaturated fats or antioxidant molecules and possibly exert a protective effect on the disease (14, 37).",9793fd64-a7e7-4fed-9c43-6c3f065cf469
31,discussion7," In particular, antioxidant molecules such as vitamins C and E, plant polyphenol and carotenoids might contrast free radicals, with beneficial effects on the inflammatory response (37). Another mechanism by which hub foods that could influence the disease outcomes is the modulation of the microbiota (38). Specifically, foods with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) and fiber can positively modify microbiota through the proliferation of bacteria with anti-inflammatory action. Both short-chain fatty acids (short chain fatty acids (SCFA)) obtained from the bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)s, contained in fish, have an anti-inflammatory function (39, 40).",38ca0ee7-c218-4d39-8d4b-b070f6293341
32,discussion8," Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that disease-related symptoms such as mobility deficits and cognitive impairment in more disabled PwMS might have affected the access to healthier food, that usually require a more dedicated preparation rather than easy snacks or fast-foods, partly accounting for the observed relationship between food hubs intake and disability (41). However, in our sample of PwMS we have not recruited those with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) higher than 5.5, also in order to restrain this potential bias.  Relationship Between “Negative Foods” Lifestyle Factors and Disability  Our post-hoc analysis disclosed an independent predictive role for “negative foods,” exercise and smoking on motor disability. This finding suggests that not only the intake of “positive foods” is related to disability, but that the global composition of the dietary regimen as well as the lifestyle adopted potentially affect MS outcomes.",e8dd8d90-0fb3-4373-8f65-a8cb64ec5106
33,discussion9," Specifically, both smoking habit and low level of exercise were related to disability and fatigue independently from diet, as previously suggested (42, 43). Although reverse causality and simultaneity cannot be excluded when interpreting these associations, the relevance of a balanced dietary regimen, rich in “positive foods” and poor in “negative foods,” associated to a healthy lifestyle, might explain why studies exploring the beneficial effects of isolated dietary supplementations are often unsuccessful (44).  Our work is not without limitation. First, the cross-sectional design of our work limited the ability to explore the temporal relationship between lifestyle habits and changes in disability and fatigue over time, preventing us from drawing conclusions about direct causality. Second, we used a qualitative questionnaire to assess the adequacy to MeDi and food intake, intrinsically limiting the exact estimation of nutrients intake. We did not measure serum markers (i.e.",13b8a270-c037-4055-94f8-41c41c47716f

Moreover, the use of family members as part of the control group might have limited the possibility to reveal real differences in dietary and lifestyle habits with PwMS. We have tried to minimize this occurrence introducing another set of controls in the HC group (healthcare staff). Indeed, the choice of family members as control group lie on the basis that family peers share characteristics such as socioeconomic and educational level with their relatives, that are known to influence diet behaviors (45).  Conclusion  In conclusion, we identified a sufficient, although not optimal adherence to MeDi in our population. People living with MS showed a healthier dietary pattern than HC.",b4267ed4-4a0c-4459-bfb6-d6479413c951
35,discussion11," Among food hubs, vegetables and fish were related to disability outcomes, which, in turn, were also predicted by intake of foods rich in saturated fats and alcohol, smoking and exercise. Our results confirm the association between diet, lifestyle and disability, suggesting that the modulation of these factors might affect MS outcomes. Further, our results suggest that, rather than the intake of a single food, the association of a food with the others is at the basis of the difference between PwMS and HC dietary habits. Future longitudinal studies applying integrated approaches should be planned to confirm these hypotheses, as the adoption of specific dietary regimens and exercise plans, could be used as complementary to the prescription of standard pharmacological therapies.
