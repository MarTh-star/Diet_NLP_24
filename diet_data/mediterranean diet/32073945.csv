0,methods0," 2.1. Study Sample  The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study is a multicenter prospective study carried out on over 500,000 volunteers from ten European countries [18,19]. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain Dementia Cohort was established from a sample of 25,015 European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain participants from three European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain study centers which carried out the prospective ascertainment of dementia cases: Gipuzkoa, Navarra, and Murcia [20].  Participants were 30 to 70 years old at enrolment between 1992 and 1996, and were mostly blood donors, civil servants, and general population. Exclusion criteria were being pregnant or breastfeeding, or not being physically or mentally capable of participating.",b397c79c-45da-4e51-bded-578c72787550
1,methods1," Baseline data on diet, lifestyles, and medical and reproductive history were collected during in-person interviews. In addition, participants underwent a physical examination to obtain anthropometric information, and provided a blood sample. Further details on study design and sample characteristics can be found elsewhere [19,20].  2.2. Dietary Assessment  Detailed information on habitual food consumption during the previous year was collected through a validated diet history method, administered face-to-face by trained dietitians [21].  Questionnaires were structured by meals according to occasions of food intake and subjects were asked about foods consumed in a typical week, accounting for food preparation, frequency of consumption and usual portion size. All foods consumed at least twice a month were considered (except liver, included when consumed at least once a month) and seasonal and weekly variations (working days or weekends) were taken into account.",31138149-8fa8-4d39-b3c6-59f427c54ed0
2,methods2," Total daily energy and nutrient intakes were calculated using country-specific food composition tables, further harmonized within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Nutrient DataBase project [22].  Plausibility of dietary intake was defined according to the predicted total energy expenditure (pTEE) method [23], identifying implausible reporters based on the ratio of estimated energy intake to predicted total energy expenditure (rEI:pTEE).  2.3. Relative Mediterranean Diet (rMED) Score  Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was assessed by means of the relative Mediterranean Diet score (rMED), a variation of the original Mediterranean diet score by Trichopoulou et al. [24] defined within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain cohort.",4071aa61-7d86-4f82-95bd-e611a658ab9e
3,methods3,"  The rMED score is based on 9 components: 6 considered as positive (fruit, vegetables, olive oil, legumes, fish, and cereals), 2 considered as negative or detrimental (meat and dairy products), and alcohol. Intake for each component was standardized as grams per 1000 kcal and divided by tertiles. Positive components score 0, 1, and 2 for the first, second, and third groups defined by tertiles of intake, respectively, while detrimental components score 2, 1, and 0 for the first, second, and third groups, respectively. For alcohol intake, 2 points are given to consumption within a sex-specific range (5–25 g/day for women, 10–50 g/day for men), and 0 points otherwise [24,25]. Thus, the rMED score ranged from 0 (minimum) to 18 (maximum). Levels of adherence to the MD were classified as low (0–6 points), medium (7–10 points), and high rMED scores (11–18 points) as previously defined [25].",f8a51aca-c6ab-4698-b72d-2410d449a2ff
4,methods4,"  Since associations of MD with health-related outcomes may vary depending on the operative definition of the MD pattern [6], three alternative MD indexes, i.e., the Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) by Trichopoulou et al. [24], the adapted relative Mediterranean Diet score (arMED) by Buckland et al. [26], and the alternate Mediterranean Diet Index (aMED), by Fung et al. [27], were evaluated in a sensitivity analysis.  2.4. Ascertainment of Dementia Cases  A two-phase validation protocol was designed to ascertain incident dementia cases occurring in the cohort based on medical records, as detailed previously [28]. In brief, potential cases were identified by record linkage of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) database with primary care records, hospital discharge databases, and regional mortality registries.",da454502-3e5b-4089-a101-e4060a5b90c6
5,methods5," Incident dementia cases were then validated after a careful and extensive examination of all medical records available for each potential case by a panel of neurologists, who determined the sub-type whenever possible.  Participants were followed up from recruitment until the date of diagnosis, death, loss to follow-up, or the last complete vital status check (31 December 2017 for Gipuzkoa, 31 December 2015 for Navarra, and 30 November 2016 for Murcia), whichever occurred first.  Participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study did not undergo a baseline cognitive assessment. However, all volunteers were considered to have normal cognition since they were required to be able to complete extensive and demanding questionnaires, including a dietary history interview which took 50–60 min on average.",e390a4be-158f-4eb9-a13f-dc14f9386d85
6,methods6," The case ascertainment process identified only one prevalent case, whereas four participants developed dementia within the first 5 years of the study (only one in the first 3 years).  From the 25,015 participants without evidence of prevalent dementia at baseline, we excluded a total of 1651 patients with at least one major chronic pathology (diabetes, ischemic heart disease, stroke, or cancer). We further excluded as energy mis-reporters a total of 7204 participants with a reported energy intake beyond 30% of the estimated energy requirement (corresponding to a cutoff of ±2 SD of the rEI:pTEE ratio), including 206 incident dementia cases. Thus, the final sample consisted of 16,160 participants, among which 308 incident AD cases and 151 incident non-AD (non-Alzheimer’s disease) cases were identified after a total observation time of 349,242 person-years, corresponding to a mean follow-up time (±SD) of 21.6 (±3.4) years).  2.5.",850bcfc5-ff3a-4c24-b5e8-9c4a006ba49b
7,methods7," Assessment of Anthropometric, Clinical and Lifestyle Data  Additional questionnaire information was collected at baseline on educational level, smoking status, and medical and reproductive history during in-person interviews. Data on prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes was self-reported. Height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences were measured by trained personnel during a physical examination following standard procedures [29]. Quetelet’s body mass index was estimated as weight (in kg) divided by squared height (in m).  2.6. Ethics  The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study protocol was approved by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)) Ethics Committee. All participants voluntarily agreed to take part and gave written informed consent.",8301d74f-cf2b-428b-b772-9105cf158c85
8,methods8," The current research has been conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the paper was written according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)) statement (https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe) (accessed on 22 November 2020).  2.7. Statistics  Baseline characteristics of cases and non-cases were described using absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables and medians and inter-quartile ranges for continuous variables. Statistical differences by case status or rMED categories were assessed with χ2 (categorical variables), Mann-Whitney U (for comparisons between two groups) or Kruskal-Wallis (for comparisons across three categories) tests.",54922077-4378-4c72-ae7e-b349d230c4b0
9,methods9,"  Hazard ratios (HR) of dementia and dementia sub-types were estimated using proportional hazards Cox models, stratified by age (in 5-year categories) and study setting (to account for heterogeneity in methods and population characteristics across centers). Entry time was defined as age at recruitment, and exit time was age at diagnosis for dementia cases, and age at death or censoring for non-cases. Adherence levels were defined based on the rMED, by categorizing the score into low (0–6 points), medium (7–10 points) and high (11–18 points) adherence groups. HR were estimated for ‘medium’ and ‘high’ rMED categories as compared with ‘low’ rMED scores, and for every 2-point increment of the score as a continuous variable under the linearity assumption.",dd3604de-9932-45e7-b05a-d90d73457234
10,methods10," Besides, non-linear associations of dementia with the rMED score were evaluated after a restricted cubic spline transformation of the exposure (with internal knots at the 33rd and 67th centiles), by plotting the predicted HR against the rMED score. A basic model was fitted including sex, educational level, and energy intake as potential confounders, whereas final multivariable models were further adjusted by other variables which could partially account for confounding of the exposure–outcome association: smoking habit (never, former, current, unknown), BMI group (normal weight, overweight, obese), elevated waist circumference (≥102 cm in men, ≥88 cm in women), sum of household and recreational physical activity (in Metabolic equivalents [MET]∙h/week), self-reported hypertension (no, yes, unknown), self-reported hyperlipidemia (no, yes, unknown), combined coffee and tea consumption (in mL/day), and daily intake of potatoes, eggs, and cakes and biscuits, in (g/day).",86ab4ab6-7929-4e64-9570-f8462387c2cc
11,methods11," In women, final multivariable models also included menopausal status (pre-, peri-, post-menopausal), ever use of oral contraceptives (yes, no, unknown), and ever use of hormonal replacement therapy (yes, no, unknown). The proportional hazards assumption was checked in all models based on Schoenfeld residuals and visual inspection of log-log survival plots, and no significant deviations were found.  Main analyses were stratified by sex and dementia sub-types (AD and non-AD), whereas potential effect modification of the rMED and dementia association was evaluated for sex, educational level, smoking habit, and obesity. Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess heterogeneity.  Time-dependent effects were evaluated using flexible parametric Royston-Parmar (RP) multivariable models [30], by plotting the HR for high vs. low rMED scores over follow-up time.",27469b15-7bc8-4122-9bc0-074db1b6d3d1
12,methods12," RP models implement the use of separate sets of spline terms to model baseline hazard rates and time-dependent effects of a covariate, thus allowing for a smooth representation of the change in HR over time.  All analyses were performed with Stata/SE v.14.2 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). Two-sided (when appropriate) p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  3. Results  459 incident cases of dementia (67% AD) were available for analysis after a mean of 21.6 (±3.4) years (see Figure S1, flowchart of study participants). Baseline characteristics of the sample, including dementia and AD cases, are summarized in Table 1.  Dementia cases were more likely to be older, obese, to have low educational level, higher intake of fruits and dairy products and lower intake of meat. On the contrary, non-cases were more likely to be smokers, and to consume more energy, alcohol, coffee and tea.",b9c8b056-c91c-4e65-9563-576717891d8c
13,methods13," High adherence to the rMED score was positively associated to age, male sex, obesity and intake of total energy and nuts (Supplementary Table S1). High adherence was also more frequent among post-menopausal women. By contrast, low adherence to the rMED was associated with smoking, leisure time physical activity, and higher intake of eggs, coffee and tea.  Table 2 shows the results of the multivariable survival analyses between rMED adherence and incidence of dementia, overall and by sex. A greater adherence to the MD pattern was associated with a 20% lower risk of dementia (HR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.60–1.06), and an estimated 8% lower risk per 2-point increment in the continuous rMED score (p for linear trend on the continuous variable = 0.021). The negative trend was found to be statistically significant in women, but not men.",3e35800b-c360-4537-b1ad-cb2d0f0e4d7c
14,methods14," The shape of the association is graphically illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the restricted cubic spline modelling of dementia risk by sex according to the rMED score, suggesting a non-linear relationship with a steeper slope at lower rMED scores. Although point estimates were similar in both sexes, results in men did not reach statistical significance.  When further stratifying results by dementia sub-types, the negative association with MD was stronger among women for non-AD dementia, with up to 48% lower risk (95%CI: 0–73%) for those with high vs. low adherence to the MD, whereas rMED suggest a favorable while not statistically significant association with AD (HR high vs. low rMED = 0.57, 95%CI: 0.32–1.01) among men (Table 3). The decline in dementia risk was steeper for non-AD in the low-medium score range of the rMED, whereas the favorable association with AD risk suggested no evidence against a linear relationship (p for non-linearity = 0.353, Figure S5).",01d5e806-0417-4826-a16d-9033708cfdc8
15,methods15,"  Table 4 evaluates selected variables as potential effect modifiers of the rMED and dementia association. The results, while not statistically significant, suggest a possible heterogeneity for education (p for interaction = 0.055). Among those with primary education or lower, participants with medium and high adherence to the MD had about 20% lower risk of dementia, a pattern that was not consistent in participants with higher education. The rMED score was significantly associated with dementia in women and non-smokers, but there was no formal evidence of heterogeneity by sex, smoking or ponderal status.  Time-varying effects for the association of rMED with dementia were studied by means of RP flexible survival models, by plotting HR as a function of follow-up time (Figure 2).",87e4a224-336d-4e4e-95b2-88788ce65a43
16,methods16," Results show the change in HR estimates throughout study time, revealing that HR < 1 were detectable only after a long follow-up (~18 years), when the larger cumulative number of cases, which increased exponentially with the aging of the sample, allowed for more powerful estimations.  The distribution of baseline characteristics and dietary variables according to rMED categories are shown in Table 5, separately for cases and non-cases. The rMED score was effective in ranking participants according to their dietary intake for almost all the diet groups included in the index (except for nuts and seeds, eggs, and coffee). Besides, higher adherence to the rMED score was associated with older age, female sex, lower prevalence of smoking, higher prevalence of obesity and less leisure time physical activity among non-cases. For cases, differences were only observed for sex and leisure time physical activity.",d7e1b24f-b826-4c4d-8dfc-3491729729f1
17,methods17," Notably, there were no differences in educational level by rMED categories in any group.  Further supplementary analyses showed the robustness of the results to exclusion of components of the rMED score on an item-by-item basis (Figure S2), to different multivariable models with increasing levels of adjustment, to other sensitivity analyses to account for potential reverse causation (Figure S3), and to alternative operational definitions of the MD (arMED, Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), and aMED scores) (Figures S4 and S5). Stratification of the main analysis according to plausibility of energy reporting (Figure S6), which would eventually lead to misclassification of dietary exposure, resulted in wide confidence intervals and non-significant dementia risk estimates among mis-reporters (p for linear trend = 0.887).  4.",077931c8-7dc9-486a-bd34-df32941850ea
18,methods18," Discussion  In this large prospective study involving 16,160 Spanish middle-aged and elderly participants followed up for over 20 years, participants with ‘high’ adherence compared to those with ‘low’ adherence to the MD (categorical rMED score) had a 20% lower risk of dementia overall. A negative linear trend was significant among women, those with lower educational level, and non-smokers. By dementia sub-types, associations were stronger for non-AD dementia in women and for AD in men. Of note, the association between rMED score and dementia incidence was revealed only after mis-reporters of energy intake were excluded from the analyses.  Mis-reporting (over- or under-reporting) of energy intake is a potential source of error in nutritional epidemiological studies, affecting the reliability and validity of nutritional assessment and confounding or attenuating diet–disease associations [31].",ca440bec-89d5-4022-b99b-956eecc162ef
19,methods19," Different methods have been developed to minimize the impact of mis-reporting bias in epidemiological studies that rely on the ratio of reported intakes to predicted total energy expenditure, estimating a reference interval to account for individual variations in physical activity levels (physical activity levels (PAL)) [32,33]. Reporting of dietary energy can thus be regarded as plausible when the energy intake calculated from the dietary questionnaire falls within the defined cut-offs, or implausible (over- or under-reporting) otherwise. All European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain participants have been assessed for reporting plausibility following the methodology described by Mendez et al. [23], and classified accordingly. Our data suggested that dietary mis-reporting had a non-negligible impact in the accuracy of estimates of dementia risk, increasing estimation errors and reducing the power to detect significant associations.",149fbaf8-10eb-4633-b33d-18c45d77e6b9
20,methods20," Therefore, we have restricted the main analyses to plausible reporters.  There is suggestive evidence for a protective role of the MD with regards to dementia risk [2], and a considerable body of evidence suggests that MD may have a protective effect on cognition by decreasing the risk of cognitive impairment and delaying the onset of dementia [10,11,34]. In agreement with previous findings, our results suggest that adherence to MD could significantly decrease the risk of dementia [10,11]. Every 2-point increase of the rMED score was associated with an 8% and 6% lower risk of dementia and AD (although results for AD were not statistically significant), respectively, and results suggest a dose-response effect with decreasing risks of dementia at higher scores of the rMED score. However, a protective effect of the Mediterranean dietary pattern against cognitive decline or dementia has been reported in some [13,17,35,36,37,38] but not all [12,35] previous studies.",b7644219-35d1-4b9d-b723-0c3764981ca8
21,methods21," Several cohort studies showed that the MD or its components were positively associated with a better cognition and contributed to delay the onset of mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), both in Mediterranean [13,39,40] and non-Mediterranean countries [41,42]. Results from the PREDIMED (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) clinical trial also support the role of MD and olive oil consumption on cognitive performance and the decreased risk of age-related cognitive decline [38]. However, only a few prospective cohort studies have examined the association between MD and the incidence of dementia or AD [12,13,17,37], and the available evidence in support of a protective role of MD remains inconclusive. In the WHICAP (Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project) study, Scarmeas et al. [17] found that AD risk decreased by 9% for each additional point of the MeDi score (HR = 0.91; 95%CI: 0.83, 0.",ecdcc941-2d2f-4982-b0c6-64c85529fa94
22,methods22,"98), a MD scale ranging from 0 to 9 points, among 2258 US non-demented elderly followed up for a mean of 4 years. Furthermore, participants in the upper (vs. lower) scoring third had a 40% lower risk for AD (HR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.42, 0.87). A further study by Morris et al. [16] in 923 US elderly participants from the Memory and Aging Project (Memory and Aging Project (MAP)) project observed a 54% lower risk of AD when comparing participants in the high and low groups based on tertiles of the MIND (Mediterranean-Dietary Approach to Systolic Hypertension (Dietary Approach to Systolic Hypertension (DASH)) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet) score (HR = 0.46; 95%CI: 0.27, 0.79), a hybrid pattern that combined the MD and the Dietary Approach to Systolic Hypertension (DASH) diet. Our result of a negative trend in dementia risk for the continuous rMED score thus add to previous data in support of a beneficial role of MD against dementia.",635fc019-2be7-4407-a817-484934468807
23,methods23," However, a recent large US prospective study conducted by Hu et al. in 13,630 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)) Study found no significant associations for the aMED, Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI))-2010 or Dietary Approach to Systolic Hypertension (DASH) dietary scores with incident dementia after 27 years of follow-up [37]. This is in line with a previous French study by Feart et al. [12], who followed a cohort of 1410 French elderly over 5 years and could not find evidence that MD decreased dementia risk, despite a significant association with lower cognitive decline as defined by higher MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) scores. Of note, the authors acknowledged the limited power to detect significant effects given the scarce number of cases and short follow-up time.",ca1c45a4-48d3-4a4c-94da-9c0e46a1a30f
24,methods24," Nevertheless, in spite of the scarce prospective literature available on the association of MD with dementia or AD risk, our results add to previous evidence in support of a beneficial role for the MD against dementia [10,11,43,44].  The MD could be related to a lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia through several potential mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and lipid-lowering actions [45] and a favorable effect on cardiovascular risk factors [44,46]. The MD has been associated with lower levels of C-reactive protein and interleukins, previously found to increase the risk of major forms of dementia such as AD and vascular dementia [47,48]. The MD has also been shown to modulate glucose and lipid metabolism, improving insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profile, and to reduce the risk for hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease [8,9,45], risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia [4].",d9ebaffe-c55f-48e9-b9d3-b9d22ff8a795
25,methods25," Furthermore, several components of the MD, such as olive oil, fish, vegetables, or nuts are associated with reduced inflammation and dyslipidemia [46,49], and are rich in antioxidants, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, β-carotene, or flavonoids, and minerals such as selenium [45], that could ameliorate the age-related decline in cognitive function that precedes the onset of dementia. The pleiotropy of the advantageous effects of the MD supports the biological plausibility of its potential role in reduction of dementia risk.  We found no evidence that the association of rMED with dementia incidence varied by sex, smoking or obesity, which are potential effect modifiers as risk factors for dementia or cardio-metabolic risk that configure the patho-physiological environment (i.e., inflammation, oxidative stress, neurovascular dysfunction) through which diet would exert its effects on the prevention of dementia or dementia sub-types [44,45,46].",293a9b3b-3488-4e3b-a00d-735d6479d5e7
26,methods26," However, there was some indication of heterogeneity according to educational level (P interaction = 0.055), so that estimates were more robust among participants with lower education across categories of the rMED score. However, considering the similarity in HR estimates for the high vs. low rMED categories, as well as for the score as a continuous variable, the heterogeneity reported might be a consequence of the scarce number of events that occurred in the group with higher educational level, distorting the estimates in the medium score group. Our results were robust against a series of sensitivity analyses. The case-wise exclusion of single rMED components had little influence on overall estimates (Figure S2). We further excluded the first five years of follow-up and found no evidence of a potential reverse causation bias (Figure S3).",1403c1de-27f0-48e7-ab93-5bf9f120463a
27,methods27," We also considered alternative operational definitions of the MD, as the use of different scores might partly account for the heterogeneous results in the literature. We found a similar association in shape and magnitude for the rMED and arMED indices, which was slightly attenuated when using the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), whereas the aMED score showed a flat null association with dementia risk in our cohort. Of note, the aMED index was developed by Fung et al. as an attempt to adapt the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) to the US population [27].  Our study has some limitations. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort was established to study the determinants of cancer and it was not designed to study dementia as a primary outcome. For this reason, participants did not undergo a baseline cognitive assessment to exclude prevalent cases of dementia or mild cognitive impairment.",ffa14e89-4c5b-42fc-b223-3f3f99325dcb
28,methods28," However, only one case was validated as prevalent after the revision of clinical records of potential cases, and the exclusion of participants with less than five years of follow-up had no impact on the estimates. Furthermore, diagnoses were based on clinical records available from the public health system, rather than prospective evaluations of the participants’ cognitive function. Nevertheless, given the universal coverage of the country health system, we are confident that virtually all incident cases from our cohort diagnosed with dementia have been ascertained.",e4f63df7-6292-4c21-9822-39e3f48e6ccd
29,methods29," Other limitations are that diet and covariate data were only assessed at baseline and we could not evaluate potential exposure and lifestyle changes during follow-up, and that we had no data available on genetic traits such as apolipoprotein E (apolipoprotein E (APOE)) genotype (presence of ε4 alleles), although previous evidence suggest that apolipoprotein E (APOE) is not associated with MD and has no influence on the association between MD and AD [17]. As in any observational study, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual or unmeasured confounding. Finally, the lack of representativeness of the cohort could limit the generalizability of the results to other populations.  Major strengths of our study are the large sample size and long follow-up that were revealed as crucial for the ability to identify potential clinically relevant associations with sufficient precision.",9dbadc5a-cafd-4988-a4f6-de275517d7a9
30,methods30," Nevertheless, statistical power could still be limited in some sub-group analyses with lower number of cases, as reflected by wider confidence intervals. Of note, this is the second largest study available evaluating the association of MD with a hard dementia or AD endpoint, and the largest ever conducted in a Mediterranean country. Lack of sufficient number of cases or an insufficient follow-up time could have prevented other studies from reaching significant conclusions. The Mediterranean setting of the cohort, its geographical variability within the country, and the availability of an extensive set of socio-demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables to adjust for are important features. Finally, mis-reporting was shown to be an important factor to account for. Therefore, being able to control mis-reporters by identifying and excluding them from the analysis reinforced the accuracy of our estimates.  5.",b4a1dbfc-f99c-4805-bc52-d5b07856e808
31,methods31," Conclusions  In conclusion, adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a 20% lower risk of dementia overall in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain Dementia Cohort, a Mediterranean study involving over 16,000 middle-aged and elderly participants followed up for over 20 years. Associations were stronger for non-AD dementia in women and for AD in men, and among participants with lower education. The significant associations were revealed after excluding energy mis-reporters and required a long follow-up time. Further cohort studies with sufficient number of cases and follow-up will contribute to reinforce the evidence for the role of MD in risk reduction of cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease.
