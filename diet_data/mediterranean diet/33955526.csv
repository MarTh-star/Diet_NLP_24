0,methods0," Prospective analyses among 18,418 participants (mean age 36 years, 60.8% women) of the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN)) cohort. Dietary intake information was obtained through a validated semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)). The Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) (expressing high-quality macronutrient intake) was calculated based on three previously reported quality indices: the Carbohydrate Quality Index (Carbohydrate Quality Index (CQI)), the Fat Quality Index (Fat Quality Index (FQI)), and the Healthy Plate Protein source Quality Index (Healthy Plate Protein source Quality Index (HPPQI)). Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and Provegetarian Diet was evaluated using the Trichopoulou index and the score proposed by Martínez-González, respectively. cardiovascular disease (CVD) was defined as new-onset stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease (CVD) death.",0f5738e7-8c4d-4b52-9c09-46edb15955d3
1,methods1,"   Study population  The Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Project is a continuous, dynamic, multipurpose and prospective cohort [26]. All participants are university graduates, which reduces the potential confounding related to educational level and socioeconomic status, and increases the validity and reliability of the information [27]. Self-reported mailed and electronic questionnaires are collected at baseline and every 2 years to gather information related to socio-demographics, lifestyle, and medical history, including mortality and its causes. Participants who did not respond to any of the five follow-up mailings were contacted by email or phone. By December 2019, a total of 22,894 participants were enrolled in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort.",86019553-4705-460e-b865-91da181123cc
2,methods2," For these analyses, we excluded 341 participants recruited after March 2017 (to ensure a minimum follow-up of 2 years); 350 participants with prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD); 2,114 individuals with energy intake outside of predefined limits (men: < 800 or > 4,000 kcal/day; women: < 500 or > 3,500 kcal/day) [28]; and 1,671 participants without follow-up (retention rate 91.7%). Therefore, 18,418 participants were the basis for our analyses (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Flowchart of participants included in the study  Bioethics  Participants received written information about the information collected in the questionnaires, their privacy rights to protect their data, and future feedback of the finding of the project from the research team. Potential candidates were additionally informed about their right to refuse to participate or withdraw from the study at any time without reprisal, according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.",bfc99ea2-537f-4e2e-be19-ed571446cb33
3,methods3," Voluntary completion of the baseline questionnaire was considered as informed consent for participation in the study. The Research Ethics Committee of the University of Navarra approved the study. The Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02669602.  Dietary assessment  Baseline dietary information and after 10 years of follow-up was evaluated using a self-administered food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)). The questionnaire has been previously validated, and the reproducibility for the majority of foods and nutrients is good [29–31]. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) consists of 136 items and includes 9 food groups: (1) dairy products, (2) eggs, meat, and fish, (3) vegetables, (4) fruits, (5) legumes and cereals, (6) oils and fats, (7) pastries, (8) beverages and (9) miscellaneous.",d1f0f91f-b764-4965-b736-d6f97dd6b631
4,methods4," For each food, participants reported how often, on average, during the previous year they had consumed, specifying serving size with different options from “never or almost never” to “more than six times a day.”  Spanish food composition tables were used to calculate dietary intake, considering the daily intake of each food and the composition of nutrients [32, 33]. The ad hoc computer system was used to calculate the daily consumption of each food by multiplying the typical serving size by the frequency of consumption.  Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) assessment  As previously explained, the Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) was constructed based on three sub-indices, the Carbohydrate Quality Index (Carbohydrate Quality Index (CQI)), the Fat Quality Index (Fat Quality Index (FQI)), and the Healthy Plate Protein source Quality Index (Healthy Plate Protein source Quality Index (HPPQI)).",41d13bd2-3101-4f65-af7f-33f195aeebe6
5,methods5," The Carbohydrate Quality Index (CQI) has been used in previous cohort and trial studies to evaluate their association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) [34], plasma metabolomic profiles [35], and changes in cardiovascular risk factors [36]. The Carbohydrate Quality Index (CQI) is based on four equally weighted carbohydrate quality domains: glycemic index (GI), total dietary fiber intake (g/d), ratio of whole grains/ total cereals (whole grains + refined cereals + products prepared with refined flours), and the ratio of solid/total carbohydrates (liquids + solids).  The Fat Quality Index (FQI) has been used in nutritional adequacy [37] and cardiovascular disease (CVD) investigations [38].",bbcc21ee-71a7-4a59-ab16-6442630d9602
6,methods6," For the calculation of Fat Quality Index (FQI), monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), saturated fatty acids (SFA), and trans-fat acids (trans fat acids (TFA)) were taken into account as follows: Fat Quality Index (FQI) = (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) + polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA))/(saturated fatty acids (SFA) + trans fat acids (TFA)), receiving equally weighting.  Lastly, the Healthy Plate Protein source Quality Index (HPPQI) has been used in a previous study conducted by our group [24] and it was calculated based on the following ratio: Healthy Plate Protein source Quality Index (HPPQI) = (seafood + poultry + pulses + nuts)/(red and processed meats + cheese), considering the first food group as healthy sources of protein and the second group as unhealthy sources, according to the Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate [39].",32785135-8508-4bd7-abc2-3b8862cdf83c
7,methods7,"  To calculate the Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI), participants were classified into quintiles for each sub-index (Carbohydrate Quality Index (CQI), Fat Quality Index (FQI), and Healthy Plate Protein source Quality Index (HPPQI)), assigning values ranging from 1 (lowest quality) to 5 (highest quality). All the sub-index values were summed up, resulting in an Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) score ranging from 3 (poorest macronutrient quality) to 15 (highest macronutrient quality). Lastly, we classified participants into quartiles according to their total Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) score (Table 1).",952f25bb-ebdc-423c-9daa-66c23b4b8023

Ascertainment of cardiovascular disease (CVD)  cardiovascular disease (CVD) was the primary endpoint of our study and it was included inquired in by every self-reported follow-up questionnaire collected every 2 years. When the participant reported a cardiovascular disease (CVD) event, we requested the medical documentation and a team of cardiologists adjudicated the event, blinded to the dietary exposures.",1e713c35-99c5-486c-bc91-e0df6bd33a4b
12,methods12," The endpoint was a composite of acute myocardial infarction with or without ST elevation, stroke (both confirmed by a review of medical records with the prior permission of relatives), and cardiovascular death. Cardiovascular events were generally self-reported. Medical records of participants were requested to confirm cases and finally, cardiovascular events were confirmed by a cardiologist who was blind to diet and lifestyle exposure. Additionally, all potential cases were reviewed by a team of expert physicians. Nonfatal stroke was defined as a focal neurological deficit of sudden onset with a duration of more than 24 h and vascular mechanism. Diagnosis of myocardial infarction was defined using universal criteria [42]. Deceases from cardiovascular causes were confirmed by death certificates, medical records, or records linked to the National Institute of Statistics.",53bcab03-5277-4c51-af4a-f8a44d00072a
13,methods13," For participants lost during follow-up, we consulted the National Death Index of Spain at least once a year, to identify any member of the cohort who may have died.  Other covariates  Additional covariates include anthropometric measurements, habits related to health and lifestyle. The validity of self-reported anthropometric information (weight and height) has been previously evaluated in a subsample of the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort [43].

Proportions for categorical variables and means and standard deviation (SD) for quantitative variables were calculated.  Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the association between the quartiles of Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each quartile, considering Q1 as the reference category. The interpretation of HR > 1 was considered a higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, whereas HR < 1 was considered a lower probability of cardiovascular disease (CVD).",f03412e0-3f49-4af9-a8ea-84f8734b9e5a

17,analysis3,"  To minimize any effect of dietary variation, we used repeated measurements with updated data and cumulative diet average information of the Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) and its components, with a complete repetition of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) after 10 years of follow-up. For the analysis of repeated measures, the mean between the baseline food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and the 10 year food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (i.e., cumulative average exposure) was calculated to assess a more realistic diet based on the Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI).  We additionally evaluated the combined effects of adherence to the MedDiet and the Provegetarian dietary pattern with the Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI). For both indexes, participants were categorized into two groups (below and above the median), interpreted as “low adherence” and “high adherence”, respectively, while the Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) was categorized into three groups (Q1, Q2-Q3, and Q4).",409af3f5-dc41-461b-b51f-94f1d68e32d0

33,discussion0," Diet is a major determinant of health and life expectancy. Quality diets should recommend appropriate amounts and proportions of nutrient intake to help educate population about healthy choices. In the past years, a strong interest has emerged to design tools to assess the quality of the diet. The present study is the first to prospectively investigate the association between a novel and multidimensional Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Unlike other previous a priori indices, this Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) does not assess adherence to an eating pattern or dietary guideline, but it specifically appraises the global macronutrient quality and quantity. Thus, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) and MedDiet was 0.65.",17c95686-1c14-41a2-9ee3-a3767135b8d8
34,discussion1,"  As expected, participants with better Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) were healthier—had higher intakes of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, fish and seafood, white meats, skimmed dairy products, nuts, olive oil, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and fiber. These food groups contain high nutritional density and contain bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and oleocanthal that confer cardioprotective effects [11, 13]. Moreover, the consumption of these food groups provides additional functional properties such as low energy density and low glycemic, which may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [46–48]. Several studies have found that preference for whole grains over refined grains was associated with lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Whole grains preserve all the components (the bran, germ, and endosperm), which help decrease total cholesterol, LDL, body fat, and maintain adequate levels of postprandial glucose [49–52].",51e4e687-fe79-4d38-9483-c11ea4f6abb5
35,discussion2," A previous study in this cohort demonstrated an inverse association between better carbohydrate quality or a higher proportion of energy from better quality carbohydrates and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a higher proportion of carbohydrates from whole grains was strongly inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Moreover, the study suggested that replacing the amount of refined cereals with the same amount of whole grains and replacing bakery products or cookies with whole bread, the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was significantly reduced [34].  Dietary fat has been considered one of the most important modifiable factors associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [53]. The traditional recommendations to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been focused on saturated fatty acids (SFA) [22].",e06ea44b-6460-4572-9a13-6f7cc7438fda
36,discussion3," Currently, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)) suggest considering fats as part of healthy dietary patterns [12]. In our study, we found participants with higher Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) showed a higher percentage of energy coming from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and a lower percentage of energy from saturated fatty acids (SFA). This is consistent with previous findings of multiple studies in which lower intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) from fish, nuts, and vegetable oils such as olive oil, were associated with a lower incidence rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [22, 53–55]. The lower incidence rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) may be explained by the consequent decrease in LDL, which is well known to be the main causal factor in the development of atherosclerosis [56].",5127edc8-634e-41c5-acea-fab007f5c1bc
37,discussion4," Previous research in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort assessed the dietary quality of fats using the Fat Quality Index (FQI). This study did not find any association between a better fat quality diet and the risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). The authors concluded that a “heart-healthy diet” should focus on a general dietary pattern approach rather than limiting total fat intake or certain subtypes of fat [38].  In our study, we found that participants with higher consumption of red meat, whole dairy products, and eggs, had a lower Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI). However, epidemiological evidence of the long-term effects of higher protein intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) is not clear [57]. Previous findings have demonstrated that intake of vegetable protein from legumes, fruits, vegetables, and nuts was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).",271ff87e-0724-44ce-9fe6-72125e0b8b73
38,discussion5," Conversely, vegetable protein intake from cereals and potatoes was not associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [58, 59]. Animal protein, mainly red meat, has a high content of saturated fatty acids (SFA) that increases plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol [58, 59], which is linked to the etiopathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [17]. Therefore, the replacement of red meat by fish or poultry and the increase in the consumption of plant protein may produce positive cardioprotective effects [57]. Additionally, changing the proportion of animal protein by vegetable protein may lead to greater cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction due to the lower energy density of these foods, and consequently, a reduction in body weight, a major modifiable factor involved in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [57].  In this sense, Michas et al.",bd585bc3-7334-49f7-b392-caba6a41e81d
39,discussion6," [60] suggested that the total matrix of food is more important than just the content of certain nutrients to predicting the effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Thus, recommendations to improve the dietary quality should be oriented towards dietary patterns that have an adequate contribution of macronutrients, such as the MedDiet, and should not focus on isolated nutrients [61].  The benefits of MedDiet in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been reported in multiple studies [62]. Strong and robust evidence exists about the beneficial effects of the MedDiet on the prevention of chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to its high content of legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, and olive oil as the main fat, and its low content of meat products [62, 63].",6b25e10b-ff4f-4845-8233-62c84e7b584f
40,discussion7,"  The cardioprotective effects of the provegetarian pattern may be explained due to the high content of foods from plants, fruits, fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), lower intake of animal foods such as red and processed meats, and saturated fatty acids (SFA). These foods lead to positive outcomes such as reduction in lower blood pressure, LDL, inflammatory processes, and improvements in glycemic control [64]. This is supported by a recent meta-analysis with seven studies and 15,077 cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD), in which the authors concluded that greater adherence to the plant-based diet conferred cardiovascular disease (CVD) protection [65]. However, it is important to highlight that unhealthy plant-based diets may be associated with higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Lower intakes of unsaturated fats, micronutrients, antioxidants, dietary fiber, and higher intakes of added sugar and glycemic load may explain this detrimental association [66, 67].",6a08abee-4867-4e6a-bc7f-5483e5b43c2a
41,discussion8,"  Some limitations of the present study should be noted. First, our participants had a high level of education, and results may be considered non-representative of the general population. However, the generalizability of results should be based on biological mechanisms rather than statistical representativeness. Second, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was self-reported, which may lead to measurement errors. Nevertheless, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is a gold standard tool in nutritional epidemiology for assessing eating habits and has been repeatedly validated [23–25]. Third, residual confounding cannot be excluded, despite our models were adjusted for traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.",d0c4664c-1e44-497b-868f-fb5e9b0c76c8
42,discussion9," Fourth, it has not been possible to independently evaluate the association of Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) with fatal cardiovascular disease, due to the small number of fatal events (only 28) in our cohort, that precluded component-specific analyses for the composite cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcome. Finally, the Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) has not been formally validated to date. Although some food groups with cardio-protective properties were correlated with the Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI), the novelty of our findings is the more comprehensive nature of our approach that goes beyond assessing the amounts or proportions of each macronutrient in a particular diet and considers instead the overall quality of the three major macronutrients. In addition, this index is based on the best scientific evidence and it was previously used in other studies [24].",1133baaa-30e0-42d8-9a3c-f2fb4117805f
43,discussion10,"  The strengths of the study rely on its large sample size, the large follow-up period, the high retention rate (> 91%), the ability to control for a wide number of potential confounders, the blind confirmation of cardiovascular events by medical records which minimizes the potential misclassification bias, the use of repeated measurements of diet after 10 years of follow-up, the numerous sensitivity analyses, and the confirmation of deaths by the Spanish National Death Index.  Conclusions  In conclusion, in this Mediterranean cohort, we found a significant inverse relationship between a multidimensional Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Additionally, we found that better Macronutrient Quality Index (MQI) with greater adherence to MedDiet or the Provegetarian diet was also associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).",d9675071-144b-404f-8217-0c74421b58a7
44,discussion11,"  More research is needed to establish appropriate dietary guidelines about the quality of macronutrients to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk based on healthy dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean or the Provegetarian.
