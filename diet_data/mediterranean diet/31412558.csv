0,methods0,"This systematic review was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Protocols (Protocols (PRISMA)) format [16] (Figure 1). The study protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, no CRD42019141014). A Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes (Population Intervention Comparison and Outcomes (PICO)) statement was used to define the research question “Can intervention with diet, food or dietary supplements reduce disease activity in RA?” (Table S1).",42da41a9-fe6f-49f3-9158-b26bcd6ba39c
1,methods1,"  The inclusion criteria for this systematic review were articles that studied the following:Adults (≥18 years) with RA;  Randomized controlled trials—either parallel or crossover designs;  Both or either diet or dietary supplements, including whole diet, specific foods, spices, herbs, nutrients, dietary antioxidants and pre-, pro- or synbiotics;  Disease activity measured by Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 or Disease Activity Score (DAS) (see below) as an outcome of the intervention.    There were no limitations on study durations, dropout rates, participant gender or nutritional status. Dietary supplements were defined as formulations containing micronutrients, amino acids or fatty acids.",d18fb866-e22f-426a-b31e-b5d3c4b144b9
2,methods2,"  The exclusion criteria for this systematic review were as follows:Animal models;  Observational studies;  Non-randomized trials;  Trials that lack a control group or regimen, including those comparing high dose to low dose;  Results that were not peer reviewed, such as conference abstracts or publications in journals with no peer review process;  Studies on natural remedies of a traditional medicinal type or herbal remedies, or food extracts;  Studies that include other measures of disease activity than Disease Activity Score (DAS)/Disease Activity Score (DAS)28;  Studies of other types of rheumatic diseases, including juvenile idiopathic arthritis.    For the clinical assessment of disease activity in RA, the most commonly used instrument is Disease Activity Score (DAS)28.",b7542034-0d07-4a3a-8813-4a6cc8d14d75
3,methods3," Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 is a composite score that includes the status of 28 joints (tenderness and swelling), inflammation markers’ erythrocyte sedimentation rate (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) or C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) in combination with self-perceived health using a visual analogue scale (visual analogue scale (VAS)). A Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 score <2.6 indicates remission, 2.6–3.2 low disease activity, 3.2–5.1 intermediate disease activity and >5.1 high disease activity [17].  Data Collection and Processing The detailed search strategy is presented in Table S2. Searches (24 June 2019 and 21 March 2020) in the databases PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane library were performed by a trained librarian from the Biomedical Library at the University of Gothenburg, and delivered to the assessors in Rayyan. Two blinded assessors screened the abstracts, and articles that seemed to meet the criteria for inclusion were read in full length.",5b83a979-3c89-4bd9-a316-1adf0e8c2bec
4,methods4," Data were extracted using a pre-specified protocol. If data were presented from both intention to treat (intention to treat (ITT)) and per-protocol analyses, both results were extracted but intention to treat (ITT) was considered the primary analysis. If data on both Disease Activity Score (DAS)28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and Disease Activity Score (DAS)28-C reactive protein (CRP) were presented, both results were extracted but Disease Activity Score (DAS)28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was considered the main outcome variable.  The included articles were assessed in terms of quality using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality assessment tool for clinical trials according to the checklist by the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 5 working group [18].",248c0371-f47a-4528-a1aa-79bf04e9817a
5,methods5," The individual studies were graded as A (considered high-quality with low risk of bias and likely valid results), B (moderate quality, with some risk of bias) or C (low-quality with significant risk of bias that may invalidate the results). After quality review, the studies were grouped by intervention type and a summary of evidence was given to each group, using GRADE for RCT studies [19]. According to GRADE, the evidence was graded as very low (+), low (++), moderate (+++) or high (++++). Each intervention type was assessed for problems with bias, consistency in results between trials, relevance, precision and risk of publication bias. No meta-analysis was attempted as the study designs and results were expected to be too heterogeneous.  3. Results The searches resulted in a total of 1340 individual articles. Two additional articles were identified from references used by other articles.",28ad9a9d-95f7-46b1-8be6-d86b1c26580f
6,methods6," After screening the abstracts, 85 articles were read in full length, and 27 met the inclusion criteria and were included. The remaining 58 studies were excluded based on wrong outcome, abstract only, insufficient data presentation, no comparison to control group, dual publishing, wrong intervention, no true control group, not randomized or language other than English or Scandinavian (Figure 1). Summaries of the 27 included studies are shown in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Quality of evidence is summarized in Table 4.  3.1. Studies on Whole Diets, Foods or Meals Three RCT studies investigated the effects of whole diets (Mediterranean diet, uncooked vegan diet, and Anti-inflammatory Mediterranean style diet) on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28; two parallel trials [20,21] and one crossover trial [22]. All studies were performed in the Nordic region (Sweden and Finland), but were performed and written by different researchers.",144c8ed7-de86-47d6-9e49-0fd6a2bcb5e2
7,methods7," Intervention diets were provided, in part or in full, to the participants in all three studies, but only the study by Vadell et al. provided the same amount of foods to the control group. The remaining two studies provided either no food [21] or food in the initial phase [20] to the control group. In two of the studies, the participants in the control group were instructed to follow their habitual diet, while in the study by Vadell et al., the participants received a control diet that was based on the national average intake. The number of participants randomized in the studies varied from 43 to 56. Both genders were included but women were in the majority. At study baseline, disease activity was intermediate for all three studies. Sköldstam et al. found a significant improvement in Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 (effects on tender joints and C reactive protein (CRP)) when comparing the Mediterranean diet intervention to control diet (habitual diet) after 12 weeks. Vadell et al.",fe9f6f4e-57a0-45d4-b87e-c7d3f930dc2d
8,methods8," found tendencies towards positive effects after the 10 week Anti-inflammatory Mediterranean style diet intervention, but these were not significant in adjusted comparisons to the control diet [22]. Nenonen et al. found no effect on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 from the 12 week raw food vegan diet intervention [21]. The quality of the studies was high for the study by Vadell et al., intermediate for the study by Sköldstam et al., and low for the study by Nenonen et al. In sum, the quality of evidence that a Mediterranean style diet reduced Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in RA was considered moderate. The quality of evidence for effects of vegan, raw food diet was very low and too limited to draw any conclusions.  Two RCT studies investigated the effects of food items on disease activity—one parallel trial studying the intake of cranberry juice [23] and one crossover trial studying the intake of blue mussels [24]. The studies included 39 and 41 participants, all female.",94e4dac0-c9f2-4fd4-8c4f-e3c8873779e7
9,methods9," Lindqvist et al. compared the effect of one daily ready-to-eat meal (5 days/week) for 11 weeks, supplemented with either 75 g blue mussels or chicken/red meat [24]. Thimoteo et al. compared a usual diet supplemented with 500 mL/day low calorie cranberry juice to a usual diet, for 3 months [23]. The baseline disease activity was intermediate in both studies. Thimoteo et al. found no significant effect of Disease Activity Score (DAS)28. However, Lindqvist et al. found a decrease in Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in intention to treat (ITT) analysis (effects on general health), but not in per protocol analysis. The quality of both studies was intermediate. The quality of evidence that a daily consumption of blue mussels reduces Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in RA was considered low. Cranberry juice does not seem to reduce Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in RA (moderate quality of evidence).  3.2.",00aa7e7d-55b3-4611-8087-5f3ed6d7cb3b
10,methods10," Studies on Spices in High Doses Three studies investigated the effects of spices as capsules or tablets on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28. All three studies were conducted in Iran, by different research groups. The studies included 40–70 participants; all women, except for one study [25] that included 11% men. Aryaeian et al. compared 1.5 g/day ginger power in capsules to placebo capsules, in a three month parallel RCT [25]. Shishehbor et al. studied 2 g/day cinnamon power (Cinnamomum burmannii) in comparison to placebo capsules in a two month RCT [26]. Hamidi et al. compared 100 mg/day of saffron to placebo in a 3 month RCT [27]. All three studies showed significant improvement in Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in comparison to the placebo. Shishehbor et al. and Hamidi et al. both found effects on swollen joints, and the former also found an effect on C reactive protein (CRP) (Aryaeian et al. did not report results on the individual components of Disease Activity Score (DAS)28).",82e6f5e7-75a4-4561-95e6-d72504afec69
11,methods11," The studies were of high [26] and intermediate quality [25,27]. The quality of evidence was considered moderate that daily large doses of cinnamon, ginger, and saffron reduces Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in RA.  3.3. Studies on n-3 Fatty Acid Supplements Five studies investigated the effects of fatty acid supplements for 2.5–4 months on disease activity in RA. The studies included predominately women. The interventions were heterogeneous and the n-3 fatty acids were delivered in different vehicles. Galaragga et al. provided 97 participants with either placebo or capsules with 10 g/day cod liver oil for 12 weeks [28]. Das Gupta gave their 100 participants 3 mg/d of n3-fatty acids in capsules in addition to drug Indomethiacin, while controls received only the drug for 12 weeks [29]. In 2018, Dawcynski et al. provided their 38 participants with either foods enriched with 2.36 mg/d of n3-fatty acids from a micro algae, or with conventional foods for 10 weeks [30].",ae15175f-e60f-4ea0-a9ad-a5955ecbb624
12,methods12," In 2009, Dawcynski et al. compared 2.4 g/day of n3-fatty acids in the form of enriched dairy products to commercial dairy products in 45 patients with RA [31]. Remans et al. gave their 66 participants either a liquid nutritional supplement containing 1.7 g/d of n3 PUFA (EPA, DHA, DPA and ALA), other macro- and micronutrients (specified) or a placebo drink [32]. At baseline, disease activity was intermediate or high. Only one [29] of the studies showed a significant effect on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in comparison to control (effects on swollen and tender joints). The study quality was intermediate for all studies. Overall, the studies showed no effect of 1.7–3 g/d of n-3 fatty acids on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 (low quality evidence).  3.4. Studies on Vitamin D Supplements Two studies investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on disease activity in RA, in comparison to placebo. The studies included 22–150 participants, predominately women.",be31f951-f835-4bcd-94c6-cc746e1cefc3
13,methods13," The study duration was 3 months in one study [33], and 12 months in the other [34]. In both studies, very large doses of vitamin D were given, and the effect was compared to placebo in the control group. Buondonno et al. used a single dose of 7500 µg of vitamin D3 (calculated as average per day of follow up, 83 µg/day) [33]. Hansen et al. intervened with three weekly doses of 1250 µg/week of vitamin D2 (corresponding to 180 µg/day), followed by two monthly doses of 1250 µg (corresponding to 83 µg/day) for month 2–11. Both the intervention group and the control group received 1500 mg/d of calcium [34]. The baseline disease activity was low in the study by Hansen et al. and high in the study by Buondonno et al. None of the studies found an effect of vitamin D on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28, compared to control. Study quality was intermediate [33] and low [34]. Overall, the studies showed no effect of vitamin D supplementation on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 (low quality evidence).",dc6c441b-57d9-44bc-b437-447e1892f4a2
14,methods14,"  3.5. Studies on Other Micronutrients Rastmanesh et al. compared 6 g/day of potassium in the form of enriched grape juice to conventional grape juice among 38 hypokalemic women with RA in a parallel study design [35]. The baseline disease activity was high. After one month, there was a significant reduction in Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in the intervention group compared to control (effects on tender and swollen joints, C reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and general health). The quality of the study was considered intermediate. The strength of evidence that potassium in the form of enriched juice reduces Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in hypokalemic women with RA was considered low.  Shishavan et al. randomized 64 female participants with RA in remission either 10 µg/day of vitamin K1 as a chewable tablet, or placebo [36]. After two months, there was no significant difference in Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 between the groups.",e02b58e8-2dcd-4aff-95e3-43a7b85cbd70
15,methods15," The study was considered to be of high quality. The strength of evidence was considered low that vitamin K reduce Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in RA.  Van Ede et al. compared 1 mg/day folic acid or 2.5 mg/week of folinic acid, in addition to Methotrexate, to placebo among 434 women (71%) and men [37]. All three groups received Methotrexate treatment, and folinic or folic acid were given in order to study the effects on efficacy and toxicity. At baseline, disease activity was intermediate. Neither folic nor folinic acid had any effect on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28. The study was considered to be of intermediate quality. Based on this study, folic or folinic acid do not reduce Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in RA (moderate quality of evidence).  3.6.",57b6e231-4c23-4912-89d4-013ff1c58ffe
16,methods16," Studies on Single Antioxidants Four studies from Iran or Egypt, from different research groups, investigated the effects of single antioxidants on disease activity in RA; in three of the studies the effect was compared to placebo [38,39,40] and in one the effect was compared to regular treatment [41]. The antioxidant interventions lasted two–three months and comprised of 1200 mg/d alpha lipolic acid [38], 500 mg/d quercetin [39], 1 g/d resveratrol [41] and 100 mg/d ubiquinone [40]. There were 50–100 participants per study, predominately women.  Gargari found no effect on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 of alpha lipolic acid, in comparison to placebo, in a study of patients mainly in remission [38].",1d137e9c-aaaa-455c-ba32-242cdf174e2e
17,methods17," However, the three other studies found significant improvements in Disease Activity Score (DAS)28, compared to placebo, from quercetin [39] (no significant effects on individual components), resveratrol [41] (effect on swollen and tender joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP)) and ubiquinone [40] (effects on swollen and tender joint) in patients with intermediate to high disease activity. The studies were considered to be of high [38] and intermediate quality [39,40,41]. The strength of evidence that alpha lipolic acid does not reduce disease activity in RA was considered moderate. The quality of evidence for the positive effects on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in RA was considered moderate for quercetin and ubiquinone, and low for resveratrol.  3.7. Studies on Pre-, Pro- and Synbiotics Five studies investigated the effects of pre-, [42] pro- [43,44,45] and synbiotics [46] on disease activity in RA.",d4dd4fcd-f96e-4b31-bab2-f1bee4925585
18,methods18," All but two studies were conducted in Iran and two studies were from the same research group [44,46].  Alavi et al. compared a prebiotic supplement providing 1.3 g/day of fiber (aloe vera gel extract, arabinogalactan, gum ghatti, gum tragacanth, glucosamine) to control (rice flour) in 78 women and men with RA with intermediate disease activity. After six months, Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 was significantly worsened in the intervention group, compared to control. However, this difference was due to an improvement in the control group. The study quality was considered low [42].  Alipour et al. compared one daily capsule of L. casei 01 (108 colony forming units) and maltrodextrin to maltrodextrin alone, among 60 women with RA. At baseline, the mean Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 indicated remission.",9c20c417-96e9-4960-85d7-3f76de4b2f62
19,methods19," After two months, the Disease Activity Score (DAS)28-C reactive protein (CRP) was lower in the intervention group compared to the control group [43] (effects on all individual components of Disease Activity Score (DAS)28). Study quality was considered intermediate.  In 2016, Zamani et al. compared a placebo (starch) to probiotic capsules containing L. casei (2 × 109 colony forming units), L. Acidophilus (2 × 109 colony forming units) and B. Bifidum (2 × 109 colony forming units). The study was conducted among 60 women and men for two months. The baseline disease activity was intermediate. After two months, the probiotic intervention reduced Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 in comparison to placebo (effects on C reactive protein (CRP)) [44]. The study quality was considered high.  Pineda et al. compared two daily capsules of probiotics containing 2 × 109 of L. Rhamnous and L. Reuteri, in addition to inactive ingredients, to placebo (same ingredients but without the bacteria).",fc6f2851-09f4-4c2b-a4ea-3d0d30131cd1
20,methods20," The study included 29 patients, both men and women, and the disease activity at baseline was intermediate. After three months, there was no significant difference in disease activity between intervention and control [45]. The quality of the study was intermediate.  In 2017, Zamani et al. compared a synbiotic supplement containing the same probiotics as their previous trial in addition to 800 mg of inulin. The control group received placebo (starch). The study included 54 women and men, and the baseline disease activity was intermediate. After two months, disease activity was significantly reduced in the synbiotic group, in comparison to control (effects on C reactive protein (CRP)) [46]. The study quality was considered high.  Prebiotic fiber supplementation does not seem to reduce Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in RA (low quality evidence).",462a6a1c-257d-4ae8-b327-ef7e7eafe98f
21,methods21," The strength of evidence was considered low that probiotic supplementation, with and without the addition of prebiotics, reduces Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in RA. The evidence that probiotics containing L. casei improve disease activity compared to control was considered moderate.  4. Discussion This systematic review included 33 RCT studies of diet or dietary supplements that reduce the disease activity of RA. The evidence was considered moderate that a Mediterranean style diet, ginger powder, cinnamon, saffron, quercetin, ubiquinone and probiotics containing L. casei reduce Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in RA. The evidence was considered moderate that cranberry juice, folic acid and alpha lipoic acid do not reduce Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 in RA. The evidence for other interventions was very low or low, with only indicative effects. Most findings have never been verified in subsequent trials, making the strength of evidence limited.",afe633a3-8a1a-4407-8a54-b04704bb481b
22,methods22," Consequently, there is a great need to confirm previous positive findings in order to conclude weather diet or dietary supplements can be used as adjuvant treatments to reduce disease activity in RA.  Dietary components can affect disease activity in RA through several direct or indirect interactions with the immune system. Long chain n-3 fatty acids found in fish can decrease the production of inflammatory eicosanoids, adhesion molecules and cytokines [47]. Antioxidants can reduce oxidative stress and thereby possibly symptoms and inflammation in RA [48]. In addition, dietary fiber, prebiotics or probiotics could have beneficial effects on disease activity in RA through modification of the microbiota [49]. Specific nutrients and alterations to microbiota can also affect the intestinal permeability, which may affect the immune response.",ad0bf701-a0fc-4eb1-a912-0d0a9288754c
23,methods23," Lastly, weight loss from dietary intervention could be beneficial for patients with RA, as obesity is associated with the more rapid progression of disabilities [50], but energy deficiency could also put patients at risk of malnutrition [51].  The findings from the current study indicate some positive effects of the Mediterranean diet that combines several of these factors, such as n3-fatty acids, fibre and dietary antioxidants [11]. The null effects from most of the n-3 fatty acid supplement interventions included in the current systematic review suggest that supplementation may be ineffective, despite doses of n-3 fatty acids unattainable through diet alone. The supplemented fatty acids will only contribute with a very small proportion of the total daily fat intake. The effect of manipulating the total fat quality of the diet is unclear and warrants further investigation.",4a6f6ba1-dffb-484c-8eab-2dc436b5ee12
24,methods24," The findings of this review also show potentially beneficial effects from the supplements containing single antioxidants and spices with high antioxidant capacity. Antioxidant supplementation has been associated with both beneficial and adverse effects in many health conditions [52,53,54], and the safety of long-term high dose intake is uncertain. The doses of vitamin D given in the included studies, though ineffective in reducing disease activity, exceed the tolerable upper intake limit set by the European Food Safety Authority [55]. The doses given of spices in the included studies—approximately one teaspoon/day—might be achievable through diet alone. It is however noteworthy that this dose approximately corresponds to the tolerable daily intake for consumption of cinnamon, to avoid a toxic intake of coumarin [56]. Overall, high dose supplementation with nutrients, spices or antioxidants should be initiated with caution as adverse effects are possible.",3fe004ad-ff4a-4577-8fd3-19f34b4752fd
25,methods25,"  Most of the included studies had study durations of two to four months. This seems sufficient to see changes in Disease Activity Score (DAS)28, according to the findings. Heterogeneity was observed in regards to which component of Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 was affected, as positive effects seemed to be mediated through different factors (inflammation, joint status or self-reported health) in different studies. All studies also included mostly or exclusively female participants, likely due to the overrepresentation of RA among women. However, most of the other aspects of study design, such as baseline disease activity, pharmacological treatment, disease duration, sample size and intervention, varied substantially between studies. These considerable heterogeneities in study design makes it difficult to summarize the results. This was expected, and therefore no meta-analysis was attempted.",7424da29-bd25-4bbd-a4be-a85d78ad09a5
26,methods26,"  A 2009 Cochrane review concluded that the effects of dietary intervention in RA are uncertain due to insufficient evidence [15]. Our conclusions for only Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 are similar, thus the evidence has not improved in the last 11 years despite new publications. This is in part due to a lack of significant results in recent dietary intervention trials, but also due to a lack of new dietary intervention studies. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis found no effects on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 of n3-fatty acid supplementation [57], in line with our findings. However, other effects of n3-fatty acid supplementation were observed in the previous review, such as reduced inflammatory cytokines or improved blood lipid profile. Previous systematic reviews have found some indications of positive effects from diet on RA, other than on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28.",9f4f9abe-aa71-42e8-b797-4983cf1267e1
27,methods27," These effects include the positive effects on pain and physical function of the Mediterranean diet [58], and on pain and improvement rates of fasting followed by vegetarian diet [59], but no evidence for effects of n-fatty acids or Mediterranean diet on fatigue [60]. The effects of diet on subjective outcomes such as pain and self-reported physical function are not unexpected from interventions that are difficult to blind, and where placebo effects may contribute significantly. Therefore, the relevance of these findings is unclear.  There was moderate strength of evidence for positive effects of probiotics containing L. casei, with or without prebiotics. This contradicts a 2017 meta-analysis that found no effect of probiotics on Disease Activity Score (DAS) [61], but with only partially the same studies included. The probiotics used in the studies included in the current systematic review comprised of different combinations of bacteria, but L. casei was used in most.",08e52850-22cc-405f-a4ae-4a990f55a773
28,methods28," As the results from the studies that used dietary probiotics did not show significant improvements in Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 [21,22], supplemental doses may be required. In addition, the bacteria strains in the supplemental studies were different from those in the diet interventions.  Limitations and Strengths A limitation of this work is the lack of outcomes other than Disease Activity Score (DAS)28. Other outcomes were excluded in order to make a comprehensible summary of results, while still enabling the inclusion of a broad range of interventions. Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 was chosen as the outcome as it is the most relevant assessment of disease activity in RA, and is used in clinical praxis. Still, including studies with other indicators of disease activity would have yielded a few more studies, but also would have complicated the interpretation of the results. Including other indicators of disease activity would also have meant the inclusion of mainly older studies.",d3269de9-b1c1-4bc6-952b-539f58d63f04
29,methods29," Choosing Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 as the outcome ensures results from current, relevant populations that have access to modern pharmacological treatment. Another possible limitation is that we only considered between-group differences in Disease Activity Score (DAS)28. However, Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 varies over time, and in studies that utilize a minimum threshold for inclusion, regression to the mean is to be expected. Therefore, within-group effects can be due to the natural fluctuations, rather than true effects. Other limitations are associated with the lack of high-quality studies, such as the lack of intention to treat (ITT) analysis in the included papers, which means that the effects from single studies are likely inflated. The power was likely insufficient to detect significant effects in some of the studies, though most based their sample size on a priori power calculations.",a29bf7f7-85ff-469d-8610-224ac49740cc
30,methods30," As few experiments have been reproduced, there is also a risk of publication bias where non-significant findings have not been reported. An indication of publication bias is the 13 conference abstracts identified in the searches that never seemed to have resulted in a published paper.  The strengths of this work include the use of two blinded assessors for article selection, quality assessment and data extraction. When one assessor had co-authored an included paper, a third blinded assessor performed quality assessment to ensure a fair appraisal. In addition, a skilled librarian performed all searches in three databases, safeguarding high quality searches that would include all relevant papers.  5. Conclusions Based on the available results from RCT studies, evidence for the effects of specific diets, food items, spices, micronutrients, antioxidants and pre-, pro- and synbiotics on Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 is limited.",437a11a0-6e09-4aff-9722-47db3f75b0ef
