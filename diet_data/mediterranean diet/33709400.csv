0,methods0," 2.1. Selection of Participants and Study Design  A cross-sectional descriptive study based on a self-administered questionnaire was carried out. It was a non-probabilistic sample used for convenience since the questionnaire was directed towards people of legal age (≥18 years old) from the university community recruited online. The collection of information began on 28 April 2020; 46 days after lockdown had begun (Phase 1) and the last data were sent on 29 May 2020.  For a correct collection of the information, a Google form application which allows the anonymity of the participants was used. The questionnaire was directed towards the entire university community (students, teachers and administrative staff), by email.",dd760acd-336d-4a50-981a-4d16251cff4f
1,methods1," After agreeing to complete the questionnaire, participants were asked to answer the questions of the self-administered online questionnaire, with all answers mandatory, (in a time of less than 30 min) informing them that they could interrupt the compilation at any time, without the obligation of justifying their decision. Participation in the study was voluntary and completely free.  The study was approved by the Committee of Ethics of Investigation of the Universidad Europea del Atlántico (C-12/2020), and all the anonymously compiled information was treated with maximum confidentiality in accordance with the law for Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights 3/2018 of 5 December 2018 [33].",9ba418f6-042b-43ec-b08b-54df2427062b

Instrument and Variables  Within the questionnaire, information was organized in 3 sections. A first section (25 items) included the sociodemographic profile: sex, age range, birthplace, cohabitation with other people, place of residence during confinement, position in the University and, for students, the faculty and degree program. They were also asked for their height in meters, their weight before confinement and how many kilograms their weight had changed during confinement.",7217e18e-a3c5-4860-bdbc-4f818813331a
3,methods3," Both height and weight were self-referenced, the participants were asked to include their usual weight before confinement and if this had changed, to indicate the kilograms gained or lost.  Dietary behavior and physical activity habits were described in the second section (17 items) with questions about grocery shopping, number of meals, change in consumption of fruit, vegetables, dairy products, pulses, fish/seafood, white meat, red meat and processed meat, pastries and snacks, rice/pasta/potatoes, nuts, alcoholic drinks and sugary drinks, based on the healthy eating pyramid [35]. To establish changes in consumption, participants were asked whether their consumption of the different food groups had decreased, remained the same or increased. To establish changes in physical activity, participants were also asked whether their activity had decreased, remained the same or increased during confinement.",52892982-5721-4376-a0b4-d6d4367739c9
4,methods4," In all cases they were asked to compare their usual habits before confinement with their habits at the current time of confinement.  A third section included a semiquantitative questionnaire of adhesion to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) (MEDAS-14) [36] and a validated questionnaire of emotional eating “The Emotional Eater Questionnaire” (Emotional Eater Questionnaire (EEQ)) [37]. MEDAS-14 was assessed on the continuous scale (0–14 points) classifying the participants into low (<5 points), medium (6 to 8 points) and high (>9 points) adherence levels [36], while Emotional Eater Questionnaire (EEQ) was assessed on the continuous scale (0–30 points), classifying the participants into non-emotional eater (0–5 points), low emotional eater (6–10 points), emotional eater (11–20 points) and very emotional eater (21–30 points) [37].",7f67faf6-ad43-4b9b-9ad2-ee806cb785f0
5,methods5,"  A pilot study was carried out among 15 subjects to verify the effectiveness of the questionnaire to learn if it provided the necessary information or if any of the questions needed to be modified.  A total of 170 completed questionnaires were received and two of them were eliminated because they both consisted of the same data in all the answers. Thus, 168 questionnaires were considered valid.  2.3. Statistical Analysis  Normal distribution for quantitative variables was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk normality test. The quantitative variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) or as median accompanied by their interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)), as appropriate. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was distributed using World Health Organization (WHO) ranges classification.",a0c8cb2b-c293-4c8b-a08b-9f5cad9f30cf
6,methods6,"  The following variables were regrouped to establish more robust results: MEDAS-14 (Low adherence and Medium/High), Body mass index (BMI) (Under/Normal weight and Pre-obesity/Obesity I and II) and EQQ (Non-emotional/Low emotional eater and Emotional/Very emotional eater).  For the quantitative variables, the Student’s test or non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test was used. Univariate comparisons were investigated between groups and explicative variables using Pearson X2. The criterion of significance was established at p < 0.05. All computer data were analyzed using “The jamovi project (2021). jamovi. (Version 1.8) [Computer Software].

Results  3.1. Characterization of the Sample Population  Two thirds (66.7%) of the participants were women, 79.2% from Spain, students (76.8%), living in the family home (76.2%) and in the range of age of 21–35 years (47.6%). The Body mass index (BMI), calculated with the weight prior to the lockdown, showed that 7.1% were underweight, 66.1% of the sample had a normal weight, while the 26.8% were pre-obese or had some type of obesity.  Analyzed by role, there were students (79.8%), Research Professors (R.P) (14.9%) and Administrative Staff (A.S) (8.3%). Students were from the Faculty of Health and Science (65.9%), Faculty of Social and Humanity Sciences (27.1%) and Higher Polytechnic School (7%).",6a088051-0c0c-473b-8d76-2a44df612b82
8,methods9,"  To analyze weight changes during the lockdown, it was decided to use weight variation (weight increased in kg/weight before de confinement); 1 meant that the current weight was maintained, <1 implied a weight reduction and >1 a weight gain. In general, our population maintained or increased weight (mean of 0.99 ± 0.03). Non-statistically significant differences were found in weight variation comparing women (median: 1.00; interquartile range (IQR): 0.043) and men (median: 1.00; interquartile range (IQR): 0.050) (p = 0.507) and comparing the origin of our population between Spain (median: 1.00; interquartile range (IQR): 0.040) and others (median: 1.00; interquartile range (IQR): 0.054) (p = 0.493). However, between Students (median: 1.00; interquartile range (IQR): 0.038) and UE (Research Professor and Administrative Staff) (median: 1.01; interquartile range (IQR): 0.029), significant differences were found between the two groups (p < 0.05) using the Mann–Whitney U test. (Figure 1).",ac903b96-0031-47de-9aca-dba4fc06161d
9,methods10,"  Specifically for students, non-statistically significant differences were found, comparing the Degree of Human Nutrition (median: 1.00; interquartile range (IQR): 0.016) versus others (median 1.00; interquartile range (IQR): 0.044) (p = 0.828) and comparing by Faculty of Health Sciences (median: 1.00; interquartile range (IQR): 0.040) versus others (median: 1.00; interquartile range (IQR): 0.038) (p = 0.910) using the Mann–Whitney U test.  3.2. Confinement Effect on Dietary and Physical Activity Behavior  To highlight how lockdown affected the dietary behavior of the population, individuals were questioned about the changes in their habits and dietary pattern compared to the preceding period (Table 2). Completed data can be found in Table S3, on the supplementary material.  During lockdown, most of the evaluated population did the grocery shopping once or less per week (76.8%) and cooked more than usual (73.2%). Consumption remained the same of fruit (45.2%; CI 37.5–53.",a9088b1f-f76c-471f-929b-17c463f32083

Completed data can be found in Table S3.  Comparing by sex, significant differences were found: women did the grocery 1 time or less per week (16%) more than men (p < 0.05); and women increased the consumption of fish/seafood (15.9%) more than men (p < 0.05); non-significant differences were found in the remaining questions, although close to significant differences were found in the numbers of meals per day with an increase of (17.9%) in women (p = 0.077) (Table 3).  3.3.

11,methods15," Discussion  The spread of COVID-19 around the world forced governments to make very restrictive decisions [38]. In the case of Spain, a strict confinement of the entire population was imposed on 14 March 2020, which limited mobility [4]. Being forced to stay indoors for a long time can dramatically change our eating habits and physical activity practices [10,26,39,40]. Lockdown was an unpleasant experience for everyone, especially for those who lived alone [41,42]. Job uncertainty, loneliness and fear of illness [43,44], besides the closure of schools, work activities, social distance and the ban of physical activities, radically disrupted the concept of normality [39,40]. In this work, we have analyzed these modifications in a population sample from the university community of the Universidad Europea del Atlántico located in Santander, Cantabria, Spain.",b86bfa6f-7c8b-4ed3-aee7-e788f8ffe166
12,methods16," To our knowledge this is the first study that has analyzed differences between staff and students in a Spanish college population and which analyzed how confinement affects the population of students and staff in the same university in terms of eating habits, physical activity and emotional eating. The main findings of this study were the significant differences in weight gain between students and university staff (p < 0.05), significant differences in the consumption of dairy products, with a decrease of (12.9%) in the group of students (p < 0.05), consumption of pastries and snacks stayed the same, being (30.7%) more in the UE group versus student’s group (p < 0.01); consumption of low alcohol drinks (wine and beer), decreased by (31.5%) in the group of students (p < 0.05) and physical activity increased by (17.2%) in the group of students (p < 0.001). As for adherence to MD (20.8%), our population had a low level of adherence to MD. Finally, (27.",16fbd3c6-5cec-45b4-add9-f18577ed47d9
13,methods17,"4%) of our population were emotional/Very emotional eaters, with significantly higher values in women (p < 0.01).  Before lockdown, the prevalence of subjects who were overweight or obese was 26.8% lower compared to the data reported for the Spanish population by Sánchez-Sánchez et al. [11], who found an incidence of 39.8%, and similar to the data reported by Sidor et al. [7] for the Polish population. It should be noted that in this case, the distribution of subjects who were overweight or obese also coincided with those of our sample. The incidence in our sample was also lower compared to the data reported for the Chilean (52.2%) [45] and Dutch (55.6%) [46] populations. This may be due to the average age of our population which was mostly made up of students. In general, weight variations were observed in the participants: 36.3% weight loss and a 35.7% weight gain with significant differences between students and UE respectively.",82f73c71-15f9-4e36-ad79-705dbee11f3f
14,methods18," Weight loss was observed more in students than in UE (p < 0.05) and no correlation was found between Body mass index (BMI) and weight gain/loss. Our results show a percentual lower weight gain in the population than those found in Sinisterra-Loaiza [28], Sidor et al. [7] and Sánchez-Sánchez et al. [11], who reported a weight loss in obese people during confinement as in Di Renzo et al. [27]. However, it is consistent with the weight gain reported in Celorio-Sardá et al. [30]; Reyes-Olavarria et al. [45] and Deschasaux-Tanguy et al. [9]. It is interesting to note that no differences were found between health science students and the rest of the university population.",b3677d72-c234-4049-83e2-f19006c4277a
15,methods19,"  Regarding the dietary and lifestyle adaptations during lockdown in our populations, the consumption of fruits, vegetables, dairy, pulses, fish/seafood, white meat, red and processed meat, pastries and snacks, rice/pasta/potatoes, nuts, low alcohol drinks, spirits and sugary drinks, number of meals per day and physical activity decreased or stayed the same. The only item that increased was the frequency of cooking during confinement. These results are similar to those found by Rodríguez-Pérez et al. [43] and contrary to those found by Sánchez-Sánchez et al. [11], who reported an increase in the consumption of alcoholic beverages, and Celorio-Sardá et al. [30] who reported an increased consumption in fruit, vegetables, legumes, fish, eggs and yogurt. We can conclude that most of our population did not change their eating habits during confinement, similar to the results found in 1932 Italian adults by Scarmozzino et al. [10] and Brancaccio et al. [26] and by Poelman et al.",119665cd-b93c-4de9-8bb5-722fb9bd1899
16,methods20," [46] in 1030 Dutch adults. The decrease in the consumption of pastries and snacks is contrary to what was found in French population by Marty et al. [8].  Because of the significant differences found in weight variation, we analyzed differences between students and UE in dietary and lifestyle adaptations. Significant differences were found in dairy products and low alcohol drinks (where students decreased their consumption more), pastries and snacks (where UE stayed the same) and physical activity (where UE decreased it more). Vegetable consumption also showed an increase, although not significant in the student group. These results are consistent with the results shown by Celorio-Sardá et al. [30] who reported an increased consumption in yogurt and vegetables and decreased consumption in fermented alcoholic beverages, especially in students.  Two key elements of good health are both healthy eating and physical exercise. During the confinement, 36.",43857c5e-9afe-480a-8ce7-c0ae03555405
17,methods21,"3% of our population increased their physical activity. Our results are similar, although higher, to those reported by Rodríguez-Pérez et al. [47], Di Renzo et al. [27] and somewhat lower than those found by Celorio-Sardá et al. [30], contrary to those of Romero-Blanco et al. [31] who found that all groups increased their physical activity on average, while in our study significant differences were found between students and UE, who were the ones who decreased their physical activity by the highest percentage (66.7% vs. 44.7%).  During the COVID-19 pandemic, following the MD pattern was recommended due to its ability to stimulate the immune system [19,20]. According to Pérez-Araluce et al. [48], a better adherence to this pattern may be associated with a lower risk of COVID-19.",f34351f1-b261-4257-a72b-d69ee611de6c
18,methods22," The MD, considered an example of a healthy balanced diet, is characterized by the intake of olive oil, fresh fruits and vegetables [49] which are associated to the reduction of inflammatory stress markers, improvement in lipid profile and insulin sensitivity. These effects are attributable to the phenolic compounds and mono and poly-unsaturated fatty acids they contain [20,50,51]. Our data show that 79.2% of the population had Medium/High adherence to the MD (MEDAS-14) during confinement, which is much higher than the 8% reported by Sánchez-Sánchez et al. [11] for the Spanish population. Comparing by role, UE had the worst results, contrary to what was found by Rodríguez-Pérez et al. [47] and León-Muñoz et al. [51]. Our results could be explained by the fact that among the youngest participants in our study the majority belong to the Faculty of Health Sciences, where they are constantly encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle.",eea595fc-5906-4aef-8e21-2207e56238a2
19,methods23," Among the students, a significant difference was found with a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet by the students of the Degree in Human Nutrition and Dietetics (96% Moderate/high adherence), which agrees with the data by Celorio-Sardá et al. [30], who found that nutrition students were the ones who most improved their eating habits during confinement.  The restrictions of confinement, explained above, have been linked to an increase in mental illness, especially depression and anxiety [52]. In this sense, different authors relate an increase in anxiety linked to emotional eating [53,54].  According to the results of the Emotional Eater Questionnaire (EEQ), most of the participants were categorized as non/low-emotional eaters (72.6%), similar to the data reported by López-Moreno M et al. [55] for Spanish adults (67.2%). Women scored significantly higher than men as emotional/very emotional eaters (35.7% vs. 10.7%) (p < 0.01). Similar results were obtained by Di Renzo L et al.",2c98440a-d081-47ea-a77d-05ec6da57ae6
20,methods24," [39], who reported that women were more prone to emotional eating than men and no differences were found by age range groups. Social isolation imposed during the COVID 19 pandemic could pose a psychological burden for many individuals, but, for women, who continue to carry the burden of household chores in our current models of society, this led to eating more frequently or in greater quantities as a mechanism for coping with increasing fear and anxiety. It is known that during prolonged stress, our body releases cortisol, which increases the feeling of hunger [56].  This study has several limitations. The cross-sectional design does not provide any information on the possible causal nature and has inherent recall error as participants were asked to recall their responses before lockdown and the data obtained depends on the participants’ memory; also, self-reported questionnaires are prone to underreporting and susceptible to biased information.",12ae443e-88a2-4896-b537-cb9ac1670ee1
21,methods25," Our sample size is too small to be representative, this causes the results to have more variability which could lead to bias and, therefore, the conclusions cannot be extrapolated. The distribution among genders and age range groups is inadequate. Due to the exceptional nature of the situation and the data to be analyzed, there are no validated questionnaires that capture variation in food consumption during a lockdown situation. The lack of a validated questionnaire can omit relevant information and raise the problem of generalization of results. Future studies should consider whether the effects of these lockdowns has caused long-term consequences on eating and physical behavior. It would also be interesting to validate a questionnaire for emergency isolation situations that could be applied in possible future pandemic situations.  5.",991fb989-7719-426a-a4b2-03c894c40e3f
22,methods26," Conclusions  We can affirm that under the lockdown caused by COVID-19, the UNEAT community decreased or maintained the same dietary and lifestyle habits; students increased the intake of fruits and vegetables and physical activity compared with UE, whereas UE, during lockdown, increased the intake of low alcohol drinks (wine and beer). As mentioned before, fruits and vegetables are the principal source of bioactive compounds that help to maintain a state of health and could be a therapeutic approach to COVID-19.  In addition, our sample limited the consumption of pastries and snacks, sugary drinks, and alcoholic beverages, had a Medium/High adherence to the MD and practiced physical exercise regularly. This resulted in a reduction or maintenance of weight, especially in the youngest subjects in the community. In an exceptional situation such as a pandemic scenario, it is difficult to establish a bidirectional relationship between foods and mood.",e706869f-a613-44b4-a2b4-4fc544844460
23,methods27," In any case, in our sample, women were more likely to be emotional eaters than men, eating for reasons other than hunger, and increasing the intake of more palatable foods.  Future strategies should be implemented to promote a balanced and healthy diet, especially improving the consumption of fruits and vegetables, together with the practice of physical activity, for the entire University population, and for the UE, who increased weight more during lockdown.
