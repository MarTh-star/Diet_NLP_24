1,methods0," Study population  The cohort consisted of 155 subjects from the Paediatric Urology unit of Fondazione IRCCS Ca′ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan, Italy (Fig. 1). They were referred to the clinic for corrective elective surgery and did not show evidence of acute, chronic, or inflammatory disease. Fig. 1 Flow chart of the cohort  Blood sample preparation  Venous blood was collected on Whatman 903 chromatography paper (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) prepared with the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)) (Fluka, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA) as reported [19]. The chromatography paper with collected blood was kept in a sealed envelope with desiccant at 4° before delivery to the laboratory pending analysis at − 20 °C.",b48aaa53-90a6-41ae-9e9d-35d5c2cf74fe
2,methods1,"  Fatty acids  Select FA are shown, for their abundance and/or biological activity: palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) of the SFA; oleic acid (C18:1n9) of the MUFA; Alpha linolenic acid (ALA) (C18:3n3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C20:5n3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6n3) of the n-3 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA); LA (C18:2n6), Dihomo gamma linolenic acid (DGLA) (C20:3n6), and AA (C20:4n6) of the n-6 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA). Several indices were calculated: the inflammatory state ratios AA/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), AA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and n6/n3 [20], the polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) balance marker (%eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + %docosahexaenoic acid (DHA))/total polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) × 100, and estimated enzymatic activity from product and substrate ratios: SCD(18) (C18:1n9/C18:0), FADS2 (Dihomo gamma linolenic acid (DGLA)/LA, and FADS1 (AA/Dihomo gamma linolenic acid (DGLA)).

3,methods2," In brief, blood spot FAs were transmethylated with 3 N Methanol-HCL (Supelco, Steinheim, Germany) for 1 h at 90 °C. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were extracted with hexane (Honeywell, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA) and analysed by gas chromatography Nexis GC-2030 (Shimadzu GC-2030, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a capillary column FAMEwax 30 m (RESTEK, Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, USA), using helium as carrier gas. The PTV injector temperature was 260 °C, that of the FID detector 250 °C. A temperature program was used for analysis. The Labsolutions software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used for elaboration of the chromatogram. FAs were identified using the retention times of reference standards and expressed as % of total FAs.  Dietary data  Out of 155 subjects admitted to the pediatric urology unit, dietary data was available for 60 (Fig. 1). A 24-h dietary recall was completed by the subjects or their parents/guardians in an interview that lasted about 30 min.",e0785d1c-b00b-49ec-ac2e-c9eca9fe4fc9

10,discussion0," The present work was performed in a single centre and it describes the FA composition in spotted whole blood in a cohort of young people, their adherence to the MedDiet as evaluated in the KIDMED test, and the correlation between the KIDMED score and various FAs and FA indices.  The majority of the subjects were of male sex. All age groups showed lower BMI and z-BMI values. In fact, the cohort was characterized by being less afflicted by overweight and obesity (10%) than the national (29.7%) or regional (22.3%) average in 8-year-olds [22].  As to the FA pattern, some n6-polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) increased from age group < 2 years to the age groups ≥2 years (Dihomo gamma linolenic acid (DGLA), AA, total n6-polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA)) while LA was stable. There was a trend of an increase in AA levels between school age children and teenagers.",e874161d-a922-4e6f-968b-10c396f2ebd0
11,discussion1," The n3-polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) Alpha linolenic acid (ALA) and total n3-polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) decreased, while eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were stable. Total polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) was also stable. Among saturated FAs, SA increased while PA and total SFA were invariant.  The FA profile in several blood compartments has been studied for decades as marker for dietary fat intake [23]. Besides dietary intake of fat, further factors may influence the FA profile of tissues such as repletion of vitamins and trace elements which was shown to improve children’s circulating LCpolyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) status [24, 25]. Also exposure to environmental pollutants may affect FA composition: urinary phthalates correlated with circulating FAs in the general adult US population, and various phthalates correlated with distinct FAs [26].",f887f1ea-c66e-47b4-a325-9f577cece82b
12,discussion2," A recent report on global Bisphenol A intake showed that Italian children had the lowest daily exposure dose among children from 18 regions/countries [27], although children living in Milan were shown to be exposed to environmental equivalent black carbon which depended on season and further variables [28]. The genetic make-up also seems to be a major factor in determining FA levels as well, depending on FADS variants [29–31]. Globally, the levels revealed here should reflect the impact of all variables that influence blood fatty acids.  To evaluate compliance to the MedDiet, a modified version of the KIDMED protocol was used. The questions on pulses and nuts were not detected in the 24-h recall and these queries were omitted. The consumption of fish and meat was traced and the questions about these foods were transformed into consumption thereof on the day before the interview, and the item ‘fast food’ was rephrased to ‘transformed/red meat’.",c6c1231c-ab91-4cfe-b304-7d03f920b644
13,discussion3," Also, the topic of the daily distribution of meals is addressed in the Italian guidelines in relation to healthy eating [32] and a question in that regard was introduced in the questionnaire. The changes might have made the survey less stringent, but several questionnaires of KIDMED exist [21] and adapted protocols are used [33–35]. Generally, the cohort showed scarce compliance to the MedDiet: about 10% showed a high level. In the age group 2- < 10 yrs., the MedDiet score correlated significantly with some of the FA parameters and ratios. The score correlated negatively with total polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA), total n6-polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA), AA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), AA/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and n6/n3; positively with total MUFA and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) balance.",f7c4cf82-b44e-4fcf-a8de-91481dd6daef
14,discussion4," The negative effect of the score on blood n6-FA parameters and the related neutral/positive effect on n3-polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) resulted in a changed equilibrium in blood polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) which was reflected in the polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) balance. Age influenced correlations but not those regarding polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) balance and AA/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ratio. There was a strong trend for a negative correlation between the score and LA. There was also a trend for a positive correlation between score and oleic acid. Oleic acid is an important component of olive oil which is maybe the cardinal marker of the MedDiet [36]. Unfortunately, the cohort number with dietary data was small which plausibly may explain the non-significant correlation between score and oleic acid, LA, and some other FAs.",82786092-4e41-4d89-a034-89db8646f0b8
15,discussion5,"  Comparisons with other studies and what the current work adds to the existing knowledge  Regarding FAs in western children without apparent disease, early and recent studies analysed the FA composition in plasma [37, 38], red blood cells (red blood cells (RBC)) [39], and whole blood, as mentioned [13–15]. The FA profile observed in the present study corroborates partly previous findings in young Italian individuals without apparent disease [13]. In that study, the pattern of changes in the FA composition from neonatal age to childhood showed an increase in some FAs (LA, Alpha linolenic acid (ALA), polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA), and omega-6), a decrease in others (AA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), SFA, MUFA, omega-3), or unaltered levels (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) [13].",2f43e791-72b4-48dd-a1a1-8caf5004596e
16,discussion6," The findings noted here regarding total polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA), n6-polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA), MUFA, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) corroborate those earlier observations whereas those on LA, Alpha linolenic acid (ALA), AA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and SFA do not. It may be noted that the infants in the former study were 4 days old neonates whereas here, the youngest child was 46 days. The different ages of the youngest children in the two studies complicate comparisons and may explain differences between the results. The group with older children showed a higher mean BMI than the subjects studied here [13]. It is known that the FA metabolism changes in obesity: the desaturating enzyme activity of FADS2 appeared to increase while that of FADS1 appeared to be inhibited with the result of lower LCpolyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) levels [5].",b6d4277e-d3b4-44e9-a82a-7e26a0ea4b6b
17,discussion7," This could explain discrepancies in the results, for instance, in the present study, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and AA levels were higher than in the report by Risé et al. [13]. Despite this, the estimated FADS activities detected here overlapped with those seen in other surveys [14, 15]. The “Identification and prevention of dietary-and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants” (in children and infants” (IDEFICS)) project, which aims also included the search for biomarkers of the aetiology of overweight, obesity, and related disorders [40], is the largest survey performed so far on spotted whole blood FA profile in children. in children and infants” (IDEFICS) presented FA reference intervals from European children 3–9 years [14]. In that survey, a few FAs were weakly age-dependent (LA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), DPAn3 in the girls), some were stable throughout the age range (Alpha linolenic acid (ALA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), AA).",69615ca3-5066-422e-a379-21f3f9cfce87
18,discussion8," Several investigations described FAs in spotted whole blood from children in developing countries [41–43], some of which showed high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [42, 43].  As mentioned earlier, the FA profile in several blood compartments has been studied as a marker for dietary fat intake [23]. A few studies evaluated the dietary intake and its relation to whole blood FAs in adults [19, 44, 45] and in Danish children [46, 47]. The low compliance to the MedDiet in the present research is in accordance with observations in several countries in southern Europe [17] and Israel [35] and support earlier data from the ZOOM8 study on 8–9 year old children in Italy [33]. Similarly to what could be observed here, a lack of nut consumption was seen by the children in the Calabrian Sierras Community study (Calabrian Sierras Community study (CSCS)) in Southern Italy [34].",f686465d-b016-4428-8786-df2010cfcbde
19,discussion9," In contrast to the present results though, most of the children in the Calabrian Sierras Community study (CSCS) study showed high-intermediate adherence to the MedDiet. As far as we are aware, the current study is the first to estimate correlations between the KIDMED test score and the FA profile in whole blood in children. Recently, the KIDMED index was used in the evaluation of FAs in red cell membranes in a study on childhood obesity [48]. In that report, the cohort comprised a higher number of participants than in the present one and weak but significant correlations were revealed between the KIDMED score and AA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [48]. Whole blood consists of plasma and cells, mostly red blood cells (RBC) [23], and the content of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) correlated strongly with that of whole blood [49].",b9caaf0f-cf81-4f96-972e-33d30a60cc80
20,discussion10," The directions of the correlations detected here in whole blood agreed with those seen in red blood cells (RBC) membranes [48]. Lack of significant correlations was noticed for some polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA), which may be due to the small number of participants already discussed. Various health outcomes in children could be related to whole blood FAs [15, 46, 47] and the current study shows the possibility of using whole blood FAs and the MedDiet score in the study of childhood health issues.  Strengths and limitations of the study  A strength of this study regards the relatively large cohort of paediatric subjects from a single centre that permitted relatively homogeneous data. Another strength concerns the choice of whole blood for FA measurements that showed its relevance in studying FA and MedDiet relationships. The study has some limitations though, first of all, dietary data was not available from all participants.",9c375f49-fbc7-45ea-944d-9f2f1a4205cb
21,discussion11," This probably allowed only the strongest correlations between KIDMED score and FA parameters to reach significance. Further, the use of a modified KIDMED questionnaire may have reduced accuracy, even if it is well known and accepted that a number of adaptations are applied.  Conclusions  In summary, this single-centre survey reports whole blood FAs and indices in infants, children, and adolescents which add information and knowledge to the existent literature about FA composition in young subjects. Increased FA proportions with age were seen in the n6-series of polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA). The n3- polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) species decreased or were stable. The vast majority of the subjects with dietary data, 92%, obtained a KIDMED score indicative of low-medium adherence to the MedDiet. In children 2- < 10 years of age, the score correlated positively with polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) balance and negatively with various n6-polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) species.",fc42e2d1-7262-4f7e-81f3-005fc3878a6d
22,discussion12, This combination indicates that the MedDiet dampens circulating n6-polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA). The results show the relevance of using whole blood to study presumed relationships between MedDiet and FAs and could be used in the clinic in studies of childhood health problems.
