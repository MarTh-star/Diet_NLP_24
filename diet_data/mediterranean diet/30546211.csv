0,introduction0,"Cardiometabolic diseases and obesity are the leading causes of death in developed countries, becoming an epidemic in the last years1,2. Unhealthy diets represent one of the top risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and obesity, developing a positive energy balance3. Simultaneously, a low basal metabolic rate (basal metabolic rate (BMR)), an impaired meal-induced thermogenesis and low physical activity levels could result in a reduced total energy expenditure4. This low total energy expenditure coupled to high energy intake could produce a gradual weight gain and visceral adipose tissue deposition, increasing the risk of cardiometabolic diseases and obesity5.  The ability to oxidize fat as a fuel is considered an important metabolic health parameter6. An impaired ability to oxidize fat is associated with an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, cancer and systemic inflammation7.",25d62d1f-d936-42b3-b12c-60aaeeae4fb6
1,introduction1," Therefore, fat oxidation in basal conditions (BFox) and maximal fat oxidation during exercise (maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO)) are considered markers of metabolic health8–10.  Sleep pattern variations, including a decrease in the quality and quantity of sleep, have been shown to be also a risk factor for the development of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases11. These changes in sleep quality and quantity disrupt the circadian rhythms and may have deleterious consequences on people health12. Previous studies have provided a causal link between short sleep duration and poor sleep quality with pathological metabolic consequences due to the disruption in the circadian rhythms and increasing levels of adiposity11,13. Metabolic regulation is not an output function of the circadian system12. However, nutrient, energy and redox levels signal back to cellular clocks to reinforce circadian rhythms and to adapt physiology (i.e.",1959eca5-e50c-4b61-a021-de82776993a9
2,introduction2," hormones, body temperature, nervous system) to temporal tissue-specific requirements11,13. In this sense, previous studies have demonstrated that poor sleep quality and quantity may decrease basal metabolic rate (BMR) and BFox14, and sleep deprivation may not affect maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO) in young adults15. However, there are no studies testing the associations between sleep quality and time (both subjective and objective) with basal metabolic rate (BMR) and fuel oxidation in basal conditions and during exercise.  One of the possible causes of the relationship between sleep parameters with basal metabolic rate (BMR) and fuel oxidation could be the dietary modifications. In this sense, unhealthy sleep patterns could increase food consumption and consequently energy intake through several previously-explained potential mechanisms16. Previous studies have shown that dietary intake could influence BFox and maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO)8,17,18.",f2cf4faf-0c32-4e88-a0c3-2c16b7852be8
3,introduction3," Concretely, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate intake could increase BFox and maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO)6,19. As well as, the lack of sleep can increase the consumption of high fat energy-dense foods16, which theoretically may modify BFox and maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO). However, there is a lack of evidence investigating the mediating role of dietary intake in the relationship of sleep outcomes with energy metabolism parameters.  Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship of subjective and objective sleep quality and time with basal metabolic rate (BMR) and fuel oxidation in basal conditions and during exercise in sedentary middle-aged adults. We also aimed to study the mediation role of dietary intake and adherence to the traditional Mediterranean Diet between sleep parameters and energy metabolism parameters in sedentary middle-aged adults. The present study undertakes a secondary analysis of the FIT-AGEING study.  ",4801d0a5-5bb6-4b96-aeb3-3765eadcc81b

Anthropometric and body composition measurements Anthropometric variables were measured by a certified anthropometrist [the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK)] following the ISAK guidelines21. Both body weight and height were assessed using an electronic scale and stadiometer (Seca model 799, Hamburg, Germany), and the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as (weight [kg]/ height2 [m]).

7,methods3,"  Sleep quality and time assessment The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) is a self-report tool which consists of 19-item scale that provides 7 component scores (ranges 0–3): (i) subjective sleep quality (very good to very bad), (ii) sleep latency (≤15 minutes to >60 minutes), (iii) sleep duration (≥7 hours to <5 hours), (iv) sleep efficiency (≥85% to <65% hours sleep/hours in bed), (v) sleep disturbances (not during the past month to ≥ 3 times per week), (vi) use of sleeping medications (none to ≥ 3 times a week), and (vii) daytime dysfunction (not a problem to a very big problem), with a total global score ranging from 0 to 2122. A Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score higher than 5 indicates poor sleep quality22.

8,methods4," Participants received detailed information on how to wear the accelerometer and were asked to remove it only for water activities. It was also recorded the times in which the participants went to bed every night, woke up every morning and removed the device every day. The accelerometers used an epoch length of 5 seconds and a frequency rate of 100 Hz to store raw accelerations23. The raw accelerations were exported in “.csv” format using ActiLife v. 6.13.3 software (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, US) and processed using the GGIR package (v. 1.6–0, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/index.html)24 in R (v. 3.1.2, https://www.cran.r-project.org/). We derived the Euclidean Norm Minus One G (Euclidean Norm Minus One G (ENMO)) as √(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) −1G (where 1 G ~ 9.8 m/s2) with the accelerometer’s z angle to describe sleep patterns.

9,methods5," According to this algorithm, sleep was defined as any period of sustained inactivity, in which there were minimal changes in the arm angle (i.e., as much 5 degrees for 5 minutes periods) during a period recorded as sleep by the participant in their diary reports25. The following variables were analyzed: total sleep time (minutes slept between bedtime and wake time), sleep efficiency (percentage of time asleep while in bed) and wake after sleep onset (minutes awake between sleep onset and wake time). It is to note that only the participants wearing the accelerometers for ≥16 hours/day for at least 4 days (including at least 1 weekend day) were included in the final analyses (i.e. a total of 4 participants did not meet these conditions)23. The mean accelerometer wear-time for the 70 participants included in the final analyses were 6.7 days (4.3% of non-wear time).",78fce4a6-ba02-46f9-9f7c-001f1293e927

The evening meal consumed by the subjects prior to fasting was previously standardized: an egg omelet with fried tomato and boiled rice.  basal metabolic rate (BMR) and fuel oxidation in basal conditions were measured through indirect calorimetry (IC) following the current scientific consensus27. All tests were conducted in the same quiet room with controlled room temperature (i.e. 22–24 °C) and humidity (i.e. 35–45%). IC measurements were performed during 30-minute periods with a CPX Ultima CardiO2 system (Medical Graphics Corp, St Paul, MN, USA) employing a neoprene face-mask with no external ventilation27.",ada307c6-7d96-4ef6-b590-b7cbef331669

The Frayn’s equation was used to estimate BFox and basal carbohydrate oxidation (BCHox) expressed in g/min34. The BFox and BCHox were also expressed as a percentage of the basal metabolic rate (BMR).  Maximal fat oxidation during exercise assessment maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO) and the intensity that elicit maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO) (FATmax) were assessed in a different day of the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and BFox/BCHox test (i.e. interval 3 to 15 days).",b814ef7b-e7cb-40c7-a440-c8c40ee75c84

A walking graded test on a treadmill (H/P/cosmos pulsar, H/P/cosmos sports & medical GmbH, Nussdorf-Traunstein, Germany) was performed to calculate maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO) and FATmax following a previously validated methodology35. Briefly, the protocol started assessing the maximal walking speed of each participant35–37. After ~3 minutes resting, the walking graded test started with a 3-minute warm up at 3.5 km/h. Subsequently, the treadmill speed was increased 1 km/h every 3 minutes until the maximal walking speed was reached.

14,methods10," An automated gas analysis system (CPX Ultima CardiO2; Medical Graphics Corp, St Paul, MN) was used to record breath-by-breath gas exchange measurements. Participants wore an oronasal mask (model 7400, Hans Rudolph Inc, Kansas City, MO, USA) equipped with a prevent™ metabolic flow sensor (Medgraphics Corp, Minnesota, USA). Gas analysis systems were calibrated following the manufacturer’s recommendations. VO2 and VCO2 were averaged over and the last 60 seconds of each graded exercise protocol stage. Frayn’s equation was used to estimate fat oxidation rates34. These fat oxidation values were plotted against the relative-exercise intensity, expressed as the percentage of maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max); a third-degree polynomial curve was built to determine maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO) and FATmax38. maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO) was also expressed as maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO)LM in order to relativize it to the lean mass.",85b9ca61-35ec-4af3-bd5f-1769e8500bee

Indeed, our recent systematic review has analyzed a total of 112 studies which included data about fuel oxidation during exercise37. None of those studies reported maximal carbohydrate oxidation during exercise.  Cardiorespiratory fitness assessment VO2max was determined using a maximum treadmill (H/P/Cosmos Pulsar treadmill, H/P/Cosmos Sport & Medical GMBH, Germany) exercise test following the modified Balke protocol, which has been extensively validated40. In short, the warm up consisted in walking at 3 km/h for 1 minute followed by 2 minutes at 4 km/h.

16,methods12," We used the same indirect calorimetry and software as in the maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO) assessment.  Dietary intake assessment Diet was assessed using three 24-hour recalls carried out on 3 separate days (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) by a qualified and trained research dietitian. Dietary recalls were done on different days than the maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO) and VO2 assessments.  In the face-to-face interviews, the participants were asked to recall all food consumed during the previous day. The interviews involved a detailed assessment and description of the food consumption using colored photographs of different-size portions of food to improve the participants’ accuracy of food quantification41.

Energy and weight data of daily food and beverages were obtained from the 24-hours recalls.  The traditional Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower prevalence of chronic diseases (i.e. obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, cancer) and mortality43.

28,discussion0,"The main finding of the present study is that a poor subjective sleep quality was associated with lower BFox independently of sex, age and body composition outcomes. No consistent association was observed between any sleep quality and time parameters with basal metabolic rate (BMR), maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO) and FATmax. Moreover, our results indicated that the association of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score with BFox was not mediated by dietary intake and MedDiet adherence.  We observed an inverse association between total sleep time and basal metabolic rate (BMR) which disappeared after controlling for confounders. The energy expenditure is lowest during sleep, therefore a high total sleep time is related with a prolonged period of the lowest energy expenditure48. Sleep deprivation could increase energy expenditure since energy expenditure is reduced during sleep48. Sharma et al.",1b7b54cf-cd6d-4640-b9d9-df28ff75213e
29,discussion1," proposed that these reduction in energy expenditure could be influenced by circadian rhythm, body temperature and muscle temperature48. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because this association disappeared after controlling for sex, age and fat mass index (FMI). Several physiological mechanisms could explain the relationship between sleep quality and BFox. Sleep restriction is associated with insulin resistance characterized by a decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake49, which could develop metabolic inflexibility characterized by an impaired BFox50. Short sleep duration and sleep fragmentation arealso related to low leptin levels or leptin resistance51 which are associated with an impaired fatty acid oxidation52. Sleep disruption (discontinuity of sleep) can lead to the disruption of circadian rhythms13, which orchestrate crucial physiological and behavioral functions, being one of these the regulation of carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism12.",6c1557b2-397e-4abb-ad18-af62b3d8994b
30,discussion2," Higher sleep duration and quality are associated with a healthier gut microbiome53, which could suppress insulin signaling, increase β-oxidation and inhibit fat oxidation derived from the production of short-chain fatty acids54. Furthermore, sleep disruption (discontinuity of sleep) could decrease melatonin production13, which has important metabolic functions, such as lipolysis, regulating the energy flow55. An increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species is observed in impaired sleep patterns13. Both inflammation and oxidative stress could modulate metabolic flexibility, specifically fat oxidation56,57. Therefore, based on the above-mentioned mechanisms, a healthy sleep pattern could improve metabolic health via the increment of BFox and viceversa.",f4138d7e-1519-42e9-a1d7-280685f1981f
31,discussion3,"  In addition, an impaired sleep pattern, determined by a low sleep duration could increase energy intake through several potential mechanisms: increment of time and opportunities for eating, psychological distress, sensitivity to food reward, energy needed to sustain wakefulness, hunger hormones and decrease dietary restraint16. A lack of sleep or low sleep quality could increase the intake of high energy-dense foods, high fat and sugary snacks, which are low in fiber16. In this sense, although we did not find any association between energy and macronutrient intake, we observed that fiber intake was negatively associated with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score. Fiber intake could have different metabolic effects (i.e. insulin sensitivity and glycemia improvement)58, that could have a potential role in the regulation of fat oxidation. However, we did not find any mediating role of dietary intake (i.e.",7bf70c1a-ba90-464b-ae31-5322cc91e8fb
32,discussion4," fiber intake) between the association of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) with BFox. The lack of a mediating role may be due to specific issues: (i) since dietary outcomes were assessed in a specific time point, it could be that the dietary intake was insufficiently maintained over time to modify BFox; (ii) the possible lower and upper threshold for when dietary intake (i.e. fat intake) could modify fat oxidation59; (iii) the inter-individual variability, body composition and metabolic status influence on fat oxidation8; (iv) a sleep patterns insufficiently maintained over time.  The lack of association between any sleep outcomes with basal metabolic rate (BMR) and maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO) could be explained by different factors. Sleep is a complex phenomenon influenced by behavioral and physiological mechanisms (i.e. homeostatic, circadian and metabolic control) under the participant’s natural sleep environment that we have not investigated60.",3b8a9b01-da01-4a29-9b9a-5db15a47dbc0
33,discussion5," These factors could influence the relationship between sleep parameters and basal metabolic rate (BMR) and maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO).  We also observed an inverse association between total sleep time with maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO). A previous study of Konishi et al. observed that a night of sleep deprivation did not affect maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO) in healthy young men15. It has been reported several detrimental effects of long sleep for optimal health61. In addition, long sleep could increase fatigue, physiological deprivation, which could influence insulin resistance and hormonal imbalance62. Although the mechanisms are not clear, the above-mentioned mechanisms could have influenced this relationship. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because this association disappeared after controlling for sex, age and fat mass index (FMI).",d25cd7fc-4667-4935-96da-67800b7e3877

It has been previously reported that Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and accelerometer records measure different attributes of sleep, highlighting the bias of accelerometry to register wakefulness, thus lying in bed awake but motionless is likely to be coded as sleep63. Therefore, it is recommended to use both methods to obtain complementary information additionally to the body movements64. These differences in measurement of sleep attributes could explain the different results of the associations between sleep quality and energy metabolism.",8db2ab28-3264-4cdd-9d65-ca5cd88f6bad
35,discussion7,"  Despite accelerometer records and subjective measurements are a valid and extensively used measure of sleep quality26,65 they cannot differentiate between rapid eye movement sleep (rapid eye movement sleep (REM)) and non-rapid eye movement sleep (Nrapid eye movement sleep (REM)), restricting the detailed assessment of the real biologic process of sleep. rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and Nrapid eye movement sleep (REM) phases are metabolically different66. In rapid eye movement sleep (REM) sleep glucose uptake is increased, leading to anaerobic glucose metabolism67,68, therefore sleep quality in each phase could be differently associated with energy metabolism. Future studies that examine the relationship between rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and Nrapid eye movement sleep (REM) sleep using polysomnography records with basal metabolic rate (BMR) and fuel oxidation in basal conditions and during exercise are needed.",c60f52c2-1afc-45c9-9555-cc28f3c603e3
36,discussion8,"  The present study should be interpreted with caution; the study has a cross-sectional design that does not allow to establish causal relationship. Therefore, experimental studies should manipulate basal metabolic rate (BMR) and fuel oxidation and/or sleep (e.g. sleep deprivation) under well-controlled lab conditions in order to establish causal relationship. Furthermore, sleep and dietary parameters were assessed only in a specific timepoint, which do not allow us to extrapolate our results to chronic sleep or dietary patterns. Our study only included middle-aged sedentary adults and, consequently, we cannot extrapolate our results to older, younger, and/or physically active individuals. The difficulty of an accurate dietary evaluation with possible underreporting or misclassification should be considered, as in all cross-sectional studies. Lastly, the narrow Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score range should be taken into account when interpreting our results.",4c985df6-2be7-40da-8464-84e816efaf73
37,discussion9,"  Conclusions In conclusion, our study showed that a subjective poor sleep quality was associated with lower BFox. No association was found between the remaining sleep parameters with basal metabolic rate (BMR) and fuel oxidation in basal conditions and during exercise. Moreover, our findings indicated that the association of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score with BFox was not mediated by dietary intake and MedDiet adherence. Further studies are needed to better understand the physiological mechanisms of sleep regulation and how it could influence the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and fuel oxidation in basal conditions and during exercise.
