HT Reduces the Accumulation of MDSCs in Tumor-Bearing Mice  At present, there is no report on the regulation of tumor immunity by HT. MDSCs are the main immunosuppressive cells, which have been extensively studied and demonstrated to not only promote tumor progression, but also impair the anti-tumor immune responses elicited by therapeutic agents .",0a8432f0-8678-45f1-b1a3-f71d23977d75

In addition, we analyzed the expression of Gr-1 in mouse pancreatic tumors through IHC, and found that the expression of Gr-1 in tumors from the HT treatment group was significantly reduced (Figures 3G,H). In order to further clarify the effects of HT on different subsets of MDSCs, we analyzed the proportion of PMN-MDSCs and M-MDSCs in the spleens.

We found that 50 and 100 μM HT can inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in BM-derived MDSCs (Figures 4D,E). At the same time, HT inhibited the transcription of ARG1 and TGF-β in BM-derived MDSCs, and further inhibited the protein expression of ARG1 (Figures 4G–J).  The phenotype and activity of BM-derived MDSCs depends on transcription factor C/EBPβ. IL-6-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 also sustains survival and accumulation of MDSCs. Our results showed that HT can inhibit the transcription of C/EBPβ, and inhibit the protein expression of C/EBPβ (Figures 4F,I,J).",58508609-d08f-4654-977e-07f4b4954680

HT Promotes the Proportion of M1 Macrophages but not T Cells  The main inhibitory target of MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is T lymphocytes. Our data revealed that HT can inhibit the accumulation of MDSCs and the expression of related immunosuppressive molecules in tumor-bearing mice. Therefore, we further analyzed the effect of HT treatment on the proportion of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells.

CD47 blocking can increase the efficiency of cancer cells clearance by macrophages. Therefore, we further evaluated the effects of HT combined with anti-CD47 antibody on mouse pancreatic cancer progression. We found that HT enhanced the anti-tumor effect of anti-CD47 antibody (Figures 6A–C).

These suggest that reducing the proportion of MDSCs or eliminating the function of MDSCs is beneficial to the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

30,discussion3," Our results showed that HT can inhibit the proliferation of Panc 02 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (0–200 µM), and promote Panc 02 cells death at high concentration (200 µM). Mechanistically, we found that HT can inhibit Panc 02 cells proliferation by inhibiting p-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3/Cyclin D1 instead of inhibiting p-AKT/p-NFκb signaling pathway. Furthermore, HT can inhibit the growth of orthotopic pancreatic tumors in mice and reduce the expression of Ki67 in tumors. HT showed good therapeutic effects in vivo and in vitro.  Previous study has found that HT can inhibit the expression of inflammatory factors such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, and attenuate infiltration of activated immune cells in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated sepsis in mice (Alblihed, 2021). HT can also inhibit mast cell degranulation induced by both immune and non-immune pathways .",23678276-60b3-4752-9dc5-f73382be446a
31,discussion4," These studies suggest that HT may have ability to regulate immunity, but whether it has a regulatory effect on the tumor immune microenvironment has not been reported. Therefore, we further explored the impact of HT on the immune microenvironment of mouse orthotopic pancreatic tumor. The results showed that HT can inhibit the accumulation of MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice. In addition, HT can promote the proportion of M1 macrophages in the tumors, spleens and BM. We used BM-derived MDSCs to deeply explore the effect of HT on the differentiation of MDSCs and the expression of related immunosuppressive molecules. The results showed that HT can inhibit the differentiation of MDSCs, inhibit the expression of immune molecules (ARG1, TGF-β, reactive oxygen species (ROS)), and inhibit the expression of key transcription factors (C/EBPβ and p-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3) for the differentiation and function of MDSCs.",c1d5c68e-ff7c-4af0-a5a0-f793b16c2b5b
32,discussion5," This indicates that the treatment of HT in mouse pancreatic cancer is multi-approach. On the one hand, it has a direct inhibitory effect on tumor cells, and on the other hand, it has a regulatory effect on myeloid cells in tumor-bearing mice. In addition, based on the ability of HT to promote M1 macrophages, we further evaluated the anti-tumor effect of HT in combination with anti-CD47 antibody. The results indicated that HT can enhance the anti-tumor effect of anti-CD47 antibody. However, in this study, anti-CD47 antibody treatment alone did not achieve significant efficacy, and there was no difference between the antibody combined HT group and HT treatment group. The mechanism still needs further explanation.  plumbagin (PLB) is a broad-spectrum anti-tumor drug that has been extensively studied. In this study, we used HT combined with plumbagin (PLB) in order to obtain a better treatment effect.",bb3ee8bf-6ca4-49b2-8078-39ee941c6311
33,discussion6," Although this combination therapy did not produce statistical differences with any of the single treatment in tumor weight. But surprisingly, this combination therapy reshaped the immune microenvironment of tumor-bearing mice, including inhibiting the accumulation of MDSCs, promoting the proportion of M1 macrophages, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells. This combination should be further combined with other chemotherapeutic drugs and immune checkpoint antagonists, which is expected to have a new breakthrough in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.  Conclusion  In summary, HT can inhibit mouse pancreatic cancer in vivo and in vitro. And our study demonstrated for the first time that HT inhibits the differentiation of MDSCs, the expression of ARG1, TGF-β and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MDSCs by down-regulating the expression of C/EBPβ and p-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3.",4f0b86f8-1595-4280-877b-1013460d0c4f
34,discussion7," Moreover, HT can promote the proportion of M1 macrophages and enhance the anti-tumor effect of anti-CD47 antibody. We also innovatively proposed that HT combined with plumbagin (PLB) can improve the immunosuppressive microenvironment of mouse pancreatic cancer, and it is expected to become potential drugs for immunotherapy. But there are still several limitations in the current study: First, the proportion of MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice decreased while the proportion of M1 macrophages increased after HT treatment. However, the source of M1 macrophages remains to be clarified. There is no direct evidence that MDSCs were polarized to M1 macrophages by HT. Second, although HT alone treatment obviously inhibited MDSCs, the proportion of T cells in tumor-bearing mice did not increase. This suggests that there may be other immunosuppressive factors that need to be further explored.",eea614bd-3a23-4133-be95-a1ae138a1cc9
