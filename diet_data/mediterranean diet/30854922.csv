0,introduction0,"Cardiovascular (CV) diseases represent the leading cause of death worldwide. Every year more than 17 million people die from this cause, which represents more than 30% of the total deaths registered( 1 ). In Spain, these diseases rank third in terms of potential years of life lost, only behind tumors and external causes( 2 ). From the epidemiological point of view, it is estimated that the action of factors traditionally linked to them may lead to a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality( 3 4 ). In particular, it is considered that diet may be the behavioral factor with the greatest impact in minimizing CV risk( 5 ). Among the dietary patterns that reduce CV morbidity and mortality, the Mediterranean diet (MedDi) has been pointed out. This diet is based on a generous intake of fruits, vegetables, complex carbohydrates or mono-unsaturated fats and, on the contrary, a low intake of animal fats and sugars.",d7cb86f7-ed01-496c-8633-1f804b72f710
1,introduction1," Its preventive mechanism would be supported by its positive influence on blood pressure, body weight, glycemic control, vascular inflammation or arteriosclerosis, among others( 6 ).  Several studies have analyzed the prevalence of CV risk factors in the Spanish population( 7 9 ). However, these investigations have been carried out on the general population, with little literature on the prevalence of these factors in more specific populations such as workers. Similarly, there are still gaps in the literature regarding the association between MedDi follow-up and the prevalence of CV risk factors motivated by the great heterogeneity of the studies and their poor methodological quality( 10 ). Based on these deficiencies, the objectives of this investigation were to determine the prevalence of CV risk factors in a cohort of workers from Aragon (Spain) and to quantify its association with the MedDi follow-up.  Method A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out.",4ba46c60-6001-49de-991a-c50110a41ab2
2,introduction2," Prior to the start of the investigation, the authorization of the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research in Aragon was requested. At all times, the confidentiality of the data established by the current Organic Law on Data Protection was respected. In addition, all the participants signed an informed consent after being informed of the objectives and methodology of the study.  The study population was that of workers in the Aragon region with health surveillance arranged with MAS-Prevención, a company for preventing occupational risks with major presence throughout Spain. The participants were recruited consecutively in the company medical exams sessions implemented by MAS-Prevención during the first half of 2018.",f3b72e48-136a-4558-bac7-7f23d5db73e2
3,introduction3,"  The workers who agreed to participate in the survey were 25,613; 763 were excluded from the analysis after showing a fast of less than 10 hours, 459 due to problems derived from the management of blood samples and 662 due to omissions or possible errors in data transcription. Thus, the final sample size was 23,729.  The participants were asked for information regarding their age, relationship with tobacco and alcohol, physical activity (PA) and adherence to the MedDi. Subsequently, according to the standardized protocol of medical examination of MAS-Prevención, trained health personnel examined the participants (blood pressure, weight, height and abdominal circumference) and performed a blood draw.  Alcohol consumption (in grams - gr) was calculated based on the following formula: Grams=graduationXvolumeclX0.8/100. From this calculation, a daily intake > 30 g in men and > 20 g in women( 11 ) was considered as risky alcohol consumption.",8600a768-a04a-4733-9359-fb87bade1c1d
4,introduction4,"  All the participants who did not comply with any of the activity recommendations described by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) for people aged 18 to 64 years old were considered inactive/sedentary( 12 ).  The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS-14) was used to assess the degree of adherence to the MedDi. This is a specific questionnaire of fourteen items validated in the general population( 13 ). To obtain your score, the value +1 is assigned to each item with a positive connotation with respect to the MedDi. The degree of adherence is determined from the sum of the obtained values, establishing two levels: Acceptable MedDi adherence (score ≥9), and low adherence (<9).  Blood pressure was assessed with the patient in the supine position and the arm at the level of the heart; three measurements were made with 1-minute intervals between them. The reported blood pressure was the mean of the three determinations.",7a0a5171-2570-4464-86d8-c92b93ee7046
5,introduction5," Arterial hypertension (Arterial hypertension (AHT)) was considered in view of systolic blood pressure values ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg.  The height of the participants was determined, without footwear, using an approved portable stadiometer (model SECA 213©). The participants were weighed in light underwear using an approved electronic scale (Detecto PD200©). The measurement of the abdominal perimeter (in centimeters - cm) was carried out, with the participant in a standing position, using a tape measure placed parallel to the ground and covering the contour between the upper part of the iliac crests and the lower rib. A risky abdominal perimeter (central/abdominal obesity) was considered when the measurements were ≥88 cm in women and ≥102 cm in men( 14 ).  For the blood test, the participant must have respected a night fast of, at least, 10 hours. The samples were sent to the entity’s laboratory (accredited by the National Accreditation Entity).",0fe6d0f9-e067-4082-8cd0-b32bf757aa5f
6,introduction6," All the participants with baseline blood glucose ≥126 mg/dl (or under anti-diabetic treatment) were classified as diabetic, and those who reported being under pharmacological treatment for lipid alterations or met any of the diagnostic criteria of the Spanish Society of Arteriosclerosis were considered as dyslipidemic( 15 ). Finally and based on international consensus criteria( 16 ), the existence of metabolic syndrome was evaluated.  The descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the sample was carried out using the mean and standard deviation for the quantitative variables and the number and percentage for the qualitative ones. The comparison by sex of these characteristics was performed using the Student’s t-test on the quantitative variables and the Chi-square for the qualitative ones. The analysis of the relationship between compliance with the MedDi and the presence of CV risk factors was performed using different binary logistic regression models (forward Wald method).",ae9ff56a-16d8-4c78-a34a-2b58d622726f
7,introduction7," The results of these models are presented through the Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals with adjustment for age, sex and other factors potentially associated with the development of diabetes, dyslipidemia, Arterial hypertension (AHT), obesity and/or metabolic syndrome indicated by the previous bibliography( 17 20 ). All the calculations were performed with the SPSS Version 21.0 software, accepting the significance level of α≤0.05. ",3a5c5c0b-e5de-4547-88c7-6a2a1fec6ecd
8,results0," 51.3% of the participants showed good adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The multivariate analysis showed an inverse and significant association between the follow-up of the Mediterranean diet and the prevalence of abdominal obesity (Odds Ratio = 0.64, 95% CI 0.56; 0.73), dyslipidemia (Odds Ratio = 0.55, 95% CI 0.42; 0.73), and metabolic syndrome (Odds Ratio = 0.76, 95% CI 0.67; 0.86).  Conclusions: our results suggest that the Mediterranean diet is potentially effective in promoting cardiovascular health. Implementing the interventions promoting the Mediterranean diet in the working population seems justified.

12,results7," The components of the scale with the highest degree of compliance were the preferred use of olive oil, the preferred consumption of white over red meat and the consumption of 2 or more servings of vegetables per day. In contrast, the lowest levels of compliance were those related to the consumption of red wine, legumes, nuts, commercial pastries and fish. In the sex analysis, women showed higher consumptions of olive oil, fish and commercial pastries. Men consumed more nuts, wine, sugary/carbonated drinks and animal fats (margarine, butter, cream, etc.) (Table 2).

14,discussion0,"The results of this research show a working population with a high prevalence of CV risk factors. However, the figures obtained are below the bulk of those reported in other Spanish population-based studies( 2 , 7 9 , 17 ). This difference may be related to the location of the different studies. The sample of this study lies in the northeast of Spain, far from the southern area of the country where higher prevalences of CV risk factors have traditionally been reported and, in general, a worse socioeconomic situation( 21 ). In any case, this comparison and its interpretation should be taken with caution, due to the differences in the baseline characteristics of the participants of the various studies (especially age groups) and in the diagnostic criteria of certain CV risk factors (dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome). The literature on the prevalence of CV risk factors in Spanish workers is very scarce. A study was found, started in 2009 but still under follow-up, where 80.3%, 47.",e3f154b5-cb81-4cd5-8ff2-99f851d543c4
15,discussion1,"1%, 40.0% and 7.4% prevalences of overweight/obesity, hypertension, smoking and diabetes were reported, respectively( 22 ).  As for our participants, 51.3% reported acceptable adherence to the MedDi. At this point, the results of previous studies are very heterogeneous, with adherence ranges between 14% and 58.3%( 23 28 ). The relatively privileged situation of this sample compared to that of previous studies could be due to the intense Worker Health Promotion strategy implemented by MAS-Prevención in the last 5 years. This strategy, fundamentally implemented by the institution’s work nurses, is based on a powerful educational commitment to healthy lifestyles.  In any case, the comparison of the results of this study with the previous bibliography is complex given the differences in the populations analyzed and the use of different questionnaires to assess adherence to the MedDi.",4316bd46-d069-452a-9fd3-df54fa92decd
16,discussion2," In this sense, a recent review study( 29 ) identifies up to 28 screening tools for MedDi adherence and defends the need to develop a questionnaire with greater conceptual and methodological rigor.  The participants in this study evidenced a significant and inverse association between MedDi adherence and the prevalence of abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. In the previous literature on the theme, a great variability was observed in the results in relation to this association. In order to clarify these divergences, several secondary studies have been carried out in recent years. In a Cochrane meta-analysis( 30 ) of the MedDi-based intervention studies, significant improvements in total cholesterol and LDL values were demonstrated. However, the available evidence was considered insufficient to draw conclusions about the association between the MedDi and blood pressure.",c10d7427-1138-4bd0-8acc-dc0138e79517
17,discussion3," In 2016, a meta-analysis of studies based on MedDi-based interventions also revealed inverse and significant associations between this dietary pattern and the levels of triglycerides, glycaemia, blood pressure, and abdominal circumference( 31 ). Finally, in a meta-analysis of observational studies from 2017, a lower probability of suffering central obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome was deduced in people with good adherence to the MedDi( 32 ).  This study presents several limitations that may affect the generalization of our results. The population consisted of workers, therefore the findings may not be extrapolated to non-active people. Likewise, it is made up mostly of men (67.5%) who may be representative of the working population of the region but not of the general population. Regarding the association between MedDi monitoring and the prevalence of CV risk factors, another two limitations should be noted.",6d3d0c99-df97-4912-9324-85b4288bc837
18,discussion4," The first is the cross-sectional design of the study, which allows establishing associations but not cause-effect relationships. The second responds to the dichotomization of the nutrition variable based on the monitoring of the MedDi. In this way, other possible dietary patterns that, in one way or another, could qualify the association are excluded from the analysis. Therefore, it is suggested that new research studies be launched to clarify the relationship between MedDi monitoring and the prevalence of CV risk factors, which have longitudinal designs and incorporate, in their analysis, a wider range of eating patterns.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation evaluating the association between MedDi adherence and the prevalence of each of the classic non-behavioral CV risk factors (diabetes, dyslipidemias, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome) in the same population (particularly workers).",e52cc633-c656-481b-9374-b687772114d7
19,discussion5," Apart from the novelty, the main strengths of this study are the large sample size, the standardized data collection procedures (anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory), and the biological plausibility of the different observed associations. All this allows us to establish a reliable map of the CV health and habits of the working population of Aragon (Spain), which can serve as a starting point for the development of strategies (preventive and diagnostic) and health programs.  Conclusion The results of this study show an active population subjected to a high exposure to CV risk factors. This circumstance suggests that the incidence of CV morbidity and mortality will progressively increase in the population. In addition, the low adherence to the MedDi of the working population of Aragon and the inverse association observed between their follow-up and the prevalence of CV risk factors are noteworthy.",eb1dcad4-b1a6-4760-bf71-efb02fa27d90
20,discussion6," Under this prism it seems necessary to implement new social and health policies aimed at promoting a balanced eating pattern such as the MedDi. In this sense, occupational nurses, health surveillance professionals with close proximity and ancestry over the workers, must remain natural leaders. =",1f097fc1-b9e7-4fdb-8af5-519311a02b29
