0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design  This was a cross-sectional study that included 1142 participants from three different cohorts from Catalonia (Spain). The participants were recruited from two geographical areas in northeastern Spain (Lleida and Barcelona). The study population included 222 individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 252 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 668 individuals without diabetes. Detailed descriptions of the study cohorts can be found in previously published studies [16,17,18]. The inclusion criteria of individuals with T1DM were as follows: diagnosis of T1DM of more than 1-year duration and age > 18 years. In the T2DM group, individuals with a diagnosis of T2DM aged between 40 and 75 years were included. In the group without diabetes, the inclusion criteria were being over 25 years old and having normal glucose tolerance.",fdd8eff9-71cd-4539-a47d-bbd0c315852e
1,methods1," The exclusion criteria for all participants were as follows: being a healthcare professional, participants who showed mental disorders, a history of previous cardiovascular disease or diabetic foot disease, chronic kidney disease (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min or a urine albumin/creatinine ratio over 300 mcg/g), pregnancy, and other conditions that could influence the study results. Furthermore, individuals without diabetes were also excluded if they had a fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values above 100 mg/dL and 5.7% (39 mmol/mol), respectively. The local Ethics Committee from the different participating institutions, Primary Health Care University Research Institute (institutions Primary Health Care University Research Institute (IDIAP)) Jordi Gol (P12/043), University Hospital Arnau de Vilanova (CEIC 1079), and University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (PI-15-147) approved the study.",f810b4e1-56f5-4ea9-9405-81cb0b87b599
2,methods2," Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants.  2.2. Clinical Data  Blood samples were collected to determine biochemical variables using standard lab procedures. Furthermore, clinical and sociodemographic data were collected from anamnesis and medical records. Anthropometric variables (i.e., weight, height, and body mass index [body mass index (BMI)]) were obtained by standardized methods [19,20]. The use of any antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs was used to define the presence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, respectively. Regular physical activity was defined as performing any kind of physical activity (such as walking) for more than 25 min/day (i.e., 4 Metabolic Equivalents [METS]), and sedentarism was defined if the physical activity lasted less than 25 min/day according to Bernstein et al. [21] and Cabrera de León et al. [22]. Tobacco exposure was determined including former and current smokers.  2.3.",eaa16281-e6a0-4231-a805-77668dd8dc7d
3,methods3," Dietary Pattern Assessment  Diet was assessed using the validated 101-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire consumption (food frequency questionnaire consumption (FFQC)) [23,24]. This was individually administered by specialized and trained researchers. The food frequency questionnaire consumption (FFQC) collects data on habitual food consumption in the past year prior to the visit. The dietary pattern was assessed using two dietary quality indexes: the alternate Mediterranean Diet score (aMED) and the alternate Healthy Eating Index (aHEI) [25,26]. The aMED scores range from 0 (minimum) to 9 (maximum). This index includes essential components of the traditional MDiet such as healthy fats derived from olive oil, nuts, and fish, a low intake of saturated fat, and a diet rich in legumes, vegetables, fruits, cereals, meat, and wine [25]. The aHEI scores range from 0 (unhealthy eating) to 80 (healthy eating).",6641c497-40a3-48b1-9cb6-f1cbba8789e0
4,methods4," The evaluation includes the consumption of vegetables, fruit, nuts and soy, white and red meat, cereal fiber, polyunsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid ratio, trans fat, and alcohol consumption [26]. Three groups (tertiles) (i.e., low, moderate, and high adherence to the MDiet diet) were defined as an aMED score of 0–3, 4 and 5–9, respectively, and an aHEI score of 20–37, 38–43, and 44–68 (representing the first [T1], second [T2] and third tertile [T3]).  The US Department of Agriculture food composition tables and other Spanish and English food sources were used to estimate nutrient intake [27,28,29]; this was adjusted for energy intake.  2.4. Advanced Lipoprotein Profile  The advanced lipoprotein profile of plasma samples was performed using two-dimensional diffusion-ordered 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (2D DOSY) Liposcale® [4].",6c44f4ad-7aeb-4174-9a2e-7c680491420b
5,methods5," The Liposcale® test consists of the analysis of the attenuation of the signals of lipid peaks when they are subjected to a known magnetic field gradient. Under the influence of radiofrequency pulses, lipoproteins resonate at slightly different frequencies depending on their size, generating a spectrum of these frequencies; thus, the smaller the lipoprotein, the lower the resonance frequency of the lipids in its nucleus. Therefore, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based analytical techniques, it is possible to measure the size of lipoproteins directly [4,30]. Nine lipoprotein subclasses (large, medium, and small Vlow density lipoprotein (LDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL)), the size and particle number of three different classes of lipoproteins (Vlow density lipoprotein (LDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL)) and the lipid concentrations (i.e., triglycerides and cholesterol) were assessed using this method.  2.",d627d6bb-17d4-4e90-bc90-a0833eadbcde
6,methods6,"5. Statistical Analyses  A descriptive analysis of all the variables was performed, summarizing the quantitative variables with the mean and standard deviation and the qualitative variables with the frequency and the percentage. A comparison of the characteristics between groups (i.e., low, moderate, and high adherence to the MDiet according to the T1, T2 and T3 tertiles of the aMED and aHEI) was carried out using the chi-square test for qualitative variables, and the ANOVA test, for quantitative variables. The compare Groups R package [31] was used to perform the calculations and tables.  To assess the advanced lipoprotein profile and the dietary quality index of the participants, each lipoprotein parameter was compared between the groups using the ANOVA test. Furthermore, adjusted analysis of association of each lipoprotein versus aMED and aHEI using regression linear models.",1f22f028-e529-4005-ab78-4e1455750871
7,methods7,"  The variables included in the models was the known confounding factors related to lipoprotein profile and the dietary quality: diabetes mellitus, sex, age, physical activity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, body mass index (BMI), and tobacco exposure. The family type I error was prefixed at 0.05, but the Benjamini and Hochberg corrections were applied for multiple comparisons to control the false discovery rate (p. adjust function from stats R package). The statistical analyses were performed using R3.6.1 [32].  3. Results  The clinical and demographic characteristics of the participants related to the dietary quality indexes are shown in Table 1. Participants with a greater adherence to the aMED tended to be older, while participants with a greater adherence to the aHEI were also older and tended to be women (64%). Participants in the second tertile of the aMED and the third tertile of the aHEI (moderate and high adherence, respectively) showed poorer glycemic control (mean (SD) 6.7 (1.",f76b8653-8c00-46c6-b5e4-bc0847ca27bf

Moreover, participants in the second tertile of the aMED and aHEI showed a higher waist circumference (97.3 (14.3); p = 0.013, and 96.0 (13.9); p = 0.054, respectively) compared with the first and third tertiles of the aMED and aHEI. Additionally, similar results were found when stratifying the study sample according to the type of diabetes (Tables S1 and S2).

Dietary Intake of the Study Subjects  Furthermore, as expected, participants with higher scores of aMED and aHEI showed a higher nutrient intake of polyunsaturated fat, omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids in comparison with participants allocated in the first and second tertiles (Table S3). Moreover, participants allocated in the third tertile of aMED and aHEI showed a healthier daily food intake, with exception for the consumption of sugar, in comparison with participants in the first and second tertiles (Table S3).  3.2.",857750d5-8b8b-4be8-860a-3f1c7214ffd6
10,methods10," Advanced Lipoprotein Profile and Mediterranean Diet  The advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP) according to the dietary quality index groups is shown in Table 2. Participants in the third tertile of the aMED (high adherence) showed higher levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-TG (mean (SD) 17.5 (5.0); p = 0.037), medium low density lipoprotein (LDL)-P (434.0 (143.0); p = 0.037), and large high density lipoprotein (HDL)-P (0.3 (0.1); p = 0.037) compared with participants in the first and second tertiles. Furthermore, participants in the second tertile of the aMED showed higher levels of intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL)-C (11.3 (5.1); p = 0.037) compared with participants in the first and third tertiles. In terms of the advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP) and aMED, no differences were observed between T1DM and T2DM participants (Table S5).",4237e81e-59ea-4c79-ae91-a96cac85d228

Additional analysis of the study subjects by age revealed that the advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP) in participants under age 50 with a higher adherence to the MDiet showed higher levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-TG, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL)-C, large high density lipoprotein (HDL), and non-high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in comparison with those in the first and second tertiles of the aMED (Table S6).",44d52f7f-1dff-4c58-b7b2-348bf108acc4

18,methods18," The findings that participants with more CV-related morbidities have higher aMED and aHEI scores may be due to them adhering to educational dietary interventions with the aim of improving their CV health.  A previous study showed that higher intake of either red or white meat, was associated with higher concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C and large low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles [33]. Furthermore, higher intake of fish in postmenopausal women has been associated with higher levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, while dietary omega-3 was associated with increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) size and large high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles [13]. Moreover, fish and seafood consumption has been associated with higher levels of large low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C particles [34].",d3771a82-0845-49c8-bbe8-1f1954c3b20e
19,methods19," In the present study, participants with higher aMED and aHEI scores had a higher consumption of white meat, fish and seafood, and lower intake of red meat and processed meat. However, they had an advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP) profile associated with higher CV risk, which is in contrast with the published studies [13,34,35].  In the context of the MDiet, the concept that an elevated adherence to this type of diet relates to decreased low density lipoprotein (LDL) atherogenicity has been reported in some [7,8], but not all studies [9,10]. Similarly, the serum concentration of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-P did not differ among the different subgroups of either the aMED or aHEI.",c99837d9-e7fc-488e-b8a5-91710e92a2d7

In contrast, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, TG, and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentrations did not differ among different tertiles of adherence to the aHEI. i.e., low, moderate and high adherence. Importantly, our advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP) analysis uncovered hidden proatherogenic lipoprotein characteristics in participants with the highest aMED and aHEI scores.",28c073a0-01c2-4bb4-ac46-0a507d7a6c87
21,methods21," Indeed, the serum concentration of medium-sized low density lipoprotein (LDL) was significantly increased in people with the highest adherence according to the aMED. Since the medium low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclass determined using the Liposcale® method in our subjects corresponds in size to the smaller low density lipoprotein (LDL) according to the Liposcience® range criteria, our findings suggest that smaller and hence more atherogenic low density lipoprotein (LDL)s are present in the circulation in the group of participants with the highest adherence to the MDiet. In line with this view, medium low density lipoprotein (LDL)s have been associated with an elevated incidence of CV disease [37], by virtue of their elevated susceptibility to be oxidized [8].  Compelling evidence suggests that higher levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) size, and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-P concentration are inversely associated with CV risk [38].",f8eaf8a9-31fb-4eee-bc4e-0ace90fc90b2
22,methods22," Furthermore, elevated large high density lipoprotein (HDL) are considered antiatherogenic particles [7,15,35]. Although in a study the subjects with the highest adherence scores according to the aHEI showed an improved conventional lipid profile and lower risk of CV disease [39], this was not reproduced in a recent independent study where the adherence to healthy dietary recommendations was not associated with a lower CV disease risk [40]. Our data show that the serum concentration of the large high density lipoprotein (HDL)-P subclass was significantly elevated in participants with higher score of aMED and aHEI. Although the actual clinical significance of this finding needs further investigation and could be irrelevant, as suggested by our study and others.",83cdb18a-ea27-4013-9ff0-4b44cd7348b8
23,methods23,"  Although previous studies have described that women have an improved advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP) in comparison with men [41], we did not observe significant differences in the advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP) between men and women. Nevertheless, post-menopausal women have been reported to have an atherogenic lipid profile due to an elevation of almost all cholesterol-carrying particles [42]. However, in the current study, only younger women (aged below 50) with a higher adherence to the MDiet showed higher levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-TG, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL)-C, large high density lipoprotein (HDL) and non-high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. We should be cautious about the interpretation of these findings as this is just a sub-analysis of our sample that should not lead to any conclusion.",e9ba3364-b3e4-467e-aa05-06cb719b7763
24,methods24," Moreover, in contrast with our findings, an altered lipoprotein profile has been reported in subjects with diabetes compared with normoglycemic participants [43].  The current study had several limitations. A causal relationship between study variables cannot be established due to the cross-sectional study design. Additionally, the impact of possible changes in dietary habits produced over time could not be addressed in this study. In addition, the absence of differences in the advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP) between dietary patterns may be, at least in part, explained by the sample size. Furthermore, the low variability of the dietary patterns may be partially attributed to the fact that all participants belong to the same region. Moreover, this study does not account for genetic variations potentially contributing to particle size. Nevertheless, the study has several strengths.",2dd00e5f-1ff4-48ae-9d4a-2822d3ca35e4
25,methods25," This is the first study to assess the relationship between the advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP) and the dietary pattern measured by the aMED and aHEI in adults from a Mediterranean area. Since the fatty acid intake profile has an impact on advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP), a comprehensive assessment of their intake was better assessed by the two dietary indexes. These dietary quality indexes allowed us to identify, on the one hand, trans-fat intake and the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fats through the aHEI and, on the other hand, the ratio of monounsaturated lipids to saturated lipids through aMED [25,26]. The large number of participants and the multicenter design may allow the results to be translated to other populations. Of note, we included a well-characterized sample without the presence of previous CV disease, while still maintaining the variability of participant characteristics and lifestyles that are a benefit of real-world studies.",51624b53-bafa-4424-8604-5aaeca937a68
26,methods26," Finally, we used the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to analyze the advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP), which is considered the most precise method to assess lipoprotein variations.  5. Conclusions  The quantitative characteristics of lipoproteins revealed by the advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP) analysis were not associated with any of the dietary patterns in the studied population after adjusting for confounding variables. However, the potential role of the dietary pattern on the advanced lipoprotein profile (ALP) needs to be further studied. ",f835c5c3-fd61-42df-b154-186a4c60929c
