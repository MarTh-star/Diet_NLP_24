0,introduction0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (antiretroviral therapy (ART)) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has significantly improved life expectancy.1 However, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients are increasingly experiencing metabolic complications, such as dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance, that increase cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), which is now the commonest cause of death in the optimally treated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population.1 The cluster of dyslipidaemia, smoking and poor-quality diets appears to drive the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population.2 However, when compared with case-matched controls, people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection exhibit a 50% increased risk of myocardial infarction beyond that explained by recognised risk factors.",0d0724b9-68c1-40b1-b495-62b075dfde7b
1,introduction1,"3 Therefore, other factors have been proposed for the excess cardiovascular disease (CVD) observed, including the actions of specific antiretroviral drugs and the direct impact of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus. Specific antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs have been observed to be associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction in a large international cohort;4 this effect is only partly explained by their effect on lipids.5 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection per se potentially increases cardiovascular (CV) risk via mechanisms involving inflammation,6 7 CD4 cell count depletion,8 altered coagulation,9 dyslipidaemia,10 impaired arterial elasticity11 and endothelial dysfunction.12 In summary, the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is elevated in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population via multiple mechanisms.  Dyslipidaemia is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.",23ce1c4e-e4f1-42d2-a874-10adafca36d7
2,introduction2," The current international guidelines recommend dietary intervention as the first-line treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) dyslipidaemia.13–15 These guidelines are based on targeting the general population16 17 where dietary advice, with emphasis on reduction of saturated fat, has been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and mortality.18 Presuming that the reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk achieved by dietary intervention in the general population will be mirrored in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population is problematic for two reasons. First, because the precise underlying mechanism of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is unclear19 and there is a need to consider multiple factors such as infection, inflammation and antiretroviral treatment.",0feeeb57-aea3-4333-b014-be7fcc808191
3,introduction3," Second, there is debate over the focus on saturated fat reduction in the absence of consideration of the source of the saturated fat (vegetable or animal fats) and the nature of the carbohydrates it displaces.  Given the uncertainties regarding the impact of dietary interventions on cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population, this study set out to clarify the potential of the dietary intervention on modifying low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), a major marker of increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population.  Rationale for intervention Saturated fat and the National Cholesterol Education Program Our meta-analysis of pooled results from four randomised controlled trials (randomised controlled trial (RCT)s) demonstrated a clinical benefit of dietary intervention in reducing triglycerides by −0.46 mmol/L (95% CI −0.85 to −0.",95e3ae03-cebc-483e-8567-0857473ee893
4,introduction4,"07 mmol/L) over an average treatment period of 8 months in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients on antiretroviral therapy, but reported no effects on LDL-cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol).20 That review clearly identified the need for well-designed, robust trials. One subsequent trial suggested an improvement in HDL-cholesterol and highly sensitive C reactive protein (a marker of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk) as secondary outcomes, although it was likely underpowered to assess the effects of lifestyle modification on these.21 However, the lack of effect on LDL-cholesterol may indicate that the interventions used (National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet emphasising reduction in saturated fat to 7% of total calories) are insufficient to independently alter human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) dyslipidaemia and associated CV risk.",76aa4e67-e221-48e2-a5ec-602bbba73391
5,introduction5,"  Mediterranean Diet The Mediterranean Diet is characterised by: high consumption of olive oil, legumes, unrefined cereals, fruits and vegetables, and moderate consumption of dairy products, fish and wine, but low consumption of meat. The Mediterranean Diet has been examined in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cohort studies, with reports of no association between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and plasma lipid changes during the first year of antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment.22 Favourable associations have been reported with insulin resistance and HDL-cholesterol in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), but only in those with fat redistribution, such as visceral fat accumulation and/or subcutaneous fat wasting.23 One parallel, randomised trial has been conducted in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population, comparing low-fat NCEP diet versus the same with additional Mediterranean components.",53d76cae-223c-4de8-9ce6-305e2b7e33fc
6,introduction6," The findings were unfavourable in both arms, with increases in triglyceride levels in the NCEP group and increases in cholesterol levels in the modified Mediterranean group. It was, however, a pilot study, and variance was not reported, making interpretation difficult.24  Despite the lack of available evidence in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population, the strength of the effects of the Mediterranean Diet documented in the non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population cannot be ignored. Its importance is evident from observational cohort studies,25 a secondary prevention trial,26 and a primary prevention trial27 demonstrating substantial reduction in CV morbidity and mortality. In a Spanish population at high CV risk, but with no disease present, the Mediterranean Diet reduced the incidence of major CV events by 30% (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89).",a595d0d6-29ea-45fe-9074-a0d71530a908
7,introduction7,"27 Despite the large benefit seen in clinical end points, the effect on blood lipids was less dramatic, with no significant difference in LDL-cholesterol between the Mediterranean Diet and Low Fat Diet groups due to similar reductions of 0.15 mmol/L. The Mediterranean Diet appears to benefit HDL-cholesterol, with increased levels of 0.08 mmol/L (95% CI 0.04 to 0.10) producing a reduction in total cholesterol to HDL ratio.28 One UK study has explored the feasibility of implementing the Mediterranean Diet in a non-Mediterranean setting, demonstrating that Northern European cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients could adopt and maintain a Mediterranean Diet.29  Functional foods and the Portfolio Diet American guidelines have recommended the use of functional foods as additional options to enhance the effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering diets.",df6eb07f-754c-4949-bb4a-6d1b444aefb9
8,introduction8,"  Foods with cholesterol-lowering properties have been examined in clinical trials in the general population, demonstrating 6% reductions in LDL-cholesterol with 15 g/day soya protein;30 7–10% reductions with 2 g/day plant stanols;31 3–5% reductions with 3 g/day β-glucans in oats;32 and a dose-dependent effect of 1% LDL-cholesterol reduction with every 4–11 g of nut consumption.33 When these cholesterol-lowering foods (plant sterols, soy protein, viscous fibre and almonds) were combined into a ‘Portfolio Diet’, the effect was magnified, producing an LDL-cholesterol reduction of −1.36 mmol/L (29%) in short-term feeding trials.34 Reductions of 29% were sustained at 1 year in a free-living trial, under real-life conditions, but only for the one-third of the participants who achieved complete adherence. The treatment effect was halved to 13% LDL-cholesterol reduction (−0.61 mmol/L)35 in the intention-to-treat analysis, but was still impressive.",77f685ea-b34d-49ab-baba-6aba34b35fec
9,introduction9," This finding was consistent with LDL-cholesterol reductions of 14% (−0.67 mmol/L) in another free-living trial of 6 months, where adherence to the portfolio components was only 46%.36  Motivational interviewing Dietary interventions are a form of behavioural intervention to help improve adoption of behaviour change. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)) guidelines (2007) recommend selecting interventions that motivate and support people to feel positive about the benefits of health-enhancing behaviours.37 These recommendations apply to motivational interviewing, which has been shown to be effective in the domain of diet and exercise.38 Motivational interviewing was developed by Miller and Rollnick, and subsequently ascribed to the transtheoretical model of change.",a2397bf7-946d-41ec-b737-929534600603
10,introduction10,"39 Motivational interviewing is based on four key principles: expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance and enhancing self-confidence. Systematic reviews in obesity management,40 diabetes prevention41 and CV risk reduction in high-risk groups,42 indicate that such robust behavioural change strategies are key to effective lifestyle change programmes. Guidelines for diabetes prevention43 and obesity prevention/management44 recommend individual level intervention using established, well-defined behaviour change techniques (goal setting, relapse prevention, self-monitoring, motivation interviewing, prompting self-talk, individual tailoring and time management). In this study, motivational interviewing will facilitate the development of individualised approaches to support behaviour change in relation to diet, enhance participant self-efficacy and motivate participants to change, achieve their goals and maintain behaviours.",cd889012-3c35-4823-bdc3-3b207692bf82
11,introduction11,"  Intervention proposed for this trial The hypothesis of the current study is to combine the effect observed in the general population of the CV event reduction from the Mediterranean Diet with the cholesterol reduction from the functional foods of the Portfolio Diet. This dietary advice is to be delivered in the motivational interviewing style, as advocated by HEantiretroviral therapy (ART) UK in their Ultimate Cholesterol Lowering Plan (Ultimate Cholesterol Lowering Plan (UCLP)), which is also based on the Portfolio Diet. Therefore, this study aims to examine whether a diet that is low in saturated fat, and incorporates cholesterol-lowering foods and a Mediterranean Diet style, reduces blood lipid levels in patients with stable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on antiretroviral treatment.",6eec6092-e274-41bb-8051-028297ab4b94
12,introduction12,"  The study is not designed to determine which of the food or nutrient components are responsible for the effect observed, but to assess the combined impact of the two dietary patterns (low saturated fat and Mediterranean Portfolio Diet) on LDL-cholesterol. The reason for investigating dietary patterns rather than examining isolated nutrients is that they are more relevant to the ways people choose their foods and the possibility of observing the potential additive or synergistic effects of combining different dietary components.45  A parallel pilot trial design with an active comparator was selected for two reasons. First to ensure that entering the study would not disadvantage participants who had access to dietary advice as part of their current standard of care.

When in doubt, the opinion and approval of the trial investigation team will be sought.  Sample size A CI approach was used to estimate the sample size required to establish feasibility.48 The criterion for success is that the definitive trial will be feasible if the attrition rate is <20% (or complete follow-up in at least 80% of all recruited participants). With a sample size of 60 participants, the expected attrition rate of 20% can be estimated with a 20% (95% CI 10% to 30%) margin of error.",30f301cc-b22d-487a-b63f-32d88afbfd45

Methods of recruitment will be compared: difference between recruitment rate from systematic methods (screening results) and ad hoc methods (posters, referral by multidisciplinary team). Reasons will be sought for declined participation. Appropriateness of eligibility criteria and their practical application for definitive trial will be explored.",df88770b-9d9f-4c5c-bc3f-8106d9fcb8f2
37,introduction37,"  Attrition rate is defined as both discontinuation and loss to follow-up of participants at 6 months. Logistic regression will be conducted to assess whether completion is associated with age, gender or allocation preference. Reasons for discontinuation will be sought from participants. The target of 20% (with precision of 10%) is based on the mean attrition rate from five Portfolio Diet studies (13%) and systematic review evidence (18%),20 although attrition has ranged from 25%24 to 42%73 in other human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diet studies. Acceptability of the intervention and group allocation will be explored by questionnaire, and assessed by comparing attrition rates between the two groups.  Attendance to appointments, collection of supplied foods and completion of food diaries will be used as indicators of participation and study compliance.",84f8cc91-1d3d-48da-823d-d6bd26e79c16
38,introduction38,"  Statistical analysis plan Descriptive findings will be explored regarding numbers recruited, completing, dropping out and summary characteristics of each arm at baseline. CI estimation, not p value, will be used as the appropriate analysis for pilot studies.74 For all binary outcomes, we will therefore compute the number and proportion in each arm, and 95% CI.  Exploratory analysis of the treatment effect will be conducted. Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted with participants as originally allocated at randomisation to avoid bias. Significance levels will be set at <0.05 with two-tailed tests. Effect size for the performance outcomes will be explored using and used subsequently in the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with adjustment for baseline value,75 and we will report mean differences in outcomes between arms with 95% CIs. SD of each outcome will be estimated, to inform the power calculation for a definitive trial.",6f743a20-0070-4644-92eb-8baa79609067
39,introduction39,"  Further exploratory analysis will be piloted to highlight any potential modifications required for the definitive trial. This will include integrating process and outcome data to maximise the interpretation of results.76 For example, to address the question of the relationship between LDL-cholesterol and variation in adherence levels to the diet, on-treatment analysis will be used, in which results for participants who adhered to the diet will be compared with results from those allocated to the diet (standard intention-to-treat approach). To address the question regarding differences in responses to the intervention between subgroups of participants, regression analysis will be used in the definitive trial (as the power will be insufficient in the pilot study), with tests for interactions to identify participants most and least likely to benefit from the intervention.",09789af1-6aa7-4d65-842b-94ded071c962
40,introduction40,"  Although this trial is not sufficiently powered to compare outcome between intervention arms, estimates of differences between arms will be compared. In the event that the effect of the intervention is large (in the region of 0.5 mmol/L or 10% difference in LDL-cholesterol reduction between groups at 6 months) this study will have sufficient power and it will be important not to miss such large effect sizes if they exist.  Dissemination The Trial Steering Committee will provide overall trial supervision. The main ethical consideration is to ensure that the risk of harm to participants is minimised and that they are fully informed of any risks. Lipid lowering agents are not permitted during the trial. Should an individual's LDL-cholesterol rise above >5 mmol/L, this will be recorded as an adverse event and they will be withdrawn from the study, with general practitioner referral for appropriate medication.",40828893-15ee-473a-8844-a7049a56d97e
41,introduction41,"  The research dietitian, at study visits, will monitor the condition of the participants during the trial, requesting evaluation of potential harms by the participants’ human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) physician during routine clinic visits. All adverse events, whether considered trial-related or not, will be documented in the participant's case report form, and reported to the Trial Steering Committee and Sponsor.  Participants will be free to withdraw from the study at any time. If participants withdraw from the intervention, they will be asked if they would allow data to be collected at routine clinic appointments.  Electronic trial data will be entered into the encrypted and password protected trial computer, stored on the secure hospital server and archived for 5 years after study completion. Paper copies will be held in the research office for purposes of potential data checking, and shredded 1 year after study completion. ",a67addf5-9fec-4b01-9fda-88d184fb02ed
42,discussion0,"This study is timely for several reasons. First, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the largest cause of mortality in the UK77 and will continue to rise in the ageing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population. Second, current guidelines recommend dietary intervention as first-line treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) dyslipidaemia.13–15 These recommendations are based on guidelines for the general population16 17 where dietary advice, with emphasis on reduction of saturated fat, has been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and mortality.18 Presuming that the reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) achieved by dietary intervention in the general population will be mirrored in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population is problematic, given the complexity of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population and the potential of different contributing mechanisms.",972d880e-44bf-4189-82a7-095f53926a57
43,discussion1,"19 Third, there are no studies on dietary intervention, of any kind, in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population in the UK. Also, there are no known studies on cholesterol-lowering foods, nor on the Portfolio Diet, in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population internationally. Components of this diet have been incorporated into the Ultimate Cholesterol Lowering Plan (UCLP) (HEantiretroviral therapy (ART) UK), but have yet to be evaluated in the UK population. Therefore, findings from this feasibility study utilising the Mediterranean Portfolio Diet in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population could potentially inform the acceptability of this diet in the wider population.",95ecff86-6118-49df-9ce1-b9da261950e1
44,discussion2,"  As indicated by the lack of effect found with diets low in saturated fat, further studies with interventions of greater intensity and sufficient duration are required to elucidate the full potential of dietary intervention, and to ascertain whether modifying the known marker of increased risk (LDL-cholesterol) modifies the risk itself (cardiovascular disease (CVD)). Therefore, this study aims to examine whether a diet low in saturated fat, which also incorporates functional foods and a Mediterranean style, reduces blood lipid levels in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. If this dietary intervention can significantly reduce blood lipid levels, patients may have the option of reducing their CV risk without the need for lipid-lowering medications (with attendant increasing pill and side effects) or switching antiretroviral drugs (with the potential risk of losing virological control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)).",d1b6dca4-5b80-4bf0-ac5c-f2027a7b0f11
45,discussion3," A reduction of 1 mmol/L in LDL-cholesterol reduces the risk of dying from heart disease by nearly 20% in the general population,78 but this has not been ascertained in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population.  Piloting this trial format will be important in determining any feasibility challenges and will be used to estimate the time, resources and sample size required for a full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) to answer these questions.
