0,background0,"Case-control, cohort, and prospective epidemiological studies have generated conflicting results regarding a protective effect of an olive oil (OO)-rich Mediterranean diet against several malignancies, especially breast cancer [1-5]. It has been assumed that, if protective agents (e.g. monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid and/or antioxidants from olive oil and raw vegetables) are largely present in the diet of a population with a low risk of acquiring solid tumors (i.e. dietary patterns found in olive-growing areas of the Mediterranean basin), these diet-based anti-cancer mechanisms should influence the occurrence of all or most types of cancer. Sant et al. [6], by analyzing the data of the ORDET prospective study on hormones, diet and breast cancer [7], have recently suggested that the effects of the Mediterranean diet on breast cancer risk might be underestimated when HER2 (ERBB2) oncogene-positive and HER2-negative breast carcinomas are considered together.",91e6ed14-2a1d-4011-8974-6f2abb10f9c0
1,background1," The Type I receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs) HER2 regulates biological functions as diverse as cellular proliferation, transformation, differentiation, motility and apoptosis. HER2 is therefore one of the most commonly analyzed proto-oncogenes in human cancer studies, as it plays a pivotal role in oncogenic transformation, tumorigenesis, and metastasis [8-12]. HER2 gene is amplified and/or overexpressed in ~20% to 30% of invasive breast carcinomas and is associated with unfavorable prognosis, shorter relapse time, and decreased overall survival [8-12].",e7855622-18b7-4033-8792-16309bb8571f
2,background2,"  Although one observational study is not sufficient and consistency of findings across multiple cohort and case-control studies is paramount to definitely establish whether the protective effect of a diet rich in raw vegetables and OO is largely restricted to HER2-positive breast carcinomas, when considering experimental and epidemiological evidence together it is reasonable to suggest that dietary factors influencing the occurrence of HER2-positive breast carcinomas may differ from those influencing the occurrence of HER2-negative cancers [6]. Moreover, an OO, salad and vegetable-rich dietary pattern might specifically exert a protective effect against HER2-positive breast cancer because the (anti-cancer) mechanism of action of some of its components largely depends on their ability to suppress HER2 expression. We previously demonstrated that an experimental diet with a high content in Extra Virgin OO (i.e.",4bfd0776-6df6-4f4d-af71-97fbf2eed6c9
3,background3," the juice of the olive obtained solely by pressing and consumed without any further refining process) acted as a negative modulator on the promotion stage of dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA))-induced mammary tumors in rats by conferring to the tumors a more benign clinical behavior and lower histopathological malignancy [13]. Mechanistically, both in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that oleic acid (OA; 18:1n-9) – the main Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)'s monounsaturated fatty acid (monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)) – transcriptionally suppressed the expression of HER2 gene [14-19]. We recently described that the polyphenol oleuropein aglycone, a non-glyceridic constituent of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), was capable to reverse breast cancer acquired autoresistance to the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin™) [20].",efaa2278-51b1-4a24-956e-3e05f72fd5fa
4,background4," However, the HER2-related anti-breast cancer activities of polyphenolic compounds present in the soluble fraction of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) other than oleuropein aglycone, which have been suggested to contribute the oxidative stability of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), and as such are often associated with the health benefits of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) [21-24], remained to be fully evaluated.  We here designed a systematic approach to investigate the effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)-derived polyphenol compounds on the expression and oncogenic activity of the HER2 tyrosine kinase in human breast cancer-derived cell lines. Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) is unique among other vegetable oils because of its high level of phenolic compounds [25-29]. These levels are possible because it is obtained from the olive fruit (Olea Europea L.) solely by mechanical means, without further treatment other than washing, filtration, decantation, or centrifugation (Figure 1).",82463557-6610-459f-b4b6-240ab7b51ebb
5,background5," To evaluate a potential therapeutic role for Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols it is important to either synthesize or isolate individual compounds. Synthesis is currently not practical and, therefore, isolation procedures must be used. First, solid phase extraction followed by semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)) was used to isolate phenolic fractions from commercial Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO). Second, analytical capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS) was performed to check for the composition of the isolated phenolic fractions and to confirm their identity. Third, the effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) phenolic fractions on breast cancer cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using measured using a tetrazolium salt based (MTT), crystal violet staining, and Cell Death ELISA assays, respectively.",397f1ca8-6094-411c-90aa-e568527f7b25
6,background6," Fourth, the effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) phenolic fractions on the expression levels and the activation status of HER2 oncoprotein were evaluated using HER2-specific ELISAs and immunoblotting procedures, respectively. Fifth, we preliminary addressed the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-HER2 effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)-derived polyphenols.  Figure 1 Chromatogram of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) sample using semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

We report for the first time that all the fractions containing the major Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols (i.e. the secoiridoids deacetoxy oleuropein aglycone, ligstroside aglycone, oleuropein aglycone and the lignans [+]-pinoresinol and 1-[+]-acetoxypinoresinol) can efficiently inhibit HER2 protein kinase activity by depleting the HER2 protein kinase itself. We suggest that the stereochemistry of these phytochemicals might provide an excellent and safe platform for the design of new HER2-targeted anti-breast cancer drugs.

The semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column used was a Phenomenex Luna (C18) column, 10 μm i.d., 25 cm × 10 mm and the flow rate was 3 mL/min.  Capillary electrophoresis (CE) were performed using a in a P/ACE™ System MDQ (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA, USA). Fused-silica capillaries of 85 cm in length and 50 μm inner diameter (360 μm outer diameter) were used. CE apparatus was coupled to the mass spectrometer detector by an orthogonal electrospray interface (electrospray interface (ESI)).

11,methods3,"  Sample, extraction, isolation and analysis of polyphenol fractions from Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) A 50/50 mixture of two commercial Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) samples (i.e. Picual and Arbequina Spanish varieties) was used for this study. We have used solid phase extraction (solid phase extraction (SPE)) with Diol-cartridges followed by semi-preparative reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to isolate different fractions of phenolic compounds from the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO). Capillary electrophoresis-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (CE-electrospray interface (ESI)-MS) was then employed to establish the composition of the isolated fractions because the principles of separation are completely different to semi-preparative chromatographic employed to isolate the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) fractions [30-37].",4d52f657-ebd9-4990-bf44-2b0059bd0509
12,methods4," The identification of the phenolic compounds was obtained from the accurate mass and the isotopic pattern of the peaks applying electrospray interface (ESI)-TOF-MS analyzer. The actual composition of the isolated phenolic fractions, including experimental m/z, the average molecular weight and, when available, the names of the phenolic compounds, is detailed in Table 1. The fractions 1, 2, 3 and 8 mainly included a single compound (i.e.  hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, elenolic acid and ligstroside aglycone, respectively), while the fractions 4, 5, 6 and 7 included a mixture of several polyphenolic compounds (Figure 2). In order to simplify both the results and the discussion sections, the total composition of fractions 4, 5, 6 and 7 was expressed as the main compound contributing to each fraction (i.e.  deacetoxyoleuropein aglycone – Deacetoxy oleuropein aglycone (DAOA)-, pinoresinol, acetoxypynoresinol and oleuropein aglycone, respectively).",daa36f2a-de47-4b7b-a10b-44a86626431b

For each treatment, cell viability was evaluated as a percentage using the following equation:   >(OD570 of treated sample/OD570 of untreated sample) × 100.   Breast cancer cell sensitivity to agents was expressed in terms of the concentration of drug required to decrease by 50% cell viability (IC50 value). Since the percentage of control absorbance was considered to be the surviving fraction of cells, the IC50 values were defined as the concentration of agents that produced 50% reduction in control absorbance (by interpolation), respectively.",3b76c7b4-ca59-4512-95a6-18f01f4262de
19,methods12,"  Cell proliferation (crystal violet staining) The ability of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenol compounds to affect breast cancer cells proliferation was determined using a crystal violet cell staining assay. Crystal violet is an intense stain binding to the cell nuclei and gives an OD595 reading that is proportional to cell number. Cells were plated and treated as described above (measured using a tetrazolium salt based (MTT) assays). Following treatments, cells were fixed by replacing the growth medium with 100 μl/well of 4% formaldehyde in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (20 minutes, RT).

27,results0,"Effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) phenolic compounds on breast cancer cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis in HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 breast cancer cells We initially assessed the metabolic status of HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 breast cancer cells following treatments with graded micromolar concentrations of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols (6.25 → 100 μM). After 5 days of treatment, cell viability was measured using a tetrazolium salt-based (measured using a tetrazolium salt based (MTT)) assay, and the IC50 value for each Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenol was calculated as described in ""Materials and methods"". Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) single phenols failed to significantly decrease SKBR3 cell viability. Thus, concentrations higher than 100 μM were needed to achieve cytotoxic responses in the presence of hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and elenolic acid (fractions 1, 2 and 3 respectively) (Figure 2).",742774b7-6abb-423c-9984-e36fd22836db

In agreement with the results obtained in cell viability and cell proliferation assays, the lowest degree of apoptotic cell death was achieved upon treatment with hydroxytyrosol and elenolic acid (Figure 4). Treatment with the lignans-rich fractions 5 and 6 notably increased (up to ~10-fold at 100 μM 1-(+)-acetoxypinoresinol) the apoptotic cell death of SKBR3 cells (Figure 4). SKBR3 cells were likewise exquisitely sensitive to secoiridoids-rich fractions 4, 7 and 8 as they exhibited the highest degree of apoptotic cell death following exposure to fraction 4 (Deacetoxy oleuropein aglycone (DAOA), > 5-fold increase), fraction 8 containing (ligstroside aglycone, > 25-fold increase), and fraction 7 (oleuropein aglycone, > 10-fold increase) (Figure 4).",6884e103-70d9-4d6b-9bca-1e87bd879e23

The level of HER2 overexpression achieved in MCF-7/(pBABE)HER2 cells (~70-fold increase when compared to MCF-7/pBABE matched control and MCF-7 parental cells) was comparable to that reported in MCF-7/Her2-18 cells, a well-characterized MCF-7-derived HER2-overexpressing clone engineered to stably express the full-length human HER2 cDNA controlled by a SV40 viral promoter [40].",8438d37e-8b24-4b86-83ee-2d7521db5a6d

For example, treatment with the Deacetoxy oleuropein aglycone (DAOA)-rich fraction 4 increased apoptotic cell death by 17.5-times and 7.1-times in HER2-overexpressing MCF-7/HER2 transfectants and in HER2-negative MCF-7/pBABE matched control cells, respectively (Figure 5).",11172be4-d445-4412-873f-6ed4b71ce8c4

As shown in Figure 6 (left panel), Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) single phenols and Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenol acids were ineffective against HER2-negative MCF-7/pBABE cells while they exhibited weak growth-inhibitory effects against HER2-overexpressing MCF-7/HER2 cells. Remarkably, the fraction 6 containing mainly the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) lignan 1-(+)-acetoxypinoresinol reduced the proliferation rate of MCF-7/HER2 cells by 63%, whereas this reduction was as low as 26% in MCF-7/pBABE matched control cells (Figure 6, middle panel).",7c7def42-31f0-49cd-bc62-a7a62724f67d

To evaluate this hypothesis we examined the effects of long-term treatments (i.e. 48 hours) with graded concentrations of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols on the naturally-occurring overexpression of HER2 protein in SKBR3 cells (Figure 8). At its highest concentration (i.e. 100 μM), the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) single phenol hydroxytyrosol slightly reduced HER2 protein expression by 35%.",368f19d9-3c97-4891-bec4-0b626de7e0c5

Fraction 6-decreased HER2 protein led to a coordinate decrease in HER2 autophosphorylation, which significantly declined after 6 hr and was barely detectable after 24 hr (Figure 11). Although less markedly than fraction 6, the fraction 4 containing mainly the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) secoiridoid Deacetoxy oleuropein aglycone (DAOA) also decreased HER2 protein expression and HER2 tyrosine kinase activity in a time-dependent manner, with the most significant anti-HER2 expression/activity effects occurring after 48 hr (Figure 11).",5b529dd5-b7eb-4188-bbb5-070d834bf919

Accordingly, HER2 mRNA levels did not significantly decline even after 24 hours after treatment with Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols (data not shown).",ea000b1e-c848-474e-9edf-46d923149f91
55,results28," To better delineate the mechanism of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols-mediated HER2 down-regulation, we tested the following hypotheses: 1.) Since all the main polyphenols that occur at high levels in Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) have demonstrated antioxidant activity and antioxidants are believed to be responsible for a number of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)'s biological activities, we envisioned that Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols-induced depletion of HER2 might represent a general response of HER2-overexpressing cancer cells growing upon anti-oxidant conditions. To test this hypothesis MCF-7/HER2 cells and MCF-7/pBABE matched control cells were treated with graded concentrations of the well-established anti-oxidants 6-hydroxy-N-acetylcysteine (NAC, a glutathione precursor and scavenger of reactive oxygen species) and 2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox, a water-soluble vitamin E analogue).",3c40162d-253c-494a-8ded-c0a93ea08e4d

However, treatment with either Trolox or NAC failed to modulate HER2 protein levels in MCF-7/HER2 cells (Figures 3 and 4; Additional file 1). Overall, these results suggest that anti-oxidant agents preferentially suppress the growth of HER2-overexpressing cancer cells, whereas promoting an antioxidant status in HER2-positive breast cancer cells is not sufficient to down-regulate HER2 expression in human breast cancer cells.",3901643d-9a13-435d-af05-b8848388eaea

A role of proteasomal degradation in Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols-mediated HER2 down-regulation was likewise supported by the fact that pre-treatment (2 hr) with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 fully prevented the reduction of HER2 protein levels induced by Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols (Figure 12).",cbba7595-6cc3-41ee-bb47-3d642da7a6dc

Simultaneous exposure of SKBR3 cells to the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab with sub-optimal doses of the 1-(+)-acetoxypinoresinol-rich fraction 6 or the Deacetoxy oleuropein aglycone (DAOA)-rich fraction 4 likewise demonstrated greater decreases in cell viability that did each agent alone (Interaction Indexes < 1.0; Figure 13).",4c92ae43-f614-4d1b-9735-70e90e0221f7

However, it should be noted that Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) consists primarily of triacylglycerols rich in the ω-9 monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) OA and non-glyceridic constitutes comprising approximately 0.5% to 1% Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), which include at least 30 phenolic compounds.",60512252-43e1-4611-bd38-80fb10c21303
65,discussion3," Although we recently presented evidence that the aglycone form of oleuropein – a member of the secoiridoid family of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols that has mainly been implicated in the organoleptic characteristics of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) such as bitterness – significantly enhances the efficacy of anti-HER2 therapeutics in cultured HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells when compared to simple phenols (e.g. tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol) [20], the anti-breast cancer effects of other Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)-derived polyphenols such as the lignan (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol or the secoiridoids deacetoxy oleuropein aglycone and ligstroside aglycone remained to be addressed.  We now provide new insights on the mechanisms by which good-quality OO, i.e. polyphenols rich-Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), may contribute to lower breast cancer risk in a HER2-dependent manner.",f80e3662-39b4-44eb-91dd-6b03717c48f9
66,discussion4," First, Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) phenolic compounds with a simple structure, involving only a single phenol ring might be incapable to exert strong anti-breast cancer actions. Indeed, a more complex (i.e. polyphenolic) structure appears to be required in order to exert these effects. Thus, both the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)-derived single phenols tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol and the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)-derived polyphenol acid elenolic acid exhibited significantly lower anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects than those observed with the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) fractions rich in the complex polyphenols lignans and secoiridoids.",38ede751-e00f-4def-ac41-4eddb01689e0
67,discussion5," Second, when we investigated the tumoricidal effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols against breast epithelial cells bearing different endogenous levels of the HER2 oncogene, it became clear that high levels of HER2 oncoprotein constitute a molecular feature through which Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols exert, at least in part, their anti-breast cancer actions. Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols differentially induced breast cancer cell growth inhibition by promoting apoptotic cell death in HER2-positive breast cancer cells, with marginal tumoricidal effects occurring in HER2-negative breast cancer cells. Moreover, we found that Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols repressed the phosphor-Tyrosine levels of HER2 and also depleted HER2 protein levels.",3a75af5c-d518-4c50-921d-05dd7cc8da92
68,discussion6," The definite mode of action underlying Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols-induced blockade of HER2 tyrosine kinase activity and down-regulation of HER2 protein expression was beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, when considering that the primary mechanism driving HER2 levels in human breast cancer cells is gene amplification and overexpression under the control of the endogenous promoter [44,45], the fact that Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols drastically decreased HER2 protein content regardless the molecular mechanism contributing to HER2 overexpression strongly suggests that Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols do not significantly affect the cellular transcriptional machinery that controls the endogenous HER2 locus in breast cancer cells.",2f4d0140-5fef-435b-bd61-e5978ddb9412
69,discussion7," Mechanistically, and unlike the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) ω-9 monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) OA – which has been found to indirectly suppress the transcriptional activity of HER2 gene by up-regulating the transcriptional repressor PEA3 and inducing formation of inhibitory ""PEA3 transcription factor-PEA3 DNA binding site"" complexes at the HER2 promoter – [18,19] the anti-HER2 effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols appear to relate to the inhibition of HER2 tyrosine kinase activity as a result of HER2 protein depletion. This notion is supported by the following findings: 1.) Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols-induced inhibition of HER2 expression does not reflect a wider and unspecific inhibitory effect against other HER members closely related to HER2 in terms of structure and activity [20]; 2.",d5816cc3-f44e-4dd2-afc5-55244a6afed4
70,discussion8,") siRNA-induced depletion of HER2 protein protects breast cancer cells against Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)-induced cell growth inhibition, thus suggesting that Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols should interact necessarily with the HER2 protein itself to trigger their mechanism of action; 3.) blocking ATP from binding to the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of HER2 upon treatment with a potent, reversible, selective dual-HER1/HER2 TK inhibitor lapatinib prevents Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols-induced inhibition of breast cancer cell growth, thus suggesting that Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) lignans and secoiridoids may function as phosphotyrosine-receptor kinase blockers by competing with ATP; and 4.",7edda478-0bfb-4a3d-81d5-fc2b863c66f5
71,discussion9,") pre-treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 blocks the depletion of HER2 protein induced by Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols, thus suggesting that Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)-derived lignans and secoiridoids can efficiently inhibit HER2 protein kinase activity by depleting the HER2 protein kinase itself. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols directly affect HER2 levels by promoting proteasomal degradation of HER2 as recently described for other structurally-related naturally-occurring polyphenols such as the flavonoids apigenin and luteolin [41-43].  Although our current findings provide new insights on the mechanisms by which good-quality OO, i.e. polyphenols rich-Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), might contribute to lower breast cancer risk in a HER2-dependent manner, extreme caution must be applied when extrapolating in vitro results into clinical practice.",dbfb5eef-715a-41b4-84a6-6c31f9d41658
72,discussion10," One obvious limitation of our current results is that the phenolics that were active (i.e. lignans and secoiridoids) exhibited tumoricidal effects against cultured breast cancer cells at concentrations (> 50 μM) that are unlikely to be achieved in vivo [46-48]. Indeed, it has to be clarified if these compounds will be accessible in the breast tumor tissue in vivo. In this regard, an important step in the body metabolism might be that Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols rapidly split into inactive compounds. In this regard, the secoiridoid oleuropein aglycone is split into hydroxytyrosol or tyrosol and elenolic acid [46-50], both of them notably less effective than the parental secoiridoid in terms of cytotoxicity and HER2 down-regulation. Nevertheless, Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)-derived lignans may represent a different molecular scenario when compared to Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)-derived secoiridoids. Saarinen et al.",0760354a-2c56-4c51-9062-bd14ac981cda
73,discussion11," recently evaluated the accessibility and accumulation of lignans to breast cancer tissue after their oral administration to athymic mice bearing MCF-7 human breast cancer tumors [51]. Importantly, tumor tissue accumulated up to 92% of the lignans levels found in serum, thus suggesting that the anticancer activity of lignans may be due to their direct local effects on the breast cancer tissues. Of note, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial recently evaluated the effects of dietary flaxseed, which has an exceptionally high concentration of lignans on tumor biological markers in postmenopausal patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer [52]. The results of this clinical trial demonstrated that daily intake of 25 g flaxseed can significantly reduce cell proliferation, increase apoptosis, and affect cell signaling by reducing HER2 expression of breast tumors. A 71.0% reduction in HER2 expression and an increase in apoptosis (30.",61b3483d-f5be-4ce6-b799-ebfafdb17e44
74,discussion12,"7%) were observed in the flaxseed, but not in the placebo group. In fact, the total intake of flaxseed correlated with changes in HER2 expression and apoptotic index [52].  Conclusion This study reveals for the first time that all the major families of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenols (i.e. secoiridoids and lignans) represent previously unrecognized phytochemicals that significantly affect breast cancer cell proliferation and survival through a molecular mechanism involving, at least in part, a significant down-regulation of HER2 expression and activity (Figure 14). These findings, together with the fact that that humans have safely been ingesting significant amounts of lignans and secoiridoids as long as they have been consuming olives and Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), strongly suggest that the stereochemistry of these polyphenols might provide an excellent and safe platform for the design of new anti-breast cancer drugs.",1b0344ce-ca76-48e9-aa1b-e7d590da05be
75,discussion13," Although Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)-rich has been linked with reduced breast cancer risk, and experimental studies begin to support the hypothesis of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) phenolics as inhibiting compounds of HER2-related breast cancer growth, important issues such as the accessibility of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)-derived secoiridoids and lignans to tumor tissues should be carefully addressed in animal models and human pilot studies. Only then an appropriate dietary intervention aimed to reproduce the prominent anti-oncogenic features of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) phytochemicals could be viewed as a new molecular approach in the management of HER2-positive breast cancer disease.

76,discussion14," Although an appropriate dietary intervention reproducing the prominent anti-HER2 features of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) polyphenolsmust be carried out in human pilot studies in the future, it is reasonable to suggest that parental and/or semi-synthetic derivatives of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) lignans and secoiridoids might represent previously unrecognized diet-based therapeutic strategies capable to successfully prevent and/or treat HER2-driven natural history of breast cancer disease.
