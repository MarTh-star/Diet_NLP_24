0,methods0,"2.1. Recruitment, Data Collection, and Selection of the Subjects Adult individuals (n = 50, 9 men and 41 women), who had been on a strict gluten free diet (GFD) by at least 6 months, were recruited (May-October 2018) by pharmacies and verbal disclosures.  The subjects enrolled in the study were asked to provide diagnostic reports, bone densitometry, and blood analysis, in particular, white blood cell (WBC) count. Furthermore, additional data useful to characterize the subjects were gathered through questionnaires and included age, sex, body weight (kg), height (m), heart rate (HR, beats/min.), systolic (systolic (SBP)) and diastolic (diastolic (DBP)) blood pressure (mmHg), medical history, postmenopausal state and previous pregnancy and/or spontaneous abortion (for women), use of drugs, supplements and special foods in addition to gluten free (i.e.",0d1df2a7-d76d-4e99-af43-5a7b372325fe
1,methods1,", lactose-free), physical activity level (physical activity level (PAL)), hours/day of exposure to sunlight, smoking habits, and consumption of alcoholic beverages, cocoa, coffee, tea, and herbal infusions. Participants were also asked to indicate their usual frequency of eating out of home (eating out of home (EOH)) at fast food (eating out of home (EOH)-F) or other eating out of home (EOH) (eating out of home (EOH)-R: restaurant, eating out of home (EOH)-P: pizzeria, and eating out of home (EOH)-B: bar).  The body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated dividing body weight (in kg) by squared height (in meter). The physical activity level (physical activity level (PAL)) was classified as low, moderate, and high using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) [42].  In order to evaluate the relationship between diet and Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the following criteria were applied.",12a8c0bf-0e0a-4d9b-b9ae-b3972fb40eec
2,methods2," Exclusion criteria included negative antitransglutaminase (Anti-Tg) at diagnosis. Inclusion criteria included availability of data for Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) calculation (i.e., neutrophil and lymphocyte counts within normal ranges). In order to evaluate the effect of gluten free diet (GFD), delta Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) after gluten free diet (GFD) versus Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) before gluten free diet (GFD) (ΔNeutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR)) was calculated only when white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis was available and subjects were also classified for increase (Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR)-I) or decrease (Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR)-D) of Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) after gluten free diet (GFD) (Figure 1). On the other hand, only subjects who furnished recent (i.e.",2db7bb96-d6cc-49df-bbf7-e6be5f3c54e7
3,methods3,", within a year) complete white blood cell (WBC) counts were included in the evaluation of the effect of adherence to Med diet on Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (Figure 1), and these patients were also grouped on the basis of the cut off value (< below cut off and > over cut off: 2.32) suggested by Sarikaya et al. [8].  2.2. Adherence to Mediterranean Diet Analysis The degree of adherence to the Med diet was calculated with two different scores: the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS-14), assessed through the validated 14-item questionnaire of the PREDIMED study [43], and the MEDScore (Score-55) proposed by Panagiotakos [44]. The latter, unlike the first, includes the consumption of unrefined cereals (UC). Moreover, MDS-14 and Score-55 differ also for other components. Therefore, we classified the separate subgroups that make up the MDS-14 and Score-55: coherent (CO), incoherent (IC), and different (D) as described in Table 1.",dc1c7685-a5a9-4d0d-8c1e-84a1c2c236da
4,methods4," In order to evaluate the contribution of each subgroup, percentages of self MDS-14 and self Score-55 were also calculated (MDS-7CO % self 14, MDS-2IC % self 14, MDS-5D % self 14, Score-30CO % self 55, Score-10IC % self 55, and Score-15D % self 55). In the light of previous evidence [30, 40], subscores and % self for fruits, vegetables, red meat, potatoes, and UC were evaluated separately (MDS-1F, MDS-1V, MDS-1RM, Score-5F, Score-5V, Score-5RM, Score-P, Score-5UC, and their % self scores) (Table 1).  Gluten-free whole unrefined cereals/pseudocereals include buckwheat, quinoa, sorghum, millet, and amaranth flours [45]; however, consumers still show a preference to refined, low fibre cereals.  Therefore, a Score-60 was reached by also adding gluten-free refined cereals (RC, score range 0-5 as for UC), being typical of Med diet [30, 40]. The percentages of Score-60 subgroups were calculated based on self Score-60 (% self 60).  2.3.",9e8c4da1-2e9b-44bd-bfc0-bfe93f48af6b
5,methods5," Statistical Analysis The sample size of this pilot study was chosen on the basis of other studies [30, 46–50].  Categorical variables were expressed as percentages [51] and continuous variables were expressed as means with standard error mean (standard error mean (SEM)). Results showing a normal pattern were analyzed by analysis of variance (analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA)), others by Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks. The significance of the differences between treatments within the same time and those between the different times within the same treatment group was evaluated using Student-Newman-Keuls (normality test Shapiro-Wilk passed) and Dunn's (normality test Shapiro-Wilk failed) methods. The correlations (Spearman correlation) were analyzed among the parameters of interest.  3. Results 3.1.",522df863-82d8-4553-a064-ec8a3f67b14b
6,methods6," Subject Characteristics and Retrospective Analysis Groups had similar disease durations, despite the differences in age between premenopausal (Pre-M) and postmenopausal (Post-M) (Table 2). Age was related to body mass index (BMI) (0.308, p < 0.05), systolic (SBP) (0.586, p < 0.001), and diastolic (DBP) (0.402, p < 0.01). Percentages of overweight, underweight, hypertension (systolic (SBP) > 129/diastolic (DBP) > 84), hypotension (systolic (SBP) < 90/diastolic (DBP) < 60), dyslipidemia (high cholesterol/LDL or low HDL), and hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose > 110) were different between groups (Table 2). Percentages of patients with other diseases have been also presented in Table 2, and all subjects were under drug treatment according to the disease. Higher percentages of other diseases, spontaneous abortions, and allergy were reported by Post-M (Table 2).",2c91fe62-2f1c-47d0-abe1-3be154d1487f
7,methods7," On the other hand, some subjects declared lactose intolerance and/or lactose-free milk consumption (Table 2) and one subject legumes' intolerance.  All subjects, according to selection criteria, had positive anti-Tg (Table 2) at diagnosis, and decreases in anti-Tg were always observed after gluten free diet (GFD), as well as negativization of antiendomysial and antigliadin antibodies, when data were available (71% antiendomysial evaluated and 91% antigliadin evaluated).  Concerning the histological evaluation of the duodenal mucosa, the distribution of subjects in Marsh (I, II, and III) classification at diagnosis is reported in Table 2, but in some cases, the Marsh classification was not used.  High percentages of osteopenia and osteoporosis (Table 3) were found within the recruited subjects, who furnished reports of bone mineral density (BMD) (n = 36 of 46), according to a previous study conducted in Italy [52], and a higher percentage of osteoporosis was found in post-M (Table 3).",6b48ae73-2e8b-4631-bedd-b0ef0acaaf10
8,methods8," The majority of the subjects had a high or moderate physical activity level (PAL), whereas the percentage of smokers was higher in men (Table 3). On the other hand, a common feature was anemia at diagnosis, not always completely reversible following the gluten free diet (GFD) (Table 3). However, no differences were found in T-score for smoking habit (smokers -1.1 ± 0.5, nonsmokers -1.8 ± 0.2) or anemia (anemia at diagnosis -1.4 ± 0.3, no anemia at diagnosis -2.0 ± 0.3; anemia at gluten free diet (GFD) -1.7 ± 0.2, no anemia at gluten free diet (GFD) -1.7 ± 0.5). On the other hand, age was inversely correlated with T-score (-0.400, p < 0.05) and related to hours spent outdoors (autumn/winter, 0.290, p = 0.05; spring/summer 0.409, p < 0.01).  Overall, only half of the subjects furnished reports of vit. D analysis and the majority after gluten free diet (GFD) (Figure 2(a)).",f89b1de1-eca2-4069-a004-3538e658ac83
9,methods9,"  Figure 2(b) reports the distribution of these values with the cut off levels, recently discussed, that progressively increased from 12 to 20 ng/ml and, finally, to 30 ng/ml [53]. Percentages of subjects under osteoporosis treatment and under supplementation with vit. D are shown in Table 3. Only 3 patients (1 man and 2 women, of whom only one supplemented with vit. D) furnished data of vit. D before and after gluten free diet (GFD), and decreases after gluten free diet (GFD) were observed in these cases (-2.2, -6.1, and -25.0 ng/ml).  On the other hand, recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was higher in subjects with osteoporosis compared to osteopenia and normal bone mineral density (BMD), whereas no differences were found in relation to Marsh grade and anemia (Table 4).  Recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was highly correlated with Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at diagnosis (0.593∗∗∗) and less with ΔNeutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (0.",b90b2a97-5903-4ccf-b3c3-7aea27152246
10,methods10,"384∗), whereas the latter was inversely related to Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at diagnosis (-0.443∗∗).  Retrospective analysis showed both positive and negative values for ΔNeutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), with no significant differences between Marsh grade, anemia, bone mineral density (BMD) status (Table 4), and groups (Table 5). On the contrary, differences between groups were observed both in recent and at diagnosis Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (Table 5). Premenopausal previous pregnancy (Pre-MPP) and Post-M had higher Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at diagnosis compared to Men and Pre-M, but higher differences were observed in recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) between Pre-MPP and Men only (Table 5). These data are in line with percentages below and over the cut off suggested by Sarikaya et al. [8], as well as with percentages of increase and decrease Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (Table 5).  3.2.",c298c5bd-0ef5-4fd2-9bb5-9a2727538505
11,methods11," Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Dietary Habits, and Adherence to Med Diet Percentages of subjects with eating out of home (EOH) habits and percentages of consumers of chocolate, black tea, green tea, herbal infusion, coffee, and alcoholic beverages (excluding wine, included in scores of adherence to Med diet) were different between Men, Pre-M, Pre-MPP, and Post-M (Table 6). Two-way analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed by using dietary habit and Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) cut off value as factors. Among subjects' analysis with Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) over the cut off value, recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was higher in subjects who did not have the habit of eating at the bar and lower in chocolate consumers (Table 6). Chocolate consumption was associated with lower recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) even among those with Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) under the cut off value (Table 6).",75164af8-3d5e-4c86-833e-29c28dddb173
12,methods12,"  On the other hand, recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was correlated with Score-55 and Score-60 but not with MDS-14 (Table 7). Concerning the score subgroups and their contribution to the adherence to Med diet, only Score-30CO and Score-5UC (and its % self 55 and self 60) were correlated with recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (Table 7). Score-5UC, Score-30CO, Score-60, MDS-14, MDS-7CO, MDS-2IC, and Score-5RM were all inversely related to years at gluten free diet (GFD) (Table 7). The latter was correlated with MDS-5D % self 14 and self Score-5F and Score-5V (both % self 55 and % self 60) (Table 7). On the other hand, MDS-14, MDS2IC (and its self 14), and Score-5RM and its % self 55 and self 60 were correlated with age at diagnosis, whereas for MDS-5D % self 14 the correlation is inverse (Table 7). Score-5RM and its % self 60 were correlated with age. Despite MDS-14 and Score-55 were correlated (0.576, p < 0.",4e23cc22-35af-421c-9f46-b6b717f3d1a1
13,methods13,"001), only the former was correlated with age and in particular the MDS-2IC (and its % self 14) component (Table 7). MDS-2IC self 14 was significantly lower in Pre-M (Table 8), and this group had also lower consumption of RC compared to Pre-MPP (Table 8) and higher MDS-7CO % self 14 and MDS-1F self 14 compared to Men and Post-M (Table 8).  4. Discussion From 50 subjects, after the selection for anti-Tg at diagnosis, we retrospectively evaluated 46 adult-diagnosed (Table 2) coeliac disease patients at gluten free diet (GFD). In this study, we evaluated Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), being a marker of inflammation in coeliac disease [8, 9] related to postmenopausal osteoporosis [8, 54].  Neither Marsh classification nor anemia was related to recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (Table 5) or T-Score, and the latter also has no significant affected by smoking habit, whereas was correlated with age.",83ddac03-dbb1-4914-8885-691914b8d766
14,methods14,"  A recent interest is born on the role of some genetic polymorphisms in iron-deficiency anemia- (IDA-) persistent CD at gluten free diet (GFD) [55]. On the other hand, there is evidence that bone mineral density (BMD) does not return to normal in coeliacs diagnosed in adulthood and that this finding could be due to menopausal status in women [23] or inflammatory status [24]. In a case report of a 65-year-old postmenopausal woman, hormone replacement therapy, in addition to gluten free diet (GFD) and supplementation, was unable to inhibit the reduction of bone mineral density (BMD) and was therefore prescribed oral ibandronate [56]. In the present study, the use of drugs for osteoporosis has been reported only by some Post-M (Table 3). The use of other drugs was in line with comorbidities (Table 2). In particular, as previously reported [52, 57], autoimmune thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes mellitus are common among coeliac patients.",1c59efd9-9648-4e7b-a976-aceeb6e84b9c
15,methods15," In this context, it has been suggested a synergistic effect of hyperglycemia and coeliac autoimmunity on low bone mineral density (BMD) [58]. Although Post-M presented more comorbidities (Table 2) and osteoporosis (Table 3) and, overall, subjects with osteoporosis had higher recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) compared to patients with osteopenia or normal bone mineral density (BMD) (Table 4), as previously reported [54], Pre-MPP had higher recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (Table 5).  Retrospective analysis revealed that both Pre-MPP and Post-M had higher Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at diagnosis compared to Men and Pre-M (Table 5). However, percentages of subjects with decrease in Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) after gluten free diet (GFD) were lower in Pre-MPP compared to Men, Pre-M, and Post-M (Table 5).  Moreover, a high percentage of patients with recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) over the cut off value, suggested by Sarikaya et al.",dcbc0fa2-e9f9-44fc-9077-fcceeb925d83
16,methods16," [8], have been observed in Pre-MPP compared to other groups. In a study conducted on premenopausal women, low bone mineral density (BMD) values were associated with elevated serum levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor- (NF-) kappaB (receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF ) kappaB (RANK)), in the group of coeliac patients compared to controls, despite the normal values of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) [24]. Furthermore, in a case report, autoantibodies against osteoprotegerin (osteoprotegerin (OPG)), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that inhibits receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF ) kappaB (RANK), were found in a man with coeliac disease and severe osteoporosis not reversible with gluten free diet (GFD) [59]. However, Larussa and coworkers [60] did not find circulating antibodies against osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the serum of 30 celiac patients, regardless of bone mineral density (BMD), duodenal histology, and HLA status.",dc6b5e9d-2a04-407d-a54d-77ef5e1f2987
17,methods17,"  Despite a recent guideline suggested that vit. D levels should be measured at diagnosis and that supplementation with calcium and vit. D should be provided according to its level [58], only half of the subjects furnished reports of vit. D analysis and the majority after gluten free diet (GFD) (Figure 2(a)). Although only 13% of cases had severe D-hypovitaminosis (Table 3), there is a consensus that levels lower than 20 ng/ml are associated with osteoporosis and the Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend to maintain vit. D levels above 30 ng/ml in subjects with malabsorption syndrome, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and under osteoporosis treatment [53].  In the NU-AGE study, conducted in elderly people, a Med diet with a vit. D supplement (1 year) reduced the rate of bone loss in individuals with osteoporosis [61] but increased the TLR-stimulated ex vivo expression of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 in women with a body mass index (BMI) < 31.",01a97653-f0f9-489c-a5c4-c87198420520
18,methods18," The authors suggested that this gender-effect may be related to the fact that women exhibit stronger cellular- and humoral-mediated immune responses compared to men, with a higher risk of autoimmune disease [62].  Overlap exists between coeliac disease and other gut disorders, such as fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs), and lactose intolerance [63]. However, in our study, subjects who declared lactose intolerance also declared to consume lactose-free milk. Moreover, all subjects, according to the selection criteria, had anti-Tg (Table 2) at diagnosis, and decreases in anti-Tg were always observed after gluten free diet (GFD), as well as negativization of antiendomysial and antigliadin antibodies. Concerning FODMAP, a recent retrospective study [64] reported that coeliac disease patients, despite the low intake of gluten-free cereals high in FODMAP, consumed a significant amount of fruits and vegetables high in FODMAP.",741e3a02-43dd-4f20-9b22-0b06a8096a01
19,methods19," Therefore, the authors suggested that a low-FODMAP diet should be a supportive therapy in subjects at gluten free diet (GFD). In agreement, a recent randomized clinical trial (RCT) [65] reported that in subjects on gluten free diet (GFD) with persistence of functional gastrointestinal disorders, a diet low in FODMAP reduced abdominal pain and improved the fecal consistency.  In our study, only Pre-M had higher MDS-7CO % self 14 and MDS-1F self 14, compared to Men and Post-M (Table 8), despite only in Pre-PP recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) mean was over the cut off levels (Table 5).  However, overall recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was correlated with Score-55, Score-60 (including Score-5RC), Score-30CO (high consumption of olive oil, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and fish and low consumption of red meat), and Score-5UC (and its % self 55 and self 60) (Table 7).",256dab1f-695c-44e2-b58c-a1e3ac78bfc9
20,methods20," Looking to the differences in other dietary habits, the Pre-MPP group presented lower percentages of subjects with EHO-B and of chocolate consumers; the two factors for which an interaction with the relationship was found (Table 6). On the one hand, these differences can affect the dissimilarities in recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (Table 5) but, on the other hand, they must be taken into account when evaluating the two-way analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with dietary habits and cut off as factors (Table 6). Keeping in mind these considerations, interesting chocolate consumption was associated with lower recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) regardless the cut off level (Table 6).  In this context, in a randomized double-blind crossover study [66] in overweight men (age 45-70 yr), after 4 weeks of consumption, delta lymphocytes' count versus baseline levels were −0.05 ± 0.19 and −0.03 ± 0.",f5b6c1c2-f1b1-4315-b653-a613e30ebc7a
21,methods21,"2 n/nl for high flavanol chocolate (HFC: 70 g contained 1078 mg flavanols, of which 349 mg epicatechins) and normal flavanol chocolate (NFC: 70 g contained 259 mg flavanols, of which 97 mg epicatechins), respectively. Delta neutrophils' count versus baseline levels were −0.30 ± 0.70 and −0.0 ± 0.8 n/nl for NFC and HFC, with no differences between treatments.  Our study presents some limitations such as the small number of subjects enrolled and the absence of complete data in some cases (in particular for vit. D levels), due to the retrospective nature of the study. Moreover, due to the high percentage of nonclassified histological evaluations (n.c., Table 2), we cannot observe the previously reported correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and Marsh stage at diagnosis [48]. However, the major limitation of our study is that no data were available concerning anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (anti Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA)).",d18001bd-21ce-4b49-8f83-b7a1908e1314
22,methods22," It has been suggested that the high prevalence of anti Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) in coeliac disease may be the effect of a nonspecific immune response in the course of chronic small bowel disease [67], and it has been reported that serum levels of anti Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) correlated with the grade of mucosal morphology, as the anti Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) serum levels declined in accordance with mucosal healing [68]. anti Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) (immunoglobulin G and/or immunoglobulin A) were frequently observed during active coeliac disease and decreased after gluten free diet (GFD) [68–71], but more in children than in adults [70–72], who resulted more frequently anti Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) positive at diagnosis [71, 72].",92cd5aee-6bf9-439e-8f62-7ec78f96529f
23,methods23," After successful adherence to a gluten free diet (GFD) and normalization of anti-Tg 29% of adults remained anti Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) positive, 7% of whom remained positive for both IgA and IgG anti Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) [71]. It has been suggested that this finding can be explained by the well-known fact that gut permeability normalizes much better in children than in adults [71]. Significantly higher faecal counts of Saccharomyces were found in patients reporting persistent symptoms, despite the gluten free diet (GFD), compared to noncoeliac controls [73].",511ddb92-d0f5-4d38-95e5-bdc98c6e8ee1
24,methods24," Although further studies are needed in order to investigate the relationship between Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) levels over the cut off and anti Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), in the present study, no interactions were found between eating out of home (EOH)-P and Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) cut off by two-way analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Table 6). Moreover, recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was correlated with UC (Table 7), but not RC, consumption.  5. Conclusion In this pilot study, we have investigated for the first time the relationship between Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), dietary habit, and osteoporosis in coeliac disease.",beb85566-7179-49f8-b940-883cdbfdad52
25,methods25," Although recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was higher in subjects with osteoporosis compared to osteopenia and normal bone mineral density (BMD), retrospective analysis showed both increase and decrease in Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) after gluten free diet (GFD), with no significant differences between Marsh grade, anemia, and bone mineral density (BMD) status. Refined cereal consumption was correlated with recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). However, despite no data were available concerning anti Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), due to the retrospective nature of our study, in the present study, no relationships were found between eating out of home at pizzeria or gluten-free refined cereal consumption and Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). On the other hand, recent Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was correlated with Score-55, including the consumption of UC, but not with MDS-14.",083c4783-f58f-4d9f-ab8d-4c297a845a83
26,methods26,"  In conclusion, more prospective studies are needed in order to clarify the relationship between UC and Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in coeliac patients since coeliac patients are generally encouraged to rise intakes of dietary fibre through the increase in the consumption of whole-grain and enriched/fortified gluten-free flours, breads, pasta, and cereals whenever possible.
