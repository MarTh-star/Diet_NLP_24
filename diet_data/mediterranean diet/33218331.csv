In particular, the adherence to the MD, Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI), and Fatty liver Index (FLI) were the factors that exerted the most powerful influence on the presence of the Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO)-polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotype.

On this basis, we suggested the usefulness of adjunctive diagnostic parameters to better differentiate the Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO)/Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO) phenotypes in this cohort of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with obesity.  The distinction between Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO) and Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) have been introduced to define individuals with obesity in whom cardio-metabolic risk factors are absent or present, respectively.",21299382-8c9d-4c86-be26-b44980a189ac
20,methods20," Currently, the most used criteria to define Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO) are based on the presence of ≤2 of the four diagnostic criteria for MetS according to the NCEP ATP III definition [11]. Nevertheless, a growing body of evidence indicated that Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO) individuals are not ‘healthy’, as they are at higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, hearth failure, and respiratory diseases and some cancers compared with non-obese individuals with a normal metabolic profile [57,58]. Therefore, the inclusion of adjunctive criteria, such as insulin resistance and hs-CRP have been proposed to better characterize the different metabolic risk profile between Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO)/Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) phenotypes, either in individuals with obesity [7,9,10] or in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients [6,18].",e4ccc5ad-bd62-4637-aca4-2f2a4014f533
21,methods21," In addition, differences in dietary pattern, such as adherence to the MD [14], and body composition [15], have been reported to further influence the metabolic risk profile of the two obesity phenotypes. Nevertheless, the association of the metabolic risk profile of Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO)/Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) with the nutritional status and cardio-metabolic indices in adult polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with obesity has not been investigated previously.  Our findings on the differences in metabolic risk profile of Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO)/Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) phenotypes in adult women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are line with the study of Kim JY et al.

Also, Mu L et al. (2018) [19] more recently investigated the metabolic risk profile in a very large survey of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women of reproductive age and found that Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO)-polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) group had worse metabolic and endocrine profile as compared with the Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO)-polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) group [19].",442a2973-a819-4d1e-81f9-f3a8e0772e50
23,methods23," In this study, however, the Authors found no significant difference in body mass index (BMI) between the two groups of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with obesity, but their body mass index (BMI) values were lower than those in our population sample and [19]. In addition, in neither of these two studies the nutritional status and cardio-metabolic indices were included to characterize the metabolic risk profile of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO) and Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO).  Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) and Fatty liver Index (FLI) are two cardio-metabolic indices linked to the inflammatory pathways and early predictors of MetS [59,60,61]. In particular, Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) is an index based on a combination of anthropometric and metabolic parameters that is highly correlated with visceral adiposity measured by magnetic resonance imaging and expression of dysfunctional adipocytes [62].",d9b659c9-b72e-4a79-825b-cf9246d41841
24,methods24," Fatty liver Index (FLI) is a well-established non-invasive composite proxy to assess liver steatosis [47]. Both Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) and Fatty liver Index (FLI) have well demonstrated to represent predictive markers of the prognosis not only among Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO) subjects [12,13], but also in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women with obesity [59,60,61]. More specifically, de Medeiros SF [63] found that Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) was the strongest predictor of MetS in both obese and non-obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women, suggesting its usefulness in clinical practice to detect the risk for MetS and to early address adequate therapeutical interventions in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), particularly in women with obesity. However, in this study the Authors did not distinguish polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women with obesity according to Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO)/Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) phenotypes.",93555317-b70f-46c4-bacc-672d1405fbfc

In that, our findings suggested a possible use of Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) as distinctive marker of Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) presence among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Of interest, we have previously reported that higher levels of liver/spleen index were significantly associated with the low-grade chronic inflammation in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women with high plasma levels of bisphenol A, one of the most common endocrine disruptors involved in the obesity pathogenesis and the alterations of several metabolic functions, including inflammatory pathways [64].",8ed8bd06-6715-4bb0-8850-0c73da953627
28,methods28,"  There is a general consensus that lifestyle modifications for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), including physical activity and diet, are currently the mainstay to improve the metabolic deregulation related to this condition [65,66,67]. In particular, it is well established that the MD exerts beneficial effects on inflammation hyperandrogenism and cardiometabolic risk profile in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). MD, characterized by high consumption of extra virgin olive oil, fish, vegetables, legumes, whole-grain products, fruits, and nuts, has been demonstrated to exert relevant anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects on different clinical settings, including inflammatory and immune processes [68], psoriasis [69], acne [70], hidradenitis suppurativa [71], breast cancer [72,73], endocrine dysfunction [74,75], sleep disturbance [76,77], or menopause [78,79].",683e4461-5ceb-408c-b5e9-c71660768593
29,methods29," In particular, MD provides a significant source of antioxidant vitamins thus decrease inflammation and oxidative stress [80]. Park YM (2016) reported the differential beneficial association of MD on mortality risk reduction in Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO) and not in Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) phenotype in individuals with obesity [14]. We previously reported that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women had lower adherence to the MD as compared with body mass index (BMI)-matched controls, with an inverse association among the adherence to MD, body mass index (BMI), and the clinical severity of the disease [81]. Accordingly, Cutillas-Tolín A et al. (2021) [82] found that the women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and a higher adherence scores to the MD had a lower body mass index (BMI).",d94fd754-458b-4e60-b31f-9d6b736fe2e7

As novel finding, we evidenced that the adherence to the MD was also different in Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO)/Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) phenotypes, being a PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score ≤4 the best predictor of the Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) presence. In addition, in line with the well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of the MD [80] we found that the Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO)-polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with a low adherence to the MD presented also high hs-CPR levels and small PhAs, two distinctive markers of inflammation in this study.",5d0cb32f-a6e0-4f31-a13c-d6380364730d
31,methods31," CRP, a commonly used biomarker of meta-inflammation [83], has recently been included among criteria to define the obesity phenotypes [10]. PhA, a non-invasive bioimpedance marker, reflects cell membrane integrity and size, and it is used as a marker of body cell mass [84]. Altered measurements of the PhA are associated with inflammatory markers [85], are commonly used in the nutritional screening of several diseases, are an important independent predictor of mortality [86], and might represent an easy detectable marker of inflammation that avoid the collection of blood sampling and expensive biochemical assays [87]. Correlations have been found between increased levels of CRP and other markers of inflammation in the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women compared with age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls [1].",f3b77c6d-7721-444c-b5e2-492b9a0232c8
32,methods32," Nevertheless, when CRP levels were analysed considering the Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO)/Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotype in the previously cited study by Liang P, no differences were found between the two groups [20].  As possible translational applications, in line with the current literature, our study suggested that the adherence to the MD, the determination of the PhA, as easy detectable marker of inflammation, and Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) and Fatty liver Index (FLI), as early predictors of the MetS, should be considered as adjunctive criteria in the characterization of the metabolic risk profile in Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO)/Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO)-polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes.",72f8bc0d-b3df-4417-95c1-ad157c8a52d3
33,methods33," In particular, by using the PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score, which is a short, valid and easy questionnaire, a cut-off value score ≤4 could serve as predictor of the risk of Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO)-to-Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) conversion among polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with obesity in the clinical practice. The association of the low adherence to the MD with worse endocrine and metabolic profiles in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with obesity let us to speculate that the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of the MD, through the improvements in the hyperandrogenism, cardio-metabolic indices, and pro-inflammatory status, could act as synergistic mechanism to prevent Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO)-to-Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) conversion among polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with obesity.  Limitations of this study warrant some considerations.",b90d725f-04b7-4f53-8cc0-522d8a91922a
34,methods34," First, the cross-sectional design of this study does not allow for causal inference and prospective on the role of the adherence to the MD in the prediction of the Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) phenotype in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. Therefore, the proposed cut-off point of PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score for identifying the Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) phenotype should be validated by further clinical trials. Second, the sample size is relatively small. However, the sample size was calculated by using 95% statistical power that assured an adequate power to detect statistical significance on the results. Third, we did not analyse other inflammatory markers. Nevertheless, it is widely reported that CRP represents the most studied inflammatory biomarker in different pathologic processes [88]. In addition, we used hs-CRP method, which allows an acceptable precision level of <0.2 mg/L.",0be21a7f-da67-48a7-a16b-242df7e301b4
35,methods35,"  Nevertheless, this study also has several strengths. First, the accurate characterization of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) study population by a trained team of Endocrinologists and Nutritionists. In particular, to increase the homogeneity of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) sample, all polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients included were only naïve to treatment and came from the same geographical area, thus possibly sharing overall similar eating habits and food availability. Second, to further minimize the inter-operator variability, a single nutritionist performed and interpreted bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-parameters and evaluated the adherence to the MD and the total energy intake of both Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO) and Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients.",da2927e2-2bcd-4c23-b504-24e114d69666
36,methods36," In particular, either adherence to the MD evaluated by PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) questionnaire, which was recently validated in different Mediterranean countries, including Italy [89], or the total energy intake evaluated by the seven-day food record, the gold standard among food frequency questionnaire, were not self-reported, but face-to-face administered, to reduce any bias related to the filling in of these questionnaires.  5. Conclusions  The adherence to the MD, which can be evaluated by a short, valid and easy questionnaire, represented the major determinant of the Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO) phenotype in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. The results of this study underline the importance of assessment of the nutritional status to better address polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with obesity to a personalized, intensive weight-loss program.",661d6153-ce51-4adc-9971-8721e6702ae6
37,methods37, Growing cooperation between Endocrinologists and Nutritionists confirmed to be the better synergistic combination in the complex clinical management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with obesity. ,eba3615e-975a-49c4-8fc2-d8c96546d03c
