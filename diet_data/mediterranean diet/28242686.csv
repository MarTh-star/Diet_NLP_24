0,introduction0,"Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP)) is a distinct macular disease characterized by a bilateral and symmetric extensive geographic atrophy involving the posterior pole without foveal sparing (Fig. 1)1. The macular atrophy is systematically associated with diffuse pseudodrusen lining the entire posterior pole and the midperiphery. Pseudodrusen (Pseudodrusen (PSD)) and macular atrophy are also encountered in age-related macular degeneration (Age related Macular Disease (AMD), Fig. 2), the most frequent macular disease occurring after the age of 60 years in high-incomes countries. In Age related Macular Disease (AMD), these lesions occur at late stages in the seventh to eighth decades of life2–5. By contrast, in Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) these common elementary lesions are noted at the beginning of the disease in the fifth decade.",69306303-b784-4319-8694-aefd48da780f
1,introduction1," Night blindness is a systematic inaugural clinical sign of Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP), rarely reported in Age related Macular Disease (AMD). In addition, Age related Macular Disease (AMD) is a perifoveopathy with a slow rate of progression and long term foveal preservation. By contrast, Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) atrophy is strikingly rapidly progressing throughout the entire posterior pole with a larger vertical axis and a lack of foveal preservation. Furthermore, the majority of Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) patients also present with paving stone lesions in the far peripheral retina (Fig. 1). Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) also shares the pseudodrusen lesions and a fast progression of the atrophy with diffuse trickling geographic atrophy (diffuse trickling geographic atrophy (DTGA)), an early and severe form of Age related Macular Disease (AMD).",43558b17-223d-411f-919a-1d68c6c0afe0

In Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP), macular atrophy is extensive with a larger vertical axis passing over the optic nerve head (white arrow) to reach the nasal part of the peripapillary retina (A). The atrophy is dark, well-delineated on autofluorescence photograph (B). In Age related Macular Disease (AMD), there are several patches of macular atrophy restricted to the macular zone (C) surrounded by pseudodrusen and classic Age related Macular Disease (AMD) drusen. On FAF, the atrophic patches are dark and surrounded by mild hyperautofluorescent Age related Macular Disease (AMD) drusen (D, white arrows).",cb807d97-a257-44d7-8892-0aaf7e55a408

Pseudodrusen (PSD) reproduce interlacing yellowish lesions enhanced by blue light. In Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP), Pseudodrusen (PSD) are noted throughout the macular area and the whole peripheral retina, whereas in Age related Macular Disease (AMD), they are mainly restricted to the macular zone. On spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), Pseudodrusen (PSD) are not located beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)) like classic Age related Macular Disease (AMD) drusen, but in the subretinal space at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) or between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the photoreceptors.",4256f7d0-bf01-4fef-8889-494d4dc29258

6,introduction6,"    We undertook a large national clinical case-control study to identify Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) risk factors and to compare them with those of late atrophic Age related Macular Disease (AMD) with or without pseudodrusen. We previously highlighted an inflammatory mechanism underlying Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) reflected by abnormal total hemolytic complement (CH50) and complement component 3 (C3) serum levels, and eosinophilia9. By contrast, systemic Age related Macular Disease (AMD) risk factors such as blood pressure, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) and cholesterol, were not detected9. This first study also excluded a role for medications with toxic retinal effects. Herein, we focus on dietary, environmental, and genetic risk factors associated with Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP), as well as geographic distribution of cases.

In Age related Macular Disease (AMD), fungicides may increase the risk of retinal degeneration based on the Agricultural Health Study of farm families from Iowa and North Carolina (1993–1997)18,19. The role of long-term/low-dose exposure to pesticides (organophosphates, paraquat) is well documented in Parkinson disease, which is the consequence of a degeneration preferentially affecting the dopamine-synthesizing neurons of the nigrostriatal neuronal pathway20–23. Even if the molecular mechanisms of the neuronal degeneration are not completely identified, most pesticides produce oxidative or endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial alterations, and finally neuronal cell loss.",516f236a-1e50-4d39-8f67-3a3d642a045c
18,discussion1," Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) may share a toxic predominant neuronal degeneration with Parkinson disease. The Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP)-associated neuronal degeneration could involve rods, cones or both. Despite a systematic inaugural night blindness, electroretinogram (electroretinogram (ERG)) studies did not suggest a major rod cell death but a rod dysfunction. Rod responses are notably reduced after a 20 minute-dark adaptation time (International Society for Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) protocol), but dramatically recover after a 120 minute prolonged dark adaptation (Fig. 5). This rod-impairment could be induced by the pseudodrusen i.e. diffuse subretinal deposits located between the retinal pigment epithelium and the inner and outer segments of the photoreceptors.",655dc698-d148-40d2-9844-d67c021e77d5
19,discussion2," Systematic and severe decrease of photopic single flash and flicker electroretinogram (ERG) responses as noted in Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) patients (Fig. 5), and not in Age related Macular Disease (AMD), suggests that cone degeneration is part of the Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) process. In human and monkey retinas, cone density increased from a 7 mm (35°) of eccentricity line (20 000 cones/mm2) to the fovea peak cone (150 000 cones/mm2). This cone distribution correlates with the pattern and extent of Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) macular atrophy and 25–35° central scotoma. In addition, Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) atrophic paving stone lesions developed in the far periphery of the retina, which is a cone-enriched rim deprived of rods that begins 13 mm from the fovea and peaks at 1 mm from the ora serrata24,25.",09c087f0-b839-4397-a4e3-dcc7a2af4313

Mediterranean diet and consumption of virgin olive oil reduce the incidence of chronic or neuro-degenerative diseases. Virgin olive oil phenolics have positive effects on antioxidant status, antimicrobial activity and on inflammation as they are natural nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs.

In addition, all subjects completed a 25-item chemical exposure questionnaire relative to chemicals used in professional and in non-professional activities. Chemical exposures were recorded across “Yes/No” questions and frequency levels from “once a day” to “few times a year”. In addition, participants had to indicate the names of the products used (brand, type).",1a15fefd-6e7a-4eb2-ac9f-53703372f1b8
31,discussion15,"  Environmental factors and Geographic incidence All Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) patients gave information on their birthplace and their subsequent residencies until inclusion to assess the lifelong environmental exposure (farming and industrialized areas). To avoid any bias associated with recruitment centers, we evaluated the incidence of Extended Macular Atrophy with Pseudodrusen (EMAP) by place of birth and childhood residency, and normalized to the number of inhabitants reported in 1950 (corresponding to the birth peak).
