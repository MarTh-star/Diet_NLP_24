0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design and Participants Twenty-eight consecutive pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women attending the Diabetes and Metabolism Unit and the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinic, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, “G. d'Annunzio” University of Chieti-Hospital “SS Annunziata” of Chieti, were recruited. Socio-demographic characteristics and clinical parameters, such as blood glucose, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, and blood pressure, were collected. BMI was measured at the beginning (BMI 1) and at the end of pregnancy (BMI 2). A blood sample was obtained from each patient and nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 9 genes related to nutrients and metabolism were included in the analysis.  All 28 women attended a 3-year-postpartum follow-up. Postpartum glucose tolerance (75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) was assessed. Clinical parameters were collected in all subjects.",50daf434-91d6-42b8-9a64-03ac02c67c6b
1,methods1," Cardiovascular and metabolic markers were analyzed, including total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels; TG; homocysteine; and carotid artery intima media thickness (IMT). In addition, HbA1C and fasting blood glucose were measured.  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) was evaluated through a validated 14-item questionnaire (PREDIMED), which generates a range of possible scores namely (i) no adherence (score ≤ 5), (ii) medium adherence (6 ≤ score ≤ 9), and (iii) maximum adherence (score ≥ 10) [24]. In addition, physical activity (PA) was assessed using a short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)), comprising 7 items concerning PA, 4 relating to demographic information, and the remaining 6 about the comprehension of the questionnaire [25]. International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) registers three different levels of intensity (low, moderate, and high PA).",b6a3a17c-f140-4f6c-9296-bb20cdfd8f9d
2,methods2,"  All participants gave their written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the “G. d'Annunzio” University, Chieti-Pescara, Italy.  2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The inclusion criteria admitted women with ≥18 years of age with pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosis was confirmed when established both at the 16–18th and the 24–28th weeks of gestation, according to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG)) criteria [26].  The exclusion criteria were women with type 1 or 2 prepregnancy diabetes, overt diabetes, or monogenic diabetes, specifically GCK diabetes.  2.3. Gene and SNP Selection The genetic analysis was conducted at the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, “G. d'Annunzio” University of Chieti.",2cd18556-8fda-4eb5-bb79-aac96e28ce77
3,methods3," A total of 9 SNPs previously associated in literature with obesity, lipid, and glucose metabolism were selected. These SNPs, on different loci, have been associated with cardiovascular disease in previous studies, under the assumption that these variants may also contribute to cardiovascular risk assessment [22, 23].  In particular, three of these variants, namely, rs7903146 (C > T) in TCF7L2, rs1801282 (C > G) in PPARG2, and rs8192678 (C > T) in PPARGC1A are involved in carbohydrate metabolism; other three, namely, rs662799 (T > C) in APOA5, rs2228671 (C > T) in low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and rs1260326 (C > T) in GCKR are involved in fat metabolism. In addition, two other SNPs, rs9939609 (T > A) in FTO and rs17782313 (T > C) near MC4R, associated with hunger control, were also selected. Finally, rs1801133 (C > T) in MTHFR, involved in folate metabolism, was also genotyped.",71cc9d22-1c83-4908-a5c4-42adca0c9fe3
4,methods4," It is of great relevance that all the selected gene variants make up a panel of cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers, which could provide a unique opportunity to use genetic information in clinical practice to predict early cardiovascular disease (CVD) in pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women [22, 23].  All SNPs were genotyped by High Resolution Melting (High Resolution Melting (HRM)) analysis. High Resolution Melting (HRM) was performed on 96-well PikoReal Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Scientific™) using the Luminaris Color High Resolution Melting (HRM) Master Mix (Thermo Scientific™) according to the manufacturer's instructions, as previously described [22].  2.4. Carotid Intima-Media Thickness Assessment Carotid intima-media thickness (cintima media thickness (IMT)) was assessed in the Institute of Cardiology, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, “G. d'Annunzio” University of Chieti.",cdae9b3a-8262-4820-aabc-df8377c15601
5,methods5,"  Left and right intima-media thickness (intima media thickness (IMT)) was measured on common carotid posterior wall, 1 centimeter from bulb bifurcation on each side, according to the latest European Society of Cardiology (European Society of Cardiology (ESC)) and European Society of Hypertension (European Society of Hypertension (ESH)) guidelines [27].  All the exams were performed with a dedicated Esaote MyLab 30 Gold portable ultrasound, with a standard 7.5 MHz linear probe, provided with Quality Intima Media Thickness (Qintima media thickness (IMT)™) software. The software uses radio frequency data processing signal in real time and ensures high accuracy and low intra- and interobserver variability [28]. One expert operator (FB) performed all the exams in a blinded fashion from genetics; before the automatic measurement of Qintima media thickness (IMT), a manual image acquisition of carotid vessels was obtained with each participant lying supine, with the neck hyperextended.",746591c8-5220-4439-a3b9-d8a0c4de4750
6,methods6," At each patient was attributed the mean value between three measurements for Qintima media thickness (IMT). Concordance correlation coefficient between the three measurements was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-0.99).  2.5. Statistical Analysis We estimated the minimum required sample size for the correlation analysis on the basis of previously observed data or published results. The minimum sample size (n = 28) was determined in order to obtain an expected correlation coefficient (r = 0.5) [20] between cintima media thickness (IMT) and lipid profile parameters with at least 80% of desired statistical power level and an alpha error rate of 5%.  The quantitative variables were summarized as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)), according to their distribution. Qualitative variables were summarized as frequency and percentage. Shapiro-Wilk's test was performed to evaluate the departures from normality distribution for each variable.",e07966e6-dc4f-49d9-b5d7-cb2f4db1d98e
7,methods7,"  Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (concordance correlation coefficient (CCC)) was calculated along with the 95% confidence intervals of assessing the intraobserver reproducibility of measurements.  Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to test the effect of different APOA5 genotypes on levels of cintima media thickness (IMT) and on levels of TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG.  The relationship between cintima media thickness (IMT) and TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG at the 3rd trimester was explored by linear multiple regression analysis adjusted for age and BMI. The univariate regressions between cintima media thickness (IMT) and lipid profile at the 3rd trimester of pregnancy were reported graphically as a scattergram.  Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)) deviations in the genotype frequency distributions were calculated using the chi-square analysis.  The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.",c8235e30-c844-4a89-8613-6bf8eab85176
8,methods8," Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS)) software for Windows (Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS), Chicago, IL, USA) and Stata v14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).  3. Results The demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort of women, both during pregnancy and at follow-up, are reported in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. A total of 28 women were included in the study. No difference has been found in the adherence to the MedDiet, PA, and smoking among the sample.  Although not statistically significant, an inverse correlation between the PREDIMED and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scores with the cintima media thickness (IMT) values was found (Rho = −0.060, p = 0.768 and Rho = −0.276, p = 0.163, respectively). In addition, our results showed a connection between the women's waist circumference and cintima media thickness (IMT) values (Rho = 0.",30532aca-1dfb-4ec6-a6e8-291e37febb82
9,methods9,"378, p = 0.057) at the follow-up, which, however, does not reach a statistical significance.  Furthermore, a significant positive relation between the 3rd trimester TG and cintima media thickness (IMT) (Rho = 0.468; p = 0.014) was found (Figure 1). The genotype distribution of investigated SNPs in patients is reported in Table 3. All the investigated genotype frequencies were within the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium range (χ2 test p value > 0.05). Also, a significant association was found in the codominant model (TT vs. TC vs. CC) between APOA5 CC genotype and cintima media thickness (IMT) after adjustments for age and BMI (0.50 ± 0.07 vs 0.48 ± 0.08 vs 0.65 ± 0.08; p = 0.045) (Figure 2). Finally, a significant association between the interaction CC APOA5/CC low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and cintima media thickness (IMT) (p = 0.010) has been observed.",dd667061-8224-4c47-9c53-668af15eb17d
10,methods10,"  No statistically significant differences were found among the 3rd trimester lipid profile, PREDIMED, and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scores in different APOA5 genotypes.  No other significant differences were detected with respect to other genes.  4. Discussion The main aim of the present study was to assess the joint predictive role of lipid profile during pregnancy and of some genetic variants, cintima media thickness (IMT) taken as a parameter of subclinical atherosclerosis, and indicating an early susceptibility to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a cohort of women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) history. Another aim was to examine new nutrigenetic markers as well as traditional parameters to predict early subclinical atherosclerosis in pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to plan adequate early prevention interventions.",6348b5ba-8e5d-43be-ba6e-5036114f5fa2
11,methods11,"  Several routine parameters and biochemical markers are currently available to quantify the risk in pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women to develop diabetes after pregnancy [3]. Although the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in young women is low, an early identification of possible cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk may provide an irreplaceable opportunity for well-timed intervention and timely prevention. In order to reduce not only the occurrence of diabetes but also its subsequent cardiovascular complications, it is necessary to improve the provision of postpartum follow-ups. In fact, many authors have highlighted the close relationship between common cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and a Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) history. In addition to traditional parameters, cintima media thickness (IMT) and arterial stiffness (RFQAS) values can be significant in assessing the risk for heart disease and strokes [18]. Bo et al.",07a5cc1a-5599-4bfc-8d11-eb77fe83a6a3
12,methods12," [20] measured cintima media thickness (IMT) in 82 women with a history of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 113 without one, 6.5 years after delivery: their study showed that women with pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), regardless of their BMI and the presence of metabolic abnormalities, displayed remarkably higher E-selectin, ICAM-1, and intima media thickness (IMT) values than controls. intima media thickness (IMT) proved to be significantly associated with pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a regression model, after adjustments for BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, and glucose values. Volpe et al. [21] measured cintima media thickness (IMT) in 28 women with and 24 without a history of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) 2 years after delivery, finding that young women with pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) presented early signs of vessel involvement, albeit within upper normal levels.",671ffc37-8168-4f6f-884f-85cc02cbe190
13,methods13," Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and control groups differed in terms of their main metabolic syndrome components, such as waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and TG, all significantly higher in Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women than in the control group.  Kaul et al. [29] observed that Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was associated with 1.4 times higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Then, Retnakaran and Shah [11] confirmed similar results, noting that women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have an elevated risk of bad cardiovascular outcomes, even in the absence of type 2 diabetes.  Hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C are known to be characteristic traits of type 2 diabetes. It may not be surprising that in our previous studies their presence was detected in women with pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).",97abccdc-543e-4367-833c-e605916c5c66
14,methods14," Although the CV risk implications of hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C remain controversial, the CV significance of LDL-C and its main lipoprotein (apolipoprotein B (apoB)) is well established [30]. In our previous studies, Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women showed significantly higher serum concentrations of TC and LDL-C during the 3rd trimester than the control group, and a significant correlation was observed between lipid parameters and some polymorphisms in genes APOA5 and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR); also, TG were higher in Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women than controls, although not reaching statistical significance [23]. Interestingly, in our present study, an association between 3rd trimester TG and cintima media thickness (IMT) has been found (p = 0.014).  These remarkable results echo those of Di Cianni et al.",77172352-b373-43ce-9131-8c95409a1fd5
15,methods15," [31], who reported that TC, TG, LDL-C, glucose, and systolic blood pressure were all significantly higher among the Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) cohort, suggesting a condition similar to the metabolic syndrome occurring in these women. These peculiar changes in lipoprotein profile may favour endothelial damage in pregnancy [32, 33]. The Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) lipid profile is very similar to the one accompanying the insulin resistance in the metabolic syndrome. More recently, Gongora and Wenger [34] showed that women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a more atherogenic lipid profile by three months postpartum, characterized by an increase of cintima media thickness (IMT) compared to controls and that the risk of developing metabolic syndrome increased by up to 10% in those with pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).",76a48e7b-c1e5-4415-821f-ab2ca30654b2
16,methods16,"  It is known that pregnancy is a stress test, as hyperglycemia seems to have a significant impact on the CV system during this limited period [35]; we could hypothesize that lipid pattern modifications during pregnancy with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are an injury which results in a possible susceptibility to future cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Unfortunately, the mechanisms involved in an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) need to be further investigated. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women's lipid profile displays a preponderance of small dense LDL particles; also, they present an increased susceptibility of LDL oxidation during pregnancy [30].  These data reveal the necessity of monitoring women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) adequately and long term, to prevent both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes risks.",a0b89dfb-7974-44b5-bca2-660d83609dcc
17,methods17," Unfortunately, several studies showed low rates of postdelivery glucose testing [36, 37]. It should be emphasised that, to date, the postpartum screening of women with pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is still suboptimal [3]; therefore, this issue also prompts the need to identify a practical and feasible tool which ideally should include panel genes and routine clinical and metabolic parameters, to identify Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women at high risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [23] and summon them for follow-ups. Previous investigations highlighted that women with pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life as a result of a combination of genetic factors and gene-diet interaction.  Furthermore, it is essential to define the characteristics of the studied gene variants.",412a70dd-0f2e-4bd4-a600-525047f64ecf
18,methods18," Interestingly, a previous Italian study showed that APOA5-1131T > C may affect the risk of early-onset myocardial infarction (MI), with an odds ratio of 1.44 (CI: 1.23–1.69) per C allele [38]. Apolipoprotein A-V gene, as described for the first time in 2001, is located proximal to the APOAI, APOCIII, and APOA-IV gene cluster on human 11q23 [39]. APOA5 encodes apolipoprotein (apo) AV, which is expressed in the liver and circulates on chylomicrons (CM), very low density lipoproteins (very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)), and HDL. Common genetic variants of the apolipoprotein gene family members are related to variations in serum lipid levels.  Recently, a meta-analysis [40] showed that the APOA5 rs662799 C allele is associated with elevated circulating TG levels, regardless of ethnicity, indicating a possible mediating role for circulating TG in the association between the risk variant at APOA5 and the atherosclerotic process [41, 42].",3d917a50-1dc6-4c3d-9cef-71312e6aaf84
19,methods19," This variant was correlated with not only higher plasma TG but also with lower HDL-C levels by our [22, 23] and other groups [38, 43]. Emerging data about APOA5-1131T > C suggested that APOA5 gene may have a direct effect above and beyond its effect on TG but, until now, needs to be confirmed by further studies [38]. In the Framingham Heart Study, an almost 2-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was observed in females carrying the C allele of the −1131T > C [44]. Moreover, the relationship with intima media thickness (IMT) was observed for the rare allele of the −1131T > C SNP in overweight and obese subjects [45, 46].  Qiao et al. [47] observed that in type 2 diabetes patients, TG levels and the TG/HDL-C ratio were greater in those with TC and CC genotypes than in those with TT genotype subjects (p < 0.05). In addition, diabetic patients with CC genotype had greater carotid intima media thickness (IMT) than those with TT genotype (p = 0.",62e1a487-e1de-4ec0-8451-26f0c40c1e84
20,methods20,"080), although these data do not reach statistical significance.  We found a significant association between APOA5 CC genotype and cintima media thickness (IMT) (p = 0.045). Current evidence indicates that the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is influenced by a merging of modifiable risk factors, ages, and/or genetics; however, the proportion of the contribution of these factors in modulating is still debated. Our findings suggest that even though the age of our study cohort was very young, women with C genotype probably experience the disadvantage of such genetic factor leading to cardiovascular disease (CVD) susceptibility in the form of a cintima media thickness (IMT) increase.  low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene can regulate cholesterol metabolism.",33d2153b-f140-492a-a894-149387c88243
21,methods21," Among the several genetic variants identified at low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) locus, the rs2228671 has been intensively studied and it has shown the strongest association with total and LDL-C levels across multiple populations [48–50] with the T allele being associated consistently, to a decreased risk of CAD [48]. Our previous findings are consistent with the previous literature; in fact, we showed that carriers of the rs2228671 T allele were significantly associated with the 3rd trimester LDL-C levels in Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women [22, 23].  Furthermore, we observed a significant association between CC APOA5/CC low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) interaction and cintima media thickness (IMT) (p = 0.010). Surprisingly, women with CC genotype in APOA5 rs662799 in the absence of the T protective allele of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) rs2228671 present a cintima media thickness (IMT) increase.",6228bacc-a77f-40cb-a44a-53826d224afd
22,methods22," It would be interesting to further investigate the causal molecular mechanism underlying this interaction. We could hypothesize that the interaction effect of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) rs2228671 and APOA5 rs662799 implies a probable mitigation on cintima media thickness (IMT) values.  As expressed by Mecacci et al. [35], Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) can be considered as a “window into future health” in which it is advisable to adopt a healthy lifestyle to prevent or delay diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD) development postpartum.  In our previous study [23], we found that women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) had a greater BMI than the control group both in prepregnancy and at the end of pregnancy. In the present study, we analyzed women's lifestyle at follow-up: the pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women had a mean BMI that falls within the overweight range, as well as a high mean waist circumference (86.2 ± 16.1 cm).",2b11ba5c-4f7a-4db9-a330-8c3d03154d10
23,methods23," Moreover, no difference of adherence to the MedDiet, PA, and smoking was observed, although an inverse correlation between both the PREDIMED and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scores with the cintima media thickness (IMT) values was found. This is an interesting feature supporting the potential role of preventive intervention. In fact, we noted that our cohort had a median MedDiet score of 7.5 (medium adherence), suggesting a poor adherence to healthy nutritional habits; also, a high percentage of them reported lower levels of PA. These modifiable risk factors can be easily acted upon to allow for early cardiovascular prevention.  In this view, tailored nutrition and lifestyle prescription represent a promising strategy for the prevention and management of metabolic syndrome [51].",16b5e2aa-9b90-4100-ad46-0a2c39f81304
24,methods24," In this regard, the main goals are a correct identification and stratification of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and an evaluation of the preventive strategies, as well as the improvement of postpartum screening.  Longer-term studies are indicated to define a potential role of lifestyle intervention [4]. Follow-up after Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) could be enhanced by similar quality and accountability measures requiring that patients and clinicians discuss future risks and referral to primary care as a standard of practice [36].  To our knowledge, this is the first study using multisectoral innovative biomarkers to evaluate the cardiometabolic risk in pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).",7a5522f5-8d75-4938-be6a-151c09a5da44
25,methods25," Therefore, women with pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) could be enrolled in follow-up programs designed to ensure continuous monitoring, thus providing effective prevention of both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [7, 15].  It would be clinically valuable to have a risk marker during pregnancy so that long-term follow-ups and appropriate strategies of interventions can be focused on the women at greatest risk in a timely manner [52].  This study has some limitations. First of all, the sample size: this may have limited the statistical significance of metabolic and vascular function data. Second, non-pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women have not been involved.",9472f9ce-9d72-4273-a919-0f6890ee4565
26,methods26," The present research is a preliminary small-scale study to evaluate the joint predictive role of lipid profile during pregnancy and of some genetic variants on cintima media thickness (IMT) taken as a parameter of subclinical atherosclerosis in a cohort of women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) history. Results obtained about the potential role of routine biomarkers and nutrigenetic variants in our small sample could be validated in a larger study.  However, our study provides a remarkable insight into the potential predictive role of both genetic factors and 3rd trimester lipid profile for cardiovascular disease (CVD) susceptibility in pGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). It will be crucial to replicate and expand our findings and further studies are warranted for better understanding of the potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, thus attributing a significant prognostic role to new and old biomarkers during pregnancy.",2de007e5-1290-48c8-8f48-acdd9e89c23e
