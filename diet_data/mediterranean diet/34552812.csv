0,methods0," 2.1. Participants  Participants aged 20–80 years were derived from 2 ongoing studies (the Cognitive Reserve (CR) study and the Reference Ability Neural Network (Reference Ability Neural Network (RANN)) study), which were conducted at Columbia University Irving Medical Center [38,39]. Participants of these 2 studies were recruited with the same eligibility criteria, underwent similar research procedures, and had similar demographic characteristics. The initial eligibility of the participant selection included right-handed, English speaking, no psychiatric or neurological disorders, and normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Further, the eligible participants were scanned by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and completed socio-demographic information and food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)). In order to include only cognitively intact adults, those with a Dementia Rating Scale (Dementia Rating Scale (DRS)) score <130 were excluded.",43d42cc6-a876-4da6-ab92-73da5ffef956
1,methods1," More detailed information was provided in previous reports in our lab [39,40].  At baseline, 562 participants were enrolled in the 2 studies. As of January 2020, 255 participants returned for a follow-up visit after an average of 5 years from their baseline visit. One participant developed Multiple Sclerosis at the follow-up visit and was excluded. A total of 307 participants either dropped out or have not yet been seen for the follow-up visit. Among the 254 participants who completed both baseline and follow-up visits, we further excluded 49 participants lacking at least one measure of white matter hyperintensity (WMH), 19 missing diet data, 1 missing value of race/ethnicity, and 2 missing values of total grey matter volume. Hence, the current analyses included 183 cognitively intact adults (Figure 1). The baseline socio-demographic characteristics of the 183 participants were not different from those who were excluded (Table S1).",fce47030-2d25-4011-b07b-2cbd1196c059
2,methods2," The studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University (approval codes: AAAQ8249 and AAAI2752). All participants provided written informed consent.  2.2. Measures  MeDi score was calculated based on diet information obtained from Willett’s self-reported semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (Channing Laboratory, Cambridge, MA, USA), which includes 61 items in 11 food categories of Mediterranean dietary pattern and has been validated and widely used in the literature [41,42]. In a subset of the current study population, we performed a reproducibility analysis in 24 participants who completed 2 food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) reassessments on average 4.95 (standard deviation [SD] = 2.5) months apart.",81047e97-b5a1-4ca8-8424-0bea7d1796ad
3,methods3," Test-retest reliability for each of the 61 food items was calculated using single measure absolute agreement intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) based on 2-way mixed-effect analysis of variance with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The MeDi score showed good reliability and so did most of the food group components of MeDi score, suggesting the dietary assessment can reasonably represent the participants’ habitual dietary behaviors. For each food category, the frequency of consumption in servings per month was approximately estimated as the number of servings that this food category was consumed per month and then assigned scores 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. For the consumption of food categories with more characteristic of a Mediterranean dietary pattern (i.e., non-refined cereals, potatoes, fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, fish, and olive oil), a higher score corresponded to a more frequent intake.",f14822a3-189a-4572-baaa-aacaeb1f5939
4,methods4," For the consumption of food categories with less characteristic of a Mediterranean dietary pattern (i.e., poultry, red meat, and full-fat dairy products), the scores were assigned on a reverse scale, indicating that a higher score corresponded to a less frequent intake. For alcohol, a score of 5 was assigned for consumption of 1–2 servings per month; a score of 0 was assigned for consumption of more than 60 servings per month or for no consumption; scores 4 to 1 were assigned for consumption of 3–4, 5–14, 15–30, and 31–60 servings per month, respectively. Detailed information on scores for each food category is provided in Table S2. The total MeDi score was calculated as the sum of the scores in 11 food categories, ranging from 0–55 continuously, with a higher score indicating greater adherence [41]. MeDi scores were further classified into three groups, low, middle, and high adherence, based on tertiles of total MeDi scores.",4c62fc9d-c705-4a34-aacd-bdd302ec505a
5,methods5,"  All brain images were acquired on Philips Achieva 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)) scan was acquired with the following parameters: 11,000 msec repetition time, 2800 msec echo time, 256 × 189 voxels in-plane resolution, 23.0 × 17.96 cm field of view, and 30 slices with slice-thickness/gap of 4/0.5 mm and processed through a fully automatic supervised machine learning technique [43]. This method uses a randomized decision trees algorithm called random forest for training the classifier, which has been shown to be superior to the support vector machine algorithm often used for segmenting white matter hyperintensity (WMH). The final segmentation is a probability map in (0, 1), which denotes the likelihood that a given voxel is hyperintense, allowing for the calculation per subject of a normalized effective white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume.",459bb834-04d8-4a66-a027-f575390d3d83
6,methods6," Periventricular and deep hyperintensity accumulations are separated using a ventricular template. Processed white matter hyperintensity (WMH) images were visually checked and corrected if voxels were erroneously identified as white matter hyperintensity (WMH). A T1-weighted structural brain image was additionally acquired for each subject using MPRAGE sequence (TE/TR: 3/6.5 ms; Field of view: 256 mm; Flip angle: 8°; In-plane resolution: 256 × 256 voxels; Slice thickness/gap: 1/0 mm; Slices: 180). Both baseline and follow-up white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, baseline total grey matter volume (total grey matter volume (TGMV)), baseline intracranial volume (intracranial volume (ICV)), and baseline mean thickness were extracted from structural T1 scans after parcellation using FreeSurfer v5.1 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) (accessed on 30 August 2022) [36].",3db2512d-b1bf-4f91-a211-9d458ea6a8f8
7,methods7," In order to adjust for head size, total grey matter volume (TGMV) was regressed with intracranial volume (ICV), and the residuals of total grey matter volume (TGMV) were used in the analysis.  The outcome variable was five-year change in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden. Both baseline and follow-up white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes were log10(white matter hyperintensity (WMH)+1)-transformed, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change scores were calculated as follow-up log scores minus baseline log scores. According to a previous study in our lab, the age of 43 years was an inflection point at which the total volume of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) started to increase with age [36], and the age of ≥65 years was commonly used to refer to the older group [44,45,46,47,48,49]. Thus, this study included a stratification analysis by age group (young: <43, middle-aged: 43–64, and older: ≥65 years).",c157630e-3756-48e7-a7d5-31311a91d3b8
8,methods8,"  In addition to baseline total grey matter volume (TGMV) residuals and mean thickness, covariates also included age, gender, years of education, National Adult Reading Test-assessed Intelligence Quotient (National Adult Reading Test assessed Intelligence Quotient (NARTIQ)), race/ethnicity, total daily energy intake, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH), which were all measured at baseline; as well as follow-up interval, which was calculated as the time interval between the baseline and follow-up visits in years. Gender was dichotomized with males as the reference group. Race/ethnicity was categorized into three groups: non-Hispanic white and other (as the reference group), non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic. All other covariates were continuous variables.  2.3. Statistical Analysis  Mean and SD were reported for continuous variables, and frequency and percent were reported for gender and race/ethnicity.",3e3eecde-aef7-4bf1-8953-b3559ccae050
9,methods9," Analysis of variance (and race/ethnicity Analysis of variance (ANOVA)) for continuous variables and Pearson’s chi-square tests for categorical variables were conducted to compare participants’ characteristics among tertile MeDi groups. A one-sample t-test was used to examine if the change in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden from baseline to follow-up equals zero over an average of five years. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate the effect of MeDi on white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change. Moderation effects by age (young: <43, middle-aged: 43–65, and older: ≥65 years), gender, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White and other, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic) were examined by including the interaction term of moderator × MeDi into the models. Stratification analyses examining the effect of MeDi on white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change were subsequently performed by each age, gender, and race/ethnicity group.",95e9b393-1245-4030-8b60-6857b4f09750
10,methods10," Tertile MeDi group was also examined in the moderation and stratification analyses. Two-sided p < 0.05 indicated significance; interaction terms were considered statistically significant at p < 0.10.  3. Results  3.1. Characteristics of Study Population  Table 1 presents a descriptive summary of the participants’ characteristics. Among all participants, MeDi score ranged from 12 to 43 with an average of 28.20 (SD = 5.54). white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden significantly increased over the mean baseline to follow-up interval of 4.86 years (SD = 0.61) (mean difference [MD] [follow-up-baseline] [SD] = 0.31 [0.48], p < 0.001), and this significant accumulation in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) was also observed within each MeDi group, age group, gender group, and race/ethnicity group. Participants in middle and high MeDi groups, compared to those in low MeDi group, were more likely to be females (p = 0.001) and to report a higher level of total daily energy intake (p = 0.016).",72fe6c77-b7bf-4d57-ae1d-f1dfa9c23276
11,methods11," The tertile MeDi groups did not differ in other socio-demographic characteristics, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), brain markers, or follow-up interval.  3.2. Association between MeDi and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) Change  Figure 2 shows the relationship between MeDi score and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) (log) burden in baseline and follow-up visits. Among the majority of the participants, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden in the follow-up visit was greater than or equal to that in the baseline visit. The change in the white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden between baseline and follow-up decreased with the increase in MeDi score. After adjusting for the effects of social-demographic characteristics, caloric intake, brain markers, and follow-up interval, we found that a higher MeDi score was associated with less of an increase in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden (β = −0.014, 95% CI = −0.026–−0.001, p = 0.",170921de-dc09-4bf4-a86b-6baea32da17b
12,methods12,"034), indicating that people with a healthier diet had less of an increase in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden (Table 2), which was aligned with the findings presented in Figure 2.  3.3. Moderation Analysis on the Association between MeDi and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) Change  After adjusting for the covariates, the association between MeDi and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change was significantly moderated by age (young group as the reference, p-interaction[middle-aged × MeDi] = 0.075, p-interaction[older × MeDi] = 0.037), such that young participants showed less increase in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden for each unit increase in MeDi score, compared to the middle-aged or older participants (Table 2). Moderation effects by gender or race/ethnicity did not reach statistical significance.",1641f7a5-84e5-42da-9282-6cc0901f8d09
13,methods13,"  In the stratification analysis by age, gender, and race/ethnicity, a significant association between MeDi score and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change from the fully adjusted model (Model 3) was observed in the young group (β = −0.035, 95% CI = −0.058–−0.013, p = 0.003), but such an association was not significant in other age, gender, or race/ethnicity groups (Table 2, Figure 3).  In terms of the three MeDi groups, in the fully adjusted model, the significant association between MeDi score and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change was observed in the low MeDi group only (β = −0.053, 95% CI = −0.091–−0.015, p = 0.008), indicating that participants with diets less similar to MeDi had less of an increase in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden with each unit increase in MeDi score.  3.4.",d4fe3d41-5c65-4c76-be80-12a404606f93
14,methods14," Association between Individual Food Categories and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) Change  We further explored the associations between individual food categories and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change by entering the scores of the 11 food categories into the model simultaneously, adjusting for age and follow-up interval (Table 3). Greater intake of vegetables (β = −0.095, 95% CI = −0.162–−0.028, p = 0.006) and less intake of dairy (β = −0.045, 95% CI = −0.086–−0.004, p = 0.031) were significantly associated with less increase in white matter hyperintensity (WMH).  In order to test the moderation effect of age on the associations between individual food categories and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change, an interaction term of each individual food category by continuous age was added to the models, adjusting for follow-up interval. The interaction term of age and food category was significant in the models for vegetables (β = 0.003, 95% CI = −0.0002–0.",43a61c8c-0fbf-4370-9eee-eccfe0ffdca2

In other words, associations between intake of these food types and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change were stronger among younger participants than older participants.  4. Discussion  In this longitudinal study of 183 cognitively intact adults, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden increased within an average of five years from baseline to follow-up. Greater adherence to MeDi was associated with a lesser increase in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden, and this association was moderated by age group and MeDi group. Specifically, a significant association was observed in the young group and the low MeDi group but not in other age and MeDi groups.",cd4ebd6c-7a05-4d41-9c6a-5b527007a3da
16,methods16,"  The finding that white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden increased over time has been commonly found in previous studies, the majority of which focused on older adults [37,50,51,52]. Indeed, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden has been considered to reflect some age-related cerebrovascular diseases [53]. Only a few studies have measured white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden in middle-aged adults and reported that white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden commonly appeared in middle age [31,34,35,36]. Specifically, a previous cross-sectional study published in our lab reported an inflection point of 43 years, indicating that white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden started to accumulate after age 43 years [36]. Besides, another study found that white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden may also show an age-related increase among participants under 40 years, although the magnitude may be much smaller than in older people [31,32,33].",37b9300e-b502-4772-b1ab-6468ee14856f
17,methods17," Overall, it seems white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden accumulates in all young, middle-aged and older adults.  Although a few studies examined the association between MeDi and cross-sectional white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden with both significant and insignificant findings [3,9,14,15,29,30] with only two studies reporting that MeDi was significantly associated with lower white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden [3,30], the association between MeDi and longitudinal change in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden needs to be further investigated but has received extremely limited attention [54]. To the best of our knowledge, no study has focused on such an association, although one study reported a lesser increase in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden with better omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [54].",26ee7c77-ed7a-40fb-9067-e53577641cab
18,methods18," However, since it may be difficult to reverse the accumulation of white matter hyperintensity (WMH), once it starts to accumulate [31,32,33,34,35,36,37], the current study provides critical evidence that a modifiable lifestyle factor, MeDi, may slow the accumulation of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and help maintain brain status [3,30]. The biological mechanisms by which MeDi impacts white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden are unclear but might involve multiple pathways: [55] MeDi has been reported to be beneficial to improved endothelial function [56,57], lower obesity [58,59], and better cardiovascular health [14,55,60,61,62], by reducing the risks of cardiovascular disease [63,64], insulin resistance [65,66], and inflammation [67,68,69,70].  The significant impact of vegetables [12,71,72,73,74,75] and dairy [72,76,77,78] on white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden aligns with previous findings [30].",dcc3237e-b4af-43cc-b70b-fe6bee79ea7c
19,methods19," Some nutrients mainly found in vegetables, such as dietary fiber and vitamins B, C, D, and E, have been reported to be associated with white matter integrity [12,71,72,73,74,75]. Dairy products, which are rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs), were reported to be associated with higher volume of white matter damage [72,76,77,78]. Fiber may help regulate the gut microbiota and glucose metabolism and further enhance insulin resistance in the brain [71]; B-vitamins may assist in regulating energy by supplying homocysteine metabolism [74]; vitamins C and E may provide antioxidant properties [73]; and vitamin D may be involved in the regulation of neurotransmitters and neurotrophin and may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant neuroprotective capacities [75]. SFAs may be associated with metabolic, inflammatory, and microvascular changes, which may result in the damage of white matter in the brain [78].",782d17e4-6408-4ed5-8ec7-379470636237
20,methods20,"  Since few studies have examined how age moderates the association between MeDi and the increase in white matter hyperintensity (WMH), the current study provides innovative evidence on the moderation effect of age on this association. Notably, the results may demonstrate a relatively stronger association between diet and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change in the young group, despite baseline white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden being lower in this group, which might provide some evidence that it may be beneficial to following a healthy diet at an early age to maintain a healthy brain.  We found a significant moderation effect of the MeDi groups on the association between MeDi score and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change, wherein the association is stronger in the low MeDi group, which may result from diminishing marginal effects [79,80].",45a236b5-c5f3-44d1-8117-139be8a82da1
21,methods21," The contribution of MeDi to white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change might be specified as increasing with diminishing marginal health effects until the adequacy cutoff level (i.e., somewhere in the middle MeDi group) is reached [79,80] and then the contribution of MeDi remains stable in high MeDi group.  This study is subject to several limitations. The first limitation is that the CR/Reference Ability Neural Network (RANN) study only focused on the New York city metropolitan area, so the results may need to be generalized with caution. Second, the MeDi score was measured only one time per visit, even though the questions in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) asked about the average frequency of food intake per month. People’s dietary patterns may change over time, so it may be cautious to interpret the answers in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) as habitual dietary patterns.",2a362c24-c625-4faf-9db4-9217e4b10fc0
22,methods22," Third, other neurologic manifestations and brain alterations, such as celiac disease, may also need to be considered in further analyses [81]. Fourth, since the study is currently in the process of completing the five-year follow-up visit, the sample size of certain subgroups was limited, such as non-Hispanic black and Hispanic participants, which might account for the insignificant interaction between MeDi and race/ethnicity on white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change. However, the study sample is not different from the overall study population, and the findings remained statistically significant after controlling for sufficient covariates. Finally, a wide age range was analyzed in the relatively small sample size, which may ignore smaller effects in the analyses.  This study also has several notable strengths.",46bcd25e-4a65-46d2-b40f-05e43c83a4f5
23,methods23," To begin with, this innovative study examined the association between MeDi and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change with a longitudinal study design, which may provide more convincing evidence of a true association, with less possibility of reverse causality, compared to cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, this study included both young and older adults, and therefore allowed for comparisons of the effect size of MeDi between young, middle-aged, and older adults. This study is also strengthened by using a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) measure with 11 food categories to calculate MeDi scores, which reflects a more comprehensive measure of overall dietary pattern. Besides, the scores for both overall MeDi (0–55) and each food category (0–5) were operationalized as large-scale scores, which readily allow for an estimation of dose-dependent associations with outcomes from a wider variation [3,41].",cf75062b-57db-43f7-b868-9e20543e116a
24,methods24," Lastly, we statistically controlled for the effects of structural brain measures and participants’ socio-demographic characteristics and demonstrated that the role of MeDi in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) change could be detected independent of other potential confounders.  5. Conclusions  Greater adherence to MeDi was associated with reduced increase in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) over time. Following a healthy diet, especially at an early age, may help maintain a healthy brain. The underlying mechanisms between MeDi and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) accumulation warrant further examination.
