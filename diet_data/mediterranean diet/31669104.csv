0,methods0,"2.1. Sample All schools in the five different municipalities that compose the Valley of Ricote (Region of Murcia, Spain) were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. Thus, six primary schools agreed to participate. There were 250 schoolchildren (41.2% females) aged 8–13 (9.7 ± 1.2) from six primary schools with similar socio-demographic characteristics. To this end, participants were chosen using a non-probability sampling.  Children had to be authorised by their parents or legal guardians in order to participate in the study. Both parents and their children received prior information concerning the objective of the research and the type of testing that would be conducted. As a criterion for exclusion in the study, those children who were exempt from participation in Physical Education classes were not included.",c2ba0682-ebcd-40a0-a495-0742ecfedaab
1,methods1,"  This study was undertaken in conformity with the Helsinki Declaration, with full respect for the human rights of the children and was ratified by the Bioethics Committee of the University of Murcia (ID 2218/2018).  2.2. Data Collection 2.2.1. Sociodemographic Data Participants’ age and sex were declared by themselves. The type of schooling was divided into 2 categories: public and private with public funding. Additionally, area of residence was dichotomised into urban (>5000 inhabitants) and rural (≤5000 inhabitants).  2.2.2. Physical Activity Participants fulfilled the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ)-C) to provide an estimation of the moderate-to-vigorous physical activity they engaged in the previous seven days [28]. This tool has been validated and translated into Spanish [29] and has nine items which are rated on a 5-point Likert scale.",33afa436-0c94-4ff8-9f07-a41dbc06f083
2,methods2," For further analysis, the percentage of minutes per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was calculated according to Saint-Maurice et al.’s equation [30]. Thus, two categories were established: ‘meeting PA recommendations’ (≥420 min per week) and ‘not meeting PA recommendations’ (<420 min weekly), according to the international recommendation of 60 min of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (on average) [1].  2.2.3. Anthropometric Measurements Participants’ height was measured by means of a portable height rod with a measuring precision of 0.1 cm (Leicester Tanita HR 001, Tokyo, Japan). Their body weight with a digital scale (with a precision of 0.1 kg) (Tanita BC-545, Tokyo, Japan). A constant tension tape with an accuracy of 0.1 cm was used to determine the waist circumference, at the point between the edge of the iliac crest and the last rib. Waist-to-height ratio was calculated dividing the waist circumference by the height (both in cm).",139c476f-f11a-4276-8859-0b6d91e7515c
3,methods3," Skinfolds were measured with a precision of 0.2 mm with professional steel plicometers (Holtain, Crosswell, Crymych, UK) at the triceps, biceps, iliac crest, and subscapular. The Siri formula was applied to estimate body fat mass from body density [31].  2.2.4. Obesity Related-Parameters Participants’ body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was determined by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. Considering the World Health Organization (WHO) age- and sex-specific thresholds, body mass index (BMI) z-score was computed, and then weight status was determined [32]. Abdominal obesity was established by the waist-to-height ratio cut off point of 0.5 [33]. Likewise, body fat percentages higher than 25% for boys and 30% for girls were considered as a ‘high adiposity’ [34].  2.2.5.",6405216b-2842-4b7d-a16b-cd309d784d8d
4,methods4," Physical Fitness PF was assessed by the extended Assessing Levels of Physical Activity (Assessing Levels of Physical Activity (ALPHA)) health-related fitness test battery, previously described in detail and validated in children and adolescents [35]. This battery includes certain tests in order to determine cardiorespiratory fitness (20-m Shuttle Run Test), upper muscular strength (handgrip strength test), lower muscular strength (standing broad jump) and motor fitness (4 × 10 Shuttle Run Test). To generate an estimation of the global PF variable, the results of the four different tests were transformed into z-scores by sex and age as follows: z-score value = (value − mean)/standard deviation (SD). Then, the sum of these z-scores was computed to establish the global PF score [36]. All participants completed the test during their Physical Education lessons.  The very same team of researchers carried out all the measurements.",a41788a3-dbd3-4e95-8757-32cdb11577d9
5,methods5," Such measurements were taken as a circuit, in which participants completed each test one after another, except for the cardiorespiratory fitness test, which was performed by several participants at the same time. The physical measurements took one hour per school group to be completed.  2.2.6. Screen Time Children were questioned about the average time they normally spent in both daily screen time (TV or videogames) with the next question: ‘‘On an average school day, how many hours do you watch TV or play videogames?’’. Screen time was categorised into “low screen time” (less than 2 h per day) and “high screen time” (2 h per day or more), according to the Canadian recommendations for screen time [25].  2.2.7. Mediterranean Diet In order to determine the adherence to the MD, the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index for children and adolescents (KIDMED) index was used [37]. It consists of 16 questions with an index ranging from 0 to 12.",1cd4c35c-fdda-44d9-877b-57ed18bd4f10
6,methods6," Items that imply negative connotations with respect to MD score as −1, and those with positive connotations with +1. In this way, by adding up the results, three different levels are obtained: (1) >8, high MD; (2) 4–7, moderate MD; (3) ≤3, low MD [37].  2.3. Data Management and Statistical Analysis All the continuous variables were presented as a mean (M) and standard deviation (SD), and the categorical variables as a number (n) and percentage (%). The assumption of the normality was checked by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test with Lilliefors’ adjustment. To verify the homogeneity of variances, Levene’s test was applied. Consequently, the data were examined using Mann–Whitney U test or Student’s t test for two-groups comparisons; based on whether or not the assumption of normality is met. In the case of finding differences between groups, post-hoc tests were carried out by Mann–Whitney U test with Bonferroni adjustment.",498d6d0e-7c6a-4b09-ab24-aa24d74163df
7,methods7," Contrariwise, for normally distributed variables, Dunnett T3 test or Tukey’s honestly-significant-difference (honestly significant difference (HSD)) was applied according to the homogeneity of the variances. Relationships between categorical variables were estimated by chi-square test. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were applied to assess the mean differences of the dependent variables (obesity-related parameters, global PF score, screen time hours, and KIDMED score) with respect to the participants meeting PA recommendations (‘meeting PA recommendations’ and ‘not meeting PA recommendations’), after adjusting by several covariates. Prior to this, variables that had biased distributions were transformed. To help interpretation, the two-step approach to transform normally undistributed continuous variables into normal distributions was used [38]. The included covariates were age, type of schooling (public/private) and area of residence (rural/urban).",6e6e1092-2652-4395-89f0-1fbf0b7a5953
8,methods8," Data analysis was carried out by the software SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) for Windows (v. 24.0). The statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.  3. Results Data of age, anthropometry, PF tests, MD, screen time, and sport activities of the sample, according to sex are shown in Table 1. Girls had higher body fat percentage than boys; however, no statistically significant differences were found according to obesity-related parameters between sexes. In the case of PA, boys showed higher scores than girls in Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ)-C as well as the number of minutes of weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Likewise, a higher proportion of boys met the PA recommendations (54.4%); showing statistically significant difference compared to girls (12.6%). Conversely, girls scored higher than boys in KIDMED test.",45445e3d-a12c-4b25-91ee-f537a18f6c98
9,methods9,"  Figure 1 shows the proportion of participants meeting the moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recommendations and the different independent variables of the study. In both sexes, a higher proportion of participants who met the PA recommendations were of normal weight, no abdominal obesity, and low adiposity compared with children with different obesity-related parameters categories. Likewise, most of the girls meeting the PA recommendations presented medium or high global fitness score (84.6% for the sum of both categories). Additionally, a higher proportion of children that met the PA recommendations also comply with the Canadian recommendations of screen time; especially in the case of girls (69.2%). However, no statistically significant association was found for any variable. In the case of MD, only a low number of children considered as active showed high adherence to the MD (11.3% for boys and 7.7% for girls).",eefd70b9-edc7-42ac-91bc-c0282ad926f5
10,methods10," Further information about frequencies (absolute and relative) of these associations are shown in the Table S1.  Lastly, Table 2 states the mean differences of the independent variables of the study with respect to the compliance of PA recommendations, after adjusting by several covariates. Thus, the percentage of girls who did not meet the PA recommendations is higher (87.4%) than that of boys (45.6%); for the whole sample, 62.8%. According to obesity-related parameters; girls meeting the PA recommendations show lower values (body mass index (BMI) z-score, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio and body fat percentage); not being so in the case of boys. Moreover, ANCOVA revealed higher values in global PF in those who meet the PA recommendations in both boys and girls. Likewise, these greater results were shown for MD in both sexes; not being so in the case of screen time. Notwithstanding, none of these mean differences were statistically significant.  4.",0963d746-434f-4f53-83cd-fab6576bb5e9
11,methods11," Discussion The aim of this study was to determine the number of schoolchildren complying the PA recommendations and to compare obesity-related parameters, global PF, screen time, and MD in relation to the meeting of PA in Spanish schoolchildren aged 8–13.  In line with the results obtained, girls show less minutes of weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), as well as a lower proportion of participants meeting the PA recommendations. In the whole analysed sample, it was noted that six out of every ten children are considered as insufficiently active, with higher prevalence in the case of girls. These results are in line with those obtained in other international recent studies [5], as well as others in Spain [9,10] or in the Region of Murcia [39]. This low prevalence of active children emphasises the need to establish public policies that provide effective interventions in families, schools and communities in order to increase PA levels in young population [5].",582e33ef-51e3-4673-a8d1-96884ab2b17f
12,methods12,"  On the other hand, not meeting the moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recommendation has been linked to a greater association with childhood obesity regardless of screen time and sleeping time [16,40]. In this line, we found a greater proportion of children with normal weight, no abdominal obesity and low adiposity who met the PA recommendations in both boys and girls. However, a lack of statistical significance was found in our sample. A possible justification for this discrepancy could be justified by the different tools for measuring the PA level [41]. Additionally, this fact could be partially explained due to the high prevalence of children who have overweight/obesity in the Region of Murcia; it being the region with the most obese children [15].",cc6bb32d-f7e2-4bb1-a8f2-ce487c85cea3
13,methods13," Another reason for this lack of association could be the fact that moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) only accounts for a small proportion (<5%) of the 24-h period, with the remaining 95% dedicated to sleep, sedentary behaviour, and light-intensity activities [42]. In that concern, some studies indicate that most children spend a large proportion of their awake time being active at low levels of intensity [43,44,45], especially girls [45]. Notwithstanding, other study only found weak associations between the time spent in light-intensity activities and body mass index (BMI) z-scores [16].  In addition to the above, children who meet the PA recommendations presented higher scores of global PF, especially in the case of girls. In this concern, substantial data indicated that health and fitness benefits will occur in most children and youth who participate in 60 or more minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on a daily basis [2].",bf120663-e2a8-47e9-a892-5fd8d7e4c5c8
14,methods14," However, within groups with similar fitness, the risk is higher in insufficient active individuals compared with those who comply PA recommendations [27]. Although much of the variability in physical condition is genetically determined, environmental determinants and especially PA influence PF [46].  The excessive time spent in sedentary behaviours, and particularly screen time, has been negatively associated with health outcomes in the scientific literature [42]. The odds of engaging in daily PA decreased significantly with increasing time spent in daily screen time, for both sexes, and greater volumes of daily screen time were associated with lower odds of daily PA practice for both boys and girls [47]. Additionally, another study shown higher association between meeting the PA recommendations and the screen time international recommendations for both sexes [48].",e0c6dc19-4a3e-4616-a374-b2794681369d
15,methods15," In this line, we found that most of the children considered active comply with Canadian recommendations of screen time (less than 2 h per day), mainly in the case of girls. However, we did not find statistically significant differences between the compliance of the PA recommendations and the number of hours spent in screen time in our sample. Thus, the main reason could be the fact that we inquired how many hours they spent watching TV or playing videogames, without examining the use of smartphones, tablets, and other small screens currently used by children and youngsters [42]. Moreover, another reason that could justify this lack of association is the higher amount of screen time shown in our sample. Thus, more than half of our sample do not comply with the Canadian recommendations proposed by Tremblay et al. [25].",671a3358-7983-442b-861c-7d322cf72251
16,methods16," These results coincide with the high prevalence that it has been recently found in Spanish children and adolescents during the week (more than 50%); almost 80% being those who not meet with the recommendations on weekends [9].  With regards to the adherence to the MD, only a small proportion of children considered as active showed a high adherence to the MD. This fact could be explained by the low proportion of children who met the PA recommendations in our study (about one in three participants) and the low number of participants with high MD (one in four children). This low proportion of children with high adherence to the MD is in line with the tendency towards the abandonment of the MD, especially in youths [24]. Nevertheless, we found higher mean values of KIDMED score were shown for those who meeting the PA recommendations, especially in girls. These results agree with the previous findings of Iaccarino et al.",d32fd122-e41e-43e0-a133-e6a7534272ff
17,methods17," [23] who reported a positive relationship between greater levels of PA and KIDMED score in their systematic review. At the same time, these results match with those offered by Tambalis et al. [48] in both boys and girls, as well as those indicated by other authors [49,50]. However, these authors employed a different instrument to determine the PA level, which could have an influence on the results. On the other hand, the fact of being physically active and less sedentary and the preference of taking healthy food has been reported in a previous study [51]; the fact of following healthy eating habits (e.g., MD) is an important marker towards embracing more active behaviour. Concerning the justification of this association, earlier studies, mainly performed in adolescents, suggest that those who practise more PA could desire a superior performance, choosing healthier meals to attain it [52].",cd3f7f65-4d4d-4b61-b054-57491065a76c
18,methods18," Additionally, there is the fact that more PA needs more energy expenditure [4] and those who report higher PA would be expected to have a greater consumption of essential nutrients [53] than the MD might provide.  The main strength of this study is the wide combination of factors studied (obesity-related parameters, global PF, adherence to the MD and screen time) in relation to the compliance of PA recommendations. Likewise, another strong point is the addition to current knowledge in Spanish children, in order to satisfy the need indicated on the lack of information on PA indicators [10]. Conversely, in this research, we found certain limitations. Firstly, given the cross-sectional nature of this research, it cannot be concluded that the associations found indicate causal association. Additionally, the sample was not recruited using a random selection (probability sampling). However, despite this, all schoolchildren from the sampled schools were encouraged to participate.",2a76791c-ec73-4145-84ad-ea99d1477f1d
19,methods19," Another limitation that we found is related to the lack of information on socioeconomic status, sleeping hours, or individual’s developmental stage. For example, Tanner Stage, as an indicator of sexual maturation, may have provided a more accurate figure of cardiorespiratory fitness, as evidence has been found of its use in monitoring fitness tests [54]. Moreover, if we had measured PA objectively using accelerometer devices, it would have given us a more precise calculation of PA patterns and sedentary behaviour. Notwithstanding, the model offered by Saint-Maurice et al. was highly correlated with the recorded accelerometer values (r = 0.63).  Meanwhile, current PA recommendations from World Health Organization (WHO) establish that youth should at least accumulate 60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily; most of it being aerobic and vigorous intensity activities.",2c62bbde-1f84-47b3-82aa-234fbeefdfef
20,methods20," Nevertheless, other international recommendations indicate that it would be recommended to change the statement “at least 60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day” to “at least 60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day on average” [25]. The formula that we have used to estimate the minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), calculates the total amount of weekly minutes from the percentage of daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA); not being able to verify that children exceed every day the 60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), as indicated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Consequently, there are currently no specific recommendations for light-intensity activities; this is necessary in future research for a better understanding of all the components of movement in the 24-h period on different health outcomes [16].",c2d544f8-1cec-41e8-a846-b920bd614693
21,methods21," For this reason, collective and international collaborative efforts are needed to modify the persistent trends of low PA and high screen time among children and adolescents around the world [5].  5. Conclusions To conclude, the proportion of schoolchildren meeting the PA recommendations in our study is low. When comparing children, with respect to meeting international PA recommendations, higher proportions of those who meet with PA recommendations present normal weight, no abdominal obesity, and low adiposity in comparison to other obesity-related parameters categories in both sexes. Likewise, those considered as active children seem to have higher global PF score and adherence to the MD than children who do not meet the recommendations. Nevertheless, this association was not found in the case of the hours of screen time.",4794d4d5-1873-443f-a115-e1daf983e81c
22,methods22,"  From a health perspective, these results emphasise the need to promote policies and interventions aimed at encouraging the practice of PA among school children, in order to improve their health through increased PF. These policies should be targeted especially at girls, to ensure participation in sport activities that ensure a minimum of PA practice and reduce sedentary habits.
