Compared with average adherers, low adherers had higher based on simple anthropometric [body mass index (BMI), energy intake, and percentage of energy from lipids, mainly saturated fat and polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)), and lower Sirt4 levels. After adjusting for based on simple anthropometric [body mass index (BMI), Sirt4 levels remained negatively correlated with Visceral adiposity index (VAI). After adjusting for total energy intake, Sirt4 levels remained negatively associated with PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) and consumption of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), vitamins C and E. The threshold value of PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) predicting the lowest decrease in Sirt4 levels was found at a score of 6.",dd4f84b5-eccd-42b2-ac31-8d519d170a25
1,results1,"   Conclusions  Less reduced Sirt4 levels in obese patients adhering to MD suggest a further aspect of the antioxidant advantage of MD.  Italian Ministry for University and ResearchPRIN 2012 ==== Body 1. Introduction Diet, a modifiable environmental factor, is a mainstay in the management of obese individuals. Mediterranean diet (MD) is a healthy dietary pattern based on a common dietary pattern of the Mediterranean countries [1]. In particular, the MD is characterized by very low amounts of saturated fatty acid (saturated fatty acid (SFA)) and a high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acid (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) and micronutrients, including dietary vitamins and minerals, commonly reported to increase the plasma antioxidant capacity [2].",ec79af86-96d0-4e51-9735-bcfdba2906c2
2,results2," In addition, the quantity and quality of dietary lipids are known to have an impact on excess storage of lipid as triglycerides (TG) in both adipose tissue and in nonadipose tissue sites, such as the liver [3], which can have subsequent deleterious metabolic effects. On the other hand, the excess storage of lipid occurs as a consequence of continuous oversupply of fatty acids caused by enhanced lipolysis or adipocyte dysfunction, together with an alteration of the fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondria and the production of the reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), a by-product of oxidative phosphorylation [4, 5]. In particular, an altered fatty acid oxidation pathway plays a key role in the development of hepatic steatosis (HS) and inflammation on a high-fat diet [6].",2aa89081-7b38-41a7-808e-3b4314ace542
3,results3," The visceral adiposity index (Visceral adiposity index (VAI)) is a gender-specific mathematical index based on simple anthropometric [body mass index (based on simple anthropometric [body mass index (BMI)) and waist circumference (WC)] and metabolic [TG and high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) cholesterol] parameters [7]. Visceral adiposity index (VAI) has been proposed as a surrogate marker of adipose tissue distribution and/or dysfunction, independently correlated with insulin sensitivity and cardiometabolic risk both in the general population [8] and in patients with different pathologic conditions, including HS [9].  Sirtuins (Sirt), generally known as lysine deacetylases, are a complex of proteins involved in the control of several biological processes, including lipid oxidative metabolism [10], via the regulation of proteins' acetylation-deacetylation pathways.",303794b6-3759-4ecb-969e-cce2c23015f2
4,results4," In turn, Sirt pathways, acting as metabolic sensors in situations of energy stress and nutrient deprivation, are regulated by macronutrient availability [11]. Despite conserved deacetylase domains, mitochondrial sirtuin 4 (Sirt4) is the most efficient lipoamidase among mitochondrial sirtuins. Sirt4 regulates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex via enzymatic hydrolysis of the lipoamide cofactor, thus modulating acetyl coenzyme A production, Krebs cycle activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation [12]. Afterwards, it became apparent that Sirt4 is involved in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation in the liver [13–15]. In line with this finding, we have reported that circulating levels of Sirt4 were reduced in obese patients with HS, although the possible contribution of the diet and the adipocyte dysfunction on this association was not investigated [16].",133b1342-5738-4874-abf3-a330d9acb1ce
5,results5,"  The current study is based on the hypothesis that the antioxidant properties of MD might be associated with the circulating levels of Sirt4 in the obese individuals. To clarify these associations, we investigated the possible relationship between circulating levels of Sirt4 and as follows: (i) the adherence to the MD; (ii) the single dietary components evaluated by 7-day food records; and (iii) degree of HS, measured by liver ultrasound and Visceral adiposity index (VAI), as marker of adipocyte dysfunction.  2. Subjects and Methods 2.1. Design and Setting This is a cross-sectional observational study carried out by the Endocrinology Unit of the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery at University Federico II in Naples (Italy). The study has been performed in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans, and it has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the University Federico II (n.5/14).",9368501e-f814-4192-ac93-5955be96eab4

Population Study Out of the 257 consecutive obese subjects visiting the outpatient Obesity Unit of the Section of Endocrinology, University of Naples Federico II, from December 2013 to September 2015, 43 adult individuals referred to our unit for bariatric surgery evaluation and were enrolled in this cross-sectional observational study. A full medical history, including drug use, was collected. Criteria for exclusion from the study were as follows: (a) hypocaloric diet in the last three months or specific nutritional regimens, including vegan or vegetarian diets (38 and two subjects, resp.",32ed6daa-e4b1-4b02-8d64-a606d8e3bb4d

8,results8," Finally, six subjects dropped out from the study since they refused to undergo full laboratory-instrumental examinations (Figure 1).  Information on smoking habit and physical activity was obtained by a standard questionnaire. Subjects smoking at least one cigarette per day were considered current smokers, while former smokers were the subjects who stopped smoking at least one year before the interview. Remaining participants were defined as noncurrent smokers. Physical activity levels were expressed according to whether the participant habitually engaged at least 30 min/day of aerobic exercise (YES/NO). Physical active participants were advised to avoid the physical activity in the 3 days before blood sampling. Participants were classified according to their alcohol intake into two groups: YES or NO alcohol consumption.",babfc96b-24d2-4880-bf2c-0d44bf3dfc70
9,results9," Among alcohol consumers, heavy alcohol consumption was defined as more than two standard drinks per day, which is equal to a daily intake of <30 g of alcohol for men and <20 g of alcohol for women.  In all individuals, systolic (systolic (SBP)) and diastolic (diastolic (DBP)) blood pressure were measured in three times, two minutes apart, with a random zero sphygmomanometer (Gelman Hawksley Ltd., Sussex, UK) after the subject had been sitting for at least 10 min. The average of the second and third reading was recorded.  Hypertension was defined as systolic (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg on two different occasions or taking antihypertensive medication.",c32cb632-01fc-4306-b793-474b1450d8ad

A history of using oral hypoglycemic agents or a type 2 diabetes was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association (American Diabetes Association (ADA)) criteria [18].  2.3. Anthropometric Measurements All anthropometric measurements were taken with subjects wearing only light clothes and without shoes. In each subject, based on simple anthropometric [body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2). Height was measured to the nearest one cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer. Body weight was determined to the nearest 100 g using a calibrated balance beam scale.",37947f24-c32d-46a3-829c-b8b3f563902d
11,results11," The degree of obesity was established on the basis of based on simple anthropometric [body mass index (BMI) cut-off points of 30.0–34.9 kg/m2 (class I obesity), 35.0–39.9 kg/m2 (class II obesity), and ≥40.0 kg/m2 (class III obesity) [19]. WC was measured to the closest 0.1 cm with a nonextensible tape. The measurements were made with the subject standing upright, feet together, and arms hanging freely at the sides, with the subjects standing and breathing normally. WC was measured at the midpoint between the inferior costal margin and the upper iliac crest. According to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III (National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)-ATP III) criteria, abdominal obesity was defined as WC ≥ 102 cm in men and ≥88 cm in women [20].  2.4.",77c3f260-37f7-4130-84a2-e82f48041476
12,results12," Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet The adherence to the MD was evaluated using the previously validated 14-item questionnaire for the assessment of PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)) [21]. A qualified nutritionist administered the questionnaire during a face-to-face interview to all the enrolled subjects. Briefly, for each item, scores 1 and 0 were assigned; PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score was calculated as follows: 0–5, lowest adherence; score 6–9, average adherence; and score ≥ 10, highest adherence [21].  2.5. Dietary Assessment As already reported by [22], data were obtained during a face-to-face interview between the patient and a qualified nutritionist. In detail, the dietary interview allowed to quantify foods and drinks by using a photographic food atlas (≈1000 photographs) of known portion sizes to ensure accurate completion of the records [23].",bd625be5-c13e-4c11-913e-9f681b2d5d6e
13,results13," Moreover, dietary data, including beverage intakes and alcohol consumption, were collected by a 7-day food records. The subjects returned the records to the nutritionist who asked supplemental questions if necessary. Data were stored and processed using a commercial software (Terapia Alimentare Dietosystem® DS-Medica, http://www.dsmedica.info). Considering quantities and qualities of foods consumed, the software is able to calculate not only the daily caloric intake but also the quantities of macronutrients (protein; total, complex, and simple carbohydrates; total fat, saturated fatty acid (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA): n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)s ratio; cholesterol; and fibers) and antioxidant nutrient intake, such as vitamins A, C, D, and E, and iron, selenium, and zinc.",d40724d0-eae5-4a18-ba85-d4eabbf0b38c

The quality was assessed using the Index of Nutritional Quality (Index of Nutritional Quality (INQ)), which is based on the nutritional density per 1000 kcal. The Index of Nutritional Quality (INQ) was calculated by dividing the nutritional intake per 1000 kcal of total energy intake by the recommended intake (RI) of protein, carbohydrate, and fat per 1000 kcal.",c60cbaee-d18d-4148-b236-d0370eb1b0d5
15,results15," The RI values were obtained from the MD recommended, in particular, the macronutrient energy recognized as adequate in the MD is 55–60% of carbohydrates, 10–15% of proteins, and 25–30% fat [25]. Each Index of Nutritional Quality (INQ) value ≥ 1.0 indicates adequate nutritional intake, while values < 1.0 indicated inadequate nutritional status. In this study, the Index of Nutritional Quality (INQ) was calculated for protein, carbohydrate, and fat [26].  2.6. Assay Methods Samples were collected in the morning between 8 and 10 a.m., after an overnight fast of at least 8 h and stored at −80°C until being processed. All biochemical analyses including fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, fasting plasma TG, alanine transaminase (alanine transaminase (ALT)), aspartate aminotransferase (aminotransferase (AST)), and γ-glutamyltransferase (γGT) were performed with a Roche Modular Analytics System in the Central Biochemistry Laboratory of our institution.",19ff869e-9e80-4d6f-b65f-53ea60ec1bae

The sensitivity of this assay was defined as the lowest protein concentration that could be differentiated from zero. It was determined by adding two standard deviations to the mean optical density value of twenty zero standard replicates and calculating the corresponding concentration. The minimum detectable dose of human Sirt4 was less than 0.051 ng/mL. No significant cross-reactivity or interference between human Sirt4 and other sirtuins was observed, according to manufacturer data.",33c2204f-66a6-4c1e-a9d0-c872688ce2fb
19,results19," Intra-assay precision was determined as follows: three samples with low, middle, and high level human Sirt4 were tested 20 times on one plate. The inter-assay precision was weighed testing three samples with low, middle, and high level human Sirt4 on 3 different plates, 8 replicates in each plate. The coefficient of variation, calculated by SD/mean × 100 for the intra-assay and inter-assay was <10% and <12%, respectively.  2.9. HS Evaluation The presence of HS, commonly known as “bright liver”, was assessed with a US diagnostic system (Logiq P5, General Electric, Milan, Italy) with a 3.5 MHz convex probe. All the US determinations were made by the same trained operator. The intraoperator variability, as evaluated in 20 subjects within 1 week from the first ultrasonographic examination, showed an overall r value of 0.92 (p < 0.001).",49212f67-7848-404a-b8a9-e6fe9e289df4

Technically, echo intensity can be influenced by many factors, particularly by gain intensity. To avoid confounding factors that could modify echo intensity and thus bias comparisons, mean brightness levels of both liver and right kidney cortex were obtained on the same longitudinal sonographic plane.  2.10.

31,results31," To compare the relative predictive power of the food items included in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) and the score of adherence to the MD associated with the circulating levels of Sirt4, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis using models that included as measures of the consumption frequency of each food items of PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire along with the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score. Using these models, PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score entered at the first step (p < 0.001) and followed by the fruit consumption ≥ 3 serving/day (p = 0.009). To compare the relative predictive power of the intake of food and beverage associated with the circulating levels of Sirt4, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis using models that included as measures of the intake of the single micro and macronutrients obtained by the 7-day food records.",9df1e7c8-9101-4c4d-81c9-bcea3ba22a37

Based on the multiple linear regression analysis with ordinal predictors, the most significant (α = 0.05) threshold value of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score predicting the lowest decrease in circulating levels of Sirt4 was found at a score of 6 (p < 0.001) (Figure 2).  4. Discussion The present study evidenced a positive association between adherence to the MD and circulating levels of Sirt4 in obese individuals. In addition, a careful investigation of the dietary pattern using the 7-day food records demonstrated that the circulating levels of Sirt4 are negatively correlated with energy intake, and positively with the intake of antioxidant vitamins and minerals considered in this study.",3803c392-8680-484c-9b94-dc11e7ee4d63
33,results33," Finally, we found that circulating levels of Sirt4 were negatively correlated with surrogate markers of ectopic fat storage and visceral fat dysfunction, independently of the severity of the obesity. Of interest, although experimental studies evidenced that physical activity might affect the Sirt4 expression [30], we found that the associations between Sirt4 and variables included in this study remained significant also after adjusting for physical activity.  We previously reported that in obese individuals with higher degree of HS, there were lower circulating levels of Sirt4 [16]. Although in our preliminary study, we hypothesized the involvement of a high calorie intake in reducing circulating levels of Sirt4; the possible influence of the dietary pattern on the circulating levels of Sirt4 was not investigated.",49ac8d81-6f44-40f8-901f-fcc9f6e9c8a1
34,results34,"  The present study further extends our previous observations as it demonstrates that lower circulating levels of Sirt4 were actually associated with a specific dietary pattern in obese individuals. In particular, the classification of patients according to the degree of adherence to the MD demonstrated that subjects with an average adherence presented a lower reduction in circulating levels of Sirt4 when compared to subjects with a low adherence, independently of age and gender, with a PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score ≥ 6 predicting the lowest decrease in circulating levels of Sirt4. Next, the study demonstrated that the highest consumption of food items characteristic of the MD, such as fruits, extra virgin olive oil, vegetables, and fish, was associated with a lowest decrease in circulating levels of Sirt4.",93333473-d61d-4a8b-aa2a-f706c4fa7317
35,results35," The positive association between adherence to the MD and circulating levels of Sirt4 is consistent with the diet-induced modifications in Sirt1 [31] in the larger context of the diet-induced, epigenetic mechanisms [32]. This observation could be of potential interest considering the emerging role of Sirt4 as tumour suppressor recently reported in different human tumour cell lines [33] and the well-known antitumour properties of the MD [34, 35].  The 7-day reports allowed us to obtain detailed information on the diet composition in subjects with low and average adherence to the MD. As expected, we found a highly significant correlation between PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score and Mediterranean adequacy index (MAI), an index developed to assess how close a diet is to the Healthy Reference National Mediterranean Diet [36].",b3682936-4345-41a6-aaa0-7305d6239c01
36,results36," When compared with average adherers, low adherers had a higher total energy intake, higher consumption of fat, mainly saturated fatty acid (SFA) and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and lower consumption of complex carbohydrate, protein, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and fiber, and lower Index of Nutritional Quality (INQ) for macronutrients. Consequently, low adherers had a low intake of all antioxidants considered in this study. Of interest, after adjusting these results for total energy intake, circulating levels of Sirt4 remained significantly and positively associated only with the consumption of nutrients with the highest antioxidant properties, such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and vitamins C and E, and negatively correlated with the consumption of saturated fatty acid (SFA).",6e8b2924-5725-40e3-bcbb-32e3e085e772
37,results37," The positive association of Sirt4 levels with dietary antioxidant intake and the negative association with Visceral adiposity index (VAI) might be of particular interest considering the involvement of visceral adiposity in low-grade inflammation [7, 8] and the well-described effects of MD in inflammatory gene expression [37]. Using the multivariate analysis model, circulating levels of Sirt4 were well predicted by the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score and the consumption n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).  As expected, obese subjects with a low adherence to MD presented worse anthropometric measurements and metabolic profile. In addition, as expected, low adherence to MD was associated to a higher HS grade when compared with subjects with an average adherence, independently of age and gender.",16ac2256-41e1-424e-a677-d42d6e810087
38,results38," Besides HS, this study reported a novel association between adherence to the MD and circulating levels of Sirt4 with Visceral adiposity index (VAI), a well validated, reliable, and widely used marker of ectopic visceral distribution and function [28]. In particular, Visceral adiposity index (VAI) was higher in low adherers compared with average adherers and showed a negative correlation with circulating levels of Sirt4.  Taking together the results of this study: (i) lend support to the hypothesis that the increase in energy intake in obese individuals was associated with blunted circulating levels of Sirt4 as an adaptive mechanism to decrease fat oxidative capacity, but promoting lipid storage in ectopic tissues; (ii) suggest that the healthy combination of antioxidant vitamins and minerals characteristic of the MD could contribute to dampen this mechanism, probably reducing the oxidative damage and the ectopic fat storage.",56e5e7bb-b4ea-4896-8b32-d62e1c93dfa1
39,results39," In line with this hypothesis, circulating levels of Sirt4 were well predicted by either the adherence to the MD and the intake of specific nutrients with antioxidant properties, independently of the energy intake; (iii) let us hypothesize that circulating levels of Sirt4, similarly to Sirt1, might undergo diet-induced epigenetic modifications, thus contributing to the antitumour properties of healthy diets, such as MD; and (iv) evidence that the lowest circulating levels of Sirt4 were associated not only to the highest grade of HS but also to the highest visceral fat dysfunction, independently of the severity of the obesity and physical activity.  Despite these very interesting results, the main limitation of this study is that the cross-sectional design does not allow to identify any causal association between the variables included.",00eb6e98-d31a-4fe1-9d9c-969a04ade03c
40,results40," Second, we are aware that the sample size is small and the based on simple anthropometric [body mass index (BMI) range is wide and is not a measurement of body composition [38]. Nevertheless, we found that circulating levels of Sirt4 were negatively correlated to Visceral adiposity index (VAI), an index that incorporates also waist circumference, a far more accurate benchmark for visceral adiposity, also independently of based on simple anthropometric [body mass index (BMI). Third, we do not provide experimental data on muscle biopsy sample between tissue expression and circulating levels of Sirt4; thus, our hypothesis of a compensative regulation of Sirt4 by diet remains speculative.",c7d2ae06-500e-4e56-9d13-1251f88535d6
41,results41," Furthermore, the suggested value of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score for the recognition of the lowest decrease in circulating levels of Sirt4 should be viewed with caution until results will be extended to larger patient populations in order to perform an appropriate cross-validation. However, this study has adequate statistical power, the observed differences between low and average adherers were statistically significant, and correlations have been adjusted for based on simple anthropometric [body mass index (BMI). In addition, in order to improve the power of the study, very stringent inclusion criteria have been applied, such as normal thyroid function or, according to our recent observations [39], normal somatotropic axis. Finally, the strength of this study is the usage of the 7-day food records.",064f8004-7568-420d-93e1-4634e5477e3b
42,results42," Although one week may not be representative of their usual dietary habits, this method of dietary assessment is considered as the “gold standard” in validation studies of different types of self-administered food frequency questionnaires, allowing a more accurate measurement of the real dietary and macronutrient intakes compared to those obtained by retrospective food frequency questionnaires [40, 41]. In addition, to reduce the effect of over- or under-reporting of individual foods, nutrient intake was adjusted for total energy intake.  Thus, although the results were partially limited due to the lack of specific markers of oxidative stress, the detailed information on the diet composition obtained by the 7-day food records was consistent with a more reduced intake of antioxidant nutrients in low adherers compared with average adherers.  4.1.",dc9751b1-62eb-45f2-8e4b-6347c712341a
43,results43," Conclusions A lower reduction in circulating levels of Sirt4 was found in obese individuals with average adherence to the MD compared with low adherers, in association with lower ectopic fat storage and adipocyte dysfunction, independently of based on simple anthropometric [body mass index (BMI). Circulating levels of Sirt4 varied in association not only with energy intake but also with antioxidant nutrient intake. The positive association between the adherence to the MD and circulating levels of Sirt4 suggests that the Sirt4 increase might represent further aspects of the antioxidant and antitumor advantage in obese individuals of the Mediterranean dietary pattern and support the role of qualified nutritionists as members of integrated multidisciplinary teams in the complex management of obesity.
