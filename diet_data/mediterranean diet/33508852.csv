0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Ethics  The current study is part of a research project carried out under the frame of MeDiWeB (Mediterranean Diet and Well-Being) consortium [29,30,31] which was designed to assess MD adherence and other Mediterranean lifestyle characteristics across participants of three Mediterranean (MED) (Spain, SP; Italy IT; Portugal PT) and two non-Mediterranean (MED) countries (Bulgaria, BG; Republic of North Macedonia, NMK), and to explore their association with subjective well being (SWB). For this purpose, we developed and applied an online questionnaire (MeDiWeB questionnaire) with 57 questions divided into three sections [29]. The first section consisted of an introductory explanation of the study and the nature of the participation, with a question at the end asking for authorization to use the data anonymously for statistical analysis and scientific publication.",35f64588-2303-441e-b18c-5a51f35a345b
1,methods1," After consenting to fill the questionnaire, the participants proceeded to the second section which included a number of questions about sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle habits, health related characteristics (BMI and diagnosed pathology), and subjective well being (SWB). The third section was devoted to dietary habits and included, among others, the 14 items used to calculate MD adherence (14-Mediterranean (MED)AS score) [31]. The questions were structured following the operation and Development (OECD) recommendations regarding subjective self-reporting, specifically, inclusion of subjective evaluation questions at or near the beginning of the survey, to avoid any potential bias effects [3]. The questionnaire was approved by the Ethics Committee of each partner research institution and complies with European Regulation on Data Protection [36]. A full English version of questionnaire can be found at [29] within the Supplementary Materials section.",59dfeb6f-7e39-4715-a9fb-9928c36ad7ee
2,methods2,"  With regards to subjective well being (SWB), a total of 11 questions were assessed using a 11-point Likert-type scale, where 0 = not at all to 10 = completely/all the time. The questions were classified as hedonic or eudaimonic according to operation and Development (OECD) [3] as follows: (1) Life satisfaction (hedonic, cognitive evaluation)—overall, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?; (2) Worthwhile life (eudaimonic)—to what extent do you feel that the things you do in life are worthwhile; (3) Feeling happy (hedonic, positive affect)– how happy did you feel during the last week?; (4) Feeling worried (hedonic, negative affect)- how worried did you feel during the last week?; (5) Feeling depressed (hedonic, negative affect)- did you feel depressed during the last week?; (6) Feeling nervous and stressed (hedonic, negative affect)- during last week, how often did you feel nervous and stressed?; (7) Unable to cope (eudaimonic)—during last week,",4002b901-4fbd-45e5-a8e4-4dca7507c84d
3,methods3," how often did you feel that you were unable to cope with all the things you had to do?; (8) Confident to handle problems (eudaimonic)- during last week, how often did you feel confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?; (9) Energetic (eudaimonic)- last week, how energetic did you normally feel in the middle of the day?; (10) Tired (hedonic, negative affect)—last week, how tired did you normally feel in the middle of the day?; (11) Efficient (eudaimonic)– last week, how efficient did you normally feel in the middle of the day?  2.2. Data Collection  The questionnaire was prepared in the national language of each of the participating countries, and was disseminated through institutional mailing lists, social media, personal contacts, and word-of-mouth communication for the collection of data. The questionnaire was confidential and filled anonymously online. Data were collected between April 2019 and mid-March 2020 (before the COVID-19 lockdown).",33fa44ec-48a4-4ea3-9aee-6bc375077465
4,methods4," Participants who indicated (i) lack of consent, (ii) age < 18 years, (iii) duplicates, and/or (iv) participants whose nationality differed from the country in which they were living in, were eliminated from the study. A total of 2400 adults (age ≥ 18 years) distributed across SP (N = 485), PT (N = 484), IT (N = 505), NMK (N = 434) and BG (N = 492) were finally included in the analysis.  2.3. Statistical Analysis  The variables were qualified as nominal, ordinal and continuous variables and tested for normality and heteroscedasticity (Kolmorogov–Smirnoff and Levene tests) rendering the use of non-parametric analysis as the best choice [37]. We present and discuss the results of scale variables using the mean ± standard deviation (SD), as well as the median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)). Absolute frequencies and percentages are used to represent ordinal or nominal variables.",100f7f2b-a7dd-464b-b011-d214d4f20872
5,methods5," We additionally estimated the standardized mean difference (standardized mean difference (SMD)) as (mean score Mediterranean (MED) group—mean score non-Mediterranean (MED) group)/total sample SD [38]. Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to assess differences between Mediterranean (MED) and non-Mediterranean (MED) groups of countries, and between countries, respectively, for continuous variables; Chi-squared tests were used for nominal and ordinal variables. All statistical tests were based on two-sided tests (bilateral significance) with a significant level of 5% (α = 0.05).  Exploratory factorial analysis of the subjective well being (SWB) items with Varimax rotation and Kaiser Normalization was used for data reduction, and components with eigenvalues above 1 were retained. The number of components to retain was also based on scree plot analysis, the variance explained by the factor model, and the pattern of factor loadings [39].",dbd20c82-0867-45f1-8fdd-9b9210030bc7
6,methods6," The adequacy of data for the factor analysis was evaluated by Keiser–Meyer–Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO < 0.5 unacceptable; 0.51 to 0.60 poor, but acceptable; 0.61 to 0.70 mediocre; 0.71 to 0.80 moderate; 0.81 to 0.90 good; 0.91 to 1.00 excellent), and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity (p < 0.001) [40]. Reliability was assessed with Cronbach’s alpha (<0.5 unacceptable; 0.51 to 0.60 poor; 0.61 to 0.70 questionable; 0.71 to 0.80 acceptable; 0.81 to 0.90 good; 0.91 to 1.00 excellent), and Composite Reliability (CR > 0.7) [41]. Convergent Validity was assessed by Average Value Extracted (AVE, >0.5 acceptable; >0.7 very good) [41]. All questions were coded in the same direction, thus, an inverted scale, 10–“x”, was applied to the following questions: feeling worried; feeling depressed; feeling nervous and stressed; unable to cope. A final 9-item tool was considered reliable to use across the participant countries to estimate a subjective well being (SWB) score.",b30fb1a3-737a-4073-b72b-7471569f1d5f
7,methods7,"  To investigate the potential association between the subjective well being (SWB) score (dependent variable) and the different sociodemographic, health status and lifestyle factors included in this study (independent variables), we first estimated non-parametric partial Spearman correlation coefficients (ρ) adjusted in each case for the corresponding confounding variables. The confounders were identified by significant (p < 0.05) bivariate correlations between the subjective well being (SWB) score and each of the studied factors: sex, age, nationality, education level, marital status, number of meals per day, smoking, sleeping hours at night, time spent in nature, time spent with family, time spent with friends, sharing meals, daily normal activity, leisure activity, sport practicing, BMI, pathology and 14-Mediterranean (MED)AS score.

8,methods8," Since conducting multiple analyses on the same dependent variable may result in increased chance of committing a Type I error, the p-value adjusted by Bonferroni’s Correction is additionally indicated (p-value < 0.0025) [42].  We next wanted to further test the hypothesis of how the different independent variables (factors) may act together to affect the dependent variable (subjective well being (SWB) score), and to confirm the nature (positive or negative) and significance of the relationship. For this purpose, we used those variables first identified as statistically correlated with the 9-item score (p < 0.05) to enter them into a multiple linear regression model, conducted using the backward stepwise method.

Sample Sociodemographic and Lifestyle Characteristics  The comparative analyses of the sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics of Mediterranean (MED) and non-Mediterranean (MED) participants are included in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively, (data of each of the individual countries are presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Overall, most of the evaluated characteristics were significantly different between the Mediterranean (MED) and the non-Mediterranean (MED) groups (most p-values < 0.001). The global sample population (N = 2400) was constituted by a higher proportion of women (66.6%) than men (33.3%) (Table 1). Participants were, on average, ≈38.0 years old with the oldest participants from Mediterranean (MED) countries (40.1 ± 14.2), and the youngest ones from non-Mediterranean (MED) countries (36.7 ± 13.7). Around 52% of the population was married or in an analogous relationship, and the number average household members was between three and four.",0791e51e-5b07-4a48-adb8-1a358fd5c435
10,methods10," Most of the participants had a high education level, with higher percentage for Mediterranean (MED) participants (79.5%) than non-Mediterranean (MED) ones (61.9%). The majority of the participants were employed (≈65%), mostly having “white collar” jobs (professional, desk, managerial, administrative work, etc.). Most of the participants were healthy (66.7 to 86% reported not to have a diagnosed pathology) and were in the normal weight BMI class (≈24 kg/m2; normal weight between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2).  Regarding lifestyle characteristics, most participants were non-smokers (≈65–85%) and had sedentary habits (Table 2). More than 80% of the participants reported to have a low daily activity. At leisure time, most of the participants preferred relaxing activities or activities that did not require physical efforts. Only 27.3% of the participants from Mediterranean (MED) countries and 11.6% from non-Mediterranean (MED) countries practiced a more intense activity.",c32b017e-59cd-446c-bc70-f990ddadca35

Most of the sample population distributed their spare time between family (frequently), friends and nature (sometimes) with small differences between Mediterranean (MED) and non-Mediterranean (MED) participants.  With regard to eating habits, most of the participants declared sharing their meals with family or friends, with this proportion being higher in the Mediterranean (MED) participants (83.8%) than in the non-Mediterranean (MED) ones (75.8%). There were also significant differences between these two groups in the frequency of meals per day, with three to five meals per day in the Mediterranean (MED) representatives and two to four meals per day in the non-Mediterranean (MED) ones.",28d872a0-5a9a-4166-91a9-83c4fdd01ad8
12,methods12," The data of the 14-Mediterranean (MED)AS score have been reported in a previous study [30] and are included here as variables for further comparative and correlation analyses. Overall, Mediterranean (MED) and non-Mediterranean (MED) participants showed moderate (7.34 ± 1.85) and weak (5.57 ± 1.82) MD adherence, respectively (p-value < 0.001).  3.2. General Overview of subjective well being (SWB)  Table 3 collects the scoring for the 11 hedonic and eudaimonic items evaluated in this study in the overall sample and in the Mediterranean (MED) and non-Mediterranean (MED) groups of participants (results for individual countries are presented in Supplementary Table S3). Positive perceptions of eudaimonic and of hedonic items presented median scores between 6 and 8 points of the 0 to 10 Likert-type scale (Table 3).",4d751048-61bf-41da-9cd6-73d7ea49b290
13,methods13," The highest scores were observed for the eudaimonic meaning item “worthwhile life” and the hedonic evaluative item “life satisfaction”, with the highest scores observed in the Mediterranean (MED) participants (worthwhile life, 7.84 ± 1.46, followed by life satisfaction, 7.48 ± 1.50). Negative perceptions of eudaimonic functioning and hedonic affect presented a higher variation, with median scores between 2 and 6 (Table 3). The lowest scores were observed for the responses to “feeling depressed” (3.17 ± 2.76 in the Mediterranean (MED) group of countries, and 3.36 ± 3.07 in the non-Mediterranean (MED) group).  Comparison between the Mediterranean (MED) participants vs. the non-Mediterranean (MED) participants shows that the differences between these two groups of participants reached statistical significance only for some items (eudaimonic: worthwhile life, efficient, energetic; hedonic: life satisfaction, happy, worried).",5c8d4aa6-d068-4d2c-b95a-a5f06d3205fc
14,methods14," Higher values were observed in Mediterranean (MED) participants for all these items, but the magnitude of these differences was small. We estimated the standardized mean difference (“effect size”) between the Mediterranean (MED) and non-Mediterranean (MED) groups that ranged from a minimum difference of −0.02 for the item “feeling tired” up to a maximum difference of 0.5 for the item “life satisfaction” (Table 3).  3.3. subjective well being (SWB) 9-Item Tool: Properties and Estimation of the subjective well being (SWB) Score  We next investigated the combination of those 11 items into a pooled subjective well being (SWB) tool that could be used to estimate a subjective well being (SWB) score and to analyze the relationships between the subjective well being (SWB) score and different factors. An exploratory factorial analysis with the 11 items was first performed, resulting in three extracted components.",fda45db0-fa2d-4f76-a00d-7a44162f4572
15,methods15," The items ‘confident to handle problems’ and ‘tired’ did not load uniquely in any of the extracted components, both for the global sample and for each of the individual countries. In addition, these two items displayed a different distribution in the three extracted domains among the countries and thus, both items were removed from the set of items used to construct the pooled item score [43]. The analysis proceeded with the remaining 9 items, which showed good adequacy to the factor model (Table 4). Factor extraction rendered two components that summarized 61.8% of total variance (Table 4).

Internal consistency, composite reliability, and convergent validity of the 9-item pooled score and components were considered adequate (Table 4). Factor analysis was also performed with individual countries to ascertain that the 9-item pooled score could be used to compare the countries participating in the present study. Analysis rendered the same two components, explaining more than 50% of total variance, and the same distribution of items between the two extracted components was observed among all countries (Supplementary Table S4).  We used the subjective well being (SWB) 9-item tool to estimate the subjective well being (SWB) score for each country (Supplementary Table S5) and to compare Mediterranean (MED) and non-Mediterranean (MED) participants (Table 5).",950b7e77-167b-4570-b83d-37b944bd713e

We additionally estimated the partial scores for the C1 and C2 components. Participants from the Mediterranean (MED) countries also showed a higher score for the pooled positive perceptions (C1) than participants from the non-Mediterranean (MED) countries (7.0 ± 1.3 vs. 6.5 ± 1.6, p < 0.0001).

Of the 20 independent variables included in the analyses, six of them were not significantly correlated with the pooled subjective well being (SWB) score (education level, household, siesta, meals per day, sharing meals and BMI; p-value > 0.05).

Overall, the estimated correlation coefficients ranged from 0.148 and −0.075, indicating that the association between these six variables and the subjective well being (SWB) score was rather low (Table 6).  Following the correlation analyses, the variables that were found to be significantly (p-value of <0.05) associated with the subjective well being (SWB) score (age, sex, smoking, employment status, marital status, pathology, hours of sleep at night, time spent with friends, time spent with family, 14-Mediterranean (MED)AS score or adherence to the MD, time spent in nature, leisure activity, daily basal physical activity, and sport practicing) were all entered into the multiple linear regression model.",b6d3ecc0-3e58-4b52-8ca2-37e0207d2374
20,methods20," The data analysis resulted in several good working models, with the best model (Anova p-value < 0.000) including all the above independent variables. As shown in Table 7, the model confirmed that several Mediterranean lifestyle characteristics act as positive predictors of the 9-item subjective well being (SWB) score; namely, a higher adherence to MD (14-Mediterranean (MED)AS score), adequate rest (sleeping longer at night), being active (higher daily normal activity, leisure activity and sport practicing), spending more time socializing with family and friends, and spending more time in nature. Not smoking also acts as positive predictor. Regarding sociodemographic and health related variables, older age, being a man, being married or in an analogous relationship, being employed, and not having a pathology also positively contributes to a higher subjective well being (SWB) score. Overall, the combination of these variables explained around 17% of the variance (R = 0.424, R2 = 0.",29e75823-4af1-4404-9b03-840ab4f161f6
21,methods21,"180, R2 adjusted = 0.173).  4. Discussion  The development and application of different tools and terminology to measure well-being perception is partially a consequence of the complexity of fully defining this perception and of establishing all the main components and factors that influence it. Throughout the literature in the area, there appears to be a consensus that multiple-item instruments measuring subjective well being (SWB) should include two main dimensions, i.e., hedonic and eudemonic dimensions [5,7,17,43,44,45].  In this study, we have implemented a 9-item tool consisting of a combination of hedonic and eudaimonic items to measure and compare subjective well being (SWB) across different populations from Mediterranean (MED) and non-Mediterranean (MED) countries. Our results show that, on average, the estimated subjective well being (SWB) score was slightly higher in the Mediterranean (MED) group of participants (6.3) than in the non-Mediterranean (MED) ones (6.1).",ed967237-959b-47e3-b684-085d42f1c5bc
22,methods22," The specific individual country scores were: SP = 6.6, PT = 6.2, IT = 6.1, NMK = 6.2, BG = 6.0 (data obtained between 2019 and the start of 2020). Of the two components that are part of the 9-item subjective well being (SWB) score, it is interesting to note that small but significant differences between Mediterranean (MED) and non-Mediterranean (MED) participants were only achieved for the component containing items related to positive perceptions (7.0 and 6.5, respectively). This difference might be particularly attributed to the lowest scoring for specific questions such as those referring to ‘worthwhile life’ and ‘life satisfaction’, where the difference between participants from BG and the other participants was above one point (data in Supplementary Table S3).",09a652e3-a9c8-43da-b2f8-ad9d34ac048d
23,methods23," Nevertheless, these results are in line with previous cross-cultural studies that reported low overall happiness across the Balkans and Eastern European Post-Communist countries with prevailing Christian Orthodox populations, with the exception of NMK, where the percentage of “very happy” people was close to that in SP and PT [46].  In a reasonable agreement with our results, the life satisfaction by country reported in the most recent WHR (2017–2019) was also ranked higher in the Mediterranean (MED) countries, SP ≈ IT = 6.4 > PT = 5.9 than in NMK = 5.2 and BG = 5.1 [47]. Similarly, the European Quality of Life Survey (2016) indicated that BG and NMK showed lower life satisfaction values (5.6 and 5.1, respectively) than SP, PT and IT (7.0, 6.9 and 6.6, respectively) [48], and data from the operation and Development (OECD) (2018) established a similar ranking for Mediterranean (MED) countries (SP 7.7, IT 7.4, and PT 7.2) [49].",d39bd1a5-5985-49e2-a379-dd4db9fa1e0d
24,methods24," All these results point to some common issues:(1) A general moderate perception of subjective well being (SWB) across European Mediterranean (MED) and non-Mediterranean (MED) countries, in agreement with the ranks reported in Eurostat regarding life satisfaction in 2018 (i.e., 58.6% of Europeans were classified into medium life satisfaction, 25% into high life satisfaction, and 16.4% reported low life satisfaction) [50];  (2) There is a slightly higher subjective well being (SWB) perception in participants from the Mediterranean (MED) countries, than in those of the non-Mediterranean (MED) countries, with Spanish participants displaying the highest position in the ranking. These results do not appear to have been much altered in recent years;  (3) The measured differences in the subjective well being (SWB) score between the countries are rather small, and thus confirming the exact ranking for each country is not a trivial task.",17d1bc90-0651-4d0b-87cc-ecd98b38871d
25,methods25,"  The 9-item subjective well being (SWB) tool implemented in this study has supported all these outcomes and may constitute a valuable tool to measure subjective well being (SWB) perception in larger populations across different countries. In addition to having a good subjective well being (SWB) measuring tool and, given the increasing interest in understanding the relevance of subjective well being (SWB) both at the individual and at the society levels, it also remains crucial to clearly delineate the factors that influence well-being perception. These factors could be used as predictors to develop and apply appropriate strategies to improve subjective well being (SWB) and its associated co-benefits [13].",c3fc64af-ae2f-441d-9b0b-b97696b1b0e5
26,methods26," Using correlation analyses and different regression models, a considerable number of studies have already provided some evidence of the positive or negative association between subjective well being (SWB) and a range of health-related factors, sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle factors, including age, sex, BMI, education, income or dietary habits. For example, the young to middle-age class, as well as people with tertiary education level, tended to report higher subjective well being (SWB) than upper secondary education levels or older age classes [49]. Sex has been found to influence subjective well being (SWB) perception, but it was moderated by age [51]. Improved health has also been associated with better subjective well being (SWB), with this association being stronger in developing countries than in the developed ones [52].",bb5cd45d-6e06-4ebb-9faa-75d3f41e4682
27,methods27," In addition, a lower income was associated with higher psychological distress [53], but the association of income inequality and subjective well being (SWB) may be influenced by the development of the country economy [54]. In addition, healthy lifestyles have been associated with subjective well being (SWB) in SP, where eating specific foods (fruits and vegetables), being in the company of family and friends, engaging in more exercise and feeling healthy have all a positive influence on life satisfaction and happiness [26]. A similar result was reported in IT, where higher adherence to MD or consumption of a vegetable-based dietary pattern were positively associated with psychological resilience [55]. BMI and body image have also been indicated to have a key role for happiness in Spanish adults [56]. In an additional latest study, the consumption of fruits and vegetables has been found associated with life satisfaction in Spanish adults with a high BMI [25].",3b6c621b-a1c4-401f-981a-88b9bdbffc18
28,methods28," Overall, the results are still limited, are associated with specific populations, and show some ambiguity, which suggests that these factors may all interact in a complex way to influence subjective well being (SWB).  In the present study, we have implemented correlation analyses and multiple linear regression models between the 9-item subjective well being (SWB) score and a broad range of sociodemographic, health related factors, lifestyle and dietary factors in the global sample population from five Mediterranean (MED) and non-Mediterranean (MED) countries. Our results further support that closer adherence to MD (measured by 14-Mediterranean (MED)AS score) and other Mediterranean lifestyle habits (spending time with friends and family, spending time at nature, leisure activities and practicing sport, and adequate rest at night) have a positive influence on the 9-item subjective well being (SWB) score.",cd686e31-8954-45dc-baf3-ffabe895d0f0
29,methods29," The association between well-being and a healthy diet has been widely recognized but the specific link of subjective well being (SWB) and the consumption of a particular diet or food component is not yet understood. Recently, the lack of evidence for the association between the MD global indicators and subjective well being (SWB) has been reported; however, there appears to be some links between the intake of specific food items (fruits, vegetables, sweets) and subjective well being (SWB) [25,26]. The complexity of the interaction between diet and subjective well being (SWB) deserves further and thorough investigation.  In addition, our results suggest that women seem to have a lower subjective well being (SWB) perception, which agrees with data from 29 countries from the European Social Survey, confirming that women are more likely than men to experience depressive symptoms [14].",15b1b48e-d380-43de-a1c2-91d341b12a0e
30,methods30," Our results also point to the fact that having a diagnosed pathology and smoking have a negative influence on the 9-item subjective well being (SWB) score, whereas being older has a positive effect. Importantly, our results show that all the variables investigated here display significant but weak correlation coefficients with the 9-item subjective well being (SWB) score confirming that our well-being perception is, in part, the result of a multiple factorial influence with small co-effects. Other variables not included here (i.e., income) may contribute to better predicting the 9-item subjective well being (SWB) score but, we cannot discard the possibility that other different and more complex models of interaction may occur. Indeed, the association between subjective well being (SWB) and all these different factors has been described as a two-direction relationship so that a better subjective well being (SWB) can also influence other aspects in our lives [13,57].",ae255718-ec9b-4b88-adef-c846f0e84c59
31,methods31," Further studies are still needed to clarify the association between the different factors and subjective well being (SWB) using a validated instrument applicable to different countries and, if possible, at different time periods. The proposed 9-item subjective well being (SWB) score could be a relevant tool for this purpose.  Although there is ample research supporting current self-report measures of subjective well being (SWB) with strong psychometric properties with regards to consistency, reliability and validity, there is still skepticism on using self-reported methods to record the construct of subjective well being (SWB) since these may be subjected to response bias [5,58]. This relates to whether responders have the willingness to provide honest and adequate answers to the researchers or even if they deceive themselves about their own well-being when responding to the questionnaires [57,58].",94de6797-16a9-4d70-9fdb-3f7a83384983
32,methods32," In the present study, provision of an online questionnaire might have biased the sample towards a more homogeneous population of middle-class, young to middle aged, with a better education and job status. Indeed, the age distribution of the studied sample was more representative of the working age adult population in Europe, whereas ≥65 years of age respondents constituted only 3% of the participants, and over 70% of participants had a university degree. In addition, from overall 65% employed respondents, more than 90% have a white-collar type of job which suggests that most of these participants have a middle to higher income. It should be reiterated that most studies exploring relationships between subjective well being (SWB), lifestyle and/or sociodemographic factors have a cross-sectional design and can only establish associations but do not permit to draw causality.",e86d382a-2229-462f-abc9-b8c18444e20f
33,methods33,"  Among the strengths of this study is the fact that we assessed a relatively large sample population (N = 2400) including participants from five culturally diverse European countries who provided extensive information regarding various aspects of their well-being and health behavior-related data. Another strength of the study is the restricted eligibility of participants to only native citizens of the respective countries, and the exclusion of participants from other nationalities or those living abroad, in order to minimize the effect of culturally-related factors and/or possible language barriers that may introduce biases when measuring subjective well being (SWB).",2f44d8de-404b-491b-9edf-7939a145efca
34,methods34," An important advantage of this study is the assessment of both hedonic and eudemonic indicators, and its combination into a pooled 9-item score which gives us the ability to explore the relationships between subjective dimensions of well-being and sociodemographic, health related factors and lifestyle habits in the different countries. In addition, the application of a finer response scale may give the ability to obtain more detailed insight into a person’s feelings [59], which is implemented in our research by the use of an 11-point Likert-type scale for assessment of every question in the questionnaire.  5. Conclusions  Over the past two decades we have outgrown the traditional measures of Gross Domestic Product (Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) and economic growth as crude assessment tools of the living standards in society. There is a rising interest from governments and policymakers worldwide on the self-reported happiness of individuals.",35a108f6-0454-409f-bae6-0835e23f96cf
35,methods35," subjective well being (SWB) is an essential individual aspect which can impact the development and maintenance of healthy societies. The current study focused on the application of a 9-item subjective well being (SWB) tool that includes hedonic and eudemonic indicators, with two components, one that reflects feeling satisfied and fulfilled about life and yourself; and other that reflects aspects of negative psychological functioning, such as high perception of stress, depression, and a sense of being unable to cope with daily tasks. In response to the challenge of a global need to increase subjective well being (SWB), these two domains allow for the identification of issues that should be addressed in policy making. It is clear that in order to influence global well-being, greater emphasis needs to be placed on the individual and, as pointed by some authors, there is an urgent need to promote educational programs in the domains of human flourishing [60].",fb5786cb-f1bd-474e-9efe-2a7a4c9c2f27
36,methods36," We have observed significant but rather small differences in subjective well being (SWB) among the countries involved in our study, which would need assessment and further confirmation in larger population samples. Furthermore, our results showed significant but small correlations between subjective well being (SWB) and several demographic and lifestyle factors (age, sex, nationality, socializing with friends, enjoying nature, sleeping hours, smoking habits, and Mediterranean Diet), highlighting that our well-being perception is the result of a multiple factorial influence. Future research should emphasize the development of improved assessment with accurate instruments that can capture true differences between populations, together with larger scale observational and intervention trials, and comprehensive and functional plans to monitor progress.
