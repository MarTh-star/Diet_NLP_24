0,introduction0,"A third of all cancer-related deaths may be linked to diet [1] and inflammation-related mechanisms may be involved [2]. A pro-inflammatory diet estimated by higher Dietary inflammatory index (Dietary inflammatory index (DII)) scores has been associated with both systemic low-grade inflammation and increased risk of cancers including prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, and pancreas [3–6].  Excess body fat is an established risk factor for many types of cancers [1]. An energy-dense diet may induce weight gain, which can lead to a pro-inflammatory state, but also could increase cancer risk through an altered sex hormone profile [7]. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet, represented by a higher Mediterranean diet score (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)) [8], has been associated with both lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers and lower risk of several types of cancer [9].",e3c506bf-2c88-49b4-92b8-f011b0fe6f75
1,introduction1," The high dietary intake of antioxidants, including polyphenols, associated with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, may inhibit multiple cancer-related biological pathways [10]. Thus, defining a dietary pattern to distinguish between inflammation and other mechanisms by which the diet might influence cancer risk, is desirable.  The aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory impact of diet in determining cancer risk using two widely used indices, the inflammation-specific Dietary inflammatory index (DII) and an adapted Mediterranean diet score (MDS). These dietary indices were examined in 9,250 prospective cancer cases in a population-based cohort of 100,881 participants, including 35,393 individuals with repeated measures ≥10 years apart.

2,methods0,"Study cohort and study population Study participants were selected from the Västerbotten Intervention Programme (Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP)) cohort, an ongoing population-based, prospective cohort in northern Sweden, established in 1986 [11]. During a decennial health examination, residents 40, 50, and 60 years of age (also 30 years during 1990–1996), were asked to complete a questionnaire on diet and lifestyle and to donate a blood sample. This study included 100,881 participants (50.6% women) with data from Feb. 15, 1990 (excluding the first few years of the cohort, with less-standardized food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s) to Jan. 19, 2016 (Fig 1).

We also estimated associations between 10-year changes in dietary pattern scores and cancer risk. Participants with health examinations deviating by more than ±2 years from the Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) age groups or more than ±2 years from the 10-year time span between health examinations, were excluded. For participants with three measurements (n = 7,118), the two earliest measurements were used. After exclusions (n = 2,135), a total of 35,393 participants were included in the longitudinal analyses.",9d9b545c-6af5-4269-8049-60ee9059e2d4
5,methods3,"  Dietary data Dietary data were harmonized and refined by the Northern Sweden Diet Database (Northern Sweden Diet Database (NSDD)) management. Validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s—a longer version with 84 items and a shortened version of the same food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with 64–66 items—were used to calculate dietary pattern scores [12–14]. Food items, reported on a fixed, nine-option scale ranging from never to ≥4 times/day, were converted into daily intakes (g/day) using reported portion sizes combined with data from the National food composition database [15]. For nearly all repeated measures (99.8%), and 67.5% of the baseline measurements, the participants filled out the shorter food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).  Dietary inflammatory index Detailed descriptions of development and scoring algorithm of the Dietary inflammatory index (DII) [3], as well as construct validations can be found elsewhere [4, 5].",a30a28cf-e8fa-43fb-b7dd-a1d2221f7410
6,methods4," Briefly, nearly 2000 articles investigating the relation between specific dietary factors and six different inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha and CRP (C-reactive protein)) were reviewed. A total of 45 specific foods and nutrients were indexed and scored to derive an inflammatory effect score for each parameter. Dietary data were linked to a database including eleven datasets covering most regions of the world, from which means and standard deviations for the 45 food parameters were derived. These parameters were then used as multipliers to express an individual’s exposure relative to the “standard global mean” as a z-score, by subtracting the “standard global mean” from the reported amount and dividing the difference by the standard deviation.",2ee055d1-b8e4-4efd-b12d-f43b363a1d4e
7,methods5," The value was converted to a centered proportion score for each food parameter and subject, and multiplied by the corresponding food parameter effect score to produce a food parameter-specific Dietary inflammatory index (DII) score. In this study, 30 of the original 45 foods and dietary components were available for calculation, thus 15 food parameters were lacking (listed in S1 Table), a proportion similar to that observed in other observational studies using the Dietary inflammatory index (DII) [16–18].  Mediterranean diet score The Mediterranean diet is characterized by high intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, seeds, cereals, and olive oil, moderately high intake of fish, low to moderate intake of dairy products, moderate intake of alcohol, and low intake of saturated fat, meat and meat products [8].",823d106a-9ff0-4d93-8172-a8f5e684f9ed
8,methods6," We used an adapted version of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) previously applied in Swedish populations based on existing knowledge about positive health effect of whole-grain cereals, moderate alcohol intake, and also that polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) and not only monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) are important unsaturated fats in non-Mediterranean countries [19]. The adapted Mediterranean diet score (MDS) has eight components (listed in S1 Table), 1) vegetables and potatoes, 2) fruit and fresh juices, 3) wholegrain cereals, 4) fish and fish products, 5) ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) + polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to saturated fat (saturated fat (SFA)), 6) alcohol intake, 7) meat and meat products, and 8) dairy products. The intake of each component was adjusted to daily energy intakes of 2500 kcal for men and 2000 kcal for women, using the nutrient density method (e.g., component/total energy).",3fdd6b78-2124-4591-9fc4-9530d978d614
9,methods7," For components 1–6, a value of 1 was assigned to subjects whose consumption was higher than the sex- and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-specific median and 0 for intakes below the median, except for alcohol where participants with intakes <50g/day were assigned 1, and 0 if >50g/day. For meat and dairy products, a value of 1 was assigned for subjects with intakes below the median. The summed Mediterranean diet score (MDS) ranges from 0 (low adherence) to 8 (high adherence).  Covariates Smoking status was classified as daily smoker, ex-smoker (former daily smoker), or never smoker (including occasional smoker and former occasional smoker). Diabetes was defined as self-reported or diagnosed at the health examination according to fasting blood glucose (≥7.0mmol/L) or 2-hour post-load plasma glucose (≥12.2mmol/L in capillary blood). body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) was calculated using measurements taken by a health care professional.",e38dff02-36e0-4c2e-b966-e035091c7bd2
10,methods8," Physical activity refers to recreational physical activity, harmonized between questionnaire versions and classified in three levels: low (no recreational physical activity exercise), medium (up to 2 times a week), and high (≥3 times a week). Educational status was defined at three levels; elementary school (including lower secondary, up to 9 years of school), upper secondary school or post-secondary education. Total energy intake was calculated from food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-derived dietary data and expressed as kcal/day.  Identification of cancer cases Cancer endpoints were identified by linkage to the essentially complete regional branch of the Swedish Cancer Registry. Cases were defined based on ICD-10 codes as first incident malignancy (all types), as well as first incident breast (C50), prostate (C61), lung (C34), gastric (C16), pancreas (C25), colorectal (C18-C20.",a54d21a1-4194-4714-9686-474b5652c1a4

We also investigated smoking-related and obesity-related cancers. Smoking-related cancers were defined according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)) [20]. Tumor sites for which evidence of a link to tobacco smoking is suggested to be sufficient, are: lip/oral cavity/pharynx (C00-C14), liver/intrahepatic bile ducts, larynx/trachea/bronchus/lung (C32-C34), cervix (C53, D06), colorectum, kidney (C64), esophagus, pancreas, stomach, urinary bladder (C67), as well as acute and chronic myeloid leukemia (C91-95 and D46, excluding C91.4)[20].",7cc64d1e-0ede-4e5c-bdde-b8982433a70f
12,methods10," Obesity-related cancers were defined as cancer of the esophagus, gastric, colorectum, liver, gallbladder (C23-24), pancreas, breast (post-menopausal, approximated as breast cancers diagnosed after the age of 55 years), endometrium (C54), ovary (C56), kidney, meningioma (C70.0), thyroid (C73), and multiple myeloma (C90.0) [7]. Non-smoking-related and non-obesity-related cancers were defined as all other cancers not included in these definitions.  Ethics This study was approved by the Regional ethical review board of northern Sweden (Dnr 2013/332–31). All study subjects provided written informed consent at recruitment for all collection for research purposes, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  Statistical analyses Baseline characteristics of men and women were calculated for sex- and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-specific categories approximating tertiles of the dietary pattern scores.",1f473bfe-ce8b-493b-b203-9e4e83fbb2d2
13,methods11," Dietary inflammatory index (DII) tertiles (T) were constructed according to the distribution of participants. Mediterranean diet score (MDS) tertiles were distributed to avoid ties: T1) Score 0–3, T2) Score 4, and T3) Score 5–8. Comparisons were made using Pearson Chi-square tests for categorical variables and ANOVA for continuous variables. Correlations between dietary patterns were estimated with Spearman’s correlation coefficient.  Associations between baseline dietary patterns and cancer risk were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the time scale. The proportional hazards assumption was checked by evaluating Schoenfeld residuals. In the all-cancer risk analysis, sex showed signs of non-proportionality characterized as a higher risk of cancer in women compared to men before age 67 years and the opposite after age 67.",169cf23a-70a3-489e-a410-94c559a4744f
14,methods12," Therefore, risk estimates are presented for all participants, stratified by sex within the Cox model, but also for men and women separately. In the analysis of breast and lung cancer, both body mass index (BMI) and smoking showed signs of non-proportionality. Because stratification for body mass index (BMI) categories or smoking status did not affect risk estimates, estimates from non-stratified models are presented.  To facilitate comparisons between risk estimates, linear associations are presented as hazard ratios (HR) per tertile decrease in Dietary inflammatory index (DII) or tertile increase in Mediterranean diet score (MDS), obtained by modelling continuous scaled variables, i.e. by dividing each dietary pattern score by its respective sex- and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-specific intertertile range. The mean intertertile ranges were 1.7 for Dietary inflammatory index (DII) and 2 for Mediterranean diet score (MDS).",400172d1-de1c-4df1-864e-9e0c9721f404
15,methods13," Estimates were adjusted for covariates with a potential association to both dietary pattern and cancer risk: energy intake, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, smoking, and educational status. In sensitivity analyses, HRs were estimated separately by age groups (30–40, 50, and 60 years), smoking status (non smokers, ever smokers), and body mass index (BMI) (body mass index (BMI) >30kg/m2, body mass index (BMI) <30kg/m2). HRs were also estimated by excluding participants with diabetes. Heterogeneity in HR estimates between subgroups were tested with a Wald’s test.  To test for non-linear associations, continuous dietary pattern variables were modelled using restricted cubic splines (with knots at the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles). Tests for associations were made with a likelihood ratio test comparing the dietary pattern spline model with a model without the dietary pattern. Non-linearity was tested with a likelihood ratio test comparing the spline model to a linear model.",c602ae09-75a6-4984-93b6-2904a8c525ff
16,methods14,"  To assess the predictive accuracy of the dietary patterns, we estimated Harell’s C-index in Cox-models using the baseline measurement. C-indices were calculated using ten-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting.  We evaluated longitudinal associations between dietary patterns and cancer risk by fitting Cox models with start of follow-up 1 year after the repeat measurement, using age as the time scale. Participants were classified as “Unchanged healthy”, “Changed unhealthy to healthy”, “Changed healthy to unhealthy”, or “Unchanged unhealthy” according to baseline and repeat values on dichotomous dietary pattern variables (“unhealthy” defined as Dietary inflammatory index (DII) T3 and Mediterranean diet score (MDS) T1, using sex- and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-specific cut-offs).

Estimates were adjusted for baseline and Δenergy intake, baseline and Δbody mass index (BMI), smoking (non-smoker, ex-smoker, stopped smoking, started smoking, continued smoking), physical activity (unchanged, decreased less activity, more physical activity), and baseline educational status.  All computations were conducted in R v.3.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). All tests were 2-sided, and P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

30,discussion0,"In this prospective, population-based study, the Dietary inflammatory index (DII) and the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) were moderately correlated to each other and produced similar associations with the risk of cancer. An anti-inflammatory or healthier diet was weakly associated with a reduced overall cancer risk, most evident for lung and gastric cancer. Ten-year change in dietary pattern score was not related to cancer risk.  These results are consistent with previously observed positive associations between the inflammatory potential of diet and risk of gastric cancer [21, 22], and the inverse association with a Mediterranean diet [23]. Given the divergent incidence trends for specific subtypes of cancer in the upper gastrointestinal tract [22, 24], further investigation including data on anatomical location of the tumor, histological subtype and Helicobacter pylori infection in relation to diet are warranted [25].",0a913cbd-9c8b-47f1-aad4-6866fa2a4a74
31,discussion1," Our null results for colorectal cancer were surprising, given the wealth of evidence for a role of diet quality in determining risk [23, 26, 27]. Potential associations between diet and any cancer are likely to be mediated in part by body fatness [7]. However, in the present study, “obesity-related cancer”, demonstrated no clear association with dietary indices. Removing body mass index (BMI) from the model did not change the risk estimates and thus, mediation by body fatness is unlikely to entirely explain the null results. Both consumption of foods generally considered unhealthy and total energy intake are underreported to a greater degree by obese compared to non-obese people [28], which might bias potential associations between diet and obesity-related cancers toward the null.  We observed a general association between a more anti-inflammatory/healthier diet and lower risk of lung cancer, consistent with previous findings [6, 23, 29].",0febb098-0100-4dd5-9148-52161ffb0c90
32,discussion2," Effect sizes were similar in men and women, but the association for Dietary inflammatory index (DII) score was statistically significant in men only. A plausible explanation for associations found between the dietary patterns and “smoking-related cancer” in ever smokers might be a synergistic effect of smoking and unhealthy dietary habits that increases low-grade chronic inflammation, as previously shown for lung cancer [30, 31].  The null findings for prostate and breast cancer contrast with results from meta-analyses of Dietary inflammatory index (DII) [6, 23]. However, there is considerable inconsistency in results for dietary patterns in relation to these cancer types in previous studies conducted in Nordic populations [32–34]. For breast cancer, the strong risk conferred by reproductive factors, which we were unable to adjust for, might explain the fairly weak and inconsistent results for the Dietary inflammatory index (DII) [35, 36].",e1312a71-1521-4de3-8a81-a81824e1984d
33,discussion3,"  The study population did not alter its dietary habits substantially according to our supplementary analysis of longitudinal changes in Dietary inflammatory index (DII) and Mediterranean diet score (MDS), which probably explains the fairly consistent results for the longitudinal analyses compared to baseline. Interestingly, a change toward better adherence to the Mediterranean diet score (MDS), was associated with an increased cancer risk, primarily in women. This might be due to residual confounding by socioeconomic status, not sufficiently captured by the education variable. Higher socioeconomic status is a risk factor for breast cancer, probably acting as a summary marker for factors related to reproduction [37]. Diabetes also was disproportionately common among those with healthier diet and reverse causality due to disease-related dietary changes cannot be excluded [38].",6684e8d4-feb6-4abb-9a77-d699ff35e5fa
34,discussion4," However, excluding participants with diabetes in sensitivity analyses in this study had no material effect on the results.  The fifteen Dietary inflammatory index (DII) food parameters lacking in this study are all considered anti-inflammatory, which might limit the ability of the score to capture an anti-inflammatory diet. However, the range of Dietary inflammatory index (DII) scores in our population is similar to a validation study in an American population based on 44 of the 45 components, which showed a direct association with CRP levels [4].  Nutrients and food components with evidence for a relation to cancer risk are largely covered by both Dietary inflammatory index (DII) and Mediterranean diet score (MDS), which undoubtedly contributed to the similar estimates for cancer risk.",86cb4aff-0756-44ea-b251-2cb8921967c0
35,discussion5," Whereas the Dietary inflammatory index (DII) was designed specifically to estimate the inflammatory potential of diet [3], the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) may also capture other mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis, such as reduced free radical production [39] and metabolic function [40]. For example, sugary foods, which can influence blood glucose control and body fatness [40], are considered directly in the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) but are included only in the broader category of carbohydrates in the Dietary inflammatory index (DII). Also, red and processed meats, included in the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) meat component, but not Dietary inflammatory index (DII), with its high content of salt, N-nitroso, heterocyclic amines, and heme iron have all been implicated in carcinogenesis [41]. Although inflammation may be a common factor in our findings and a major player in explaining the link between diet and cancer, other mechanisms also may be involved.",3de2bc60-c9e4-4738-b0bf-04d419f5ffff
36,discussion6,"  A weakness in this study is the self-reported dietary intake, which is subject to recall bias and underreporting. Underreporting of socially undesirable foods has been documented, especially in women [42] and obese people [28], and constitutes a possible bias. However, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s had acceptable reproducibility and a validity similar to food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) measurements in other prospective cohort studies [12–14]. The Dietary inflammatory index (DII) is constructed on a continuous scale, whereas the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) comprises a number of food groups. Thus, approximate tertiles were used to balance between statistical power and dispersion for the specific cancer-sites. The Mediterranean diet score (MDS) used in this study was adapted for the northern Swedish population in this study [19], and it is thus not fully representative of the traditional Mediterranean diet.",19b795f8-9420-4397-92b9-3f4085b51250
37,discussion7," For example, since polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) make up a substantially larger portion of the unsaturated fatty acid intake in the Nordic diet than in the traditional Mediterranean diet [8], the sum of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), rather than monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) alone, was used in the ratio to saturated fat (SFA). Adaptations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) have been successfully applied in various non-Mediterranean populations [43].  Although confounders may differ between cancer types, we applied the same set of covariates in all analyses, in order to simplify interpretation of results. Information about some potential confounders was lacking, such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAID)), of particular relevance for CRC, and menopausal hormone therapy, of relevance for breast cancer. Many types of cancer demonstrate substantial intertumoral heterogeneity.",5e71625f-b326-4454-bfde-a8ae73cdd81e
38,discussion8," More specific anatomic location for cancers of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, as well as tumor characteristics, such as histological subtype for lung and gastric cancer, hormone receptor status for breast cancer, and microsatellite instability and other molecular traits in CRC could, therefore, add valuable information.  A major strength of this study is its prospective design, with over 100,000 participants and up to 26 years of follow-up. Because exposure data were collected before cancer diagnosis, reverse causality and disease-specific recall bias were unlikely to have influenced the results. Furthermore, repeated measures (10-year intervals) were available for over 35,000 participants, allowing investigation of longitudinal dietary changes in relation to cancer risk. Although these analyses were sufficiently powered to examine overall cancer risk, a larger sample size would be necessary for site-specific cancer.",782ec532-59c7-456f-ae76-f749d780e51e
39,discussion9," Additionally, with restricted cubic spline models we could show that most associations were linear. Another important strength is the population-based nature of the cohort used, as demonstrated by the very similar cancer incidence in the Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) and the background population [44], as well as the high participation rate (52–73% over the recruitment period) and the low potential for selection bias [45].  In conclusion, in this prospective cohort study, we confirm small, consistent, and statistically significant associations between a more anti-inflammatory or healthier diet and reduced risk of cancer, for lung and gastric cancer in specific, and particularly in men. Although several mechanisms may be involved, the consistency of the findings for the Dietary inflammatory index (DII), designed specifically to capture the inflammatory impact of diet, and the Mediterranean diet score (MDS), suggests that inflammation may be a common denominator.",570cd8a5-1932-4308-9e26-dcc606fecfb7
