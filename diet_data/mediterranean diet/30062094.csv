0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design The present study is a cross-sectional, descriptive, and quantitative research that has analyzed the adherence to the MD diet in body composition and physical fitness in Estonian adolescents. Deontological standards recognized by the Declaration of Helsinki (revision of Hong Kong in September 1989 and Edinburgh in 2000) were followed and the research was carried out in accordance to the recommendations of Good Clinical Practice of the EEC (document 111/3976/88 of July 1990). In addition, the Ethics Committee of the University of Tartu approved the present study (Ref.: 281/T-10).  2.2. Study Sample The current research included 13 to 16-year-old school students from the city of Tartu (Estonia). To start, 588 participants (326 boys and 265 girls) were selected and, finally, 413 adolescents, 233 boys (56%, Mage = 15.05 ± 1.14 years) and 180 girls (44%, Mage = 15.17 ± 1.08 years) took part in it.",7fc54053-884e-4e19-b74b-de99e78654e4
1,methods1," The students were recruited from three randomly chosen schools in Tartu: Kivilinna Kool (43.8%), Forseliuse Kool (29.1%), and Tamme Kool (27.1%). The inclusion criteria for the current study were: Female and male subjects aged 13 to 16-years-old having submitted the signed informed consent by their parents or tutors. In relation to their health status, the participants were those students who attended Physical Education classes regularly. The participants had no cognitive, physical, or motor limitations. Adolescents were asked for verbal consent, being informed that their participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw from the research at any time.  2.3. Instruments 2.3.1. Adherence to the MD (KIDMED) Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Questionnaire (KIDMED) was used to assess the adherence in adolescents (http://www.aulamedica.es/nh/pdf/9828.pdf) [49].",ef9e8937-721a-40cd-b41a-7e7c4cf59747
2,methods2," The questionnaire, previously validated, consists of 16 items, 12 of them suppose a positive score in relation to the adherence to the MD, and the other 4 suppose a negative score. Affirmative answers to the questions that involve greater adherence to the diet are worth +1 point. Affirmative answers to the questions that suppose fewer adherences to the diet are worth −1 point. KIDMED index is the result of the sum of the scores and ranges from 0 to 12 (minimum to maximum adherence). Adherence to the MD can be classified into three categories: Low adherence: Very low-quality diet (0 to 3 points); average adherence: Improvement of the dietary pattern is needed (4 to 7 points); and high adherence: Optimal MD (8 to 12 points).  2.3.2. Alpha Fitness Test Battery The extended version of the Alpha Fitness test battery (Ref: 2006120) was employed for assessing physical fitness and body composition.",fa136173-6de1-496e-abc4-093b4c9e5bb6
3,methods3," This battery consists of four tests: Handgrip strength test, long jump test, speed-agility, and cardiorespiratory fitness test [50].  The handgrip strength test, using a hand dynamometer with an adjustable fit (TKK 5401 Grip D, Takey, Tokyo, Japan), evaluates the maximum strength of upper extremities. Before the beginning of the test, an assessor showed the correct procedure and how to adjust the dynamometer individually in accordance to the size of the hand of every participant [51]. During the test, the assessor encouraged the participants verbally to “grip as strong as possible” in order to maintain the maximal strength for two seconds. The average result of the two attempts for each hand was recorded.  A long jump test from a standing position was performed in order to analyze the explosive strength of lower extremities. The participants were placed behind the jump line with both feet together realizing an explosive jump covering the longest distance possible.",776cb32e-262a-4830-b2e7-15f3a3862157
4,methods4," The distance was measured from the take-off line point where the back of the heel nearest to the take-off line landed on the ground. The best out of two jumps was recorded.  In order to measure the speed-agility, a 4 × 10 m test was employed. Before the start of the test, an evaluator showed how to run as quickly as possible the 10 m distance between two lines four times. In total, the participants completed two series. The participants realized the test twice being recorded the best time.  A 20 m shuttle test was performed for evaluating cardiorespiratory fitness [52]. During the test, the participants had to cover a distance of 20 m and back, adjusting their running pace to the rhythm of an external acoustic signal (beep). From 8.5 km/h, the running speed increased 0.5 km/h each minute due to a shorter time lap between the beeps.",2da4b173-9894-461a-9cc1-b6cdbd424097
5,methods5," The test was finished when the participants were not able to reach anymore the line for the second time at the same time as the beep, or when they had to stop due to fatigue.  2.3.3. Body Composition The height of the participants was measured using a portable height rod with an accuracy of 0.1 cm (Seca 213, Seca, Hamburg, Germany). The subjects wore light clothing for measuring body weight (with an accuracy of 0.10 kg) and body fat percentage by a bioelectric impedance (Tanita Inner Scan BF-689, Tanita, Tokyo, Japan). The body mass index (body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated from the ratio between body weight (kg) and the height squared of the participants (m2). The waist perimeter (with an accuracy of 0.1 cm) was measured with a non-flexible anthropometric tape measure (Seca 201, Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Waist circumference was measured at the level of the narrowest point between the lowest rib and the iliac crest at the end of a normal exhalation.",a37dae1b-d47c-4c5c-a63b-a702704152c9
6,methods6," In order to classify the participants attending to their body composition parameters, they were classified as Non-Overweight (N-Oweight) or Overweight (Oweight) (regarding their body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI)), Non-Overfat (N-Ofat) or Overfat (Ofat) (related to their fat%), and Non-Overwaist (N-Owaist) or Overwaist (Owaist) (attending to their waist circumference) based on the reference values provided by Moreno et al. [53,54].  2.4. Methodology The Alpha Fitness test battery and the KIDMED questionnaire were completed by all the participants during their physical education classes. The test battery was organized as a circuit and the different tests were performed successively. The cardiorespiratory fitness test was completed by several students at the same time on a different class day. The preparation and the implementation of all the physical tests took 90 min for each group of students.  2.5.",15464633-05fa-438d-a0bd-ec0816da8ab9
7,methods7," Data Analysis The qualitative variables are expressed in frequencies and percentages (%), while the quantitative variables are presented as means (M) and standard deviations (SD). The Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test was performed in order to verify the normality of the variables and the homogeneity of variances by Levene’s test. In order to analyze the adherence to the MD (low, medium, or high), the gender (boys and girls) and the interaction between gender∙adherence to the MD, a multivariate analysis of variance (multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)) was performed, taking as dependent variables the body composition parameters, physical fitness results, and KIDMED and Alpha Fitness index; gender and adherence to the MD were considered fixed factors. In the case of statistically significant differences, a Bonferroni post-hoc test was performed. Additionally, Eta-squared (ηp2) was calculated with <0.25, 0.26–0.63, and >0.",b03268f2-1fc3-47eb-ad12-b4c1dbf60861
8,methods8,"63 considered small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively [55]. For analyzing the adherence to the MD in the prevalence of obesity attending to three criteria (Oweight, Ofat, and Owaist), a Chi-square test was performed. Subsequently, an odd-ratio (OR) was calculated for estimating the risk of overweight based on the adherence to the MD. The level of statistical significance was fixed as p < 0.05. Data analysis was carried out using the SPSS statistical package (version 25.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  3. Results 3.1. Adherence to the MD (KIDMED) No differences in the KIDMED index were found when comparing boys and girls (p = 0.673). When stratifying the whole sample by the level of adherence to the MD, we found that 41.67% of the participants showed low adherence, 44.05% an average adherence level, and 14.28% a high level.  3.2. Alpha Fitness Test Battery Table 1 shows the physical fitness results in relation to gender and level of adherence to the MD in boys and girls.",c571f2f0-723d-4d16-a027-2c15e4471f8e
9,methods10," According to this categorization, the girls show high average values in all the physical fitness variables, except for handgrip, where the average value is classified as medium.  3.3. Body Compositions Table 2 shows the relation between the adherence to the MD and gender regarding body composition parameters. Similarly, as physical fitness variables, statistically significant differences were observed for some of the variables analyzed only for gender (p < 0.05), with the exception of body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI), and no statistically significant results for the adherence to the MD and gender·adherence to the MD in any of the variables analyzed (p > 0.05). Statistically significant differences were found for gender, with higher values in boys vs girls for height (1.74 ± 0.09 vs. 1.65 ± 0.07, p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.996) and weight (66.2 ± 15.29 vs. 59.5 ± 11.77, p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.042).",61508413-f9dd-45cf-98cb-b6796595de06
10,methods11," However, no significant differences were observed for body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.906; ηp2 < 0.001). Moreover, lower values were found in boys vs. girls in body fat percentage (14.68 ± 0.47 vs. 25.21 ± 0.62, p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.310) and higher in waist (78.10 ± 0.66 cm vs. 71.07 ± 2.41 cm, p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.084).  In the analysis based on body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI) (N-Oweight and Oweight) (Table 3), a trend to significance was observed only in boys (p = 0.053), since it is a risk factor to have a low-level vs. mid-level of adherence to the MD (OR = 1.69 [1.03–2.79]). As for waist measurements (N-Owaist and Owaist), a trend toward significant differences in boys (p = 0.098) was also observed, although there was no risk factor for Owaist based on the level of adherence to the MD. No statistically significant differences were observed in relation to the fat % (N-Ofat, and Ofat) for the total sample, boys and girls (p > 0.05).",6e92e012-b183-4e49-a51b-52d953593215
11,methods12," Moreover, no statistically significant differences for the total sample and for the girls in N-Oweight vs. Oweight and N-Owaist vs. Owaist were found.   4. Discussion The current research is the first to analyze the levels of adherence to the MD in adolescent school students in Estonia, and its associations with physical fitness and body composition in a sample of male and female adolescents. The data from the KIDMED questionnaire (low 41.6%, average 44.05%, and high adherence to the MD, 14.28%) provide notably lower results than those of studies conducted in Mediterranean countries [56,57], but similar to those of studies carried out in non-Mediterranean countries [19]. In turn, the results obtained in the current study match those found by similar studies in southern European countries [20,58,59], with a comparable percentage in subjects with a medium adherence to the MD, but with higher results in those who presented a low adherence to the MD.",1b76ffd8-7b19-4178-8ee0-b588c9b5ae32
12,methods13," However, the adherence is inferior in comparison to the results of a recent study by Galan-Lopez et al., conducted in Icelandic adolescents, and where 14.99% of low adherence was found, 60.72% of mild adherence, and 24.29% of high adherence [24]. In agreement with the results obtained by Ozen et al., which exhibited important differences in relation to a high and a low adherence in the population analyzed, with a clear trend to abandon the MD [60], the results found in the current research show a tendency to decrease the patterns related to the MD, since the average and low adhesion quantify more than 85% of the participating population. In addition, as in previous studies, there is no difference in adherence to the MD according to gender [20,24,61]. Moreover, similar to different studies, there is no difference between levels of adherence to the MD related to gender.",9b49f1aa-efed-4d21-a008-868076befc3e
13,methods14,"  When analyzing the results of the different physical tests of the Alpha Fitness battery by gender, it can be confirmed that there are differences in all the Alpha Fitness variables, with higher scores for the boys. These results are in line with those found in several studies with a similar population, in which a better performance was observed in the tests of handgrip strength, long jump, speed-agility, and cardiorespiratory fitness in boys with respect to girls [62,63,64,65]. In addition, in the analysis of body fat, a higher percentage of body fat was observed in girls (25.01% vs. 14.68%, p < 0.001), so the higher levels of lean body mass in the boys explain a higher ability to attain higher levels of strength, speed, and cardiorespiratory fitness [66], although this could also be due to a higher level of physical inactivity or sedentarism in girls, a fundamental determinant of NCDs [29]. Similar to the research conducted by Galán-López et al.",04631e9b-2afe-4edf-9041-7cde5414af20
14,methods15,", the current research presents a novel aspect [24], since it compares the results of the tests of health-related physical fitness and level of adherence to the MD, seeking possible associations. Significant differences were observed in the performances in the tests, but there were no significant differences when relating the same result with the level of adherence to the MD, coinciding with what was found by Galan-Lopez et al. [61].  Once the variables of the body composition of the participants were calculated, significant differences were observed between boys and girls in weight, height, % of body fat, and waist circumference. These results are similar to those obtained in several studies with adolescent populations, in which the girls showed higher levels of adiposity, whereas the boys presented higher results in weight, height, and waist circumference [24,67,68,69].",79c1d583-149b-4695-ae95-e3c2cd493e23
15,methods16," Furthermore, it is necessary to highlight that, although there are differences in the variables of weight, height, body fat percentage, and waist circumference, the values of these variables, in addition to those related to body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI), are classified as average values based on the levels established by Moreno et al. [53,54]. Contrary to what was found in the AVENA study [70], the participants of the current research do not suffer from obesity, since the values of body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and percentage of body fat are classified as mean values. Furthermore, the data concerning the weight of the population are similar to the reference values for European adolescents provided in the HELENA study [71].",6f51f492-dddc-47fe-917f-892cbf1a409a
16,methods17,"  In contrast to what is reflected in several recent studies, which have found a direct relationship between adherence to the MD, weight, and body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI) of the subjects [21,72], as well as waist circumference [73], our study does not show any association between the level of adherence to the MD and the body composition parameters.  On the other hand, there is growing evidence that health behaviors are grouped. During adolescence, a healthy diet combined with regular physical activity increases the likelihood of a healthy pattern of constant physical maturation [18]. In addition, there are independent and combined associations between physical fitness, physical activity, body composition, and adherence to the MD with HRQoL in children, adolescents, and adults [15,19,20,21,22], and with significant improvements in joint interventions [23,24,25].",be18ba5a-66b2-4d9f-bbdc-e95a423c337b
17,methods18,"  A correct evaluation and control of physical activity, body composition, and dietary habits that are more determinant for health in these stages, is fundamental, even more so when the process in these ages is considered reversible [74]. In addition, habits can both prevent or reduce the risk factors associated with NCDs by implementing a healthy lifestyle [75]. The current research highlights the importance of developing and maintaining healthy physical fitness habits, as well as improving and maintaining dietary patterns focused on the MD, since, together, both result in a better HRQoL at these ages.  The cross-sectional design of the current study has limitations, since the conclusions should not be attributed to plausible causes, but they can be used as valuable indications to be taken into account for future research. In addition, the data collected (KIDMED) were self-reported, which could lead to an error in the reports and recall due to the nature of the study.  5.",a83324cf-0d17-4239-b96b-0312495e7d96
18,methods19," Conclusions As a novel aspect, this article is the first to analyze the adherence to the MD in relation to the variables of physical fitness and body composition in Estonian adolescents.  The adolescents who participated in this research show medium levels of physical fitness, with higher results for the boys. The participants’ adherence to the MD is classified as average/low. Gender significantly influences all variables of Alpha Fitness battery and anthropometrics measures, except body composition parameters (body mass index (BMI).  No statistically significant difference in prevalence was observed for N-Oweight, N-Ofat, or N-Owaist in relation to adherence to the MD. Nevertheless, a risk factor for Oweight in boys with low adherence was observed in comparison to those with a mid-level of adherence. ",b0c06711-e16a-4ce2-854e-c33035a7afe3
