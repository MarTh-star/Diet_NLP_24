0,abstract0,"  The nutritional status of reproductive-aged couples can have a significant impact on fertility status, but the effect of dietary patterns on pregnancy outcomes in people using assisted reproductive technologies (assisted reproductive technology (ART)s) is currently unknown. This review aimed to synthesize the published research investigating the relation between preconception dietary patterns and clinical pregnancy or live birth in men and women of reproductive age undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART). Six electronic databases were systematically searched for original research published between January 1978 and June 2021. Original research reporting on the effect of predefined dietary patterns on either clinical pregnancy and/or live birth rates following in vitro fertilization (in vitro fertilization (IVF)) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)) in men and women aged 18–49 y was eligible for inclusion.",90765232-b5b0-4864-9bb2-314bb2eacac3
1,abstract1," Studies were assessed for risk of bias according to the Cochrane guidelines. Included studies underwent qualitative and quantitative synthesis using random-effects model meta-analyses. Thirteen studies (12 cohort studies, 1 randomized controlled trial) reporting on 3638 participants (93% female) were included in the review. All studies had a moderate–high risk of bias. In individual studies, maternal adherence to 4 dietary patterns [Mediterranean diet (RR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.43), novel profertility diet (OR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.72), Iranian traditional medicine diet (OR: 3.9; 95% CI: 1.2, 12.8), Dutch national dietary recommendations diet (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.52)] was associated with increased likelihood of achieving a clinical pregnancy, while 2 dietary patterns [novel profertility diet (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.26, 1.85), Mediterranean diet (RR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.45)] were associated with increased probability of live birth.",91296fb8-742f-4211-8af0-fcc90880f1d8

As the relation between dietary patterns and assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes is currently inconsistent, higher-quality nutrition research is required to further explore this emerging field of interest (Preactive oxygen species (ROS)PERO registration: CRD42020188194).

The inability to successfully conceive a child or carry a pregnancy to term can have devastating long-term social, psychological, and financial consequences for infertile couples (2). It is estimated that up to 15% of all couples of reproductive age worldwide suffer from infertility (3).",2aefe7b0-e69c-4f34-bac8-abd57b25f65e
4,abstract4," Male factor infertility contributes to 20–30% of all infertility cases, while female factor infertility may be the sole factor in up to 30% of cases, and approximately 30% of cases are of unknown etiology or are attributable to a combination of male and female factors (1, 4).  Infertile couples are increasingly utilizing assisted reproductive technology (assisted reproductive technology (ART)) to improve their chances of conception (5). assisted reproductive technology (ART) is the collective term that describes the medical and pharmacological methods used to treat infertility and includes in vitro fertilization (in vitro fertilization (IVF)) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)). As only approximately 30–40% of couples attempting assisted reproductive technology (ART) will achieve a live birth with each treatment cycle (6), researchers continue to investigate complementary factors that may increase the likelihood of successful outcomes.",cfeb4923-ab5a-4045-bf5e-8ce40e4958bb
5,abstract5,"  Over the last decade, there has been increased scientific interest in the effect of modifiable preconception dietary and lifestyle factors on assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes (7). As dietary intake of specific micronutrients can influence the concentration of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in both follicular and seminal fluid, achieving an optimal maternal and paternal nutritional intake prior to and during assisted reproductive technology (ART) has been hypothesized to potentiate reproductive success (8, 9). Recent research has found some associations between nutritional intake and both positive and negative clinical outcomes of assisted reproductive technology (ART).",a7879f60-56e8-46e2-a827-7c6455d58c4a
6,abstract6," Nutrients associated with improved fertility in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) include folic acid (10), vitamin D (in cases of deficiency) (11), and omega-3 PUFAs (12), while nutritional factors such as overweight and obesity (13), and the overconsumption of trans fat (14), sugar (15) and environmental toxins such as pesticides and heavy metals (16), are associated with reduced fertility following assisted reproductive technology (ART). The impact of alcohol and caffeine intake in both men and women during assisted reproductive technology (ART) remains contradictory (17). A higher dietary antioxidant intake in males undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) has frequently been associated with improved sperm characteristics (18, 19), but some trials providing antioxidant supplements to men undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) have found no such improvements (20).",c9492b46-a804-446f-9f38-dc0260182605
7,abstract7,"  Typically, studies that have examined the relation between diet and assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes have focused on single nutrients and supplements rather than whole dietary patterns. Most studies have been conducted in small sample sizes, and many have only measured in vitro intermediate outcomes of fertility status (sperm count, sperm quality, oocyte quality) rather than patient-important primary outcomes such as clinical pregnancy and/or live birth. In addition, many trials involving nutritional supplementation provide a combination of different dietary compounds (antioxidants, vitamins, or other nutrients) simultaneously at a wide range of dosages, making it difficult to compare studies or combine similar studies to achieve greater statistical power (21).",636133b6-f283-4d3a-83cb-05005924b527
8,abstract8," The intake of individual nutrients is likely to have limited relevance to the study of assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes because people consume whole foods and diets that contain a highly complex combination of nutrients and anti-nutrients, which interact to either enhance or impair the absorption of numerous dietary components. Dietary patterns are now the focus of increasing research efforts, and it is important that the diet as a whole is considered when examining its impact on health outcomes.  This review aims to synthesize the body of published research investigating the relation between preconception dietary patterns and clinical pregnancy and/or live birth outcomes in men and women of reproductive age undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), to determine whether an optimal dietary pattern for assisted reproductive technology (ART) can be identified.",0e48e118-6706-4ee7-8661-6ffd8255d990

10,methods0," Eligibility criteria, information sources, search strategy  This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA) (22) and was registered with the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (Preactive oxygen species (ROS)PERO; registration number CRD42020188194) on 5 July 2020.  This review sought articles from the following research databases: Ovid Medline, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The databases were searched for literature published between 1 January 1978 to 1 June 2021. January 1978 was selected as the start date for the literature search as this was the year of the first live birth resulting from in vitro fertilization (IVF) (23).  Eligible study designs included observational, cross-sectional, cohort, clinical trial, and randomized clinical trials.",899014c9-e5e8-4ad1-a76c-1d5890c84de4
11,methods1," Eligible participants included both males and females, aged 18–49 y, who were undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Studies were required to assess dietary patterns via prospective collection of dietary intake data using FFQs or via retrospective dietary recall methods and stratification into specific dietary patterns. Primary outcomes considered important for the purposes of this review were rates of clinical or biochemical pregnancy and/or live birth following assisted reproductive technology (ART).",4c10168a-1c5c-4cd8-9958-177577a42329

13,methods3," The search was then limited to studies in human participants, and those published in English. An example of the search strategy used is included in Supplemental Table 1.  Studies were excluded if their primary analysis concerned consumption of individual foods, food groups, vitamins, or minerals, as opposed to dietary patterns. Studies that examined proxy estimates of fertility status such as sperm or oocyte morphology, quality, or quantity were not included because these outcomes often correlate poorly with pregnancy and live birth rates. Ecological and in vitro study designs were not included. Studies that specifically recruited women with conditions associated with subfertility such as polycystic ovarian syndrome or endometriosis were excluded. However, studies involving large numbers of reproductive-aged women (which may have included some women with these conditions) were included in this review.",6e360c01-41d9-4f37-9ed9-938ad98c451d

Study selection  All references resulting from the search process were collated and uploaded to Endnote (version 9.2; Clarivate Analytics). Following removal of duplicate manuscripts, all remaining studies were imported into the Covidence screening software (Covidence Systematic Review Software; Veritas Health Innovation). All articles underwent title and abstract screening, with included articles then progressing to full-text screening. Both the title and abstract and the full-text screening were independently completed by 2 authors (NJK, JLC). Conflicts that arose in each screening phase were resolved by discussion between these authors until consensus was achieved.  Data extraction  Data extraction was undertaken following full-text screening.",4b750633-8ae3-441e-b8cb-d435341cf08e

One author conducted the data extraction (NJK), which was then verified by a second author (JLC).  Risk-of-bias assessment  Risk-of-bias assessment was undertaken independently by 2 authors (NJK, JLC). Cohort studies were assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies–of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool (24). This tool identifies potential biases within studies based on a set of 7 domains, including confounding, selection of participants, classification of interventions, deviation from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement bias, and selection of reported result.",0936de5f-7d96-40d3-856e-6473eba70c9d
16,methods6," The risk of bias for each study was classified as either “no information,” “low risk,” “moderate risk,” “serious risk,” or “critical risk.” The randomized controlled trial (randomized controlled trial (RCT)) was assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2.0 tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0) (25). This tool evaluates potential biases within studies based on a set of 5 domains, including bias arising from the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, incomplete outcome data, outcome measurement bias and selective reporting of results. Risk of bias for the randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designated as either “low risk,” “some concerns,” or “high risk.” Inconsistencies between the reviewer's risk-of-bias assessments at the study level were resolved through discussion until consensus was reached.",15b983cf-2068-42b4-af7b-ba8c0ec45c61
17,methods7,"  Data synthesis  Where studies assessed clinical pregnancy and live birth outcomes with consumption of similar dietary patterns, that dietary pattern was subjected to random-effects model meta-analyses using Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.1; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014, Copenhagen, Denmark). Due to limited concordance between the various scoring systems used to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet (26), only studies using the same adherence assessment tool were pooled for analysis. ORs were determined for each outcome with 95% CIs, either where the highest category of adherence was compared with the lowest category of adherence (reference group) or where the highest category of adherence was determined to be the reference group. Data were collected from the model that adjusted for the highest number of potential confounders.",014bbf7e-d7f0-4073-99c0-cb4e765287eb

Although primarily focused on data collection from female study participants, 2 studies also collected dietary information from male partners (38, 39). Twelve of the 13 studies used a prospective cohort study design, while Alibeigi and colleagues (27) conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial (prospectively registered in the Iranian Center for Clinical Trials, code no.

Members of the intervention group were also able to attend a virtual discussion/support group (which was not offered to control participants). Because there were no significant differences in macro- and micronutrient intakes between intervention and control groups, the substantial nondietary lifestyle recommendations associated with the Iranian traditional medicine diet may have positively influenced the outcome.",5826cdb3-c23d-4e9d-89d9-c7d4a0f38bd3
63,discussion3," Among other lifestyle guidelines, the intervention group was encouraged to avoid exposure to pollution, exercise regularly, manage stress, obtain sufficient sleep, and avoid overeating. Additionally, the strict nature of the diet may preclude its use outside of Iran. Forbidden foods such as tuna, pasta, lentils, beef, canned fruit, iced water, cucumber, and mushrooms may be difficult for some individuals to avoid.  Common features of the dietary patterns identified, including the novel profertility diet, the Dutch national dietary recommendations diet, and the Mediterranean diet, may help to explain why adherence to these eating patterns could be beneficial for fertility. The focus of these diets is on minimally processed fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, fish, and monounsaturated or polyunsaturated oils, while intakes of highly processed foods are limited.",3af8e0c8-aaf2-4390-8858-7d51e406b490
64,discussion4," The diets are high in B-vitamins (including folate), antioxidants, omega-3 PUFAs, and dietary fiber and low in saturated fat, sugar, and sodium. Health benefits associated with the consumption of these diets include improvements in metabolic health, lower levels of inflammation and oxidative stress, healthier body weight, and increased diversity of the gut microbiota. Similar metabolic implications are associated with decreased sedentary activity (42) and increased sleep (43). An increased antioxidant profile, achieved by consuming a minimally processed diet, is more readily able to defend against exposure to excessive reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), which can exert deleterious effects on contributors to both male and female reproductive health, including decreased sperm quality and DNA integrity (44) and poorer quality oocytes (45).",01b1d69f-5511-4c2c-a38d-e55600e310fd
65,discussion5," In contrast, Jahangirifar and colleagues (31) found an association between maternal adherence to an “unhealthy dietary pattern” and reduced odds of clinical pregnancy during assisted reproductive technology (ART). Benefits or detrimental effects of diet on reproductive health are unlikely to be derived from a single feature of these diets, but from the collective contribution of multiple dietary components and other lifestyle factors.  While high fruit and vegetable intakes were a prominent feature of the dietary patterns associated with increased frequencies of clinical pregnancy and live birth in this review, vitamin and mineral supplementation was also widespread in the included studies. Only the studies by Gaskins et al. (30) and Karyiannis et al.",a25e9914-911b-433c-bfef-e2036d32b333
66,discussion6," (32) considered the full range and frequency of nutritional supplements taken by study participants in their analyses, with both finding that increased adherence to fertility-promoting dietary patterns was positively associated with increasing nutritional supplement intake. While almost all studies in this review used routine maternal folic acid supplementation, individuals with the highest adherence to the novel profertility diet consumed supplements containing much higher doses of folic acid than are currently recommended for the prevention of neural tube defects (30). Folic acid supplementation of at least 800 μg/d has been associated with a higher probability of live birth in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), likely due to higher fertilization rates and lower cycle failure rates prior to embryo transfer (10).",f739f0d5-1432-456f-a399-1b03db64bf0f
67,discussion7,"  The consumption of whole grains, dietary fiber, and a low-GL diet has been associated with increased fecundability in women attempting pregnancy (46), as well as increased endometrium thickness, embryo implantation, and live birth in women receiving in vitro fertilization (IVF) (47). Gaskins et al. (30) found that carbohydrate intake was significantly increased across quartiles with increasing adherence to their novel profertility diet, which may have indicated an increased dietary fiber intake across quartiles. One study (34) included in this review investigated the association between consumption of a low-GI and low-GL diet and clinical pregnancy and live birth rates during assisted reproductive technology (ART) but found no significant relations. A limitation of this study was that the authors calculated dietary GI values based on maternal consumption of carbohydrate-containing foods only, which does not consider the effect of other nutrients such as fat on the GI of mixed meals.",25dfa057-d3aa-44df-88f1-7e57e42b6bb8
68,discussion8,"  Discrepancies in the outcomes of the studies investigating associations between maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet and clinical pregnancy/live birth could be explained by the range of different dietary adherence scoring tools utilized. Gaskins et al. (30) and Karayiannis et al. (32) used the MedDietScore (48) (score: 0–55), Ricci et al. (35) and Sun et al. (37) used the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with modifications (49) (score: 0–9), and Vujkovic and colleagues (39) used an FFQ with principal component analysis to calculate and assign dietary pattern adherence scores. Variations between these scoring systems and differences in their food group classifications make them very difficult to compare. While statistically significant, the agreement between the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the MedDietScore is considered to be only moderate (65%) (50).",32af4252-6358-49ff-a467-c45b772115fa
69,discussion9,"  Health benefits associated with the consumption of the Mediterranean diet may be less pronounced in populations living in non-Mediterranean countries, due to differences in the nutrient composition and agricultural or processing methods of foods grown in the region combined with variations in genetic or microbial profiles of populations between countries. Furthermore, the beneficial nondietary components of the Mediterranean lifestyle, including social interaction and adequate sleep and physical activity, may not be replicated in non-Mediterranean countries (51).  While the studies identified in this review explore dietary patterns, a theme emerged regarding environmental pollutants. In the novel profertility diet there was a unique focus on reducing pesticide consumption (30). Over 105 pesticides, either previously or currently in use, have been identified as having endocrine-disruptive properties in humans (52).",45a8cd1a-9deb-490b-a30d-7ef862dc9012
70,discussion10," In a US prospective cohort study, male consumption of high-pesticide fruit and vegetables was associated with poorer semen quality, lower sperm count, and lower percentage of morphologically normal sperm compared with men with the lowest intakes (53). Further research to determine the potential impact of high-pesticide fruit and vegetable intake on clinical fertility outcomes is required.  Interestingly, Braga et al. (28, 29) found a negative association between self-reported “adherence to a weight-loss diet” and the likelihood of achieving clinical pregnancy in both male and female participants (although no assessment of the quality of the weight-loss diets was undertaken). Weight loss for those who live in a larger body is considered by many experts to be best practice (54). However, the results of Braga et al. are supported by a recent review that identified that there may be little to no benefit of weight loss before assisted reproductive technology (ART) (54).",89277c53-7f63-4aff-86b7-ab7ebb3db7de
71,discussion11," Further, this practice may be considered discriminatory as it reduces the accessibility of treatment based on body weight (54).  Strengths and limitations  While this review synthesized data exploring the association between dietary patterns and assisted reproductive technology (ART)-assisted pregnancy and live birth from a large number of individuals (n = 3638), only 7% of study participants were male, so the findings of this review cannot be applied to men. The quality of the male partners’ diet could potentially contribute to the success of reproductive outcomes during assisted reproductive technology (ART), but the lack of available dietary pattern data for males in this review prevents any conclusions being made on this topic.",22837e3c-89bb-4959-91c4-b50717bdd5b5
72,discussion12," Additionally, most studies reported fertility outcomes for both in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures combined, so it was impossible to determine whether particular dietary patterns were preferentially beneficial for in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) individually.  Conclusions and implications  Future research in this field should seek to utilize similar, validated dietary assessment tools to enable comparability between studies. Quantification of dietary intake should be repeated at regular intervals throughout extended cohort studies to capture significant dietary changes. Analyses should ideally include adjustment for maternal age and BMI, total energy intake, and the dose and frequency of nutritional supplement use.",b70ff833-918b-4f08-be9d-a7abdbbbd47c
73,discussion13," Only 1 (28) of the 13 studies included in this review principally explored the association between the male partner's diet and clinical assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes (7% of primary study participants were male). Given that men with the lowest adherence to a healthy dietary pattern have been found to have significantly lower sperm counts (55) and sperm motility (56, 57), more studies are required to investigate the influence of the male's dietary patterns on clinical pregnancy and live birth outcomes. Importantly, male fertility is an equal contributor to the reproductive success of couples; however, the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has become a popular adjunctive treatment for alleviating male factor infertility without resolving the underlying cause of infertility. The scarcity of research addressing the relation between male dietary patterns and infertility needs to be addressed.",8360c4c9-6b5a-42c6-a717-244f6ffa86c9
74,discussion14,"  This review has identified certain dietary patterns that may be capable of positively influencing clinical outcomes of fertility treatment. Based on the current body of evidence, however, the association between dietary patterns and assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes is inconsistent. High-quality studies are required to further elucidate the association between dietary patterns and clinical assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes.
