0,background0,"Tumor suppressor genes, such as breast cancer (BRCA)1 and 2, are important regulators for suppressing tumor development. Women with highly penetrant BRCA mutations have a lifetime risk of 55–60% for breast cancer and 16–59% for ovarian cancer [1, 2]. Penetrance rates vary because of endogenous factors, such as gene polymorphisms, as well as exogenous factors, such as the number of pregnancies, year of birth, and physical activity during youth [3, 4]. The risk for breast cancer is lower if genotype carriers were born before 1940, gave birth, or were physically active during their youth [5, 6].  Prospective studies have revealed that regular physical activity can significantly reduce breast cancer incidence in post- and premenopausal women, the risk being reduced on average by 25% [7]. Furthermore, the risks of recurrence and mortality in women with breast cancer are reduced by 50% if they engage in regular physical activity [8].",722afdd2-ed4a-4d2e-8952-f8afc87556e2
1,background1," Further advantages of physical activity include a gain in quality of life, increased fitness, and improved tolerance of chemotherapy [9].  Nutrition also influences the risk of breast cancer. Obesity and weight gain increase the risk of breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal subjects [10, 11]. A weight gain of more than 20 kg after the age of 18 doubles the risk of breast cancer. Furthermore, women with a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) of >30 kg/m2 have a greater risk of developing distant metastases and early mortality [12]. In a prospective study with sporadic breast cancer on patients under adjuvant standard therapy, a calorie and fat-reduced nutrition program led to a significant reduction in recurrence rates [13].  Further risk factors for breast cancer include depression, a pessimistic outlook on life, and problems in coping with stress [14, 15].",1fa65063-be01-46a1-8f76-07af66a75858
2,background2," Numerous studies have overwhelmingly documented the substantial significance of an optimistic life perspective for different psychological and somatic disorders [16]. A positive association was shown between an optimistic outlook on life and psychological well-being, health, stress reduction, and mortality, as well as improved recovery rates [17–19].  So far, no studies have been performed prospectively assessing lifestyle intervention in women with hereditary breast cancer or women with a deleterious BRCA mutation. Even retrospective data analysis is rare. There is currently only one publication on this subject by Manders et al. in 2011 [20], which reports on an association between increased body weight and an increased risk for breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.",3ac97cc8-c6de-4a33-9f55-112ae5e00b08
3,background3,"  Therefore, we aim to perform a large randomized intervention trial assessing whether a long-term multifactorial lifestyle intervention program, including (1) a structured physical endurance training, (2) nutritional counseling stressing the Mediterranean dietary pattern, and (3) stress coping strategies, will lead to a reduction in breast cancer incidence and mortality in BRCA1 and 2 mutation carriers (Lifestyle Intervention Study in Women with Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (LIBRE)). Before this large trial can be started, we will execute a feasibility study (LIBRE-pilot), which is outlined here. This smaller trial with 60 patients will evaluate whether women will be compliant and will sufficiently adhere to a demanding intervention program. Based on the results of this first pilot trial, we aim to set up a subsequent larger trial to investigate the efficacy of the intervention on clinical endpoints.",59a14077-0ab9-4bf5-843f-cd1d72daf646

The first 3 months includes intensive (regular) contact with physical activity and nutritional education sessions. The learned strategies will then be maintained and monitored in the following 9 months through monthly contacts and meetings. The lifestyle intervention program comprises the following measures: Physical activity: The LIBRE training program is primarily an endurance-oriented training, which will be completed in the course of 1 year.",ec6c32ef-1cda-463d-baff-efeb24146b09
11,methods6," After a mandatory introductory lecture on the theory behind the intervention training, the goal is to increase physical activity to ≥18 MET*h/week (MET = metabolic equivalent task). One MET is equivalent to resting energy expenditure, so multiple METs express exercise intensity that is performed over a certain time, e.g., hours per week. 18 MET*h/week is approximately equivalent to brisk walking (4.5 MET) for 4 h per week. This activity level has been correlated consistently with a reduction of morbidity and mortality in breast cancer patients [8, 21]. This goal should be achieved within the first 12 weeks and maintained throughout the whole study period. Each subject will receive an individual training plan, which will continuously be adapted according to her fitness status.",4d20fa4d-54c5-4fce-98f1-6aa763374357

In the first 12 weeks of the intervention program, training will take place twice a week as supervised training and once a week as home-based training (home based training (HBT)). Afterwards, supervised training units will only be carried out monthly, so that training in months 4–12 will be mainly home based training (HBT). Training will continue to take place with an intensity of at least 60–75% of the VO2 peak in accordance with the individual training plan.  A record of compliance with the training intervention program as well as the achieved MET*h/week will be kept in the training diaries (questionnaire on physical activity, V0–V2).",2a1d48c5-acb7-4d46-b5ae-f549bd8cb6db

The training intensity levels will then be assessed by spiroergometry and outlined in the diary, which facilitates training control. Monthly supervised training units (as of V1) offer the opportunity to realign training intensity and discuss any problems with adherence to training. In addition, physical activity is to be recorded using questionnaires (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [22, 23] from V0 to V2), motion sensors (accelerometer from SE to V2), and a physical fitness assessment by cardiopulmonary exercise testing by spiroergometry (VO2 peak) [24] at time points SE, V1, and V2.   Nutrition: Within the framework of the LIBRE-1 study, the nutrition intervention is based on the principles of a Mediterranean dietary pattern (MD).",dcda26ac-89d5-4fc8-85ad-278c99c49556

Nutrition intervention in the IG consists of an intensive phase of 3 months in line with the intensive physical exercise program. During this phase, bi-weekly nutrition education group courses will be held by dietitians. They include a cooking class and guided tour of a supermarket. Afterwards, nutrition courses will be reduced to monthly intervals. The main objective of the nutrition intervention is to provide practical nutritional training, which should enable the subjects to achieve a long-term change in their eating habits, replacing it with the MD.

We hypothesize that regular physical activity and the implementation of healthy nutrition (IG) can lead to a more optimistic attitude to life.  Measurement of chronic stress [39] The SSCS by trier inventory on chronic stress is a 12-item (short version) questionnaire, which measures five different aspects of chronic stress: lack of social recognition, pressure of business, social stress, chronic anxiety, and overstrain [39].  Measurement of attitudes and views on physical exercise and healthy eating (BKAE, 18 items) One of the main intentions of the present LIBRE study is to investigate the practicability of the intervention program in the sense of good compliance of mutation carriers towards an exercise program and Mediterranean diet.",c40167c6-38e3-4491-bad8-30b592bf6ac2
28,methods23," In order to understand how different factors may influence compliance, measurements of subjective parameters are needed (such as attitudes towards a behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavior control), which represent a necessary link between objective factors (age and other demographics, stage of disease, comorbid conditions, treatments, stress pressure, daily hassles, etc.) and intentions related to behavior as well behavior itself (doing sports and keeping a specific diet). According to the theory of planned behavior (see Fishbein and Ajzen [40]), the intentions related to behavior result from an interplay between attitudes towards a behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavior control. The theory of Fishbein and Ajzen was applied in the last years in many studies which dealt with health psychology (e.g.",6ee3af06-ef20-4400-b01a-17168dffb742
29,methods24,", surgery intentions, food adherence, and physical activity behavior among others) and represents one of the well-proven ways to investigate subjective mechanisms of compliance [41–44]. In the context of the Fishbein and Ajzen [40] model, the study may answer the following questions: (1) Which are the predictors of regular participation in the preventive measures (exercise, nutrition)? (2) To which degree are attitudes, subjective norms, or perceived behavior control towards a behavior relevant for the intention of behavior (i.e., to train regularly and to eat healthy) and for the de facto behavior shown?  Study endpoints The primary endpoint of the study is the number of randomized women who successfully complete the first 3 months of the intervention program and the monitoring/maintenance phase after 1 year.

Since the patients in the intervention arm will be given a strict and intensely structured intervention program, the purpose first is to assess the feasibility of the study design in a multicenter setting including 60 female mutation carriers. We are aware that the study protocol is time-consuming and demanding for the patients including regular exercise and changes in nutritional habits but believe it necessary to cover/investigate all relevant factors.

In addition, randomized controlled intervention studies have revealed that it is effective in the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [45], in improving diabetes [46] and cognitive function [47], and recently also in the primary prevention of invasive breast cancer [48].  Once compliance and acceptance of the study protocol have been proven (LIBRE-1), we will proceed with a larger cohort of mutation carriers with the intention to investigate whether the improvement of physical fitness, body weight, quality of life, and stress coping capacity leads to a reduction of breast cancer risk, progression of disease, and even mortality.",cb7f82c5-f994-4cc8-a28c-9d571844bcc7

The current feasibility study will also reveal barriers to and constraints of the intervention, which will then have to be modified for the larger clinical trial.  One of the foreseen limitations of the trial will be selection bias for those patients being interested in lifestyle intervention and for those who will be randomized to usual care, especially for highly motivated participants. The latter patients may be disappointed on being assigned to the control arm and might either withdraw from the study or follow exercise instructions from the IG. These biases cannot be excluded in any lifestyle intervention trial.

36,discussion3," In addition, physical fitness will be objectively assessed by spiroergometry in both arms, which will also yield information on the long-term involvement of physical activity.  On the other hand, restraints for less motivated patients, e.g., due to professional obligations or as cares for children or other family members, may have an impact on adherence to supervised exercise sessions and everyday physical activities. In addition, a cross-over from CG to IG group for the Mediterranean dietary pattern cannot be excluded as previously outlined for physical activity. However, nutritional habits will also be assessed by questionnaire and body mass index (BMI) and body composition measured in both groups. Because of these problems in lifestyle intervention trials, it is a clear aim to avoid cross-over or bias of investigations by assuring that patients be treated identically regardless of the group assignment.",97f0d298-1523-4456-a985-5524765a87ff
37,discussion4,"  This LIBRE initiative (pilot and clinical study) will have the potential to reveal whether a structured lifestyle intervention program may prevent tumor incidence in BRCA mutation carriers. This will have to be compared with current risk-reducing strategies for women at risk, including prophylactic mastectomy, and could then be added to early detection programs. Furthermore, by following a structured exercise program and dietary changes, mutation carriers will attain an independent and self-governed role in cancer prevention and successfully reduce their stress levels [39]. By improving and optimizing the latter, we expect a preventive health effect not only on a somatic but also on the mental status of these patients.",c4f2e016-0ff9-44f2-8f49-1e6da71b01ad
