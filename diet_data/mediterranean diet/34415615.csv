4,introduction0," The European population is ageing rapidly with 90.5 million older adults (aged 65 years or older) living within the European Union in 2019 and expected to increase to 129.8 million by 2050 (Eurostat, 2020). A key public health challenge of this ageing population is to ensure citizens remain healthy and disability‐free for as long as possible (World Health Organization, 2019). Dementia is a major public health challenge of ageing particularly given its recognised impact on disability among older adults (World Health Organization, 2017). Approximately 9.1 million people are living with dementia in Europe, and this figure is expected to rise to 14.2 million by 2040 (OECD/European Union, 2018).  Undernutrition—defined as a state resulting from inadequate food intake and/or nutrient deficiencies that lead to an altered body composition and weight loss (Cederholm et al., 2015)—is common among older adults with cognitive impairment (Volkert et al., 2015).",e1af0445-5ccf-4ae2-924c-5bbff6d81f22
5,introduction1," Alzheimer's Disease International suggests that 20%–45% of community‐dwelling people with dementia experience clinically significant weight loss (Prince et al., 2014). Undernourished dementia patients experience faster functional and cognitive decline and greater risk of hospitalisation and death, compared with those who are adequately nourished (Spaccavento et al., 2009; Soto et al., 2012; Sanders et al., 2018). Systematic review evidence suggests that annual weight loss greater than or equal to 0.5% is associated with increased dementia risk of 30%–40% (Lee et al., 2020). Although it is possible the association may have arisen through reverse causality, the weight loss precedes a diagnosis of cognitive impairment or dementia by at least one decade (Knopman, 2007; LeBlanc et al., 2016), thus potentially providing a window of opportunity to intervene with strategies to counteract undernutrition, and a potential to delay, or prevent, the onset of dementia in later life.",5ca56dc6-c76e-436a-b24e-a8a780eb9ca0
6,introduction2,"  Relatively, little is known about the mechanisms underpinning undernutrition and dementia (Sergi et al., 2013). Undernutrition has been implicated in the pathway from inflammaging to many chronic diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases (Norman et al., 2021). Furthermore, neurodegenerative processes leading to dementia begin years before clinical features become apparent (Blazer et al., 2015) and induce physiological and behavioural changes, beyond normal ageing, that can alter nutritional status. Changes may include but are not limited to altered inflammatory response (McGrattan et al., 2019), dysregulation of satiety and gut hormones (Cai et al., 2012; Ronveaux et al., 2015), loss of appetite (Kimura et al., 2018), decreased nutrient absorption and altered protein and lipid synthesis (Doorduijn et al., 2019), altered physical activity and food preferences, disrupted sleep patterns (Lucey, 2020), loss of olfactory function and taste (Attems et al., 2015; Olofsson et al.",c16b0c46-c1e8-47c8-a89a-96bd101590bb
7,introduction3,", 2021) and social isolation (Poey et al., 2017). It is not clear how these factors might interact to cause unintentional weight loss, whether they are influenced by sex or genetic differences and whether preventing unintentional weight loss can prevent cognitive decline. For reasons not yet clear, apolipoprotein E‐e4 allele (ApoE ε4), the main genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), may contribute to weight loss, especially in women (Vanhanen et al., 2001; Ando et al., 2022). It is possible that ApoE ε4 contributes to accelerated hypothalamic degeneration which can have an adverse impact on leptin signalling, appetite, energy metabolism and food intake (Ando et al., 2022). The reason for sex differences in observed relations between ApoE ε4 is not known, but an interaction effect between sex hormone oestrogen and APOE‐ε4 on cognitive decline has been reported (Ando et al., 2022).",d22b1841-2755-4522-b118-c34de97b9ebd
8,introduction4,"  Undernutrition has been linked to accelerated brain atrophy in regions vulnerable to AD (Jimenez et al., 2017) suggesting a pathophysiological relationship between weight loss and cognitive decline (Lee et al., 2020), but only a few neuroimaging studies are available and findings are limited by variation in adjustment for confounders, such as diet, genetic risk, physical activity and medication use. As cognitive impairment progresses, deterioration in cognitive abilities can also affect the ability to shop, cook, prepare and eat meals and engage in physical activity, which can have a deleterious effect on nutritional status (Prince et al., 2014). There is a need to understand the links between undernutrition and cognitive decline, from the earliest to the advanced stages of cognitive impairment to uncover potential mechanisms and inform preventive strategies.",e8501fb2-4bec-4fa8-ad3f-ccc9b9a4c811
9,introduction5,"  Treatment of undernutrition by protein and energy supplementation has shown some benefit on bodyweight but no convincing effect on cognitive decline, which could be explained by the small number of studies conducted and the weak methodological quality of available data (Allen et al., 2013; Volkert et al., 2015; Correa‐Pérez et al., 2019). Since prior nutrition studies have focused on undernourished dementia patients (Lauque et al., 2004; Pivi et al., 2011; Vicente De Sousa et al., 2017), it is uncertain whether addressing undernutrition can protect against the onset of cognitive impairment. Preliminary data among undernourished, cognitively healthy adults, showed improved cognitive function in response to a 6 months personalised dietetic intervention (Endevelt et al., 2011) and following 6 months consumption of a nutrient‐rich drink (Wouters‐Wesseling et al., 2005).",041df5a9-609b-496c-9d25-b9a1fe2d79b6
10,introduction6," While data lend some support to the hypothesis that improved diet and nutritional status counteracts cognitive decline in older, undernourished adults, more nutrition trials are required to confirm these findings.

WP1: PROJECT AND CONSORTIA MANAGEMENT  The project is coordinated by Queen's University Belfast, working in close collaboration with the other scientific partners to ensure the project runs smoothly. The collaboration agreement and data management plan have been implemented so that scientific excellence and knowledge sharing are maintained throughout the project and all outputs and deliverables are met.

A further important part of WP1 is to build research capacity for nutrition and cognitive ageing research by training and mentoring early‐stage researchers (aiming for at least two PhD students and two postdoctoral researchers) in the field of nutrition and cognitive health.",558298c9-86e4-4f6e-bb86-8e0790db0333
17,introduction13,"  WP2: UNDERNUTRITION, COGNITIVE DECLINE AND DEMENTIA RISK  There is limited evidence as to whether undernutrition affects the rate of cognitive decline and the onset of dementia, or whether differences exist between men and women. protein enriched Mediterranean diet (PROMED)‐COG will exploit data from existing cohort studies to provide improved estimates of exposure to undernutrition on cognitive decline and dementia and identify determinants of weight loss and undernutrition in the population. Moreover, possible modifying factors on the association between undernutrition and cognitive deterioration will also be evaluated.  WP2 is led by partners from the University of Padova, Italy, and will pool data from three epidemiological Italian cohorts that are considered compatible on the criterion of adequate quality exposure and outcomes (Lauque et al., 2004; Pivi et al., 2011; Salva et al., 2011).",e59b8124-9575-41a6-8b41-f0e88e274177

WP3: MEDITERRANEAN DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND NEUROCOGNITIVE AGEING  The Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) and physical activity (PA) have been independently associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease (Livingston et al., 2017; Scarmeas et al., 2006; Anastasiou et al., 2018; Limongi et al., 2020), and their combination may have the strongest effect on reducing disease risk (Richard et al., 2013).",99339b28-1c21-4d7e-970a-2ad6026f47e1
21,introduction17," However, data are limited by the few studies available and further research is needed to assess the potentially additive effects for diet and PA on neurodegeneration and end‐stage dementia. Neuroimaging biomarkers, such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), provide sensitive measures of brain health and may help to elucidate potential mechanisms of modifiable behaviours on cognitive decline. To date, the combined effect of MedDiet and PA on brain structure is unknown. In addition, the biological mechanisms underlying associations between diet and neurocognition have been largely unexplored.  WP3 is led by National Research Council (Council (CNR)), Italy, and will address these scientific gaps. WP3 will firstly estimate the longitudinal associations between combined MedDiet and PA (MedEx), cognitive decline and risk of dementia using the pooled dataset from Italian Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ILSA), PRO.V.",e5319901-c755-475f-9eae-03f27d38b183

Secondly, WP3 will estimate independent cross‐sectional associations between MedEx and neuroimaging measures (including measures of total, grey matter, white matter volume and white matter lesions) and determine what factors may influence associations, for example socio‐demographic, body composition, inflammatory markers, cardiometabolic risk factors and depression. Data will be drawn from subsamples of two Italian cohorts, PRO.VA (n = 808) (Corti et al., 2002) and the cross‐sectional NutBrain study (www.nutbrain.it/study‐project) (n = 150) (Prinelli et al., 2020), that have complete data on ApoE ε4 genotyping and structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) (pooled cohort n = 958; age range 65–95 years; 58% female).",524275c8-4184-4905-9eb5-f9977194e69b
23,introduction19," WP3 will also explore the mechanistic pathways involved in diet‐associated neurocognition, hypothesising that a MedDiet enhances cognitive function and protects against dementia via favourable effects on brain structures, inflammatory markers and body composition, mediated by favourable metabolomic profiles (see WP4), and better nutrient intake. Inflammatory markers (C‐reactive protein and interleukin 6 [IL‐6]) and metabolomic analysis will be performed on blood samples from the NutBrain cohort to determine how the MedDiet might influence circulating metabolites and how the metabolites could mediate the associations between diet and neurocognitive measures.",b03a0a3a-71fd-428d-b392-4333f90d23c0
24,introduction20,"  WP4: THE protein enriched Mediterranean diet (PROMED)‐EX TRIAL—EFFECT OF A PROTEIN ENRICHED MEDITERRANEAN DIET AND EXERCISE INTERVENTION ON NUTRITIONAL STATUS AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE  It is critical to understand the role of lifestyle interventions for preventing undernutrition and promoting healthy neurocognitive ageing, particularly when implemented at an early stage of disease and in ‘high risk’ populations. The MedDiet is highly palatable and nutrient dense and, in this regard, may be both neuroprotective and helpful in preventing undernutrition. The MedDiet has been associated with reduced risk of nutritional deficiencies (Castro‐Quezada et al., 2014), while the moderate fat content of the diet enhances the absorption of micronutrients, especially the fat‐soluble vitamins A, D, E and K (Tosti et al., 2018) that are important for cognitive health during ageing (Prinelli et al., 2019). Adequate protein intake is also a key nutritional factor for prevention of undernutrition.",3e84d2fa-adc5-43d3-8dab-fb3c68f182a8
25,introduction21," Older adults have an increased requirement for dietary protein (1.2–1.5 g/kg bodyweight/day) to prevent and ameliorate sarcopenia, defined as loss of muscle mass and function (Bauer et al., 2013). Furthermore, exercise can stimulate protein synthesis (Trommelen et al., 2019) and enhance muscle mass, strength and functional performance in older adults (McGlory et al., 2019) making it an attractive target for prevention of undernutrition.

Across studies, we will use metabolomic and biomarker assessments to uncover biological mechanisms underlying how diet can influence nutrition status and neurocognitive ageing, and how PA interacts with nutrition to influence these processes. In WP4, change in metabolomic profile, lipid profile, inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers and metabolic signals will be investigated using a blood sample collected at each study time point.

36,introduction32,"  For the first time, we will test a complex lifestyle intervention to determine whether adopting a protein‐enriched MedDiet can improve both nutritional status and cognition—an important health outcome for older adults—and whether there are further benefits offered by exercise. This methodological approach will complement the planned epidemiological analyses to generate robust evidence to inform public health recommendations and dietary guidelines.  There is integration of state‐of‐the‐art metabolomics, metabolic and nutritional biomarkers to elucidate biological mechanisms underlying how an adapted MedDiet can influence nutrition status and neurocognitive ageing, and how PA can interact with nutrition to modify these processes.  The linkage of nutrition and ageing researchers across Europe allows sharing of expertise and knowledge in multi‐domain lifestyle interventions biomarker development and assessment, epidemiology, ageing and cognitive function assessment.

37,conclusion0," The protein enriched Mediterranean diet (PROMED)‐COG project (2021–2023) aims to combine epidemiological and intervention research to provide new and critical insight into the role of undernutrition in neurocognitive ageing, how these effects can differ by sex, genetic risk and timing of undernutrition exposure, and how modifications of dietary and PA behaviour may act to reduce the burden of undernutrition and neurodegeneration. This is of public health importance given the increase in the ageing population across Europe and the link between undernutrition and dementia risk. The resulting scientific knowledge will be translated into public and practice recommendations to prevent undernutrition for healthy neurocognitive ageing in older European citizens.
