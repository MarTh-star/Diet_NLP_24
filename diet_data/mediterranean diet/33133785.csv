Eligibility and Selection Criteria  The general eligibility criteria consisted of quantitative studies that investigated as a primary or secondary outcome the associations between adherence to MD with the occurrence of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and/or AD. To be eligible for inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis, the study design had to be either an observational study (cross-sectional, case-control or longitudinal cohort studies) or a randomized controlled trial. Case-series and reviews were not considered.",dedad74e-25c0-4f8f-9e6f-db30b635095b

For quantitative analysis, articles where cognition was not measured objectively by neuropsychological tests, or the diagnosis was based on medical reports were excluded. We also excluded animal studies, letters to editor, editorials, book chapters, no original articles, reviews, trial protocols, and articles that either were not written in English or Spanish  2.2. Search Strategy  A systematic literature search using PubMed, Scopus and The Cochrane Library Plus was performed until June of 2021.",919e0cba-52ea-467b-8737-1f28af623eb5

The following data were recorded form each study: first author’s name, year of publication, study location, follow-up duration, sample size, age, diet and study-related measures and the measure and strength of the association HR or OR with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).  2.4. Risk of Bias Assessment  The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS)) for observational studies [23]. This scale examines potential bias on selection, comparability, and outcome. The total Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) score ranges from 0 to 10 for cross-sectional studies, and from 0 to 9 for case-control and cohort studies.",02bb2101-571f-42ec-9231-284e246fc958

Statistical Analysis  All types of associations were estimated as RRs and 95% CIs. HRs were directly considered as RRs and, where necessary, ORs were transformed into RRs with the use of the outcome incidence in the nonexposed group [24]. Because these transformations can underestimate the variance or the RRs derived from the ORs [25,26], we performed two sensitivity analyses, one that excluded three studies for which this transformation has been applied [8,16], and a second sensitivity analysis in which ORs were not transformed into RRs.

For this study, we converted the RR estimated using a 55-point scale to the corresponding RR in a 9-point scale. Results from multivariable models with the most-complete covariate adjustments were used. We computed a RR with 95% CI for an increase of one unit for each report. For those studies where adherence to MD were not introduced as continuous variable into the models, we used the method described by Greenland and Longnecker [28] and Orsini and colleagues [29] to calculate the trend from the correlated estimates for log RR across categories of MD adherence.

Pooled results were reported separately for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), AD, and the composite end point of any of these outcomes. To visually assess the RR estimates and corresponding 95% CIs across studies, we generated a forest plot shorted by year of publication. A subgroup analysis according to study design was also performed.  To assess heterogeneity of relative risks across studies, we examined forest plots and used Cochran’s Q tests (with a significance level of p ≤ 0.10) and I2 statistics. I2 > 30% was considered at least moderate heterogeneity. In the presence of heterogeneity, random effects models (DerSimonian and Laird method) were used rather than fixed effects models (Mantel-Haenszel method).

Also, two studies [7,36] that analyzed its main associations cross-sectional and longitudinally were reviewed.  Evidence shows that dietary scores are useful tools to evaluate the degree of adherence to MD [40,41]. In order to quantify adherence to MD, food frequency questionnaires (food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)) is currently the most frequent method used to assess food intake in large population-based studies and based on them, MedDiet scores (MDs) can be calculated, in which greater scores indicate higher MD adherence. In our revision to quantify the adherence to MD, most studies, administered a food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)) to evaluate participant’s dietary intake.  3.1.3.",b2f69ed8-d306-40a3-9b6d-eacbe0f2ef7a

Some of them also include behavioral assessment, through depression or anxiety scales. The specific neuropsychological tests used in each study are reflected in Table 1.  Among the studies included, seven of them [1,10,11,16,20,30,37] analyzed associations between MD adherence and neuropsychological tests (neuropsychological tests (NPT)). Significant results were found in four of them. One study [10] showed that higher MD adherence was related with better learning and memory performance in non-demented subjects. Other study showed that higher MD adherence was related with better memory [30].",6df6f9a0-7e72-498f-b63d-a7ddbdc6595a

Effects of Mediterranean Diet Adherence on Alzheimer’s Disease Risk, Incidence, or Progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment  Eight studies that analyzed risk of AD, its incidence or progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in relation to MD adherence were included. Five articles [8,17,27,36,38] provided significant associations, showing that higher MD adherence was related with lower risk of AD incidence in non-demented persons.

We did not find neither visually nor quantitative evidence of heterogeneity among these studies (I2 = 0%; p = 0.562).

21,methods21," Discussion  The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze through scientific evidence if adherence to MD is a beneficial factor to reduce the development of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD. To this end, 22 articles were qualitatively analyzed, and 11 were included in a meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that a higher adherence to MD significantly reduces the risk of developing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD.  Other previous systematic reviews and meta-analyzes have concluded that the highest Mediterranean diet score was inversely associated with cognitive decline [12,15,18]; Wu et al. in their meta-analysis, found a trend of a linear relationship of the Mediterranean diet score with the incident risk of cognitive disorders, but the association was not significant. In the analysis, additionally to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD, they also included other non AD type of dementia [18]; Furthermore Sigh et al.",140e4d61-f12a-488c-95b3-579fe3bd8bad
22,methods22," concluded that higher adherence to the MD was associated with a reduced risk of developing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD, and a reduced risk of progressing from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. However, the overall number of studies were small (a total of five studies in the quantitative analysis) [12]. Fuerthermore, a recent study by, Charisis et al, demonstrated that individuals with highest adherence to MD had a 72% lower risk for development of dementia [42].  Up to date, prospective-cohort studies with longer follow-up has been performed. In order to consolidate greater evidence and to focus exclusively in AD type dementia and the previous stage of the disease (Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)), in the present review we first performed a qualitative analysis with a detail and comprehensive update from a clinical point of view of the studies in this field.",7015f847-c2fb-4756-a952-8cba86dfa000
23,methods23," In a second step we have deepened by carrying out a quantitative analysis to analyze the effects of the MD and the risk of developing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or AD.  Among the 22 studies reviewed, a total of 19 articles showed significant associations supporting MD role in prevention of AD development. Concerning AD risk, incidence, or progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), seven studies provided significant evidence in relation to MD adherence as a protective factor [9,13,16,17,27,36,38]. Furthermore, three articles submitted evidence of association between MD adherence and better cognitive performance in neuropsychological tests (NPT) in CN participants [10,11,16] and one in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects [30]. In relation to AD preclinical biomarkers, it has been studied that AD preclinical biomarkers could appear 20–30 years upstream of clinical expression of AD [1].",b817d576-8396-422f-8d0d-174dbc691dfa
24,methods24," In addition, it is suggested that changes in cortical thickness appear after decline in glucose metabolism and βA deposition in brain [3]. Five studies showed significant MD protective effects in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) volumetry measures [3,10,20,30,35], three articles in glucose metabolism in brain [1,7,35], five studies in βA burden in brain [7,12,14,33,35], one study in Tau tangles deposition [33] and one related βA and Tau in cerebrospinal fluid [30].  These results, all of them obtained from studies whose participants were middle aged instead of elderly, suggest that pathophysiology of AD experiences an evolution from neurological metabolism dysfunction and pathological deposition of βA without cognitive impairment, to changes in brain structure, leading all these events to AD cognitive manifestations.  There are non-modifiable factors that have been demonstrated to increase risk of AD and that have been included in some articles as covariates.",35b3e95f-a691-4950-ad4d-7872cb3a7e5f
25,methods25," In relation to them, nineteen articles included an APO-E4 genotyping [1,3,7,8,9,13,14,16,20,27,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38], showing the study of Mosconi et al. that effects of greater cortical thickness in subjects with high adherence to MD were even greater in those that did not carry APO-E4 gene [20]. APO-E4 gene has been suggested to be a potential mediator of metabolic functions [31], so its presence could reduce protective effects of adherence to MD in people. With respect to age, most of the studies included elderly people, except five of them [1,3,7,20,35] which included CN middle aged participants. The last non-modifiable risk factor for AD that has been considered in articles is female gender, who is greater risk of developing AD and progressing from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. A possible reason for that fact is that penetrance of APO-E4 is higher in women than in men [1,32].",017b12f6-b0a4-469f-9fa0-9313ebf5e6de
26,methods26," Even though most of the studies included both female and male in their participants, two studies included only female [31,32] (although no significant associations were found) and one study included only male participants [34] (without significant relating MD to AD risk neither).  The results of our meta-analysis should be interpreted in context of the limitations of available data. Modifiable risk factors are especially important influencing MD adherence protective effects, acting synergistically and additively to modify AD risk. Among them, cardiovascular risk factors, exercise, inflammation markers, body mass index (BMI), years of education, smoking and comorbidities has been considered when analyzing main results in some studies. In addition, some of the studies, due to the difficulty to distinguish AD from vascular dementia, excluded from their participants those that suffered from cardiovascular diseases [1,3,7,11,20,24,34,35].",13b1b131-38a9-4936-817a-a0f1ccfa31df
27,methods27,"  Furthermore, MD is the healthy dietary pattern object of study in this review. In most of the studies, food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were administered to participants to obtain information about their dietary habits and, after answering them, MDs were constructed therefrom. This procedure, although is based on the use of validated questionnaires and scores, have certain limitations. On one hand, cut-offs used for the construction of MDs depend on the average consume of each food product in the population studied, and that average is different between populations. Those dietary habits differences between populations makes difficult to compare MD adherences obtained from studies conducted in different countries. Furthermore, food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) can underestimate consume of some food groups which might not be included or fully represented in their food lists.",b18e126d-8985-4e17-8002-42225df41290
28,methods28," Only one study that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were conducted in a Mediterranean country, (France), where MD adherence is supposed to be greater [37].  Another limitation of these procedures used for quantifying MD adherence is that they rely on self-reported data. When AD subjects were included, their caregivers were who reported their food consume, but, despite this, cares are often elderly relatives of the patient and could also have some cognitive decline. It is also needed to consider that cognitive impairment patients could obtain MDs that do not accurately quantify their adherence to MD in the past. With this purpose, some studies evaluated stability of dietary habits in their participants [7,17,20,27,32,35,36,37,38].  There are underlying biological mechanism that could explain MD role in AD prevention.",da3e9930-aeac-4f79-a176-25abed83d1b9
29,methods29," Even though they are still unknown, some studies propose four different pathways that could interplay in order to explain how MD is a protective factor for AD: MD could be neuroprotective through its metabolic effects, which is reflected in those studies that show significant associations between higher MD adherence and greater glucose metabolism in brain. Vascular pathways have also been studied as mediators of MD effects. MD has been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular risk factors, which are themselves risk factors for AD [6]. On the other hand, MD has been proved to reduce oxidative stress due to antioxidative properties of many of its food components [34]. Finally, anti-inflammatory properties of MD could have an important role in its neuroprotective effects.",e5953078-db18-407e-ad1f-06f808c65336
30,methods30,"  Furthermore, other lifestyle habits, such as exercise, that have been proposed to be independent protective factors for AD, could interact with MD habits enhancing each other its beneficial effects, as it has been found in one study [17].  In summary, the main limitations found in the present review, are the heterogeneity and variability of the articles included in it, such as differences in samples size or studies designs, being most of them cross-sectional ones, which limit to infer causality; the use of diverse food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) and procedures to estimate MD adherence; differences between outcomes measured and techniques used for these purposes; and differences between dietary habits in regions where studies were conducted. Furthermore, another potential limitation is that tools used for estimate MD adherence are based in self-reported data, which might lead to bias.",0e9a9564-8c95-4275-8fbf-2d03007f17c1
31,methods31,"  To overcome these limitations and strengthen the evidence available so far, more longitudinal studies, with longer follow-up periods from earlier ages of life in preclinical stages; studies performed in Mediterranean countries (where is known that MD adherence is higher) and more studies to determine the different pathological pathways underlying MD effects on brain, are needed.  This study has some strengths worth highlighting: the rigorous search and selection strategy, the use of three blinded reviewers for article selection and two blinded reviewers for data extraction, and the assessment of risk and publication bias.  5. Conclusions  This meta-analysis shows that higher adherence to MD reduce the risk to develop Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD.
