0,background0,"As the population ages the prevalence and impact of chronic age-related diseases and disorders is predicted to increase dramatically [1]. In the elderly, dementia and cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) are amongst the greatest contributors to death and disability worldwide, and their costs are expected to double and triple respectively over the next 20 years [2–4].  Mediterranean populations in southern Europe, such as Greece and Italy, exhibit significantly lower rates of mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia than populations in northern Europe and the United States [5]. It has been suggested that this disparity is due to diverse dietary patterns across populations, and that a Mediterranean diet may be protective against cardiovascular disease (CVD) [6, 7]. As cardiovascular health is a significant predictor of dementia [8, 9], the Mediterranean dietary pattern may also be responsible for lower rates of dementia.",60ac934e-9575-4238-b6a5-9113c712787f
1,background1,"  A traditional Mediterranean diet is characterised by a high intake of extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)), vegetables, fruits, cereals, nuts, pulses and legumes; a moderate intake of fish, poultry, dairy and red wine; and a low intake of eggs, red and processed meat, and sweet and processed foods [10]. The Mediterranean dietary pattern is therefore rich in bioactive nutrients and phytochemicals such as monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (including omega-3 s), polyphenols and flavonoids, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fibre. Individually, these dietary components are associated with improved cardiovascular health [11–14]. However, single nutrients are not consumed in isolation, but collectively as a dietary pattern. As such, synergistic relationships between nutrients may enhance these benefits [15–17].  When compared with other dietary patterns a Mediterranean diet has consistently improved indicators of cardiovascular health.",7b0885b5-f4ee-44e3-b926-a76d9d59987a
2,background2," For example, a Mediterranean diet has been shown to improve blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles and markers of inflammation [18–20], while reducing risk of cardiovascular events by 30% [21].  While Mediterranean populations who follow a Mediterranean diet exhibit lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia [15, 22–25], few studies have investigated whether the diet can be successfully adopted in populations beyond the Mediterranean Sea. Notably, the MedLey study examined the effects of a Mediterranean diet over 6 months and found that an older Australian population was capable of adopting the Mediterranean diet [26]. However, participants indicated that one of the most difficult aspects of following the diet was restricting red meat intake [27].  A traditional Mediterranean diet is typically low in red meat products and Mediterranean dietary guidelines recommend consuming less than two serves of red meat per week [28, 29].",a608d123-c696-4442-9fd7-4d7ea841039d
3,background3," A recent review has reported that a traditional Mediterranean diet includes 105 g, or 0.5 to 0.75 standard serves of meat and meat products per day [10]. This figure is inclusive of all processed and unprocessed red and white meat products. In contrast, Australians over the age of 19 consume an average of 184 g of meat per day, or 1.7 serves of lean meats and alternates, with red meat contributing the largest proportion of this (38%) [30]. Australians are amongst the highest consumers of meat in the world [31]. Therefore, it is not surprising that restricting red meat may prove difficult. Countries with comparatively high meat intakes, such as the United States and United Kingdom, may experience similar difficulties (OECD, 2016). As socio-cultural norms and palatability are key determinants of a dietary intervention’s sustainability [32], non-Mediterranean populations may then be more likely to adhere to a diet containing more red meat.",dc2cabd5-5075-4654-9384-c6c08d1bb5b2
4,background4,"  Prospective cohort studies have drawn attention to significant associations between red meat and poor health outcomes, including bowel cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [33]. Proposed mechanisms point to the pro-oxidative properties of heme iron found in red meat. However, recent investigations highlight the mediating effects of other dietary components on oxidation [34]. For example, consuming extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) with red meat has been shown to attenuate lipid oxidation and the production of free radicals [35]. When vitamin E, found in green leafy vegetables and nuts, is consumed in combination with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and red meat, lipid oxidation is further inhibited [35]. Moreover, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) study reported significant interactions between red meat and dietary fibre [36].",dca9d2a6-c5ad-4ba1-8214-a12d092cd76b
5,background5," Specifically, individuals consuming red meat every day had a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer if they also consumed at least 26 g of dietary fibre each day – that is, less dietary fibre than is provided by the Mediterranean diet [10]. The potentially harmful effects of red meat may then be mitigated when consumed within a Mediterranean dietary pattern.  Australia’s most frequently consumed red meat products are beef and pork [31]. In terms of nutritional value, fresh lean beef and pork have similar nutrient profiles. However, fresh lean pork contains considerably less heme iron than beef [37] and less saturated fat per 100 g. Pork may then be an appropriate addition to a Mediterranean diet, which is typically low in saturated fat and heme iron sources [10].",efa2a373-8817-4460-9933-e58329941ed7
6,background6," Our previous research indicates that substituting beef and chicken with pork may be effective for improving cardiometabolic health markers, including weight, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), percentage body fat, fat mass and abdominal fat, without negatively affecting blood lipids, insulin or glucose [38]. Further, when compared with ruminant meats such as beef and some methods of aquaculture, pork production is associated with significantly less agricultural greenhouse gas emissions [39].  At present, there are no studies to our knowledge that have investigated the substitution of meat protein sources in the Mediterranean diet to increase variety and sustainability for the target population and environment. The current study therefore aims to evaluate the cardiovascular and cognitive benefits of a Mediterranean diet, supplemented with fresh, lean pork against a low-fat diet.",44e3e941-ea3f-439e-a3ab-ed152a9ad5d5
7,background7," A low-fat control diet has been chosen due to its continued recommendation for the clinical management and reduction of cardiovascular risk [40]. Further, including a low-fat control will enable comparisons of our findings against larger studies of the same design, such as the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED)) trial. Due to the pressing need to reduce the impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia, the modified Mediterranean diet will be evaluated for its potential to improve cardiovascular health and cognitive risk in an at-risk population.

During the washout period participants will return to their habitual diet to prevent cross-contamination of effects between dietary phases.Fig. 1 Title: 24-week cross-over design trial     By reducing potential between-subject differences a cross-over design reduces the effects of potential confounding variables, and therefore enhances internal validity of the design. Further, performing repeated measures on the same individual allows for an estimation of an individual’s true value, measurement error and treatment effect, meaning that fewer participants will be required to detect a treatment effect. An 8-week intervention period has been chosen as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of similar length have found that nutrients contained within the Mediterranean diet can improve both cardiovascular and cognitive function [41–43].",b95becae-fd51-40fc-a447-eabcc5ee3157
15,methods7," Eight weeks is expected to be an adequate washout period [44]. However, potential carryover effects will be assessed by testing for intervention*phase interactions.  Dietary interventions Neither diet will restrict energy intake. Instead, participants will be advised to self-regulate their food intake and consume foods ad-libitum.  Low-fat diet Guidelines for the low-fat diet are based on the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) study, which compared two variations of a Mediterranean diet with a low-fat control diet [45]. Participants will be advised to make adjustments to their habitual diet in order to reduce total fat intake. Specifically, high fat foods, including all types of oil, butter, margarine, processed and high fat meats, nuts, chocolates, cakes, pastry, and high or full fat dairy, will be replaced with low-fat alternatives, such as breads and cereals, legumes, rice, fruits and vegetables and low-fat varieties (e.g. low-fat dairy, low-fat sauces).",c717d907-2816-4326-85f6-fce32714c6c1

20,methods12," These visits will also include weight measurement to determine body mass, weight loss or weight gain. In the case of weight loss or gain the dietitian will ensure that participants are eating until satiated and discuss mindful eating and portion sizes. If a participant is having trouble adhering to the guidelines the dietitian will discuss strategies and work with the participant to set SMART goals (S, specific; M, measureable; A, achievable; R, realistic; T, time based) for the next 2 weeks.  Outcome measures Home blood pressure Home measured systolic blood pressure will be the primary outcome measure.

A score of 6 and above on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) has been linked to significant increases in reaction time and lapses on a psychomotor vigilance task, and decreased levels of arousal as measured by the alpha attenuation test [59].  To screen for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to detect change in cognitive function associated with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (attention, orientation, memory, fluency, language and visuospatial abilities), the ACE-R will be administered during screening visits and at the end of each dietary phase [60]. The ACE-R is frequently used in clinical and research settings, with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting both dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).",e76bf29c-ab05-447e-b707-32e8aeeca7ab
28,methods20,"  Future risk of dementia will be calculated using the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (Cardiovascular Risk Factors Aging and Dementia (CAIDE)) score, and the Framingham vascular risk score (Framingham vascular risk score (FRS)) [61]. The Cardiovascular Risk Factors Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) predicts 20-year dementia risk based on middle age profiles with high sensitivity (0.81) and moderate specificity (0.61). The Cardiovascular Risk Factors Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) score is based on age, sex, education, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, physical activity and APOEε4 genotype. Similarly, the Framingham vascular risk score (FRS) determines risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) on the basis of age, sex, systolic blood pressure, hypertension, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, smoking status and diabetes [62].",a06579cf-e303-45aa-a634-fdd659cdf0a6

Psychological well-being, an outcome and determinant of health behaviours, will be evaluated through the SF-36 Health Survey Version II adapted for use in Australia [63] and the Profile of Mood States (Profile of Mood States (POMS)). The SF-36 and Profile of Mood States (POMS) have been chosen for their relevance to a non-clinical population. The SF-36 was designed to measure subjective perceptions of health status across the domains of vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health [64].",f6f60258-bf50-4368-a458-da3753e6ed6f
30,methods22," The Australian SF-36 has demonstrated high internal consistency and reliability, adequate test-retest reliability and sensitivity to change, including sensitivity to nutritional interventions [65, 66]. The Profile of Mood States (POMS) measures mood states of tension, anxiety, anger, hostility, vigour, activity, fatigue, inertia, depression, dejection, confusion and bewilderment by asking participants to rate the extent to which they have recently felt different emotions [67]. For the purpose of the proposed study, participants will be asked about the extent to which they have felt emotions over the past month. The Profile of Mood States (POMS) has demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.63 to 0.96) and test re-test reliability of r = 0.61 to r = 0.69 at 6 weeks [68].",2700ae48-924c-4465-8fb6-893e6a9b5a7a
31,methods23,"  Dietary adherence A 15-item Mediterranean diet adherence survey and a 9-item low-fat diet adherence survey (Appendix 6) will be administered to participants bi-weekly to capture generalised patterns of food consumption during each of the intervention phases. Each survey has been adapted from the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) study to reflect an Australian food supply and national guidelines for alcohol consumption. While on the Mediterranean diet, participants will also complete a semi-quantitative weekly checklist (Appendix 3, described above). Adherence to the dietary phase will be determined at each bi-weekly visit, where participants must meet a minimum adherence requirement of 75%, as determined by checklists. If participants scoring below 75% are unable to increase their adherence in the next 2 weeks they will be excluded from the study.",1ff2286c-7cab-42a2-ad57-2e3eb25dc023
32,methods24,"  To determine the impact of dietary adherence on outcomes an overall Mediterranean diet score [15, 26] will be calculated using data from a 3-day weighed food record (weighed food record (WFR)) completed by participants before and at the end of each intervention phase. Further, erythrocyte fatty acids will provide a biological measure of dietary adherence at the end of each intervention phase.  Exit survey At the end of each intervention an exit survey will be administered to capture further insight and qualitative information about participant perceptions of the diets. The surveys will ask participants to elaborate what they enjoyed and found challenging about the diet they have just completed. To measure hunger and satiety experienced during each intervention the survey will also include five questions based on the 5-Factor Satiety Questionnaire [69] with corresponding visual analogue scales (visual analogue scales (VAS)).",f6dde3a0-2706-4822-a112-fc104c9ca7b7

Instructions and equipment will be given for the collection of home measures, including blood pressure, SF-36, Profile of Mood States (POMS) and weighed food record (WFR). Participants will then return 1 week later for week 0 assessments.  Clinic assessment visits will take place at baseline of the first diet (week 0), at the end of the first diet (week 8), at baseline of the second diet, after the 8-week washout period (week 16), and at the end of the second diet (week 24).",21772e94-f35e-4d0a-acb5-33ec5ad6b20f
35,methods27," Data for home measures will be collected by participants in the week prior to each of these visits.  At clinic assessment visits participants will be fasted from food, beverages (excluding water), alcohol and caffeine for 12 h. Clinic assessment visits will include measurement of blood pressure, body anthropometry, dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and collection of fasted blood samples. At weeks 0 and 16 participants will be allocated to their diet and meet with a dietitian to discuss the dietary guidelines. Participants will then be given a continental breakfast before cognitive tasks are administered. To minimise the impact and influence of external variables, cognitive testing conditions will be rigorously controlled and standardised as outlined by [70]. All cognitive testing sessions will take place between 9:30 am and 12:00 pm. To limit the impact of food intake on cognitive performance, participants will consume the same breakfast before each cognitive session.",15449247-73cd-4aae-ba46-49f8154cc5c7
36,methods28,"  If participants have performed a strenuous level of non-habitual exercise in past 10 h, not had an adequate amount of sleep, or are unusually tired cognitive assessments will be rescheduled. Temperature and noise of the cognitive testing environment will be controlled in order to reduce distraction and test administration will be standardised through the use of a testing script provided by Cambridge Cognition. Participants will commence the dietary intervention on the day following week 0 and week 16 visits, and will commence the washout period on the day of the week 8 visit.  Between weeks 0 and 8, and 16 and 24 participants will attend bi-weekly dietetic visits at the SIHR CTF. In the final dietetic visit of each diet phase, and at week 15, participants will be provided with equipment for the collection of home measures to be returned at their next clinic assessment visit.  Volunteers will be instructed to continue any habitual exercise and medications for the duration of the trial.",259970f8-da87-4a19-a396-c482b8d4e17c
37,methods29, Changes to exercise and medications will be monitored and recorded at bi-weekly dietetic visits and clinic assessment visits by the investigators. ,cf1b736d-cce4-4c22-a524-91e6db77a68b
38,analysis0,"Statistical analyses will be conducted using SPSS for Windows, version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and Stata (version 14.2, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Data will be presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) for descriptive statistics and as means ± standard error (standard error (SEM)) for reporting estimated effects. All tests will be 2-tailed with p-values <0.05 deemed statistically significant.  Based on power calculations, a sample size of 31 volunteers is required to detect a clinically relevant difference of 2.5 mmHg in home blood pressure, the primary outcome measure, with power of 90%. This calculation accounts for a total of 54 readings (three readings taken three times per day for 6 days) at each time point, a within-group standard deviation of 14 mmHg, a within-subject repeated measures correlation of r = 0.6 and a between-phase within-subject correlation of ρ = 0.5.",aa4114ab-426f-4bff-8220-e6d183507ca6
39,analysis1," The correlation (ρ) and use of a cross-over design reduces the number of required participants by a factor of (1 − ρ)/2 = 4 [153] i.e., from approximately n = 124 for a parallel group design using ANCOVA (n = 62 per group) to n = 31 subjects in total.  Baseline demographic, cardiometabolic, cognitive, well-being and dietary characteristic data will be compared for those who complete the study and those who withdraw using independent t-test and chi-square tests, depending on the type of variable and distribution of data.  The primary analysis will be performed on a per protocol basis including only those subjects who complete both trial phases. A linear mixed effects model will determine the difference in each outcome between dietary interventions and will measure both between and within subject effects for cardiometabolic and cognitive outcomes.",2654f303-d517-4f85-ab52-c1a0f34c2ec3
40,analysis2," If a significant change is detected for cognitive outcomes a hierarchical regression will include cardiometabolic outcomes to assess their meditating effects. A sensitivity analysis will include weight loss, change in physical activity, medications and supplements as these may cause time-varying confounding should they differ between groups in the second dietary phase. Further, carryover and treatment-period effects will be assessed by including treatment*phase and treatment*order interaction terms. A diet*period*energy intake interaction term will be included to determine any significant changes between diets in relation to total energy intake, macronutrient intake and micronutrient intake. As an additional sensitivity analysis we will also include subjects that did not complete the trial or were not included in the per protocol analysis due to inadequate adherence (<75%).",93d96ece-1f7f-486e-9fac-aaf50b58db94
41,analysis3, For missing data the linear mixed effects models will estimate unbiased effects as opposed to multiple imputation.  Trial and data management To ensure privacy and confidentiality each participant will be assigned a unique study identification (ID) number. All source documents will be de-identified (re-identifiable by coded ID numbers) and stored in an individual file for each study participant. All information collected as part of the study will remain confidential and no information that could lead to identification of any individual will be released. Access to trial data will be limited to the team of investigators named as authors on this publication.  Unintended effects and adverse events of the trial intervention will be identified during bi-weekly dietetic visits. All adverse and serious adverse events will be recorded and serious adverse events will be reported by the Chief Investigators to the University of South Australia Human Research Ethics Committee.,693c7bb1-048a-4150-8446-6db42d0d870b
42,analysis4," Participants will be advised to consult with their General Practitioner regarding any notable symptoms identified throughout the trial. If the instance of adverse events a decision to continue, modify or cease the intervention will be made on a case-by-case basis.  Due to the size of the trial and nature of the trial intervention a Data Monitoring Committee is not deemed necessary. The Chief Investigator will conduct quality control checks of data values twice during each dietary intervention phase to ensure data quality.  Electronic data entry will be completed throughout the trial by study personnel. Electronic data files will be stored on a secure password protected network and backed up regularly on an external hard drive. Once the trial is complete and results have been published electronic files will be stored on a DVD in the Sansom Clinical Trials facility secure data store in the Bonython Jubilee Building, City East Campus.",34ef7e9c-90c2-4f1c-91db-efad8619b1eb

44,discussion0,"To reduce the impact of both dementia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) health and lifestyle interventions with the potential to mitigate multiple risk factors have been recommended above reactive, costly treatments [71, 72]. Risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, insulin sensitivity are shared by both dementia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [73–76]. Interventions targeting each of these simultaneously may be effective in reducing the prevalence of both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia. However, it is necessary to ensure that such interventions are sustainable, both for the target population and the environment.  The Mediterranean diet has demonstrated efficacy for reducing risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cognitive decline. Yet an Australian population, who typically consumes a high quantity of meat, may find adhering to the meat restrictions of the diet difficult.",544d7b5f-4e1b-400e-b81c-9afb6205f4fc
45,discussion1," This paper outlines the protocol of a randomised controlled trial that endeavours to compare a Mediterranean diet with an additional source of meat protein, against a low-fat control diet. Findings of the forthcoming study will be relevant at a policy, clinical and individual level and will provide insight as to whether consuming pork as a part of a Mediterranean diet can improve health outcomes while simultaneously increasing variety and sustainability for the target population.
