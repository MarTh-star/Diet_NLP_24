0,introduction0," Hip fracture is the most devastating frailty fracture in the elderly population,1 associated with severe consequences for health and quality of life,2 high health care costs3 and increased mortality.4 A diet rich in vegetables such as the ‘Mediterranean diet’ is associated with lower risk of hip fracture in both men and women.5,6 The underlying mechanisms are largely unknown and have not been investigated using mediation analysis.  Adherence to a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),7–9 which itself is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture.10,11 This could be a potential mechanistic pathway for the effect of Mediterranean diet on hip fracture risk. Another variable to consider in this complex relationship is body mass index (body mass index (BMI)). The majority of evidence suggests that a Mediterranean diet lowers body mass index (BMI).",ed6535d3-5b2d-460a-8453-90fa73556100
1,introduction1,"12 At the same time, body mass index (BMI) is associated with greater risk of T2DM,13 whereas body mass index (BMI) is in general inversely associated with fracture risk14 although it might be possible that those in the highest body mass index (BMI) range also have an increased risk of fracture at certain sites.15 The assumed directions of the causal effects are illustrated in Figure 1. Throughout, we assume that the causal assumptions underlying this causal diagram hold.

2,introduction2,"16 Mediation analysis using standard regression methods may provide biased estimates in the presence of exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounders,17,18 both when omitted (residual confounding) and when included (blocking other mediating paths) in the regression model. Modern mediation analysis uses explicit counterfactual scenarios and allows for decomposition of effects when conventional approaches are biased.18  The main purpose of this study was to estimate the controlled direct effect of self-reported adherence to a Mediterranean diet (in 1997) on the risk of hip fracture (in 2009–14) which is not mediated through incident T2DM (in 1997–2009). In addition to regression models where we condition on T2DM as a mediator, we applied inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models (marginal structural models (MSM)) considering body mass index (BMI) as an exposure-induced confounder of the T2DM-hip fracture association,19,20 to estimate this effect.",b3ee304d-de53-42bf-bd53-46b5d47c64df

The register covers all inpatient care in Sweden since 1987 and is valid for hip fracture identification22–24 with minimal loss to follow-up. The cumulative incidence of hip fracture between 14 April 2009 and 31 December 2014 was used as outcome (shown by age and sex in Supplementary Figure S2, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).

One point was given for intakes above the median for: fruit and vegetables; legumes and nuts; non-refined or high-fibre grains; fermented dairy products; and fish. Further, one point was given for: intakes below the median of red and processed meat; use of olive or rapeseed oil for cooking or as dressing; and moderate alcohol consumption (5–15 g ethanol/day).

Due to the complex causal relations of diet, body mass index (BMI), T2DM and hip fracture, we further explored the different mediating paths, treating body mass index (BMI) and T2DM as causally ordered mediators. Using different methods for effect estimation, we observed a direct effect of adherence to Mediterranean diet on hip fracture, not mediated by T2DM or body mass index (BMI).

The marginal structural models (MSM) method is further advantageous to Models 2 and 3 in that it does not require the assumption of no unmeasured confounding19,20 between body mass index (BMI) and hip fracture.

Thus, if no change in estimate is seen after addition of a potential mediator to a logistic regression model, one may draw wrong conclusions regarding presence of mediation. Importantly, mediation effects will be underestimated when based on the difference-in-coefficients method using logistic regression,34 and we cannot exclude that they do not exist.  In contrast, the natural direct and indirect effects ORs can be compared with the total effect, since they are conditional on exposure levels and the same set of confounders; the product of the path-specific effects is approximately equal to the total effect.",1160fe07-8ab6-4420-885c-24d6e12fe887

It is possible that the mediating effects of T2DM and body mass index (BMI) on hip fracture cancel each other out, so that it seems that there is little or no average mediating effect of the two. Potential mechanisms include that a higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet leads to lower body mass index (BMI)12 and therefore lower bone mineral density35 (associated with increased hip fracture risk), whereas the lower body mass index (BMI) may also lead to a lower incidence of T2DM and thereby lower risk of hip fracture.36 The estimated natural indirect effect explicitly combines these pathways, and cancelling out of effects could explain the—potentially by chance—small negative effect.",cb88d7f8-b579-40c6-9431-e063619ee2d2
33,discussion5," The remaining partial indirect effect going through T2DM seems small. Thus, despite application of methods for the separation of mediating effects, our example illustrates that when complex causal relations exist, it may still not be possible to isolate the effect of main interest, in our case the natural indirect effect of mMED on hip fracture with T2DM as a mediator.  The interpretation of our results could be that the effect of mMED on hip fracture risk is primarily not mediated through T2DM, nor through body mass index (BMI) and T2DM, but rather through other pathways not examined in this study. Such pathways may include dietary constituents of the key food groups (plant foods, olive oil and fish) that have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects leading to bone and muscle sparing consequences and therefore fracture prevention.",1dc233ad-b822-4f71-b6a2-0b1179add1de
34,discussion6,"37–44  In the estimation of the conditional controlled direct effect (using Inverse probability weighting (IPW)-marginal structural models (MSM) conditional on confounders) we fix the mediator to a certain level, whereas in the estimation of natural direct and indirect effects we fix the mediator to the natural value it would have been, given a certain level of exposure. Both methods rely on pre-specified assumptions. Even if the counterfactual framework allows for analysis and interpretation of mediation effects, critique of the methods includes that the combination of counterfactuals assessed in mediation analysis are constructs that can never be observed. Because controlled direct effects generally are closer to interventional scenarios where intermediates can be intervened upon (although interventional interpretations cannot always be made), they may be of greater interest in policy evaluation and planning.",10f1da42-1075-475f-97ed-024cd2b571fa
35,discussion7,"45 Natural direct and indirect effects are of greater interest in evaluating the mechanisms of action between and exposure and an outcome via any potential mediators.46  To our knowledge there has been no research into the potential mediating effects of diet on hip fracture. Previous research examining the mediated effects of Mediterranean diet on childhood obesity47 and Alzheimer’s disease48 used standard regression models, which may lead to biased estimates.31 Other mediation approaches have primarily focused on considering multiple mediators jointly49 and not decomposing effects into different mediating pathways.",3bea3e13-e264-460b-81be-fd0bedffe77d
36,discussion8,"  Strengths of this study include the application of two recently developed mediation methods applied to a three-level categorical exposure, the large study population with a large number of hip fractures ascertained from official registers in a valid way with minimal loss to follow-up and the longitudinal design allowing temporal ordering of exposure, mediator and outcome variables, a prerequisite for mediation analysis. We were further able to take a large number of potential confounders into account, including comorbidity based on patient records. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of residual confounding, for instance by health seeking behaviour that is difficult to capture but can partly be accounted for by the adjustment for supplement use. The assumption of no residual confounding is further essential for causal inference.",176f97eb-0ce9-42c4-892d-0a5280d46b89
37,discussion9,"  Limitations include the self-reported nature of diet, height, weight, diabetes and covariates (Supplementary Discussion, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). Misreporting of or changes in dietary habits would lead to bias towards the null for the effect of Mediterranean diet on diabetes and hip fracture. However, adherence to dietary patterns has been shown to be fairly stable over a period of 8–10 years.50,51 Restricting the duration of T2DM to incident cases in 1997–2009 is an inherent limitation of the available data that may limit our power to detect possible mediating effects, since duration will likely influence fracture risk. This restriction may have introduced selection bias since we did not consider hip fractures and deaths occurring in 1997–2009.",d6a57030-fac2-44d0-a598-84f954238f9b
38,discussion10," With repeat exposure assessments and exact dates of diabetes onset, we would have been able to apply recently developed methods to handle longitudinal mediation and time-to-event outcomes52,53 to overcome such limitations.  Our application of recently developed statistical techniques for counterfactual mediation analysis provides evidence for an effect of Mediterranean diet on hip fracture risk which is not mediated through T2DM. Although mediating effects of Mediterranean diet on hip fracture via T2DM (and body mass index (BMI)) seem minor, this may in fact be due to cancelling out of effects, and mediating effects may therefore be present. Still, our results suggest that the reduced risk of hip fracture with high adherence to a Mediterranean diet is likely to be largely mediated via the diet’s effect on other biological processes, which require further research.  Data are not freely available but it is possible to contact each cohort to request access.",6cfaf353-6ecd-4989-849f-90db5dd50ac8
