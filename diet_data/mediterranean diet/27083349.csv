0,methods0,"Subjects Participants in the current cross-sectional study were candidates for isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass and were recruited for Tehran Heart Center-Coronary Outcome Measurement (THC-COM) study. The study was carried out between May–September 2006. Participants in this study were patients admitted to the cardiothoracic ward for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery at a large Heart Center in this time period (Tehran heart center, Iran). The sample size calculation has been explained before [22]; briefly, the sample size was calculated using the formula for comparing two proportions: n = [(Zα/2 + Zβ)2 × {(p1 (1-p1) + (p2 (1-p2))}]/ (p1 - p2)2 where p1 is the proportion of the women with low quality Mediterranean regimen (0.3), p2 is the proportion of the men with low quality Mediterranean regimen (0.25), α error = 0.05, and power = 80% (1-β). Accordingly, a 125-subject sample size was determined for the study (125 in each group).",653bac82-70cc-488a-aab8-4403165998bb
1,methods1," We also assumed 20% loss (125 + 25) and as men with coronary artery disease (CAD) are twice as women (150 + 300), the final sample size of 450 was considered for the study [22, 23]. Reasons for drop-out or exclusion were incomplete dietary questionnaires (n = 1), and incomplete demographic questionnaires (n = 5). The final analytic sample in this study consisted of 454 patients aged 35–80 years who completed both the questionnaire and the medical examination. More details of study procedure and biochemical assays have been provided elsewhere [22]. Written informed consent was obtained from each participating subject. The study was approved by Tehran Heart Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.  Dietary assessment methods A 138-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) was used to assess the habitual dietary intakes of patients.",809357cb-7747-4914-af8a-993b237a71b3
2,methods2," The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) consisted of a list of foods with standard serving sizes commonly consumed by Iranians. Participants were asked to report how often they consumed each of the food items listed as the number of times per day, per week, per month or per year during the previous year. The reported frequency for each food item was then converted to a daily intake. Portion sizes of consumed foods were converted to grams by using household measures [24]. The questionnaire was previously validated for healthy Iranian population [25].  We calculated the diet score on the basis of Mediterranean diet quality index (Med-DQI) (Table 1). The index assigns a score of 0, 1 or 2 according to the daily intake of each of the seven components and then final score was reported as a summation of all nutrient scores ranged between 0 and 14. A lower score on this index denotes a better nutrition quality and higher adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern [19].",580c2c95-1c9d-4d73-a45f-a54676dc967c
3,methods3,"  The dietary phytochemical index (dietary phytochemical index (DPI)) was defined as the percent of dietary calories derived from foods rich in phytochemicals. Calories derived from fruits, vegetables (except for potatoes), legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruit/vegetable juices, soy products, wine, beer, and cider are enumerated in this index. The higher score denotes the higher phytochemical content of diet [12]. ",b31f458a-fb79-4178-81e7-dd09a6db3068
4,analysis0,"Data analysis was performed by SPSS statistical software package version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was performed for normality of the distributions of variables. The comparison of discrete variables was performed by Chi- square test. Continuous variables between groups were compared by independents sample- t test or one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Analysis of covariance (analysis of variance (ANOVA) Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)) was used to compare continuous variables between three groups adjusting for the confounding effects of age, gender and body mass index. General linear model was also applied for evaluating the association between total Med-DQI score and biochemical parameters adjusting for the mediating effects of dietary phytochemical score. P values less than 0.05 considered as significance level. ",f6a0ad24-a391-431c-b2c2-9169ad2eb300
5,results0,"As mentioned previously, higher MED-DQI scores denote higher adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern and better nutrition quality. While higher dietary phytochemical index (DPI) score indicates higher intake of dietary phytochemicals. Patients general information according to different categorizes of Med-DQI and dietary phytochemical index (DPI) are presented in Table 2. Mean age and BMI were not significantly different between two categorizes of Med-DQI. However patients with lower Med-DQI score were more likely to be male and have higher educational attainment (P < 0.05). Additionally the prevalence of diabetes was lower in the higher scores of Med-DQI. Patients in higher tertiles of dietary phytochemical index had higher BMI and were most likely to be male (P < 0.05).",46a9cc3d-c882-4e8d-9f5b-d376c5cedfb7

In General linear model for evaluation of the association between total Med-DQI score and biochemical parameters adjusting for the mediating effects of dietary phytochemical index (DPI), total Med-DQI score was associated with serum C reactive protein (CRP) and creatinine concentrations and these associations remained significant even after adjusting for the mediating effects of dietary phytochemical index (DPI) (Table 4). Moreover, patients with lower dietary phytochemical intake had significantly higher Med-DQI scores (Fig. 1, P < 0.004).",2eba93ce-fd28-43bc-8cce-18673f8924d7

9,discussion0,"Adherence to Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of coronary artery events and reduces the risk myocardial infarction, coronary bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery disease rates [15]; on the other hand, patients candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), did not have an acceptable nutritional status before and after surgery and malnutrition is a common feature of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) [26, 27]. Therefore, having a good nutritional status before surgery can be a useful strategy for prevention of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-induced malnutrition. Therefore it is very important to develop healthy dietary regiments for improving the patients’ nutritional status and quality of life.  Numerous evidences suggested the protective role of Mediterranean dietary pattern against cardiovascular disease [28] and its associated risk factors including metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity [29, 30].",717197b0-4111-4554-ada7-fb31d44c9be6
10,discussion1," In fact, over the past decades, numerous dietary models have been proposed to protect against metabolic abnormalities and among them, only the Mediterranean diet demonstrated a beneficial effect [31].  In the current study we demonstrated that patients with lower Med-DQI scores had higher educational attainment compared with patients with higher scores. Moreover, patients with higher scores of “saturated fatty acids” and “cholesterol” had significantly lower serum albumin and creatinine concentrations and higher Hb A1C percent respectively.  In a sub-analysis of the EPIC study analyzed a cohort of 497,308 people showed that a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a significantly lower body mass index and waist circumference within 3 years [29]. Likewise, the beneficial role of Mediterranean dietary pattern in protecting against Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors has been supported by several studies.",0f28f7ce-d4cc-40ac-b5dc-e36fdbf1b20d
11,discussion2," A two point increase of Mediterranean dietary score was associated with 33% reduced risk of mortality from cardiovascular causes (RR = 0.67, 95%, CI: 0.47–0.94) [28]. The role of Mediterranean dietary style in primary prevention of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a sample of 7747 adults at high risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) but without a manifest disease has been established in a large interventional study before [6].  The Mediterranean dietary quality index (Med-DQI) is a useful tool for predicting dietary quality and has been validated previously using nutritional biomarkers [19]. This index was based on the recommendations made by the National Research Council and American Heart Association regarding the diet and health [32].",f894b0a8-d016-43a6-a069-93ffd464f504
12,discussion3," These recommendations are based on consumption of 30% or less of the daily total energy from fat, 10% or less of the total energy from saturated fat, 30 mg/d or less from cholesterol, 55% of energy from complex carbohydrates and 5 servings or more from fruits and vegetables.  In the current study, for the first time, we evaluated the Med-DQI in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and according to our findings, higher scores of “saturated fatty acid” was associated with lower serum albumin concentrations (P = 0.04). Albumin is a main fatty acid transporter in the extracellular fluids and dietary factors influence its plasma concentrations [33]. Several animal studies observed the albumin- lowering effects of high fat diets. Andrson et al. [34] found that feeding high fat diet in mice induces a slight decrease in serum albumin concentrations.",df9b139a-0fac-4bd3-acbd-d6f11d9bf3a4
13,discussion4," Since Albumin synthesis is sensitive to insulin, they speculated that reduced serum albumin concentrations and biosynthesis is a result of high fat diet- induced insulin resistance. In other study, female rats feeding high-fat diets had 25% lower serum albumin concentrations [35].  Interestingly, patients in the lower categorizes of “cholesterol” subgroup had significantly higher serum HbA1C concentrations. Hb A1C is a better predictor of circulating lipids and better diagnostic marker of developing cardiovascular and micro-vascular complications [36, 37]. Previous studies observed a positive association between dietary cholesterol intake and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus [38, 39]. Since cholesterol is only present in products of animal origin, one can speculate that these associations could represent an adverse effect of a food pattern characterized by a high consumption of meat and eggs, or even an unidentified component of animal products [40].",98c6aac1-b9a8-45b9-a3e9-bcbb85f7deac
14,discussion5," However dietary cholesterol could have direct effects in incidence of type 2 diabetes via stimulating inflammatory pathways [41]. In animal models, dietary cholesterol per se produces an increase in serum amiloid A, a potent inflammatory mediator [42]. These inflammatory mediators can lead to incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus [43]. Moreover, dietary cholesterol disrupts glucose metabolism and increases serum insulin concentrations [38].  Serum creatinine is a marker of muscle mass and also dietary protein intake [44]. High dietary protein can also significantly raise serum creatinine concentrations [45]. In our study, patients with higher fish intake had higher serum creatinine concentrations, although none of these differences were out of normal range and these variations occurred in the physiologically normal range of serum creatinine. Previous studies also confirm our findings. In the study by Rasmussen et al.",25d903e3-a2eb-4649-94bc-f973f1197351
15,discussion6," the higher dietary fish intake was associated with higher urinary creatinine excretion [46].  We also observed high serum Lp (a) concentrations in patient with low intakes of cereals. Accordingly, the beneficial effects of cereals on serum Lp (a) have been previously confirmed. In the study by Xiong et al. breakfast and bran cereals had potent positive effects on reduction of serum Lp (a) concentrations [47]. Lp (a) is essentially an LDL particle with an apoprotein (a) attached to it. Numerous evidences have revealed that high serum Lp (a) concentration is associated with a variety of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, including peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, premature coronary disease and vascular injury [48]. The impact of cereals in improving serum lipoproteins and lipids are attributed to their fiber content as previously confirmed [49].",c7462436-146d-49ef-b4bd-b6c18cad1747
16,discussion7,  Conclusions The present study reported that patients with higher scores of “saturated fatty acids” and “cholesterol” had significantly lower serum albumin and higher Hb A1C percent respectively. Higher intake of “fish” was also associated with higher serum creatinine concentration. Further studies with interventional approaches are needed to better clarify the causal inference of these associations.
