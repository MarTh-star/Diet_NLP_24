1,introduction0," Lifestyle, through epigenetic mechanisms, is strongly involved in the pathogenesis and progression of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs),1 and has a great impact on quality of life.2 In this order, physical inactivity and obesity are, respectively, the two lifestyle risk factors most associated with the development of NCDs.3 Physical inactivity is the fourth largest risk factor for mortality worldwide,3 and it is associated with the comorbidities of overweight and obesity. People with these two conditions account for 27% of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) cases worldwide and 30% of ischemic heart disease cases.4 Consequently, the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) has instituted the target of reducing the prevalence of physical inactivity by 15% worldwide by 2030.5  Every extra hour of daily sedentary behavior has a negative impact on health.",57d93600-250e-4fc5-a475-0fb4ecd76b74
2,introduction1,"6 Compared with subjects who sit for 6 hours a day, those who sit for 8 hours have a 14% higher cardiovascular risk and those who sit for 10 hours a day, 29%.7 There is strong evidence that individuals who maintain sedentary behavior over time have greater all-cause mortality, as well as several negative health-related outcomes. This is more pronounced among physically inactive people, given that physical activity attenuates mortality risk. Higher physical activity levels among highly sedentary individuals are thus required.8  The possible pathways to negative health-related outcomes facilitated by a sedentary lifestyle include promotion of increased oxidative stress. This is a strong precursor of endothelial dysfunction and gives rise to greater release of free fatty acids in the bloodstream, thus favoring development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).9 In addition, a sedentary lifestyle causes insulin resistance10 and promotes accumulation of visceral fat.",91d3afc7-d719-4e9e-9be2-ada2ddd554a7
3,introduction2,"11,12  Previous studies have reported that each additional hour of sedentary time is associated with greater gain in body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and waist circumference (WC).8 A sedentary lifestyle can lead to development of obesity, which is the second highest risk factor for lifestyle-related premature death, after physical inactivity.13 Moreover, overweight and obesity cause insulin resistance14,15,16 and promoting deposition of ectopic lipids or visceral fat in different organs.17 This interferes with the normal function of organs, which thus increases the risk of many NCDs, especially CVD and T2DM.18 Physical activity is essential for achieving energy balance and weight control, thereby enabling maintenance of healthier body composition (BC) with an acceptable ratio of fat and muscle.19 It also protects against numerous NCDs,20,21 because it has a systemic dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect.",da30f17a-c271-44c4-81ce-3939b5846496
4,introduction3,"6,22,23  Regarding nutritional habits, adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been shown to have significant inverse associations with all-cause mortality24 and with the prevalence of CVD and T2DM, which are related to the anti-inflammatory properties of this diet.25,26 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in a pneumonia epidemic in January 2020.27 On January 30, 2020, it was declared by World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global health emergency28 and, since then, the virus has spread throughout the world, causing more than a million deaths.  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected and overwhelmed healthcare systems in unprecedented ways. Consequently, pending mass and effective vaccination, social distancing is the main preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2. Social distancing implies massive reorganization of society and lifestyles.",859605f9-20cc-4bbf-813b-f63d913b5d81
5,introduction4,"29 During the period of confinement experienced between March and May 2020 in many countries, the number of people who practiced physical activity decreased by approximately 30%30 and the number of hours spent sitting increased by 28.6%.31 However, adherence to the Mediterranean diet was not significantly affected.32  NCDs generally develop in the elderly population, but lifestyle behaviors become established during young adulthood, when individuals do not perceive that an unhealthy lifestyle implies a higher health risk.  There is great variability in the dietary patterns of university students, in part because there are many different questionnaires assessing the adherence to the Mediterranean diet.33 Generally, university students have a low adherence to the Mediterranean diet.34,35 Regarding physical activity levels, university students normally are highly active, but also report high amounts of sedentary behavior.",7999fd77-b109-493f-851b-ee16f3744bcc
6,introduction5,"36,37 Students with higher levels of physical activity usually report greater levels of health-related quality of life (HrQoL), especially regarding the mental component summary (mental component summary (MCS)).38,39,40  Further research on young adulthood is needed in order to ascertain the impact of lifestyle on HrQoL in young populations.  OBJECTIVE  We aimed to analyze the lifestyle and BC of young university students during the pandemic, and their relationship with HrQoL. We hypothesized that physical activity levels, sedentary behavior, unhealthy BC and poor adherence to the Mediterranean diet would have moderate negative associations with HrQoL.

7,methods0,"  Design  An observational cross-sectional study was developed, following the STROBE (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology) guidelines, between October and November 2020 at Universidad Europea de Madrid, in Spain.  Settings and participants  A total sample of 56 healthy young students was recruited at Universidad Europea de Madrid: age 23.5 ± 3.4 years; height 175 ± 8.1 cm; and body mass 68.3 ± 10.2 kg. The participants were recruited via e-mail between October and November 2020. The potential participants were reassured that nonparticipation would not have any consequences. A code was assigned to participants, prior to statistical analysis, thus guaranteeing the confidentiality of their data.  The inclusion criteria were that the participant needed to be a student at the Universidad Europea de Madrid34 and be between 18 and 34 years of age.",2a891f23-22a6-4b6a-8684-6bc27730b242

All the participants read and signed an informed consent statement before becoming part of this investigation.  Measurements  Physical activity level and sitting time were measured using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland) (Geneva Switzerland) (GPAQ)), a validated tool that was developed by World Health Organization (WHO) for estimating physical activity levels (MET-minutes/week) in diverse countries around the world.",37f1c1c3-8a4f-46d1-9a04-b135a5e2116d
9,methods2," This questionnaire makes it possible to see whether the subjects are complying with the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) physical exercise recommendations, and whether they are spending large amounts of time seated. The amount of sitting time associated with greater all-cause mortality among adults varies from 6 to 8 hours per day, so we established > 420 minutes/day as the health risk threshold for this study.4,8,43,44,45  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was measured using the PREDIMED questionnaire (Schroder et al., Barcelona, Spain).43 High adherence is considered to be shown by scores > 10 points; medium adherence, 8–9 points; and low adherence < 7 points. Having high adherence to the Mediterranean diet brings strong protection against CVD.44  HrQoL was measured using the short-form-36 (SF-36) health survey, version 2 (Alonso et al.",7fa2d7ff-46bf-48fe-a873-05ca04497b92

The eight sections are regrouped into two main components: physical component summary (physical component summary (PCS)) and mental component summary.41 The mean values for physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) are: 55.02 and 51.47 for men aged 18–24 years; 54.96 and 51.53 for men aged 25–34 years; 54.58 and 48.92 for women aged 18–24 years; and 53.87 and 49.62 for women aged 25–34 years.41  Body composition: height, weight and WC were measured using a stadiometer (in cm; Ano Sayol SL height rod, Barcelona, Spain), a scale (in kg; Asimed T2 scale, Barcelona, Spain) and a tape (in cm), respectively. body mass index (BMI) and the waist-to-height ratio (WtHr) were then calculated.",4916bcc1-5623-4c58-95af-470e666eba32
11,methods4," The values associated with an exponential risk of developing CVD and T2DM are WC > 102 cm in men and > 88 cm in women,46 and WtHr > 0.5 in men and women.47 WC and WtHr are highly correlated with visceral adipose tissue, which is the most clinically relevant adiposity variable, because of its association with the increased risk of NCDs. In contrast, body mass index (BMI) has a poor correlation with visceral adipose tissue.47,48 However, individuals with high body mass index (BMI) are at greater risk of developing high visceral adipose tissue levels, compared with individuals with healthy body mass index (BMI).49 ",129b9065-db3f-4f64-b397-4817e609b3ac
12,analysis0," Frequencies (sample size and proportion of samples) were assessed for categorical variables (adherence to Mediterranean diet and sitting time). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the normality of distribution.50 A descriptive analysis was developed for all the subjects using the mean ± standard deviation (SD) to describe the parametric data and the median ± interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)) for nonparametric data. The coefficient of variation (CV%) was calculated for all continuous variables. In addition, an independent-sample t test (in situations of normal distribution) or the Mann-Whitney U test (in situations of non-normal distribution) was applied to determine differences between high/low adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the remainder of the continuous variables (HrQoL, physical activity and BC).  The Spearman correlation test with 95% coefficient intervals was carried out to analyze the relationships between continuous variables.",8549e608-f2f1-4a12-8017-964fd5c7f1d2

16,discussion0,"  The subjects analyzed in this study had healthy BC values, as only 5% and 10.7% of the subjects had health-risk values for WC and WtHr, respectively. Regarding lifestyle, 44.6% of the subjects spent more than seven hours a day sitting down, which is a predisposing factor for development of cardiometabolic diseases over the long term.24,52 Individuals who maintain sedentary behavior over time have the highest all-cause mortality.8 Levels of physical activity were high (1880.37 ± 738.90 MET-min/week), such that 92.86% of the subjects were complying with the World Health Organization (WHO) 2020 physical activity recommendations.53 This was similar to the results reported in other studies with a student population.36,37  Physical activity attenuates mortality risk, and higher physical activity levels are required among highly sedentary individuals.8 Each additional hour of sedentary time is associated with greater gain in body mass index (BMI) and WC.",377bc629-193c-43f4-908f-e5198da3d872
17,discussion1,"8 However, in this study, we found only trivial-small correlations for physical activity and sitting time in relation to BC. The mean daily sitting time was 8.26 hours, while 19.64% of the subjects spent > 10 hours per day sitting.8 This is of great importance because if these habits are maintained over time, the risk of developing NCDs increases,3 given that sedentary behavior is associated with loss of metabolic flexibility,3 higher oxidative stress, insulin resistance, inflammation and DNA damage.54,55 Self-reported estimates from other studies have indicated that university students spend an average of 7.29 hours per day sitting, which is similar to our results. In contrast, data from accelerometer-based studies have suggested that university students engage in 9.82 hours of sedentary behavior per day. Chastin et al.",c72c53fc-3287-4d75-9fac-02383c96da29
18,discussion2," suggested that self-reports underestimate sedentary behavior, compared with accelerometer-based methods,37 so the subjects of our study may have been spending more time sitting that we thought.  Concerning nutritional habits, half of the subjects analyzed (51.8%) had low adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The mean PREDIMED score was 7.41, which denotes acceptable adherence to the Mediterranean diet, in line with data from the Spanish population that was previously reported.26 However, other studies on student populations reported lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet.34,35 Considering these data, it is necessary to seek strategies to reduce sitting time in the young population, in addition to promoting the Mediterranean diet, since the lifestyle habits developed in youth can affect health in old age.

However, several authors have argued that the negative impact on QoL among sedentary individuals and university students was related to foot health disorders.56,57 The low levels of HrQoL reported in the present study are probably related to the massive reorganization of our society and our lifestyle due to the COVID-19 pandemic.29  Regarding the relationship between BC and lifestyle variables and HrQoL, WC showed moderate correlations with VT, RE and mental component summary (MCS).

20,discussion4," In turn, sitting time was negatively correlated with PF, which highlights the negative impact of sedentary behavior on health.7 However, taking > 7 hours of sitting time per day as a reference value for health risk, no significant correlations were found between sitting time and the other variables. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet did not show any significant correlation with HrQoL or BC, which is relevant because this young population may not see any motivation to engage in changes in this regard. Moreover, large correlations exist between WC and body mass index (BMI), and very large correlations exist between WC and WtHr. It is known that WC is more associated with cardiometabolic diseases risk factors, as well as WtHr,58 compared with body mass index (BMI). In fact, in other populations, WC is a better indicator of poor physical HrQoL than body mass index (BMI).59  The aim of this study was to characterize the lifestyle of young students in a pandemic period.",f8048857-1033-46c0-a0c5-45a2e5146285

However, half of them had a poor dietary pattern and spent too many hours sitting. According to several studies, during the current COVID-19 pandemic period, physical activity levels have decreased by 30%30 and daily sitting time has increased (28.6%),31 while adherence to the Mediterranean diet has not been affected.32 This indicates that there needs to be a focus on improving these two aspects of the lifestyle of the young population. We also wanted to analyze HrQoL and its correlations with lifestyle. Sitting time was the variable that most negatively affected HrQoL, and it was striking that 39.2% and 46.4% of the subjects were in the lowest quintiles of physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS), respectively, according to the reference values for their age range.",22097982-743f-46e1-8f47-d1213b60941d

Study limitations and future lines  Our sample was obtained from just one particular university in one particular city. It would be very useful to obtain information from more universities in different locations. In addition, studying the implementation of a strengthening program or physical activity in relation to the Mediterranean diet, both among healthy individuals and among individuals presenting any pathological condition (e.g. COVID-19, musculoskeletal disorders or metabolic diseases) would be very interesting.
