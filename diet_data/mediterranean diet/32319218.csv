Study Design, Setting, and Participants  We used data from the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS)—conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)) in 2011–2012. The survey used a cross-sectional multistage area with an initial sample of 14,400 private dwellings that yielded a final sample of 9435 adults. The methodology has been published in detail elsewhere [20]. For this study, we selected participants who were adults (aged 18 years or over) and not pregnant or breast feeding at the time of the survey (n = 7744).  2.2.",f79af00d-13b8-4407-978c-609875858563
1,methods1," Ethics  The Australian Health Survey was conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) under the Census and Statistics Act 1905 which authorized the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to undertake the household interview component of the survey without requiring ethical approval. In October 2011, the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing’s Departmental Ethics Committee granted ethical approval for the biomedical data collections. Furthermore, written informed consent was obtained from participants for the in-home component and pathology collection center component separately [21]. The de-identified dataset is made available to researchers subject to the requirements of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) [22].  2.3. Data Sources/Measurement  The NNPAS which is part of the Australian Health Survey (Australian Health Survey (AHS)) was conducted from May 2011 to June 2012 in 9500 fully responding private dwellings [20].",cb0dad13-8a9b-411e-9bbd-f1805541c489
2,methods2," Trained Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) interviewers employed a Computer Assisted Personal Interview (Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI)) to collect data from the selected adult member of the household. Twenty-four-hour diet recalls were collected using the five-pass ‘Automated Multiple-Pass Method’ (an automated questionnaire that guides the interviewer through a system designed to maximize respondents’ opportunities for remembering and reporting foods eaten in the previous 24 h). It was developed by the United States Department of Agriculture and it was modified with assistance from Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ)) to reflect the Australian food supply. Food intake was then coded and classified using “AUSNUT 2011–2013” constructed by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ). For this study, we used dietary data from day one of the 24-h recalls.",ca07521b-a72e-4557-9ac6-88659fedd6e2
3,methods3,  Physical measurements were collected towards the end of the NNPAS survey and voluntarily; participants were encouraged to remove shoes and heavy clothing before their measurements were taken. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) interviewers used digital scales to measure weight (maximum 150 kg) and recorded it to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height (maximum 210 cm) was measured using a stadiometer and was recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. Height measurements were repeated on random 10% sample of respondents to validate the measurements.  2.4. Variables  All survey questions are listed in the Australian Health Survey (AHS) User Guide [23].  2.5. Outcome  Obesity and non-obesity were defined by body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 and body mass index (BMI) 18.5–29.9 kg/m2 respectively according to the World Health Organization criteria using measured weight and height.  2.6.,6ebdb4a8-7c53-49d1-8697-036921e8fe90
4,methods4," Predictors  Study predictors include Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA)) and the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). The Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) is a measure of socio-economic advantage and disadvantage, created using variables such as income, education, or housing according to residential postcode. The Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) was categorized into quintiles. Lower quintiles are indicative of individuals living in areas with higher levels of disadvantage. For the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), we followed the method proposed by Tricopoulou et al. [24], since it was one of the most common one reported in the published literature to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet [12]. A value of 0 or 1 was given to nine components according to sex-specific medians.",28635099-9867-4bc8-928e-fcb43f03db50
5,methods5," For potentially healthy components (vegetables, fruits and nuts, and cereal), study participants whose consumption was below the median were assigned a value of 0, and study participants whose consumption was equal to or above the median were assigned a value of 1. For legumes and fish, a value of 1 was given for any intake above zero.  For potentially unhealthy components (meat and dairy products), study participants whose consumption was below the median were assigned a value of 1, and study participants whose consumption was at or above the median were assigned a value of 0. For ethanol, a value of 1 was assigned to men who consumed between 10 and 50 g per day and to women who consumed between 5 and 25 g per day. Lastly, for fat intake, we used the ratio of monounsaturated lipids to saturated lipids and study participants whose consumption was below the median were assigned a value of 0, and study participants whose consumption was at or above the median were assigned a value of 1.",846a6239-c554-4ec1-acf0-f754df9d58cb
6,methods6," The scores for each of the 9 components were summed to give the total Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) which ranged from 0 (minimal adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet) to 9 (maximal adherence). The NNPAS categorized consumption as discretionary and non-discretionary [20]; in this study, we used food groups from non-discretionary sources to construct the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS).  2.7. Covariates  Our analyses were adjusted for sex (male/female), country of birth (Australia/other English-speaking countries/other), marital status (married or de facto/not married), hours usually worked each week (not in workforce or unemployed/1–24 h/25–39 h/40 h and more), and whether exercise last week met 150 min recommended guidelines (National Physical Activity Guidelines for Australian adults) [20] (met recommended guidelines/did not meet or do not know); smoking status (current smoker/ex-smoker/never smoked), energy density (first tertile/second tertile/third tertile),",d1f75fad-1873-4da1-a57d-68875a8e318f
7,methods7, and self-reported long-term health conditions (no condition/one condition only/multiple conditions) were included. We calculated energy density by dividing the total energy from food by total gram of food (kJ/g).  2.8. Bias  The response rate in the NNPAS was 77%. The dietary data in the NNPAS is from a 24-h recall method which can introduce recall bias when study participants forget the food and beverages they have consumed or misreport foods to comply with societal expectations.  2.9. Statistical Methods  We present the characteristics of the study participants by obesity and the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (Table S1). We tested the difference between the characteristics and the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) or obesity group using Pearson’s Chi-square tests and their p-values. A p-value of <0.05 was considered as a statistically significant difference along with clinical importance. Because the prevalence of obesity in the sample was greater than 10% (i.e.,30cc925a-f1ec-4789-9ef5-a3d35eeade7b
8,methods8,", 28%), we used log–binary regression models [25] to assess the independent associations with obesity; reported as prevalence ratios with associated 95% confidence intervals.  We hypothesized Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) would be associated with obesity both directly and indirectly via Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) as a mediator (Figure 1). Therefore, we conducted a mediation analysis to test this hypothesis in a subsample comparing lowest vs. highest Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA). We performed the analysis by fitting a log–binomial model for the outcome (obesity, yes = 1 and no = 0) and the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)-mediator (0–4 = 1 and 5–9 = 0). We obtained prevalence ratios of direct effect, indirect (mediated) effect, and total effect. We calculated percentages by multiplying the estimate with 100%. We conducted the statistical analyses using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) and the ‘mediation’ package [26] in R 4.0.",85ae5a03-941d-4120-9a82-5e03f97fc08d

From these adults, 1549 (70.9%) had lower Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (0–4), 481 (22.0%) lived in most disadvantaged areas (Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA)-lowest 20%), 1217 (55.7%) were married, and 834 (38.2%) were not in workforce or unemployed (Table 1).  A total of 5084 (65.7%) participants had lower Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (0–4); of these, 1018 (20.0%) participants lived in most disadvantaged areas and 1822 (35.8%) were not in workforce or unemployed (Table S1).  In terms of the association between Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) and obesity, the prevalence of obesity increased with socio-economic disadvantage categories in a linear way, independent of covariates (Models 1–6) (Table 2). The strength of this relationship slightly weakened, but remained robust even after adjustment for all covariates (Model 6).",d900ecc8-4dad-4a13-9293-7aa7e99e22de
10,methods10," Furthermore, Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) was associated with the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (Table S2).  To do the mediation analysis (Table 3), we first assessed the association between Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) and obesity (direct effect); lowest Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) (most disadvantaged) was associated with obesity. Second, we examined path A and path B; the lowest Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) (most disadvantaged) was associated with lower Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (0–4) (Path A) and lower Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (0–4) was associated with higher prevalence of obesity (Path B), respectively. The results showed a significant effect (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.08, 1.19) of lowest Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) associated with lower Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (0–4) (Path A), and a significant effect (PR 1.19, 95% CI 1.10, 1.29) of lower Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (0–4) associated with obesity (Path B).",a3ba00ee-e172-4999-b024-361600711535
11,methods11," Finally, Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) had an indirect effect (PR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00, 1.01) on obesity and 4.0% of the total effect of lowest Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) (most disadvantaged) on obesity is due to Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA)’s impact on the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS).  4. Discussion  4.1. Main Finding  To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the mediating role of unhealthy diet pattern, defined using low Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), in the association between socio-economic disadvantage and obesity. First, we found that socio-economic disadvantage was independently associated with increased prevalence ratios for obesity that ranged from 18% to 40% percentage points with each decreasing Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) quintile group in a dose–response way (Model 6. Table 2). This is consistent with several studies from high income countries like the USA, the UK, and Canada [27,28,29].",cc55c713-f0e3-4725-a640-654168facbf1
12,methods12," Second, we found that socio-economic disadvantage was independently associated with low Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (Model 5, in Table S2). Third, our mediation model showed that at least 4% of the association between the lowest Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) (highest disadvantage) and obesity prevalence was mediated by low Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (i.e., fewer elements of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)). These findings suggest that a significant proportion of the prevalence of obesity in the community could have been theoretically prevented with effective public health policy and/or community-based interventions targeting unhealthy dietary patterns. For instance, interventions focusing on a ‘healthy dietary pattern’ like the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) could have theoretically prevented more than 200,000 cases of obesity, which would have yielded substantial health and economic benefits for Australians [30,31].",64dd51cc-9ef1-4633-b8b7-12ef9d77c86d
13,methods13,"  Our finding demonstrating a mediation role of unhealthy diet confirms, for the first time, a plausible mechanism explaining the increased risk of obesity associated with socio-economic disadvantage. There is good evidence showing that exposure to socio-economic disadvantage is associated with an increased consumption of nutrient-poor and energy-dense foods (Path A); i.e., consuming more processed meat, refined grain, and sweets, but less fruit and vegetables, whole grains, or fish [15,32,33]. This phenomenon is likely explained by the high cost and low availability barriers to accessing healthy foods in societies around the world [34,35]. This theory is supported by findings from a cohort study which found that the higher daily cost of following a Mediterranean dietary pattern compared with a western dietary pattern was a predictor of weight gain among Spanish university graduates [36].",a2d94e39-52e0-4beb-9df7-378c5bf4a564
14,methods14," Furthermore, a systematic review suggests that environmental factors such as accessibility to supermarkets/takeaway outlets or residing in a socioeconomically disadvantaged area may contribute to obesogenic dietary behavior [37]. Finally, there is evidence suggesting that when food retail environments are unstable, low income areas are more affected by obesity than high income areas [38]. Thus, interventions on taxation of unhealthy foods supplemented with other policies such as subsidizing healthy foods could be helpful in preventing obesity [39,40,41]. Strategies focusing on fiscal measures (e.g., food vouchers for disadvantaged communities) and dietary standards [42] and healthy food promotion in retail environments may encourage healthy eating behavior in communities [43].  There is also good evidence showing an association between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and obesity (Path B).",2030d564-86c4-4ba0-9da3-22b22116ebe8
15,methods15," Unhealthy diet pattern has been associated with an increased risk of weight gain [44] or obesity [45,46]. By contrast, our recently published umbrella review of 16 systematic reviews showed that high adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was consistently associated with a decreased risk of obesity [12]. Previous research has shown that the nutrient-rich low-energy composition of the diet pattern defined using a high Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) [47] was associated with preventing weight gain in the long term [48]. Collectively, this evidence suggests that it may help slow or even reverse the rising prevalence of obesity in some countries. In addition, clinical trials show that there are health benefits of consuming a Mediterranean diet pattern beyond body weight status, such as better cardiovascular health [49,50] and overall mortality [51].  4.2.",00b8ec38-d33e-45f0-81f8-5237349da378
16,methods16," Study Strength and Limitation  The main strength of our study is that we used a subsample from a nationally conducted survey which collected measured height and weight data for accurate classification of obesity status. However, several limitations are noteworthy. First, we used dietary data from day one of 24-h recalls, which may not reflect the usual intake of study participants. Second, because of the cross-sectional design of the study, establishing temporality in exposure, mediator, and outcome variables means that interpretations of our findings should be cautious. Finally, there is no universal agreement on how to measure or define the Mediterranean diet.  5. Conclusions  Our findings suggest that unhealthy diet patterns could partially mediate the association between socio-economic disadvantage and obesity.",1a114f0f-a938-42fe-b387-195c991fc6d7
17,methods17," Public health policy and interventions to increase population-wide consumption of healthy diet patterns, such as the Mediterranean, in communities, especially those most disadvantaged groups in the society could help reduce the socio-economic inequalities of obesity.
