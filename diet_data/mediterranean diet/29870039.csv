0,background0,"Longevity has been steadily increasing over the past several decades. Life expectancy in 65-year old Israeli adults is ~ 20 years, leaving an ever expanding time window for the evolution of loss of health and function [1]. In western countries, the proportion of people over age 60 is increasing faster than any other group [2]. Diabetes rates (mainly type 2 diabetes mellitus -T2DM) are increasing in general and in older adults [4]. In the past the older population was characterized by low body weight and malnutrition in contrast to the present in which rates of obesity, metabolic syndrome and T2DM are increasing [3, 4]. Due to its chronic nature, T2DM presents a challenge to both patients and healthcare systems in maintaining adherence to treatment and accompanying lifestyle changes [5, 6].The risk for T2DM related complications is age related and is accompanied by functional limitation and comorbidities [7, 8].",d0cf8390-2671-4556-8bee-5ebf20db7ec5
1,background1," One morbidity associated with diabetes in the older population is sarcopenia [9] – a phenomenon of age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength and function. The decreased muscle mass is associated with loss of strength, increased likelihood of falls, and loss of autonomy [10].  Whereas weight reduction and physical activity are cornerstones of T2DM treatment and are likewise recommended as first-line treatment in adults [8], the older subpopulation is underrepresented in clinical trials [4]. Numerous diet regimens have been shown to improve T2DM control in relatively short clinical trials including the Mediterranean diet (Med-diet) [11], vegetarian / vegan [12, 13] and low-carb diets [12, 14, 15]. However, in older individuals, low-carb diets resulted in contradicting results [14, 15]; a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials (Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)s) comprising 1376 participants (age range 54–63 yrs.",190666f1-f00e-47c4-8854-614066506c30
2,background2,") showed that in the first year of intervention (3 or 6 months), a low carbohydrate diet (< 45% of total caloric consumption) was followed by a 0.34% lower HbA1c compared with a high carbohydrate diet (45–60% of total caloric consumption). However, at 1 year or later, HbA1c was similar in the two groups with higher dropout rates in the low carbohydrate diet groups [14]. Med-diet with a vegetarian pattern (the “vegeterranean” diet- V-Med diet) has a higher portion of carbohydrates when compared to low-carb diets, accompanied with high levels of fat (mainly unsaturated). To the best of our knowledge the V-Med diet has never been studied in older patients with T2DM.  In addition to diet, physical activity (PA) is an integral part of T2DM therapy, as it is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality [16].",72b09c80-1077-4122-b8b8-7830dc2bf08b
3,background3," However, adherence to exercise in older adults is low and studies in older adults performing unsupervised physical activity are scarce and have shown limited improvement in performance when compared to fully supervised programs [17, 18]. The cost of supervised training programs limits their widespread use and results in a need to develop more achievable evidence-based “shorter duration” home-training regimens [17] in older people with T2DM.  In addition to low adherence to PA, insulin resistance, a key pathogenic process in T2DM and a common condition in older individuals, is associated with “anabolic resistance”, which interferes with any attempted increase or preservation of skeletal muscle mass [19]. Anabolic resistance is associated with sarcopenic obesity and frailty [20] and requires careful management of weight reduction while performing PA [21].",45e08bc6-0f0f-4617-9223-3228c49e41f5
4,background4,"  Recently, we have shown that circuit resistance training (circuit resistance training (CRT)) is effective in increasing muscle mass and especially muscular strength in older adults with diverse health conditions [22]. circuit resistance training (CRT) performed with minimal supervision (performed in the patient’s home) was never studied in a Randomized Controlled Trial (Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)) in healthy or diabetic older individuals.  Empagliflozin is a new antihyperglycemic medication that induces glycosuria via inhibition of the renal sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) [23–25]. Independent of its anti-hyperglycemic effect, empagliflozin is cardio-protective in diabetic patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease [26, 27].",3a3b4e11-a8a0-42ab-bf3c-95871079464f
5,background5," Treatment with empagliflozin and other SGLT-2 inhibitors results in weight loss (through urinary caloric loss) and potential compensatory hyperphagia without a significant change in resting metabolic rate (resting metabolic rate (RMR)) [24, 25, 28, 29].  In this study we aim to compare the effect of a V-Med diet, circuit resistance training (CRT) and empagliflozin separately or in combination on metabolic and anthropometric parameters in older subjects with T2DM. Both SGLT2 inhibitors and exercise lead to increased caloric expenditure and compensatory hyperphagia; SGLT2 inhibitors and diet lead to weight loss and all three interventions reduce insulin resistance and lower circulating insulin levels [30, 31]. Therefore, the combination of and comparison among these diverse approaches to metabolic control may lead to better understanding of their mechanism of action with potential clinical implications in older individuals.",43208dd3-56ba-43f5-a0ca-4ea00c1f701b
6,background6,"  In conclusion, treatment of the older diabetic individual comprises a therapeutic challenge. Currently little scientific evidence exists depicting the best approach to T2DM treatment in this growing sub-population of patients. In this study we aim to better quantify the short-term effects of diet, physical activity and drug therapy, alone or in combination, on metabolic and anthropometric parameters as well as on physical function in older individuals with T2DM.  Objectives The aim of the study is to assess the effects of different medical treatment modalities for T2DM, separately and combined in community dwelling older subjects, on metabolic, functional and anthropometric parameters.",20e1e26b-5871-4b8d-a1eb-d4bdc15f42d3

Hypothesis 1 We expect that the increase in lean body mass (lean body mass (LBM)) will be superior in the circuit resistance training (CRT) arm vs. the other groups after 10 weeks. After 20 weeks the relative increase in lean body mass (LBM) will be higher in the V-Med diet + circuit resistance training (CRT) compared to the empagliflozin + circuit resistance training (CRT) group.

18,background18,"  Intervention Circuit resistance training (circuit resistance training (CRT)) Traditionally, the recommendations for physical activity in older adults (given by the ACSM and AHA) include 150 min of moderate intensity aerobic exercise/week and at least two resistance training exercise sessions (~ 60–90 min/session) /week [35]. As resistance training is considered to be the most appropriate form of intervention to decelerate muscle mass and strength loss [35] and keeping in mind the low adherence to the PA recommendations [17] we chose to focus on resistance exercise in the form of circuit resistance training (CRT). In this study subjects will be allocated to circuit resistance training (CRT) which consists of 10 resistance exercises for different body parts (=1 circuit) repeated 12–15 times, using modest weights (approximately 40–60% of one repetition maximum, RM). Each exercise is expected to be completed within 30–40 s.",37048a37-9bfa-4a78-97a7-ac11396f380d

Blood tests Hormonal profile of each subject will be obtained at each study period and will include: LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), bioavailable and free testosterone, insulin, IGF-1 and 25-hydroxy vitamin D. FPG and HbA1C levels will be obtained from HMO’s records (up to 3 months before the study and at week 10 and 20). For future examinations frozen plasma and blood samples from patients will be stored and kept at − 20 °C and − 80 °C respectively.  Adverse events An adverse event (AE) is considered as any unexpected and untoward event or medical occurrence in a participant that is related or not necessarily related to the treatment allocated in the study. AEs will be monitored in all study arms. Decision on the relation of event and the protocol will be made and documented.",e4e1c861-5aef-4614-89cd-49004b8779cf
35,background35," AEs will be classified by their severity (mild/ moderate/ severe), their causality (relation to the treatment: probable/ possible/ unlikely) and their outcome (resolved/ resolving/ resolved with sequelae – a lasting effect of the AE/ fatal). Every 2 weeks the subjects will be contacted by telephone and conduct an interview that will be documented in an AE log.  Discontinuation Participants may withdraw consent for any reason at any time or be discontinued from the trial by the investigator if based upon his clinical judgment, continuation in the trial is deemed inappropriate. In addition, a subject may be discontinued by the investigator if enrollment into the trial is inappropriate, the trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.

36,methods0,"One hundred and twenty men and women ≥65 years of age with type 2 diabetes, and low levels of physical activity will be randomized (1:1:1 manner, gender stratified) for 10 weeks to one of 3 parallel arms: circuit resistance training (CRT) consisting of 3 home sessions/week; ad-libitum plant-based Mediterranean diet (limited consumption of eggs, dairy and fish, avoidance of red meat and poultry) or empagliflozin 10 mg/day. After 10 weeks circuit resistance training (CRT) will be added to the empagliflozin and diet arms for an additional 10 weeks. Allocation concealment and blinding of primary outcome assessors will be implemented. Efficacy will be determined by assessment of lean body mass, body weight, frailty and functional status, sarcopenia, HbA1c and quality of life questionnaires. Safety will be evaluated by routine monitoring of adverse events. This study was approved by the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center Institutional Review Board. ",c2851f1d-d260-4309-aeb5-fef5ddbc396e
37,analysis0,"Sample size The sample size calculation is based on the assumption that the mean difference in weight after 10 weeks between the empagliflozin arm and the circuit resistance training (CRT) arm will be − 3.2 Kg. We assumed that the weight will not change in the circuit resistance training (CRT) only group (body composition may change) and, based on the literature, that empagliflozin treatment causes a reduction in weight of ≈ 3–3.5 Kg. For 80% power and significance level of 5% each arm should include 40 subjects (n = 120 total). Another calculation was based on ANOVA for the comparison of three groups. We assumed that body fat % at the end of study will be 37, 36 and 40% for the diet, drug and circuit resistance training (CRT) arms, respectively, with a 6% SD in each group. These assumptions are based on unpublished data obtained in a pilot study conducted in the institute of Endocrinology Metabolism and Hypertension (IEMH).",3d459d8b-0a73-45bc-a312-c8e98acf3b4f
38,analysis1, Assuming an attrition of ~ 10% we intend to recruit 120 up to 140 participants. Power calculations were performed using the G*Power Statistical Power Analyses for Windows [53].  Definition of main outcomes Relative lean mass change will be calculated as % lean mass (the proportion of lean mass out of weight) at the end of study minus % lean mass at baseline divided by lean mass % at baseline and multiplied by 100. Change in body weight (%) will be calculated as body weight at the end of 10 weeks (and 20 weeks) minus baseline body weight divided by body weight at baseline and multiplied by 100.

For comparison of dichotomous or categorical variables the Chi square test will be performed.  The primary endpoints (% change in lean body mass (LBM) and change in weight) will be analyzed using the analysis of covariance (analyzed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)) after 10 weeks and after 20 weeks (for diet and drug arms only) including several factors and covariates.

46,discussion0,"Our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of three different interventions (V-Med diet, circuit resistance training (CRT) and empagliflozin, separately or in combination) on metabolic, anthropometric and physical function parameters in older subjects with T2DM. Several new facets of T2DM treatment in this age group are at the core of this study: 1. This is the first comparison of empagliflozin to lifestyle modification in older patients; 2. This is the first evaluation of a multistage lifestyle and empagliflozin therapy interventions on frailty and sarcopenia; 3. Our hybrid diet intervention (V-Med diet) has thus far not been tested in conjunction to circuit resistance training (CRT) or compared to other treatment modalities; 4.This is the first study to assess the effect of a circuit resistance training (CRT) program in older subjects with T2DM.",8c3f281a-3f8b-4279-97ba-86cf9e92d7d2
47,discussion1,"  There are, however, several limitations to our study protocol: 1) the possibility for volunteer bias which might lead to the inclusion of highly engaged patients. This may affect only the external validity of the study, but not its internal validity; 2) the exclusion criteria include several co-morbidities that are likely prevalent in the older age and associated with diabetes such as recent stroke or myocardial infraction. While this may minimize the generalization of our results, subjects with these conditions may not benefit from our interventions; 3) the apparently narrow HbA1C range used as an inclusion criterion (6.5–8%), may also limit the generalization of our results at this age group.",5e8b800e-3f6f-4996-8a3f-3596037b86d4
48,discussion2," Still, we wish to minimize the effect of major reduction in glycemic values per se (associated with higher values of HbA1C at entry for the study) as a potential contributor to any observed improvements in functional and metabolic states; 4) given its relatively short duration and limited sample size the study is unlikely to evaluate morbidity outcomes such as the incidence of myocardial infraction or stroke.  The combination and comparison of the three interventions for metabolic control may lead to better understanding of their mechanism of action with potential clinical implications in older subjects with T2DM. This study may also provide evidence of the effectiveness of different interventions on the progression from diabetes to sarcopenia and/or frailty and their potential effect on the quality of life older subjects with T2DM.
