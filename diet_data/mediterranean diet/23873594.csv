0,background0,"The diagnosis of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes can reduce a person’s life expectancy by 8-10 years [1] and quality of life, particularly as a result of complications [2,3]. However, morbidity and mortality related to diabetes can be attenuated by a 15 - 20% reduction in body weight [1]. It is also possible, through lifestyle interventions, to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in ‘at risk’ individuals with pre-diabetes [3].  Lack of adherence to the weight loss plan prescribed is one of the challenges when recommending dietary modifications to free-living individuals. In dietary interventions, compliance and motivation of the participant generally decrease over time, regardless of the dietary regimen prescribed [4,5]. Changing a dietary pattern when it is either failing or because of boredom may produce a better result than forcing the participant to persist with the same pattern or drop out.",edef876e-26f7-452a-8741-59c7dcccb768
1,background1," Behavioural choice theory suggests that patients who receive the treatment that they prefer will have better outcomes in the context of a behavioural modification [6]. In chronic conditions, and particularly with regard to dietary modifications, the involvement and preferences of the patient may be particularly important as treatments are likely to require considerable long term lifestyle changes. Normal clinical practice is rarely as flexible as this with few practitioners endeavouring to determine patient needs and likes but we believe this is essential for long term success. Few lifestyle intervention studies have investigated choice or preference of treatment in terms of obesity and they have mostly been short in duration or small in size. In a small pilot study, Murray [7] found no differences between the group who received their preference and those who did not.",9ee55752-80b5-4117-a41f-5f6ab676db44
2,background2," Similarly, Renjilian found no difference comparing those who received their preferred treatment (group or individual therapy) for obesity and group therapy was far more successful [8]. It is possible in this study that the power of group therapy trumps the loss of choice. In contrast to the behavioural choice theory, Burke et al. in a large 18 month study found that those who received their preference had less weight loss than those who did not [9]. A larger two year study by Borridale et al.[10] found that those who did not receive their preference did significantly better than those who did. No gender effects were explored. Thus overall the literature would suggest that choice has either no effect or counterintuitively leads to worse outcomes in obesity trials. This may relate to the reasons people have become obese in which free choice is clearly detrimental.  No dietary preference weight loss studies have been performed dealing specifically with diabetes or pre–diabetes.",0f20fb62-7800-4aa0-bf17-5005e2f5ef1b
3,background3," To our knowledge there have also been no dietary intervention studies investigating preference of treatment that have allowed subjects to change diets during the intervention. Weight loss is greater in men than in women in most studies, including those in people with type 2 diabetes [11]. In the present work, we conducted a 12 month weight loss study in people with diabetes and pre-diabetes with the hypothesis that giving the participant the ability to choose from and interchange between a selection of diets, as opposed to being prescribed a set diet throughout, will (i) reduce dropout rates, and (ii) lead to improved weight loss and cardio-metabolic outcomes. We expected men would lose more weight than women and that weight loss would be greater with dietary choice in both groups. ",b13aae83-ead9-4889-bd0e-94309c1e2350

Potential participants were posted a brief summary of the principles of each of the three diets and were further able to view the diet plans during a pre-enrolment information session where they were told that all three diets had been shown to be effective in weight loss, with no bias towards any one diet. At the information session, participants gave consent and selected their diet of choice should they be randomly allocated to the Choice group.

No dietetic professionals were used. Both knowledge transfer about the diet composition as well as motivation was explored in the diet sessions. Behavioural issues such as snacking and alcohol use which would be common to all diets were explored.  Primary outcomes were weight and HbA1c.

The present study investigated whether patient freedom to choose a weight loss diet and later change to a different diet (if desired) would lead to increased weight loss and/or improvements in HbA1c .  Participants in the choice group rarely changed diets The fact that only five participants in the Choice group elected to change diets was an unexpected outcome and an important finding given the ability to change diets during a weight loss intervention has not been investigated previously. Instead of changing diets, participants not achieving their weight loss or health goals preferred to withdraw entirely from the study.",ce41d269-cca6-4e1d-a3a7-b2dab59cefca
30,discussion1," This may have been because participants in the Choice group had already chosen the diet that they viewed as most likely to give them success or that participants in the Choice group had an inflated expectation of success compared to those in the No Choice group. The latter is consistent with other lifestyle intervention studies where participants who had the ability to select diets performed poorly compared to those who did not [10], [16]. In the present study, there was no significant difference in Choice and No Choice groups with respect to withdrawal rates or the proportion of participants in each group who received their diet of choice.  Gender differences in diet preference, attrition rates and weight loss Overall, males were well represented in the study and outnumbered the women. A key finding in the present study was the gender differences that existed with relation to dietary preference in terms of diet selection and weight loss outcomes.",bb77e3ca-42e7-4769-ab61-23c389d51842
31,discussion2,"  Gender differences in initial diet preference The strong male bias towards SB may have been due to a preference for animal protein amongst men, its simplicity (all foods were designated as ‘allowed’ or ‘not allowed’) or non-calorie restricted design. Men, however, coped poorly with this diet and either dropped out or had poor weight loss but even excluding this diet from the analysis showed that men did worse with choice. Women strongly preferred CSIRO. Other studies have shown that women are more likely to sacrifice their dietary regimen for their family’s food preference [17] and CSIRO was viewed by many participants as being ‘family friendly’. It is plausible that the women in our study, most likely responsible for the nutrition of the household, took into greater account the acceptability of the diet by other (particularly younger) family members than the men did.  Gender differences in familial support A recent study by Mathew et al.",dce483cc-18cf-4dd0-95ac-2f0f3d051d0b
32,discussion3," [18] highlights the struggles with diet and nutrition among women in diabetes self-management. Other previous work is consistent in that women are supportive of their husband’s dietary changes and diabetes self-management, whilst men are less supportive of their wife in this regard [19,20]. Female participants more often complained about the lack of familial support and family pressures, including their family’s dislike at having to eat differently, which hindered their own compliance.  Gender differences in weight loss The observed diet group (Choice or No Choice) by time by gender interaction suggests that both gender and its interaction with the option to choose or not choose between weight loss diets are important determinants of weight loss success. The results presented here support a gender-specific approach when offering nutritional advice for weight loss and diabetes management.",de30f010-f324-49cb-93c3-e90b57595cd6
33,discussion4," Specifically, our findings suggest that men may achieve better weight loss outcomes when given a single option. Although our data suggest that offering an array of options to men for weight loss may not lead to the best outcome for the group, clearly within the group there would be many men who would welcome and do better with an array of choices. Some practitioners would also not be comfortable offering only one solution to men. The reasons for men to not do as well with a choice of diets and the ability to change diets is not clear but may relate to lack of confidence in decision making about food and a lack of knowledge compared with women. Dietary advice was given by an Honours student and a Nutrition PhD. No dietetic professionals were used. Both knowledge transfer about the diet composition as well as motivation was explored in the diet sessions.",f2b80648-c054-421b-a153-4d83e0336d02
34,discussion5, Behavioural issues such as snacking and alcohol use which would be common to all diets were explored even when those in the No Choice group who received their desired diet were removed from the analysis there was still a diet by time by gender interaction ie the loss of choice was the most important factor rather than the diet per se. Although in experimental tests of decision making with a variety of scenarios there are no differences between men and women [21] but with patients surveyed after an acute ischemic event men were reported to be more satisfied with the information received while women wanted more information although both agreed that only a minority of decision making was shared although this is what they both wanted. This suggests men were more content with the reality of following doctors decision [22].,e26f2c17-a3de-4749-b169-0238cfff51f5
35,discussion6," In weight loss studies once a man has made a decision that weight loss is required (which they do much less often than women) they are much more successful at achieving weight loss regardless of the dietary intervention.  Limitations of the present study This study was limited by a lack of diet records, measures of satisfaction and a lack of alternative diets in the No Choice group to ensure no one in this group was given their desired diet. Underlying personal traits or behaviors related to the type of diet a person chose may have also effected their success in implementing behavioral lifestyle changes (as opposed to the actual diet plan). For example, people who enjoy cooking, previously shown to be a factor in successful weight management [23], may have chosen CSIRO whilst people who do not make good food choices may have preferred the ‘black and white’ rules of excluding carbohydrate in SB.",3432b898-d25a-4860-803e-bd77244287ee
36,discussion7," Some individuals may have lost considerable weight regardless of the diet due to possessing a good support network, or the necessary skills and behaviors likely to lead to success. Despite the researchers’ best efforts to be impartial, there may have been bias in the nutritional counseling provided to one group (e.g. diet, gender, diet group) over another. Participants themselves may have had perceptions of what the best diet or diet group was and this may have influenced or been influenced by other participants during group sessions.  Conclusions In conclusion, the option to change dietary patterns did not improve retention rates in this weight loss intervention, although gender differences exist in terms of diet selection and weight loss outcomes. For men, clear direction was important. Current dietetic practice generally places little emphasis on gender-specific approaches when offering nutritional advice for weight loss and diabetes management.",22ed8166-835c-49b1-8592-4129698a42a6
37,discussion8, This is particularly pertinent in the case of women with chronic physical medical conditions who may be attempting to make lifestyle changes without their family’s support or willingness to adapt to different dietary patterns. Prescribing a set weight loss regimen to such a patient without consideration of such familial obstacles is more likely to be ineffective and may in fact contribute to the person’s low self-esteem (and further weight gain) from repeated failed weight loss attempts.
