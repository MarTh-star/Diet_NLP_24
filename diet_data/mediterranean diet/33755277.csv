0,abstract0," Anthracyclines are standard‐of‐care chemotherapy for the treatment of triple‐negative breast cancer (triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC)). However, high anthracyclines cumulative doses increase heart failure risk. Designing therapeutic strategies that ameliorate cardiac toxicities without compromising oncologic efficacy are important to improve triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) outcomes and survivorship. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of diet on triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) chemotherapeutic responsiveness and development of chemotherapy‐induced cardiac damage. Female BALB/c mice fed a control, Western, Mediterranean, or Western + fish oil diet were injected with 1 × 106 4T1‐luciferase triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) into the mammary fat pad. Tumors grew for 21 days before surgical tumor resection, then mice were treated with 3.3 mg/kg i.v. doxorubicin for 3 weeks.

Consumption of a high‐fat diet increased triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) growth regardless of dietary pattern. Western diet‐fed mice developed lung metastases sooner and displayed increased lung metastatic lesion formation, which was not observed in Mediterranean diet‐fed mice. Western diet‐fed animals displayed worse cardiac function when compared with Mediterranean diet‐fed animals. Hearts from Western diet‐fed animals displayed increased fibrosis.

Triple‐negative breast cancer (triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC)) represents around 10–15% of all breast cancer cases and predominately affects young and minority women .",085281b5-996d-47ba-a644-6208dcfd7fb1
5,abstract5," triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly aggressive and currently has no targeted therapeutic options, thereby limiting patients to chemotherapy . Several studies have demonstrated a strong link between obesity and increased risk of developing premenopausal triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Pierobon & Frankenfeld, 2013; Sun et al., 2017). Furthermore, some studies reported a three‐fold higher mortality rate in obese women at diagnosis , indicating the important role obesity plays in modulating therapeutic responsiveness, promoting metastases, and/or the development of off‐target toxicities that limit treatment to decrease breast cancer survival .  In the United States, there are over 3.8 million breast cancer survivors, making the unique long‐term health concerns of this population a health priority.",8a389cf0-8f76-4b5e-99d2-5f3a24706432
6,abstract6," Breast cancer survivors face a greater burden of non‐cancer chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, compared to their cancer‐free peers, leading to excess morbidity and reduced quality of life (Bradshaw et al., 2016; Gernaat et al., 2017; Patnaik et al., 2011, 2011). Anthracycline‐based strategies remain the standard chemotherapy for adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment of triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Isakoff, 2010). However, high cumulative doses of anthracyclines increase the risk of congestive heart failure (Jensen, 2006; McGowan et al., 2017). Although it is well established that anthracyclines cause cardiac damage, there is a gap in understanding mechanisms of cardiotoxicity and markers of susceptibility. Due to the clinical benefit of chemotherapy, it is now essential to find novel strategies to ameliorate side effects without compromising oncologic efficacy.",33897fd7-a1e4-45ac-9bf1-bd8b79093f4e
7,abstract7,"  The Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet (Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED)) evaluated the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the prevention of cardiovascular disease . The results of an interim analysis prompted early termination of the trial due to reductions in the cardiovascular event rates in the intervention groups. The Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) study reported that consumption of the Mediterranean diet supplement with extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) and tree nuts lowered the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer by 51%. In another study assessing adherence to the Mediterranean diet and breast cancer risk, the Mediterranean diet was reported to reduce the risk of estrogen receptor‐negative breast cancer (Turati et al.",b0283a35-3c36-464a-9058-1b919f5a01c1
8,abstract8,", 2018), suggesting Mediterranean diet consumption reduces triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) breast cancer risk.  Due to the promising data on diet influencing the development of breast cancer and heart disease, we wanted to determine the impact of dietary patterns on chemotherapy‐induced cardiac dysfunction. We aimed to concurrently explore different dietary patterns effects on primary triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor growth, the development of metastatic lesions, the response to chemotherapy, and the development of doxorubicin‐induced cardiac damage. To do so, we employed two different triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) models (4T1 and MDA‐MB‐231) consuming four different diets (standard rodent control diet, Western diet, Mediterranean diet, and a Western + Fish oil diet). We show that consuming a high‐fat diet increases primary breast tumor growth. However, the Mediterranean diet reduces lung metastatic burden and prevents the development of cardiac dysfunction.",817be051-d913-4950-aa49-2bf3f5d16d09

At 8‐weeks of age, mice were injected with 1 × 106 4T1‐luciferase breast cancer cells in the left inguinal fat pad. Primary tumor growth was monitored by IVIS and calipers weekly for 21 days. Primary tumors were then resected and IVIS imaging performed to confirm complete tumor removal. One week after tumor resection, mice received 3.3 mg/kg doxorubicin (DOX) I.V. for 3 weeks (cumulative dose of 9.9 mg/kg doxorubicin (DOX)), and the development of breast cancer lung metastases was monitored by weekly IVIS imaging.

12,methods4," M‐mode short‐axis images were obtained to assess ejection fraction and fractional shortening. Mitral valve early filling velocities (E) and septal annular velocities (e’) were obtained using pulsed Doppler and tissue Doppler, respectively. E/e’ was calculated as an index of left ventricular (LV) filling pressure. To determine arterial stiffness the pulse wave velocity was calculated as follows: PWV = Distance (D)/Time (T), where D is the distance in mm between the ascending aorta site to descending aorta site and T = (R point of the EKG to the foot of the ascending aorta flow) − (R point of the EKG to the foot of the descending aorta flow) in msec . Cardiac function was measured in matched animals at 7 weeks of age, 10 weeks of age (tumor‐bearing), and 14 weeks of age (1 week post last doxorubicin (DOX) injection). At 14 weeks of age, the study was terminated, and mouse lung weight and heart weight were recorded.",2586b557-d029-4779-959d-895c97e74683

31,results16," IVIS visualization also revealed that doxorubicin (DOX) decreased metastatic lesion size in Control diet, Mediterranean diet, and Western + Fish oil diet‐fed mice, but not in Western diet‐fed mice (Figure 5c). Visualized results were confirmed by lung weight. Lung weight was significantly increased in all tumor‐bearing mice, regardless of diet (Figure 5d). Diet and doxorubicin (DOX) treatment did not have a discernible effect on lung weight in tumor‐free lungs. Tumors significantly increased the mass of lungs from mice fed all diets. Western diet‐fed mouse lungs containing tumors were significantly heavier than the tumor‐bearing lungs of mice fed Control diet, matching observations from IVIS imaging.  doxorubicin (DOX) treatment was effective in reducing tumor burden, as measured by lung weight, in Control diet and Mediterranean diet‐fed mice (Figure 5d).",732f5ecc-1f2f-4964-8b5e-a4bb0fa8d6fd
32,results17," Post‐doxorubicin (DOX) treatment, lungs from mice fed Control diet and Mediterranean diet were not significantly different in weight from their respective doxorubicin (DOX)‐treated lungs without tumors. Lungs from mice fed Western diet or Western + Fish oil diet were still significantly heavier post‐doxorubicin (DOX) treatment compared to their respective tumor‐free doxorubicin (DOX) treated samples.  The cardiac effects of doxorubicin (DOX) treatment were assessed by measuring heart weight, which was then normalized to tibia length to account for differences in body size. doxorubicin (DOX) treatment significantly increased the heart weight/tibia length ratio in Control diet‐fed mice, and to a greater extent, in Western diet‐fed animals. This suggests western diet elevated doxorubicin (DOX)‐induced cardiac hypertrophy. These changes were not found in mice fed Mediterranean nor Western + Fish oil diets (Figure 5e).  4 ",f095bb32-a86c-496c-8bf1-39a2cfa9aa56
33,discussion0,"  Our findings demonstrate the impact of diet on the progression of triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC); the ability of diet to modulate chemotherapy anti‐tumor efficacy; and the impact of diet on the development of chemotherapy dose‐limiting cardiac toxicities. This study demonstrates that not only is the level of fat content in a diet significant, but that the type of fat in a diet impacts these parameters as well. Elevated fat consumption increased body weight and body fat percent in both models used in this study. Additionally, increased weight was associated with a poor blood glucose regulation, as often observed in humans, which further compounded the deleterious effects of a high‐fat diet. In all cases, the high‐fat Western diet had the greatest impact on overall health, be it body fat percent, glucose tolerance, or cardiac function. These models allow us to simultaneously investigate the effects of diet, obesity, and associated co‐morbidities on breast cancer survival.",63e77e7e-fdb9-4892-8490-dd118266fa9c
34,discussion1," The role of obesity on relapse‐free survival, and overall survival, is unclear. Some studies suggest obesity does not affect relapse‐free survival or overall survival of triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients , though not all studies agree . However, there appears to be a consensus that obesity reduces therapeutic response in triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Bonsang‐Kitzis et al., 2015; Naik et al., 2019), as was found in our preclinical study. These factors, combined with the increased risk of cardiac damage in obese patients with breast cancer , make this model, and protecting cardiac tissue from therapeutic damage, all the more vital to understand.  The type of fat consumed in a high‐fat diet differentially affected the two mouse models used in this study. BALB/c mice appear to be more sensitive to high fat consumption when compared with athymic nu/nu nude mice.",f8899d41-c48e-4b0d-9b8c-d7f9ba5f45f1
35,discussion2," All three intervention diets increased BALB/c body fat percent and body weight, while athymic nu/nu nude mice appear only susceptible to increased body fat via Western diet. Neither Mediterranean diet nor Western diet supplemented with fish oil led to an increase in body fat percent in nu/nu nude mice. These findings follow the well‐documented importance of genetic background and adipose‐immune‐inflammation interactions as regulators of an individual's response to a high‐fat diet .  Consumption of a high‐fat diet increased the growth rate and size of primary tumors in the 4T1 BALB/c model, regardless of dietary pattern. This matches trends found in other 4T1‐high fat diet studies ; though it is notable the source of fat calories varies between these reports. Western diet was notably the most detrimental, leading to the highest rate of tumor growth and the largest tumor size.",d285832d-bc56-44f6-8d56-39ad8fce50e6
36,discussion3," Western diet‐fed mice were the first to develop lung metastases and were the only mice to have an increased lung weight. It is unclear whether this is due to diet‐induced metastases growth, inhibition of doxorubicin (DOX) treatment efficacy, or a combination of both. Similar results were found in the MDA‐MB‐231 metastasis nu/nu mouse model, where Western diet‐fed mice developed the largest tumors and had the highest lung weight. However, in this nu/nu model, both Mediterranean diet and supplementing Western diet with fish oil reduced lung metastasis compared to the 4T1 BALB/c model where only Mediterranean diet reduced lung metastatic lesion number. This may be due to differences in the mouse model immunogenicity and/or the primary triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line.  Diet was a significant factor in the efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX) treatment.",04b4c9ef-3f2c-4432-b37f-a2e0cd4efa0c
37,discussion4," In the MDA‐MB‐231 nu/nu nude mouse model, doxorubicin (DOX) treatment prevented growth or reduced lung metastases size in Control diet and Mediterranean diet‐fed mice so effectively that tumor‐bearing lung weight was the same as no‐tumor lung weight. This was not true of Western diet or Western + Fish oil diet‐fed mice, who still had a significant increase in lung mass post‐doxorubicin (DOX) treatment. This suggests Western diet reduces doxorubicin (DOX) efficacy. However, addition of fish oil to the Western diet background did improved doxorubicin (DOX) response compared to Western diet‐fed animal responses. Similar conclusions can be drawn from the 4T1 BALB/c model, though not as definitively. It is difficult to determine whether the differences in lung mass are a result of diet affecting doxorubicin (DOX) efficacy, metastatic lesion proliferation/apoptosis, or a combination of both.",afc3a95a-8bfa-41e3-99dc-62a4b0008166
38,discussion5,"  Finally, diet was a significant regulator of cardiac health alone and cardiac damage mediated by doxorubicin (DOX) administration. Western diet and Western + Fish oil diet resulted in reduced cardiac diastolic function. Supplementing fish oil appears to be partially protective to the heart, in regards to systolic function preservation. These findings are consistent with some of the published data (reviewed in Serini et al., 2017). It is noteworthy that these studies are not ideal comparisons, as they utilize rats and sheep and different methodology than this study. Some studies showed PUFA supplementation showed no effect or increases anthracycline‐induced cardiac damage . However, other studies found PUFA supplementation to be protective of anthracycline‐induced cardiac damage (Schjott et al., 1996; Teng et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2013).",2d7d4732-29a5-4f01-a61d-3c6c5b91537f
39,discussion6," PUFA and anthracycline dosage level and methodology appear to be significant factors in whether PUFA supplementation is protective or harmful. The study that indicates harmful effects was performed in sheep where the placebo was olive oil (high in monounsaturated fatty acids, previously shown to have health benefits) and a lower cumulative dose of doxorubicin (DOX) (3.6 mg/kg), which may confound data outcome interpretation . While fish oil supplementation was found to be protective in this current study, further investigation of the cardio‐protective capabilities of PUFA is required with careful consideration of dose (sub‐optimal doses would not result in bioavailability and supra‐pharmacological doses would not be achievable in clinical population) and timing (administration of PUFA before or after doxorubicin (DOX) exposure may lead to differential results).",89b613d6-a56a-42eb-8849-a1b5c1ead4b8
40,discussion7," Consumption of a Mediterranean diet improved both diastolic and systolic cardiac function when compared with Western diet‐fed subjects in response to chemotherapy, suggesting further dietary benefits of olive oil consumption or reduction in sugar intake in modulating chemotherapy‐mediated cardiotoxicities.  Breast cancer patients often experience accelerated bone loss as a side effect of systemic anti‐cancer therapies (Ramaswamy & Shapiro, 2003). doxorubicin (DOX) was reported to induce bone damage potentially leading to increased bone fracture risk . We show that consumption of a Western diet in combination with doxorubicin (DOX) administration led to a significant reduction in bone fraction (Figure S1) that was not observed in mice consuming Mediterranean diet, suggesting that diet may also play a key role in doxorubicin (DOX)‐mediated bone damage as another off‐target side effect induced by systemic chemotherapy.",66e9dfd4-7d2e-4b82-8808-14b342f8bc3c
41,discussion8,"  These studies give general insight into the consequences of a Western diet on breast cancer progression, poor treatment efficacy, and cardiac damage. Supplementation with fish oil, and thus decrease in the n‐6:n‐3 ratio, was partially protective in some areas but did not fully prevent the aforementioned effects. Consumption of a Mediterranean diet while undergoing chemotherapy was more efficacious in reducing triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) lung metastatic burden while simultaneously improving cardiac function when compared to doxorubicin (DOX)‐treated Western diet‐consuming subjects. Furthermore, understanding how diet affects cancer development and therapeutic outcomes is important in the age of individualized medicine. Given the societal and fiscal constraints on diet modification, these alternative strategies may be more deployable or easier to be made available.",626980e8-1e7d-42c7-802f-f51045dd496f
42,discussion9,"  5 STUDY LIMITATIONS  There are always study limitations that influence the outcomes and translational ability of the research. Our preclinical model uses young female BALB/c mice. While triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) predominately affects younger women, this study may not accurately represent dietary influences in postmenopausal triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Furthermore, it is well established that the BALB/c strain is resistant to diet‐induced obesity, which is observed in our study (animals on high‐fat diets do not surpass the 30% body fat composition that defines obesity). Therefore, our study portrays the effects of diets (independent of obesity) on triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) growth, metastatic potential, doxorubicin (DOX)‐efficacy, and cardiac dysfunction.",52607a28-cee7-4736-9039-c70f581b08d3
43,discussion10," It is also important to note potential causal and temporal confounders of this study, mice bearing‐larger lung metastases would display impaired lung volume and have a greater impact on cardiac function. Therefore, the reduction in ejection fraction observed in Western diet consuming animal may represent indirect effects mediated by lung capacity. However, this is a translational relevant model as stage IV metastatic breast cancer patients may also develop cardiac toxicities.  6 CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE  The findings in this study agree with the general consensus of the field that diets high in salt, sugar, and saturated fats increase tumor growth and metastases, while concurrently decreasing doxorubicin (DOX) anti‐tumor efficacy. Few studies investigate dietary effects on both tumor and heart simultaneously. We now show in a tumor‐bearing model how diet can affect cancer therapy sequelae, such as chemotherapy‐induced cardiac damage.",84d2d742-4b01-4386-a11f-1217089c1036
44,discussion11," In light of these findings, it is important that the general public be made aware of the influence of diet on health and that breast cancer patients are made to understand the importance of diet regulation during treatment.
