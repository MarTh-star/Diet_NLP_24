2,methods2,"  After inclusion, participants were randomly allocated to one of the following three groups:Conventional diet (CD) group: These participants followed the recommendations of American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD)) [30], with energy restrictions to loss of at least 3–5% of the body weight to improve steatosis and 7–10% to improve most of the histopathological features of non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), following the general guidelines of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture (20–35% fat, 10–35% protein, 45–65% carbohydrate) [31].  Mediterranean diet high meal frequency (MD-HMF) group: This group was instructed to follow a Mediterranean diet characterized by a distribution of macronutrients of 40–45% carbohydrates (50–70% of carbohydrates should be low glycemic and rich in fiber), 30–35% fat, and 25% protein.",34297e42-c0d5-433d-8902-225252cdad97
3,methods3," This dietary pattern was previously observed to decrease fat mass and overall weight and improve the oxidative status in subjects with metabolic syndrome [32,33]. Total daily caloric intake was distributed over seven meals, with the highest calorie meals eaten early during the morning.  Mediterranean diet physical activity (MD-PA) group: This group consumed an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet with a meal frequency of four to five meals per day, including snacks. Total calorie intake for this group came from 35–40% from fat (8–10% of saturated fatty acids, >20% of monounsaturated fatty acids, >10% of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and <300 mg/day of cholesterol), about 20% from proteins, and 40–45% or more from carbohydrates (mainly with low glycemic index). Sodium chloride should not reach 6 g/day (2.4 g of sodium), and dietary fiber should be no less than 30–35 g/day [34].",0ddff756-bb4b-4bf3-afea-96d19261089a
4,methods4,"  The CD and MD-HMF groups were instructed to perform at least 10,000 steps a day [19], and the MD-PA group was instructed to undergo 35 min interval training session three times a week as previously described [35]. The three nutritional interventions were characterized by an energy reduction of 25–30% of baseline calories intake and increase energy expenditure by 400 kcal/70 kg (5.7 kcal per kg of body weight). The adherence to the Mediterranean diet (adherence to the Mediterranean diet (ADM)) was assessed using a validated 17-item questionnaire at the beginning and after 6 months of intervention [36].  2.2. Anthropometric Characterization  Weight (kg) was determined with a calibrated scale with the patients barefoot and light clothing, therefore subtracting 0.6 kg for their clothing. Height was measured with a mobile anthropometer (Seca 214, SECA Deutschland, Hamburg, Germany) to the nearest millimeter, keeping the patient’s head in the Frankfort horizontal plane position.",c487cb1d-6d9e-42dc-92e2-c0756e20b3b8

Briefly, samples and Malondialdehyde (MDA) standard were positioned in tubes holding n-methyl-2-phenylindole in acetonitrile: methanol (3:1). Then, HCL (12N) was added, and tubes were incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. Finally, the absorbance was determined at 586 nm.  2.6. Protein Carbonyl Determination  Protein carbonyl derivatives were determined by an OxiSelectTM Protein Carbonyl Immunoblot Kit (CELL BIOLABS®, San Jose, CA, USA) following the supplied guidelines for use. The total protein levels in the samples were determined by the Bradford method [41] using a commercial reagent (Merck Life Science S.L.U., Madrid, Spain).",5980ef58-7b5c-4a3a-a45f-e1442e187dcd

Cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) concentration was determined using the M30 Apoptoense® ELISA kit following the guidelines for use (PEVIVA®, in USA, Canada, and Japan). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were determined in plasma using Human Custom ProcartaPlexTM (Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bender MedSystems GmbH, Vienna, Austria) following the manufacturers’ instructions.  2.8. Statistics  Analyses were carried out with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics with mean ± SD (standard deviation) for participants’ baseline characteristics were used.",86ed82c1-a38a-401f-8823-dcf7e33a5239
10,methods10," Participants were classified in tertiles according to 6 months changed in intrahepatic fat content (IFC) (T1: <−0.567, n = 20; T2: −0.567 to −7.13, n = 20; T3: >−7.13, n = 20). Differences among baseline characteristics according to tertiles of intrahepatic fat content (IFC) were tested with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis when variables followed normal distribution or with Kruskal–Wallis test for non-normally distributed variables. Results were considered statistically significant if p-value < 0.05. Bivariate correlation between the difference of intrahepatic fat content (IFC) levels and VO2 max were also analyzed with Pearson correlation.  3. Results  3.1. Anthropometric, Biochemical, and Hematological Parameters  The anthropometric and biochemical characteristics of participants with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) categorized by tertiles after 6 months of change in intrahepatic fat content (IFC) are shown in Table 1.",7da2731b-bffe-4a45-bded-a7f804befb60
11,methods11," Significant differences were evidenced in weight, body mass index (BMI), triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase (aminotransferase (ALT)), and gamma glutamyl transferase (gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT)) when comparing the evolution after 6 months of intervention. The patients in tertiles 2 and 3 presented greater decreases with respect to tertile 1 in weight (p = 0.017 and p < 0.001, respectively), body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.025 and p = 0.024, respectively), and triglycerides (p = 0.048 and p = 0.005, respectively), whereas patients in tertile 3 presented better aminotransferase (ALT) evolution with respect to tertile 1 (p = 0.014). No differences were observed in systolic and diastolic blood pressure or in the rest of the biochemical parameters.  Table 2 summarizes information on hematological parameters at baseline and 6 months follow-up according to tertiles of 6 months change in intrahepatic fat content (IFC).",a56f5e1e-b5f6-45a7-a821-2bcd703e94a0
12,methods12," When changes between tertiles were compared, significant differences were reported in platelets levels, whereas no differences were described in the rest of the hematological variables of the participants.  intrahepatic fat content (IFC) levels at baseline and after 6 months of intervention were shown in Figure 1. The improvement in intrahepatic fat content (IFC) was significantly higher in tertile 3 with respect to tertiles 2 and 1 (p < 0.001). The adherence to the Mediterranean diet (ADM) was increased in the three group after 6 months when compared with the beginning of the intervention, and this improvement was significantly higher in the tertile 3 with respect to tertile 1 (p = 0.039) (Figure 2). The results of VO2 max in Chester step test (CST) are represented in Figure 3. The obtained data reported a significant improvement in tertile 3 with respect to tertile 1 (p = 0.011).",93e5cced-3b2f-413d-a159-2b13a036f6bc
13,methods13," A direct correlation between the difference of intrahepatic fat content (IFC) levels and VO2 max was found (r = 0.386, p < 0.01), whereas an inverse correlation was observed between intrahepatic fat content (IFC) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (ADM) (r = −0.332, p < 0.05).  3.2. Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory Biomarkers  Table 3 shows the changes in the enzymatic activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the protein levels of myeloperoxidase (Myeloperoxidase (MPO)), xanthine oxidase (xanthine oxidase (XOD)), resolvin D1, irisin, and cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) and the biomarkers of plasma damage malondialdehyde (Malondialdehyde (MDA)) and protein carbonyl derivates. The differences in catalase (CAT) activity after 6 months of intervention were significantly higher in tertile 3 with respect to tertile 1 (p = 0.002), whereas no significant changes were observed in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity.",e6b4a228-2fae-4e7a-b6ad-20c599767677
14,methods14," Irisin and CK-18 levels reported differences in tertile 3 with respect to tertile 1, with higher reductions between baseline and 6 months (p = 0.047 for irisin and p = 0.042 for CK-18). No differences were found in resolvin D1, Myeloperoxidase (MPO), xanthine oxidase (XOD), IL-6, TNFα, and Malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls between groups.  4. Discussion  The main findings of the current study are that a reduction in intrahepatic fat content (IFC) regardless of the type of intervention followed is related to better oxidative and inflammatory state and with an improvement in aerobic capacity. The baseline situation of these patients at the beginning of the study in addition to Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed biochemical parameters out of the described reference values [12].",0a6ab799-58ad-47b8-a51b-a8c00be81022
15,methods15," The reduction of weight and body mass index (BMI) in tertile 3 subjects when compared with tertile 1 is associated with the improvement in intrahepatic fat content (IFC). Previous studies suggested that body mass index (BMI) or weight reduction is not essential for decreasing hepatic fat contents or to restore normal liver function [42]; however, current international guidelines stated that the primary goal of nutrition therapy in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is to reduce energy intake by 500–100 kcal per day to achieve a 7–10% reduction in body weight [30,43,44]. It has been reported that an optimal nutritional therapy for patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) could be an initial very-low-calorie diet period of several weeks, characterized by high protein, high-soluble fiber, and low-carbohydrate formula, followed by a structured program of food reintroduction implementing Mediterranean dietary patterns [45].",2779d0e6-d64d-43e6-8a0a-4c169a2292cd
16,methods16,"  The intervention groups in the present study were designed to improve the intrahepatic fat content (IFC) in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. For this reason, three different interventions for the management of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were selected following international guidelines, which recommend the combination of dietary modifications and physical activity to lose weight [46,47]. At 6 months of intervention, a similar improvement was observed in the three groups, with no statistical differences between them [47]. These results led us to analyze the differences in stress and inflammation markers according to the degree of improvement in the intrahepatic fat content (IFC) regardless of the intervention followed by the patients. However, when grouping the participants according to the degree of improvement in intrahepatic fat content (IFC), it was observed that the groups are different at baseline.",94fe0f34-7495-4896-836a-aef95e81d00b
17,methods17," In fact, the group that presented the highest intrahepatic fat content (IFC) at the beginning of the study is the one that improved the most after 6 months of intervention. These data are consistent with studies that report greater weight loss in patients undergoing nutritional intervention as their body mass index (BMI) increases due to the greater ease of losing fat in subjects with a higher initial fat content than in those closer to normal weight [48,49]. In addition, when analyzing the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (ADM), a greater increase was observed between the start of the intervention and after 6 months in parallel to the greater decrease in intrahepatic fat content (IFC). The Mediterranean diet is characterized by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, so the improvement in diet quality may contribute to the improvement observed in the patients included in tertile 3 [50].",a877fb24-e520-4791-9fac-30e733b87633
18,methods18,"  Participants with better improvement in intrahepatic fat content (IFC) showed fewer levels of triglycerides, aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) after 6 months of intervention with respect to basal levels. One of the hallmarks of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the appearance of insulin resistance that leads to an increase in plasma glucose concentrations and an excessive production of triglyceride rich VLDL, inducing hypertriglyceridemia [51,52]. aminotransferase (ALT) is a liver enzyme commonly used as specific marker of liver inflammation and hepatocellular damage and widely used as marker of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) presence in addition to presenting a good correlation with liver fat contents [53,54].",101fa230-55c2-4bf6-a14b-c0af4e8b2a21
19,methods19," However, it should be considered that up to 25% of patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) had normal aminotransferase (ALT) values; therefore, high aminotransferase (ALT) serum levels might underestimate the prevalence of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [55]. The current findings are in accordance with previous results, which showed high levels of triglycerides, aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients with intrahepatic fat content (IFC) ≥ 2 in comparison to patients with intrahepatic fat content (IFC) of 0 and 1 [12]. This improvement was also observed in a dietary intervention study based on the Mediterranean diet, in which the patients reduced their weight by 7% along with a significant improvement in body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, AST, aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and TG after the intervention period [55].",486f47d0-20ff-4159-a291-f879db79a713
20,methods20,"  One of the relevant results of the current study is the direct relationship between the improvement in aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and the improvement in intrahepatic fat content (IFC), indicating the importance of physical activity in the reversal of fat accumulation in the liver. It has been evidenced that the Chester step test (CST) is a valid, easy, and inexpensive solution for assessing the VO2 max in individuals with hypertension [56]. Increasing physical activity (aerobic physical activity and resistance training) and avoiding a sedentary lifestyle has been shown to exert a beneficial impact on Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by improving liver injury, liver fat, and the histologic features of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [57]. In this sense, it has been shown that a lifestyle intervention combining diet and physical activity promotion improved functional fitness in patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [58].",caaf7cc3-99ab-41e6-9c7b-d00317170470
21,methods21," However, it has been shown that although patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are aware of the need for physical activity, most described problems for its regular practice, such as lack of resources and education, physical discomfort during exercise, or time constraints [59]. All make it necessary to motivate and work hard with patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) so that they perform physical exercise and do not abandon it.  Moreover, current participants also showed a reduction of the activities of enzymatic antioxidants catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) after 6 months of intervention in tertile 3 subjects. Previous data suggested that the excessive reactive species (ROS) production and inflammation are key actors in the pathogenesis of NALFD and directly related to hepatic cell death and apoptosis [28].",ce71c1f5-5a48-4238-9c02-91e2ef996436
22,methods22," These findings would indicate a reduction in the degree of oxidative stress and points out the importance of the improvement of intrahepatic fat content (IFC) as a healthy life contributing for a better oxidative stress status. It has been well-established that the activities of enzymatic antioxidants were high in early and advanced Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) subjects compared to controls because of a more pro-oxidant state in these patients [12,60]. The alterations in lipid metabolism led to the accumulation of lipids in the liver, which results in an overproduction of reactive species (ROS) within the mitochondria electron transport chain. Moreover, metabolic liver diseases such as Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are associated with increased reactive species (ROS) production during fatty acid β-oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and NADPH oxidase alterations [61].",e5080215-dee5-4d78-a8f5-5645f214f4c2
23,methods23," The reduction in the activity of antioxidant enzymes is not related to changes in oxidative damage markers, which could indicate that the activation of antioxidant defenses in these patients allows keeping oxidative damage under control.  In addition, the current findings did not show significant differences in the Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) levels as biomarkers of pro-oxidative states. In the case of Myeloperoxidase (MPO), as this enzyme is released mainly by neutrophils, this lack of changes could be related to the fact that the number of these cells did not change after 6 months of intervention [62]. Regarding xanthine oxidase (XOD), there is a trend to decrease, but this change is not significant; therefore, it would be necessary to achieve an additional improvement in hepatic steatosis with a longer intervention time.  Furthermore, irisin levels were significantly reduced in tertile 3 after 6 months with respect to tertile 1.",756ce17e-bd6c-420e-8713-07cd9ff63b23
24,methods24," Irisin is a myokine/adipokine induced by exercise in humans, which is proposed to produce “browning” of white adipose tissue, thus increasing thermogenesis and energy expenditure [63]. Irisin is a promising regulator of glucose metabolism, which is involved in glucose homeostasis in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, contributing to normoglycemia [64]. Previous report showed that the subjects with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) had higher irisin levels than healthy ones [65], and these high levels have been suggested to act as a compensatory mechanism aimed at improving energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity [66]. Thus, the reduction of its levels in the group with more improvement could be indicative of a metabolic normalization of these patients.  The current study revealed that patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), who improved the intrahepatic fat content (IFC) levels the most, also showed an improvement in CK18 levels.",631efd34-1ef4-45fd-a390-f4804643f296
25,methods25," CK18 is a marker for apoptosis and inflammation, which found to be increased in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients [67]. Previous studies revealed that CK18 increased with liver steatosis, and it has been described as an adequate and non-invasive marker, which could allow for the identifications of patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [12,68,69]. Moreover, studies have shown a decrease in serum CK18 levels and weight loss in patients with liver fibrosis after 6-month dietary intervention; consequently, this points out the existence of a positive association between changes in CK18 levels and weight loss [70]. However, other more general markers related to inflammation, such as TNFα, IL-6, or resolvin D1, did not show changes in their values.",25e76618-5896-4170-8dbe-1aea229e7255
26,methods26," This could be due to the fact that although after 6 months of intervention, there was a reduction in body mass index (BMI), patients continue to be obese; thus, these more general markers would not be sensitive enough and would require further improvement.  A limitation of the study could derive from the differences in the baseline intrahepatic fat content (IFC) between the groups, which could make it difficult to interpret the results. However, the objective of the study was to analyze the changes associated with the intrahepatic fat content (IFC) after a 6-month period to evidence the benefits of liver fat loss rather than comparing the initial values.  5. Conclusions  The present data evidenced that the reduction of intrahepatic fat content (IFC) is associated with an improvement in oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory status and a better cardiorespiratory fitness in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients.",949f99a7-67ad-4440-b291-4ec0ebf2fbe4
27,methods27," Plasma oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers were mainly reduced in the patients in the tertile that showed a greater reduction in intrahepatic fat levels after 6 months of lifestyle intervention. The relationship between aerobic capacity improvement, the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (ADM), and intrahepatic fat content (IFC) reduction highlights the importance of the quality of diet and regular physical activity in the prevention/reversal of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In conclusion, the beneficial effects of lifestyle changes on Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development could be applied to prevent incident Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (as cardiovascular diseases) and reduce the future public health burden. However, evidence regarding the effects of this approach on non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with advanced fibrosis, until now, is insufficient and must be evaluated and verified in future studies.
