0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design The original Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) is registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/, Identifier: NCT02356952 [30].  MEDIDIET was a parallel-arm Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT). Subjects with MetS were selected from the MICOL cohort study conducted at the National Institute of Gastroenterology “Saverio de Bellis” Research Hospital [31,32]. MICOL is an ongoing population study, which was started in 1985, including subjects randomly sampled (aged 30–89 years) from the electoral rolls of Castellana Grotte, a town in southern Italy (Apulia region). The cohort was followed up in 1992–1993 and in 2005–2006. In total, 2472 men and women were enrolled. In the second follow-up, the cohort was fed with 1273 randomly sampled young participants (30–49 years old) to compensate for aging of the cohort.  2.2.",3cd5c74e-83cd-4b30-9212-6c029742e314
1,methods1," Participants Selection Between December 2007 and April 2008, MICOL subjects who had been screened in 2005–2006 and had MetS (1042 subjects) were invited to undergo further examination: 556 subjects responded and 163 of 387 subjects (100 males, 63 females) were still affected by MetS. We included subjects treated with statins, anti-hypertensives, and oral antidiabetics, but excluded subjects in insulin treatment. Patients were requested not to change their exercise habits after enrollment in the study.  The trial was conducted in collaboration with General Practitioners, approved by the Ethics Committee of our Institution (D.Legs 502/92, Conv. N.54-2 marzo 2006) in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, and all participants provided written informed consent.  2.3.",42068cf5-60b1-44ed-a198-27dd6a319782
2,methods2," Randomization Participants were randomly assigned by simple randomization procedures (computerized random numbers sequence) to one of three diets or the Control group (C); a one-to-one ratio was used to allocate the subjects.  Blinding was maintained, firstly assuring the staff and participants that each diet was based on healthy principles. Participants were followed for the duration of the trial and the dietitian was assigned on a daily random basis. Moreover, only one intervention group was called in each day to reduce to a minimum the information exchange among participants. Staff members who assessed the outcomes were unaware of the diet assigned. Only one of two radiologists performed outcome measurements each day and this order was also randomly assigned. In the follow-up performed at the third and sixth months, the radiologists were unaware of the previous measurements.  2.4. Baseline Examination Initial screening included a complete medical history and physical examination.",1af155d3-918a-462d-963e-ed228ebd4819
3,methods3," Participants were asked to complete a structured questionnaire administered by a trained interviewer. Blood pressure at rest was measured by a trained nurse, using a sphygmomanometer with the appropriate cuff. Blood samples were drawn in the morning after overnight fasting and biochemical measurements were performed using standardized methods in the central laboratory of our institution. The serum was separated into two different aliquots. One aliquot was immediately stored at −80 °C. Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference) were taken by three dietitians. Weight measurements were taken using SECA mechanical scales (Model 700; SECA, Hamburg, Germany), while height was measured using a wall-mounted altimeter (Model 206; 220 cm; SECA, Hamburg, Germany). Dietitians also administered a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire [33] and carried out Bio-Impedentiometric Analysis (Bio Impedentiometric Analysis (BIA)) (Akern SRL, Pontassieve FI, Italy).",0cb68401-7115-44ae-b78c-61d1da22c3dd
4,methods4," Visceral Adiposity Thickness (Visceral Adiposity Thickness (VAT)) was measured with Ultrasound scans using a strict protocol. It was defined as the distance between the anterior wall of the aorta and the internal face of the rectus abdominis muscle perpendicular to the aorta [34].  2.5. Dietary Intervention The recommended diets were provided in brochure format, with graphical explanations organized according to a traffic light system: with a list of foods that can be consumed frequently (green foods), sometimes (yellow foods), and never (red foods). The brochure also contained a dietary record, where participants indicated daily the code of each food consumed at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and during snack time. There were no calorie restrictions. Diets composition is shown in Appendix A.  We studied the effects of the following diets: Mediterranean diet (MD), built using the Trichopoulou A. et al. study [35]; Low Glycemic Index diet (Low Glycemic Index diet (LGID)) based on the Elia A.",055de94f-b8cf-4ac3-8d59-2f7490396ea1
5,methods5," study [36], and Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD)), created by integrating the Trichopolou A. et al. [35] and Elia A. studies [36] and adapting them to our population.  Individuals recorded what they ate on a daily diet diary. The main objectives pursued in the creation of the diets and the administration and monitoring tools were: (1) to let subjects choose their foods and (2) to help them monitor what they ate. The characteristics of the three diets and their main nutritional composition are described in Appendix A and Appendix B. Mean intake of Energy, Alcohol, and Macronutrients were calculated using Metadieta® software, version 3.7. Patients were asked not to change their physical activity after enrollment in the study.  Control group participants were only given general nutritional counseling and were advised to maintain their lifestyle. The control group was followed up with the same methodology.  2.6.",13741969-f016-49d8-8e9f-8983b0ea84e6
6,methods6," Outcomes In the protocol, primary outcome measures were MetS, MetS score, and its components. Secondary outcomes were anthropometric measurements and biochemical markers and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)) score (measured by Liver Ultrasound (Liver Ultrasound (LUS))).  The quantitative serum levels of Total Cholesterol (TC), Triglycerides (Triglycerides (TGL)), Glucose (G), HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C), and Insulin (Insulin (INS)) were evaluated using the UniCelDxC and DxI 660i Integrated System (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). The timed endpoint method was used for chemicals and the chemiluminescent method for insulin. LDL-C was assessed using Friedewald’s formula [37].  Insulin resistance and beta-cell function were estimated by the Homeostasis Model Assessment (Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA)) Index = (glucose × insulin)/22.5 [38].",529106f0-5408-4e59-9ede-7763d6c214f5
7,methods7,"  In accordance with the reference values routinely adopted in our laboratory, we considered out-of-range values as: total cholesterol > 5.18 mmol/L, triglycerides > 1.86mmol/L, glucose > 6.94 mmol/L, HDL-C < 1.04 mmol/L, insulin > 29 μIU/mL, LDL-C > 3.88 mmol/L, and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) > 2.5.  REM-C was calculated as [total cholesterol−LDL-C−HDL-C] and we considered a value >30 mg/dL as altered, in accordance with the literature for fasting REM-C [39].  2.7. Implementation Subjects were followed up monthly for dietary counseling, to check diaries, and to control anthropometric parameters. After 12 and 24 weeks from the beginning of the study, the subjects again underwent fasting blood sampling and Bio Impedentiometric Analysis (BIA).  2.8. Statistical Analysis The primary analysis was intention-to-treat. Data were extensively described by means of Tables by using Mean (±SD) and frequency (%) as descriptive measures for continuous and categorical variables, respectively.",aeef7a9e-fd88-4787-b7ca-45d3c9def395
8,methods8,"  The Mediterranean Adequacy Index (Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI)) [40,41] was calculated to assess the compliance with the prescribed diet. Random week and week-end days were chosen from the second and fourth month of intervention. The Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) was estimated according to gender and month to clearly describe compliance. Compliance was defined as positive if the subject’s ratio of percentage of calories derived from Low Glycemic Index diet (LGID) or MD or Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) foods, divided by percentage of calories from foods not in the Low Glycemic Index diet (LGID), MD or Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD), was equal to or above the median value for the whole population under study. A median value of 7.5 with an inter-quantile range (inter quantile range (IQR)) of 5.4 was expected, as established by the reference Italian Mediterranean Diet [40].",c78f629d-c0c6-4646-8b15-3fe7ece833f6
9,methods9," An Analysis of Variance for repeated measures was performed to analyze the differences among group means (Diet by Time). This statistical technique was chosen because it is computationally elegant and relatively robust against violations of its assumptions, provides strong (multiple sample comparison) statistical analysis, and it has been adapted to the analysis of a variety of experimental designs. As REM-C was not normally distributed, a natural logarithmic transformation was applied. A post estimation procedure was then applied to contrast the estimated means by taking a reference category, in this case Control group at baseline. Margins statistics were calculated from predictions of a previously fit Analysis of Variance model and displayed graphically.  Statistical analysis was performed using Stata statistical software (version 16.1), StataCorp, 4905 Lakeway Drive, College Station, TX, USA (the Stata code is available upon request from the email: arosella@irccsdebellis.it).  3.",35a9e038-e1b8-4224-b9b8-b35db1590640
10,methods10," Results Sample Description Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1. At Baseline, there was no significant difference for any of the variables considered among C and the intervention groups (Low Glycemic Index diet (LGID), MD, and Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD)). There were 61, 62, 57, and 57 subjects in the C, Low Glycemic Index diet (LGID), MD, and Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) groups, respectively. About 40% were females and the mean age was 57.6 (11.8) (men 56.8 (12.0), women 58.8 (11.3)). Mean age was 54.9 (13.9) for controls, 57.5 (10.7) for Low Glycemic Index diet (LGID), 59.4 (10.4) for MD, and 58.3 (9.8) for Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD). Baseline REM-C levels were slightly different among groups, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Systolic Blood Pressure (Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)) were higher than the normal range.",8bfdb186-0c7e-4915-97ab-65536156ee86
11,methods11," As expected, all subjects were obese with a BMI of about 33.0 for most groups and 34.93 for LIGMD. Biochemical markers other than REM-C were equally distributed among the control and intervention groups.  Overall, Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) prevalence in the sample was 82.28% and it was more prevalent in men (88.89%) than in women (72.04%). Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity grade was Absent (17.72%), Mild (18.57%), Moderate (41.77%), and Severe (21.94%). Men had more severe grades of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).  Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity by Intervention group and Time. At baseline, in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) absent subjects, REM-C in the control group was lower than in subjects who underwent dietary intervention, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.",c6e8f56b-27a8-429e-92a7-08e3c9ca4d13
12,methods12," In all other categories of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), REM-C were equally distributed.  Overall, adherence to the prescribed diet was 72.82%. The adherence was higher in women (79.98%) than in men (68.85%). Figure 1 shows the change over time of REM-C level by degree of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity and type of intervention, both for the whole sample and for the adherent subjects. In the whole sample, there was a decreasing trend in REM-C levels in Absent or Mild Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects for MD and Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) diets. The same trend was observed in subjects with moderate or severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) randomized to the MD diet. Instead, in adherent subjects, a decreasing trend was observed with the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) diet for moderate or severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).",95dcd770-4ec3-43b9-aa69-b97e872a824f
13,methods13,"  Results from Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance for Diet and Time are shown in Table 3. In the whole sample, there were statistically significant principal effects for MD (−23.76, 95%CI −43.97; −3.56) and Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) (−36.40, 95%CI −56.61; −16.20). Principal effects of Time were of small size and were not statistically significant. Statistically significant principal effects of Diets (increasing levels of REM-C) and Time were observed in adherent subjects. It is worth noting that among Adherent subjects, the referent value is the Low Glycemic Index diet (LGID).  As regards the test of linear hypothesis, contrast of Time within each level of Diet evidenced a statistically significant effect for any contrast of Time (Three and Six months vs. Baseline) and Diet, except for Control Diet. These contrasts behaved in a similar way for both the whole sample and adherent subjects. These results are graphically displayed in Figure 2.",d20df97f-8ae1-4789-b569-de167bfb5fd3
14,methods14,"  Results from Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance for Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Severity and Time are shown in Table 4. In the whole sample, there were no statistically significant principal effects for Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity, but there were statistically significant effects for Time. There was a statistically significant principal effect of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity, but not a principal effect of Time.  As regards the test of linear hypothesis, contrast of Time within each level of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity evidenced a statistically significant effect for Time (three and six months) when Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) was Absent and for Moderate Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) at three months when the whole sample was considered. For Adherent Subjects, the contrast was statistically significant, but in an opposite way.",0944c368-016d-468b-8db3-376613e1f50f
15,methods15," For Moderate Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), REM-C levels decreased at three and six months. Instead, in Severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), there was a statistically significant increase in REM-C level at 3 months with a subsequent non statistically significant decrease at 6 months. Figure 3 displays the results for this analysis and it is possible to observe a positive association between increasing levels of REM-C and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity.  4. Discussion In this research, all diets had a direct effect in lowering the levels of REM-C after 3 and 6 months of intervention in subjects with MetS. In adherent subjects, this effect was stronger mostly among Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) as compared to the control group.",03941c70-c66f-47f3-a1b9-c2066629c7ff
16,methods16,"  Besides, REM-C levels were higher in subjects with moderate or severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) than in mild or absent ones, suggesting an association between liver metabolic function and REM-C: for the duration of the intervention, the less severe the degree of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), the lower the level of REM-C. Furthermore, while in the whole sample, there was a statistically significant decreasing trend among absent Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and moderate Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects. In the adherent group, the behavior was different: there was a statistically significant decreasing trend among moderate Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects and a statistically significant increase at 3 months with a subsequent non significative decrease in the severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects. These contrasting findings could be attributed to the role of diet in liver metabolism [43].",cbdff303-33ce-40fd-a49d-c7698580e16e
17,methods17," It is possible to speculate that some subjects had a higher intake of saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)), although adherent to the diet. As shown in Appendix B (Table A1), the mean intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA)s in the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) reached 15% of total Kcal, while international guidelines recommend only 10% [44]. While greatly reducing the consumption of red and processed meat, the intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA)s and dietary cholesterol may have increased from the consumption of eggs, dairy products, and some fatty fish, such as mackerel. Although these products are typical of the Mediterranean diet, consumed in greater quantities, they may have worsened the Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity. There is evidence that saturated fatty acids (SFA)s reduce peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin, while monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) can offset this effect [45,46].",8291f42f-e394-4ad1-9221-3cd583abdafe
18,methods18,"  A relationship between dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular mortality is widely documented [47,48,49]. In particular, among the diet-related factors, saturated fatty acids (SFA)s have the greatest impact on LDL-C. An increase by 0.8–1.6 mg/dL of LDL-C is estimated for each 1% increase in saturated fatty acids (SFA)s intake [50]. Partially hydrogenated fatty acids are the main source of fats in foods of industrial origin, ranging from 2% to 5% of daily food intake in western countries. Their effect on LDL-C values is similar to that of saturated fatty acids (SFA)s [51]. Excess alcohol consumption is associated with increased adipocyte lipolysis and flow of Free Fatty Acids (FFAs) to the liver, resulting in increased Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDL) production [52].",aa28794d-2888-45fb-baa6-f83c7e095760
19,methods19," The western diet, characterized by an overconsumption of fructose, red meat, alcohol, soft drinks, and saturated fatty acids (SFA)s, in addition to a reduced intake of dietary fiber and omega-3 rich foods, displays an unfavorable relationship with the occurrence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). This association may be explained by different mechanisms and attributed to each of the components that characterize this dietary pattern.  Our results show that changes in lifestyle and, in particular, eating habits are of great importance for the prevention and clinical management of MetS and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [43].  The Mediterranean way of eating is recommended for the treatment of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) thanks to its potential to improve metabolic alterations such as insulin resistance and lipid profile, even without any accompanying weight loss [26].",5783edde-4c59-440c-a5c2-7f101f0745a5
20,methods20," The Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) owes its positive effects to the high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) from extra virgin olive oil, polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) from fish and nuts, fruit fibers, legumes and vegetables, as well as the reduced intake saturated fatty acids (SFA) and hydrogenated fatty acids. A greater intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) omega-3 and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)s are considered as beneficial since they limit inflammation and endothelial dysfunction and improve dyslipidemia [53,54]. In addition, replacing packaged and processed food with fresh food leads to a reduction in salt intake. Salt intake has also been suggested to be associated with an increased risk for Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [25].",e8732e42-dda3-485c-9dcb-21300b5c0b7d
21,methods21,"  Furthermore, the greater intake of fiber and whole grains in Low Glycemic Index diet (LGID) and Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) may have influenced the glycemic index control and, as a consequence, an improvement in the IR condition in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) rather than in the MD diet. Moreover, the use of whole grains in Low Glycemic Index diet (LGID) and Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) was fundamental in inducing further benefits on the cardiometabolic risk profile as they contain phenolic compounds, which increase antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [55,56]. Whole grains have the potential to beneficially influence the gut microbiota composition [57], which can be relevant due to the importance of the gut-liver axis in the onset and progression of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [58].",38dcaf08-7574-426e-9eb4-8a3ce6fe7133
22,methods22,"  Subjects with severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) had the most impaired metabolic profile and showed significantly higher levels of REM-C at baseline. Our results are consistent with recent literature. In a prospective observational study, Pastori et al. (2018) [21] found that Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) was independently associated with higher serum fasting REM-C. In the same work, high REM-C levels were predictive of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). In fact, it is known that subjects with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) have prolonged metabolic disorders involving the glycemic and lipid balance. Dyslipidemia occurs with increased triglycerides, elevated atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL-C and Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDL)-C), and reduced HDL-C levels. A glycemic imbalance develops, instead, with the condition of greater resistance to insulin.",e6b4069d-504a-41da-b24b-20d0f34a95b1
23,methods23," In this context, it was recently shown that patients with hepatic IR exhibited a higher postprandial triglyceride response than patients with muscle IR or without IR [59]. In the insulin resistant state, an increased lipolysis of adipocytes causes an increased flow of FFAs in the liver, which feeds APO-B lipidation, leading to an increase in Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDL) production and de novo liver lipogenesis [60], which is ultimately shown by an increase in remnant cholesterol levels. As suggested by other studies, REM-C is a promising tool for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk assessment since REM-C shares with LDL-C has the potential to enter and be trapped in the arterial wall, triggering plaque formation and progression [61,62].  Some methodological issues need to be considered. The strength of this study is the setting from which the population came from.",422bdf61-0793-467e-9fa4-e4dd6056ef19
24,methods24," One limitation of our work stems from the fact that calculated REM-C may not be as accurate as direct measurement, but it is difficult to assess all remnants components as it is more expensive and time consuming [63]. Therefore, calculated REM-C is an alternative approach to the direct measurement of REM-C, which has already been used in the studies of large Danish cohorts [10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. The fact that the sample size was not established based on the levels of REM-C can be criticized, but this is a secondary analysis and regardless, the sample came from the general population, so it is reasonable to think that it represents the true distribution of this marker.  5. Conclusions In conclusion, fasting REM-C level is independently associated with the grade of severity of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and the improvement of the metabolic state of the liver and IR induced by the diet reduces the REM-C level.",901d92d5-a086-4d77-be47-bfec9ce389be
25,methods25," The Mediterranean dietary pattern may be a useful strategy for reducing the degree of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in patients with MetS and high-risk cardiovascular diseases (CVD) to decrease the residual risk associated with REM-C. The Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) diet has proven to be more effective than other diets in reducing REM-C in the total sample. However, it is essential to control the saturated fatty acids (SFA) intake, especially in subjects with moderate and severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).
