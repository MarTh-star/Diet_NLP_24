0,methods0," 2.1. Survey Development  The present online research was developed within the trial DIMENU (Dieta Mediterranea e Nuoto-Mediterranean Diet and Swimming) funded by the EU Regional Operational Program Calabria, Italy (POR Calabria FESR-FSE 2014–2020) (prot.#52243/2017) [12], in which a group of adolescents, aged 15 to 17 years, was recruited from students of the public high school “Istituto Istruzione Superiore”-Castrolibero (CS) and several swim, soccer, and squash teams located in Calabria Region, Italy before the COVID-19 pandemic period. This pilot study was carried out from March to May 2020 in 91 adolescents (42 females and 49 males) who received an invitation by e-mail explaining the purpose of the investigation and inviting recipients to click on the hypertext link to invoke the web browser, presenting the questionnaire. In this survey, 100% of the replies were received.",49cbe909-cb93-4717-bf56-c13fffcc578f
1,methods1," This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics committee of the University of Calabria, Italy (#5727/2018). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants’ parents.  2.2. Questionnaire  The questionnaire (DIMENU—Lifestyle Survey, DIMENU-LS) (Table A1 in Appendix A), including 30 questions, was designed to assess changes in both lifestyle and eating habit behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak. The online questionnaire was divided into three different parts: (1) KIDMED test, used to assess the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) [14], that was updated according to the new MD pyramid by the International Foundation of Mediterranean diet (IFMed) [15]. The MD adherence score, from 0 to 12, was based on a 16-point test.",ecf023a1-21de-4bdf-80f3-7c920f9bcfd0
2,methods2," Questions denoting a positive aspect with respect to the MD were assigned a value of +1 (consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, whole cereals or grain, nuts, oil, dairy products, and yogurt) and those with a negative connotation −1 (skipping breakfast, consumption of baked goods, sweets, and consumption of delivery junk foods). Level of adherence to MD was indicated as follows: high adherence to MD (≥8 points), medium adherence to MD (4–7 points), low adherence to MD (≤3 points). (2) Institute of Health (ISS) Score designed following recommendations from “Physical activity guidelines for children and young people” promoted by EpiCentro website belonging to the National Institute of Health (Institute of Health (ISS)) [16] to counter the increase of sedentary lifestyles and promoting an active lifestyle at home during the period of social isolation. It was used to assess active/sedentary lifestyle of the participants during the COVID-19 lockdown.",099fb700-3c9d-4acc-8f59-8cf65eb12ec8
3,methods3," The Institute of Health (ISS) score was based on a 7-point test, where from 0 to 3 points indicated a low score and from 4 to 7 points indicated a high score. (3) General questions on the actual perception of changes in lifestyle and eating habits at home. Once completed, each questionnaire was transmitted to the Google platform and the final database was downloaded as a Microsoft Excel sheet.  2.3. Statistical Analysis  Data were analyzed by SigmaPlot for Windows Version 12.0 (Systat, San Jose, CA, USA) and reported as mean, standard deviation (SD) and range. Data normality was verified by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (with Lilliefors’ correction). The statistical differences between quantitative variables were evaluated by Student’s t-test. Qualitative variables were described as frequencies (%) and the statistical differences were evaluated by chi-squared test.",fb68ef8c-2d09-44a9-8a57-d652921e7852
4,methods4," The radar charts were built to display the percentage of participants currently adherent to each dietary/lifestyle recommendation respect to the ideal situation (100% compliance). Relationship between variables was evaluated by multivariate linear regression and linear regression analyses. The association between variables is graphically represented through a straight line calculated using the regression coefficient. Pearson’s correlation test was used to assess statistical significance. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.  3. Results  3.1. Description of Study Sample  A total of 91 adolescents (aged 15–17 years, 42 females and 49 males), enrolled into the DIMENU study [12], completed the online questionnaire on physical activity behaviors, eating habits changes, eating frequency and adherence to the MD during the lockdown period. A detailed breakdown of the characteristics of the total sample population, divided into girls and boys, is given in Table 1.",2757581b-a678-4969-ac46-76010378eef3
5,methods5,"  Notably, a substantial proportion of participants currently considered their lifestyle active (63%) with the highest Institute of Health (ISS) score in most of the total sample, which was independent of gender (high score: total sample: 78%, females: 74%, males: 82%). With regards to eating habits during the COVID-19 lockdown, most of the population declared no changes (total sample: 63%, females: 59%, males: 65%), while the percentages of total adolescents who consumed 4 and 5 meals/day were 39% and 26%, respectively. The KIDMED questionnaire, assessing the compliance to the MD recommendations, revealed an average adherence score in total adolescents, again without gender differences, with approximately half of the total population declaring medium adherence to the MD (medium adherence: total sample: 49%, female 48%, male 51%).  3.2.",43c262a8-23cd-4439-8870-5f7d26c3991d
6,methods6," Multiple Regression Analysis with KIDMED or Lifestyle and Institute of Health (ISS), Age, and Sex  Next, in multiple linear regression we analyzed the KIDMED score as well as lifestyle habits in relation to Institute of Health (ISS) score using age and sex as independent variables in the total sample. Interestingly, we observed that the KIDMED score can be predicted from a linear combination of the Institute of Health (ISS) score (β = 0.375, p < 0.001), age (β = 0.140 p = 0.170), and sex (β = 0.076 p = 0.454) (Table 2). Similarly, lifestyle can be predicted from a linear combination of the Institute of Health (ISS) score (β = 0.432, p < 0.001), age (β = −0.087 p = 0.373), and sex (β = 0.0463 p = 0.642) (Table 2). These data suggest a direct relationship between Institute of Health (ISS) and both KIDMED and lifestyle, independent of age and sex.  3.3.",ef9b7b68-3aac-4cf9-9ec9-0fb869411081
7,methods7," Dietary and Physical Activity Behaviors in Sedentary and Active Adolescents during the Lockdown Period  Based on the self-reported PA behaviors during COVID-19-related restrictions, we divided our population in active and sedentary and compared the percentages of eating habit change, frequency of meals a day, and KIDMED and Institute of Health (ISS) scores between the two groups of adolescents (Table 3).  As expected, Institute of Health (ISS) score was significantly higher in active than sedentary adolescents (p = 0.0001). Interestingly, in active adolescents a significant higher KIDMED score (p = 0.0028) along with a strong increase in the percentage of optimal adherents (p = 0.01) and a reduction in poor adherents (p = 0.05) to the MD were observed.",7fe96d96-3076-4e7a-948a-3e96a1cca4c7
8,methods8," Moreover, using the results of the KIDMED test, a comparison of the compliance rates for each food was calculated between the two groups and depicted in radar charts which clearly illustrate the gap between the current state (percentage of participants currently adhering to each dietary recommendation) and the ideal situation (100% compliance) (Figure 1).  There were significant differences between active and sedentary adolescents in the food rates for most of the dietary recommendations. Indeed, active adolescents showed a greater intake of a fruit/day, a second fruit/day, more vegetables/day, nuts ≥ 2 times/week, and low-fat dairy products for breakfast than sedentary. In the same group of adolescents, the percentages of subjects having breakfast and not consuming sweets or candy every day were significantly higher compared to those of other groups (Figure 1).",fe792f19-b63d-4691-b765-53cb19787f00
9,methods9," More interestingly, while we found that Institute of Health (ISS) and KIDMED scores failed to be associated in sedentary adolescents, they were positively correlated in active adolescents (r = 0.311, p = 0.0185) (Figure 2).  3.4. Self-Perceived Physical Activity and the Relation to Life Satisfaction in Sedentary and Active Adolescents during the COVID-19 Lockdown  We also evaluated the differences in the items of Institute of Health (ISS) questionnaire in the two PA groups. As shown in Table 4, a strong increase in active compared to sedentary participants was evident in performing PA at least 1 h a day at home (89% vs. 41%, p = 0.00001) and at least 1 h 3 times a week (93% vs. 59%, p = 0.00007), as well as resting at least 6–8 h in the night (95% vs. 79%, p = 0.02) and helping in doing some housework (96% vs. 85%, p = 0.05).",358e8d9d-b259-480c-9899-813515428bb7
10,methods10,"  Analyzing the PA behaviors into the two groups of active and sedentary adolescents, we asked: “Did you practice physical activity regularly before the COVID-19 emergency or did you gradually start exercising at home?” Table 5 displays results pertaining to reported changes in the PA showing that active adolescents declared to continue physical activity at home in a percentage significantly higher with respect to sedentary (75% vs. 35%, p = 0.0001). Similarly, sedentary adolescents declared to not practice exercise at home in a greater percentage than in active group (41% vs. 2%, p = 0.00001).  Finally, significant differences between sedentary and active adolescents with respect of their life satisfaction level related to PA were found (Table 6). Indeed, only a minority of active participants considered it boring to practice PA at home compared to sedentary (16% vs. 44%, p = 0.003) and most of them declared to feel good (active: 58% vs. sedentary: 32%, p = 0.01).  4.",acdfa11d-ea6a-475b-8ebd-8cee7bf7fb2e
11,methods11," Discussion  In the present web survey, we investigated the self-perceived lifestyle, including PA intensity levels, and eating habits among a cohort of adolescents during the lockdown period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, most of the participants (63% of total population) declared an active current lifestyle and no changes with regards of eating habits without gender differences. Interestingly, using the KIDMED questionnaire to assess both the score to the MD and the compliance to the MD recommendations, we observed in all adolescents, as well as in females and in males, an average adherence to the MD. This result confirms our previous investigations on MD adherence conducted in a pre-lockdown period on the same group of adolescents and on a sample of adults living in the same Mediterranean area [12,17]. Similarly, Dragun et al.",6be4d23c-fc03-42d0-82b8-4fd1d2f77eed
12,methods12," reported no substantial differences in dietary habits between pre-lockdown and lockdown period, including the overall adherence to the MD and their food choices [18]. In other observations, conflicting data are reported because COVID-19 confinement influenced dietary habits, particularly in younger populations [19]. In fact, data collected by an anonymous online questionnaire on food intake among a group of adolescents from Spain, Italy, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile showed a modified consumption in certain types of foods, such as fried food, sweet food, legumes, vegetables, and fruits which were significantly increased during the lockdown [11]. Moreover, the school closures, coupled with additional socio-behavioral adaptations (e.g.",a704076e-0ae6-4fa6-9004-c7d6536bbb4c
13,methods13,", social distancing, quarantining), had a strong impact on the lifestyle activities of children and adolescents across the whole day leading to significant decreases in PA along with increases in sedentary behavior, and disrupted sleep quality in children and adolescents [20]. As is well known, PA is associated with numerous health benefits for adolescents, including cardio-metabolic effects, motor skill development, bone density, and emotional regulation/psychological health [21,22]. Specifically, guidelines and recommendations provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) for children and adolescents reported that they should participate in moderate-to-vigorous PA at least 1 h per day mostly aerobic, physical activity, across the week, or they should practice vigorous-intensity aerobic activities at least 3 days a week [23].",3b4bfe95-7f17-4be7-adca-4174b7b1f612
14,methods14," Instead, sedentary behaviors indicated often as “screen-based media use behaviors”, including watching television (TV), using computers/smartphones, and playing video games are associated with various negative health consequences [24,25]. The adverse consequences resulting from sedentary behaviors include an increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality [26]. For that reason, based on guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Italian National Institute of Health adapted the recommended levels of PA for different age groups, including in adolescents aged 12–17 years during the COVID-19 outbreak emergency in our country [16,27]. During lockdown, helping to increase the sense of self-efficacy and improve general health of our population, we published a short leaflet and a number of specific suggestions on how to eat well and exercise at home [28].",30c1ea2e-0e19-416e-9b2b-c9d15a7bf5c6
15,methods15," We have also created an official website of DIMENU project [29] and a Facebook page [30] as innovative ways for assuring additional support and information on health-related issues. Notably, in our study, most adolescents, who declared that their lifestyle was active during the lockdown, have also the highest level of Institute of Health (ISS) score confirming the self-perceived PA levels. Similarly, as also reported by another recent survey on students during social confinement, it was observed that adolescents tried to carry out PA, getting interested in cooking, reading, and playing board games at home as well [31]. After dividing the population into the active and sedentary groups, we found that active adolescents closely adhered to food- and nutrient-based recommendations.",81b7af5e-07eb-434c-a23f-190ad0d1fe56
16,methods16," Particularly, we found significant differences in the consumption of some typical Mediterranean foods, such as “a fruit/day”, “more vegetables”, “a second fruit portion/day”, “nuts weekly”, “low-fat dairy products for breakfast” as well as in “skipping breakfast” and “no sweets or candy every day”. Conflicting data are reported on the association between skipping breakfast and overweight/obesity in adolescents [32]. Thus, further studies are needed to clarify the effects of breakfast on weight management. Our results are in line with other studies in which an increase of consumption of junk food, sweets, and candy were related to the sedentary behavior [9]. In addition, based on our data we highlight the impact of PA on the adherence to the MD and on a subjective well-being and healthy lifestyle in adolescents.",622410a1-08df-49f3-be4e-6594691c2378
17,methods17," In this context, we have recently described that PA associated with a nutrition education program improves the adherence to the MD and reduces systemic inflammation in adolescents, suggesting that their combined promotion represent a strategy for assuring the prevention and control of chronic non-communicable diseases over the entire lifespan [33]. Experiences from previous epidemics have also shown that there is a need to maintain optimal nutrition at individual and global levels, in order to positively influence the physical and mental health of the population [34]. In this sense, the knowledge of the dietary and lifestyle habits in each age range is necessary to promote MD patterns and regular PA as a priority public health action after COVID-19 confinement or to develop future reactions to unavoidable pandemics.  This study includes some limitations, such as the small sample size and the online survey.",78c1f1a9-a40d-407b-b708-fd73617f1568
18,methods18," Although a large study population may strengthen the results, in our web survey conducted over a short timeframe a small group of subjects interviewed was sufficient to quickly obtain a picture of adolescent behavior. Regarding the online questionnaire that we used to perform this study, this method does not permit achieving a comparable response quality respect to traditional ones, however, during the lockdown period it represented a unique alternative approach for data collection. We also used a website to promote MD pattern and foster to increase PA intensity levels [29].  5. Conclusions  In summary, data from our web survey report that active adolescents have higher adherence to the MD, a subjective well-being and life satisfaction level related to PA respect to sedentary underlining the impact of the PA intensity level on the eating habits and healthy behaviors during the lockdown.",28acb88e-c86a-454b-8dee-75af9f1a6005
19,methods19," These findings suggest the usefulness of planning effective education programs including energy and nutritionally balanced diets as well as regular PA, as a part of wellness programs and of interventions in adolescence for a healthy lifestyle. ",dc532ed6-0e37-41b1-a893-15a6f5b6eca6
