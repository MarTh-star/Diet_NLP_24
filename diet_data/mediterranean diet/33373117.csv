0,background0," The combination of excess body weight and physical inactivity contributes to global mortality [1,2] and to a shorter healthy life expectancy [3]. Moreover, both are associated with a major risk for serious chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, as well as increasing cardiovascular risk factors [4]. Such conditions may impact individual quality of life and well-being while increasing the burden on the health system [5]. Several strategies have been implemented to tackle obesity, mainly focusing on changing lifestyles. In general, weight loss interventions aim to increase physical activity, reduce daily energy intake, improve diet or nutritional habits, and achieve psychological changes [6]. Owing to the complex nature of obesity, multicomponent interventions, capable of addressing various aspects related to its causes, are shown to be more effective in reducing cardiovascular risk factors [7] and body weight [8].",90319252-0e3d-4a66-894e-7bd1a46cc454
1,background1," However, finding accessible and cost-effective multicomponent strategies that promote healthy lifestyles over time is challenging.  Mobile Health  Mobile health (mHealth) approaches, which are defined as the use of mobile wireless technologies for health [9], could optimize these efforts as portable and flexible tools, as well as improve the follow-up and feedback by registering health information [10] and provide efficient health management assistance for patients [11]. Specifically, some reviews suggested that mHealth could be more effective in losing weight than traditional approaches [12,13]. Among mHealth tools, smartphones are positioned as the most effective approach to achieve weight management [14], showing the most beneficial effects in the short term [15] (≤6 months).",447c71c1-3d09-4f10-b7ed-42f0404acfeb
2,background2," However, mobile phone intervention reports modest improvements in other lifestyles such as physical activity [16] or changes in biomarkers [13], highlighting the need to complement the intervention with other tools. Along these lines, wearable devices have garnered attention in improving physical activity and reducing sedentary lifestyle. Pedometer-based interventions have been widely explored [17], but the constant evolution of these tools requires the inclusion of emerging electronic devices [18]. Activity tracker wristbands, also called “smart bands,” have shown their validity and reliability in measuring physical activity outcomes [19] (eg, steps, kilometer walked, and intensity).",119f490d-5c92-40f3-872e-d69ee341e57d
3,background3," Furthermore, a recent systematic review found that these device-based interventions are effective for increasing physical activity among chronic disease populations [20], making activity tracker wristbands a good option for inclusion in lifestyle interventions, as wearable activity trackers have the potential to increase physical activity participation [21]. However, wearable activity trackers alone may not be sufficient to achieve the expected lifestyle changes [22], so their inclusion in mHealth multicomponent obesity interventions, which appears to be more effective than app interventions alone [23], could be a beneficial strategy to obtain positive results in diet, physical activity, or other health variables [24,25]. In addition, self-monitoring in digital health interventions is associated with greater weight loss [26], so the use of both approaches could produce better weight outcomes.",12601f83-04b8-4047-a91d-93b45d1cdcea
4,background4,"  Despite these promising results, the evidence for long-term efficacy is still limited, revealing that more evidence of effectiveness over long follow-up periods is required [27]. A systematic review showed that wearable devices might improve long-term physical activity and weight loss outcomes, although a comparison with traditional methods did not show clear benefits [28]. A similar situation exists with regard to multicomponent interventions with wearables, which may provide a strategy to improve long-term weight loss [29] despite the limited data on its effectiveness.  Objectives  Previously, the Evident 2 study evaluated the effect of adding an app (Evident 2) to a standardized intervention designed to improve adherence to the Mediterranean diet and increase physical activity in the general population [30].",dcbaf25e-29b6-49fb-924c-dc1e86f13cb4
5,background5," The Evident 3 study aimed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness (12 months) of a multicomponent mHealth intervention—combining a later version of the smartphone app (Evident 3) and a smart band, compared with a brief counseling–only group—on body weight loss, improving body composition, increasing time spent in physical activity, and decreasing caloric intake in Spanish sedentary adults with overweight and obesity. The short-term study results (3 months) related to body composition have already been published [31]. ",21d08ec0-0805-4e0f-8794-88cc01309e1c
6,methods0," Design and Setting  A multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial with 2 parallel groups was conducted in a primary care setting (Evident 3 study). The Primary Care Research Unit of Salamanca (APISAL) at the Biomedical Research Institute of Salamanca (Institute of Salamanca (IBSAL)) coordinated the project in 5 health centers located in Spain from the Network for Preventive Activity and Health Promotion (REDIAPP; Salamanca, Valladolid, Cuenca, Palma de Mallorca, and Zaragoza). The main aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of the intervention on weight loss in participants with overweight and obesity [32] (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03175614). Between June 2017 and June 2020, evaluations were made at baseline and after the completion of 3 and 12 months. The results presented in this paper correspond to the long-term effect (12 months) of the 3-month mHealth intervention on the primary outcome (weight loss) and secondary outcomes related to physical activity and diet.",b976de7b-c265-4ad7-a7fc-a2348b3d9a8a
7,methods1,"  Study Population  The participants were selected by random sampling among patients who attended a consultation with their primary care provider in each participating center. The inclusion criteria were age between 20 and 65 years, a BMI between 27.5 kg/m2 and 40 kg/m2, classified as sedentary (20 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity ≤3 times per week; 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity ≤5 times per week; or any combination of moderate and vigorous activity ≤5 times per week [33]), agreement to participate in the study, and signing the informed consent document.

8,methods2,"20, with an SD of 12 kg, estimated in participants from the Evident 2 study [30], 592 participants would be needed (296 per group) to detect a decrease in weight of ≥3 kg [34] in the intervention group (IG) versus the control group (CG), considering a 15% loss to follow-up. This effect size represents a 3% to 5% difference between groups, which should produce clinically relevant health benefits [35].  Randomization  Participants were randomly assigned to either the IG or the CG after the baseline visit and provided informed consent. The allocation sequence was generated in a 1:1 ratio using the Epidat (version 4.2; Xunta de Galicia) software package [36] by an independent researcher and concealed until the group was assigned. Owing to the nature of the study, the intervention could not be blinded to the participants.  Procedures  Each participant completed an initial visit and 2 follow-up visits at 3 and 12 months after randomization (Figure 1).",330f1a9f-899e-4ec7-acbe-11eb29f18e22
9,methods3," They did not receive any compensation for the study or visit completion. Data from the visits were collected by a research nurse on a paper-based Case Report Form and recorded after the visit on the study website. The IG completed an additional appointment 7 days from the baseline visit to explain the use of the smartphone app and set it with the participant’s data. The researcher who carried out the additional appointment was different from the researcher who collected the data of the visits.  Figure 1 Flowchart of the Evident 3 study.  Primary and Secondary Outcomes  Overview  The primary outcome was weight loss (kg). The secondary outcomes included changes in physical activity (min/week), caloric intake (kcal/day), adherence to the Mediterranean diet (points), and changes in body composition (anthropometric indexes). All outcomes were measured at baseline and at 3 and 12 months after randomization.  Weight Loss  Body weight was measured twice to the nearest 0.",6baec18e-5e2b-4bea-bb9c-fa2f5e9ddb30

Height was measured with the participant barefoot in the standing position using a portable system (Seca 222; Medical scale and measurement system). BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height squared (m2). Waist circumference was measured twice on bare skin, using a flexible tape parallel to the floor, at the level of the upper border of the iliac crest, with the participant standing and after inspiration, following the recommendations of the Spanish Society for the Study of Obesity [37]. Hip circumference was similarly measured at the level of the trochanters over the underwear.  In addition, anthropometric indices were estimated to evaluate body composition changes:  Waist–height ratio = WC / Height (1)  Body adiposity index = [HC / (Height1.5)] − 18 (2)  Waist–hip ratio = WC / HC (3)  Body shape index [38] = WC / [(BMI0.",05a1b80f-e7a0-4bc1-8ac0-7d80ead3a0c0

The IPAQ-SF is a self-reported questionnaire that evaluates sitting and active time in the last 7 days through 7 questions. The categories consisted of walking, moderate-intensity activity, and vigorous-intensity activity, according to the energy expenditure estimated for each of them: 3.3, 4.0, and 8.0 metabolic equivalents (METs), respectively; 1 MET being the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest [41]. Thus, the IPAQ-SF enables METs-minutes per week to be calculated, and participants were stratified into 3 activity levels (low, intermediate, and high).",1eff3f4c-8a9b-4590-b96a-da59fb690f87
12,methods6,"  Nutritional Habits  Caloric intake (kcal/day) and dietary habits of participants were evaluated using a semiquantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire previously validated in the Spanish population [42]. The frequency options are divided into 9 intake categories, ranging from never to >6 servings per day. Food Frequency Questionnaire data were used to estimate the daily intake of macro- and micronutrients and the mean kcal/day.  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using the validated 14-point Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener [43] developed by the prevention with Mediterranean diet study group, which comprises 12 questions on food consumption frequency and 2 questions on food intake habits. Each question was scored as 0 or 1, and the total score ranged from 0 to 14. A total score of 9 points or higher indicated adequate adherence.",41bf6026-3ce6-4f92-a930-7de295b54bf6
13,methods7,"  Adherence to Self-monitoring on the Smartphone App  Adherence to self-monitoring on the smartphone app was assessed by the number of days that the participants logged into the app and recorded any dish or food. Records were classified into 4 categories: 0 days, 1 to 30 days, 31 to 60 days, and >60 days. Participants who used the app for >60 days during the 3 months that they had the app were classified as sufficiently adherent, whereas ≤60 days of use was classified as having low adherence.  Other Variables  Sociodemographic Variables  Data on age, sex, marital status, educational level, and occupation were collected at the time of inclusion in the study.  Peripheral Blood Pressure  Three measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were performed using the average of the last 2 measurements with a validated Omron M10-IT model sphygmomanometer (Omron Healthcare).",71ab43fa-4b93-4110-ad6c-de0902cc6eb5
14,methods8," The measurements were made on both arms, with the participant seated, after at least 5 minutes of rest with an appropriately sized cuff, following the recommendations of the European Society of Hypertension [44].  Smoking Status  This was assessed through a questionnaire of 4 standard questions adapted from the World Health Organization monitoring of trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease study [45]. Study participants were classified as current smokers, former smokers (>1 year without smoking), or nonsmokers.  Intervention  A detailed description of brief counseling and specific intervention has been published in the study protocol [32]. All the intervention materials were provided in Spanish.",a86109ce-80ed-48bb-9fce-067264999969
15,methods9,"  Standard Counseling (CG and IG)  A trained nurse at each primary health center, who was not involved in other aspects of the study, gave 5 minutes of lifestyle counseling to both groups (CG and IG) before randomization, focusing on physical activity and diet in compliance with the international recommendations for the general population. The health benefits of physical activity were explained as well as the recommendation to complete at least 30 minutes of moderate activity 5 days a week, or 20 minutes of vigorous activity 3 days a week. Counseling on food was in compliance with the plate method [46], in which a plate is divided into 4 parts: half the plate for salad or vegetables, one-quarter for proteins (white meat preferred over red meat), and the final quarter for carbohydrates. In addition, a medium-sized piece of fruit and a skimmed dairy product should be consumed for dessert.",940dec3d-b1db-489f-9ccb-0dd3e5af455c

No reinforcement of counseling was offered at any other study visit or between the 3- and 12-month visits.  Specific Intervention (IG)  The IG received a low-intensity intervention consisting of a smartphone with the EVIDENT 3 app (Samsung Galaxy J3) and a smart band (Xiaomi Mi Band 2) for 3 months, corresponding to the length of the intervention, without any additional reinforcement or counseling by the investigators throughout the study. Participants were trained at another 15-minute visit scheduled 7 days after the baseline visit in the use of the app (EVIDENT 3 app [record entry no. 00/2017/2438]) specifically designed for the study by CGB Computer Company and APISAL, as well as the use of the smart band, instructing them to use both tools daily.",d4fce8c5-d3c9-4b52-b07f-608b5a9d755b
17,methods11,"  During this visit, the app was configured with each participant’s data (sex, age, weight, and height). It was designed to allow full daily self-monitoring of food intake (Figure 2) and automatically record physical activity through the smart band, which was configured to synchronize with the app. Participants entered their food intake daily by selecting dishes and foods from the app menu and indicating the portion size. Food composition data were collected from the Spanish Food Composition Database [47], developed by Spanish Food Composition Database Network and Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition. Once all the daily information is collected, the app integrates the data to create personalized healthy food recommendations based on the Mediterranean diet pattern and specific targets for daily calorie intake that would lead to weight loss. The app displays the amount of calories recorded (Figure 2) and a bar that changes color (green, yellow, or red) according to the level set.",94a2b466-537f-4177-8d26-ae3c3a36c73c

The lower limit (the black line) was 85% of the calories calculated, and below this, the bar appeared in green; between the red and black lines, it appeared in yellow; and above the red line, it appeared in red. The participant was able to consult the app for these recommendations as well as information about caloric intake changes and macronutrient distribution (carbohydrates, proteins, and unsaturated and saturated fats). The smart band was set to congratulate the user when reaching 10,000 steps/day, and the app displayed this step recommendation in the goals section. Behavioral strategies were included in the mHealth intervention to enhance self-efficacy using self-monitoring, goal-setting, and positive reinforcement.",b195f303-6b44-4af3-8734-0e49a591d7be
19,methods13," At the 3-month visit, participants returned the intervention tools to the researchers. Thereafter, participants did not have access to the intervention devices and were advised not to use other digital tools for weight loss until the end of the study. All the information generated by the app was duly analyzed and entered into the database. In addition, once the tools were returned, monthly mean daily steps and activity minutes were collected for the last 2 of the 3 months of the intervention from the Mi Fit app (Xiaomi) to assess whether the smart band was worn.

In addition, the app was not available for download on the internet or anywhere until the end of the study, so the CG was not able to make use of it in any way. During the follow-up visits, participants were instructed not to use other digital health technologies.  Statistical Analysis  Baseline characteristics of the study population were expressed as mean and SD for quantitative variables and as frequency distributions for categorical variables. Student t test (2-tailed), chi-square test, and Fisher exact test were used to determine differences in baseline characteristics between the IG and CG.

Although both groups had reduced weight, BMI, and other anthropometric variables, the IG showed a greater trend to reduce weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference, waist–height ratio, and body adiposity index at the 3-month follow-up and did not maintain a downward trend at the 12-month visit. Regarding diet, both groups decreased their caloric intake (kcal) and improved their Mediterranean diet adherence, but no differences between groups were found.",8e236bcb-a7dc-44ce-ac3b-388c3393507a
30,discussion1," A similar result was observed in physical activity, where physical activity time increased in both groups, but the IG showed an increase in weekly light physical activity (LPA) time at 12 months. Analyses stratified by baseline characteristics showed patterns toward greater changes in body composition variables in women, people aged >50 years, and married people.  Weight  Findings from meta-analyses have shown that mHealth weight loss interventions were effective in comparison with minimal intervention or control in the short term but with inconclusive long-term results [15,16]. The Evident 3 study provides insights into the long-term effects of weight loss, BMI, and other anthropometric variables at 3 months, but this trend was not maintained in the period when they no longer had access to the devices up to the 12-month visit. In addition, overall weight reduction in the IG was 2.05% at 3 months, so clinically relevant weight loss was not achieved (>5%).",6a9a9736-f75f-4a37-8892-0b0133462fba
31,discussion2,"  Despite the heterogeneity found in these types of interventions, some systematic reviews [23,49] suggest that the combination of mHealth tools could be useful for changing lifestyles to healthier ones, but its effect on weight loss remains unclear. Along these lines, the Innovative Approaches to Diet, Exercise and Activity study, which provided a wearable technology combined with a website to the enhanced IG, found no significant difference in weight or physical activity between groups [29] across the 24-month intervention in young adults. Moreover, another study that evaluated the effect of a web-based weight loss program with and without an activity tracking device found that its addition to the intervention did not produce higher changes in weight loss at the 12-month follow-up [50] than those in the CG.",758f00e3-7e32-4157-bff1-906f101927e3
32,discussion3," In contrast, the Quant study, whose intervention included 3 feedback devices (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis scale, blood pressure, and step counter) found a positive effect on fat loss at the 12-month follow-up [51]. These results are consistent with those found in our study, where there were differences between groups in weight, body composition variables, and physical activity but without reaching clinically relevant results.  Notwithstanding the effectiveness of self-monitoring behaviors in weight management [52], the challenge lies in finding a way to keep the users using the app, because the frequency of logging into the app is highly related to weight loss success in web-based interventions [53] and mHealth apps [52], as the user adopts new behaviors over time that is supported by the tools. In this regard, the rate of users who adhered sufficiently to the study app (150/318, 47.2%) may be insufficient to show better results in the main outcomes at 12 months.",10ea7703-7c39-49ca-8fc2-2f9601c597cb
33,discussion4," It should also be noted that between the period in which mHealth tools were collected at the 3-month follow-up and the 12-month visit, there was no reinforcement or any contact with the participants by the researchers. Therefore, despite not obtaining clinically relevant weight loss, the results suggest that the intervention should be modified (longer intervention period, improved adherence strategies, some professional support, etc), as the trend of weight reduction was not maintained over time when tools were removed. Moreover, the CG also reported weight loss but lower than that of the IG, which is commonly reported in weight loss interventions [25], especially if the CG received usual care [54].  Physical Activity and Diet  The study intervention, which included an activity tracker wristband, was shown to increase weekly light physical activity (LPA) time measured by the IPAQ-SF.",2ac5c90c-c30d-47a9-9300-fff1e64b31af
34,discussion5," Increasing light physical activity (LPA) may improve important health outcomes, such as markers of lipid and glucose metabolism and mortality in the general population [55]. Although the general physical activity recommendations are based on promoting moderate to vigorous physical activity, increasing light physical activity (LPA) in the sedentary population may be a good starting point for decreasing inactivity in people with overweight and obesity [56]. Previous studies have reported beneficial changes in physical activity variables, observing a small increase in moderate to vigorous physical activity in women [57] and people with overweight and obesity [22] or in steps per day [20] in people with chronic diseases.",a4e73300-761f-4aef-8562-18e716b30774
35,discussion6," Specifically, a recent study reported increased resistance training and reduced energy intake at 6 months using a multicomponent mHealth intervention [25], showing the potential of these tools in physical activity promotion by allowing a more tailored intervention and greater feedback.  Furthermore, energy intake was reduced, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased in both groups. However, the app intervention did not achieve better results than the CG. Potential explanations for this include that the brief diet counseling using the plate method was explained at the end of the baseline visit, which could lead to an improvement in the entire sample. Moreover, Solbrig et al [58] suggested that there is a mismatch between people’s need for help and what weight management apps provide, as people dislike counting calories, the basis of most self-management apps, and need more tailored support and motivational elements.",6b161a1d-b9bb-4aa2-a55c-525d762e04a8
36,discussion7," Along these lines, a recent study found that a digital app that provides personalized nutritional recommendations appeared to be successful in reducing weight in users with obesity [59]. Future research will focus on the inclusion of new adaptive features in health apps to achieve greater results in health outcomes and higher rates of intervention adherence.  Analyses of the Effect Stratified by Baseline Characteristics  These analyses showed that the intervention was more effective in specific groups than in the general IG. Women showed greater weight loss, BMI changes, and other anthropometric variables, whereas men did not show differences. This could be explained by the higher rate of participation by women in this study (445/650, 68.5%), following the trend of weight management studies [60] and by the lower number of men included (n=205), which may have resulted in an underpowered analysis to find differences in the male group.",4825e55e-09be-42b1-a43c-23303e515deb
37,discussion8," In addition, women are more likely to participate in weight loss interventions [61] and use health apps [62], so the sex factor has to be considered. Regarding age, people aged >50 years obtained differences in more outcomes than younger people, and they were more adherent to the self-monitoring on the app. A systematic review found that middle-aged adults are more willing to adhere to such interventions with activity trackers [63] than younger people, so it is feasible that differences are found between age groups, as in the study results. In terms of marital status, married people seem to benefit more from the intervention. However, the unequal size of the groups could explain why single people, who obtained higher median adherence days than married people, did not show positive results.",7af5bb74-2110-45f6-8ba4-581687bc0671
38,discussion9," The influence of sociodemographic factors on the digital intervention effect, or adherence, has to be explored in-depth, but a study among users of eHealth approaches suggested that married people, among other characteristics, generally used more mHealth apps [64], which might lead to more positive results. Although more research is needed to determine which personal factors could influence mHealth effectiveness, these analyses highlight the need to develop more tailored interventions, adapting them according to certain characteristics of the user to enhance the effect of these digital approaches.  Finally, the average dropout rate was higher than expected (207/650, 31.8%) but balanced between study groups (IG: 102/318, 32.1% vs CG: 105/332, 31.6%). As a group, the participants who dropped out of the study were younger, with greater mean weight, BMI >30 kg/m2, and a higher proportion of smokers, in line with the dropout predictors found by a systematic review [65].",f44b9614-59e7-47ae-8c51-70dcef81bcdb
39,discussion10," The participant attrition rate from digital interventions often exceeds 20% [66], and it is common to find large dropouts in weight management mobile phone apps [67] and multicomponent interventions [51]. Potential explanations could be participants’ higher weight loss expectations [65] and experiencing difficulty in maintaining self-monitoring.  Strengths and Limitations  This study had several strengths. The study included a large sample with a multisite design with a wide range of ages and educational background, which offers robustness to the results obtained. Both the intervention and the statistical analysis were conducted by blinding researchers to the assignment groups. The 3- and 12-month visits allowed evaluation of the short-term and long-term effects of this type of technology on weight loss in the absence of additional face-to-face intervention. Moreover, the adherence rate to the self-monitoring diet on the app was acceptable (median percentage of days 71.7%).",c2110741-78be-48f6-860a-34a5e18f09c7
40,discussion11,"  In addition, some limitations of this study should be noted. Although participants were instructed not to use any other mHealth tool that could interfere with the study, there are no guarantees to ensure this occurred. The data collected from the smart band did not allow for the assessment of daily use and adherence to this device. In addition, the nature of the intervention precludes blinding of the participants, although recent findings suggest that blinding is less important than often believed [68]. The exposure time to the intervention (3 months) might not be sufficient to identify more positive results in changing lifestyles and weight loss. The number of participants in each baseline characteristics (sex, age, and marital status) group could be insufficient to show more relevant effects in the stratified analysis. Finally, the dropout rate of 31.",9db0140d-43fb-4e07-b86a-c65dd713a2d1
41,discussion12,"8% (207/650) may have biased the final sample study composition and underpowered the study with regard to detecting a significant effect in the results between groups. However, random allocation and a balanced dropout between arms show that the group characteristics differ little from the initial sample, making the comparison between groups possible [69].  Conclusions  The low-intensity intervention of the Evident 3 study showed in the IG, benefits on weight loss, some body composition variables, and time spent in light physical activity (LPA) compared with the CG at 3 months, but once the devices were collected, the downward trend was not maintained at the 12-month follow-up. No differences in nutritional outcomes were observed between the groups. Analyses stratified by baseline characteristics revealed that the intervention was more effective in women, people aged ≥50 years, and married participants.",87aa1266-2ec6-48c1-ae21-b795524798c7
42,discussion13," Further research is needed to determine the optimum intervention period to achieve greater results, as well as the inclusion of more tailored strategies in health apps and weight management interventions that improve intervention adherence and retention rates.
