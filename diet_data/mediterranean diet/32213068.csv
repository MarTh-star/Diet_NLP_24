0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Volunteers  A new form of natto using polyamine-rich soybeans and a suitable production method was developed for the study [20]. None of the soybeans or fungi were transgenic. After flavor tests, the natto contained 1880 nmol/g of spermidine and 390 nmol/g of spermine. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Saitama Medical Center (No. Rin15-35) and registered at the Center for Clinical Trials of the Japan Medical Association (JMACCT CTR; ID: JMA-IIA00233, Title: Trial to confirm biological activities in humans after long term intake of polyamine-rich food -interventional trial using newly developed fermented soybeans “Natto”-; https://dbcentre3.jmacct.med.or.jp/JMACTR/App/JMACTRS06/JMACTRS06.aspx?seqno=5483 (accessed on 29 March 2021) before the recruitment of subjects.  Healthy male volunteers aged 40 to 70 were chosen as subjects because blood polyamine levels in females change during the menstrual cycle [21].",d27ddeef-27d0-4b4d-9e6a-8f7684c1a7ce
1,methods1," After a verbal and written explanation of the study, volunteers were asked to join one arm of the study. Those who wanted to join the intervention group were asked to eat 45 to 90 g (1 to 2 packs) of the polyamine-rich natto every day for one year. Volunteers who joined the control group were asked not to change their dietary pattern. We asked all subjects to record all meals and snacks as images or in writing for 14 consecutive days and send records four times: before, and after 4, 8, and 12 months of the study. Blood sampling was performed at these time points.  2.2. Blood Tests  Blood tests were commissioned to SRL (a clinical laboratory testing company, Tokyo, Japan). High-density lipoprotein (High density lipoprotein (HDL)) cholesterol (mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) cholesterol (mg/dL) were measured by direct methods, and total cholesterol (T-Cho) (mg/dL) was measured using the Ultra Violet-End method using cholesterol dehydrogenase.",fab0fe45-d149-4601-ab3e-5e1cc325b475
2,methods2," High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (ng/mL) was measured by a chemiluminescent enzyme immunometric assay (Latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay). A lymphocyte activation test upon concanavaline-A (Con-A) stimulation was performed, and the stimulation index (SI) was calculated using radioactivity (3H-thymidine) uptake of stimulated blood cells divided by that of non-stimulated blood cells.  2.3. Flow Cytometric Analysis  We isolated PBMCs by density gradient centrifugation, using SepMate-50™ (Veritas Corp. Tokyo, Japan) and Lymphoprep™ (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway). Five mL of blood was diluted by 5 mL of PBS. Diluted blood was poured down the side wall of the tube (SepMate-50) in which 15 mL of lymphoprep was filled in the lower chamber. PBMCs isolated after centrifugation (1200× g for 10 min) were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in the stain buffer (BD Pharmingen™) at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/mL.",cffc81b1-609f-4262-bea3-7182a6b0d221
3,methods3," FITC-conjugated anti-human CD11a antibody (BD Pharmingen™) or isotype control (20 µL per 1 × 107 cells) was added to the cell suspension. A FACScan flow cytometer (FACSVerse™) with software (BD FACSuite) was used for analysis. Expression of CD11a on 3 × 104 cells gated in the lymphocyte and monocyte light-scattered areas was analyzed. Data are expressed as mean fluorescent intensities (Mean fluorescent intensities (MFI)s).  2.4. Determination of Polyamine Concentrations in Whole Blood  Whole blood cells were degraded by sonication and a freeze-thaw cycle, and stored at −80 °C. We determined polyamine concentrations by high-performance liquid chromatography (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)), after homogenization and extraction of polyamines with 0.2 N trichloroacetic acid (trichloroacetic acid (TCA)) and centrifugation at 27,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C.",5392b4f7-ee90-4923-9aa9-8340d32e3276
4,methods4," Polyamines in 10 µL of the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) supernatant were separated on a Toyo Soda high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with a TSK gel IEX215 column (4 × 80 mm) at 50 °C. The flow rate of the buffer (0.35 M citric acid buffer [pH 5.35, 2 M NaCl, 20% methanol) was 0.35 mL/min. Polyamines were detected by fluorescence intensity after the reaction of the column effluent at 50 °C with a solution containing 0.06% o-phthalaldehyde, 0.4 M boric buffer (pH 10.4), 0.1% Brij 35, and 37 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The flow rate of the o-phthalaldehyde solution was 0.8 mL/min, and fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 388 nm and an emission wavelength of 410 nm. The retention times for spermidine and spermine were 15 and 27 min. The concentrations are expressed as µM.  2.5. Statistical Analysis  Data are expressed as mean ± SD of the number (n) of samples, and some data are also shown as a percentage.",ac7d704a-dc0f-41d2-87b8-654c2554dfa7
5,methods5," Averages of two groups were compared by unpaired t-test for data with a normal distribution and by Mann–Whitney test when data for the two groups were unequally distributed, with p < 0.05 considered significant in all analyses. The odds ratio to decrease LFA-1 by increased polyamine intake was tested by 2 × 2 contingency table analysis. The relationship between two parameters was examined by linear regression analysis.  Regarding the data of subjects who dropped out the study, we also evaluated using the last observation carried forward method (last observation carried forward method (LOCF)) and mean imputation method (mean imputation method (MIM)) approaches.  3. Results  3.1. Subjects and Pre-Intervention Parameters  The intervention and control groups included 30 and 27 males, respectively, with ages ranging from 40 to 69 years, with a median age of 48.91 ± 7.89; 50.20 ± 7.85 in the intervention group and 47.48 ± 7.84 in the control group (p = 0.993, t-test).",c1f514dd-0c09-4348-992f-75abce2b6d2f
6,methods7," Mono-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI)s had no correlation with Spermidine (SPD) (r = −0.059, p = 0.662) (Figure 1f). While no correlation was found between mono-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI) and age (r = 0.080, p = 0.557) (Figure 1d), CD11a expression on cells in the lymphocyte light-scattering area (lymph-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI)) was positively correlated with age (r = 0.532, p < 0.001) (Figure 1h). Lymph-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI)s had no significant correlation with spermine (SPM) (r =−0.095, p = 0.482) (Figure 1i), Spermidine (SPD) (r = −0.081, p = 0.550) (Figure 1j), or spermine (SPM)/Spermidine (SPD) ratio (r = −0.007, p = 0.960) (Figure 1k).  3.2.

7,methods8," The mean blood spermine (SPM) concentration in the intervention group was lower than that in the control group before intervention, but increased gradually during the intervention and became higher than that of the control group at 12 months, but without significance (Table 1) (p = 0.958 at 4 months, p = 0.835 at 8 months, p = 0.692 at 12 months by last observation carried forward method (LOCF), and p = 0.982 at 4 months, p = 0.842 at 8 months, p = 0.675 at 12 months by mean imputation method (MIM)). Spermidine (SPD) did not differ significantly between the two groups in blood tests at all time points. Mono-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI) was significantly higher in the intervention group before the intervention (2040.20 ± 185.55 vs. 1891.59 ± 241.72, p = 0.011) and at 4 months (1851.90 ± 174.40 vs. 1716.58 ± 242.24, p = 0.019), while lymph-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI) did not differ.",1942a93c-6659-44a7-bbab-3c3e4f0c2049
8,methods9," hs-CRP was high in the intervention group at 12 months, but with no significant difference from the control group. SI, High density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and T-Cho did not differ significantly between the two groups in blood tests at all time points (Table 1). Two subjects in the control group subsequently dropped out of the study.  3.3. Changes in Parameters during the Intervention  Changes in parameters (measured values) at 4, 8, and 12 months relative to pre-intervention values are shown in Table 2. In the intervention group, the relative mean blood spermine (SPM) concentrations at 4, 8, and 12 months were higher in the intervention group than in the control group, with a significant difference at 12 months (1.12 ± 0.29 (range 0.804–2.358) vs. 0.97 ± 0.19 (0.682–1.429), p = 0.019). In contrast, mean blood Spermidine (SPD) levels did not change in either group and were similar in the two groups throughout the study.",469d7390-41c3-4dfa-90a2-5faa8e8d1b22
9,methods10," Thus, the blood spermine (SPM)/Spermidine (SPD) ratio in the intervention group tended to become higher than that in the control group at 8 and 12 months, but with no significance (p = 0.105 at 12 months) (Table 2).  hs-CRP increased (2733.60 ± 11253.34) in the intervention group, but decreased in the control group (−510.44 ± 1589.16) after 12 months, with a significant difference in these data (p = 0.007). Mono-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI) decreased over time in the intervention group, but the value at each time point did not differ significantly from the corresponding value in the control group. Numerical changes of SI, High density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and T-Cho were not significant and were similar in the intervention and control groups (Table 2).  3.4.

Figure 2 shows the results evaluated using the last observation carried forward method (last observation carried forward method (LOCF)) approach. The estimated increases in Spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPM) intake in the intervention group were 96.63 ± 47.70 and 22.00 ± 9.56 µmol/day, respectively, while those in the control group decreased slightly by −2.63 ± 11.60 and −0.34 ± 1.48 µmol/day, respectively, with a significant difference in the changes in polyamine intake between the two groups (p < 0.001).",1df1860f-d3e2-484f-bed6-a136fe0e4400
11,methods12,"  The changes (values at 12 months after intervention minus values at pre-intervention) of polyamine (Spermidine (SPD) plus spermine (SPM)), Spermidine (SPD), and spermine (SPM) intakes were compared with the relative changes of blood polyamine (Spermidine (SPD) plus spermine (SPM)), Spermidine (SPD), and spermine (SPM) levels at 12 months after intervention to those of pre-intervention.  Changes in polyamine (Spermidine (SPD) plus spermine (SPM)) intake after intervention had a positive correlation (r = 0.335, p = 0.015) with blood spermine (SPM) levels at 12 months relative to pre-intervention levels (Figure 2a). However, there were wide inter-individual differences in increases of blood spermine (SPM) in response to increased polyamine intake. Increases in polyamine intake were not significantly correlated with changes in blood Spermidine (SPD) (r = 0.215, p = 0.109) (Figure 2b) or the spermine (SPM)/Spermidine (SPD) ratio (r = 0.214, p = 0.110) (Figure 2c) at 12 months.",5f38e9c8-50aa-429d-966c-6bc317335987

13,methods14,"  The results were the same when raw data of 30 volunteers in the intervention group and 24 in the control group were analyzed. In addition, when we evaluated using the mean imputation method (mean imputation method (MIM)) approach, the results were the same.  3.5. Changes in Parameters of Subjects Without Acute Inflammation and Evaluation of the Effects of spermine (SPM) on LFA-1 Expression in Monocytes  Inflammation significantly affects LFA-1 expression (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material) and hs-CRP is a marker of inflammation, with an acute increase in hs-CRP, indicating acute inflammation. Therefore, an analysis was performed after the exclusion of subjects in whom hs-CRP at 4, 8, 12 months changed (increased or decreased) by more than 3000 ng/mL from the pre-intervention value (Table 3). In this analysis, the mean value of the relative blood spermine (SPM) levels at 12 months compared to pre-intervention increased significantly by 1.08 ± 0.18 times (p = 0.",ee376679-8717-464b-b7fd-6e7ebd46469d

The mean mono-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI) in the intervention group tended to decrease with time, and the change at 12 months was significantly lower than that in the control group (−247.83 ± 148.76 vs. −85.04 ± 257.39, p = 0.019).  Relative blood spermine (SPM) levels at 12 months compared to pre-intervention showed a negative relationship with changes in mono-CD11a Mean fluorescent intensities (MFI)s from pre-intervention to 12 months after intervention in all subjects, but without significance (p = 0.114). The same lot of CD11a antibody for flow cytometry could not be used throughout the intervention due to the limited expiration date. To correct the difference of antibody titer, individual pre-intervention mono-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI)s were adjusted (estimated values) by the difference (−164.",4c5c1b2a-b89e-43ff-b03c-e1010c6064b7

In the intervention group, the actual values were higher than the estimated values in 5 subjects and lower than the estimated values in 18 subjects. In the control group, 12 subjects had higher and 11 had lower actual values compared to estimated values. Contingency table analysis revealed that the odds ratio to decrease mono-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI) by increased polyamine intake was 3.927 (95% CI 1.116–13.715) (p = 0.032 by Pearson uncorrected test).  3.6.",36e88fa9-fc89-41c7-9f81-ee54ed5ab718
16,methods17," Evaluation of the Effects of Changes in Polyamine Concentrations on LFA-1 Expression in the Monocyte Area  We further evaluated the effects of changes in polyamine concentrations on LFA-1 expression in the monocyte area (mono-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI)s). Numerical changes at each time point (4, 8, and 12 months after intervention) from pre-intervention values of polyamines (Spermidine (SPD) & spermine (SPM)) and CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI) using last observation carried forward method (LOCF) and mean imputation method (MIM) (in parentheses) approaches are shown in Table 4.

The mean blood spermine (SPM)/Spermidine (SPD) ratio of 4, 8, and 12 months relative to that of pre-intervention value was slightly higher in the intervention group than in the control group, while no significant difference was observed.  Mean difference in mono-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI)s between before and after 4 months after intervention in the intervention group was similar to that of the control group (p = 0.521 by last observation carried forward method (LOCF), p = 0.647 by mean imputation method (MIM)).",075f1744-4169-47ff-8fd4-01f4ea34405d
18,methods19," However, the values in the intervention group decreased throughout the trial period, and the difference between pre-intervention and 8 and 12 months after the start of the study in the intervention group became significantly different from those in the control group at 8 and 12 months after intervention (p = 0.020 by last observation carried forward method (LOCF), p = 0.026 by mean imputation method (MIM) at 8 months) (p = 0.006 by last observation carried forward method (LOCF), p = 0.010 by mean imputation method (MIM) at 12 months).  The relationship between two parameters was examined by linear regression analysis using the last observation carried forward method (LOCF) approach. The changes in blood spermine (SPM) concentrations after 12 months of intervention (values of 12 months minus those of pre-intervention values) had a negative r value (r = −0.134, p = 0.322) with the changes in mono-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI)s (12 months–pre-intervention) (Figure 3a).",bbd08368-f531-4cc3-9106-509c90b67ab5

Our previous studies in which the effects of spermine (SPM) on LFA-1 expressions were examined showed that spermine (SPM) supplementation-induced decreases in LFA-1 expressions of cultured cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were observed very gradually [13]. Therefore, changes of blood polyamine concentrations and spermine (SPM)/Spermidine (SPD) ratio at 8 months were compared with the changes of LFA-1 after 12 months of intervention.",723ae99a-070e-4806-bd28-6e805e1ab0d7
20,methods21," The changes in blood spermine (SPM) concentrations after 8 months of intervention (changes of values at 8 months from those of pre-intervention) had a negative r value (r = −0.176, p = 0.191) with the changes in mono-CD11aMean fluorescent intensities (MFI)s (12 months–pre-intervention).

Discussion  The activities of enzymes involved in polyamine synthesis decrease with age. However, the aging-associated declines in polyamine concentrations were observed only during early life. Nishimura et al.",3424eeb5-c7b2-4194-8f5d-0f59b73fdcec
21,methods22," found that polyamine concentrations in various tissues and organs were significantly lower in 10- and 26-week-old mice than in 3-week old mice, but no differences in Spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPM) concentrations were observed between 10- and 26-week-old mice, except in the skin [22]. Similarly, as observed in this study, no age-associated declines have been observed in blood polyamine concentrations and in urine polyamine excretion in adult humans [13,23,24,25]. A large inter-individual differences in blood Spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPM) concentrations observed in the study have also been reported in previous studies [13,23], although exact biological mechanisms underlying the inter-individual differences are unknown.  The results of a previous study indicated that cells in which spermine (SPM) suppressed LFA-1 expression differed from those with increased LFA-1 with aging [13].",a5a24e10-6de7-428c-8a51-de87a6d04f1e
22,methods23," This study showed that aging-associated increases and spermine (SPM) concentration-dependent decrease in LFA-1 protein levels occur in different cell populations. In this study, we isolated PBMCs immediately after blood sampling, which reduced the time for PBMCs to contact the plastic wall of the blood collection tube. Cell-to-wall contact stimulates PBMCs, and however weak this stimulation is, it enhances LFA-1 expression and adhesion capacity via the production of a small amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such interactions augment the effects of spermine (SPM) on LFA-1 expression on all immune cells because polyamine (especially spermine (SPM)) inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis [14]. Rapid isolation enabled us to reveal that aging-associated increases in LFA-1 protein levels were observed in the lymphocyte area, while the effect of spermine (SPM) on LFA-1 was obvious in the monocyte area.",a135c2bb-8b6c-4ebf-9be4-5f73ab2c2c86
23,methods24,"  The weakness of the study is that the study was not conducted in an intervention assignment or by randomization. Natto is a traditional Japanese food with a peculiar odor. Like other food preferences of this kind, preferences are roughly different from person to person. Therefore, we considered that one-year natto intake is not possible when volunteers who do not like natto were assigned in the study group, and there must be a large number of dropout cases. As a result, no one in the study group dropped out, and the study first revealed the effects of long-term increased polyamine intake in humans. Estimated average intakes of Spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPM) from foods in the Japanese population are 36 and 74 µmol/day, respectively [10]. In this study, increases in Spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPM) intakes from polyamine-rich natto were comparable to the daily Spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPM) intakes by the average Japanese person.",f38352c0-9faf-4277-bee6-cde8e03acfcd
24,methods25," Natto contains 4 to 5 times more Spermidine (SPD) than spermine (SPM), but blood Spermidine (SPD) levels did not increase. The exact mechanisms through which increased polyamine intake predominantly elevates blood spermine (SPM) levels are unclear, but our animal experiments showed similar results: polyamine-rich chow containing 1540 nmol/g of Spermidine (SPD) and 374 nmol/g of spermine (SPM)e also predominantly elevated blood spermine (SPM) in mice [18,26]. Blood Spermidine (SPD) increased in a few mice, but without statistical significance.  The relationship between increases in polyamine intake and those in blood spermine (SPM) levels seems not to be simply additive. Differences in increases of blood spermine (SPM) in response to increased polyamine intake were also observed in animal experiments, despite all mice being born and bred in the same environment and fed the same chow [17,18].",4c8ca801-8574-4374-8cb9-87ae9267c0a6
25,methods26," Extracellular polyamine supply has a significant effect on intracellular polyamine concentrations, a phenomenon that is typically seen in patients with cancer. Polyamine biosynthesis is up-regulated in cancer cells, and therefore Spermidine (SPD) concentrations, which reflect the activity of cell growth, are increased in the blood and urine in patients with cancer. These facts indicate that spermine (SPM) supply is increased by increased polyamine intake. There are two sources of polyamines in the intestinal lumen: those in ingested foods and those synthesized by microbes. Recent studies indicate the importance of the composition of the intestinal microbiota for synthesis of intestinal polyamines [27]. Matsumoto et al. reported that probiotics administration increased spermine (SPM), but not Spermidine (SPD), concentrations in feces in humans and animals, although probiotics and intestinal microbiota by themselves cannot synthesize spermine (SPM) [28,29].",b56e1aa8-11c4-41cb-91b1-79b2635e3ad5
26,methods27," The different responses to increased polyamine intake may reflect differences in the intestinal environment, and especially in the composition of the intestinal microbiota.  Both Spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPM) have superficially similar biological activities. However, experiments using PBMCs and cultured immune cells have shown that spermine (SPM) has greater potency for decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis and LFA-1 expression, compared to Spermidine (SPD). spermine (SPM) has potent effects when intracellular concentrations are increased about 1.2 to 1.3 times, while Spermidine (SPD) only has similar activities at intracellular concentration increases of 2 to 3 times [13]. In this study, increased polyamine intake increased mean spermine (SPM) levels by more than 1.1 times, but did not increase Spermidine (SPD), which suggests that biological effects induced by increased polyamine intake are mainly ascribable to spermine (SPM).",a74c493a-6250-44c1-bfd3-5af899bce817
27,methods28,"  LFA-1 protein level is not only regulated by ITGAL (LFA-1 promoter) methylation but also controlled by an intracellular signaling pathway [30], and inflammation typically increase LFA-1 levels. Therefore, volunteers who had acute inflammatory conditions at the time of blood sampling were eliminated based on exponential changes of hs-CRP that reflect acute inflammation. This elimination resulted in the effects of spermine (SPM) on LFA-1 expressions becoming significant in subjects. Furthermore, the inverse correlations between the changes in LFA-1 expression and the changes in spermine (SPM) concentrations or the changes in spermine (SPM)/Spermidine (SPD) ratio were further confirmed, even when the analyses were performed ignoring the effects of inflammation (Figure 3).",64d9d495-b135-40cb-9c44-4fefa00c05da
28,methods29," These findings are similar to those in our animal experiments, in which increased blood spermine (SPM) levels by increased polyamine intake accompanied by inhibition of aging-associated increases in LFA-1 protein levels and inhibition of enhanced aberrant methylation of the entire genome [17].  Global alterations in DNA methylation status associated with age have been documented in many vertebrate tissues [31,32], and such changes are considered a major cause of age-associated chronic diseases and fragility [33,34,35]. Aging-associated or polyamine depletion-induced enhancement of aberrant methylation of the entire genome is associated with increased demethylation of the LFA-1 promoter and increased LFA-1 protein levels. In contrast, decreased LFA-1 expression induced by spermine (SPM) was associated with increased LFA-1 promoter methylation and inhibition of aberrant methylation [19].",54f86c50-3188-4363-a738-5d4f6428e4fe
29,methods30," These indicate that the suppression of LFA-1 by increased polyamine intake is associated with suppression of aberrant methylation of the entire genome.  5. Conclusions  Increased polyamine (spermidine and spermine) intake by natto elevated blood spermine levels and inhibited pro-inflammatory status.
