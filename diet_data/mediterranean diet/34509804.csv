0,methods0," Participants  The present study included adults aged 20–80 years, who completed the baseline visit for the Reference Ability Neural Network (Reference Ability Neural Network (RANN)) study (N = 425)32. For the current analyses, participants were excluded if they did not have diet questionnaire data (108); of the 317 remaining participants, 22 were excluded due to missing rsFC data. Of the 295 remaining participants with diet and rsFC data, 87 were excluded due to missing structural data, and a further 7 were excluded due to missing in-scanner cognitive tests, resulting in a final sample size of N = 201.  All participants were native English speakers, right-handed, free of MRI contraindications, and read at a fourth-grade level or above. No participants had any psychological or medical conditions that could affect cognitive function, and no older adults met criteria for dementia or MCI.",ea705165-f9f9-46fa-af0d-38fa299a9d91

All participants provided informed consent, and all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of the institution and with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.  Dietary assessment  Habitual dietary information in the past year was self-reported using a 61-item version of Willett’s semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)33. Frequency of consumption in servings per month was calculated for each of 11 food categories and assigned frequency categories ranging from 0 to 5. For beneficial components (non-refined cereals, potatoes, fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, olive oil), increasing scores corresponded to increased intake; detrimental components (poultry, red meat, full fat dairy products, alcohol) were reverse-scored such that increasing scores corresponded to decreasing frequency.",12c01dac-57ee-408b-824b-ea9888122b35
2,methods2," Total MeDi score was calculated by adding scores in food categories (0–55), with higher score indicating higher adherence. MeDi scores were categorized into three groups (low, moderate, high) based on tertiles of total scores. Intake frequency scores were also summed separately for beneficial and detrimental food groups.  Cognitive function  Cognitive abilities were measured using 12 in-scanner tasks designed to assess performance on four latent variables, or reference abilities (RAs): perceptual speed, fluid reasoning, episodic memory, and vocabulary32. Perceptual speed (speed (SPEED)) was measured using a digit symbol task, letter comparison task, and pattern comparison task. Fluid reasoning (Fluid reasoning (FLUID)) was measured using a paper folding task, a matrix reasoning task, and a letter set task. Episodic memory (MEMORY) was tested using a logical memory task, a word order task, and a paired associates task.",bb23b252-e3bf-4d7b-9ea4-c88c489fbbfb
3,methods3," Vocabulary (Vocabulary (VOCAB)) was measured using an antonym task, a synonym task, and a picture naming task. (For more detail on task parameters, please see32.  Performance on each task was z-scored relative to the mean and standard deviation in participants of the entire Reference Ability Neural Network (RANN) study. Z-scores for tasks within each cognitive domain were then averaged to produce four reference ability z-scores for each participant.  MRI procedures and rsFC assessment  MR images were acquired on a 3 T Philips Achieva Magnet during two study visits lasting approximately 2-h each. Participants underwent 5 min (n = 62) or 9.5 min (n = 129) of fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)) resting state scans.

White matter hyperintensity burden (White matter hyperintensity burden (WMH)) was derived from fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging using the Lesion Segmentation Toolbox for Statistical Parametric Mapping, and White matter hyperintensity burden (WMH) volumes were log transformed prior to analysis. Mean cortical thickness and total brain volume were obtained using T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) scans, and standard FreeSurfer parcellation schemes were used to calculate mean thickness and volume based on 68 cortical regions of interest36.  For connectivity analyses, 264 ROIs defined by Power et al.37 were transferred to native space via non-linear registration of each subject’s structural scan to MNI template using ANTS software package.",a4a90fb5-aaa6-4900-a323-2a3150a052bf
6,methods6," A 10 mm radius spherical mask was generated for each coordinate and intersected with the FreeSurfer gray matter mask in order to derive the gray matter-registered ROI masks for each of the 264 ROIs. An intermodal, intra-subject, rigid-body registration of the fMRI reference image and T1 scan was then performed using FLIRT with 6 degrees of freedom, normalized mutual information as the cost function38, in order to transfer ROI masks from T1 space to fMRI space. These transferred ROI masks were used to average all voxels within each mask to obtain a single fMRI time-series for each of the 264 ROIs. Time-series data from each ROI were used to generate correlation matrices among all ROIs (264 × 264 ROIs) and were then z-transformed to generate normalized correlation matrices for each participant.

Although it is possible to include negative correlations in network analyses, there is considerable ambiguity in interpretation of negative correlations39,40. Therefore, only positive correlations in each participant’s correlation matrices were included in current analyses41.  ROIs were labeled based on the Power et al. network assignments37, with the following 10 networks being selected for analysis: Somatomotor Hand (Hand; 30 ROIs), Visual (Vis; 31 ROIs), Somatomotor Mouth (Mouth; 5 ROIs), Auditory (Aud; 13 ROIs), Default Mode (DMN; 58 ROIs), Salience (Sal; 18 ROIs), Cingulo-Opercular (CO; 14 ROIs), Frontoparietal (FP; 25 ROIs), Dorsal Attention (DAN; 11 ROIs), and Ventral Attention (VAN; 9 ROIs).",2b9ff07c-54bf-4412-8800-4a370d17c32b

Exploratory network-based analyses then examined network-based internetwork connectivity, or the mean correlation between ROIs in each network and ROIs in the nine other networks, in order to probe network-specific effects (10 values reflecting mean internetwork connectivity from each of the 10 networks to all others).  Data analyses  Descriptive statistics were used to present participant characteristics including age, education, gender, race, ethnicity, and IQ scores.

Given evidence that functional network connectivity is dependent on underlying structure of white matter tracts43, we also adjusted for potential confounding effects of total White matter hyperintensity burden (WMH) and mean FA.  In supplementary analyses, we performed post-hoc analyses by using the network-level measures of internetwork connectivity. Significant results were further probed by analyzing connectivity between pairs of individual networks. Additional exploratory analyses were conducted to test whether the moderating effect of MeDi on the association between rsFC and cognition was driven by adherence to beneficial foods or avoidance of detrimental foods.",334b3284-a7c9-424d-87d8-a2350f760bf2

Primary analyses were also conducted excluding participants with scrub percentage greater than 30 (N = 4); results did not differ from those using the full sample (data not shown).

Analyses of rsFC between all pairs of networks showed that MeDi group only significantly moderated the relationship between DMN-FP connectivity and Fluid reasoning (FLUID): compared to the low MeDi group, the effect of DMN-FP connectivity on performance was less negative for the moderate MeDi group (p-interaction = 0.023) and the high MeDi group (p-interaction = 0.003).

Nevertheless, for all networks, the interaction effects between detrimental food scores and rsFC on Fluid reasoning (FLUID) seemed to be consistently stronger than the interaction between beneficial food scores and rsFC (Table 4), suggesting avoidance of detrimental food groups may drive the moderating effects of MeDi observed in the primary analyses.Table 4 Interactions between effects of MeDi food type (beneficial, detrimental) and rsFC on fluid reasoning performance.",ad2e3201-701c-4ee8-98cc-521cf4fb9f46

More specifically, the reduced association between rsFC and MEMORY with increasing MeDi score was less prominent with increasing age. That is, in older subjects, MeDi can mitigate the negative effect of de-differentiation on RA to a lesser extent than in younger adults.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to test the relationship among MeDi, functional connectivity, and cognitive performance, and demonstrate that MeDi may benefit cognition by mitigating the negative effect of increased internetwork connectivity on cognitive function.  Of the four reference abilities tested, MeDi had the most robust effect on the relationship between internetwork rsFC and fluid reasoning.",bf970ca5-af43-416d-a168-831555c94a63
20,discussion1," This is consistent with past research from our group demonstrating that during fluid reasoning tasks, performance was significantly correlated with connectivity between multiple networks, whereas vocabulary, speed, and memory domains showed relatively fewer correlations with internetwork connectivity18. Other researchers have reported similar findings, with fluid reasoning tasks being associated with functional connectivity in attention, decision-making, sensorimotor, visual, and default mode networks44. Given that fluid reasoning is thought to be a core aspect of fluid intelligence, and relies on complex integration of multiple higher-order cognitive processes, it is therefore likely that engagement in these tasks recruits multiple large-scale brain networks.",02a223e3-688e-4d80-b02e-1df6789a42b7
21,discussion2," Although MeDi did not significantly moderate the effect of overall rsFC on any of the other reference abilities, it is worth noting that there was a marginally significant difference between the effect of overall rsFC on Vocabulary (VOCAB) in the high MeDi group relative to low MeDi group. However, because vocabulary performance tends to significantly improve with age, these results are less clearly interpretable, as any trends could be driven by effects of age on both vocabulary performance and on rsFC.  Our findings could potentially be interpreted in the context of cognitive reserve (CR), the properties of the brain that allow for better than expected cognitive performance given the degree of injury- or age-related changes to the brain45. The present study suggests MeDi may contribute to CR by buffering against potential negative effects of increased internetwork rsFC on cognitive function.",af126673-cd03-4ce0-9265-c8063f617132
22,discussion3," Nevertheless, rsFC has previously been considered a biomarker of CR, as connectivity serves as the differentiating factor in the association between structural brain measures and cognition46. For instance, recent work from our group identified a resting state connectivity pattern which moderated the relationship between cortical thickness and cognitive performance46, and which is significantly correlated with IQ, a common proxy for CR. In the current study, we did not find MeDi to be directly associated with rsFC; however, its role in moderating the effects of rsFC on cognition suggest MeDi may exert CR at a more downstream point, such that it impacts task-related neural mechanisms over and above those predicted by rsFC.  The biological mechanisms by which MeDi contributes to neurocognitive health remain unclear, but past research has suggested components of MeDi may alter cytokine activity and cell apoptotic pathways to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress47.",c549736a-296a-4160-85f9-19feff358bec
23,discussion4," Adherence to MeDi has also been positively associated with telomere length, a biomarker of aging that is predictive of neurodegenerative disease48. Past research has further suggested MeDi may lower risk of cognitive decline by protecting against multiple chronic diseases that are associated with cognitive impairment, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes49. Results of our exploratory analyses suggest avoidance of detrimental foods, including those known to be associated with increased risk for the above chronic illnesses, may underlie the moderating effect of MeDi on the relationship between rsFC and cognition. Therefore, it is plausible that MeDi has an indirect effect on neurocognitive health, whereby it protects against other diseases that may have detrimental effects on neural and cognitive function.",42bbbf18-0297-49b7-abe4-63afa64fec08
24,discussion5," However, the majority of existing research has focused only on the effects of beneficial nutrients on neurocognitive outcomes, and further research is needed to understand the respective roles of beneficial and detrimental foods on neural and cognitive function. In addition to understanding the impact of type and amount of food ingested, it may be beneficial to also consider the effect of eating schedules on cognitive and brain health. Indeed, there is a growing body of research suggesting intermittent fasting and caloric restriction may have benefits for neurocognitive health, including possibly protecting against neuropathological damage by reducing oxidative stress and supporting synaptic plasticity50–52. As such, future research would further benefit from not only examining the types of foods, but also the regularity of food intake, on neural and cognitive function.",29f95093-604a-42cc-ad19-7f4724092a99
25,discussion6,"  To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of dietary patterns on rsFC, and to evaluate the moderating effect of MeDi on the relationship between rsFC and cognitive performance. Furthermore, by controlling for the potential confounding effects of structural brain measures and participant characteristics, we were able to demonstrate the direct role of diet, irrespective of other factors known to impact rsFC and cognitive function. The current study is further strengthened by the inclusion of both younger and older adults, as opposed to much of the existing literature exploring the role of MeDi and cognition in only middle-aged or older adults.",374a4c08-f13e-42d1-ae33-4a3355d4c68c
26,discussion7," Although our primary analyses controlled for potential effects of age, exploratory analyses showed that increased age reduced the protective effect of MeDi only in the memory domain, and in two rsFC networks, suggesting the effects of MeDi on the relationship between other rsFC networks and cognitive functions may be present across the adult lifespan.  The limited past research on the effects of diet on brain biomarkers has largely focused on individual nutrients, and has produced inconsistent results, likely because typical diets contain combinations of nutrients that are highly correlated within food items, and which may interact in their effects on neurological and cognitive outcomes3,53. The current study, in contrast, is strengthened by the use of a MeDi score that captures intake of multiple food types, which reflects a more comprehensive measure of overall dietary patterns that may be associated with neurocognitive health.",cc0fe615-e5cf-4dff-94dd-24f2c9fe3612
27,discussion8," The study is further strengthened by the analyses of beneficial compared to detrimental food groups that contribute to the MeDi score, the results of which suggest avoidance of detrimental foods may play a stronger role than consumption of beneficial foods in supporting neurocognitive function. However, it should be noted that even within detrimental and beneficial food groups, there are multiple ways to reach a high MeDi score depending on specific foods consumed and, as such, future research should explore which combinations of food types best predict differences in the association between rsFC and cognitive function. Moreover, past research has typically focused on effects of acute or short-term consumption of dietary nutrients, which do not address the potential cumulative effects of prolonged intake of dietary factors.",7904ee52-ca51-46b9-bfae-32f9e0886a88
28,discussion9," The current study is strengthened by the use of habitual intake of food types, which significantly contributes to our understanding of how long-term dietary patterns impact neurocognitive function.  One limitation of the current study is the use of a cross-sectional design, which did not allow us to assess the longitudinal relationship between diet, connectivity, and cognition. As such, we are unable to draw conclusions about the benefits of MeDi over time, particularly in the face of age-related changes in neural and cognitive function. Although results of our sensitivity analyses suggested the protective effects MeDi did not differ as a function of age, further longitudinal research is needed to thoroughly understand the effects of MeDi on neurocognitive function throughout the lifespan.",3f7d3f02-5459-4475-b48e-de06f4334723
29,discussion10," Furthermore, because the current study is the first to test the relationships between rsFC, cognition, and diet, and has a relatively limited sample size to power complex interaction models, we set a somewhat liberal significance threshold for interpreting interaction effects. Although a lower significance threshold could increase the chance of Type I errors, the associated effect sizes and confidence intervals demonstrate reasonably robust interaction effects, and warrant replication using larger sample sizes.  We used in-scanner cognitive tasks to assess each of the RAs, as they were administered in the same session as rsFC data were collected, and could thus provide an optimal association between rsFC and cognitive performance.",951638de-ce0c-4162-b8a0-cb0f14c7e79e
30,discussion11," Nevertheless, a measure of RA that incorporates both in-scanner tasks and out-of-scanner neuropsychological tests may provide a more comprehensive measure of RA, and future research would benefit from evaluating whether the relationships between cognitive abilities, rsFC, and diet differ with the types of cognitive tests used.  Another potential limitation of the current study is the use of an externally derived network parcellation scheme, rather than basing network assignments on study participants’ network structures. However, given the wide age range of participants in the current sample, the use of an external parcellation scheme was optimal to avoid age-related biases in network assignment. Moreover, previous research has successfully utilized the current parcellation scheme to test relationships between functional connectivity and cognition18,22,54, and the use of an externally-derived taxonomy allows for more accurate reproducibility of our results in other samples.",300c8d81-85ff-4db9-b252-1f0fa5fb9875
31,discussion12," Nevertheless, future research may benefit from deriving functional networks based on study participants and investigate whether MeDi moderates the strength of these networks’ association with cognitive outcomes, to understand the role of network taxonomy more fully in the relationship between rsFC, diet, and cognitive function.  Lastly, we focused on internetwork rsFC, rather than examining rsFC within specific networks, based on existing research from our group and others’ suggesting connectivity between networks may be more predictive of changes in cognitive function, whereas the effects of intranetwork connectivity on performance are more variable, with the direction of associations with cognition depending on which specific networks and cognitive domains are assessed18,41,55–57. Further research examining intranetwork rsFC is warranted to understand the potential effects of lifestyle factors on specific networks and their effects on distinct cognitive functions.",ce4cc965-e4b0-434c-974e-79cd38a2d6bc
32,discussion13,"  Conclusions  Results of the current study suggest that MeDi may support cognitive function despite changes in brain connectivity, as evidenced by an attenuated negative effect of internetwork connectivity on cognitive function in those with higher MeDi adherence. Future research is warranted to understand how MeDi impacts structural and functional brain biomarkers and cognitive function over time, and to understand which precise patterns of nutrient intake may provide optimal protection against neurocognitive decline.
