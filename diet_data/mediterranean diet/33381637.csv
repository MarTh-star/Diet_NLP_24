1,methods0," A total of 235 individuals were included in the study. MD adherence and PA level were registered through validated questionnaires, together with a full periodontal examination. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) [95% confidence interval] were calculated to evaluate the association between MD adherence, PA level, and periodontitis severity. A final logistic multivariate regression model was built to evaluate the impact of the combination between low MD adherence and low PA level on the prevalence of Stage III/IV periodontitis.    2.1 Study design  The present study is reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)) guidelines for cross‐sectional studies. 22 The research protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (protocol number: 18993/2021) and received the registration number on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04771949).  2.",9fcb4c38-c19e-4bd8-83c7-035f178e9640
2,methods1,"2 Setting and participants  All consecutive patients attending the Unit of Periodontology at the University of Siena were screened between January 2021 and August 2021; the inclusion criteria were: ‐ age between 18 and 70 years old;  ‐ ability and willingness to give informed consent.  The exclusion criteria were:  ‐ pregnancy or lactation;  ‐ periodontal therapy performed in the last 12 months;  ‐ administration of antibiotics within the last 6 months;  ‐ inability to communicate effectively in Italian.  Individuals were included in the study after they read and signed the written informed consent, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  2.3 Variables  2.3.1 Sociodemographic characteristics  Information regarding patients' age, sex, smoking and oral hygiene habits, occupation and education level was registered.

The assessment methods of socio‐demographic characteristics are reported in the Supplementary Appendix in the online Journal of Periodontology.  2.3.2 Dietary assessment  A validated 15‐item questionnaire to measure patients’ adherence to MD (QueMD) was administered by two examiners (C.M., J.T.), following the structured questions and explanations provided by the questionnaire. 23 The questionnaire included questions regarding the foods most frequently associated with MD (wholegrain pasta, bread or substitutes; raw or cooked vegetables; all types of fresh fruits; dairies; either red or white wine; olive oil; red meat; fish; dried fruits; and pulses), as well as other commonly consumed items (white meat, carbonated beverages or soft drinks; butter, cooking cream or margarine; manufactured sweets, or pastries) (see Supplementary Table S1 in online Journal of Periodontology).",85146df4-f87c-4ce6-8ec6-01862b4afbb5
4,methods3," For each component, a standard portion for the Italian population was indicated 24 and participants could choose among five consumption frequencies, which differed according to food items. The alternate MD score (aMed) was drawn from the QueMD results in order to evaluate patients’ adherence to MD 23 ; it was calculated by assigning 1 point to participants reporting food consumptions above the Italian National levels 25 for each of the following items typical of the MD: wholegrain products (≥1/d), vegetables (≥2/d), fresh fruits (≥2/d), olive oil (≥3/d), wine (1 to 2 glasses/d for males or 1 glass/d for females), red meat (≤1 to 3/wk), fish (≥2/wk), dried fruits (≥2/wk), pulses (≥2/d). 13 The sum score ranged between 0 (minimum MD adherence) and 9 (maximum MD adherence); it was dichotomized in order to define cases of low (aMed <5) and high (aMed >4) adherence to MD considering its median in the current study population as the cut‐off value.  2.3.",36d2ba6f-0b9d-4ec0-aabc-90978fa2fc37

21,results26,"] ==== Body pmc1 INTRODUCTION  Periodontitis is defined as a biofilm‐mediated non‐communicable chronic inflammatory disease (non‐communicable chronic inflammatory disease (NCD)) characterized by the progressive destruction of the tooth supporting apparatus. Periodontitis is a highly common chronic inflammatory non‐communicable chronic inflammatory disease (NCD), with a prevalence of its severe form between 7% and 11%; 1 it represents the sixth most prevalent condition worldwide. 1 Further, periodontitis is associated with a range of systemic diseases, including diabetes, 2 cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), 3 and adverse pregnancy outcomes. 3 Several factors, such as overweight, smoking, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity, 4 are associated with disease occurrence and are shared as risk indicators with other prevalent non‐communicable chronic inflammatory disease (NCD)s, such as type‐2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).",dfd8c2d0-b572-4aec-b8af-7c9d65a904fc
22,results27,"  Indeed, periodontitis exerts a detrimental impact on both masticatory function and general health, thus resulting in higher dental healthcare costs. 5 Consequently, a lot of research 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 focused on the treatment of non‐communicable chronic inflammatory disease (NCD)s through a multifactorial approach targeted at improving various aspects of the patient's lifestyle, such as smoking, diet or physical activity (PA). In particular, the pioneer Seven Countries study in the 1950s was the first one to highlight the benefic effects of the Mediterranean diet (MD) 10 ; since then, epidemiological evidence flourished regarding the ability of MD to significantly reduce the risk of developing non‐communicable chronic inflammatory disease (NCD)s such as metabolic syndrome, T2DM, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancers.",e24e4239-439d-4f5c-875e-5fee368a71ee
23,results28," 11 , 12 The latest consensus on the Mediterranean pyramid 13 encompassed not only the consumption and serving size of specific food groups, but also other lifestyle dimensions (i.e., regular exercise and adequate rest) which, collectively, were framed in the “Mediterranean lifestyle” (ML). 13  While on the one hand a lot of studies focused on the effects of each single item of the ML (e.g., PA or nutrition), 9 , 14 , 15 no data are present regarding the impact of the combination of ML components or ML as a whole on oral health. In particular, while there is accumulating evidence 16 , 17 , 18 regarding the anti‐inflammatory potential of MD, on the other hand no evidence is present regarding the synergistic/antagonistic impact of adherence to both MD and PA on periodontal health.",39415a09-4904-4329-9ffc-147b2724a45c
24,results29," The hypothesis that we would like to figure out with this current cross‐sectional design is that low MD adherence combined with a sedentary behavior would increase low‐grade systemic inflammation, lipid levels and oxidative stress, as well as decrease insulin sensitivity 19 , 20 , 21 ; as such, they would contribute to a more severe periodontitis phenotype. Therefore, the aim of the present cross‐sectional study was to evaluate the association between MD adherence and PA level with the biometric and inflammatory periodontal parameters of a University‐based cohort of individuals.  2 ",5b1b7c2b-5dcf-4fe3-9e0f-7120d2d66394
25,discussion0,"  4.1 Summary of findings  In the current study, the odds of Stage III/IV periodontitis were found to be double in subjects with low/moderate PA level compared to those with high PA level and almost 6 times higher in subjects with low MD adherence compared to those with high adherence. The final regression model demonstrated how the combination of poor MD adherence and PA level led to 10‐time increased odds of Stage III/IV periodontitis. Age, smoking and familiarity for periodontitis resulted as additional predictors for Stage III/IV periodontitis. Moreover, the significant mediating effect of body mass index (BMI) accounted for around 9% of the direct effect of the combination between MD and PA on the occurrence of Stage III/IV periodontitis.  4.2 Dietary and physical activity assessments  This is the first study formulating the hypothesis of a significant association between PA level and MD adherence with periodontitis severity.",5f86440a-bd75-4519-8e82-d8b0a4372308
26,discussion1," Overall, high values of physical inactivity were detected in the present cohort (71%), maybe due to the presence of comorbidities in around 20% of the included individuals. High PA levels were associated with lower prevalence of Stage III/IV periodontitis, consistently to recent metadata showing how physically active patients are 22% less likely to have periodontitis when compared to those physically inactive. 14  A linear relationship between decreasing values of aMed scores and the worsening of periodontal indices was also found, with around 70% of those with low MD adherence being affected by Stage III/IV periodontitis. Results from the present study are partially discordant from those of a previous report 9 in which no differences in the biometric periodontal indices were found between subjects with high MD adherence compared to those with low adherence.",0b2b87ea-754a-4d9f-a0d6-74cd600793c3
27,discussion2," This result may be due to the different target population investigated in both studies: while the former enrolled University students (mean age 20 years), participants from the current report were selected among those coming to a periodontal Unit of a public University Hospital in Italy (mean age 53 years). Consequently, the reported values of periodontitis prevalence widely differ (6.6% versus 85%).  Indeed, subjects with low MD adherence and low/moderate PA presented not only worse biometric and inflammatory parameters, but also a more frequent experience of tooth mobility and tooth loss for periodontitis, irrespective of domiciliary oral hygiene measures and plaque accumulation. Therefore, a reciprocal association between such environmental factors (MD and PA) and the periodontium can be speculated.",c663fb36-aa48-4c64-9d84-39c21260ce31
28,discussion3," Firstly, the clinical manifestations of severe periodontitis, such as advanced clinical attachment level (CAL), tooth loss and tooth mobility, hamper masticatory function up to a point that they can lead to dietary changes, characterized by a decrease in fibers, fruits and vegetable intake. 34 In turn from a biological standpoint, the consumption of a Western diet, rich in white flour and processed meats, as opposed to MD, induces a state of low‐grade inflammation, contributing to the development of many non‐communicable chronic inflammatory disease (NCD)s, including periodontitis. 35 Conversely, high MD adherence was demonstrated to be inversely related with Stage III/IV periodontitis, supposedly due to the synergistic anti‐inflammatory potential of the single MD components: wholegrain products demonstrated the strongest protective effect in the current study.",c88d0828-f39c-4edb-a26b-2d099eed4bde
29,discussion4," In fact, a diet rich in wholegrains was associated with lower systemic inflammatory markers, such as C‐reactive protein, and decreased insulin resistance. 36 , 37 The improved insulin sensitivity could positively influence periodontal health by lowering the production of glycation end‐products, reducing oxidative stress and, therefore, by decreasing cytokines release. From a microbiological standpoint, an increased MD adherence was found to lead to a significant decrease in the salivary concentration of microorganisms such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Treponema denticola 38 ; therefore, the increased consumption of MD components may induce a microbial shift in the saliva, hence contributing to the host defense immunomodulation.",f17418e1-5dd2-43e0-9dc2-cfd19b61d8ad
30,discussion5," 39  On the other hand, low MD adherence and, in particular, a low consumption of wholegrain products, increases the odds of Stage III/IV periodontitis by almost 8 times plausibly by decreasing insulin sensitivity and increasing low‐grade systemic inflammation. 40  The current study also hypothesized a positive synergistic effect of regular exercise, in conjunction with high MD adherence, on periodontal health. Even though the effects of MD are prominent when compared independently to those of PA, regular physical exercise was previously demonstrated to decrease the concentration of specific proinflammatory markers involved in the clinical manifestations of periodontitis. 41  4.",93c1e234-0209-46b9-9bec-eed777bf4162
31,discussion6,"3 Final multivariate regression model  The final regression model highlights the ability of the combination between low MD adherence and low PA to increase the odds of Stage III/IV periodontitis by 10 times; nonetheless, every time MD adherence is below the selected cut‐off, the OR increases irrespective of PA level. Patient's lifestyle, in terms of diet and PA, seems to retain higher odds than smoking for Stage III/IV periodontitis. It can be speculated that such result may be due to the significant mediating effect exerted by body mass index (BMI): indeed, low MD adherence and low PA level were previously correlated with higher body mass index (BMI) values, 42 which in turn can potentially increase the odds for Stage III/IV periodontitis.",0991e600-9d84-4404-86fb-0d1694d8cf08
32,discussion7," 43 Such results may be relevant to better understand the etiopathogenesis of periodontitis, but may also have critical implications from a therapeutical standpoint: Step 1 phase 44 of periodontal therapy could be implemented by applying a holistic approach based on common risk factors 45 not only for oral health, but also for other non‐communicable chronic inflammatory disease (NCD)s. Therefore, risk‐factor modification should encompass smoking cessation counseling and oral hygiene instructions on one side, but also the promotion of both regular exercise and MD adherence on the other. Thus, this holistic approach based on common risk‐factor modification could significantly ameliorate both the treatment efficacy and long‐term management of lifestyle‐related pathologies, and also result in reduced healthcare costs.  4.4 Strengths and limitations  This is the first study investigating the association between the combination of MD adherence and PA level and Stage III/IV periodontitis.",505efcea-3b51-4927-828c-d4e50b10d4ff
33,discussion8," Diet and PA assessments were carried out using reliable and validated tools for the selected sample. In fact, the 15‐item questionnaire used to evaluate MD adherence (QueMD) was the first one to be developed for the Italian population and validated against a Food Frequency Questionnaire. 23 Moreover, PA levels were drawn from the results of the Short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), whose reproducibility and validity for the Italian population were demonstrated. 26 Altogether, these factors significantly contribute to the internal validity of the study.  The current study presents some limitations. First of all, the cross‐sectional design does not allow for a longitudinal evaluation regarding the cause‐effect relationship between the exposure and the outcome, and therefore it can be used only to build a hypothesis. Indeed, this design does not allow also to properly investigate reverse causality (i.e.",8b605a9f-305d-4c6a-ba42-dfa63b884377
34,discussion9,", effect of periodontitis on nutrition capability and dietary changes); moreover, no molecular parameters supporting the biological plausibility of such association were registered. Secondly, due to the lack of studies regarding the combined effect of MD and PA on periodontal health, the sample size calculation was instead performed based on the prevalence of periodontitis; therefore, the potential lack of power could explain the absence of association for PA in the multivariate models. Third, the assessments of the exposure (i.e., administration of questionnaires) and the outcome (periodontal chart) were performed by the same examiners, who therefore were not blinded during outcome assessment. Furthermore, all participants lived in the urban or suburban areas near Siena (Italy), where the vast majority of adults are Caucasian; hence, any variability in the outcome related to ethnicity may not have been detected.",e07d66d2-eac9-494c-9bb2-d18596fae8ab
35,discussion10," Moreover, given that the study population was selected among patients coming to a public Unit of Periodontology, the risk of selection bias could not be ruled out. Overall, these factors may reduce the generalizability of the study.  5 ",1c9e5c9d-e7dc-40a6-8ab8-ff439063a1ae
36,conclusion0," The present study demonstrated that individuals conducting a lifestyle characterized by low adherence to MD are more than 9 times more likely to have severe manifestations of periodontitis, irrespective of PA level. Further research is needed to elucidate the periodontal response to the implementation of Step 1 phase of periodontal treatment with nutritional and PA counseling sessions.
