0,methods0," 2.1. Study Population  The present study population was extracted from subjects who participated in the bioMILD trial (clinicaltrials.gov ID:NCT02247453), an ongoing large prospective study of the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan, that enrolled a total of 4119 heavy smoking volunteers (i.e., (i) current or ex-smokers from less than 10 years, with ≥30 packs/years, aged 50–75 years and free from neoplasms within the previous five years, or (ii) current or ex-smokers from less than 10 years, with <30 packs/years, aged 50–75 years and free from neoplasms within the previous five years with additional risk factors such as family history of lung cancer, prior diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) or pneumonia, professional exposure to known carcinogens) from January 2013 to March 2016 to undergo Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) examination, spirometry, plasma and blood sample collection,",dd9eb3e2-6212-41f9-a8b1-c964c94d030b
1,methods1," and microRNA profiling.  More specifically, the present study is a secondary analysis of the main bioMILD trial. Out of 4119, we selected 3810 (93%) alive participants on May 2018 with an available e-mail address to collect information on dietary habits.  The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan (code: INT 0021/11) and performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. All the eligible patients signed an informed consent form before enrollment.  2.2. Subjects Data Collection  Available data from baseline bioMILD questionnaires and examinations included age, gender, smoking habits, educational level, body mass index (BMI), information on chronic diseases and drug consumption, and forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV1). All participants underwent pre-bronchodilator spirometry using a flow spirometer (KoKo; nSpire Health, Longmont, CO, USA) according to ATS/ERS criteria.  2.3.",69ebd563-46cc-4fed-8849-0c12e4df81d2
2,methods2," Blood Sample Collection and C reactive protein (CRP) Mark  Plasma was collected at baseline for each participant and C reactive protein (CRP) level was quantified by immunoturbidimetry using a Roche automated clinical chemistry analyzer (Cobas C 6000, Roche Diagnostics, Belleville, NJ, USA).  2.4. Lifestyle Questionnaires  The selected participants were invited by e-mail to fill out newly administered questionnaires including specific items on dietary habits. Four different types of questionnaires were sent to an equal number of subjects, randomly selected from the study population with similar epidemiologic characteristics. The four formats of the questionnaires were: (a) long radio buttons question type (select one single answer option in a list of alternatives) with 40 questions, (b) short radio buttons question type with 20 questions, (c) long free text question type with 40 questions, and (d) short free text question type with 20 questions.",e6f4ed43-c5cf-4b97-8339-0630222f8e5f
3,methods3,"  In particular, subjects were asked to indicate the average daily/weekly consumption or types of selected foods and food groups.  For the present analysis, we evaluated all information retrieved from the four types of questionnaires.  2.5. MedDiet Screener  The adherence to the MedDiet was measured by the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)), developed by PREvencion con DIeta MEDiterranea (PREDIMED) trial [32]. The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) consists of 14 questions on food intake habits, and each question is scored 0 or 1 to calculate a final Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score ranging from 0 to 14 (Table S1).",8100ef0d-ee70-4ea1-a62b-2cab95bb5c13
4,methods4," The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score was revised by adding up to 4 items available from the lifestyle questionnaires administered to the study population and not already included in the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score, related to foods that showed the major pro- or anti-inflammatory potential (Table S2). Questions on sugar, whole grain cereals, and orange vegetables/fruits are in all four different formats of the questionnaire and each item was scored 0 or 1. Each point was added to the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) to determine a 17-item revised-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). This score was calculated on the whole study population (2438 participants).",35fee4dc-42f8-468a-a724-92c0744b3633
5,methods5," The question on coffee consumption was only present in the two long-format questionnaires, and the assigned score 0 or 1 was combined with the previous 17-item revised-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) to calculate an 18-item revised-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), available only for subjects with the long-format questionnaire (1219).  2.6. Statistical Analysis  Outlier values of self-reported dietary information of the free text question type questionnaires were handled by a multiple imputation analysis using the fully conditional specification model for arbitrary missing patterns that assumes the existence of a joint distribution for all variables [49]. As a rule of thumb, the number of imputed datasets should be at least equal to the percentage of incomplete cases [50]. The questionnaires were compared on the basis of response and completion rate. The differences between strata were tested by Chi-squared tests with a significance level equal to 0.05.",cb8d6433-b1cc-4570-ad99-0f1c0b6ae56e
6,methods6,"  The C reactive protein (CRP) level was dichotomized into low (<2 mg/L) and high (≥2 mg/L) according to previous experience [22,23,24,25]. Regression coefficients and odds ratios (OR), with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values, for high versus low C reactive protein (CRP) levels were estimated using multivariate unconditional logistic regression models to evaluate the relationship between C reactive protein (CRP) levels and the original 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score and the two adapted versions of Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score with the related added items after adjusting for sex, age (continuous), pack-years (categorical, <30 and ≥30), smoking status, FEV1% (categorical, ≤90 and >90 [25]), chronic diseases, taking metformin (yes/no), taking a statin (yes/no), taking Acetylsalicylic acid (Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)) (yes/no), body mass index (BMI), and type of questionnaire completed.",05deb8c0-bf40-43c3-85fd-2fccc4c5739f
7,methods7," body mass index (BMI) was categorized into underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity according to the standard WHO categorization.  Multivariate unconditional logistic regression models for higher C reactive protein (CRP) levels according to body mass index (BMI) categories, after adjustment for the same covariates as above except for the type of questionnaire completed, and results were reported in Supplementary Materials.  Statistical analyses were carried out using Statistical Analysis System Software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).  3. Results  3.1. Study Sample  Of the 3810 questionnaires sent to bioMILD trial participants (i.e., 964 long radio buttons question type, 943 short radio buttons question type, 952 long free text question type, and 951 short free text question type), 2635 (69.2%) were returned and 2438 were complete (92.5% of returned and 64.0% of eligible).",c93a531a-97ab-445b-8135-84f60dcb344b
8,methods8," No difference was observed among the four types of questionnaires in terms of response rate (68.4% of long radio buttons question type, 68.5% of short radio buttons question type, 70.2% of long free text question type, and 69.6% of short free text question type, p = 0.796) and completion (93.2%, 93.5%, 90.6%, and 92.9% respectively, p = 0.164). Outlier values of reported food’s intakes of the free text question types were 1% of all answers.  The distribution of selected characteristics of the 2438 volunteers at baseline is described overall and stratified by questionnaire randomly assigned (Table 1). The median age of the study participants was 59 (IQR: 54–64); they were mainly men and current smokers, with median pack-years of 41 (IQR: 34–51). The 56% had an intermediate educational level (secondary school and vocational course). The median C reactive protein (CRP) level was 1.3 mg/L (IQR: 0.63–2.59), the median body mass index (BMI) was 25.4 kg/m2 (IQR: 22.86–27.",c3a429b9-5e85-4703-8cfd-d18df606bfc2
9,methods9,"92), and 35% of the selected population had a prior diagnosis of chronic diseases.  3.2. MedDiet Scores and C reactive protein (CRP)  The original 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score showed a statistically significant protective association with higher C reactive protein (CRP) level (Table 2). Adjusted regression coefficient β and OR for a 1-point score increment were respectively −0.05 and 0.95 (95%CI: 0.91–0.99, p= 0.0282). Results of adjusted logistic regression of revised-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores and their added items are shown in Table 2. The consumption of <2 tsp per day of sugar was inversely related to high C reactive protein (CRP) (β = −0.17, OR 0.85, 95%CI 0.71–1.01, p = 0.0635). Subjects who consumed whole grain cereals were more likely to have lower C reactive protein (CRP) levels (β = −0.18, OR 0.84, 95%CI 0.71–1.00, p = 0.0549).",886ec0f2-9934-43a6-bb79-070ccb57e7a9
10,methods10," More than 1 serving per week of orange vegetables and fruits was inversely related to higher C reactive protein (CRP) level (β = −0.20, OR 0.82, 95%CI 0.67–1.00, p = 0.0559). The three estimates are not statistically significant but on the limit of significance. 1-point increment of the 17-item revised-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score showed a statistically significant inverse association with higher C reactive protein (CRP) levels, with regression coefficient β and OR respectively −0.06 and 0.94 (95%CI: 0.91–0.98, p= 0.0033). Analysis only on long-format questionnaires showed that 2 or more servings per day of coffee had a protective effect on C reactive protein (CRP) levels (β = −0.48, OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.43–0.89, p = 0.0091). The 18-item revised-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) with its 1-point increment showed a statistically significant inverse association with C reactive protein (CRP) levels, β −0.08 and OR 0.92 (95%CI 0.87–0.97, p = 0.0022).",07b672a4-52c3-48c8-962c-122129e84554
11,methods11,"  Multivariate regression according to body mass index (BMI) levels showed that as body mass index (BMI) increased, the prevalence of high C reactive protein (CRP) levels was significantly higher (Table S3).  4. Discussion  In our population of Italian heavy smokers enrolled in an Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) screening trial (bioMILD), the adherence to MedDiet, measured by a score, was inversely related to C reactive protein (CRP) levels.  The effect of Mediterranean eating habits on C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations has been investigated in several studies. Most of them used long and complex food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (over 80 questions). We tested shorter formats of questionnaires as a simple and quick tool to guarantee the most possible compliance of our selected population, who completed the questionnaires online independently.",413867f1-30eb-449c-8f31-d4452a475fd2
12,methods12," Compared to the validated Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), a simple questionnaire of 14 items, we increased the number of questions by separating more items and investigating more food consumptions to overcome the declared limits of too few questions and to be able to improve it with further items [40]. Our questionnaires investigated the consumption of typical Mediterranean foods and other foods whose consumption is frequent in the Italian population (e.g., coffee) and/or which the literature indicates an anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory potential. We administered four different questionnaires, 20 or 40 questions and radio button or free text questions, to test which one guarantees greater compliance by the population and to test the most useful one to determine a more reliable score to investigate the food habits of the Italian population, which represents our target population.",57320553-c577-48c2-a639-7f6e9bc49a2e
13,methods13,"  The predictive utility of Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score was validated not only in the Spanish population but also in other countries (e.g., UK, USA, Germany) without modifications [51,52,53]. A local adaptation of Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) was made in the Israeli population, where a new I-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score was calculated from food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data to reflect national dietary recommendations in Israel [54].",3e393d45-1fc3-4787-8102-10dc27d96adf
14,methods14,"  We not only applied the original 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score, but we also improved it by including selected food items commonly used in the Italian diet that, according to literature, have shown a potential pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effect in multivariate regressions for high C reactive protein (CRP) versus low C reactive protein (CRP), adjusted for body mass index (BMI), which is directly related to C reactive protein (CRP) levels as our analysis in Supplementary Materials confirmed, and other covariates. We created a 17-item revised Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) by adding questions on sugar, whole grain cereals and orange vegetables and fruits. The Mediterranean diet is characterized by a high intake of complex carbohydrates in the form of whole grains, characterized by a low glycemic index where the sugar comes from the fruit alone. Whole grain cereals showed an anti-inflammatory effect [55].",22599939-ede3-4643-9d17-6b9f741acd00
15,methods15," Instead, an excess of sugar has been linked to inflammation [56]. The consumption of orange fruit and vegetables rich in carotenoids has been evaluated for their potential protective effect against lung cancer [1]. An 18-item revised Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score was created by adding a further question about coffee consumption, widely consumed by Italians, which showed to be protective against high C reactive protein (CRP) [57]. We observed an inverse association between the original 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score and C reactive protein (CRP), as previously shown in the Spanish population [40]. The statistically significant inverse association with C reactive protein (CRP) was also observed with a slightly greater significance for the two adapted scores, 17-item revised-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and 18-item revised-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), which investigated more dietary components.",a5c27dd9-edcc-47c1-9f3e-3c438688b51d
16,methods16," In the 18-item revised-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), calculated only on half of the population to which long-format questionnaires were assigned, the association with C reactive protein (CRP) retained the same significance as the 17-item revised-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), despite the smaller number of subjects.  Our findings suggested that an adapted MedDiet score, adding a few inflammation-related foods, was more effective to investigate the relationship between diet and C reactive protein (CRP) in our Italian heavy-smoking population.  Furthermore, there was no difference in the response rate between the four types of questionnaires used. A long free text question type with 40 questions appeared to be the preferable option, to refine the score with more questions and modified cut-offs of serving size while remaining a simple format.",7bd6b1d2-3918-44e5-bac0-4cee27d8269e
17,methods17,"  The main limitations of our study are those inherent to the cross-sectional design, including in particular the inability to derive causal inference. Strengths of the study include the large sample size and the availability of objective markers (i.e., C reactive protein (CRP)), which were determined in the same laboratory for all subjects.  Such evaluation has been instrumental to the design of a prospective randomized trial combining lung cancer screening with primary prevention: the SMILE trial. The SMILE study is an ongoing trial launched in 2019 at the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan, and it tests the feasibility and efficacy of multiple interventions, including targeted dietary modification and physical activity, in addition to smoking cessation with cytisine treatment, reduction of chronic inflammation by low-dose aspirin (Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)), and early diagnosis with Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT).",d949c05b-e3c3-4cd1-ae9e-70463c0fb612
18,methods18," Each randomized heavy smoker volunteer was assigned a personal account on the SMILE website (https://www.programmasmile.it, accessed on 10 August 2022), and every six months, all participants were invited to complete online free text format questionnaires on eating and lifestyle habits. The SMILE trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan and the Italian Medicines Agency (and the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA)). Positive results on smoking cessation therapy with cytisine at one year of follow-up have already been published [58]. Analysis of the efficacy of the nutritional intervention will be published at the end of 2 years of follow-up.  5. Conclusions  Our data showed a close inverse relationship between adherence to MedDiet and lower levels of C reactive protein (CRP) in a population of heavy smokers, including the efficacy of a simplified dietary score.",52ed0337-074d-45fd-b417-1b0d3a729aed
19,methods19," These results suggest that targeted interventions on dietary habits could modify C reactive protein (CRP) levels, and reduce the overall mortality risk of heavy smokers. An anti-inflammatory nutritional intervention could be offered as a standard activity in future Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) screening programs to strengthen screening efficacy.
