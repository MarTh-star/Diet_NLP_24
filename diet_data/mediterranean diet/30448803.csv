0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design and Participants We analyzed participants in the PREDIMED Plus-Valencia study [105]. The University of Valencia (located in the eastern Mediterranean coast), is one of the field centers of the multi-center PREDIMED Plus study, an ongoing primary prevention trial conducted in Spain [106]. A detailed description of the trial is available at http://predimedplus.com/. This trial was registered at https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN89898870. Participants in the Valencia field center were recruited from several primary care health facilities. These participants were community-dwelling adults (men, 55–75 years; women, 60–75 years) with body-mass index (body mass index (BMI)) ranging from 27 to 40 kg/m2 and having metabolic syndrome [106]. In this recruitment center, the total number of randomized participants included in the PREDIMED Plus trial was 465.",30af3cda-166e-425e-8045-98e47cdf2704
1,methods1," In the present work, we undertake the cross-sectional analyses of an ancillary project including all the participants in our center with complete data on serum polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations at baseline and genome-wide genotyping, in addition to the other variables for adjustments (n = 426). The analyzed subjects did not differ significantly from our entire sample concerning the main variables. The Institutional Review Board of the Valencia University approved the study protocol (ethical approval code H1373255532771), and all participants provided written informed consent.  2.2. Baseline Clinical, Anthropometric, Biochemical, and Lifestyle Variables In the baseline examination, we assessed socio-demographic variables, clinical and cardiovascular risk factors, and lifestyle variables by validated questionnaires as previously reported [106].",87085e3d-cbfe-4b8c-9223-e69605eb0a95
2,methods2," Anthropometric variables and blood pressure were determined by trained staff following the PREDIMED Plus operations protocol [107]. Weight and height were measured with calibrated scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer, respectively. body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared. Waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest, after normal exhalation, using an anthropometric tape. Blood pressure was measured with the use of a validated semiautomatic oscillometer (Omron HEM-705CP, Netherlands) while the participant was in a seated position for 5 min.  Blood samples were collected after a 12-h overnight fast. Fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride concentrations were measured as previously described [107].",c836270d-5bed-4e11-859d-255533c2f2b6
3,methods3," Leisure-time physical activity was assessed using the validated REGICOR questionnaire [108], including questions to collect information on the type of activity, frequency (number of days), duration, and total leisure-time physical activity-related energy expenditure was estimated. The dietary pattern was assessed by a 17-item score capturing adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet [109]. We have published the detailed version of this questionnaire as well as its association with quality of life and cardiovascular risk factors [109]. Briefly, traditional Mediterranean diet is characterized by a high intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish, as well as fat from vegetable sources, including nuts, and a low intake of red meat and desserts. In the 17-item screener, a suitable consumption of typical traditional Mediterranean foods adds one point and a low consumption of foods not characteristic of the Mediterranean diet also adds one point.",c7ef49da-3078-41e2-9b52-cce71c0dda52
4,methods4," A higher score means higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Supplemental Table S1 shows the 17 detailed items and the corresponding scores.  2.3. Serum Fatty Acid Determinations Serum was obtained from fasting blood samples as previously detailed [55]. Serum fatty acids were measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)) spectroscopy as previously reported in detail [110,111]. This high—throughput nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics platform (Nightingale Health Ltd., Helsinki, Finland), has been applied and validated in numerous studies [112,113]. The measurements of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with this nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform were only undertaken on participants recruited at the PREDIMED Plus-Valencia field center. Currently, there are no participants from other field centers with these data determined. In this study, we used all the available measurements of serum fatty acids provided by the platform.",4aa3fa5c-4cb3-42d8-aed3-6be10acbb24a
5,methods5," These included total fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)), saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)), total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). We also included LA and docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA) for being the two specific fatty acids that that platform reported separately. No additional polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were reported in this platform. The results for total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega-3, omega-6, and LA and docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA) are very robust and have been validated in many publications [110,111,112,113,114,115]. Although we focused our genetic analyses on polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), for descriptive reasons, saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and total fatty acids were also reported.",3ed56a60-63b0-40f0-81cc-7735cd0a4568
6,methods6," Serum fatty acids were measured as follows: After measuring the lipoprotein data from native serum samples, their lipids were extracted and another nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum measured (see reference [116] for details). In these lipid extracts, each fatty acid gives rise to a characteristic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) resonance, the area of which is associated with their concentration. After further scaling to account for slight experimental variation in lipid acquisitions in the extraction procedure [116], the different polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations were quantified in mmol/L, representing the true concentration in serum. Finally, serum fatty acids were expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids.",4b8b97a9-264e-4659-9f4d-b1950132f80d
7,methods7," Although both measures (absolute and relative) can be used [117], we have analyzed polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and percentage because in previous works, fatty acids have been commonly used as percentage of total, and we want to compare our results with those obtained in other populations.  2.4. Genome-Wide Genotyping We isolated genomic DNA from the buffy coat samples with the MagNaPure LC DNA Isolation kit (ROCHE Diagnostics). We measured the concentration and the quality of the isolated DNA by the PicoGreen instrument (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After DNA-quality control, high-density genotyping was performed in samples passing this control using the Infinium OmniExpress-24 v1.2 BeadChip genotyping array (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at the University of Valencia, Valencia. Genotyping was undertaken according to the manufacturer’s protocol with appropriate quality standards. The Infinium OmniExpress v1.2 BeadChip captures 713,599 markers.",7beb4f3a-3561-4ab3-a03d-9caa068eb751
8,methods8," Allele detection and genotype calling were performed in the Genome Studio genotyping module (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Data cleaning was performed using standard analysis pipelines implemented in the Python programing language using the Numpy library modules combined with PLINK [118,119]. From the initial full set of SNPs in the array, those not mapped on autosomal chromosomes were filtered out. In addition, SNPs with a minor allele frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF)) <0.01 or those that deviated from expected Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (p < 1.0 × 10−4) were removed. A total of 621,723 SNPs that passed the quality filter remained for further analysis.  2.5. Statistical Analysis Student t-tests and ANOVA tests were applied to compare crude means of continuous variables. Triglyceride and fatty acid concentrations (in mmol/L) were log-transformed for the statistical analyses.",5526bf94-923a-4e86-83d7-f6a8f4374cf7
9,methods9," Fatty acids, expressed as % (total fatty acid of interest to total fatty acids), reached a normal distribution, and were not log transformed. Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions. Finally, we analyzed the omega-6/omega-3 ratio and we log transformed this variable to achieve normality for statistical testing. We analyzed the associations using both crude models and adjusted multivariate regression models (general lineal models) including potential confounders.  For the genome wide association studies (GWAS), at the genome-wide level, we tested the association between all the SNPs in the array (excluding those indicated above according to the quality control issues) and serum concentrations (expressed as %) of the different polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). We fitted separate models for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA), omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), LA, and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).",dc288aee-416c-4002-82ef-785c772a4784
10,methods10," Statistical models were sequentially adjusted by sex, age, diabetes, and other covariates including body mass index (BMI), smoking, medications, physical activity, and adherence to Mediterranean diet (17-item score). Additional adjustment did not change the statistical level of significance. Therefore, for the sake of simplicity, and to compare our results with the previous genome wide association studies (GWAS) carried out in different populations [79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86], that were mainly adjusted for sex and age, unadjusted models (Model 1) and multivariate models sequentially adjusted for sex, age, and diabetes (Model 2), were presented in tables and figures. Additional adjustments were specifically presented when indicated. For the study of genome-wide interactions with selected factors, hierarchical statistical general linear models were fitted. These models include the main variables and the corresponding interaction terms.",32af7cae-fb4a-4a05-b08b-4bb1bb15db57
11,methods11," Gene*sex and gene*diet genome-wide interactions were analyzed. For the study of the interactions between the SNPs and adherence to Mediterranean diet, we categorized baseline adherence to the Mediterranean diet (17-item screening) into two groups based on the sample median (8 points), defining 2 groups as either “Low” adherence to Mediterranean diet (0–8 points), or “High” adherence to Mediterranean diet (9–17 points). This cut-off point has been previously used by our group in another genome-wide interaction study [105].  For genome wide association studies (GWAS), genetic association analyses were performed using PLINK v1.9 [118,119]. Additive genetic models (unadjusted and multivariate adjusted when indicated) were fitted using a genotype dosage (0, 1, or 2 copies of the variant allele). Regression coefficients for the minor allele were estimated. Likewise, determination coefficients (r2) were also estimated.",90e708fe-90ab-44eb-b065-2c7a1e2f720d
12,methods12," To test gene*sex and gene*diet interactions at the genome-wide level, we used the PLINK GxE tool and showed the statistical significance on the interaction terms, as well as the regression coefficients for each stratum. Stratified analyses of interest were additionally carried out when indicated. We used the conventional threshold of p < 5 × 10−8 for genome-wide statistical significance. Likewise, according to the conventional genome wide association studies (GWAS) rules, SNPs with p-values below 1 × 10−5 were also considered suggestive of genome-wide significance. As these thresholds are very conservative for a small sample size, in selected analyses, SNPs with p-values below 5 × 10−5 are also shown in the tables so that they may be compared with other studies that have analyzed similar associations and may be included in meta-analyses. SNPs were rank-ordered according to the minimum p-value in the genetic models.  We used R Qqman R library [120] and Haploview (version 4.",618a58d8-170e-40ec-8ac5-9585dc9d492c
13,methods13,"2) [121] to create Manhattan plots and to calculate linkage disequilibrium among the SNPs of interest. Quantile–quantile plot comparing the expected and observed p-values [121] was performed in the R-statistical environment.  In addition to the genome wide association studies (GWAS) approach, to explore potential associated loci (candidates based on previous knowledge) which might fail to be identified at the genome wide association studies (GWAS) level due to the strict threshold for the whole genome approach (p < 5 × 10−8 for genome-wide statistical significance), we carried out additional region wide (RWAS)s. In these analyses, we previously selected a candidate region of the genome containing the most relevant genes previously associated with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and analyzed the associations with all the SNPs present in the selected region.",50668c0b-bf2c-49d3-8e02-3b25777030c3
14,methods14," Two candidate regions were selected [4,94]: (A) the region in chromosome 11 containing the FASD1/FASD2/FASD3 cluster [94]; and (B) the region in chromosome 6 containing the ELOVL2 and ELOVL5 genes [4]. All the SNPs in the selected genes for each region, included in the Human OmniExpress array were analyzed for associations with the serum polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (omega-3, docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA), omega-6, LA, and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)). The corresponding genotype data were extracted by a Python script, created by the authors. For selecting the available SNPs in these genes, we used another Python script, also created by the authors. For this procedure, we first used the batch query resource SNP Report with URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?locusId, and provided the target gene-ID. The dbSNP-gene type file is used as input argument in the *.bat file for running the Python script.",e50be8b5-21fe-4008-a797-19903cc572e4
15,methods15," Finally, the Python script produces the corresponding PLINK-formatted couple *.ped and *.map files of genotypes for statistical testing. For the selected regions, we carried out unadjusted and multivariate adjusted analyses determining the serum polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), as previously detailed for the genome wide association studies (GWAS) approach. Models adjusted for sex, age, and diabetes were presented. We also used PLINK v.1.9 [118,119] for these models. As the regional exploration is a replication analysis and our sample size is small, we considered a two-tailed p-value <0.05 as statistically significant for the region wide (RWAS) associations.  3. Results 3.1. General Characteristics of the Population Table 1 presents the demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics of the study participants at baseline by sex. We analyzed 426 subjects, including 187 men and 239 women.",da38b1ac-b24a-4c23-a241-72a427caa5f8
16,methods16," These were all the subjects recruited and randomized in the Valencia field center having complete data of serum fatty acid determinations by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [110,111] and genome-wide genotyping available. These were individuals aged 65.1 ± 0.2 years, with metabolic syndrome. The average mean age of men and women was 64.0 ± 0.4 years and 66.0 ± 0.3 years (p < 0.001), respectively. body mass index (BMI) did not differ significantly in men and women. The women analyzed in this study were all post-menopausal women.  Table 1 also shows total fatty acid concentrations in serum determined in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), saturated fatty acids (SFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega-3, and omega-6. In addition to these total profiles, the platform also reported specific measures for LA and docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA).",54a10800-8af7-4807-8a05-280dc5ad6656
17,methods17," Fatty acid concentrations were expressed in mmol/L as well as in % (ratio of the corresponding fatty acid to the total fatty acids). We used polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) expressed as % for further statistical analyses.  Total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was 35.9 ± % of the total fatty acids and did not differ between men and women. Similar percentages of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (4.09% total; p = 0.182 for sex differences) and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (31.8% total; p = 0.723 for sex differences were detected in men and women). Likewise, the percentage of docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA) and LA did not differ per sex. We also calculated the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio (no units for the ratio). This ratio was 7.98 ± 0.07 for the whole population and no statistically significant differences were detected between men and women (p = 0.254).  In these subjects with metabolic syndrome, consumption of antihypertensive drugs was high (78.4%).",7d5008eb-de06-4ff9-a3e4-7c06bcb45152
18,methods18," Consumption of lipid-lowering drugs (64.3%), consisting of mainly statins, was also high. No significant differences by sex were detected regarding for antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, or antidiabetic medications. In addition to the main medications presented in Table 1, Supplemental Table S2 shows additional medications taken (self-reported) in this population. Consumption of vitamins and minerals was reported for 12% of the populations, with significant differences (p < 0.001) between men (5.9%) and women (16.7%). There were no participants taking fish oil supplements. These supplements mainly consisted of calcium, folic acid, vitamin D, and some multivitamins (currently we do not have detailed information about their composition).  Mean adherence to the Mediterranean diet was 8.1 ± 0.1 point in the 17-item score. No statistically significant differences were detected between men and women (p = 0.145).",98550703-77d8-498f-a4a8-44bd48816579
19,methods19," We defined 2 groups of adherence to the Mediterranean diet as either “Low” adherence (0–8 points), or “High” adherence (9–17 points). This cut-off point has been previously used by our group for genome-wide-diet interaction studies [105].  We next focused on the genes and SNPs associated with the serum polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations for all the 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) variables analyzed (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA), omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), LA, total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio), using both a genome wide association studies (GWAS)s approach and a region wide (RWAS)s approach as detailed in Methods.  3.2.",7cc408ad-8323-4e61-9c28-6b67c77b4a12
20,methods20," genome wide association studies (GWAS) for Serum Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (%) in this Population We analyzed the associations at the genome-wide level in the whole population among all the tested SNPs (after quality control filtering) in the Illumina Human OmniExpress array and the 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) determined. For omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), we obtained several very strong associations at the genome-wide statistical level of significance (p < 5 × 10−8), replicating previous findings in other populations. Figure 1 presents the corresponding Manhattan plot showing the p-value (−log10 p) of each SNP analyzed as well as indicating both thresholds for significance (the genome wide association studies (GWAS) p-value of significance and the p-value suggestive of significance; p < 5 × 10−5). Supplemental Figure S2 shows the corresponding Q–Q plot. The top-ranked SNP was the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1-rs174547 with p = 7.",b479dbe6-968f-4558-9950-505493ea3bfb

Table 2 presents more information of the top-ranked SNPs both in the crude (Model 1) and in the adjusted model for sex, age, and diabetes (Model 2). The variance explained by the hit SNP was high (13.4%) and this SNP remained as the top-ranked in the model adjusted for sex, age, and diabetes. Its minor allele frequency (MAF) was also relatively high (0.298) and the effect (regression coefficient beta was −0.366 in the adjusted model). As we fitted an additive model, it means that each minor allele (C-allele) was associated with a decrease of the % of serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Other SNPs in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1 and fatty acid desaturase (FADS)2 genes also reached the genome wide association studies (GWAS) level of significance even after adjustment for sex, age, and diabetes (fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1-rs174550, p = 5.",b14e31d6-1f6c-43ae-9c7f-1fca56c63938
22,methods23," The SNPs near the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1/fatty acid desaturase (FADS)2 locus, were also highly associated with the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1/FASD2 SNPs.   Figure 3 shows the LD (using r2) among the top-ranked SNPs. Apart from the MYRF-rs174532, and the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)2-rs2727270, the other SNPs were highly correlated among them and with the lead SNP (fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1-rs174547).  Figure 4 shows the means of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (%) depending on the top-ranked fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1-rs174547 polymorphism. In this Mediterranean population, the T allele was the major allele (this prevalence highly varies depending on the population studied). Minor allele carriers presented significantly lower serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations (TT: 4.29% ± 0.04; TC: 4.09% ± 0.05 and CC: 3.44% ± 0.1). This strong genetic association did not vary significantly even after multivariate association (p = 7.",5a0c9ac0-0bbc-4020-b27e-3165944ce03e

A previous genome wide association studies (GWAS) in the Framingham study also showed a slight effect of the dietary adjustments in the SNP-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) associations [122]. Additional adjustment of the model containing all of these variables for more medications (including drug for pain and fever, anti-platelet drugs, tranquilizers-sedative-hypnotics, and vitamins/minerals), did not substantially change the statistical significance of the association between the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1-rs174547 polymorphism and serum omega-3 concentrations (p = 2.90 × 10−13).",2451d5f7-59c3-459f-959b-b050255d9beb
24,methods25,"  In addition to the SNPs found at the genome-wide level of significance, we also detected several SNPs at the suggestive p-value of genome wide association studies (GWAS) significance (p < 5 × 10−5). Among these genes, we would like to highlight the signal at the AHI1 (Jouberin) gene, located on chromosome 6, close to the MYB (proto-oncogene, transcription factor) gene and the HBS1L (like translational GTPase) gene, both of which have previously been reported in the Framingham study as new genes associated with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [69]. However, no association signals at the genome wide association studies (GWAS) level, or at the suggestive p-value of genome wide association studies (GWAS) significance, were found for the ELOVL candidate genes on chromosome 6 for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in our Mediterranean population.",3f3ee095-5902-4df0-829f-628863915b29
25,methods26,"  We next explored gene*sex interaction in determining serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations at the genome-wide level and only found a statistically significant interaction at the genome-wide level of statistical significance between the rs17097464-intergenic at chromosome 12 and sex (p = 1.13 × 10−8). The minor allele frequency (MAF) for this SNP was 0.193. In addition to this hit, we found 7 other SNPs (rs11081343, rs1402508, rs8052428, rs4732314, rs897476, rs6499260, and rs11754354) reaching p-values < 1 × 10−5 for the interaction terms with sex. Future studies should investigate these loci in more detail.  In another exploratory analysis, we investigated gene* Mediterranean diet interactions in determining serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations. Two Mediterranean diet strata were considered (low and high adherence to Mediterranean diet). Figure 5 shows the Manhattan plot for these interactions.",d8bfcd33-2134-4fe9-89d1-2ee774e57a3d
26,methods27,"  13 SNPs in the ME1 (malic enzyme 1) gene significantly interacted (at p < 1 × 10−5) with adherence to Mediterranean diet with p-values ranging from 2.15 × 10−7 to 9.4 × 10−6 (see Supplemental Table S3 for the detailed SNPs, betas, minor allele frequency (MAF), genes, and p-values for the corresponding interaction terms). Supplemental Figure S3 shows the Q–Q plot for these interactions, indicating a good performance. The ME1 gene is located on chromosome 6 and it is a plausible candidate for gene-diet interactions, taking into account that this gene is involved in fatty acids synthesis in the liver [123,124] and its modulation by the dietary fat content has been reported [124,125]. Figure 6 shows the regional plot for the top-ranked SNPs, ME1-rs3798890 (p = 2.15 × 10−7) in the genome-wide interaction analysis with Mediterranean diet.",1ecf19c6-34a0-42f1-8b53-e2cbe128abee
27,methods28," For this SNP as well as for the other SNPs top-ranked in the region, Supplemental Table S3 shows the interaction effect and the corresponding beta in the two strata of Mediterranean diet. Thus, when adherence to Mediterranean diet is low, the minor allele is associated with an increase in serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations, whereas when adherence to Mediterranean diet is high, the minor allele is associated with a decrease in serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations. This interaction effect might be similar to the previously reported positive selection for the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) cluster [95], where depending on the diet, the prevalence of the allele resulting in the generation of higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations, changed in the different populations.  3.3.",f754ac21-e83f-44b3-b679-13f14f674007

Supplemental Figure S4 presents the corresponding Q–Q plot. In general, a similar pattern of genes and polymorphisms were detected for docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA) and total omega-3 and we also identified several associations at the genome-wide level of significance for docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA). Three SNPs in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1 gene (rs174547, rs174550, and rs174546) were the hits, having p-values of 1.28 × 10−11, 1.50 × 10−11, and 1.66 × 10−11). These SNPs were in very high LD.",8a5cf790-82ab-440b-9c8a-fc8e7aa0b951
29,methods30," Likewise, 4 SNPs in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)2 with p-values ranging from 2.87 × 10−11 to 3.47 × 10−10; 1SNP in FEN1-rs174538 (p = 3.47 × 10−10), 1 SNP in TMEM258 (p = 8.79 × 10−10), and 2 SNPs in MYRF, with p-values of 3.89 × 10−10 and 1.22 × 10−9, were statistically significant at the genome-wide level. Despite their significance, the genetic effect for docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA) was lower than that observed for total omega-3. Here, the top-ranked SNP (the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1), only explained the 10.6% of the variability, versus a 13.4%, explained by the same SNP for total omega-3. This indicates that here are other omega-3 fatty acids (not determined in this project) for which the genetic association effect should be higher.",ece3d0fe-cb5d-43c6-ad87-07f5e135b8c3
30,methods31,"  In the exploratory analysis of the genome-wide interaction by sex in determining serum docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA) concentrations, we found as top-ranked the same SNP that reached statistical significance at the genome wide association studies (GWAS) level for the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).

We can see that the genetic effect is lower for omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) compared to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in this population. The top-ranked SNP for omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) only accounted for 4.9% of variability in serum omega-6 concentrations, compared to 13.4% for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Furthermore, top-ranked SNPs were not polymorphisms in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) genes, but in other genes.

This gene, involved in brain signaling in the endothelium, is an integrative signal essential for neuro-glia-vascular communication [126]. Supplemental Table S5 shows the descriptors and coefficients of these SNPs. In the model adjusted for sex, age, and diabetes, the significance achieved by each of them was 5.25 × 10−10 for rs5994479 and 5.69 × 10−10 for DAB1-rs11207162. Although the variability explained by the top-ranked SNP is greater for LA (9.5%) than for total omega-6, it is still lower than for docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA).",9f5a51b4-9729-4b8f-acd5-7cb87c183c0e

This is highly consistent with that observed for total omega-6. Likewise, the top ranked gene–sex interaction for serum LA concentrations was observed with the gene DNTTIP2-rs3747965 at 1.04 × 10−7 level. For the genome-wide interactions with adherence to Mediterranean diet on serum LA, the top-ranked SNP was LOC105374410-rs1906292 at p = 8.88 × 10−7.

None of them reached the level of genome wide association studies (GWAS) significance and the p-values were higher than 3.12 × 10−6. This may reflect the greater heterogeneity of this variable.

Both in the unadjusted and in the multivariate adjusted models (for sex, age, and diabetes), several SNPs in the chromosome 11 (fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1/2 cluster) showed statistically significant associations with the omega-6/omega-3 ratio at the genome wide association studies (GWAS) level. The top-ranked SNP was the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1-rs174547 T > C in both models.

Furthermore, we analyzed the interaction between the adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the SNPs at the genome-wide level in determining the serum omega-6/omega-3 ratio (Supplemental Figure S11).

Discussion In this first genome wide association studies (GWAS) carried out in a Mediterranean population composed of subjects with metabolic syndrome in Spain, we confirmed the large contribution of the FASD1 gene cluster (chromosome 11) on total serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [94]. Despite the limited sample size, our findings show robust statistically significant associations with p < 5 × 10−8 for several SNPs in/near the FASD1 and FASD2 genes. The top-ranked SNP was the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1-rs174547 T > C.",1aabbf26-588f-413b-ba7c-745d82496949
45,methods46," This SNP was strongly associated with serum omega-3 concentrations even after additional adjustment for covariates (p = 3.34 × 10−14 in the model adjusted for sex, age, and diabetes). Further adjustments for medications, diet, and other lifestyle variables did not substantially change the statistical significance of the association. Likewise, some previous genome wide association studies (GWAS) [81,83,96] only adjusted the main statistical models for age and sex (and recruitment site in multicenter studies) and further evaluated the effect of additional adjustment for other covariates (dietary intake, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI)). After these additional adjustments, the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-SNP associations changed little, in agreement with our results testing sequential adjustments.",4188175b-9195-4553-b5d2-a6fd0e38ece1
46,methods47," In our population, the minor allele of the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1-rs174547 T > C top-ranked SNP (C allele) was associated with decreased serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations. This is consistent with functional studies showing a functional association between the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1-rs174547 and delta-5 desaturase activity [127]. Moreover, a recent study examining the effects of aging and fatty acid desaturase (FADS) polymorphisms on long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) biosynthetic capacity via direct quantification [128] has reported for the first time that aging especially decreases the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) biosynthetic capacity regulated by the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1-rs174547 SNP in fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1 C allele carriers [128].",d40e35d5-0127-4372-bb90-72729373f38b
47,methods48," The fact of studying an elderly population (subjects aged 55 to 75 years) is another factor that may have contributed to the differences detected between our study and others previously carried out [79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,93,98].  In our genome wide association studies (GWAS), in addition to the association with serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), we have studied the association with serum concentrations of docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid derived primarily from fish. For docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA) we have also obtained statistically significant associations at the genome wide association studies (GWAS) level with several SNPs in the genes fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1 and fatty acid desaturase (FADS)2 in agreement with the previous genome wide association studies (GWAS) analyzing docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA) concentrations, with fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1-rs174547 SNP also being the top-ranked.",b17216db-e3b2-4fd2-b7c4-4069c7c2b204
48,methods49,"  However, we did not detect statistically significant associations between the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1/fatty acid desaturase (FADS)2 cluster SNPs at the genome wide association studies (GWAS) level with total serum omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) or LA (omega-6). This result differs from other genome wide association studies (GWAS) studies [79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86]. The lack of association at the genome wide association studies (GWAS) level of the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1/fatty acid desaturase (FADS)2 SNPs with serum omega-6 may be due to several factors. One of them may be related to the age of our population. We have studied older subjects (mean age 65 years old), and it has been reported that aging decreases biosynthetic activity regulated by the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1 polymorphisms [128], so potentially decreasing the magnitude of the genetic associations at this locus.",bce4ee13-495e-47b4-a25c-f759b419f032
49,methods50," Along these lines, another factor influencing the activity of the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1/fatty acid desaturase (FADS)2/fatty acid desaturase (FADS)3 desaturases is the ethnic background [95]. Our Spanish Mediterranean population may differ from the majority of the other populations included in the previously published genome wide association studies (GWAS) [80,81,82,83,84,85,86]. Moreover, several environmental factors may contribute to the differences. Among them, the dietary pattern may play a relevant role. The existing genome wide association studies (GWAS) have been mainly carried out in American populations [81,83,96] as well as in Asian populations [84,86] having different diets. The Spanish Mediterranean population has been characterized over many years as one that follows the so-called traditional Mediterranean diet which is rich in vegetables, fruit, fish, olive oil and nuts, and low in red meats, butter, pastries and processed products [99].",a6349c0c-d1ca-4fc1-98c6-ec26d6a74c25
50,methods51," Nowadays, the younger population is turning away from the Mediterranean diet, but a fairly high adherence, on average, to the traditional Mediterranean diet can still be detected in the elderly, although variability in adherence also exists within this group [99,101]. Among the populations included in the previous genome wide association studies (GWAS) for circulating polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), the one that most resembles our population is the INCHIANTI study [79], focused on an Italian Mediterranean population. In the INCHIANTI study, a genome wide association studies (GWAS) was carried out on plasma levels of six omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in 1075 participants. In this study, the strongest evidence for global associations was found at the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1/fatty acid desaturase (FADS)2/fatty acid desaturase (FADS)3 cluster. This is similar to our results.",821fcfe9-abb0-44a5-800b-5cf76ccd003a
51,methods52," However, in the INCHIANTI study, the associations were mainly observed for some omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [79]. Thus, the SNP with the most significant association was rs174537 near fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1, in determining plasma arachidonic acid (AA) concentrations (p = 5.95 × 10−46). In our study, we did not analyze the association with AA, because the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform used for measuring serum fatty acids [110,111,112,113,114,115,116] did not provide the separate concentration of AA. Therefore, we cannot compare the results and this is a limitation of our study in comparison with other studies providing a more comprehensive profile of fatty acids determined in other platforms (80,81,83,84,86). However, in INCHIANTI, total omega-3 or total omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were not analyzed.",67a792f0-3057-4357-878c-b7766241c03a
52,methods53," In the INCHIANTI paper [79], the authors compared their results with those obtained in the GOLDN (Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network) study including American subjects (n = 1076) recruited in Minneapolis, MN and Salt Lake City, UT. For some associations, replications were found, but other associations were population specific. This observation was in agreement with our initial hypothesis regarding the interest in analyzing specific populations to better understand the associations. Again, diet could be an important driver, taking into account the differences in the diet consumed when comparing INCHIANTY and the GOLDN populations. Additionally, the authors, pointed out that the tissue selected for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) determination may be another cofounder when results are compared. In GOLDN, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were measured in erythrocyte membranes and in INCHIANTI, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were measured in plasma [79].",0ff1c60d-4d71-4e12-b3ac-c0116a7628c6
53,methods54," It has been reported that erythrocytes and plasma may reflect two slightly different pools of fatty acids [129]. In general, it is accepted that plasma fatty acids reflect a short term fatty acid intake whereas erythrocyte levels reflect a more long term intake. This limitation is also present in the studies meta-analyzing populations with different fatty acid determinations and may have an influence when comparing results [130]. Moreover, an additional limitation, even in studies analyzing plasma fatty acids, is the type of measurement. Thus, Wu et al.",2e4a2bb2-0c2f-48e1-8e02-3c9d27c3a98c
54,methods55," [83] in the meta-analysis that they carried out in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium outlined this potential limitation, specifically indicating that the INCHIANTI cohort measured total plasma fatty acids while the other 4 cohorts (ARIC, CARDIA, CHS, and MESA), measured plasma phospholipid fatty acids, and whether the scale of these different measurements is completely the same is unclear.  Another factor that may be related to some differences among studies when comparing genome wide association studies (GWAS)s is the medication use in the different populations. In previous genome wide association studies (GWAS) [79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86], no adjustment for medications has been reported. In our study, we fitted statistical models sequentially adjusted for sex, age, and diabetes in order to compare our results with the previously published studies having similar adjustment.",6fbfd78c-f030-47be-b9e7-8934aaccd42d
55,methods56," Additionally, we adjusted our main results for medications and this adjustment changed little the associations. However, an influence of lipid-lowering drugs (mainly statins) on polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) levels has been reported in other studies [131,132]. Therefore, additional analysis with a large sample size are needed to better understand the role (and potential gene*statins interactions) of the medications in determining polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations.  In addition to these limitations, sample size is another limitation for our study. Considering the strict threshold for statistically significant results at the GWAs level, some potential associations with relevant loci, might fail to be identified. Therefore, we conducted a region wide (RWAS), focused on previously identified regions considered as relevant for the genetic associations with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [4,94].",358012b3-9236-4a0c-84b8-886d7cf38099

After testing the SNPs in the candidate genes in these regions, we detected statistically significant associations with LA concentrations that were not detected as significant signals at the genome wide association studies (GWAS) level, supporting the associations between some fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1/fatty acid desaturase (FADS)2/fatty acid desaturase (FADS)3 SNPs and LA concentrations also in this population, but of a lower magnitude than the associations found for docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA) or total omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).",42ede070-9d0f-4016-8731-9ee2407b0402
57,methods58," Regarding the ELOVL region [4], although other studies have reported associations with several SNPs in these genes [79,81,82,83,84], in this Mediterranean population, the specific associations have been smaller, and even at the region wide (RWAS) level, no significant associations have been detected for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Only a few ELOVL2 SNPs presented significant associations at p < 0.05 with total serum omega-6 and LA.  These results emphasize the need to carry out specific studies to know which genetic variants are most relevant in each population, because the results of the most significant associations in a population or in a meta-analysis are not always those that are actually observed in a different population [89].",40dc385e-72ec-4abd-9df3-eae71bf13bc3
58,methods59," In the case of the genetics of serum polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), it is known that due to the relevance that these fatty acids have for the functioning of the organism [94], the prevalence of the different genetic variants in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1/FASD2 genes has been adapting to changes in the diet, with the aim of achieving the highest concentrations of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [96]. Several studies have analyzed the details of this so-called positive selection [95,96,97,98], and currently, the prevalence of genetic variants and the overall effect of enzymes may be different depending on the population analyzed [95,96,97,98].  Some genome wide association studies (GWAS) have considered dietary intake in adjustments carried out in the statistical analysis, indicating a modest influence [122]. However, to better understand dietary modulation, a gene*diet interaction analysis should be carried out.",5ce1d20f-9b66-4582-820b-0a8b8865e45f
59,methods60," Although some genome wide association studies (GWAS) and various candidate gene studies have examined the interaction between several dietary components (food or nutrients) and the genetic variants in determining polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations [1,60,83,129,130,131,132,133,134,135], the interaction with a whole dietary pattern such as the Mediterranean diet pattern [99], has not been comprehensively investigated. In an exploratory study, taking into account our limited sample size, we explored gene* Mediterranean diet interactions at the genome-wide level in determining serum polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Two categories (low and high adherence to Mediterranean diet) were analyzed using the same approach that we previously carried out in another genome-wide-interaction study with Mediterranean diet in the same population in determining plasma bilirubin concentrations [105].",30ad1545-47e7-4d47-af4f-f2a5c3ff4957
60,methods61," The most relevant gene*Mediterranean diet interaction was found for the ME1 gene in determining serum omega-3 concentrations. Several SNPs in this gene, having different minor allele frequency (MAF), reached statistical significance for the interaction term at p < 5 × 10−5. According to this interaction, the association between the ME1 genotypes and serum omega-3 depends on the adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern. Moreover, when we further analyzed the Mediterranean diet interaction at the genome wide association studies (GWAS) level in determining the serum omega-6/omega-3 ratio, we also obtained the ME1 as the top-ranked gene, replicating the results for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). This is the first time that this interaction is reported in humans and subsequent studies are needed to replicate and characterize the modulation. However, existing literature initially supports a potential mechanism behind this interaction.",9994204c-f3ae-4429-ac0a-d6450f46f66b
61,methods62," The ME1 gene encodes a cytosolic, NADP-dependent enzyme that produces NADPH for fatty acid biosynthesis [124]. Likewise, the ME1 gene has been implicated in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) biosynthesis [136,137,138]. Furthermore, in animal models, the ME1 gene expression is strongly regulated by the dietary fat content [125,139]. Fat content of the low or high adherence group (high adherence characterized by a high fish intake, nuts, olive oil, and a low intake of red meat and other products rich in saturated fatty acids (SFA)) may modulate the effects of the ME1 polymorphisms on serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (as well as on the omega-6/omega-3 ratio), contributing to explain the statistical signal. Our findings are exploratory and additional replication studies are needed to confirm this interaction.  Likewise, genetic modulation by sex may be another relevant factor explaining some differences in the effect of the genetics of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).",c852e940-020c-49d0-a3d9-2f47ec6ffc1b
62,methods63," Some polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are specifically required for reproduction [104]. It has been reported that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations are higher in females than in males during pregnancy and there are some studies showing sex-specific effects for some polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in determining several outcomes [68,69,70,71,72,73,74,140,141]. Although this is still an emerging field, the promotion of research investigating sex-specific differences [142] could provide more information regarding sex-specific effects on gene*sex interactions in determining polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) levels for a more personalized nutrition. Our genome-wide gene*sex interaction study, has revealed a statistically significant gene*sex interaction involving the DNTTIP2 gene (rs3747965) in determining serum total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (mainly omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)), at the genome-wide level of significance (p < 5 × 10−8).",9a9c1e3d-a070-4be2-b7d6-1e0fc947cb04
63,methods64," Again, this is the first time that this statistical interaction has been reported, and more studies are needed to replicate and characterize this interaction. The DNTTIP2 gene has the alternative name of “estrogen receptor-binding protein gene”, as well as the short name: “TdIF2” (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase interacting factor 2). The TdIF2/estrogen receptor α-binding protein (ERBP) is a multifunctional nucleolar protein. It promotes ribosomal RNA transcription by still partially unknown mechanisms [143]. Thus, there is a potential link between the SNP in this gene and estrogens [143], explaining the potential sex-specific interaction on polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The literature examining the DNTTIP2 is scarce, but in a recent genome wide association studies (GWAS), the DNTTIP2 gene has been linked to ischemic stroke [144], an outcome potentially linked to the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) modulations.",da7a08cb-c1ca-4a05-a6a9-81d431765df3
64,methods65," As stated before, this finding is only exploratory, and more research has to be done for replication and characterization. Overall, our novel findings provide a roadmap for further studies analyzing gene*sex and gene*diet interactions on polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations in different populations.  5. Conclusions In conclusion, our results allowed us to define the genetic variants most associated with serum polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) concentrations in a Mediterranean population with metabolic syndrome and to confirm the strong association between the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1/fatty acid desaturase (FADS)2 locus and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (specifically docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA)) in this population. The associations of this locus with omega-6 were much weaker, but also present at the region wide (RWAS) level.",12ae610c-aabd-44c9-a1d1-1cfdd48a6681
65,methods66," Likewise, we have observed a strong genetic influence of the fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1/fatty acid desaturase (FADS)2 cluster in determining the omega-6/omega-3 ratio, at the genome wide association studies (GWAS) level, in this population. We have also detected some new interactions with sex (on omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (on omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)), which will have to be replicated and functionally characterized in other studies. This underlines the need for these variables to be studied in all specific populations, so as to better understand the complex metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and their repercussions on health.
