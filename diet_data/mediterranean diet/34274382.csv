0,methods0," Study Population  The current study data were obtained from a large cohort study in Amol city (AmolCS) in the north of Iran. The details of the AmolCS are presented elsewhere (80). Briefly, in AmolCS, a total of 5,147 adults aged ≥18 years in both urban and rural areas were followed up for MeS, cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), diabetes mellitus, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). At the beginning of AmolCS, people who had a history of diseases, including malignancy, thyroid disorder, autoimmune diseases, and physical and mental disability, were excluded.  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  In this cross-sectional study, the study participants were adults of Iranian nationality aged ≥18 years, willing to engage in the study, and longtime inhabitants of Amol.",bae91f34-9549-4107-905f-8aa6319c0459
1,methods1," The exclusion criteria were alcohol consumption (>30 g/day for men and >20 g/day for women), viral hepatitis, regular consumption of drug-related steatosis (except for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)), lactation, pregnancy, and following a specific dietary or physical activity regimens.  A total of 829 subjects were eliminated due to missing data in assessing abdominal ultrasonography, food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)), and energy intake misreporting. Finally, data from 3,220 participants (1,438 females and 1,782 males) were analyzed.  The ethics committee of the Iran University of Medical Sciences (Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS)) approved the study, and all participants signed written informed consent.",a38483fb-5025-4ad9-bb0d-b0a58a9e176e
2,methods2,"  Demographic Characteristics and Anthropometric Measurements  Demographic characteristics, including age, smoking, physical activity (MET-h/d), alcohol drinking, and having diseases including diabetes, MeS, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), were obtained from the cohort study data. Anthropometric indices [waist circumference (WC), height, and weight] were measured in the participants, and body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated using the body mass index (BMI) = weight (kg)/height (m2) formula. Weight was measured in light clothing and reported to the closest 100 g. WC was measured using tape while standing with feet shoulder-width apart position in the midpoint between the iliac crest and lowest rib. Blood pressures were measured in a sitting position after five minutes of rest. A minimum of two readings at intervals of at least one minute was obtained, and the average of those readings was reported for the blood pressure of patients (81).",c33cf626-0eb2-43e2-8d68-56a863f0b342
3,methods3,"  Laboratory Measurements  One blood sample was drawn from participants after eight hours of fasting. Blood samples were incubated, and then they were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for ten min. Fasting blood sugar (Fasting blood sugar (FBS)), HbA1c, and lipid profiles, including HDL (high-density lipoprotein), TG (triglycerides), and TC (total cholesterol), were measured. In addition, alanine aminotransferase (aminotransferase (ALT)), aspartate aminotransferase (aminotransferase (AST)), gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT)), C reactive protein (CRP), hepatitis B virus surface antigens, and hepatitis C virus antibodies, were all assessed.  The A1C level was measured by a Variant machine (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). The BS200 Auto analyzer was used to assess laboratory measurements enzymatically according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Mindray, China).",a81b2311-b216-4ec1-ae25-81e78e3c2f26
4,methods4," The Friedewald equation was used to determine serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL)) (5). The third-generation ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay) technique was utilized to evaluate hepatitis B viruses (hepatitis B viruses (HBV)) indicators such as HbsAg, HBsAb, and HBcAb by Acon kits (Acon Laboratory, San Diego, CA, United States).  The Iranian National Reference Laboratory re-evaluated 10% of the blood samples, and all laboratory readings were found to have a variance coefficient of 1.7–3.8%.  Dietary Assessment  A validated semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) was used to evaluate the dietary intakes (82). For each food item on the list, participants were asked about the usual frequency of consumption in a commonly used unit or portion size (daily, weekly, and monthly) over the previous year.",87f278ec-5ea0-416f-b2ca-f4e753245846
5,methods5," The consumption intake of each food item was calculated as gram/day by household measures (83). The food composition table (food composition table (FCT)) of the United States Department of Agriculture (United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)) (84) and Iranian food composition table (FCT) for traditional Iranian foodstuffs (85) were used to determine nutrients and energy consumption.  Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension Score  Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension dietary score as a measure of adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern was calculated using the typical Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) diet rating initially defined by Fung et al. (29). This method considered quintile intakes of eight components (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy products, salt, red and processed meats, and sweetened drinks).",889a60ed-9cf0-4034-9478-0c63416241d8
6,methods6," The lowest intake receives one point, and the highest receives five points. The overall score ranges from 8 (the lowest adherence) to 40 (the highest adherence).  Mediterranean Diet Score  The degree of adherence to the MeD was assessed based on the Trichopoulou et al. scale (86). Each of the nine components was assigned a value of 0 or 1 on this scale, using the median as the cutoff threshold. Participants whose consumption was below the median for the beneficial components, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, cereal, and fish, were given a value of 0, while those whose consumption was at or above the median were given a value of 1. The above coding was inversely applied for dairy products, poultry, red, and processed meats (below the median consumption: value 1, equal or above the median consumption: value 0). Before the score ranking, the adjustment for energy intake using the residual method was made for all food groups.",1fbd2137-873e-4a2b-84b1-ab2d16598452
7,methods7,"  Dietary Acid Load  Three scores, including the net endogenous acid production (NEAP), potential renal acid load (PRAL) score, and the net NAE score, are commonly used to estimate Dietary Acid Load (DAL). The intestinal absorption rates for protein, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate define urine pH in healthy adults estimated by the potential renal acid load (PRAL) score. A positive potential renal acid load (PRAL) or net endogenous acid production (NEAP) score reflects an alkaline-forming potential, whereas a negative score is an acid-forming indicator (87, 88).  The following formula calculated net acid excretion (NAE):  1) Potential renal acid load (potential renal acid load (PRAL))  potential renal acid load (PRAL)(mEq/day)=[(0.49×protein[(g/day)]+[(0.037  ×phosphorus(mg/day)]-[(0.0211×potassium(mg/day)]   -[0.0263×magnesium⁢(mg/day)]  -[0.013×calcium⁢(mg/day)]  2) Organic acids (OA)  OA⁢(mEq/day)=[body⁢surface⁢area⁢(m2)]× 41⁢(mEq/day⁢per⁢ 1.73⁢m2).",c0260edc-0ecb-4ce7-93ca-32b195200bcf

9,methods9,"  Abdominal Ultrasonography  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was diagnosed by an expert radiologist using ultrasound sonography. A 3–5 MHz transducer was used to provide sagittal, longitudinal, lateral, and intercostal views. In the same way, blurring of portal or hepatic veins, as well as a significant rise in hepatic echogenicity, were related criteria for fatty liver confirmation.  Statistical Analysis  Participant characteristics, including age, physical activity, and mediating factors, such as Dietary Acid Load (DAL), HbA1c, body mass index (BMI), C reactive protein (CRP), MeS, and its components by gender, were summarized in terms of Mean ± SD for continuous variable and as a percentage (%) for categorical variables.  In the current study, the hypothesized model of the direct and indirect relationship among observed and latent variables was identified and evaluated through the following steps.",608c0aa8-fe4b-4f73-ad43-22a3a36511c9

The Link Between Dietary Patterns and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Using Structural Equation Modeling  Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension, MeD, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were fitted in models based on the primary hypothesis (Figures 3, 4). MeS, as a potential risk factor, directly affected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in all models. Age was a demographic factor that positively affected MeS and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The prevalence of MeS and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was higher in older adults.

Similarly in both genders, the relationship between MeD and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was mediated by two pathways, including (1) through the mediators of Dietary Acid Load (DAL), HbA1c, and MeS (of MeD to Dietary Acid Load (DAL), in males: β = −0.19, P < 0.001, in females: β = −0.23, P < 0.001; of Dietary Acid Load (DAL) to HbA1c, in males: β = 0.08, P < 0.001, in females: β = 0.09, P < 0.001; of HbA1c to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in males: β = 0.05, P = 0.02, in females: β = 0.06, P = 0.02) and (2) through the mediators of Dietary Acid Load (DAL) and MeS (of Dietary Acid Load (DAL) to MeS, in both genders: β = 0.13, P < 0.001; of MeS to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in males: β = 0.60, P < 0.001, in females: β = 0.80, P < 0.001).",11686522-39fd-4d19-95b1-cddcaf373845

19,discussion0," To our knowledge, this is the first study to have examined the association between adherence to healthy dietary patterns and the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a large-scale general population using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The main advantage of the structural equation modeling (SEM) method is its ability to explore complex correlations among variables using a systematic approach while also managing measurement errors (93).  The findings of the current study suggested that Dietary Acid Load (DAL), HbA1c, and MeS were the main mediators of the association between low adherence to healthy diets (Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) and MeD) and the high prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous studies have discussed the relationship between the components of MeS and the risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (94).",9e020dc6-84fa-4737-99e2-a00a5b92b04e
20,discussion1," Indeed, in a meta-analysis, Sookoian and Pirola (95) explored 15 well-structured studies and concluded that the components of MeS were strong predictors of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Our findings were concordant with previous studies suggesting that MeS remains the most potent factor related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk (96).  In our study, adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) was indirectly (through the negative effect on Dietary Acid Load (DAL) and MeS) associated with a lower prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Several mechanisms may explain the health benefits of the Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern. High consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and unsaturated vegetable oils characterizes this diet. High dietary fiber consumption attenuates metabolic abnormalities, including TG and abdominal obesity, by delaying stomach emptying (97).",d3e3f19e-ae38-4f29-af43-124af820c8bf
21,discussion2," Calcium, another crucial Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) component, protects against MeS by lowering adiposity (98). It is also crucial to reduce fat absorption by forming insoluble fatty acid soaps in the gut. Therefore, calcium plays a critical function in WC reduction (98). Moreover, it is low (≤5 serves of sweets and added sugars per week for a 2,000-calorie diet) in sugar-sweetened drinks, added sugars, and red and processed meats (99). As a result, this diet improves glycemic and lipid metabolism and aids weight loss while lowering cardiovascular disease (CVD)s. All of these outcomes are primary goals of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) treatment; hence, this diet has attracted the attention of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) specialists.",58e94c4b-d986-4b02-823b-21db780cc077
22,discussion3," In a randomized controlled trial of 60 obese adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and elevated serum aminotransferase (ALT) levels, the results revealed that consumption of the Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) diet for eight weeks decreased body mass index (BMI) and steatosis severity, as well as improved aminotransferases and metabolic markers, including insulin, HOMA index, serum TG, and the total to HDL cholesterol ratio compared to control group (97). Other studies among the Chinese general population have reported an inverse association between adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) and risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (with 22 and 18% low risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) (22, 35).",cda822fc-fd5b-4e8f-bb30-f31112efd393
23,discussion4,"  On the other hand, the Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH)-type dietary pattern as an alkali-rich diet containing high amounts of alkalizing minerals, potassium, calcium, and magnesium could explain the Dietary Acid Load (DAL) lowering effect of this diet (100, 101). Indeed, adherence to the MeD pattern in both genders was indirectly associated with the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in this population through the negative effect on Dietary Acid Load (DAL) and MeS. The MeD is characterized by high consumption of legumes, grains, vegetables, fresh fruits, olive oil, and nuts. Fish and white meat are consumed in moderation in this diet, and the consumption of red and processed meats and high-fat dairy products are limited.",f3a6ea02-76e7-4d00-a91c-0ced74cf8093
24,discussion5," The MeD is also characterized by a low ratio of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and cholesterol (9% total energy intake); whilst, in contrast, mono-unsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)s) and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are high (19% total energy intake from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and 5% total energy intake from PUFA), with a favorable ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 (102).  Several studies have reported that dietary patterns high in omega-3 PUFAs can lower insulin resistance and intrahepatic TG levels, resulting in steatohepatitis improvement (102).  Furthermore, PUFAs have been shown to help prevent cardiovascular events by improving insulin sensitivity, functioning as an anti-inflammatory, and lowering oxidative stress (7).  The MeD also has a high content (55–60% of the total energy intake) of complex carbs and fibers, which helps to prevent fatty liver disease.",99ac5c87-bcde-433a-bc67-70c80bbc4dca
25,discussion6," In epidemiological studies, refined sugar, particularly high-fructose corn syrup, has been linked to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk (103). Furthermore, the MeD is high in whole grains, which includes a lot of fiber, which may be advantageous to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients for various reasons. The first is that regulation of gut microbiota through their prebiotic actions may be improved, which is known to play a role in the development and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Second, whole grain consumption can reduce the risk of dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes (37, 80, 104). Another feature of the MeD is low consumption of red and processed meat, including SFAs and cholesterol, which has been linked to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development in case-control and cross-sectional studies (11, 105).",5906a7c9-fde4-41ce-814e-d271fbfa6e67
26,discussion7,"  The content of vegetables and fruits in MeD are sources of potassium salts of organic acids, which form bicarbonate; thus, MeD is net-base-yielding and can reduce Dietary Acid Load (DAL) (106). Observational studies reveal that a low Dietary Acid Load (DAL) may help to reduce the incidence of obesity, MeS, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD)s, and mortality (107–110). The underlying mechanisms that link Dietary Acid Load (DAL) to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be related to the Insulin Resistance (IR) associated with acidic diets. The consequent hyperglycemia appears to increase the inflammation and IR in the liver, which may cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to increase available free fatty acids (110). In Asian adults, Chan et al.",413ec2ba-dd85-4a01-a768-76f34daade0b
27,discussion8,", in a study conducted on 793 subjects, reported a positive association between estimated diet-induced acid load via net endogenous acid production (NEAP) with an increased likelihood of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (111).  Although we present a novel addition to the literature, our study also has several limitations. First, the conclusions of this study may not apply to other countries, particularly the western population, given that the study sample was drawn only from the Iranian people. Because different countries have diverse eating cultures, more research is needed to ascertain whether the mediation model proposed in this study can be applied to other countries with different dietary patterns. Second, because we lacked data on socioeconomic factors such as education level, job position, income, and ethnicity information (112) as well as OCP (113) and supplement (114) usage, some confounders may not have been captured and adjusted in the proposed mediation model.",9e482331-5fc8-48ac-a2d5-4cffa43893aa
28,discussion9," As a result, considering the potential influence of such uncontrolled confounders, the results should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, the findings of the current study can be used to offer baseline data and/or markers for future studies to control confounding variables. Third, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is a dietary evaluation instrument with a strong recall bias. Despite this, food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s are still the most common dietary assessment technique in cohort studies. Finally, the cross-sectional nature of the present study precludes making inferences regarding the directionality of the association, resulting in a high risk of reverse-causality bias.  The causal links between mediators and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are unclear because the mediators and follow-up nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) status were collected at the same time.",2b236cfc-6842-4770-a255-e0601cefe369
29,discussion10," As a result, more research is needed to determine whether strategies for addressing mediated disorders can also treat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) problems among the general population.  Conclusion  The present study found three important mediators, including Dietary Acid Load (DAL), HbA1c, and MeS, in associating current dietary patterns and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Based on our findings, adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) and MeD should be emphasized in programs attempting to elicit changes in lifestyle for subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study suggests that preventive and therapeutic interventions should target the mediators, Dietary Acid Load (DAL), HbA1c, MeS, and their components, to reduce nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) incidence in the general population.",f65888b6-fd3f-40f2-9189-e752306a1f03
