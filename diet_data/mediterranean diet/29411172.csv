0,introduction0,"Impaired glucose and lipid metabolism together with increased blood pressure, that characterize a pro-inflammatory state (1–3) lead to an increased likelihood of insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis/cardiovascular disease (2), which are the commonest metabolic dysfunctions in humans. These alterations, together with a resulting pre-thrombotic state (3) may result in premature death. Since 1979, after the milestone publication of Keys et al. (4), it was evidenced that the Mediterranean-type of diet resulted in a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease, despite its high (especially mono-unsaturated) lipid content, of which olive oil is the main source. Indeed, a large body of scientific evidence confirmed the benefits of Mediterranean diet and olive oil consumption, on the lipid profile, lipid and DNA oxidation, insulin resistance, and inflammation (5–8), resulting in a decreased cardiovascular risk.",3340398e-8636-4102-9115-ca3d9fc25844
1,introduction1,"  Olive oil is a functional food that, besides its high content in mono-unsaturated fatty acids, also contains other minor, biologically active, components, such as vitamins, minerals, and polyphenols (9). The quality of olive oil is mainly defined by EU regulations (2568/91/EEC & 1019/2002/EC), which state the requirements for each commercial type: extra-virgin olive oil (produced by direct-press or simple, low-speed, centrifugation methods), virgin, common or refined olive oil. However, even extra-virgin olive oil may differ in terms of its microconstituents, related to the method of isolation, micro-climate, and cultivation conditions.  Health effects of olive oil, primarily as a constituent of the Mediterranean diet, has been the subject of many studies (10–22) and were mainly attributed to its polyphenol content. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and improvement in endothelial dysfunction and lipid profile have been reported for dietary polyphenols (21, 23).",5050292a-d3e6-4000-8b03-75a2aa4fb483
2,introduction2,"  Here, we have used published human intervention studies using olive oil, totalizing 7688 subjects, mostly out of the context of the Mediterranean diet and performed a network meta-analysis of metabolic changes in circulating glucose and lipid parameters, in relation to the polyphenol load of the oil. Network meta-analysis reports a final effect of a given intervention, considering both direct and indirect interactions. In addition, we extracted data related to inflammation and oxidation status and analyzed them separately, in a narrative review, as the number of studies was small. We provide novel data on the effect of olive oil and suggest a possible paradigm shift for its use in human nutrition.  ",a53e3a1f-87f7-4dc7-89a8-c2623bd1aec8
3,methods0,"Studies were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar, using the terms: “(olive oil) AND (intervention study) AND diet AND human” at 20 September 2017. A total of 465 unique records were retrieved (excluding reviews) and scanned for changes of metabolic (glucose, total-, HDL (HDL)- and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides), markers. The search strategy and details of the excluded studies are presented in Figure 1 (PRISMA flow chart). Details of the retained studies are presented in Table 1.

7,results0,"Description of the Studies Most of the included studies were randomized cross-over controlled clinical trials with dietary interventions (Table 1). The characteristics of participants were: healthy subjects in the majority (70%) of the studies. Participants with an established metabolic syndrome were reported in 2 studies and with hypercholesterolemia in 6 studies, while patients with an established cardiovascular or peripheral vascular disease were reported in one study. Postmenopausal women, which were reported in 2 studies, were included in the healthy participant's category. Only males participated in 15 studies and only women in 2 studies, while both sexes were reported in 13 studies. Eleven studies covered a wide range of ages from 18 to 89 years, others (10) focused only on young adults (aged 18–40 years), others (7) examined middle-aged (45–60 years) and the rest of the studies (2) focused on old aged participants >65 years.",5ddadd6b-9d4d-4737-a788-67c68c7da792
8,results1," In most studies (21), the number of participants ranged from 10 to 100 (with exception one study that it was <10), in others (4) the number of participants ranged from 100 to 200 and it was >200 in 4 studies.  The intervention period of most studies (40%), including the washout periods, lasted 2–3 months (30%), 3–12 months (20%), and in 10% the intervention period was over 1 year. The dietary interventions included the consumption of olive oil with a different polyphenol content. In most studies (57%), participants consumed extra- or virgin olive oil high in polyphenols (high in polyphenols (HPOO)), over common or refined olive oil, low in polyphenols (low in polyphenols (LPOO)). In addition, several studies (20%) used extra- or virgin olive oil, in comparison with other oils (corn, fish, etc.).  In most studies (36.6%) participants received a daily dose of 25 ml olive oil and 15 ml in one study. In some studies (16.",1bd36dc1-dc86-4565-9fb3-d932caf8d956
9,results2,"6%), the participants received a daily olive oil dose of 40 ml (2 studies) and 50 ml (3 studies) and in the rest of the studies (10%), the participants received 68–70 g of olive oil per day.  Effect of Olive Oil on Metabolic Parameters The network meta-analysis revealed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet significantly decreased circulating glucose levels (Standardized difference d = −0.105, 95%CI = −0.174, −0.036), total cholesterol (d = −0.191, 95%CI = −0.259, −0.122), LDL-cholesterol (d = −0.189, 95%CI = −0.238, −0.140) and oxidized LDL levels (d = −0.112, 95%CI = −0.375, 0.150), as compared to the control, westernized diet. Intervention with olive oil decreased this change gradually, related to its polyphenol content. In addition, adherence to the Mediterranean diet significantly increased HDL (HDL)-cholesterol (d = 0.113, 95%CI = 0.064, 0.163).",a93d41ad-4bb7-44f3-9ab4-3b5ae2b532e7
10,results3," However, low polyphenol content olive oil did not further modify HDL (HDL) levels, while high polyphenol olive oil increased HDL (HDL)-cholesterol concentration by almost 50% (d = 0.163, 95%CI = 0.080, 0.255). Figure 2 depicts these network meta-analysis changes, while Supplemental Figures 1–6 present the analysis of individual studies.  Figure 2 Network meta-analysis of circulating glucose (Glu), triglyceride (TC), total (TC), HDL (HDL)- (HDL (HDL)), LDL-cholesterol (LDL), and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) circulating levels in the 30 human studies, presented in Table 1. high in polyphenols (HPOO) stands for olive oil high in polyphenols, while low in polyphenols (LPOO) presents data of olive oil, low in polyphenols. Standardized differences from a control (westernized) diet are presented, together with their 95% confidence intervals.",bb3e42fe-83c6-4d18-bbfa-4cda7ef0839c
11,results4,"  Analyzing further the direct and indirect contribution of the Mediterranean diet adherence and the effect of high and low-polyphenol content olive oil in these changes (see the Materials and Methods section for details of the used methodology and Supplemental Tables 1–6) it becomes apparent that the main driver for glucose, triglycerides, total and LDL cholesterol is the Mediterranean diet per se, suggesting that this impact on cardio-metabolic biochemical indices may be driven by a number of constituents, in addition to those included in the olive oil (see for example the direct effect of high in polyphenols (HPOO) on LDL levels (d = −0.074, as compared to its indirect effect, when the Mediterranean diet is also included (d = −0.116), Supplemental Table 5). In contrast, the effect of olive oil on HDL (HDL) concentration is directly related to its polyphenol content, as detailed in Supplemental Table 4.",4f5d8d3f-52ba-4220-8c62-772ce8c55bae
12,results5,"  In conclusion, a network meta-analysis of olive oil intervention studies in humans suggests that the only direct impact of olive oil polyphenols in cardio-metabolic biochemical indices is its direct effect of HDL (HDL)-cholesterol levels, while other parameters (blood glucose, triglyceride, LDL) are modified because of the Mediterranean diet, in which olive oil is a major constituent. In addition, our data confirm the beneficial effect of the Mediterranean toward a westernized diet pattern.  Effect of Olive Oil on Oxidative Parameters An increased resistance of LDL to oxidation is reported in 5/6 studies, a decrease in LDL oxidation rate is found in 3/4 studies, and the detection of antibodies against oxLDL was also decreased by intervention with olive oil (Table 2). However, no correlation between polyphenol content and the resistance of LDL to oxidation was found. These data suggest that a moderate polyphenol content may be sufficient to protect LDL from oxidation.",1d004652-37d4-4246-8c44-760b45f65285
13,results6," Further evidence for this is reflected by the decrease of hydroxyl fatty acids and the Lipoprotein lipase gene expression, which increased significantly (+26%) after a high polyphenol olive oil intervention (49), suggesting a direct effect of polyphenols to the transcription of lipid enzyme regulation. These data further verify our network meta-analysis of oxLDL, presented above, which indicates that the major impact on oxLDL is the adherence to the Mediterranean diet, further suggesting that many of the olive oil-attributed benefits might be related to other microconstituents of elements of this diet, in addition to olive oil polyphenols.  Table 2 Percentage (absolute) changes in the oxidative parameters related to the LDL oxidation after treatment with olive oil with different phenolic content (oxLDL is presented in the network meta-analysis section).

14,results9,"  DNA oxidation parameters (oxidized DNA bases, DNA breaks and 8-oxo-dG in urine) were decreased by 3–61% after olive oil intervention (Table 3). Here too, no direct correlation with the polyphenol content was observed, suggesting that a moderate content of polyphenols (calculated by linear regression to 56 mg polyphenols/L olive oil) may be sufficient to prevent nucleic acid oxidation. Corroborating to this effect, the plasma antioxidant capacity (measured by different methods, accessing discrete antioxidant molecules in the plasma/serum) presented an increase after olive oil intervention, indicative of an enhanced role of polyphenols in increasing the organism's antioxidant capacities. Here too, the effect is also observed with low polyphenol content (necessary dose of 98 mg/L), suggesting that other elements may be also interfering with the observed decrease.",3d95fc8f-d4ca-4877-a4a7-809845ce6faf
15,results12,"  Effect of Olive Oil on Inflammatory Markers High sensitivity CRP decreased in all, but one studies after the olive oil-high polyphenol content intervention (Table 4). The biggest reductions (−39.4 and −35.86%) in CRP were observed after instauration of a Mediterranean diet profile with the inclusion of olive oil, regardless of its polyphenol content. It is also to note that in one of these investigations, the target group was patients with a diagnosed metabolic syndrome, while in another one, patients with cardiovascular disease were included. Finally, several cytokines were also decreased after olive oil ± Mediterranean diet intervention.

17,discussion0,"Diets following the principles of the Mediterranean diet, rich in vegetables, legumes, and olive oil have proven their beneficial character in preventing cardiovascular disease (54), diabetes (55–58), and hyperlipidemia (59). These effects were mainly attributed to the antioxidant fraction of microconstituents present in olive oil and in other elements of this diet (fruits, vegetables). In fact, a meta-analysis of 50 studies and 534,906 individuals revealed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with reduced risk of metabolic syndrome (60) and their participants expressed lower levels of inflammatory markers related to atherosclerosis (61).  The beneficial role of olive oil consumption is nowadays widely recognized, with the European Food Safety Authority (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)) approving two health claims regarding olive oil (62).",eaf146a2-8dd3-45f1-804c-6aeb7b127f07
18,discussion1," They suggest its use to replace saturated fats to keep normal blood cholesterol levels and protect blood lipids from oxidative stress, with the later effect to be achieved by olive oil polyphenols contained in a daily intake of 20 g of extra-virgin olive oil.  In order to delineate the exact role of olive oil in the above metabolic changes, we have performed a network meta-analysis of 30 human intervention studies. Network meta-analysis evaluates, in addition to the direct effects of each treatment/intervention, the indirect effects resulting from the linear interaction between the network components.",5f2934c6-254f-434a-b556-849150a9f811
19,discussion2," For example, the effect of high in polyphenols (HPOO) on glucose levels, shown in the scheme below Supplemental Table 1 is the integrator of its direct effect (line control-high in polyphenols (HPOO)) and the indirect effects (control-low in polyphenols (LPOO)-high in polyphenols (HPOO) and Control-MedDiet-high in polyphenols (HPOO)), while the impact of the MedDiet in the same scheme is its direct effect on glucose (line Control-MedDiet) and the sum of its indirect effects (Control-high in polyphenols (HPOO)-MedDiet and Control-low in polyphenols (LPOO)-MedDiet) (see Salanti et al. (53) and references therein for a thorough description of the Network meta-analysis theory and applications). Using this approach, we show that the effect of olive oil on glucose and circulating lipids cannot be distinguished from the effect of adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern, while the only clear-cut effect of a high-polyphenol olive oil is its effect on HDL (HDL)-cholesterol.",56c6a82a-0c09-4d48-b2d0-505a819901b7
20,discussion3," In this respect, we confirm our recent findings (63) that olive polyphenols, administered in a functional food and at a dose compatible with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)-suggested dose of olive oil, do not modify the circulating glucose levels, while they ameliorate insulin sensitivity. These results were further corroborated by the reported direct protective effect of polyphenols in the pancreas (64) and the amelioration of insulin secretion through an anti-inflammatory action of oleic acid (65).  The effect of olive oil on circulating lipids has been extensively analyzed, in the context of the Mediterranean diet, taking into consideration their impact on cardiovascular diseases (54, 59) and the direct effect of olive oil is clearly demonstrated in performed meta-analyses (14, 22). In addition, George et al.",10211a7d-13e6-48bb-bf29-3375225d5d35
21,discussion4," (21) reported a moderate reduction of CVD risk by high-polyphenol olive oil, including effects on different oxidative parameters, total, HDL (HDL)- and oxLDL-cholesterol. However, the authors reported the risk of biases, while the effect of the Mediterranean diet was not accessed. In the PREvencion con DIeta MEDiterranea (PREDIMED) (13) and in a recent meta-analysis (13), the effect of high in polyphenols (HPOO) as a protective agent in stroke but not in CVD was reported. Here, we show that the main effect of high in polyphenols (HPOO) is the increase of circulating HDL (HDL), while other effects on cardio-metabolic parameters should be attributed to the Mediterranean diet per se. Additionally, the effect of olive oil on triglycerides might be mainly attributed to the lipid fraction than to microconstituents, as it is the same in high and low polyphenol content.",3e8ad29f-3f72-4c2e-9bab-6199ffa5aed8
22,discussion5," These observed effects may be related to the reported impact of oleic acid and its metabolites, as well as of olive oil polyphenols on different enzymes, signaling molecules and a direct effect on the transcription of different proteins, including lipid-related, -transporting, or -metabolizing enzymes (31, 66–73).  Analyzing further the retained studies, we report (in a narrative review rather than through a meta-analysis, in view of the small number of studies) the effect of olive oil, high or not in antioxidant polyphenols, on oxidation and inflammation parameters. This effect of olive oil polyphenols has retained an increased attention, in view of the deleterious effect of oxidized lipids and nucleic acid damage, related to chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer (31, 67, 69, 71, 72, 74, 75). Analysis of our dataset confirmed the effect of olive oil polyphenols in protecting LDL and nucleic acid oxidation, in accordance to previous meta-analysis (76).",81136b9a-215f-4435-8aa8-cee3bd8ac0fd
23,discussion6," However, an unexpected result reported here is that a much lower than the previously reported concentration of olive oil polyphenols is required to induce this protection (~60 mg/L of olive oil). This finding is in contradiction to the current belief that markers of oxidation (such as oxLDL and nucleic acid oxidation) are inversely related to the polyphenol content of olive oil, while the plasma antioxidant activity is directly related to it. The results of our analysis, if verified in prospective studies, could, therefore, provide a paradigm shift to currently established beliefs and might have a direct impact on the olive oil industry and human nutrition. It is further to note that the effect of olive oil on inflammatory markers is mainly evident in patients with an established metabolic syndrome (27), or in patients with cardiovascular disease (26), providing evidence of a possible protective/therapeutic use of olive oil in such conditions.",c4f25862-27d1-4506-8a79-08c83375a58d
24,discussion7,"  The novel element of the present meta-analysis consists of the estimation of low in polyphenols (LPOO) and high in polyphenols (HPOO) effects on cardio-metabolic parameters through a network analysis, estimating both their direct and indirect effects. Our data suggest that the major effect on these parameters is mediated through an adherence to the Mediterranean diet, while the only notable effect of olive oil polyphenols is the increase of HDL (HDL)-cholesterol and the amelioration of the antioxidant and inflammatory status of the subjects. This effect is more pronounced in subjects with an established metabolic syndrome or other chronic conditions/diseases, evidencing its beneficial health effects. In addition, we report that much lower antioxidant polyphenols may be sufficient for the beneficial effects of olive oil, while we show that the lipid fraction of olive oil may be responsible for some of its beneficial actions.",7dc1152a-8ccf-4162-80e5-4b29d988f181
