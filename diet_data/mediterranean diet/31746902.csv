0,methods0,"2.1. Participants The sample included 73 volunteers recruited in Asturias (North of Spain), aged between 56 and 95 years and with a Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) [weight (kg)/height (m2)] from 19.9 to 37.5 kg/m2. In an individual interview, volunteers were informed about the objectives of the study and an informed written consent was obtained before enrolment. Exclusion criteria were the presence of diagnosed immune or digestive related pathologies as well as consumption of corticoids, immunosuppressive drugs, monoclonal antibodies, probiotics or antibiotics in the previous month. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee for Clinical Research (Servicio de Salud del Principado de Asturias nº 17/2010).  2.2.",d625a479-d673-418b-8450-eda6b8122da6
1,methods1," Nutritional Assessment A previously validated annual semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [26,27] was used by trained personnel to assess volunteers’ regular food intake in a personal interview of approximately 1 h duration. Methodological issues about dietary assessment were published elsewhere [28]. Food composition tables of Centro de Ensenanza Superior de Nutricion Humana y Dietetica (CESNID) (Centro de Enseñanza Superior de Nutrición Humana y Dietética) were used to transform food consumption into energy and macronutrients intake [29]. The (poly)phenol content in foods was completed using the Phenol Explorer database [30]. Fiber components were determined using the Marlett et al. food composition tables [31]. Glucosinolates levels were obtained from McNaughton et al.",83edf9e0-c101-4999-9eeb-a98f78f46dd3
2,methods2," [32] and isothiocyanates along with aliphatic glucosinolates food content were derived from glucosinolates levels following European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) criteria [33]. Glucosinolate side chains concentrations were ascertained from International Agency for Research of Cancer (International Agency for Research of Cancer (IARC)) data [34]. At the time of carrying out the blood extraction, height and weight were taken by standardized protocols [35]. At the same time as the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) interview was conducted, a questionnaire on socio-economic factors (such as level of education or type of work) and lifestyle (physical activity, smoking and self-perception of health status) was administered.  2.3.",99b63d17-3fc7-4924-aa4d-bfd7938299c1
3,methods3," Dietary Indices Calculation A calculation of seven dietary indices was carried out, including Dietary inflammatory index (DII), EDietary inflammatory index (DII), Healthy Eating Index (HEI), AHealthy Eating Index (HEI), Mediterranean adapted Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) [36], Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS)) [37] and relative Mediterranean Diet Score (rMED) [38], as shown in Supplementary Table S1. IBM SPSS program version 24.0 (IBM SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to design a database for calculating indices scores from our food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data.  Dietary inflammatory index (DII) scores were calculated by evaluating 35 parameters (out of 45 possible items). Components such as eugenol, ginger, saffron, turmeric, green/black tea, isoflavones, pepper, thyme/oregano and rosemary were excluded because a lack of information about them in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) recordings.",58409af7-fdac-4dec-b1ff-87e7ad5237bb
4,methods4," First, the consumption levels of parameters were standardized by subtracting daily global consumption mean and dividing by the global standard deviation. The resulting Z-scores were then converted to percentile scores and centered by doubling and subtracting one. These centered-percentile scores were multiplied by the overall food parameter-specific inflammatory effect score to obtain the ‘food parameter-specific score’ (FPES). All FPES of an individual were summed to obtain the final Dietary inflammatory index (DII) Score. Values in our sample ranged from −4.62 to 4.45, with negative scores predicting lower inflammation and positive scores higher dietary-derived inflammation.  For EDietary inflammatory index (DII) scores, 18 components were accounted. The number of servings consumed was calculated for each component. The resulting values were multiplied by the “Weight” of the components and divided by 1000.",743c45eb-3026-4b8d-9c7c-87b1892ec912
5,methods5," All weighted components were summed to obtain each EDietary inflammatory index (DII) Score, with values ranging from −1.56 to 2.21 in our sample. The more positive the result, the more prone to higher concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers.  The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) is an index comprised of 13 components. For each parameter, the amount of a dietary component, in g, cups or oz equivalents were calculated per 1000 kcal. These densities were scored according to recommended consumption values. For negative scoring components, considered to be consumed in small quantities due to their negative impact on health, the individuals get higher scores when the consumption values are lower than the established threshold. Then, all components were summed to obtain the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score. Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was reflecting a total score from 29.49 to 77.76 in our sample, with higher values reflecting a healthier diet.",e40bde44-d68d-41dd-901e-65b7222032fd
6,methods6,"  AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) score calculations procedure was quite similar to that of Healthy Eating Index (HEI), with 11 components in total and values from 37.34 to 80.79 in our sample. In the same way, higher values represent healthier diets. For each component, the consumption in servings per day was calculated and scored according to AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 criteria. All components were summed to obtain the total AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) score of each individual.  Considered the most suitable index for international analyses, DQI-I accounts for 18 components. Here, we evaluated a Mediterranean adaptation of DQI-I. The amount consumed of each component was rated from 0 to 3, 5 or 6, depending on the component and all the points were summed to obtain DQI-I scores, whose final values were between 33 and 68 (minimum and maximum).",be1d853d-c6bc-4bc6-9353-227ff5c41ee8
7,methods7," Here, a total sum of 100 would show an individual with perfect adherence to the main four categories evaluated in this index, while a score of 0 is reflecting a diet far away from recommended dietary guidelines.  Composed of 9 components, rMED and Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS) were derived from the index originally developed by Trichopoulou et al. [11] to evaluate the degree of adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet. rMED was calculated from components intake based on the density nutrients model. Once amounts of consumption per 1000 kcal were obtained, the sample was split in tertiles for each of the nine components. According to the tertile position for each component, individuals were rated. Summing all the ratings we obtained the rMED score, ranging from 2 to 12 in our sample. In the case of Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS), each parameter was scored 0 or 1 according to the cut-off values of the sex specific-medians among the participants.",f4befb2d-5f74-4e06-9cd5-419a397cca0c
8,methods8," Final Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS) scores ranged from 1 to 7 in our sample. In both indices, the highest scores are showing a higher adherence to Mediterranean diet patterns.  2.4. Blood Biochemical Analyses Fasting blood samples were drawn by venipuncture and centrifuged (1000× g, 15 min). Plasma and serum aliquots were kept at −20 °C for later analyses. Serum glucose, serum total cholesterol, serum HDL-cholesterol, serum LDL-cholesterol and serum triglycerides were determined by using an automated biochemical autoanalyzer in an independent laboratory. Serum levels of C reactive protein (CRP) were determined by ELISA (C reactive protein (CRP) Human Instant ELISA, Ebioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and malondialdehyde (malondialdehyde (MDA)) by a colorimetric assay of lipid peroxidation (Byoxytech LPO-586 assay, Oxis International S.A., Paris, France) [39]. Serum leptin was determined by ELISA (Human Leptin ELISA Development Kit 900-K90, PeproTech Inc.",ca203d24-b4e7-4103-993f-7aa4cd67bfc5
9,methods9,", Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Colorimetric assay P40117 (Innoprot, Innovative Technologies in Biological Systems, S.L., Spain) was used to determine total antioxidant capacity (total antioxidant capacity (TAC)) in serum [40]. A multiplex immunoassay (Cytometric Bead Array, CBA, BD Biosciences) by flow cytometry allowed to quantify levels of serum IL-10, Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-α), IL-8, IL-17 and IL-12, while the concentration of transforming growth factor (transforming growth factor (TGF))-β was determined by ELISA (BD OptEIATM, BD Biosciences). The phagocytic capacity was quantified in a FACSCanto II Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) by using the Phagotest® kit (Orpegen Pharma, Heildelberg, Germany). Natural killer (NK) cell activity was determined by flow cytometry, using the NKtest® kit (Orpegen Pharma).  2.5.",75132b3c-f35c-442d-997d-e66b6bf0e2d6
10,methods10," Fecal Collection and Microbial Analysis Detailed instructions about fecal samples collection were given to participants who also were provided with a sterile container. After deposition, samples were immediately frozen at −20 °C and transported to the laboratory. For analyses, samples were thawed at room temperature (24 ± 2 °C), weighed, diluted 1/10 in sterile PBS and homogenized using a LabBlender 400 Stomacher (Seward Medical, London, UK) for 4 min; the DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA stool mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following previously described procedures [41]. 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) were used to achieve the quantification of bacterial populations, including the major bacterial groups present in the human gut (Supplementary Table S2). Procedure instructions were published elsewhere [41].",19149bf9-6471-40f4-a0be-c9ea17338005
11,methods11," Fecal DNA extracts were analyzed and the mean quantity per gram of fecal wet weight was calculated for each bacterial group. One milliliter of the homogenized feces were centrifuged and supernatants were analyzed by gas chromatography to determine acetate, propionate and butyrate concentrations, as previously indicated [42]. A chromatograph 6890N (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) connected to a mass spectrometry detector (MS) 5973N (Agilent Technologies) and a flame ionization detector (flame ionization detector (FID)) was used for identification and quantification of short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s, respectively, as described previously [43].  2.6. Statistical Analyses Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS program version 24.0 (IBM SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).",85241369-ca33-4bd4-8660-83e19f972f85
12,methods12," Mean dietary scores were analyzed by a Student t-test and Bonferroni multiple comparison according to general, socio-economic and health-related characteristics, such as smoking status, educational level, mood feeling or self-health perception among others. Similar procedure was performed to analyze mean levels of microbiological and blood variables according to age group. Goodness of fit to the normal distribution was analyzed employing the Kolmogorov−Smirnov test. Scores were examined as predictors of gut microbial groups, fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s and blood biomarkers by regression analyses controlling by age and energy intake.",86b62a6e-dba7-4f55-83e1-c00f6882e411
13,methods13," These variables included Akkermansia, Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas, Bifidobacterium, Clostridia cluster XIVa, Lactobacillus group, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, glucose, triglycerides, Low density lipoprotein-high density lipoprotein (LDL-HDL) ratio, leptin, serum malondialdehyde (malondialdehyde (MDA)), (total antioxidant capacity) total antioxidant capacity (TAC), C-Reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, IL-10, IL-17, IL-8, IL-12, TNF-α, Phagocytosis granulocytes (%), Phagocytosis granulocytes and monocytes (%) and NK cell activity. When the distribution of variables was skewed (C reactive protein (CRP), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, IL-10, IL-17, IL-8, IL-12, TNF-α) the values were converted to their natural logarithm. Association of microbial groups with food groups, macronutrients and micronutrients were evaluated through linear regression analyses adjusting by age and energy.",57b91ccc-a1c5-4f8f-9209-b526e3416b83
14,methods14," The resulting data were plotted in a heatmap using the “pheatmat” function of the R program (version 3.5.1 for Windows). A Pearson correlation test was performed to elucidate closeness among dietary indices. This information was introduced in the program R, using the package “pheatmap,” to clusterize and plotting indices based on Euclidean distances. To test the association among dietary indices and previously reported health-beneficial dietary compounds, linear regression analyses were performed and plotted as forehead mentioned. To indicate statistical significance in the interpretation of results, the probability value of 0.05 was used.  3. Results The average score on dietary indices according to general characteristics and socio-economic status, lifestyle and health-related factors of the studied sample is presented in Table 1. Among all the variables examined, only significant differences were observed for the age and these were found in all the studied dietary indices.",e5e43bd3-39e7-4a02-b0eb-b4a8dbd0cbc6
15,methods15," Subjects over 65 years presented worse dietary scores than those in the group of 50–65 years. At the time of interpreting the results it should be taken into account that unlike the rest of the indices studied, in Dietary inflammatory index (DII) and EDietary inflammatory index (DII) a higher score is associated with a more pro-inflammatory diet. Both Dietary inflammatory index (DII) and DQI-I showed better scores in people with energy intake higher than 1994.8 kcal. EDietary inflammatory index (DII) score was found to be higher (worse dietary quality) as Body Mass Index (BMI) increases. A lower score in the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI), DQI-I and Mediterranean dietary indices (rMED, Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS)), associated with worse dietary quality, was found in those subjects with bad self-health perception. Therefore, age and energy intake have been introduced in further analyses carried out as a covariate.",658d3293-1ad7-49f4-8460-e8293394171d
16,methods16,"  A general description of the variables that are subsequently analyzed in the study according to age groups is shown in Table 2. The levels of the bacterial groups analyzed were in the range of those previously reported in similar populations and demonstrated the large inter-individual variability present in the human adult fecal microbiota. Significant differences were observed in most of the microbiological parameters analyzed according to age. Subjects over 65 years of age presented lower fecal levels of Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group, Clostridia cluster XIVa and Faecalibacterium, as well as all the short chain fatty acids determined. Blood parameters are within the normal physiological ranges and were similar between the groups evaluated except for malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-8, IL-12 and TNF-α, whose concentration is higher in subjects over 65 years of age.",a40f7b7f-c523-4fa6-9e04-4f18c9675a49
17,methods17,"  In order to analyze possible linear relationships among the different dietary indices scores and fecal microbial groups, a linear regression analysis was conducted and a heatmap was plotted (Figure 1). Lower scores on indices related to diet quality (Healthy Eating Index (HEI), AHealthy Eating Index (HEI), DQI-I), suggestive of an unhealthier diet, were associated with increased Akkermansia levels. While Dietary inflammatory index (DII), Healthy Eating Index (HEI), DQI-I and Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS) have shown potential as predictors of F. prausnitzii, which showed higher levels in those individuals with healthier diets, only AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) and Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS) were negatively associated with Lactobacillus levels. These results were further examined including other health-related parameters in the analysis (Table 3).",08ec4b60-9259-466a-abad-a3f31fa8d148
18,methods18," In relation to the production of short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s, higher scores in Healthy Eating Index (HEI), AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) and Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS) indices were positively associated with the formation of acetic, propionic and butyric acids. Furthermore, as expected, inflammatory indices (Dietary inflammatory index (DII), EDietary inflammatory index (DII)) were the best determinants of lipoperoxidation blood levels, while Mediterranean ones were the best identifiers of serum IL-8 concentrations.  To deepen into how dietary components may modulate gut microbiota and short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s, linear regressions models adjusting by age and energy intake were applied and β-coefficient values were plotted in the heatmap of Supplementary Figure S1. Sauces and dips seemed to be the most significant food group for determining Clostridia cluster XIVa and Lactobacillus groups.",beaad396-351f-4d7d-bc4c-67bae21fcc75
19,methods19," However, the consumption levels of this food group were very low in our sample (data not shown) so that this association should be considered with caution. F. prausnitzii showed a positive association with fruits, legumes and with fiber, whereas a negative association was found for saturated fats. short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s appeared to be mostly related to oils and fats, seafood, total polyphenols and saturated fats.  Heatmap showing Pearson´s correlation and clusterization among the different dietary indices is presented in Figure 2. Here, inflammatory indices revealed to be closer between them, forming the first cluster while the others integrate the second cluster. At the same time, Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) grouped more closely with DQI-I and then with rMED and Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS).",24fcf21d-8ca9-4a02-8c8f-ed89b95b6864
20,methods20,"  To elucidate the relationship of dietary indices scores with the consumption of dietary compounds with reported anti-inflammatory and health-protective effects in the literature, a new linear regression analysis was performed adjusting by age and energy and a heatmap was plotted with the results (Figure 3). Dietary inflammatory index (DII) showed more negative correlation with vitamins, fiber, glucosinolates and isothiocyanates than EDietary inflammatory index (DII). All indices were associated with total polyphenols and ORAC. Except for rMED, indices had a significant correlation with flavonols, DHA, lutein + zeaxanthin, carotenoids, insoluble fiber and pectin. Glucosinolates and isothiocyanates did not show a significant association with the Mediterranean indices. In general, splitting indices into inflammatory, Mediterranean and diet quality ones, heatmap revealed similar patterns of association for the indices within each group.",d0eae6c6-a724-49ab-a355-088c931d680f
21,methods21," With the exception of flavones, all evaluated compounds revealed a negative association with inflammatory indices but positive with the Mediterranean and diet quality indices.  4. Discussion In recent years, dietary indices have been a major step towards addressing the diet-health binomial from a global perspective. While tailored to different populations and constructed for specific purposes, a high degree of similarity can be observed among some of them. To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the usefulness of dietary indices as predictors of human gut microbiota, the production of fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s and the concentration in blood of different parameters related to the immune and inflammatory status, in a sample of middle-aged and elderly subjects without diagnosed pathology. As it has been previously proposed by other authors, for some of the indices included in the study, our data showed the existence of differences according to age.",17885ad4-743e-4857-9099-d890d682641b
22,methods22," Furthermore, changes in the levels of some bacterial groups such as Akkermansia [44] or butyrate-producing bacteria, mainly F. prausnitzii [45,46], have been reported in aged individuals. Therefore, the factor “age” has been introduced in the models as a covariate in order to improve the interpretation of results.  Limitations in the use of dietary indices need to be also taken into account. Dietary inflammatory index (DII) encompasses a total of 45 components, of which 35 were evaluated in this sample. The effects of lacking 10 components in the scoring system may be attenuated by the own nature of the index and the fact of having a sample that does not show extreme values of consumption for any component. Moreover, nutritional supplements, weighted in other versions of EDietary inflammatory index (DII) to compute the final score, were not included here.",25a2487c-bf26-4d60-b9fd-f48b0c39659a
23,methods23," Some dietary indices such as EDietary inflammatory index (DII), Healthy Eating Index (HEI) or AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) were developed in the context of almost fully “westernized” societies, which could drive to an underrating or overrating in diets of populations with mixed diets (Mediterranean, African, etc.). Indeed, in our sample, the component “Trans Fat” that is evaluated in the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI), showed very low values while in typical EEUU diet is probably highly present. This may entail a loss of power in the accuracy of the prediction of our scores. Furthermore, DQI-I incorporates dietary variety, adequacy and moderation as a quality criterion. Although all these parameters have been included, the accuracy of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to provide an accurate measurement of variety may be one of the limitations of this work. One of the main difficulties arises in the capacity of the indices to classify the subjects under study.",12847eee-8485-4c89-8719-7643ee9d9a57
24,methods24," In this sense, the scores from dietary quality indices showed low variability inter subject, with almost the whole sample obtaining scores indicative of poor or average diet quality for DQI-I, Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI). Thus, we propose these indices as the worse in differentiating the poor-quality Mediterranean-style diet from a middle-age-elderly sample. On the other hand, indices related to adherence to a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern have presented a wide range of scores in the sample, ranging from 2–12 points and 1–7 for rMED and Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS), respectively.  Based on the data obtained, the identification of the best tool to predict the composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota as a function of diet, is a difficult task.",118d2faa-f4ac-4ae8-b6a9-a9103e3d74c0
25,methods25," We considered that in the present study, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) and DQI-I resulted likely inappropriate as predictor variables of differences between different microbiota as poor diets, that are different but score similarly, may mask trends associated to specific dietary constituents [47]. Interestingly, we found decreased levels of the mucin degrading Akkermansia in better scoring individuals compared to increased levels of Akkermansia in the worse ones, mainly influenced by vegetable consumption (data not shown). When vegetables are included at significant levels in diet, fiber consumption increases, which could promote the rise of some fiber-degrading species at the expense of other microorganisms such Akkermansia [48]. This could contrast with the fact that the presence of Akkermansia has been associated with healthy intestine and its abundance has been inversely correlated to several disease states [49,50,51,52,53,54].",75b52474-f75f-45cf-9944-731f36518ea3
26,methods26," We propose Mediterranean indices and more precisely Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS), as the most accurate and best predictor in our population sample. Probably, socio-geographical reasons do Mediterranean indices the most suitable ones to measure the quality of diet in the sample and therefore, to predict microbiological and immunological variables. Also, some dietary indices related with inflammation (Dietary inflammatory index (DII)), quality of diet (Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and DQI-I) and adherence to the Mediterranean-diet (Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS)) seem to be predictors of F. prausnitzii fecal levels, which were higher in individuals with healthier diets. F. prausnitzii, a member of the commensal microbiota, has been related with intestinal health and gut homeostasis [55]. Several studies highlight the anti-inflammatory properties of F.",a02a313b-08d9-42f9-a570-69843c89c785
27,methods27," prausnitzii and its ability for upregulating T cell production and reducing IL-8 levels by blocking the NF-kB activation [56,57]. F. prausnitzii is a member of Clostridium cluster IV, one of the main producers of butyrate in the human colon [58] during fermentation of nondigestible polysaccharides such as dietary fiber. Butyrate plays several pleiotropic effects on host physiology and enhances the protection against pathogen invasion [59,60]. Remarkably, Faecalibacterium was found to be at high abundance in an Irish elderly sample [61] whereas some studies showed decreased levels of F. prausnitzii in centenarians as compared with younger adults [62]. Further studies are needed to determine the role of these bacteria in the intestinal microbiota of elderly populations.",ce231ba3-80ae-4dbb-b801-7efcc389430c
28,methods28,"  The indices AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) and Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS) (related to quality of diet and adherence to Mediterranean diet, respectively) were negatively associated with intestinal Lactobacillus levels. Increased Lactobacillus levels have been correlated with a higher PUFA/SFA ratio intake, probably mediated by changes in bile acid secretion and composition [23,63,64]. Extra virgin olive oil is an important component of Mediterranean diet and is a source of unsaturated fatty acids that can be metabolized by some intestinal Lactobacillus species [65,66,67]. Dietary indices used in the present work add from 0 to different positive numerical values to the formula relating dietary fats, as depending on the type and amount of fat consumed (calculated as a percentage of total energy intake).",cb0d0626-3d96-40c5-9324-8aec5ae88cf5
29,methods29," Therefore, as higher scores in dietary indices are generally accompanied in the general population by lower consumption of all type of fats (correlation values of “Lipids” with AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) and Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS) of −0.154 and −0.149, respectively), this could provide a rationale to the inverse association found by us between scores for AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) and Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MMDS) and fecal levels of Lactobacillus. In this regard, we recently reported increased levels of the Lactobacillus group in Spanish adults displaying altered profiles of serum free fatty acids, which were accompanied by subclinical metabolic alterations [68].  Regarding the fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s evaluated in our sample, acetic and propionic acids, correlated positively with heathier dietary scores for most of the indices.",78da1582-8850-4435-8ff7-5d7a95b76371
30,methods30," Microorganisms colonizing the gastrointestinal tract can participate in beneficial interactions within the intestinal ecological niche, as modulated by external factors such as diet. This is the case of the increase of the intestinal butyrate production by cross-feeding mechanisms. In cross-feeding, fiber-degrading bacteria can produce acetate as an end-product of fermentation, which is then metabolized by other members of the intestinal microbiota, as those belonging to Clostridia clusters XIVa and IV, to produce butyrate as an end-product of fermentation [51]. Both, bacteria and short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s contribute to cell expansion, immunosuppressive functions and overall intestinal homeostasis. Therefore, better dietary scores could be related with an enhanced short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s production in the gut [23].",c8884dba-edaa-44f4-a508-3a788eb3a98f
31,methods31,"  Inflammatory indices have been identified as good predictors of inflammation variables such as C reactive protein (CRP), IL-6 and TNF-α receptor 2 [12,13,14,69,70]. malondialdehyde (MDA) is considered an oxidative stress biomarker that reflects levels of lipoperoxidation in blood. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports relating dietary inflammatory indices and malondialdehyde (MDA). The lower detection of IL-8 in those individuals in the present work showing better scores on the indices related with the adherence to the Mediterranean diet may be partially explained by the increased levels of the anti-inflammatory bacterium F. prausnitzii [71] in such individuals. This bacterium was able to block the production of the inflammatory interleukin IL-8 in Crohn disease patients and in a murine colitis model [72].  5.",e3aaea7a-5020-43fe-9e82-cb87e4b4c090
32,methods32," Conclusions The associations found among intestinal bacterial groups, short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s, blood biomarkers and dietary indices are indirectly reflecting how these variables are influenced by the specific components or food groups scoring in each index. When trying to discern differences among indices by clustering them, they are split in 3 main classes: inflammatory, diet quality and adherence to Mediterranean diet. The methodologies followed to construct them, the population they target and the scoring criteria define their nature and the way they correlated with others. The extension of the usefulness of dietary indices may shed some light into how to modulate gut microbiota focusing on dietary patterns. ",6b89138d-00de-4165-890a-4f4d42ed15ff
