0,background0," In recent decades, the prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes is increasing. One of the major complications of diabetes is diabetic nephropathy (DN), so it is important to find a way that can delay or control the onset of DN. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the relationship between the Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean diet (MED)) and the odds of DN. ",e0f571e4-0f2b-4717-9d41-9346c4b79c5a
1,methods0," This case–control study was performed among 210 women (30–65 years) who were referred to the Kowsar Diabetes Clinic in Semnan, Iran. Biochemical variables and anthropometric measurements were assessed. The food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) was used to calculate dietary intakes. Data from dietary intakes based on the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were used to evaluate the Mediterranean diet (MED) score. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations.

2,analysis0," The normality of the quantitative variables was evaluated using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Quantitative variables including age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were compared between cases, and controls were described as mean ± standard deviation (SD), using the independent t-test, and for categorical variables, frequency (%) was used. One-way ANOVA and chi-square tests were used for quantitative variables and categorical variables across the low adherence and high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) between cases and controls and to characterize the distribution of the qualitative variables across the low adherence and high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) between cases and controls.  Logistic regression was used to determine the association between food groups and odds of DN. Variables including body mass index (BMI), A1C, total energy intake, and Mediterranean diet (MED) were controlled in adjusted models.

14,discussion0," We investigate the association between Mediterranean diet (MED) and DN among women. This is the first study that investigates the relationship between Mediterranean diet (MED) and DN among women. Based on our results, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) leads to lower odds of DN.  According to our results, adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) has reduced the odds of DN, and this association was significant. Our results are consistent with those of other studies. One study showed that more adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) could decrease the likelihood of DN (36). A cohort study showed that the Mediterranean diet (MED) did not affect DN after 6 years of follow-up (37). Adherence to healthy diets like the Mediterranean diet (MED) has a positive effect on cardiometabolic risk factors like blood pressure (38–40), blood glucose level (41, 42), and lipid profile (43, 44).",a1820f11-a932-4c61-bf3c-2c5315ade826
15,discussion1," A study has revealed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) can reduce the odds of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) (45). Other mechanisms by which adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) affect DN is the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant profile of the Mediterranean diet (MED) (46, 47). Patients who adhered to the Mediterranean diet (MED) had lower HbA1c levels, and their blood sugar levels were controlled (36, 41, 42, 48). Some studies have revealed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) can decrease blood pressure (49, 50) and overweight (48, 51, 52). So it appears that adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) may reduce the odds of DN.  According to previous studies, a high intake of fruits and vegetables has positive effects on T2D, and these effects are because of their fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, and phytochemical contents (53, 54).",7f02652e-afa5-4a6e-a8a2-c71a47ebb6cc
16,discussion2," Consumption of fruit and vegetables can reduce adiposity and weight gain, which are the risk factors for DN and diabetes (54).  Our results showed that consumption of grains is higher in the group with low adherence, and the consumption of meat is higher in the group with high adherence. It could be because participants with low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) do not have a good food pattern, so grain consumption in these participants is higher than that in the group with high adherence. Also, in the group with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED), due to the better food pattern, meat consumption in these participants is higher than that in the group with low adherence.  According to our results, by consuming MUFA and SAFA, the odds of DN were increased. Some studies showed that high consumption of MUFA can reduce the FBS and HbA1c levels (55, 56).",57d34d2c-3df8-454c-ab8a-b057696349cd
17,discussion3," In patients with diabetes, consumption of SAFA resulted in albuminuria (57–59), and a lower intake of SAFA was associated with the better renal function (57). SAFA can increase hs-CRP and pro-inflammatory markers that contribute to high albuminuria (59). In terms of MUFA, some studies showed that MUFA is associated with the onset of T2D and its complications (60–64). By consuming fatty acids, the composition of fatty acids in the cell membrane will be changed and affect membrane fluidity, cell signaling, and gene expressions (53). Consistent with our results and the results of some studies, one study demonstrated that MUFA intake was not associated with improvements in renal function (57).  It has been shown that lower consumption or withdrawal of red meat from the diet has a good effect on renal function and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in people with DN (65), and this effect may be related to different amino acids like arginine and glycine (65).",dc96d3fc-313e-48d5-b43b-5fde94f50442
18,discussion4,"  One of the important components of the Mediterranean diet (MED) is legumes. Legumes as a rich source of dietary fiber can improve insulin resistance and reduce the risk of obesity, T2D, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (66–70). The alpha-amylase inhibitory peptide as a component of legumes can reduce the metabolism of carbohydrates and control the postprandial glycemic response (71).  According to studies, consuming fish can improve renal hemodynamics, reduce proteinuria, control arterial blood pressure, and slow renal dysfunction (72–75). Consistent with our results, the studies showed that omega-3 fatty acids have a significant effect on DN (76). Omega-3 fatty acids can reduce inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory signaling like toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (77).  There are some strengths in this study; our study population was from the same location in the same period, and we used an food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that was validated and reliable.",014dcbfb-b840-4888-a98b-bb9ab342d53c
19,discussion5," Despite strengths, this study has some limitations. Our population consists of only women, and because of this, we cannot generalize our results to society. The urine sample for albumin alone without simultaneously measuring urine creatinine (Cr) is susceptible to false-negative and false-positive determinations as a result of variations in the urine concentration due to hydration. Another limitation is not using the original full scale with nine items. It is important that studies with a larger sample size investigate this association.  Conclusion  We observed that women with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) and high consumption of grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, and fish had lower odds of DN through the mentioned mechanisms. However, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.",3c1f38ee-cf4e-467d-b5b8-d75e098b7b26
