0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Data Collection  A web survey was conducted between January and October 2021. Data were collected anonymously from an online questionnaire prepared on SurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.com, accessed on 11 May 2022) [17], which is a free tool with an easy-to-use web interface. To enroll as many participants as possible, the questionnaire was disseminated and shared with a link among personal and non-personal contacts using advertisements in local media, social media, and on websites. Before starting the questionnaire, participants were asked to read the project information sheet, which contained an explanation of the study’s objectives. Then, participants were asked to complete a brief questionnaire focused on sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, marital status, education level, weight, and height), and two validated questionnaires suitable for collecting information on ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption and MD adherence.",0478f8af-7bfc-4c2b-bf3e-4efa0d015c1a
1,methods1," Marital status was categorized as unmarried/single and married/partner, and education level was categorized as primary/secondary school, high school, and university. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters for each participant. Participants were classified as overweight if their Body mass index (BMI) ranged between 25–30 kg/m2, and obese if their Body mass index (BMI) was 30 kg/m2 or more. This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Florence, Florence, Italy [n 199/2022, protocol 11917]. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.  2.2.",398a5a1a-66ce-4758-bb83-6b8dba167a53
2,methods2," NOVA Food Frequency Questionnaire (NOVA Food Frequency Questionnaire (NFFQ))  The NOVA Food Frequency Questionnaire (NFFQ) is a validated questionnaire specifically designed to estimate food intake according to NOVA groups in the Italian adult population [18]. The questionnaire includes 94 items divided into nine categories: (1) fruits and nuts; (2) vegetables and legumes; (3) cereals and tubers; (4) meat and fish; (5) milk, dairy products, and eggs; (6) oils, fats, and seasonings; (7) sweets and sweeteners; (8) beverages; and (9) other. For each item, the participant should indicate the frequency of consumption and usual portion size considering the diet in a typical month over the past 12 months.",cf99974e-e4b4-4ff9-a2eb-f81599987e70
3,methods3," Answers correspond to one out of ten options: (1) “never or less than once a month”; (2) “one to three times a month”’; (3) “once a week”; (4) “twice a week”; (5) “three times a week”; (6) “four times a week”; (7) “five times a week”; (8) “six times a week”; (9) “every day”; and (10) “if every day, how many times a day?”. Because all 94 items included in the FFQ were pre-categorized according to the NOVA classification, each food fell into one of the following categories: unprocessed and minimally processed food or beverage (minimally processed food or beverage (MPF)); processed culinary ingredients (processed culinary ingredients (PCI)); processed food or beverage (PF); and ultra processed foods (UPF).  When processing the NOVA Food Frequency Questionnaire (NFFQ) data, the amount of food consumed is calculated in grams per week and in grams per day for each food item and category.",4dfa97b7-58d2-43e2-a032-f5c42afb33d3
4,methods4," Then, the proportion of minimally processed food or beverage (MPF), processed culinary ingredients (PCI), PF, and ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet is determined by calculating the weight ratio. As previously reported, the weight ratio is considered rather than the energy ratio because it allows for a better accounting for processed foods that do not provide energy (e.g., artificially sweetened beverages) and non-nutritional factors related to food processing (e.g., newly formed contaminants, food additives and alterations in the structure of raw foods) [18]. Finally, because processed culinary ingredients (PCI) products are not intended to be consumed alone as food, but are supposed to be used to prepare and season other foods, they are grouped with PF.  2.3. The Medi-Lite Adherence Score  Adherence to MD was assessed through the validated Medi-Lite questionnaire, developed by Sofi et al. [19].",7a698f94-4a1d-49ac-a815-a0b0fdb2045e
5,methods5," The questionnaire includes nine domains, based on daily and/or weekly consumption of fruits, vegetables, cereals, legumes, fish, meat and meat products, dairy products, alcohol, and olive oil. For fruits, vegetables, cereals, legumes, and fish (typical foods of MD), two points are given for the highest consumption category, one point for the medium category and zero points for the lowest category. For olive oil, two points are given for regular use, one for frequent use, and zero for occasional use. On the other hand, for meat and meat products and dairy products (foods not typical of MD), two points are given for the lowest category of consumption, one point for the medium category, and zero for the highest category. Finally, for alcohol consumption, two points are given for the medium category, one for the lowest category, and zero for the highest category. The questionnaire score ranges from 0 to 18, where the highest value corresponds to the highest adherence to the MD.  2.4.",f62c7206-2fc7-49f3-be7d-077328cf7a49
6,methods6," Statistical Analysis  Descriptive statistics were used to analyze and report the data. Results were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD), median and range, or geometric mean with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), as appropriate. Categorical variables were presented in terms of frequencies and percentages. The Mann—Whitney test was used for comparisons between women and men, while the Chi—Square test was used to test for proportions. The correlation between the percentage of ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet and the Medi-Lite score was estimated using the Spearman (R) test.",6610f80e-3cb2-4e7c-9948-c785004c414e
7,methods7,"  The possible relationship between ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption and MD adherence was analyzed by grouping the participants according to ultra processed foods (UPF) contribution in the diet (1st tertile ≤ 10%; 2nd tertile = 10–19%; 3rd tertile ≥ 19%), and by MD adherence into low (1st tertile = Medi-Lite score < 9), moderate (2nd tertile = Medi-Lite score between 9 and 11), and high (3rd tertile = Medi-Lite score > 11) adherence. Then, a general linear model adjusted for age, sex, Body mass index (BMI), education level, marital status, and daily food intake was conducted to compare dietary habits according to the percentage of ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet, and daily ultra processed foods (UPF) intake according to the MD adherence. Since these tests assume normal data distribution, non-distributed data were transformed into logs and further analyses were performed with the processed data.",09f71c3e-40d1-42ab-b019-c6e2abb85fdb
8,methods8," However, to facilitate interpretation, the log data were again converted to the original scale (antilog) and presented as geometric means with 95% CIs.  Finally, to evaluate the influence of individual ultra processed foods (UPF) on Medi-Lite score, a linear regression model was performed, and results were expressed as regression coefficient (b) ± SE. The b coefficient estimated in the linear regression analysis indicates the expected mean change in Medi-Lite score associated with 1-unit change in the independent variables. p-values  < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The statistical package IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh, version 28.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used.  3. Results  A total of 670 participants (70.4% women) with a mean age of 35.8 years were included in the analysis. Table 1 reports their socio-demographic characteristics, according to sex. Overall, the study population was highly educated and more than half of the participants were single.",51d343fb-2dc3-4cab-a176-706d441f13d5
9,methods9," Compared to men, women had significantly (p < 0.001) lower Body mass index (BMI) and lower prevalence of overweight and obesity (21.1% vs. 40.9%). No significant differences were observed for education level or marital status.  3.1. Nova Food Frequency Questionnaire (NOVA Food Frequency Questionnaire (NFFQ))  The percentage of ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet was 16.4 ± 10.4%, with significantly (p < 0.05) lower values in women (15.6 ± 10%) than in men (18.2 ± 11.1%). No significant differences were observed according to Body mass index (BMI), education level, and marital status. In terms of daily ultra processed foods (UPF) intake, the percentage of ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet corresponded to 299.0 ± 233.5 g/day in the total sample, 285.5 ± 231.0 g/day in women, and 331.2 ± 236.7 g/day in men. The food categories that contributed most to this amount were ready-to-heat meals or pre-packaged bread, bread alternatives, pizza, and frozen potato chips (24.",7836ec80-4be4-4934-9664-3738f47ac027

The contribution of individual ultra processed foods (UPF), according to sex, is reported in Supplementary Table S1. Significant differences between sex were observed for ready-to-heat pasta/gnocchi, sausages and other reconstituted meat and fish products, and for alcoholic beverages (e.g., liquor), with higher percentages in men than in women.  Food consumption (g/day) according to the percentage of ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet is reported in Table 2.",ff238d77-134e-43d6-ac5d-a554f3659823
11,methods11," After adjustment for possible confounding factors such as age, sex, and daily food intake, participants in the highest ultra processed foods (UPF) tertile showed a lower consumption of fruits, nuts, and vegetables than those in the first tertile, and a higher consumption of cereals and tubers, fats and seasonings, sweets and sweeteners, beverages, and dairy substitutes. For meat and fish, the total consumption did not differ significantly between groups, but subjects in the highest ultra processed foods (UPF) tertile consumed more meat and poultry and less fish and seafood. A similar trend was observed for beverages, with subjects in the highest ultra processed foods (UPF) tertile reporting a higher consumption of soft and energy drinks, and subjects in the lowest ultra processed foods (UPF) tertile reporting a higher consumption of tea and coffee. No significant differences were observed for milk and dairy products, except for cheese.  3.2.",5f9425d7-9d36-4355-b566-0b43c668f9ee
12,methods12," Medi-Lite and ultra processed foods (UPF) Consumption  Regarding MD adherence, the mean Medi-Lite score was 10.3 ± 2.5, with no significant differences (p = 0.151) between women (10.4 ± 2.4) and men (10 ± 2.6). Correlation analyses showed a significant inverse association between the Medi-Lite score and percentage of ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet (R = −0.35; p < 0.001) (Figure 1), which was confirmed when women (R = −0.35; p < 0.001) and men (R = −0.36; p < 0.001) were analyzed separately.  To better explore the possible relationship between MD adherence and ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption, three adherence groups to MD (low, moderate, and high) were considered, and the mean percentage of total ultra processed foods (UPF) in these groups was calculated. As showed in Figure 2, subjects with low MD adherence had a significantly higher contribution of ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet (22.2 ± 10.3%) than those with moderate (16.2 ± 9.8%) and high (12.6 ± 9.",b42dee1d-4f91-43f2-95f2-65c3e8fd71af
13,methods13,"5%) adherence. This result was confirmed when women and men were analyzed separately.  Regarding individual ultra processed foods (UPF), their intake in terms of daily amounts was significantly higher in subjects with a low MD adherence for most of the items considered, with the largest differences observed for pre-packaged biscuits and other sweets, soft and energy drinks, sausages and other reconstituted meat products, and pre-packaged bread and bread alternatives (Table 3).  Finally, to evaluate the possible influence of individual ultra processed foods (UPF) on Medi-Lite score, a linear regression analysis with the Medi-Lite score as a dependent variable was performed.",84a50f2a-815b-4793-8bbb-a904eaa0de58
14,methods14," As shown in Table 4, sausages and other reconstituted meat products, pre-packaged pizza, potatoes, biscuits and sweets, and soft and energy drinks were revealed to influence the Medi-Lite score significantly and negatively after an adjustment for age, sex, Body mass index (BMI), education level, marital status, and the total food consumed.  4. Discussion  In this study we used a validated questionnaire to assess ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption in relation to an adherence to the MD in a group of adult subjects living in the Mediterranean area. In our study group, we observed that subjects reporting a low adherence to MD were also those showing a higher consumption of ultra processed foods (UPF) in their diet. In fact, an increased intake of ultra processed foods (UPF) was associated with a significantly lower intake of some typical products of the MD such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and fish, and a higher intake of meat, fats, seasonings, and sugary products.",7942851c-d85a-4d35-ad3e-aac356a1c269
15,methods15," Furthermore, we observed that some ultra processed foods (UPF), such as sausages and other reconstituted meat products, pre-packaged pizza, frozen potato chips, industrial biscuits and sweets, and soft and energy drinks, were shown to influence the adherence score to MD.  Since Monteiro and colleagues proposed the NOVA classification to identify the level of food processing [20], several studies have investigated ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption and its effects on health. A meta-analysis by our group recently reported a significantly increased risk of the occurrence of major chronic diseases in association with a higher ultra processed foods (UPF) intake [4]. In terms of daily ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption, a significant increase has been reported worldwide in recent decades. Data from most of the industrialized countries show a range of percentages from 20–50% of ultra processed foods (UPF) present in the diet of the general population.",f813091f-c916-4f97-b055-1fe4fbd2db59
16,methods16," To date, countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea have shown a lower ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption in contrast to Western countries, but the intake of ultra processed foods (UPF) is increasing rapidly, leading to a gradual displacement of long-established diets. In our sample population, the percentage of ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet was 16% of the total energy intake, which corresponded to a daily consumption of almost 300 g of ultra processed foods (UPF). These values are slightly higher than those reported also in Italy but in the Southern part by Bonaccio et al., (10% of total energy intake, corresponding to 182 g/day) [13] but substantially lower compared with other countries such as Spain (24%) [21], France (36%) [22], the United Kingdom (57%) [23], or the United States (58%) [24].",7edf69af-4f0b-4117-853b-87a07a6963c9
17,methods17," Such a difference among countries, in particular between Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries, let us to hypothesize that the traditional dietary patterns of the Mediterranean basin could have influenced the findings.  Currently, a higher adherence to MD is known to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular diseases, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, overall cancer incidence, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes [8]. In line with the literature [11,12,13,14,15], the results obtained from this study confirm a significant inverse association between ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption and adherence to MD, highlighting that higher ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption is associated with a lower adherence to MD. This could be explained as a nutritional transition from fresh meals and dishes that are part of the traditional cuisine towards a higher intake of ready-to consume and hyper-palatable food and beverages products.",6ca13b54-c4c8-498c-963c-f926f6c25cd2
18,methods18," Indeed, an impact on the intake of some of the foods known to be the basis of MD was reported due to the high ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption. Specifically, participants with greater ultra processed foods (UPF) intake reported a lower intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and fish, and a higher intake of cereals, fats, meat, seasonings, and sweets in their diets, in contrast to participants with a lower ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption. Similar findings were found in other studies of Mediterranean populations, such as Spain [11] or France [22]. Furthermore, ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption has not only impacted eating habits, but also beverage quality, with a higher consumption of soft and energy beverages and a lower consumption of water, tea, and coffee in participants with a greater ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption [14,15,22].",cdd5b324-8ddd-4126-8fbe-bf6b79aa1596
19,methods19,"  To better understand the association between ultra processed foods (UPF) intake and MD adherence in our study population, we also investigated the possible influence of individual ultra processed foods (UPF) on the MD adherence score, observing that the consumption of sugary products, processed meats, soft and energy drinks, and pre-packaged potatoes and pizza negatively influenced the MD adherence score. Interestingly, most of these foods were major contributors to ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption in our population and are present in all countries of the world, supporting the hypothesis of a nutritional transition from traditional diets such as MD to Westernized dietary patterns due to an increased ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption. There is an urgent need to raise awareness on the negative health effects of excessive ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption and new public health strategies to prevent the progressive loss of traditional diets.",ed4aae56-75bc-4b9f-a5b3-e4f992fa941d
20,methods20,"  The present study has several limitations that deserve discussion. First, the cross-sectional design does not allow us to establish any cause-effect relationship. Prospective cohort studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings. Second, the use of self-administered online questionnaires may have led to recall bias and misclassification. The emergency response due to the COVID-19 pandemic did not allow us to conduct another type of study with a stronger statistical power and less biases. On the other hand, several strengths are present since a validated questionnaire specifically designed to estimate food intake according to NOVA classification was used, avoiding the misclassification of foods into ultra processed foods (UPF) categories. Furthermore, the variables used in the main analyses included the proportion, by weight, of ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet.",327eca28-e11a-4299-a184-9e319e3e7a51
21,methods21," This approach is more appropriate than the use of energy proportion, as it takes a better account of non-nutritional factors pertaining to food processing (e.g., neo-formed contaminants, additives, alterations to the structure of raw foods).  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, in our study population of middle-aged Italian adults we were able to observe an inverse relation between adherence to MD and ultra processed foods (UPF) consumption. In considering the over-consumption of ultra processed foods (UPF) as an important risk factor for non-communicable diseases, overweightness and obesity, our results reinforce the importance of public health strategies to improve the population’s health by promoting MD and limiting the intake of ultra processed foods (UPF), which is also proposed by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)).",38ec64f0-3bb3-4d7f-a8a4-362dd41d4f53
22,methods22," Examples of such strategies could be taxation, the regulation of marketing, or the control of food labeling standards, some of which have already shown good results [25,26]. Moreover, particular attention should be paid to the consumption of specific ultra processed foods (UPF) (sugary products, processed meats, soft and energy beverages, pre-packaged potatoes, and pizza) due to their association with a low adherence to MD.
