0,background0, Exposure to prenatal bisphenol A (bisphenol A (BPA)) and Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) has been linked to metabolic risk in child offspring. It remains unclear if independent and interactive effects persist in adolescence. ,f9e723cc-ef2b-43ab-bef7-6cb428ded9e4
1,methods0," We examined prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) on adolescent offspring metabolic syndrome risk score (metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS)) and 8-isoprostane (8-iso), a biomarker of oxidative stress. Data from maternal-adolescent dyads from a Mexico City cohort were utilized, including trimester-specific prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) from spot urine and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) from food frequency questionnaires. Offspring socio-demographic data and biomarkers to estimate metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) and 8-iso were obtained during peri-adolescence.   Study population  The analytic study sample included mother-adolescent dyads from two sequential birth cohorts of the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT)) study (31). Between 1997 and 2004, mothers were recruited from hospitals serving low-to-moderate income populations living in Mexico City.",475e0c99-7a7a-4408-b6d8-9983c1ab511d
2,methods1," Mothers were recruited during their trimester one prenatal visit where maternal height, weight, urinary samples, and questionnaires on food intake and sociodemographic data were collected at each trimester of pregnancy.  Between 2010 and 2012, 250 adolescent offspring participated in a follow-up visit. Measures collected included anthropometry, urine and blood samples for biomarker assessment, food frequency questionnaires, physician-assessed pubertal status, self-reported physical activity, and sociodemographic characteristics. We present a range of sample sizes in the present study depending on data availability. The final analytic sample sizes used for regression analyses varied by trimester based on the availability of exposure, outcome, and confounding variables included in the fully adjusted regression models. Therefore, sample sizes for the metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) outcome at trimesters one, two, and three samples were N = 189, N = 190, and N = 206, respectively.",92e3482d-de9b-4b78-afd5-3452c596bafc
3,methods2," While for the 8-isoprostane outcome, the sample sizes for trimesters one, two, and three were N = 195, N = 185, and N = 209, respectively. See Figure 1 for the study flow chart.  Figure 1 Study flow chart. *Sample sizes from fully adjusted regression models.  The Mexico National Institute of Public Health Research, Ethics, and Biosafety Committees (approval number 1377) approved all research protocols and procedures, and all participants provided informed consent.  Exposure biomarker assessment of maternal urinary bisphenol A  Total (free + glucuronidated) bisphenol A (BPA) was measured from spot urine samples collected from mothers during each trimester of pregnancy using isotope dilution–liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (ID–LC-MS/MS) at NSF International (Ann Arbor, MI, USA).",06c638c4-ec7d-4761-ac8d-2329b2e481c1
4,methods3," We chose to measure total bisphenol A (BPA) to be consistent with gold standards established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)); methods were developed based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocols as previously described elsewhere (32). During the measurement of prenatal maternal urinary bisphenol A (BPA), urinary specific gravity (SG) was also measured using a handheld digital refractometer (ATAGO Company Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to adjust for variability in urine output and concentration between study participants. SG-corrected prenatal maternal urinary bisphenol A (BPA) concentrations were calculated for use in specific statistical analyses.  Adolescent urinary bisphenol A (BPA) concentrations were assessed at NSF International in Ann Arbor, MI, using the same ID-LC-MS/MS method (32) to measure prenatal maternal bisphenol A (BPA).",40bd523b-7a5a-4299-89d6-ce54af7fc2c7
5,methods4,"  Mediterranean diet score assessment  During each trimester of pregnancy, mothers completed an interview-administered food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)). Intake information was collected by a trained interviewer using a >100 item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), allowing participants to provide information on typical consumption habits in the past month. The questionnaire used the methodology from Willett (33) and was translated and validated for use among Mexican Spanish-speaking women of reproductive age (33, 34). Participating mothers were required to provide information regarding how often, on average, they consumed each food of standard portion size. Each question had a total of nine response options, including: <1 time/month or never, 1–3 times/month, 1 time/week, 2–4 times/week, 5–6 times/week, 1 time/day, 2–3 times/day, 4–5 times/day, and ≥6 times/day.",191aa795-7341-4d23-9db8-972aa9444c07
6,methods5," Raw response frequency of consumption values (1–9) was transformed into semi-continuous variables representing servings per day.  The Trichopoulou Mediterranean diet score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) method was used to assess maternal Mediterranean diet adherence in the present study (35). Prior to coding, we used data from food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s and compiled similar foods into food group categories used by the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) method. Mediterranean diet scoring was first proposed by Trichopoulou (36–38). This original Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) uses scoring criteria from 0-9 points, with more points indicating higher adherence to the diet.",7a87718b-648a-4fb7-9a5e-73efb6fde222
7,methods6," To compute trimester-specific Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) for each Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) mother in this study, the median daily intake (grams) was calculated for each of the eight food groups: fish, legumes, fruits & nuts, vegetables, whole grains, meat, poultry, and dairy. For “beneficial” foods from the following categories: fish, legumes, fruits & nuts, vegetables, and cereal (assumed to be whole grain), participants with consumption below the median were assigned a value of 0, and those with consumption that was at or above the median were assigned a value of 1. For foods that were considered “detrimental” from the following categories: meat, poultry, and dairy (assumed to be whole fat), participants with consumption that was below the median were assigned a value of 1, while those with consumption at or above the median were assigned a value of 0.",43b73781-14e9-47b6-9a32-c11ffa87708e
8,methods7," Individuals received an additional point if their daily alcohol consumption was within a moderate range (2–25 g/day for women) (36). However, the alcohol consumption category was excluded since alcohol intake was negligible among pregnant women and adolescents in the present study. Thus, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in the present study ranged from 0 to 8 points (Supplementary Table 3). Adolescents completed food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s, similar to those their mothers completed during pregnancy (39), and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was calculated as described above.  Adolescent metabolic syndrome risk score and oxidative stress  During the 2010–2012 adolescent study visit, fasting glucose, total group triglycerides (TGGs), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured using a biochemical analyzer (Cobas Mira Plus, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland).",cb2fcb1f-67fa-438d-956c-bdded09c6bad
9,methods8," Following venous blood collection, serum aliquots were frozen at –80°C and shipped from the Mexico National Institute of Public Health to the Michigan Diabetes Research Center Chemistry Lab for analysis. Serum leptin was measured via RIA (Millipore) and Insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1) by chemiluminescence immunoassay (Immulite 1000).  Adolescent anthropometry measured by trained research staff included height, weight, and waist circumference. Seated blood pressure measurements were taken in duplicate, and average systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) levels were used in the analyses. Fasting venous blood samples were used to estimate serum hormone levels (leptin and IGF-1). Adolescent MetS risk was assessed via metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) previously validated for classifying MetS among adolescents (40).",bf5f0376-66f9-4174-bb68-c09d0aae8854
10,methods9," Based on the present sample, sex-specific z-scores were calculated for four adolescent variables: waist circumference, fasting glucose, fasting lipids (TGG/HDL-C), and average blood pressure [(systolic blood pressure (SBP) + diastolic blood pressure (DBP))/2]. The sex-specific metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) was calculated by averaging the four z-scores.  Serum samples were utilized to quantify 8-iso. Samples were stored at –80°C with 0.005% butylated hydroxytoluene to prevent oxidation during storage, then transferred on dry ice to Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The 8-isoprostane analyses were conducted via a competitive enzyme immunoassay (enzyme immunoassay (EIA)) kit (No. 516351), with a sensitivity of 2.7 pg/mL and intra-assay coefficient variability of 9.5%.",6a5bd231-e41b-4d8a-a341-22f980cf7250
11,methods10," The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences initiative, Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress Study, determined that F2-isoprostanes were readily quantifiable markers of lipid peroxidation that relate to disease-relevant measures (41, 42). Other recent reviews of oxidative stress deemed 8-iso a highly accurate measurement of lipid peroxidation (43, 44).  Covariates  We considered various maternal and adolescent sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics as potential confounders based on a priori knowledge (45–50). Trimester-specific and post-partum body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) were measured, and gestational weight gain was calculated from these measures. At baseline, mothers reported years of education, which served as a proxy for socioeconomic status. We also collected information on maternal age at pregnancy, parity, and delivery type.",b0a4e318-02a7-452c-9d6d-3b7eda58db88
12,methods11,"  Based on a priori knowledge demonstrating links between pubertal development with insulin sensitivity (51), leptin (52), and IGF-1 (53), a trained physician measured pubertal status using a composite of physician-assessed Tanner stages recorded for adolescents. Briefly, Tanner staging is a five-point scale of physical pubertal development based on pubic hair (males and females), breast (females), and genital (males) development (54, 55). Puberty was treated as a dichotomous variable, with adolescents classified as peri-pubertal or pubertal (Tanner stage 2 or greater). Because physical activity has also been linked to decreased MetS and insulin resistance risk in adolescents (56), we collected physical activity information from a self-reported questionnaire previously validated in Mexican adolescents (57, 58). The weekly hours spent performing vigorous (e.g., swimming, running, soccer) and non-vigorous (e.g.",5eae30bb-e3d0-43d8-a5fb-e3696590b722
13,methods12,", walking, cleaning) activities were summed, and quartiles were created based on the present sample. Finally, adolescent bisphenol A (BPA) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were added to predictive models to adjust for current exposures.  Statistical analyses  To examine differences in the distribution of adolescent metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) according to maternal and adolescent sociodemographic characteristics, we examined differences in the mean and standard deviation (SD) of metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) in the entire sample and stratified by sex. We used the same methodology to investigate differences in the distribution of 8-iso among the entire sample and stratified by offspring sex. We calculated trimester-specific summary statistics (geometric means, SD, and percentiles) to examine the distribution of SG-adjusted prenatal urinary bisphenol A (BPA).",4d4bcfa8-9b07-41b1-984e-2740a67231b8
14,methods13," We also calculated trimester-specific summary statistics to explore the distribution of maternal Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). Quantile-Quantile plots of residuals were used to assess the normality of all variables and ln-transformed right-skewed variables, including prenatal maternal urinary bisphenol A (BPA) and 8-iso.  The distribution of prenatal maternal urinary bisphenol A (BPA) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was explored, and the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to compare exposure measures across trimesters. Finally, we provide sex-stratified summary statistics (median and interquartile range) for the distribution of prenatal maternal bisphenol A (BPA) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), adolescent metabolic outcomes of interest, and study covariates.  Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between maternal exposures with adolescent offspring metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) and 8-iso.",8f159964-af8d-401a-94b4-2d69e412913b
15,methods14," Trimester-specific models were created to examine whether the prenatal timing of environmental exposures altered the metabolic programming of offspring. Separate models at each trimester examined the association between prenatal maternal urinary bisphenol A (BPA), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), and the interaction between bisphenol A (BPA) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (i.e., bisphenol A (BPA)*Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) on adolescent metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) and were compared to other trimesters. The bisphenol A (BPA)*Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) interaction term was included in all models to determine if maternal Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) modified the effect of prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure on outcomes of interest. We ran unadjusted regression models, only adjusted for specific gravity to explore the relationship between exposure variables and offspring outcomes. Next, we ran linear regression models adjusted for maternal (i.e.",25baa434-efe4-4f12-92b1-3efe0fccfb05
16,methods15,", trimester specific SG urinary bisphenol A (BPA) and maternal education) and adolescent characteristics (i.e., pubertal status, current urinary bisphenol A (BPA), and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)). We stratified by sex based on a priori knowledge demonstrating the sexually dimorphic effects of bisphenol A (BPA).  Statistical significance was determined a priori at P < 0.05. Due to the small sample size and the exploratory nature of the present analysis, marginal significance was also used to assess the significance of associations and set at P < 0.10. All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA). ",508cdc2b-747d-4c30-b97e-2a215c4cbd02
17,results0," The mean (SD) maternal age at pregnancy was 26.8 (5.6) years, and the mean (SD) age for adolescent offspring was 10.3 (1.7) years. Approximately 53% of the adolescent sample was female (Supplementary Table 1).  Differences in the distribution of adolescent metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) according to maternal and adolescent sociodemographic are presented in Table 1. Adolescent metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) differed by maternal weight, with maternal weight gain positively associated with adolescent metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) in females. Adolescent females born to mothers that gained 6.0–8.5 kg had a lower metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) than those born to mothers that gained 8.5–11.0 kg and > 11.0 kg (p = 0.03). However, metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) differed by adolescent age, pubertal status, and leptin levels among the entire adolescent sample.",825314c6-9d7d-4682-8762-0343ebc59b23
18,results1," Adolescents 8–10 years had a lower metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) than adolescents between 13 and 14 years (– 0.50 vs. 0.30; p = 0.03). After sex stratification, the association persisted among male offspring (p = 0.04). Similarly, adolescents who had entered puberty had a significantly greater metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) than peri-pubertal adolescents (– 0.12 vs. 0.16; p = 0.00). Higher leptin levels were associated with a greater metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) among all adolescents. Adolescents with leptin concentrations <5 ng/mL had a lower metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) compared to those with leptin >15 ng/mL (– 0.51 vs. 0.53; p = 0.00). We did not find evidence of differences in adolescent 8-iso levels by maternal or adolescent characteristics (Table 2).

The distribution of maternal and adolescent urinary bisphenol A (BPA) concentration and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) are presented in Table 3. We found that the median (50th percentile) prenatal maternal urinary bisphenol A (BPA) concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 1.5 ng/mL; concentrations did not differ by pregnancy trimester (Table 3). However, the distribution of urinary bisphenol A (BPA) varied across the trimester, as evident by the large ICCs (Supplementary Table 2). Median maternal Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) did not differ across trimesters (Table 3). Although the ICCs comparing Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) during trimester one vs. trimesters two and three were low (– 0.03 and 0.",2f038c5e-d929-42d4-bf6c-1b55a56ef2ea

Results from unadjusted and adjusted linear regression analyses between maternal exposures and adolescent offspring metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) among the entire sample and stratified by offspring sex are presented in Table 4. We did not observe any significant associations in the unadjusted models. However, after adjustment for a priori covariates and sex-stratification, we found an inverse association between trimester two prenatal urinary bisphenol A (BPA) and metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) in male offspring. To illustrate, every 1-unit increase in ln-transformed trimester two maternal urinary bisphenol A (BPA) was marginally associated with a 72.8% (β = – 0.728; p < 0.10) decrease in adolescent male metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS).",c02078d2-bfc6-4227-985c-fec93a0dfa8b

The patterns between trimester two maternal exposures and metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) in the unstratified sample and the sample of female adolescents were consistent with those observed in male adolescents.

24,discussion0," We examined the association between prenatal maternal urinary bisphenol A (BPA) and adherence to a Mediterranean diet on adolescent offspring metabolic syndrome risk and 8-isoprostane levels among a prospective birth cohort of Mexico City mother-adolescent dyads. To our knowledge, this is the first human epidemiologic study to examine the interactive effects of maternal endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC)-diet exposure on multiple markers of metabolic health among adolescent offspring. Sex-specific findings revealed that higher exposure to trimester two bisphenol A (BPA) was marginally associated with an increase in 8-iso in female offspring, while trimester two Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was significantly associated with a decrease in 8-iso in female offspring. However, trimester two Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) modified the association between bisphenol A (BPA) and 8-iso by decreasing levels in females.",6dcbb00b-d886-42ca-9392-cb76c51c2a68
25,discussion1," Contrary to our hypothesis, higher exposure to prenatal urinary bisphenol A (BPA) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) during trimester two was marginally associated with a decrease in male offspring metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS). However, the interactive effect of exposures was marginally associated with increased metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) in males.  The present study adds to the sparse literature on human prenatal programming research by documenting links between prenatal maternal bisphenol A (BPA) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) on subsequent lipid peroxidation in human adolescent offspring. In line with our hypothesis, results from the present study revealed that prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure during trimester two was marginally associated with an increase in female adolescent offspring oxidative stress (i.e., 8-iso).",15443993-3b91-4d57-b83a-16c81050b12c
26,discussion2," Although the mechanism underlying this marginal association remains unclear, the authors posit that the finding may be explained by other factors, including adolescent body weight, which could induce an oxidative stress response. This idea is corroborated by an animal study that found that perinatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure in rats led to body weight and insulin resistance in later life, which resulted in increased oxidative stress (59). Moreover, in line with this study finding, a recent animal study reported that prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure was associated with increased levels of a different marker of oxidative stress (i.e., 3-nitrotyrosine levels) in cord blood samples of human offspring (60). However, the study did not follow offspring after birth to determine if longitudinal associations persisted through adolescence, nor did the researchers report sex-specific findings.",54b92d2b-4edc-4759-813c-fea91d68083f
27,discussion3," Further supporting our sex-stratified finding on the association between bisphenol A (BPA) and oxidate stress, precedence for perinatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure leading to later life oxidative stress has been reported in murine model studies (61). For example, perinatal bisphenol A (BPA) was correlated with higher oxidative stress markers in puberty (61). Notably, the positive association between bisphenol A (BPA) and oxidative stress only persisted in female offspring after stratification by sex. This sex-specific finding is consistent with sexually dimorphic effects observed in an animal study, which found that perinatal bisphenol A (BPA) was linked to oxidative stress in only one sex but not the other (59). The comparison animal study contrarily revealed that exposure was associated with male offspring oxidative stress but not female offspring oxidative stress (59).",1121d403-06e6-4518-84c4-e53999296a93
28,discussion4," We posit that differences in sex-specific results between the present study and comparison study may be related to various factors. First, likely due to differences in study design and population, with the comparison study being conducted with mice exposed to bisphenol A (BPA) in a controlled environment, while the present study was observational and conducted among humans. Another potential reason for sex-specific differences could be when the outcomes were assessed, with the animal study measuring oxidative stress during adulthood. In contrast, the present study examined outcomes when adolescents were in peri-puberty. A study among adolescent girls revealed that aside from external exposures, higher body mass index (BMI) increased oxidative stress biomarkers over the pubertal windows for girls (62).",0466e882-6925-4ce1-8d7c-c2393e5eaac8
29,discussion5," In addition, experimental research suggests that sex-differences exist in oxidative stress (63), with research underlying mechanisms that explain sex-differences noting that sex-differences in oxidative stress depend on females having higher antioxidant defense and males having increased reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) generation (63).  Our study also found that trimester two Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was significantly associated with increased levels of 8-iso in female offspring, contrary to our hypotheses and most existing research. Although it is unclear why a higher Mediterranean Diet Score (i.e., a healthy diet) was significantly associated with increased oxidative stress in female offspring, the authors posit that these findings could be due to unmeasured confounding.",926cba89-dc0a-4f2a-be11-521f8176c957
30,discussion6," For example, one confounder could have been excessive caloric intake during gestation, which has been associated with a substrate-induced increase in citric acid cycle activity, which results in excess of mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (64), resulting in oxidative stress of both the mother and offspring. Contrary to our study finding, a recent systemic review revealed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet consistently protected offspring against cardiometabolic risk, such that improved adherence to the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy showed lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures in offspring (25). In the present study, we also found that exposure to Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) modified the association between bisphenol A (BPA) and oxidative stress in females.",05a0fd9a-d373-4225-88b2-dccce4c3675f
31,discussion7," The interactive effect of bisphenol A (BPA) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) during trimester two was marginally protective against oxidative stress in females. This finding is difficult to compare to other studies, given the lack of existing human studies. However, our recent mouse study demonstrated that maternal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) and the Mediterranean diet was associated with higher levels of female offspring TGGs at postnatal day 10 (30). However, the interaction of these components was associated with a decrease in TGGs, though the results were not statistically significant. Overall, our findings revealed that adherence to a healthy, Mediterranean diet may have resulted in oxidative stress due to unmeasured confounding, including excessive caloric intake during gestation, which can be harmful even if the diet pattern being consumed is considered healthy.",6640fb42-cb47-4071-bdfd-b9445b4b0dcf
32,discussion8," In addition, our marginal findings indicate that exposure to a healthy, Mediterranean diet during gestation may play a role in modifying the harmful effects of bisphenol A (BPA) exposure and subsequent female adolescent oxidative stress.  Contrary to our hypothesis that prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) would be associated with increased adolescent metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS), our study findings revealed that prenatal urinary bisphenol A (BPA) was associated with decreased metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) in males. A substantial body of literature has revealed that higher exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) can negatively affect human health (65, 66). However, other studies have also revealed that the effect of prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure on metabolic outcomes is often monotonic, with different doses of exposure having various influences on metabolic parameters (67).",81622658-9ba6-4fff-9146-dced64f888b3
33,discussion9," Our finding, which did not align with most existing literature, could be partially explained by several factors, including the fact that we estimated metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) using an average of four metabolic parameters: waist circumference, fasting glucose, lipids, and blood pressure measures. This is important to consider, given that studies have found negative associations between maternal exposure to other endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC)s, such as phthalates and child offspring blood pressure (68), as well as in-utero bisphenol A (BPA) exposure and lower offspring weight (69, 70); thus, one or more of the components that were used to estimate metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) could have biased the measurement in one direction. Future studies should consider looking at each metabolic component used to calculate metabolic risk to determine whether association variation exists.",3fe128e7-2428-4b0c-91be-b0010743ab21
34,discussion10," This study was among the first to examine this research question and its observational nature, so specific recommendations for pregnant women are not yet clear. However, an existing body of literature from animal and human studies indicates that maternal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) can have detrimental effects on the mother, fetus, and offspring in later life (71–74). Therefore, our unexpected study finding does not support the idea that gestational exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) is beneficial. The authors would not recommend that pregnant women increase their exposure to bisphenol A (BPA).  In addition, Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was not associated with male offspring metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS).",4f5c6347-a3cf-4317-b9cc-e12f68f16cb0
35,discussion11," However, results revealed that Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) marginally modified the association between bisphenol A (BPA) and metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS), with the interactive effect of bisphenol A (BPA) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) revealing a marginally positive association with male adolescent metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS). Surprisingly, results revealed that a healthier gestational diet was positively associated with offspring metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS), contrary to existing literature consistently showing that a healthier prenatal diet can have protective effects on offspring cardio-metabolic health (25). However, as previously mentioned, the authors posit that excessive caloric intake of the Mediterranean diet could have negatively impacted metabolic development, which followed offspring during later life. Albeit caloric intake was not accounted for in the present study.",aa79bde4-e16e-457a-8d05-605bba85a45d
36,discussion12," In contrast to our current finding, our recently published mouse study (30) found that the in-utero interactive impact of exposure to a Mediterranean diet and bisphenol A (BPA) was not protective against poor metabolic health in 10-month-old male offspring mice (30). Comparing these studies should be done with caution given differences in study design, population and timing of exposures and outcomes.  In terms of comparing our findings to other human studies, one human epidemiologic study among a Turkish cohort found a link between higher bisphenol A (BPA) and metabolic syndrome in pre-pubertal obese children (75). However, in the study, researchers did not conduct sex-stratified analyses to determine if there were differences between male and female children. Conflicting findings between animal and human studies suggest that the timing and life stage of exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) may be critical for determining health impact (76, 77).",f3ed7931-3535-401f-8afc-5d246938f93f
37,discussion13," Despite our original hypothesis that prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) would be associated with increased adolescent metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS), a recent study investigating the impact of prenatal and concurrent bisphenol A (BPA) exposure on adolescent lipid profile (total cholesterol, TGGs, HDL-C) among the present cohort reported that bisphenol A (BPA) did not affect lipid profiles (55). Additionally, another study among the present cohort reported that trimester three bisphenol A (BPA) exposure was not correlated to body mass index (BMI) z-score and skinfold thickness measures (78). These variable findings among multiple birth cohorts warrant additional investigation into the potential effects of prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure on offspring metabolic risk in late adolescence.  The present study had many strengths. First, the longitudinal, observational nature allowed for repeated maternal urinary bisphenol A (BPA) exposure and dietary measures.",79960b7d-c280-4b58-8540-c4d51bbbb4f2
38,discussion14," We compared exposure and outcome associations across all three trimesters of pregnancy by obtaining repeated exposures. The trimester-specific measures evaluated critical windows of susceptibility to each exposure; this proved insightful since trimester two maternal bisphenol A (BPA) exerted a more significant effect, while trimesters one and three were not predictive of adolescent health outcomes. Another strength included using urinary bisphenol A (BPA) as a biomarker of exposure rather than relying on self-reported bisphenol A (BPA) exposure. This study also used multiple objective metabolic markers to assess adolescent offspring metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) and oxidative stress.  Limitations of this study included the observational nature; thus, causality could not be assumed. Another limitation was that we collected one spot urine sample during each trimester to estimate maternal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA).",e0724230-4c26-4b03-96e8-fe8ac47cee9b
39,discussion15," Urinary bisphenol A (BPA) concentrations vary by recent exposure; thus, a single urine sample may not represent actual bisphenol A (BPA) concentrations. However, averaging bisphenol A (BPA) measures across the three trimesters of pregnancy may have reduced this potential inaccuracy. Similarly, we controlled for prenatal specific gravity (SG) to adjust for urinary dilution. However, studies have shed light on the limitations of adjusting for specific gravity, such as specific gravity varying by body mass index (BMI). However, there are many strengths to adjusting for specific gravity among pregnant women (79). To illustrate these strengths, in comparison to creatinine, specific gravity is a more appropriate correction approach for studies of pregnant women because of better within-person reproducibility and less affected by participant demographics (79).",c1735beb-0ceb-4b00-9c4b-773641e26897
40,discussion16," Another limitation was that health outcomes measured at a single time point during adolescence could not provide insight into possible alterations in metabolic health over time. In particular, puberty and transition to young adulthood is an extended developmental period over which several different metabolic risk factors may emerge (80). Thus, comparing offspring metabolic health measures across the pubertal transition would be more instructive for determining if prenatal exposures impact offspring health at specific times or if the trajectory of metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) and 8-isoprostane changes over time based on prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure. Another potential limitation of our study was the use of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), which was not developed to accommodate the eating habits of the Mexican population.",b5ab5fed-81f7-4c3d-9014-5c29adc0d5f5
41,discussion17," Given that eating habits are strongly influenced by culture (81), such as food consumption norms, modes of food preparation that are specific to a culture, and other culturally driven factors that influence how a population eats, it is possible that using Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) did not capture the gestational dietary patterns of mothers enrolled in the present study. Moreover, phenols, including bisphenol A (BPA) and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals (endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC)s), such as phthalates, are widespread in the environment (82). The exposure route to these chemicals is likely to occur via dietary intake, with phenol residuals found in fruit and meat products (83). Whether the diet is the primary source of exposure to these chemicals remains unclear (84). Nonetheless, sufficient evidence indicates that chemical mixture exposure is more likely to occur than exposure to single chemicals in isolation (85).",c1892a23-c717-4f76-ac17-4ad65d9f042f
42,discussion18," Thus, one potential limitation of this study was that we solely examined exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) and its interaction with Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). However, participating mothers were likely exposed to mixtures of endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC)s, which may have masked the actual effect of bisphenol A (BPA) alone. Future studies among the present cohort will consider mixtures of endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC)s in relation to metabolic health of mother-adolescent dyads from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) cohort, including the potential for diet to modify these associations. Finally, given strong evidence that the prenatal maternal environmental is associated with increased risk of offspring MetS in later life (5, 6), including adolescence, future studies should examine how adolescent metabolic syndrome risk score (MRS) correlates with adult risk for metabolic syndrome.",4697f7db-435a-4bd8-8295-c3dd91f697b3
43,discussion19,"  In conclusion, our study findings suggest that trimester two exposure to prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) and a healthy diet have a sexually dimorphic impact on adolescent offspring oxidative stress (females) and MetS risk (males). Understanding the impact of the in-utero environment on adolescent offspring metabolic health is critical to informing future interventions that aim to prevent MetS risk and oxidative stress in offspring. Future studies among diverse cohorts of mother-adolescent dyads should utilize a longitudinal framework with multiple oxidative and metabolic health biomarkers to determine if associations persist.
