0,methods0,"The database used is the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS)’s Poll 3170 from March 2017 [33]. The Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS) (Sociological Research Center) is a technical service of the general state administration in Spain, in charge of the scientific study of the Spanish society. The Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS) applies scientific methods in order to obtain representative samples of the Spanish population. The participation in the poll is voluntary. Once the volunteers have accepted to participate, they can decide not to answer some questions. However, all the answers included in the poll are anonymous and protected by the laws of statistical secrecy and data protection. Besides, no personal data or identifiers of the person who has responded are kept (these characteristics of the poll and the correspondent questionnaire can be seen with more detail at http://www.cis.es/cis/opencms/ES/1_encuestas/ComoSeHacen/pasosencuesta.",980c66fe-490f-48c5-8da5-c09d95c5f08f

The total sample interviewed was 2487 people of Spanish nationality, aged 18 or over. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 24 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).  Dependent variables included self-rated assessment of the state of health (question 22), the degree of satisfaction with life in general (question 9), and the assessment of perceived happiness or unhappiness (question 25). The state of health is rated on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being “very good”, 2 “good”, 3 “fair”, 4 “bad”, and 5 “very bad”. The degree of satisfaction with life in general is on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is “completely unsatisfied” and 10 is “completely satisfied”. The degree of perceived happiness is also on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 “completely unhappy” and 10 “completely happy”.",adaffa9e-d161-4d07-89c3-cdc1ed59438d
2,methods2,"  With the self-assessed state of health, we carried out an ordinal logistic regression in which the values of the dependent variable were grouped into three values, given that the percentage of people who rated their health as “bad” or “very bad” is negligible. Thus, the value 1 refers to “bad or very bad rating”, the value 2 to “fair”, and the value 3 to “good or very good”. With the dependent variables for life-satisfaction and happiness rating, we modelled multiple linear regressions. Since we considered that the relation between these three variables might be bidirectional, the assessment of state of health was included as an independent variable within the other two models.  Independent variables included basically sociodemographic variables and variables relating to lifestyle habits, mostly eating habits. The sociodemographic variables included were the following: sex, age, size of community, marital status, type of household, education, working situation, and household income.",3df1abe7-a583-4a46-8414-030a47ee450c
3,methods3," As variables relating to eating habits, we considered how often meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, and sweets were consumed; how the food was prepared (personally cooked or ready-made meals); how often meals were eaten out at restaurants or cafés; how often with family or friends; how often food was taken from home or bought to be eaten outside the home. Last, we also included body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), how often exercise was taken, and the nature of the personal economic situation as independent variables. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated, following the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, as a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. For most adults, 18·5–24·9 kg/m2 is considered a normal body mass index (BMI) range: within the healthy weight range.",40cee656-3dd4-4caf-9d5e-0518dbdc5d20
4,methods4,"  Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the population studied, according to sex (to access the cross-over of other variables, please see the link available at [33]). Out of the 2487 participants in the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS)’s Poll 3170, 1271 were women (51.1%) and 1216 (48.9%) were men. The mean age was 50 years (51 the women and 49 the men). More than a half of the participants were married (50.7% of the women and 53.3% of the men). Almost two thirds of the households consisted of couples with or without children, (to a greater extent with children). With respect to the educational level, the weight represented by women in both extremes is higher than the represented by men. This pattern is repeated in relation to the self-assessed personal economic situation, though less markedly. The opposite pattern applies to household income, with a higher proportion of men reporting values of household income in the extremes.",ae93b9f5-8b0d-4b4a-9f54-729bcf32e497
5,methods5,"  Among the results of the analysis presented below, we only present the variables that showed some statistical significance in the regressions carried out. At the same time, in this study we did not aim to quantify probabilities but to analyze “correlation” or “association” of the variables that appeared significant, analyzing their effect with all other factors being equal.   The main hypothesis of this study is to confirm the association between eating habits and subjective well-being. An additional hypothesis was considered that referred to the association between other lifestyle habits also related, though not so directly, with eating habits, and subjective well-being.",5e91c14b-1030-4947-a6c2-e421ad675d8a
6,methods6," These hypotheses are expressed through six questions: the main hypothesis is expressed in the first three questions and the additional hypothesis in the last three—Is the frequency of consumption of healthy produce (fruit/vegetables and fish) associated with greater subjective well-being? Does eating in company make us feel happier? Is eating ready-made food associated with a more negative assessment of health? Does feeling healthy contribute to greater degrees of subjective well-being? Are people who have obesity happier? Does exercise improve well-being?   3. Results  Before presenting the results obtained in the regressions carried out, let us show the aggregated values of the dependent variables considered in the research (Table 2). Men reported good or very good perceived health in greater proportion than women (75.1% vs. 67.7%, respectively). The mean rating of the satisfaction with life reported was 7.30 (range 0–10) in both cases.",0b160cf0-5d28-4249-b75e-f80a5e38932d
7,methods7," However, the mean happiness rating reported by the men was slightly higher than the reported by women (7.74 vs. 7.67, range 0–10, respectively).  3.1. Assessment of State of Health  Spanish people as a whole have a mainly positive assessment of their general state of health. Only 5.0% of Spaniards consider their health bad or very bad, 58.3% consider their health good, and 13.0% perceive their health as very good. As can be seen in Table 3, the sociodemographic variables most commonly associated with a good state of health are a person’s sex and either living as a couple with children or living with mother and/or father (with or without siblings). Men generally give a more positive assessment than women, particularly before the age of 30. Some variables related with eating habits also produce significant results, in particular the social relations surrounding meals.",de93b8fe-465b-41c1-a6bf-b8ea1fd99672
8,methods8," Thus, having lunch or dinner with family or friends several times a month appears to be a factor that affects how the state of health is rated. Interestingly, eating sweets several times a week also produces positive results.   Rating one’s personal economic situation as good has a great influence on self-assessed health (curiously, to a greater extent than rating it as very good), as is engaging in physical exercise and having a normal body mass index. A high level of happiness is also associated positively with a high level of perceived health (Table 3).  3.2. Satisfaction with Life In general, Spanish people feel fairly satisfied with their life, with a score of 7.3 out of 10. As shown in Table 4, age and household income are the only two sociodemographic variables that emerge as being associated positively with a high level of life-satisfaction.",22d8baa6-bb5f-4eb9-bb69-03aebd83cebf
9,methods9," With respect to household income, the people who are least satisfied with their life are those whose income falls below €1801, and very markedly when it is under €600 a month. People under 40 are most satisfied with their life, while, in relation to income, people who rate their personal economic situation as good or very good are most satisfied. Rating perceived health as good or very good is associated positively with a high level of satisfaction with life.   Variables related to eating habits do not greatly affect general life-satisfaction, but it could be said that eating meat frequently is associated negatively with life-satisfaction, while frequent consumption of fruit is more favorable, pointing out a possible positive association of the Mediterranean diet with life-satisfaction (Table 4).  3.3. Personal Happiness People in Spain rate their state of happiness positively, as the average score for the population is 7.7 out of 10.",524d9fd8-b3a1-4390-925e-b325a39c712a
10,methods10," What factors affect happiness most significantly? It emerges that the most important variables are having a personal economic situation rated good or very good and having a state of health perceived as good or very good. Age is also a significant element: the younger a person is, the happier, especially between the ages 18 and 30. In contrast, the smaller the community in which a person lives, the lower their state of happiness will be, and having a university-level education or a low household income were found to have similar negative associations (Table 5).  The variables related to eating habits are unimportant in connection with feeling happy or unhappy. There is only a small positive association with happiness and the consumption of fish and a negative one with the consumption of meat. Engaging in physical exercise is even less important (Table 5).  4. Discussion As the results presented above show, income matters and matters significantly.",778acb73-03e9-4cc4-a0fc-1eb526b792e4
11,methods11," There is a vast array of literature on the relationship between money and happiness. These studies generally point to the existence of a positive effect from higher income but with diminishing returns and even, marginally, the possibility of an inverse causality [13,15,24,34]. The results obtained in our study are in line with previous research, and specifically in the context of Spain [35,36,37]. In turn, several variables related to eating habits, were also associated with subjective well-being. To place these findings in context, we compare the results presented above with the available literature. The objective is to confirm, in a practical and accurate manner, the relation between food and subjective well-being and to account for how this relation manifests specifically in the case of Spain.  4.1.",26b040a3-2efc-4d7c-bf05-bd91bc7421e2
12,methods12," Is the Frequency of Consumption of Healthy Produce Associated with Greater Subjective Well-Being?  In practically all research reviewed, it can be said that, out of all the food groups, consumption of fruit and vegetables shows a strong and significant positive effect with respect to subjective well-being [26]. The literature examining the Spanish case in this area is sparse and found in publications on health matters, in cross-sectional studies focusing on the relation between general patterns of adherence to the Mediterranean diet and well-being. For example, Grao-Cruces et al. [28], using a sample of 1973 Andalusian teenagers (ages 11–18), conclude that the individuals who keep more closely to the Mediterranean diet are physically more active and show a higher level of satisfaction with life than those with a low-quality diet. However, as Blázquez et al. [29] demonstrate, the relationship between eating habits and self-assessed health is disputed.",7a58ac39-fa1f-4765-b478-074176e8a154
13,methods13," Specifically, in their study of people over 50, there was a very weak correlation (though statistically significant), between the number of aspects of healthy eating that individuals met and their self-assessed score on health. At the same time, by means of adjusted multiple linear regression models, Zaragoza et al. [30], basing their work on a sample of 351 people over 60, found a direct relationship between following a Mediterranean diet and life-satisfaction for women, though the association was not significant in the case of men. Lastly, Ferrer-Cascales et al. [31], using a sample of 527 teenagers, found a positive association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and happiness.  In our study, life-satisfaction was only associated positively with consumption of fresh fruit. The association of other food groups with happiness is not significant.",f4968f95-2f8a-4557-bc1e-e56e3ff4207a
14,methods14," Curiously, those who ate sweets several times a week had a higher self-assessment for health than those who stated that they seldom or never ate them. The association found here could be related to the fact that those who enjoy a good basic state of health allow themselves this habit.   4.2. Does Eating in Company Make Us Feel Happier?  There are some previous studies in the academic literature that positively relate sharing meals with others and well-being. For example, in a non-Western setting, Yiengprugsawan et al. [38], using data from a cohort of 39,820 people in Thailand, found a correlation between frequently eating alone and both poor perceived health and unhappiness, concluding that sharing meals could contribute to improving people’s happiness. A positive relationship between the frequency of having dinner in company and happiness is shown by a sample of 400 elderly individuals (aged from 60 to 90) living in Central Chile, by means of ordered logit models [39].",31a2ca13-d93c-43fb-b304-e383c9def231
15,methods15,"   In his survey of the literature on how much hedonism affects happiness, Veenhoven [2] underlines the positive relationship between leisure activities—especially outdoors, such as eating out and sport—and happiness. Even in a highly self-sufficient society in the Bolivian Amazon, social leisure activities show a positive association with happiness [40].   In our study, we cannot confirm that the fact of sharing meals is associated with greater happiness. There is, however, a very significant relationship between eating at the home of family and/or friends (especially if several times a month) and a higher level of self-rated health. Moreover, eating at a restaurant or similar establishment shows no significant relationship with any indicator of subjective well-being, though it must be borne in mind that the question in the survey we used mentions the location and does not ask if restaurants were visited alone or in company, nor whether visits were for work or for leisure reasons.",faaa6956-ce10-4180-b647-829b0b2542f2
16,methods16," These are important nuances that affect how far we can analyze the possibility of a positive interaction between company and eating.  4.3. Is Eating Ready-Made Food Associated with a More Negative Assessment of Health?  We have found no previous studies on this area in the literature. In our case, we did not detect any significant association with any of the indicators of subjective well-being under consideration. It is true, however, that the category does not include any specific products and only divides meals into those prepared by oneself and those bought ready-made.   4.4. Does Feeling Healthy Contribute to Greater Degrees of Subjective Well-Being?  The positive association between subjective health and both life satisfaction and happiness, as shown in the empirical evidence available, is practically universal [36,41].",b269bf41-648e-4b0a-93a7-bb8e244ad5c0
17,methods17," Our findings provide support for this assertion: those who rate their health as good or very good claim to be happier and show a higher level of satisfaction with life to a very significant degree. Our findings are in line with other studies carried out in Spain, including Videra-García and Reigal-Garrido [16] and Lera-López et al. [22,37].   4.5. Are People Who Have Obesity Happier?  Despite the popular Spanish belief in the “happy fat person”, the academic literature on the subject suggests that obesity is rather associated with lower subjective well-being, which can be attributed to both its negative impact on health and also the social stigma associated with it [42]. While the results obtained in our study do not enable us to state that people with overweight feel happier, they do show an association between having a normal body mass index (BMI) and less life-satisfaction.",b0e23464-2fff-4813-a82b-c1b7679413ec
18,methods18," This is an unexpected result, given that a body mass index (BMI) above the healthy range is associated in the literature with lower levels of subjective well-being, showing, for instance, the existence of a bi-directional linkage between obesity and depression [42].  4.6. Does Exercise Improve Well-Being? The academic literature provides support for a positive relation between physical exercise and happiness (for example, in the systematic review carried out by Zhang and Chen [43]). This association is also found between exercising and life satisfaction (see for example Pettay [44], with almost 800 college students in the United States of America, and Lera-López et al. [22], with a sample of 816 individuals aged from 50 to 70 in Spain). Contrary to expectations, our analysis only found a positive relation between physical exercise and better self-rated health. This result agrees with that obtained by Blázquez et al. [29], with a sample of 781 people over 50 years old.  Baruth et al.",5e9bf0d6-3bbf-4361-9c74-f2e2fe6034d2
19,methods19," [45], in a longitudinal study of 2132 initially sedentary men, concluded that men who were usually very happy and optimistic increased their physical activity significantly more than men who were not happy. In our case, we cannot tell if physical exercise has a positive influence on perceived health or whether those who perceived a good level of health tend to take exercise more often. However, those who exercise have a more positive assessment of their own health, especially those who do so once a week.   5. Conclusions The data that we present here enable us to explore the relation between subjective well-being and eating. Individuals’ assessments of their own state of health, their satisfaction with life, and their level of happiness allow us to understand how far food contributes to well-being. Corroborating this relation with statistically representative data about the Spanish population is something that is new in an area that is usually approached through ad hoc studies.",ebcd4f7f-e515-4b26-b066-daf01d61d178
20,methods20," Moreover, it is particularly important to confirm (or not) the relationship in a society such as Spain’s, where the Mediterranean diet forms part of the cultural identity and supports good eating habits.   We have been able to confirm that being able to rate one’s personal economic situation favorably is particularly important and influences positively and significantly the self-assessed state of health, satisfaction with life, and level of happiness. At the same time, those who rate their state of health positively are the happiest and most satisfied with their lives, so that money and health are shown to be the keys to well-being.   With regard to Spanish people’s well-being in relation to their eating habits, it seems that not only is the food they eat of particular importance, but also the people they eat with.",1e837600-4363-4689-8930-4ea0f8d9386c
21,methods21," As far as what is eaten is concerned, it is not possible to say that those who eat healthily show a higher level of subjective well-being, beyond suggesting a potential positive association between the Mediterranean diet and overall life satisfaction. All in all, it can be stated that the selection of foods per se is associated with well-being. This issue is especially relevant in the Spanish case, where a solid food culture shared by the population guides the choice of products that make up the Mediterranean diet. The data show greater degrees of well-being among those who eat more fresh fruit, as well as those who eat more sweets. These data could indicate that what really produces well-being is being able to choose.   The data analyzed appear to indicate that subjective well-being is related to company (who one eats with), as, although the data show us “where one eats”, those who eat with family and friends have a better assessment of their health.",cc36d98d-72c7-431f-9531-e0f6e1fd1970
22,methods22," Therefore, these surroundings make sociability the best context for a satisfying meal. The Spanish case is particularly paradigmatic with respect to food, since the family-centered environments, typical of Spanish culture, favor social relationships being played out around eating and therefore may enable a feeling of subjective well-being.   We have further noted that there is a direct relation between engaging in more exercise and assessing one’s health positively, especially among those who take moderate exercise on a regular basis. We can assume that self-perceived health acts as a middle term between physical exercise and happiness; we cannot therefore say that someone who takes exercise is happier, but we can affirm that those who take exercise feel healthier. Thus, physical exercise results in a positive perception of the state of health that leads to subjective well-being.",34050e9f-890d-411c-b2e6-981f5a77bfea
23,methods23," Essentially, the results show that we are not dealing with a direct relationship between food and well-being or exercise and well-being.   However, we consider that there are at least two factors that are key to interpreting the subtleties of this relationship: on the one hand, sociability acts as a middle term between food and well-being; on the other hand, health is a middle term between physical exercise and well-being. The keys to this relationship lie in the way that individuals act to seek a source of satisfaction and well-being in food and in physical exercise.  The limitations of the present work include the fact that, as it deals with a cross-sectional study, apart from conjecturing some plausible interpretations, it does not permit us to draw conclusions about causality.   The strong points that stand out from the research are its basis on a representative national sample from the population of Spain and with more variables than other Spanish works.",5009e368-e72b-4021-8e21-d3a5c96d46a8
24,methods24," This is something that is particularly important when we bear in mind that comparative studies on subjective well-being carried out at an international level have not included the Spanish case [26]. The fact that our study has considered variables that have seldom been examined in the academic literature on subjective well-being, including the situation of eating out or concern about the consumption of ready-made meals at home, is also important. In summary, this is the only study conducted in Spain with these points of focus, and we consider it a useful, though modest, contribution to the literature on eating and well-being.  We should not conclude this analysis without drawing attention to an element that underlies this research: the relevance and the limitations of Spanish surveys to capture the food cultural aspects.",9d980933-1450-4b75-899d-9e52c0f3fe98
25,methods25," It is clear that we need to have reliable data to corroborate our hypotheses, however, some surveys, such as the one used here, are not fully capable to capture the sociability or the food meanings that explain the decisions about what and how to eat. This deficiency constitutes a problem for advancing the knowledge of the feeding habits in societies like Spain, in which a solid alimentary culture is central. With quantitative methodologies or qualitative approaches, we consider it convenient to continue researching about the positive social interaction around meals, in order to gain a deeper understanding about our Mediterranean diet.
