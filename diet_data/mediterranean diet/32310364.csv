0,methods0," 2.1. Design and Participants  This cross-sectional study was carried out in the Valle de Ricote, which is composed of five different municipalities and is located in the Region of Murcia (Spain). All schools in these municipalities were asked to participate in this research. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling from six schools (public and private). Despite using this sampling method, all children from the eligible schools were requested to participate. The final sample included 370 Spanish schoolchildren aged 6–13 years. In order to participate in the study, participants were given a written informed consent that had to be signed by their parents or legal guardian. Additionally, these children and their parents or legal guardians received a short explanation about the study’s aims, and the tests and questionnaires that would be administered.",eebdf1f8-a8f0-427e-87f3-1f542a6b5e46
1,methods1," In terms of inclusion criteria, only schoolchildren aged 6–13 years with parents or legal guardians who signed the informed consent were enrolled. Conversely, regarding the exclusion criteria, schoolchildren were not enrolled when they: (a) were exempt from the subject of physical education at school, since both the tests and the fulfilment of the questionnaires were carried out in the physical education lessons; (b) suffered from some kind of dysfunction that limited the practice of physical activity (i.e., any disease or motor problem); and (c) were taking some kind of pharmacological treatment. This study obtained ethics approval from the Bioethics Committee of the University of Murcia (ID 2218/2018). It was conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration and respected the human rights of the participants involved.  2.2. Procedures  Age and sex were self-reported. Area of residence was categorized into (1) rural (≤5000 inhabitants) and (2) urban (>5000 inhabitants) [24].",592a0a8c-21ce-4b35-a615-3c64a9b009f2
2,methods2," The type of schooling was dichotomized into two categories: (1) public and (2) private with public funds.  cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) was evaluated with the 20 m Shuttle Run Test, which has shown moderate-to-high validity for predicting maximum oxygen uptake and appears to be a helpful alternative for assessing this physical fitness component when it is not feasible to measure or determine the maximum oxygen uptake directly in a laboratory test [25]. In this test, children have to run between two lines 20 m apart while maintaining the rhythm with audio prompts from a Bluetooth-enabled speaker. The speed started at 8.5 km/h and this was augmented by 0.5 km/h per stage (with a stage duration of 1 min). The test ended when the schoolchildren did not reach the ending line at a time when the audio signals were received. cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), in terms of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) (mL/kg/min), was predicted using a well-recognized protocol [26].",f5595b83-5678-4845-a580-380c7574143a
3,methods3," Additionally, we decided to perform the analyses by establishing two categories for cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) = first and second tertile; high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) = third tertile).  Recreational ST was measured based on the average daily hours that the children usually played videogames or watched TV. The children were asked for the number of hours that they usually engaged in recreational ST through the Krece Plus Short Test, which was previously validated by the enKid Study for participants aged 4–14 years [27]. The question used was: “On average, how many hours do you play video games or watch TV daily?”. As it is stated in this test, children from 6 to 12 years old answered by themselves with the help of the research assistant, while 13-year old participants answered alone. Likewise, two groups for recreational ST were created (≥2 h = high ST; <2 h = low ST) following the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for ST [28].",7df1cd51-6cea-4ebc-8e99-9b279f21f675
4,methods4,"  The KIDMED index was applied to test the adherence to the MD [8]. This questionnaire contains 16 questions associated with the attitudes of Mediterranean dietary patterns. The final score varies from −4 to 12 points, and it contains items with negative implications, which are scored with −1 point (e.g., skipping breakfast and consuming sweets or fast food). Items with positive implications are scored with +1 point (e.g., consumes fish regularly or has breakfast), as indicated previously.  Children were weighed twice, while wearing light clothing, using a digital scale (Tanita BC-545, Tokyo, Japan) and a stadiometer (Leicester Tanita HR 001, Tokyo, Japan). The z-scores for body mass index were calculated by the LMS method, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria [29]. Waist circumference was measured with flexible metric tape at the intersection between iliac crest and the last rib.",1d0b1783-b726-45a5-b966-32cf4fe9fa24
5,methods5," Skinfold measurements were taken at the triceps, biceps, iliac crest, and subscapular on the basis of the suggestions of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK)). All measurements were performed by staff certified by the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) (level II). The full skinfold measurement computation was used to determine body density [30] and the Siri formula was considered to estimate body fat through body density [31].  2.3. Statistical Analysis  Continuous information is specified as the mean (standard deviation), while categorical information is indicated as numbers (percentages). The assumption of normality of the variables was verified by statistical procedures (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test), as well as graphical procedures (normal probability plot). We applied Student’s t-test to verify the differences in continuous information between sexes.",2e4caa33-9c0f-404e-aaee-50102913f065
6,methods6," cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), recreational ST, and KIDMED score did not meet the assumption of normality and were converted before the analyses. To help with understanding, we used the two-step technique to transform non-normally distributed continuous data into normally distributed data [32]. Additionally, we created four different categories related to recreational ST and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) to display the differences across them: (1) Low ST/High cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), (2) High ST/High cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), (3) Low ST/Low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and (4) High ST/Low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Bivariate and partial correlation coefficients (r), adjusted by potential covariates (age, sex, and body fat percentage), were calculated as a preliminary analysis to assess the relationships between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), recreational ST, and adherence to the MD.",30cc6b84-7eb5-42b7-a403-15b9f1cf455c
7,methods7," To assess the differences between the mean values of KIDMED score across categories of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (high and low) and recreational ST (high and low), analyses of covariance (and low) analyses of covariance (ANCOVA)) were applied. Pairwise post hoc comparisons were tested by the Bonferroni test. With a total sample of 370 schoolchildren, the posteriori sample calculation for and low) analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) showed a power of analysis of 98% probability of refusing the null hypothesis. Initial analyses revealed no significant interactions between sex and mean differences in recreational ST and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (ST p = 0.142; and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) p = 0.994), as well as for age (ST p = 0.220; and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) p = 0.466); hence, all analyses were carried out with both girls and boys together to increase statistical power.",256cfd6a-2258-43c0-8157-6df778b42424
8,methods8,"  Linear regression models were fitted using bootstrapped (10,000 samples) mediation techniques contained in the PROCESS SPSS macro (version 3.5), to inspect whether the association between recreational ST and adherence to the MD was mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) [33]. In this sense: (a) the regression of the mediator (cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)) on the independent variable (recreational ST) was applied in the first equation; (b) the regression of the independent variable (recreational ST) on the dependent variable (adherence to the MD) was performed in the second equation; (c) the regression of the adherence to the MD dependent variable on both the independent (recreational ST) and the mediator variable (cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)) was carried out in the third equation.",74ac898d-aabb-48e2-aeec-9c4212f58f97
9,methods9," The next criteria were considered to determine mediation: (i) the independent variable is linked to the mediator; (ii) the independent variable is linked to the dependent variable; (iii) the mediator is linked to the dependent variable; (iv) the association between the independent and dependent variable is diminished when the mediator is integrated in the regression model. Age, sex, area of residence, type of schooling, and body fat percentage were included as potential covariates. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 24.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York, NY, USA), and statistical significance was considered at p < 0.050.  3. Results  Table 1 shows the descriptive data of the study participants. Girls reported both lower height and waist circumference than boys (p < 0.050). No statistically significant differences were found between boys and girls for KIDMED score, recreational ST, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF).",609f716d-65f9-4670-af8f-6226a649e243
10,methods10,"  Table 2 reports the bivariate and partial correlations among recreational ST, adherence to the MD (KIDMED score), and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) was positively linked to KIDMED score (r = 0.126) and inversely related to recreational ST (r = −0.088) (only when adjusted by potential confounders). Likewise, a negative relationship was found between recreational ST and KIDMED score (r = −0.171). Notwithstanding, all of these correlations were low.  and low) analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) showed the greatest adherence to the MD in a high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)/low ST group (M = 7.2; SE = 0.1), whereas the lowest adherence to the MD was found in the low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)/high ST group (M = 5.6; SE = 0.1).",cc42d46f-f9c1-4eed-8f09-aea1208b1d0a
11,methods11," Likewise, we found a significant difference between high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)/low ST and the other three groups: high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)/high ST, low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)/low ST, and low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)/high ST (p < 0.050 for all) for KIDMED score after adjusting for age, sex, area of residence, type of schooling, and body fat percentage (Figure 1).  In general, when we verified the mediator role of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in the association between recreational ST and adherence to the MD, recreational ST was inversely related to cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (p = 0.037) (first equation). Recreational ST was inversely related to adherence to the MD (p = 0.003) (second equation). Lastly, when recreational ST and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) were integrated together in the regression model (third equation), cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) was positively related to adherence to the MD (p = 0.",3078fa5b-6f94-4992-8082-9adec77d61df
12,methods12,"020) and although recreational ST continued to be inversely related to adherence to the MD, this relationship was slightly attenuated (indirect effect = −0.027; CI 95% = (−0.080, −0.002)). These results suggest that the association between recreational ST and adherence to the MD is mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (Figure 2).  4. Discussion  Our study aimed to examine the combined relationship between recreational ST and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with adherence to the MD among Spanish schoolchildren as well as elucidate whether the relationship between recreational ST and adherence to the MD is mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). The current results showed that children with higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and lower recreational ST had the highest levels of adherence to the MD (KIDMED score).",8f57cf8a-ba0e-42ea-ab7d-36f732970409
13,methods13," Likewise, the mediation analyses disclosed that the association between recreational ST and adherence to the MD was slightly attenuated by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Therefore, a reduction in recreational ST should be accompanied by physical activity that generates improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) because children with a higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (and less recreational ST) are more likely to adhere to the MD.  A negative association between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and recreational ST was found. This is consistent with the scientific literature, which indicated that increased engagement in recreational ST could reduce cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) levels, even when adjusting for physical activity [2,34]. Moreover, another systematic review showed that greater ST was significantly related to lower cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) across study designs, as well as some longitudinal studies [2].",c2469971-dc2d-4bd2-ae46-6d9d44f1f481
14,methods14," Likewise, one systematic review with a metanalysis [35] found convincing evidence of the inverse association between recreational ST and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in children. One explanation for this finding could be related to displacement theory, which indicates that ST displaces the time spent in physical activities. This hypothesis has been proved in a longitudinal study, where it was found that children who exceed the amount of ST (greater than 2 h daily) at the age of six had higher body mass values and were less active at the age of eight and ten than their counterparts who at the age of six spent less ST [36].  In this study, a positive link between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and adherence to the MD was identified. These results agree with the results obtained by García-Hermoso et al. [37] in a recent systematic review and metanalysis with 565,421 youths, which indicated a positive relationship between MD and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF).",2e4e5c5e-fd7d-49cc-98da-3fbf1b3dc5d1
15,methods15," One reason that could justify this finding to certain extent is the above-mentioned association between MD and active lifestyle, because greater engagement in physical activity (as a consequence of active lifestyle) may increase the cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) [38]. It is well-known that part of the health benefits associated with the MD may be due to other properties of the Mediterranean lifestyle including physical activity. However, recently, it was indicated that children with higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) described a greater consumption of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates [22]. Likewise, earlier research showed higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in children who presented moderate or great adherence to the MD [17] and in children with a greater frequency of vegetable and fruit consumption [39].",47bfa6ed-1b85-4170-bce9-ebcb62d13c14
16,methods16,"  In the scientific literature, it is suggested that food consumption (especially if it takes the form of energy-dense snacks and beverages) could increase during TV viewing, which could increase total energy intake and, consequently, turn into body weight gains. This hypothesis is known as a mindless eating [40]. Likewise, recreational ST was related to a lower adherence to the MD in children [37]. Among the causes of the negative trend in adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern in Spanish youths, spending more than 4 h daily ST seemed to be the most relevant [41]. Similarly, our study also indicated an inverse relationship between recreational ST and adherence to the MD, concurring with the recent systematic review and metanalysis mentioned above [37]. Shi et al. [42] suggested that children who consume healthy foods are more likely to engage in physical activities and less likely to engage in sedentary behaviors in comparison with children who consume less healthy foods.",7439fefe-87ec-458f-a3ee-f37a8db01da9
17,methods17," Nonetheless, it is uncertain if children with more hours of ST have an overall unhealthy diet [43] or if they consume foods during ST that affect their general diet [44].  Finally, our findings suggest that the negative association of ST with the adherence to the MD was attenuated by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). This finding could be explained by two essential aspects. Firstly, though a large part of the variability in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is determined by genetics, certain lifestyle factors (especially physical activity) are also fundamental factors of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) [45]. Along this line, higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) levels could diminish the negative trend of the above-mentioned displacement theory as far as recreational ST is concerned.",f1c9739c-c25d-4ab1-8153-828f58115840
18,methods18," Secondly, as a consequence of having an active lifestyle, and subsequently less time to spend in front of screens, children could have greater levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) [46], which could mitigate the deleterious effects of the above-mentioned mindless eating hypothesis. Thirdly, another possible explanation could be some personality attributes, such as self-regulation. In this sense, children considered active (and a priori with higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)) and those who with low recreational ST were separately and jointly linked to higher self-regulation [47], which could be related to better eating habits. These results may provide essential information for healthcare professionals to promote effective interventions aimed at improving the healthy eating habits in children, contributing to the urgent need to improve healthy eating habits worldwide [48]. Furthermore, a healthy lifestyle during childhood should be promoted in a holistic manner (i.e.",ce631386-180f-447f-bc5a-81fbfa0d47ef
19,methods19,", lower recreational ST and higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) through physical activity), rather than treated in isolation [49]. However, future experimental studies with randomization to manipulations in recreational ST exposure and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) improvements are needed to prove cause–effect associations, test interventions, and establish mediators (mechanisms) of these associations.  In this study, some limitations should be reported. Firstly, because of the cross-sectional design of the current study, it was not possible to determine if the perceived associations indicate cause and effect relations. Secondly, we did not use a gas-analyzed peak oxygen uptake to assess cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), though it is considered the physiological criterion for measuring children’s cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF).",cdc90a09-f99b-4a71-8cf8-fd5893097c3a
20,methods20," However, recommendations suggest the use of 20 m Shuttle Run Test to assess cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as an international population health surveillance measure to offer further information on the health of pediatric populations [50]. Thirdly, another limitation is related to the lack of data on the individual’s timing of maturation (e.g., Tanner Stages), which could have provided a more accurate level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) [51]. Furthermore, self-report data were used to evaluated recreational ST in this study. Conversely, with regard to the strengths of our study, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to analyze the mediator role of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in the relation between ST and adherence to the MD.  5. Conclusions  The present findings suggest that having a high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and less recreational ST are associated with higher adherence to the MD.",ffa0b873-6519-4313-a5ed-054f431cef32
21,methods21," Furthermore, the mediation analysis indicated that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) mediates the relationship between recreational ST and adherence to the MD, slightly weakening this association. This knowledge could be essential for the appropriate and specific design of public health interventions that will contribute to the early adoption of Mediterranean dietary patterns. Likewise, these data indicate that intervention programs aimed at reducing recreational ST use and increasing cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may be important to promote healthy dietary patterns.
