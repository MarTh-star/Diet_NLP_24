0,methods0," The study design for the HYDRIA survey followed the recommendations of the European Health Examination Survey (European Health Examination Survey (EHES)) [18] and the European Food Safety Authority (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)) [19] for the collection of health and dietary data at a national level, allowing for intercountry comparisons. It was conducted according to the guidelines in the Helsinki declaration and national legislation on the protection of individual data. All individuals signed informed consent prior to the study initiation.  Eligible individuals were men and women aged 18 years and over residing permanently in Greece based on the latest Greek general census (2011). A two-stage stratified random sampling scheme was applied, with the primary sampling unit being the municipality/local community (first stage) and the final unit being the individual (second stage) for to select the HYDRIA representative survey sample.",59b003a3-0626-4e2f-86a5-bdeb0c99cb53
1,methods1," The HYDRIA survey sampling frame covered all the 51 prefectures of the 13 regions of the country [3].  The data collection included interviewer-administered questionnaires on sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, and medical history, while measurements of blood pressure, somatometric characteristics, and blood samples were collected by health professionals. Study centres, mainly including health care facilities close to the residences of individuals, were used for the data collection. The data collection started in June 2013 and was completed in December 2014. Overall, 1873 men and 2138 women, aged 18 to 94 years old, participated in the HYDRIA survey, with a 50% response rate. Details for the design, methodology, and data collection of the HYDRIA survey have been described elsewhere [3,4].",c097e386-5325-4837-bac2-6eb3111c34c7
2,methods2,"  Dietary intake was collected using two nonconsecutive 24 h dietary recalls (24-HDR) per participant and a nonquantitative food frequency questionnaire (food propensity questionnaire, frequency questionnaire (FPQ)). The two 24-HDRs were distributed over seasons (in group level) and days of the week to control variations in food consumption. The first 24-HDR (face-to-face interview) was carried out on the first day of the participants’ examination, while the second 24-HDR (by telephone) was performed approximately 15 to 30 days after the first recall. During a 24-HDR, participants were asked to report in detail all the food and beverages they had consumed the previous day. In addition, questions were asked about food preparation practices, types of foods (e.g., type of fat used during cooking, type of milk), and the amounts consumed. The 24-HDR data were collected by trained interviewers using a specially designed application, the Hellenic Health Foundation (HHF) Nutrition Tool.",4a4743eb-8060-4edb-a7c6-0d4b988f7d9f
3,methods3," The Hellenic Health Foundation (HHF) Nutrition Tool included a food list, facets, and descriptors of food items that were in line with both the LanguaL™ Food Description Thesaurus [20] and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)’s FoodEx2 classification system. A validated food photography atlas with pictures of 170 food items and recipes in different portions, standard portions sizes of specific foods, and household measures were used to help participants quantify the food, drinks, and dishes consumed [21].  In addition, participants were asked to report the frequency of consumption (never, less than 1 day per month, 1–3 days per month, 1 day per week, 2–3 days per week, 4–5 days per week, 6–7 days per week) of eighty-eight foods and dietary supplements in the previous year through an interviewer-administered, nonquantitative food frequency questionnaire (frequency questionnaire (FPQ)).",34a53306-735a-47d4-9be8-f36e4f67391c
4,methods4," The frequency questionnaire (FPQ) for the HYDRIA survey was developed and pilot-tested in the context of the PANEU project [22].  All the collected data are inputted and stored electronically on the Hellenic Health Foundation (HHF) central server anonymously and securely to protect participants’ privacy. The HYDRIA survey data are protected under applicable national law and by approval from the Hellenic Data Protection Authority (HDPA, www.dpa.gr, accessed on 9 January 2022) for the establishment and operation of a file registry of sensitive personal data under law N.2472/1997.  Statistical Analysis  Individuals who did not participate in any of the two 24-HDRs (n = 60) were excluded from the analyses. For calculating the energy intake and macronutrients, the foods consumed were linked through the Hellenic Health Foundation (HHF) nutrition tool to the HYDRIA Food Composition Table (H-FCT), which was created to accommodate the recorded consumption data.",9c05f708-42cf-4ced-8d92-a76a0d2e9973
5,methods5," For this purpose, the existing FCT [23,24] was enriched with more food items, and nutrients were further expanded and updated. Under-reporters in the HYDRIA survey were identified as 31% of men and 35% of women based on Schofield et al. and Golberg et al. equations [25,26,27]. For the calculation of under-reporters, we assumed a light physical activity level equal to 1.55 METs (based on metabolic equivalents) [28], considering that more than 60% of participants reported a light physical activity in the HYDRIA survey. Under-reporters were not excluded from the present analyses because their exclusion could include bias [29].",9a23951b-4d98-4398-bda9-9eea13e5e929
6,methods6,"  In the present analysis, we estimated the intake of energy and macronutrients (protein, glycaemic carbohydrates, dietary fibre, total fat, saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)), monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)), polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)), and alcohol) for the following thirteen food groups: vegetables (excluding potatoes), potatoes, legumes, fruits (without fresh fruit juices), cereals (including cereal products), dairy (including dairy products), meat (including meat products), fish (including seafood and fish products), eggs, fats and oils, nonalcoholic beverages, sugar and products, and alcoholic beverages, and eleven food subgroups: bread, pasta, rice, milk, yoghurt, cheese, poultry, red meat, olive oil, wine, and beer.",56a6902d-872e-4bb6-8eba-8e5bd4f81d85
7,methods7,"  The usual mean intake of energy, food groups and subgroups, and macronutrients was estimated using the mean of the two individual corresponding 24-HDRs under the assumption that two or more 24-HDRs per person give unbiased estimates of the single-day intakes [30]. The usual mean intake of food items and macronutrients was further energy-adjusted per 2000 kcal/day and expressed as a percentage contribution to the total energy intake (%EI), respectively, to evaluate their contribution to a diet with the same total energy intake and to compare subpopulations with different energy intakes.  To estimate the distribution (median, 25th, and 75th percentiles) of the usual intake of energy, food groups and subgroups, and macronutrients, we used the statistical method published by the National Cancer Institute (National Cancer Institute (NCI), Betsheda, MD, USA) [30,31,32].",de5e1741-2282-4ddc-a7b4-d70ea02f8997
8,methods8," The National Cancer Institute (NCI) method addresses biased estimates of other distribution values except for the mean due to the problem of within-individual variability from day-to-day variation in diet and other random sources of measurement error [30]. This method uses mixed-effects models to estimate the distribution of usual intake of single dietary components consumed on an almost daily basis by nearly everyone, such as nutrients, or episodically consumed components, such as foods, including a large proportion of zero intakes on any given day. A two-part model (considering the probability of consuming food on a particular day and the amount eaten on the consumption day) for repeated measures data with correlated random effects was used to estimate the usual intake distributions of all food items and alcohol, while a one-part model (considering only the amount eaten on a given day) was used to estimate the usual intake distributions of energy and macronutrients.",91b0166e-f45c-4957-9e11-c63cea888794
9,methods9,"  The adherence to the Greek traditional Mediterranean diet was assessed with a nine-point score for the consumption of vegetables, legumes, fruit and nuts, cereal, fish, meat, dairy, alcohol, and lipids (expressed as the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated lipids [33]) incorporated in a mixed-effects model developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the assessment of multicomponent dietary data [34,35]. More specifically, using the sex-specific median, a value of 0 was given to participants whose consumption of vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereals, and fish was below the median consumption, while a value of 1 was assigned in the opposite case. Study participants with a below-median consumption of meat and dairy products were assigned a value of 1, whereas a value of 0 was given to those with an above-median consumption. For ethanol, men consuming 10–50 g/day and women consuming 5–25 g/day were given a value of 1 [33].",9da308e2-4f48-4932-a023-e46a3d3bd859
10,methods10," The Mediterranean diet score was then categorized into three categories: low adherence, including individuals with a total score of 0 to 3 points; intermediate adherence, with a score of 4 to 5 points; and high adherence, with a score of 6 to 9 points [33].  To estimate the distribution of usual dietary intakes and Mediterranean diet score, all models were stratified by gender and included covariates for ten-year age groups (18–24 years, 25–34 years, to 75 years and older), education level (low, intermediate, high), and geographic area (Attiki, Northern Greece, Central Greece, and the Aegean islands and Crete). In addition to the estimation of the usual distribution intake of food groups and subgroups, the corresponding frequency food variables of frequency questionnaire (FPQ) were included in the models to supplement the food intake obtained from the two 24-HDRs. Weighting factors were applied in all models to achieve nationally representative results in the usual intakes.",d12e2164-3bad-4fbb-9203-6b30ade87f72
11,methods11," The weighting factors were calculated using the 2011 Greek census, considering the complex sampling study design and the response rate of participants by sex, age group, geographical region, and urbanization level.  3. Results  Table 1 shows selected sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics of the participants in the HYDRIA survey. Of note, in the study sample, 48.1% were men and 51.9% were women. The majority of participants were between 18 and 64 years old, with 77% men and 73.1% of women, versus 23% of men and 26.9% of women over 65 years old. Men reported having an intermediate level of education (41.1%), being employed (52%), having a moderate-intensity level of physical activity (3.7%), being more likely to be current smokers (39.4%), and being overweight (43.4%), while women reported having a low education level (44.1%), having a light-intensity level of physical activity (80.5%), being more likely to be never-smokers (54.8%), and being obese (35.6%).  3.1.",aa6adc72-583f-4c53-b305-5626868f70e0
12,methods12," Energy Intake  Table 2 shows the mean, median, 25th, and 75th percentiles of the usual daily energy intake of adult individuals in Greece. Mean and median energy intakes were 2192 kcal/day and 2109 kcal/day in men, while in women were 1530 kcal/day and 1473 kcal/day, respectively. Energy intake was reported lower among older men and women. After excluding the under-reporters, the mean energy intake was 374 kcal/day and 318 kcal/day higher in men and women, respectively.  3.2. Macronutrients Intake  Table 3 shows the percentage of contribution of macronutrients to the total energy intake (%EI) and the distribution of their usual daily intake by sex and age group. Overall, the contribution of protein, total fat, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), saturated fatty acids (SFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and alcohol to the total energy intake was 15.1%, 42.3%, 20.3%, 13.1%, 5.7%, 5.4% in men, and 15.2%, 42.9%, 20.6%, 13.5%, 5.9% and 1.8% in women, respectively.",2871b558-ad43-4be3-9ad2-57d32ad8f93c
13,methods13," The %EI from total carbohydrate consumption, including glycaemic carbohydrate and dietary fibre, was 36.9% (35.2% for glycaemic carbohydrate, 1.7% for dietary fibre) in men and 40.1% (38.2% for glycaemic carbohydrate, 1.9% for dietary fibre) in women. Older individuals (above 65 years old) had a higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) % energy intake than younger individuals (21.9–21.3% versus 20.1% of EI). The distribution of the usual intake of macronutrients intake, including median, 25th, and 75th percentiles, was higher in men and women below 65 years old compared to those above 65 years old.  3.3. Foods Intake  Table 4 shows the mean energy-adjusted intake and the distribution of the usual daily intake of food groups and selected subgroups by sex and age group. Considering the usual mean intakes in a diet of 2000 kcal/day, men and women over 65 years old consumed less meat and more fruit, vegetables, fish, and olive oil than those under 65 years old.",97cf8e45-1992-4cde-939d-3624ad836aef
14,methods14," Similar were the results for the distribution values of the usual intakes. Older men and women had higher median intakes of vegetables (m: 208 g/day, w: 161 g/day), fruits (m: 119 g/day, w: 133 g/day), legumes (m: 22 g/day, w: 11 g/day), and fish (m: 19 g/day, w: 20 g/day). Younger men and women consumed more meat (m:108 g/day, w: 64 g/day), cereals (m: 240 g/day, w: 159 g/day), nonalcoholic beverages (m: 136 g/day, w: 73 g/day), alcoholic beverages (m: 114 g/day, w: 32 g/day), fats and oils (m:46 g/day, w: 32 g/day), and sugar products (m: 25 g/day, w: 28 g/day). Among the main food groups (meat, cereals, dairy, and alcoholic beverages), the food subgroups of bread, pasta, red meat, cheese, wine, and beer were preferred by younger individuals, while yoghurt and milk were preferred by older adults. Men and women below 65 years had a median olive oil consumption of 35 g/day and 25 g/day, respectively, while the intakes of older men and women were 32 g/day and 24 g/day, respectively.",d8a5104d-4d44-4e6e-90c2-e2445f6d4088
15,methods15," When we compared the usual median intakes between sexes, men <65 years consumed more vegetables, potatoes, legumes, cereals, meat, fish, egg, lipids, and nonalcoholic and alcoholic beverages compared to women who consumed more fruits, dairy, and sugar products. The distribution of results was similar in men and women ≥ 65 years, including higher intakes of dairy and fish in men and women, respectively.  3.4. Adherence to the Greek Traditional Mediterranean Diet  The distribution of study participants according to sex, age, geographic region, and categories of Mediterranean diet score is shown in Table 5.

16,methods16,"5% of participants under 65 years old were included in the high category of the Mediterranean diet score. Of note, in the total HYDRIA cohort, 31.3% of men and 25.7% of women are characterized by a high adherence (score of 6–9 points) to the Mediterranean diet. Among geographic regions, individuals in Attiki had lower scores, with 35.6% and 25.7% of individuals included in the low and high categories of the Mediterranean diet, respectively, followed by the islands of Egeo and Kriti (33.1% in the low and 27.7% in the high category).  4. Discussion  The HYDRIA study is the first national health and nutrition survey conducted on a large representative sample of the adult population in Greece, providing evidence for the dietary and health status of the population [3].",0c3e9afc-bf06-47b7-8f0e-852402004c40
17,methods17," Our results suggest that older Greeks were more adherent to the Greek traditional Mediterranean diet, consuming more vegetables, legumes, fruits, fish, and monounsaturated fats (primarily olive oil) than younger Greeks, who reported higher consumption of meat, mainly red meat, alcohol, cereals, saturated fats, and sugar products (particularly women). Regarding alcoholic beverages, older adults consumed more wine than beer, while younger ones consumed both equally. Individuals living in Attiki, followed by those in the islands of Egeo and Kriti, had lower adherence to the Greek traditional Mediterranean diet.  The above results are in line with previous findings from the Greek European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort [36] and the PA.ME.D.Y study [5]. In the PA.ME.DY study, younger individuals who were employed and had higher education were more adherent to a Western diet pattern characterized by the consumption of red meat, animal fats, and cheese.",b68eb22b-f85d-4591-83c4-017771327ccd
18,methods18," On the other hand, older participants who were less educated and lived outside of Attiki followed a diet closer to traditional dietary patterns, which included the consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, seafood, and whole grains [5]. Findings from the Greek European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort indicated that younger adults were more likely to gradually abandon the Greek traditional Mediterranean diet, consuming more red meat and fewer fruits and legumes [36]. The current findings of the HYDRIA survey could explain the high prevalence of obesity, chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, CVD), and their relevant risk factors (hypertension, high blood cholesterol, and glucose levels) observed among younger adults in Greece [3,4,9,10].  About one out of three adults (28.3%) was found to have high adherence to the Greek traditional Mediterranean diet. The percentage was lower among younger participants (25.5%) than the older ones (39.7%).",ec7185d6-eb69-45de-9520-5652f94a28e2
19,methods19," These results could point to negative consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality among younger people. Specifically, several national [33,37,38,39,40] and international studies [41,42,43,44,45,46] suggested that lower adherence to traditional diets similar to the Mediterranean diet was associated with increased all-cause mortality and risk of various chronic diseases. The Greek European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, which included 22,043 individuals, found an association between following the Greek traditional Mediterranean diet and a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR:0.75, 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.87), death due to coronary heart disease (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.94), and death due to cancer (HR:0.76, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.98) [33]. Furthermore, a two-unit increase in the modified Mediterranean diet score was associated with a significant 8% reduction in overall mortality among older Europeans.",aa840bb0-75dd-43a6-9754-1d7d28e12984
20,methods20," At the same time, participants from Greece and Spain had a stronger association [46].  4.1. Comparison with Nutrient Reference Values  The higher energy intakes reported by the male population in the HYDRIA survey, which decreased with age, were consistent with those reported by other European national nutrition surveys [47,48]. The contribution of total fat in adults was found to be higher than the 20–35% dietary reference intake ranges (RI) suggested by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [49]. Overall, total fat intake represents 42–43% of total energy intake in men and women in the HYDRIA survey, of which 20–22% of the total energy intake of individuals was represented by monounsaturated fatty acids.",5c54c073-102b-4982-812b-e6ec1a8e45e7
21,methods21," In addition, 25% of the older population, both men and women, had lower protein daily average intakes (51 g/day and 41 g/day) than the recommended daily average requirements for adults (AR), (57 g/day and 48 g/day), calculated based on European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)’s recommendations [49]. It is of notice that the recommended daily protein intake is adequate for meeting the protein needs of 97.5% of the healthy adult population, as indicated by international bodies such as European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), World Health Organization (WHO)/FAO/UNU, IOM, DASH, and NNR, and is even higher (0.8–0.83 g/kg/bw/d) [50,51,52,53,54]. Moreover, the most recent recommended reference values for protein intake by DASH and NNR emphasize the higher protein needs of older adults (1 g/kg/bw/d and 15–20% of energy intake) and suggest a protein increase with decreasing energy intake.",97a19688-f9a9-4d98-abaf-e54acc8e3c77
22,methods22," In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-PANACEA study, a higher percentage of energy from protein intake was associated with a 23–24% increased risk of being overweight or obese in normal weight and overweight individuals [45]. The above findings could be related to the high percentage (~70%) of overweight or obese adults in Greece, according to the preliminary results of the HYDRIA survey [3,4].  4.2. Comparison with Dietary Food Guidelines  To improve overall health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer, World Health Organization (WHO) dietary guidelines recommend more than 400 g of fruit and vegetables per day [55] for adults, while AICR/WRCF recommends that red meat intake should not exceed 350–500 g per week [56]. Based on the percentile intakes found in the current study, the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables was not met by 68% of men and 75% of women in Greece, i.e.",a8f6ab52-4dbe-45d5-942f-70be95024111
23,methods23,", 32% of men and 25% of women consumed >400 g of fruits and vegetables per day (Figure 1). Men, especially younger men, did not follow the recommendations for red meat intake. About 50% of men overall (60% of men <65 years and 10% of men ≥65 years) ate more than 350 g (or 50 g/day), and 23% of men overall consumed more than 500 g of red meat per week (data for 500 g not shown in Figure 1). Among the factors that may influence these food choices are the globalization of the food supply, the urbanization of life, and general improvements in people’s socioeconomic conditions, which also lead to the increasing availability of animal-origin foods [57,58]. More and more international organizations are recommending limiting the consumption of meat and other sources of animal-protein foods and urging people to follow more environmentally friendly diets, which not only benefit health but are also associated with a lower ecological burden [55,59].",3227a409-f38f-4698-a44a-3695f256ac1b
24,methods24," According to the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems, the Mediterranean diet, which traditionally includes low consumption of animal products, is a diet that maximizes longevity, improves health-related quality of life, and at the same time is an ecologically sustainable and environmentally friendly way to eat [60]. The Greek traditional Mediterranean diet does not eliminate any food groups but rather encourages individuals to have a more plant-based diet. On the other hand, other diets that have gained popularity in recent years, such as the ketogenic diet, focus solely on restricting the percentages of macronutrients rather than their sources. Long-term evidence for the health benefits of such diets is weak, and low-carbohydrate and high-fat (in terms of saturated fats) diets have been related to increased mortality and cardiovascular diseases [61].",363ae56c-9eba-4395-8ea2-acfa4fab337a
25,methods25,"  It is essential to mention that the HYDRIA survey implemented a harmonized protocol among EU Member States that generated data directly comparable to that of other European countries. Among the main strengths of the HYDRIA survey were the national representative sample and the standardized data collection. To collect dietary data, a specially designed dietary software application, the Hellenic Health Foundation (HHF) Nutrition Tool, and a food composition table specifically designed for this project, the H-FCT, were used. The current study examined the usual intake of a wide range of food groups and selected subgroups. The differentiation between refined and whole grains in the cereal and products food groups was not possible for the current analysis. We only estimated the usual intake of adult men and women and not the dietary intake of children or adolescents, which was later collected in two additional studies.",f2fac367-1282-4875-98c5-1a1256816524
26,methods26," Overall, dietary and other health-related data were collected by interviewer-administered questionnaires. However, the HYDRIA survey has a cross-sectional design and thus cannot be used to prove causal relations, but it does contribute to identifying problems with a significant impact on the health of the population in the country.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, the HYDRIA survey included a large national representative sample of the population in Greece that provided insights into the dietary behaviours of adults. Younger adults consume more meat, dairy, and alcohol, which are traditionally consumed at moderate-to-low levels in the Mediterranean diet, than fruit, legumes, and vegetables, which were consumed more by older individuals. Furthermore, adults did not meet international dietary recommendations for the consumption of red meat, fruit, and vegetables.",9cd7dc70-9b0b-4160-80c0-c175634f6b83
27,methods27, Younger generations in Greece seem to move away from food choices included in the beneficial components of the Greek traditional Mediterranean diet at a time when other countries are modifying their diets to support the Mediterranean dietary pattern. ,088ef2c0-1703-4074-be74-a59d480725fd
