0,background0," Several findings suggest neuroinflammation as a contributing factor for the onset of psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and anxiety. There is increasing evidence pointing out that the Mediterranean diet influences brain and behavior. Mediterranean herbs and spices have been shown to be within those components of the Mediterranean diet involved in cognitive enhancement. Thus, we investigated the influence of Mediterranean natural extracts (Mediterranean natural extracts (MNE)), Rosemary extract (RE) and Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE)), on cognitive behavior.

Zebrafish  A total of 80 adult (6–8 months old; 3–4 cm long; wild-type) male and female short-finned Danio rerio zebrafish (0.4–1 g) of heterogeneous genetic background were obtained from ZF Biolabs (Madrid, Spain). Fish were kept at 28.5 ± 0.5 °C on a 14:10-h light/dark cycles [25] in a standalone aquatic flow-through system (Dohse Aquaristik GmbH & Co. KG, Grafschaft-Gelsdorf, Germany), provided with constant filtration and aeration, at a density of 2 fish per liter. Water used in the system consisted of reverse osmosis water supplemented with 0.8 g/L sea salts (OSMO FIT, Hobby, Germany).",4164c0c4-5cd6-4554-be4f-f916c3d23954
2,methods1," Adult fish were fed daily with commercially available flake fish food (Ocean Nutrition, Newark, U.S.A.) and brine shrimps. Fish were acclimated to the aquatic system for 2 weeks before experiment begins. Behavioral tests took place during the light phase between 08:00 and 18:00 h. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their discomfort. After experiments, zebrafish were euthanized by hypothermia.  Rats  Male and female (3 weeks old; 80 g) Sprague–Dawley rats (Envigo RMS Spain, Barcelona, Spain) were maintained in the local animal unit. Food and water were available ad libitum and rats were maintained on a 12:12-h light/dark cycles with temperature at 22 ± 1 °C. Male and female rats were housed in separate animal rooms to avoid hormonal effects on the cognitive tests [26].

6,methods5," Animals underwent behavioral testing immediately after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment (Fig. 1). Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE) and RE treatments were based on previous studies where similar doses were applied [41, 42].  Behavioral testing  Zebrafish  Zebrafish underwent a behavior test battery spread over 5 days: T-maze on days one and two; the novel object preference (novel object preference (NOP)) on day five. All behavioral tests were performed in the morning between 9.00 and 12.00 h.  T-maze  T-maze was used to measure spatial memory as described previously [28]. The apparatus consisted of a white plexiglass maze with a T shape, filled with 10 cm of tank water. The long arm (50 × 10 cm) was intersected at one of its ends by a short arm (50 × 10 cm). One of the ends of the short arm opens to a larger reservoir (30 cm square) 5 cm deeper than the rest of the maze. The reservoir was enriched with artificial plants and color stones to offer a favorable habitat to the fish.",564f172e-8748-4a53-a9b2-54ed81c6dec9
7,methods6," By nature zebrafish would spend more time in the reservoir than in the rest of the maze [28]. The other end of the long arm was connected to a starting zone (30 × 10 cm) by a white removable door (Fig. 2). The protocol consists in three trials [T-Maze T1 (TMT1), TMT2 and TMT3]. During each trial, fish were individually placed in the starting zone for 1 min with the door closed. Then, the start box was raised and lowered after the fish exited. During the TMT1, fish were given a maximum of 4 min to fully explore the maze and encounter the reservoir where they were left for at least 20 s before the end of the trial. Each fish repeated the trial 3 h (TMT2) and 24 h (TMT3) later. After each trial, fish were returned to their home tank. All trials were video-recorded, and the time needed to find the reservoir [transfer latency time (TLT)] was quantified using a digital tracking system (ANY-Maze, version 4.82).Fig. 2 Mediterranean natural extracts improved memory retention in zebrafish.",770541e1-0095-4ea0-a7e4-ea09924c1a02

Briefly, zebrafish were subjected to 5 min of acclimation to the novel tank (29 × 14 × 18 cm tank filled with 14 L of tank water) followed by 10 min of habituation to two identical objects (training phase). After a recovery period of 10 min, one of the two original objects was randomly replaced with a novel object and interactions were monitored for an additional 10 min (testing phase).",99388d65-86cc-4425-a03d-d0c732ef739c
9,methods8," To avoid thigmotaxis influence, the objects were placed one in front of the other in an equal distance between the center of the tank and the walls. An 8.4 cm × 8.4 cm box was superimposed over each object and the time the fish spent within the boxes was recorded and scored automatically (ANY-Maze, version 4.82).  Rats  Behavioral tests were carried out during the fifth [Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), novel object recognition (NOR) and open field (OF)] and sixth (Morris Water Maze (MWM)) week of Mediterranean natural extracts (MNE) administration, when the animals were eight and nine weeks of age, respectively (Fig. 1). Before each behavioral test, rats were habituated to the test room for 30 min. All experiments were carried out between 9:00 am and 2:00 pm.  Elevated Plus Maze (EPM)  Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) was performed to assess retention memory as described previously [30] with some modification.",a5a625e7-20b7-4b50-b790-2edf8b5fbf10
10,methods9," The maze consisted of two open arms (50 × 10 com) and two enclosed arms (50 × 10 × 40 cm) that all extended from a common central platform (10 × 10 cm). The apparatus was raised 60 cm above the floor on a central pedestal. On the training phase, rats were placed individually at the end of the open arm, facing it away from the central platform. The time that the animal took to move from the open arm to one of the two enclosed arms (4 paws in) was recorded. The same procedure was repeated 60 min (acquisition) and 24 h (retention) after training. To become acquainted with the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), if the rat failed to enter the enclosed arm within 120 s, it was guided to one of them and let it to explore the maze for further 60 s before to be returned to its home cage (training phase only).

13,methods12,"  Morris Water Maze (MWM)  The Morris Water Maze (MWM) is a test of spatial learning and reference memory for rodents that relies on distal cues to navigate from start locations around the perimeter of an open swimming arena to locate a submerged escape platform [33]. The swimming arena consisted of a circular metal pool (150 cm diameter × 58 cm tall) filled with tap water (23-25ºC, 40-cm deep). The maze was divided geographically into four quadrants: Northeast (NE), Northwest (NW), Southeast (SE) and Southwest (SW), and four starting positions, North (N), East (E), West (W), South (S), were located at equal distances along the pool rim. A circular white platform (10 cm diameter) was placed in the center of the NW quadrant and submerged 1.5 cm below the water surface. Water was white colored with a non-toxic white paint to hide the platform. Distal cues were arranged around the maze to provide landmarks that the animals could use to navigate to the platform.",5eb0c26a-821b-4f81-aac3-157ff0bcceea
14,methods13,"  Acquisition training  Rats underwent five days of training that consisted of four trials/day. At the beginning of each trial rats were individually placed in one of the starting positions (N, E, S, or W) facing the wall of the tank and allowed to explore the maze for 60 s. A different starting position was used for each of the 4 trials on a given day arranged in a semi-random pattern. Once rats reached the platform, they were held there for 20 s. If the platform was not found within the given time, rats were gently assisted to the platform by the experimenter and detained there for 20 s.  Removal phase  On day six (removal) the platform was removed, and the rats were allowed to freely explore the maze for 60 s. Rats were individually placed into the quadrant diagonally opposite to the one originally hosting the platform.",f0619bc4-d32c-43dc-b321-35a856102376

17,results0," Mediterranean natural extracts improved memory retention in zebrafish  T-maze  The T-maze was used to assess memory retention in zebrafish. For RE effects on zebrafish, RM-ANOVA revealed an overall learning improvement over time (f (2,76) = 6.928, p = 0.002) and a significant time by treatment interaction (f (4,76) = 4.513, p = 0.003), (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, significant time by treatment interaction was mainly due to the treatment effect lasting for 24 h. In contrast, in the control groups cognitive abilities returned to basal at 24 h time point. Accordingly, LSD’s multiple comparisons post hoc analysis showed that RE supplementation reduced TLT of 50% (100 mg/L) and of 30% (250 mg/L) at 24 h time point, compared to controls (Fig. 2A). For Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE) effects on zebrafish, RM-ANOVA revealed an overall learning improvement over time (f (4,74) = 15.087, p = 0.000) and a significant time by treatment interaction (f (4,74) = 4.385, p = 0.00), (Fig. 2A).",b49746e6-152f-4cac-a404-96112fc9e375
18,results1," Similar to the RE effects, significant time by treatment interaction was mainly due to the long lasting effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE) up to 24 h. Post hoc analysis showed that TLT was higher in zebrafish treated with Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE) (250 mg/L) at baseline compared to both controls and Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE) 100 mg/L-treated zebrafish. Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE) (100 mg/L) reduced TLT of 25% at 3 h time point compared to controls. Moreover, Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE), at both concentrations, reduced TLT of 57% at 24 h time point compared to controls (Fig. 2A). Similarly, AUC analysis confirmed the improved learning in both RE- and Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE)-treated zebrafish (1-way ANOVA: f (4,75) = 3.092, p = 0.021; Fig. 2B).

30,discussion1," However, expanding the range of experimental domains with the use of additional models, is now considered as an important strategy for translational neuroscience research [34]. Recent data suggest zebrafish as an emerging successful model to study cognitive phenotypes and central nervous system (CNS) related drug discovery [35–37]. Accordingly, our behavioral results show that both Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE) and RE improved retention memory as indicated by the T-maze test. Similarly, RE has been shown to improve cognitive function in a zebrafish model of amnesia induced by scopolamine [38]. We also found that improvement in retention memory was best at the lowest concentration used (100 mg/L). This suggests that at high doses (250 mg/L) both Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE) and RE may have off-target activity. Ceiling effects have been previously observed with other natural extracts in rats [39, 40].",79b0c190-f55c-4b6b-af67-46e6a9dea824
31,discussion2," Interestingly, the results obtained in zebrafish correlated with those observed in healthy male rats. Specifically, RE demonstrated improvements in spatial learning as indicated by the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Moreover, a better recall memory was observed in Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE) treated rats at 24 h, but not 1 h, from the training phase of the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) task. In a similar study, Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE) improved memory functions in a mice model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation [41]. Moreover, RE has been shown to rescue learning and spatial memory deficits in a rat model of epilepsy induced by treatment with kainic acid [42]. Interestingly, a randomized clinical trial observed that RE treatment positively affected memory performance, anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in 34 Iranian university students [43].",2b9deeb2-6dd5-460f-a309-baeec1c40552
32,discussion3," On the other hand, no improvements were found in recognition memory either in zebrafish or in rats as assessed by the novel object preference (NOP) and the novel object recognition (NOR) tests, respectively. There is a wide agreement that both spatial learning and long-term memory are largely dependent on the integrity of the hippocampus [44, 45], whereas its role in recognition memory is controversial. A number of studies suggest no effect of hippocampal lesion in recognition memory [46, 47], while other studies reported significant impairments [48, 49]. Moreover, it is suggested that tasks of recognition memory are mainly supported by cortical structures adjacent to the hippocampus and that are less dependent to hippocampal malfunctioning [50, 51]. For instance, the hippocampus receives projections from the adjacent perirhinal and entorhinal cortices which have been shown to severely disrupt recognition memory in rodents [50].",2ed79e78-3877-4df6-8585-a7b025286cf5
33,discussion4," Thus, our data may suggest that the observed improvements in spatial learning and long-term memory induced by Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE) and RE may be due to their action on neuronal circuitries specifically involved in the regulation of hippocampal-dependent tasks both in zebrafish and rats. However, it should be mentioned that improvements in recognition memory induced by RE and Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract (GGRE) have been previously reported in mice [41, 52]. The discrepancy with our findings may be found in the applied animal model of cognitive impairment and the type of rodents used. Further analysis is warranted to shed more light on this issue.  Growing evidence suggests that females are more susceptible to the development of mood and cognitive deficits compared to males, leading to a higher risk for psychopathologies [53].",fe683206-1308-4ae0-b385-c54a6028fc57
34,discussion5," Neuroinflammation has been indicated as one of the main factors that contribute to sex differences in psychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, depression and anxiety [54, 55]. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections represent a widely used animal model of neuroinflammation that has been shown to disrupt memory and cognition in rodents [1, 56]. We observed that, at the chosen dose of 300 ug/kg, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) chronic administration impaired females’ learning, and cognition of a greater extent compared to male rats. Interestingly, RE chronic treatment demonstrated protective cognitive effects in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) chronic injection. However, such effect was blunted by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in male rats. Such discrepancy may be found on the different immunological response between genders that in turn may be associated with the gender-specific outcomes from RE treatment. Further research is warranted.",61fe4645-370f-44a2-97d8-a2ca199e25d2
35,discussion6,"  In conclusion, we demonstrated that zebrafish can be considered as a valuable preclinical model for drug discovery in neuroscience. The results obtained in zebrafish are, to a great extent, comparable to those observed in healthy rats. Moreover, we provided further evidence that neuroinflammation is involved in the regulation of learning and cognition using a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced memory impairment. Notably, the protective effects of the selected Mediterranean natural extracts (MNE) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced memory impairment were gender-specific. Finally, this study shed light on the beneficial role of Mediterranean natural extracts (MNE) administration in enhancing cognitive abilities both in healthy rodents and rats exhibiting cognitive impairment.",f5108d03-9d67-4bcd-b420-382a0ec17301
