0,introduction0,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia. The most common symptom of AD is early memory decline and cognitive deficit. This memory loss is caused by malfunction and death of brain neurons involved in forming new memories (1-3) .  Currently, over 36.5 million people are affected by dementia worldwide, the majority of which are AD-related. Approximately, 5–7 million new AD cases are being diagnosed yearly in the elderly population (4). It is estimated that the worldwide prevalence of AD will triple by 2050 (5). More importantly, the high economic burden of AD would be affecting patients and their family and community.   AD develops as a result of multiple factors including aging over 65 and having apolipoprotein E (apolipoprotein E (APOE)) ε4 gene, family history, mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), cardiovascular disease risk factors (e.g.",56c21d1a-68c4-44b2-b826-4ca769e6c52b
1,introduction1," smoking, obesity in midlife and diabetes, midlife hypertension) and lower educational attainment (1).  The core cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) biomarkers of AD are remarkable increase in T-tau and P-tau along with a considerable decrease in Aβ42 (6). Moreover, the presence of senile plaques comprised of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau are other important features of AD (7, 8).   In view of the high prevalence AD and the increasing burden of dementia and the lack of progress in developing an effective medication for AD, searching for new drugs seems to be of ample significance.   Epidemiological studies point out the important role of diet in prevention and improvement of AD (9). In Traditional Persian Medicine (Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM)), there exist multiple dietary guidelines to prevent and alleviate dementia and memory impairment.",0594673c-8259-4158-be94-79f9f947b067
2,introduction2," Eminent Persian physicians including Ibn-Sina (Avicenna; 980–1037 AD), Razi (Rhazes; 854–925 AD) Jorjani (1042–1136 AD), and Aqili Khorasani (18th century) have discussed dementia and its etiology along with medicinal and nutritional strategies for treatment of the disease in their medical textbooks (10-12). Given the great importance of various traditional medical systems in identifying new medications and nutraceuticals especially in recent decades, considering Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM)-reported food items would be useful in finding new drugs and dietary sources for the treatment of different ailments.   Herein, we aim to study Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM)-recommended plant and animal-based food items for the treatment of dementia. In addition, epidemiological and pharmacological evidence supporting the effects of Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM)-recommended foods in preventing and improving cognitive and memory performance will be discussed.

3,methods0,"Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) anti-dementia food items were obtained from major Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) texts including Canon of Medicine by Avicenna (12), Al-Hawi fi’l-Tibb (The Continence) by Rhazes (10), Kamel al-Sina’ah al-Tibbiyah (The Perfect Art of the Medicine) by Ahvazi (13), Zakhireh Kharazmshahi (Treasure of Kharazmshahi) and Al-Aghraz al-Tibbiah (Medical Goals and Allaii’s Discussions) by Jorjani (11), Hedayat al-Mota’allemin fi al-Tibb (An Educational Guide for Medical Students) by Akhawayni (14), Makhzan al-Adwiah (Drug Treasure) by Aqili (15) and Exir-e-Azam by Chashti (16). Following Persian and Arabic keywords were used to search the mentioned Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) textbooks:“Nesyan”, “Faramoshti”, “Faramoshtkari”, “Taqviat hafezeh”, “Fesaad al-zekr”, “Fesad al-hefz” and “Alhefz”.",59e72b17-3287-45a6-9d3d-c2e823eca64d

Soltani (18), ‘Explanation of Dioscorides’ Book’ by Ibn-Beythar, ‘Qamus al-qanun fi’l tibb’ by Abdol-hamid, and ‘Encyclopedia of Medicinal Plants: Arabic–English–French–German–Latin’ by M. Hayek (19). In the next step, an extensive search on scientific databases such as Google scholar, Pubmed, Scopus and Science direct was carried out using the Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM)-reported foods of herbal and animal source to retrieve epidemiological and pharmacological studies supporting their anti-AD properties together with the relevant mechanisms of action.",225621a1-dd77-471d-995c-ae53a177e3c0
5,methods2,"    The pathophysiology of AD   Fibrillar Aβ is the main component of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (20). Two common isoforms of Aβ are Aβ40 (the more common form) and Aβ42 (the more amyloidogenic but the less common form) (21).  A protease enzyme is α-secretase that cleave amyloid precursor protein (amyloid precursor protein (APP)) to produces the non-amyloidogenic soluble amyloid precursor protein α (samyloid precursor protein (APP)α) (22). samyloid precursor protein (APP)α have been shown to promote the growth of cultured neurons under physiological and non-physiological conditions such as Aβ toxicity and glucose or oxygen deprivation (23). In AD, during amyloidogenic process, Aβ is generated through the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases (22).",c5af3eac-92a9-4986-8697-e53ecc5d69ae
6,methods3," In this pathway, β-secretase also known as β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), first cleaves the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) protein to generate samyloid precursor protein (APP)β (an extracellular fragment) and amyloid precursor protein (APP)-β-CTF (C99; a membrane-associated carboxyl-terminal fragment). amyloid precursor protein (APP)-β-CTF is then cleaved by γ-secretase to form Aβ fragments which are then released into the extracellular space (24). Consequently, Aβ peptides aggregate into soluble oligomers and then unify to produce insoluble β-sheet fibrils which are deposited in diffuse senile plaques (25).  Given the important role of β-and γ-secretases in Aβ generation, inhibition of these enzymes would be a principle therapeutic target for decreasing cerebral Aβ levels in patients with AD. Activation of α-secretase is also considered a therapeutic strategy for Aβ reduction (26).",eea8b448-52a7-486d-87ba-80394ec54c98
7,methods4,"   Tau proteins are proteins that serve to stabilize microtubules. However, tauopathy plays important role in AD pathogenesis (27). Alterations in the brain levels of tau or its structure can affect its physiological function. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-mediated hyperphosphorylation of tau could lead to self-aggregation into paired helical filaments (PHFs). These tau assemblies may result in loss of neuronal synaptic contacts followed by neuronal death and lysis which in turn causes the release of tau into the extracellular space. The liberated tau then binds to molecules like sulfoglycosaminoglycans (sGAG) which promote its polymerization. Upon glycation, tau polymers could aggregate to form NFTs which ultimately lead to neuron loss in AD (28).   Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that dysregulated neuronal cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme (COX-2) activity may affect normal neuronal activity, resulting in cognitive impairment.",e21b121d-15e6-4e3a-bbf3-bff7b6ac487a
8,methods5," In fact, PGE 2 and soluble Aβ 42 oligomers act in synergy to disrupt hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP)(29). PGE 2 also mediates the potentiation of γ-secretase activity and subsequently, Aβ peptide generation (22). Moreover, memory deficits has been shown to be aggravated by increased COX-2 activity in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-PS1 mice ((29). Therefore, COX inhibitors can be beneficial in the management of AD.  Acetylcholinesterase is a hydrolase enzyme that hydrolyzes choline esters such as acetylcholin and possesses a crucial role in acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission (30). It is evidenced that plasma AChE activity is increased in subjects with early AD. Moreover, AChE may possibly play a role in Aβ fibrillogenesis (31).   Microglia, the brain’s tissue macrophage, are key players of the immune and inflammatory responses of the CNS. Microglia have the responsibility to provide immune surveillance and migrate in response to pathogens and injuries (32).",101cab37-4b25-47b4-93e5-244342fcaaee
9,methods6," Moreover, under pathological conditions, the activation of microglia maintains CNS homeostasis. However, during aging, chronic microglial activation could damage neurons through the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, suppressing microglial activation is considered a potential therapeutic goal in AD management (33).  Currently, only a few drugs including AChEIs, rivastigmine, galantamine, tacrine and donepezil and a Nmalondialdehyde (MDA) receptor antagonist, memantine are approved by US Food and Drug Administration (Food and Drug Administration (FDA)), for the treatment of cognitive symptoms of AD (25).   Plant- and animal-based foods recommended by Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) for treatment of dementia and memory impairment   Several plant foods and animal products have been suggested by Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) to be effective in prevention and treatment of memory loss. Plant-based Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) food items are listed in Table 1.",e29ca46c-e498-429c-b468-ea7abae521a8
10,methods7," Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM)-reported animal-based food items to cure memory impairment include whey, fish, fish eggs, egg yolk, birds meat and brain, lamb and kid (goat) meat, cow and gout milk, barley soup, and honey (10-12, 16, 34).   Allium sativum  L.   Garlic, a member of Amaryllidaceae, has long been used as a food seasoning and a medicinal plant (35). Several studies reported neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities of garlic (32). In vitro, ethyl acetate fraction of aged garlic extract exhibited a high 2,2’-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (acid) diammonium salt (ABTS)) radical scavenging and malondialdehyde (malondialdehyde (MDA)) inhibitory activities. Moreover, ethyl acetate fraction significantly reduced Intracellular reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) accumulation induced by Aβ treatment in PC12 cells. The fraction also protected PC12 cells against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (35).  Chauhan et al.",f04b4bcf-8c9c-4243-86b8-95788a88902a
11,methods8," investigated the anti-amyloidogenic effects of dietary supplementation with aged garlic extract (40 mg/kg/d for 4 weeks) in a mouse model of AD that overexpresses the human amyloid precursor protein 695 carrying Swedish double mutation (K670N/M671L) (Tg2576). Results show 64% reduction in cerebral levels of samyloid precursor protein (APP)a, and ∼21-fold elevation of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in untreated Tgs compared to wild type and littermate controls. Dietary garlic resulted in a 25% increase in samyloid precursor protein (APP)a levels and 31% and 32% decreased in Aβ40 and Aβ42, compared to untreated Tgs (36). In another experiment, dietary aged garlic extract (2%) and its main compounds S-allyl-cysteine (Figure 1, 1) and diallyl-disulfide (2) (20 mg/kg) reduced cerebral plaques, soluble and fibrillar Aβ-species, cerebral inflammation, and phosphorylation-induced conformational alteration in tau protein (via GSK-3β inhibition) (37).",d425b37d-1841-48a3-a454-52cb75a70ec2
12,methods9," Moreover, the aqueous extract of fresh garlic not only inhibited the formation of Aβ fibrils in a concentration and time dependent manner but was also cable of defibrillating Aβ fibrils. The boiled aqueous garlic extract also retained its anti-amyloidogenic activity while its fibril degrading activity was significantly lost which suggests that anti-amyloidogenic activity of garlic is non-enzymatic (38).   Jeong et al investigated the effects of ethyl acetate fraction from aged garlic ethanol extract (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) on Aβ-induced memory and learning impairment in mice using Y-maze test and passive avoidance task. It was shown that ethyl acetate fraction attenuated memory impairment in a dose-dependent manner. It also improved the Aβ-induced deficit in the passive avoidance test (35).   Alpinia officinarum  Hance , Alpinia galanga ( L. )  Willd   Rhizomes Galangals (Zingiberaceae) are plants traditionally used in cuisines and as a medicine for a variety of diseases.   Singh et al.",257fc9b2-288d-4f2d-9caa-66d2a0089889
13,methods10," investigated the effects of different fractions of A. galanga rhizomes (n-hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate at 200 and 400 mg/kg) on cognitive performance of amnestic mice (Aβ(25–35)-induced AD type) using open field and water maze tests. All fractions could Increase habituation memory and decrease escape latency which indicates the cognitive enhancement. AChE level in brain tissue homogenate was also decreased after treatment with A. galanga. Increased levels of Na+/K+-ATPase and antioxidant activity suggests improvement in brain membrane integrity and free radical scavenging activity. Chloroform fraction which contains mostly 1′δ-1′-acetoxyeugenol acetate (3), was found to be the most potent fraction (39). Total extract of A. officinarum also exhibited 41.3% AChE inhibition at concentration of 300 µg/ml (40).  7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenyl-4E-hepten-3-one (AO-1) (4), a diarylheptanoid isolated from A.",54862d90-7345-4571-aa3f-26293a5ee60e
14,methods11," officinarum, has been found to possess strong effects on neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth. Moreover, AO-1 was able to reduce apoptotic levels and oxidative stress induced by Aβ. The compound also exhibited anti-caspase and dendrite protective activities via activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin pathways (41).    Brassica nigra L.   Black mustard seeds are commonly used as a spice worldwide. It is also used for the treatment of a number of CNS diseases (42). Jazayeri et al. reported that seeds of mustard exhibited moderate AChE inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 135.0 ± 5.91 μg/ml (43).  Sulforaphane (5) is an isothiocyanate present in mustard. Kim et al. showed that sulforaphane was able to ameliorate cognitive function in Aβ-induced acute AD mouse models of Y-maze and passive avoidance behavior. However, this effect was not associated to inhibition of Aβ aggregation (44).    Cicer arietinum  L.",4254b917-6999-400d-88cf-7ac374f99fab
15,methods12,"   Chickpea is an important food legume from Fabaceae which is considered as a good source of dietary protein (45). In Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM), chickpea has been used as a valuable functional food and a medicinal plant.  Wahby et al. investigated the protective effects of the isoflavones fraction obtained from chickpea extract (10 mg/Kg for 6 weeks) against AlCl3-induced neurodegeneration. The results showed that chickpea attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytnokines, suppressed amyloidogenesis, and maintained the AChE activity and ER-β expression. It also attenuated the oxidative stress and ameliorated the histological changes induced by AlCl3 (46).  It has been found that chickpea is a rich source of folate. Several studies revealed that low plasma levels of folate were associated with AD (47). It has been suggested that folic acid deficiency could impair neural DNA repair, and subsequently sensitize the neurons to oxidative damage induced by Aβ (48).",86118032-bdfe-40a7-91a4-5e7f0f05793a
16,methods13,"   Cinnamomum cassia  (L.) J.Presl   Aqueous cinnamon extract has been found to inhibit the formation of Aβ oligomers and prevent the toxicity of Aβ on neuronal PC12 cells. In an AD fly model using Drosophila melanogaster, the extract improved the reduced longevity, fully recovered impaired locomotion and destroyed tetrameric species of Aβ in brain of the flies. Moreover, cinnamon extract (100 µg/ml of the extract in drinking water) markedly decreased 56 kDa Aβ oligomers, reduced plaques and improved cognitive behavior in a transgenic aggressive mice model (49).  It is stablished that insulin resistance causes memory impairment. Anderson et al. investigated the effects of cinnamon-enriched diet on behavior, insulin signaling and AD-associated mRNA expression in the brain of rats fed a high fat/high fructose diet (HF/HFr) to induce insulin resistance for 12 weeks. The results showed that decreased insulin sensitivity induced by HF/HFr was reversed in cinnamon-fed animals.",9a1612e2-65fe-4f1b-88bc-f7046b808cf2
17,methods14," Moreover, cinnamon-fed rats showed more activity in a Y maze test than control and HF/HFr diets-fed animals. HF/HFr diet caused more anxiety in elevated plus maze task which was alleviated by cinnamon. HF/HFr diet also resulted in down-regulation of the mRNA encoding glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and GLUT3, and an increase in AD-associated mRNA including phosphatase and tensin homolog (phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)), tau and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the hippocampus and cortex which were alleviated by cinnamon. Peripheral insulin sensitivity was also increased by cinnamon treatment. These finding suggest that cinnamon could improve body insulin sensitivity and related alteration in the brain (50).   Cocos nucifera  L.   Coconut, the drupe of C. nucifera (Arecaceae), has a long history of use as a food, cosmetic agent and medicine. In Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM), It has been considered a medicinal food for preventing and curing many CNS illnesses (10).",1ea20661-e1fd-4f76-946b-3085958bcdbb
18,methods15,"  Brains of ovariectomised rats can display features similar to those observed in menopausal women with AD. Radenahmad et al. investigated the effects of young coconut juice on the pathological alterations occur in the brains of AD ovariectomised rats. Four groups of rats included sham-operated, ovariectomised, ovariectomised +oestradiol benzoate and ovariectomised + coconut juice. Brain sections were immunostained with Aβ1–42, glial fibrillary acidic protein (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)) (an intermediate neurofilament of astrocytes) and Tau-1 antibodies which are reliable biomarkers of amyloidosis, astrogliosis and tauopathy. The results showed that coconut treatment restored the serum oestradiol to levels significantly higher than that of the ovariectomised and sham groups. Aβ deposition and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression was significantly reduced in the cerebral cortex of the coconut-treated animals, as compared with the other groups.",d1127a87-bbc4-46e9-8d0d-2e0cabbe0841
19,methods16," Tau-1 expression was also suppressed in the hippocampus (51).  Coconut oil which is extracted by either hot or cold pressed techniques, contains tocotrienols, squalene, tocopherols and sterols. Coconut oil consists 92 % saturated fatty acid, with 62–70 % being medium-chain triglyceride which can be rapidly metabolized to form ketones or ketone bodies. Ketogenic diets have been found to be effective as a therapy for neurodegeneration (52).  In a clinical trial, De et al. investigated the cognitive impact (orientation, language-building, fixing, calculation-concentration and memory areas) of coconut oil in AD patients through cognitive test Mini-Mental State Examination. For 21 days, half of 44 patients with AD received 40 ml coconut oil daily divided between breakfast (20 ml) and food (20 ml). Cognitive performance in patients who received coconut oil, significantly improved in the orientation and language-construction areas (53).    Corylus avellana  L.    C.",6ce335df-aa5d-4b57-9667-ec046219baff
20,methods17," avellana (Betulaceae) edible nuts commonly known as hazelnut has long been considered a “brain-food”. It is highly prescribed as a neuroprotective and to prevent brain atrophy and memory loss in Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM).   In an experiment, the effect of hazelnut diet [(without skin) 800 mg/kg/day for 1 week] on memory (using Y-maze test and shuttle box apparatus), anxiety (using elevated plus maze task), neuroinflammation and apoptosis was evaluated in Aβ-injected rats. The results showed that hazelnut supplementation improved memory, and reduced anxiety-related behavior. Moreover, Western blot analysis of COX-2, IL-1β, TNF-α, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein, and caspase-3 showed that hazelnut can ameliorate Aβ-induced neuroinflammation and apoptosis (54).   Crocus sativus  L.   Saffron is the stigma from a bulbous plant from Iridaceae which has been widely used as a food spice, coloring and flavoring agent, and medicinal plant in many cultures.",e866a290-fd91-47d8-bc33-7a61acc28652
21,methods18,", saffron consumption as a food and beverage add (55) In Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM), saffron was traditionally used to alleviate several CNS and mental diseases such as AD, depression, anxiety, tension and insomnia and also as a cardioprotective medicine(56, 57).  Papandreou et al. investigated the effects of an aqueous: methanol (50:50, v/v) extract of saffron stigmas on Aβ-aggregation and fibrillogenesis using thioflavine T-based fluorescence assay and by DNA binding shift assay. The results showed that saffron inhibited Aβ fibrillogenesis in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Trans-crocin-4 (6), the digentibiosyl ester of crocetin (7) and the main carotenoid present in saffron, inhibited Aβ fibrillogenesis at lower concentrations than dimethylcrocetin (8), indicating that glycosylated carotenoid is more active (58).",e849f255-1220-4cc2-b937-04ad4e80b30e
22,methods19," The results of 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (acid (ANS))-binding assay showed that crocin, a carotenoid responsible for the color of saffron (59), decreased the hydrophobic area in incubated Aβ42 which is accompanied by a structural change to α-helical and β-turn. This indicates that the anti-amyloidogenic effect of crocin might be due to the inhibition of Aβ formation along with breaking down amyloid aggregates (21). Crocin was capable of decreasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and cleaved caspase-3 level which indicates that crocin inhibits Aβ induced apoptosis possibly by its antioxidant activities (60).  Khalili et al. investigated the effect of crocin (15 and 30 mg/kg, IP, one-day pre-surgery and continued for 3 weeks) on sporadic streptozotocin (streptozotocin (STZ))-induced AD in rats. It was found that crocin at 30 mg/kg exhibited higher correct choices and lower errors in Y-maze test than control rats.",ccfb791f-6c4e-49cb-a53d-da64625dbd1f
23,methods20," Additionally, crocin significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in passive avoidance test (61).  Moreover, crocin and crocetin, were found to provide neuroprotection by inhibiting lpopolysaccharides (lpopolysaccharides (LPS))-induced nitric oxide (NO) release from cultured rat brain microglial cells. These compounds reduced the lpopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced productions of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Crocin and crocetin also effectively reduced lpopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated NF-κB activation. In addition, crocin could reduce NO release from microglia stimulated by interferon-γ (IFNγ) and Aβ. In organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, both compounds inhibited the effect of lpopolysaccharides (LPS) –induced hippocampal cell death (33).",5da754a4-3cee-433a-a034-16ac18cd153b
24,methods21,"  In a 22-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, fifty-four 55 years of age or older patients with mild-to-moderate AD received either ethanol extract of saffron (15 mg twice per day) or donepezil (5 mg twice per day). It was found that saffron was effective similar to donepezil as evidenced by the improvements in both the Alzheimer’s disease assessment scale—cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), and clinical dementia rating scale—sums of boxes (CDR-SB) measures in the saffron group (62).  In another randomized double-blind trial, 68 moderate to severe AD patients (Mini-Mental State Examination score of 8–14) received memantine (20 mg/day) or ethanolic extract of saffron (30 mg/day) for one year. Participants were evaluated every month by severe cognitive impairment rating scale (severe cognitive impairment rating scale (SCIRS)) and functional assessment staging (functional assessment staging (FAST)).",9a63ee7c-4da2-44de-a691-e7574b4b41a3
25,methods22," The results showed that the effect for time × treatment interaction on severe cognitive impairment rating scale (SCIRS) scores for saffron and memantine groups was not significant. During the 12-months period of this trial, saffron- and memantine-treated patients experienced 9.18% and 7.79% decrease in the severe cognitive impairment rating scale (SCIRS) scores, respectively. Moreover, no significant difference between the two groups in the scores changes from baseline to the endpoint on severe cognitive impairment rating scale (SCIRS) and functional assessment staging (FAST) was observed (63).   Cuminum cyminum  Linn.   Dried fruits of C. cyminum commonly known as Cumin seeds are traditionally used as a spice and flavoring agent and a medicine.   Aqueous extract of cumin fruit (50 μg/ml) has been shown to possess AChE inhibitory activity of 76.90±0.003% based on Ellman’s method (64). Koppula et al.",bddca315-ef41-49da-a06a-e67c40410037
26,methods23," reported that oral administration of aqueous extract of cumin (at 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg/day) significantly attenuated scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats using conditioned avoidance response (conditioned avoidance response (CAR)) model by Cook’s pole climbing apparatus. This memory-enhancing activity was determined by improved acquisition, retention, and recovery in extract-treated rats compared to control group. The extract also significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation in both rat liver and brain in comparison with ascorbic acid, a known antioxidant (65).   Oral administration of aqueous extract of cumin (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg) for three weeks significantly improved locomotor and cognitive deficits induced by 1-methyl-4 phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (methyl 4 phenyl 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)) in mice.",63302f7c-9a1f-4125-a925-0675522ed1cc
27,methods24," Cumin also significantly improved methyl 4 phenyl 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced decrease in antioxidant enzyme levels (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase) and inhibited lipid peroxidation in mice brain tissues (66). Cumin essential oil and its n-hexane fraction strongly inhibited α-SN aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. Cuminaldehyde (9), the main component of the cumin oil and its n-hexane fraction, was shown to inhibit the fibrillation process possibly by preventing the elongation stage of the fibrillation. The carboxaldehyde structure of this compound plays important role in its potent activity. Cuminaldehyde has no toxic effects on PC12 cells (67).   Ficus carica  L.   Fig is the edible fruit of F. carica from Moraceae. This well-known Mediterranean fruit has long been used in fresh or dried forms and to prepare preserves and foods.

28,methods25," investigated the effects of a 15 months dietary supplementation of amyloid precursor protein (APP)sw/Tg2576 mice (Tg mice; which show age-related memory and learning impairment as well as Aβ accumulation and serve as a mice model of AD) with pomegranate, figs, or dates on suppressing inflammatory cytokines in brain. It was found that the diet supplements significantly decreased the enhanced levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, TNF-α and eotaxin). In addition, remarkable delays in the formation of senile plaques, as determined by decreasing the levels of brain Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 was observed (68). In another study, the effect of dietary supplementation of Tg mice with 4% figs on the memory, anxiety, and learning skills using the Morris water maze test, rota-rod test, elevated plus maze test, and open-field test was studied.",5c40d322-aa0c-4744-b1cc-ac07210ce209
29,methods26," Tg mice fed a control diet exhibited significant memory deficits, increased anxiety-related behavior, and severe impairment in spatial, position discrimination learning ability, and motor coordination compared to the Tg mice fed 4% fig diet (69). Four% figs fed Tg mice also significantly showed attenuated oxidative damage, as indicated by decreased levels of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls and restoration of antioxidant status. Moreover, deranged activities of membrane bound enzymes (Na+ K+ ATPase and AChE) in Tg mice brain regions was restored by figs treatment (70). In addition, γ-sitosterol (10), a phytosterol found abundantly in fig mesocarp, demonstrated potent reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities (71).    Fish    Lim et al.",beb0ab2d-f8fe-4b1d-a999-4197be07fb56
30,methods27," evaluated the effects of dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA (11); an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)) abundant in fish) on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and amyloid formation in amyloid precursor protein (APP)sw (Tg2576) transgenic mice. It was shown that high-DHA diet could significantly reduce total Aβ by more than 70% when compared with low-DHA or control diets. Moreover, DHA decreased Aβ42 levels compared to the control chow diet. Image analysis of brain sections revealed a 40.3% decrease in overall plaque burden (40-50% reductions in the hippocampus and parietal cortex). DHA also regulated amyloid precursor protein (APP) changes by reducing both α- and β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) C-terminal fragment products and full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) (72). In a clinical study, it was found that consumption of fish once per week or more lowered the risk of AD by 60%. Total intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.",c8b628a2-c2f0-4b88-b5d3-5fbea0b4fd41
31,methods28,"g. DHA) was associated with reduced risk of AD (73). It is evidenced that DHA levels are lower in serum and brains of AD patients, which can be the result of low dietary intake and/or oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (72).   The results of another study revealed that intake of fatty fish, which is a rich source of DHA, more than twice per week was associated with a reduced risk of dementia by 28% (95% CI: 0.51 to 1.02), and AD by 41% (95% CI: 0.36 to 0.95) compared to fish consumption less than once per month especially in people without the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon four allele (74). In the Zutphen Elderly Study, fish consumption was associated with less 5-year subsequent cognitive impairment. Moreover, a linear fashion was observed for the relation between the consumption of (ecosapentaenoic acid) EPA+DHA and cognitive decline. The intake of approximately 380 mg/d of EPA+DHA was associated with a 1.1-point less cognitive decline in elderly men (75).",1e4cedf4-a0b4-4a84-91eb-f4e8008fcd3f
32,methods29,"    Foeniculum vulgare  L.   Fennel seeds (Apiaceae) are commonly used as a spice and flavoring agent in Persian cuisine. It is also used to alleviate a wide spectrum of illnesses especially CNS problems.   Administration of fennel extract (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced the stress-induced urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid in rats. Moreover, fennel dose-dependently improved scopolamine-induced memory deficits in rats. The extract also potently inhibited lipid peroxidation in both rat liver and brain homogenates to a greater extent than the standard antioxidant, ascorbic acid (76).  Administration of methanolic extract of the whole fennel plant (200 mg/kg, p.o.) for 8 days ameliorated scopolamine-induced amnesia and aging-induced memory deficits in mice compared to the control group. In the passive avoidance test, fennel extract could increase step-down latency (step down latency (SDL)).",26b2b295-2f62-404c-a308-68c34b1e2dd6
33,methods30," Moreover, the extract (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, PO) significantly increased acetylcholinesterase inhibition in mice (77). Bhatti et al. investigated the neuroprotective effects of ethanol extract of fennel seeds in a lead-induced neurotoxicity mice model. The results showed that the defected expression levels of oxidative stress markers (SOD1 and peroxiredoxin-6) and the three isoforms of amyloid precursor protein (APP) (amyloid precursor protein (APP) common, 770 and 695), in the cortex and hippocampus were significantly normalized in mice treated by fennel extract (specifically at dose of 200 mg/kg/day). Moreover, the morphological impairments of cortical neurons were significantly ameliorated by fennel extracts (78). Anethole (12), major component of fennel essential oil has been found to possess AChE and BChE inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 39.89 ± 0.32 μg/ml and 75.35 ± 1.47 μg/ml (79).   Honey   Akanmu et al.",5a2e7ac2-92d7-4144-a61f-8dad27012359
34,methods31," evaluated the neuropharmacological effects of three types of Nigerian honeys (10%, 20% and 40% v/v, PO). The results showed that honey significantly decreased locomotion and rearing behaviors in novelty-induced behaviors (novelty induced behaviors (NIB)) and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity tests compared to the control animals which suggests central inhibitory effects (80).   Abdulmajeed et al. investigated the neuroprotective effects of honey against lead-induced neurotoxicity. The results showed that co-administration of honey with lead inhibited neurotoxicity and improved memory function as evidenced by shortened latency period and elongated time spent in target quadrant in honey-fed rats compared to the lead-exposed animals using Morris water maze. In open field test, honey could increase locomotion, exploration and decrease anxiety in lead-exposed animals.",7ad44273-b63f-4018-88a3-2ed400798f93
35,methods32," Honey increased brain SOD, glutathione S-transferases (glutathione S transferases (GST)) and glutathione (glutathione (GSH)) activities but had no significant effect on malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Therefore, neuroprotective effects of honey might be associated with its ability to enhance antioxidant capacity (81).  In another experiment, the effects of Malaysian Tualang honey on hippocampal morphology and memory performance in stressed ovariectomized rats were studied. Tualang honey could improve short-term and long-term memory and enhance the neuronal proliferation in several regions of hippocampus (CA2, CA3 and DG) (82). Honey also restored normal structure of hippocampal cells and prevented loss of neurons in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (83). In another animal cognition experiment (Y maze), honey-fed rats could better recognize the novel arm at 9 and 12 months compared to sugar-free or sucrose-fed animals.",85647c2e-96fd-4e56-9a5f-9f02aac2fb90
36,methods33," This suggest that honey can delay or prevent aging-related memory loss (84).   Juglans regia  L.   Walnut is the edible seed of J. regia from Juglandaceae. Walnut is widely used in Persian cuisine. It is also recommended to prevent and treat memory loss in Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM).   Aqueous tea infusion from flowers and leaves of walnut have been shown to exhibit moderate AChE Inhibitory activity of 45% at 1.36 g/l. Moreover, high antioxidant activity was observed for walnut using DPPH radical scavenging, LDL oxidation, beta-carotene bleaching and Rancimat tests (85).  Neha et al. investigated the inhibitory effect of walnut extract on Aß fibrillization using Thioflavin T fluorescence spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The walnut methanolic extract inhibited Aß fibrillization in a concentration and time- dependent manner (over 90% inhibition with 5 ml of extract). Interestingly, the extract could defibrillize the preformed fibrils of Aβ (91.6% with10 ml of extract).",fd321843-4c64-4d0f-bb12-87e749dfa8ea
37,methods34, These results suggest that walnuts may reduce the risk or delay the onset of AD by maintaining the solubility of Aß (20).

38,discussion0,"Multiple lines of evidence, point out the importance of diet in prevention and improvement of AD (9). According to epidemiological studies, adherence to especial diets can be associated to reduced risk of cognitive impairment, vascular dementia and AD (138). Traditional Persian Medicine as one of the widest practiced medical systems, not only provide with experienced therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AD, but also offers dietary recommendations for prevention and slowing down the progression of the disease. Most of the Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM)-recommended dietary items have been shown to improve memory and cognitive decline and possess anti-amyloidogenic, etc. activities.",29c9d0b9-b60d-45f2-8535-876957d8a86e
39,discussion1," Among them, garlic and its compounds, S-allyl-cysteine and diallyl-disulfide, coconut oil, saffron and its major compounds, crocin and crocetin, honey, fish, lemon balm and its major compound rosmarinic acid, raisin and resveratrol, rose flowers and geraniol, ginger and its 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol, cumin and its main component cuminaldehyde have been found to possess stronger anti-AD activities. Most of these food items and compounds exhibited remarkable antioxidant and AChE inhibitory activities and decreased oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation level (134).",bef73120-6baf-453c-84c5-a06860606c86
40,discussion2," In animal AD models, they showed anti-amyloidogenic effects, reduced cerebral plaques and soluble and fibrillar Aβ-species, suppressed cerebral inflammation and alterations in tau protein and inhibited Aβ-induced apoptosis through various mechanisms including elevating samyloid precursor protein (APP)a levels, decreasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and cleaved caspase-3 level, decreasing in Aβ40 and Aβ42, reducing NO release from microglia, activation of SIRT1 and activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways, etc. (33, 37, 60). The Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM)-recommended foods also increased neuronal density and total volume of hippocampus (126, 134) and improved the cognitive and behavioral impairment and AD-like pathology in animal experiments (35). Notably, anti-AD effects of a number of Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM)-recommended food items including ginger, saffron, fish, coconut oil and lemon balm have been supported by epidemiological studies.",21f4851b-a66c-4cda-b257-5eb4b2582980
41,discussion3,"   Mediterranean diet as one of the most distinguished healthy diets is characterized by high intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals, nuts, fish and olive oil (containing polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)), but low intake of saturated fatty acids, dairy products, meat and poultry (139). There is a large volume of evidence supporting an association between the adherence to MD and slower rates of cognitive decline, improvements in cognitive performance and reduced incidence of AD (139, 140). Interestingly, there are close similarities between Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) anti-AD diet and the typical MD. For instance, vegetables like garlic, lemon balm and fenugreek; honey, fish, spices like saffron, cumin, mustard and fennel; legumes especially chickpea; nuts especially walnuts, almond and pistachio are highly consumed in both diets.",cd9fbf83-6951-4184-94c8-3fa903d3c704
42,discussion4,"   The use of egg, fish eggs, gout and cow milk, bird’s meat and brain and especial food items including Pistacia atlantica, Pistacia gerardiana, ‘reshteh’ (Persian whole wheat noodles) and barley soup has been recommended by Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) as dietary items to prevent AD or to be included in AD patient’s diet (11, 12, 15). Pharmacological and clinical evidence supporting anti-AD effects of these items and a number of other Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM)-foods are rare. Therefore, future animal and human studies evaluating their potential effects in prevention and alleviation of AD are needed.   Interestingly, excessive consumption of some vegetables and foodstuffs such as onion (Allium cepa), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), broad bean (Vicia faba), (15) have been ruled out from anti-AD Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) diet.",9dea844a-1499-4a2d-af89-e8ff5dea3da3
43,discussion5," It is necessary to mention that a number of the most potent anti-Alzheimer food items including garlic, walnut and mustard have been considered harmful by Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) in some other CNS disorders such as epilepsy and vertigo due to their effects on the raise of detrimental, pro-epileptic humors into the brain. (27). However, no pharmacological data supporting this effect exist which necessitates conducting additional studies devoted to epileptonic properties of these plants. Moreover, a number of activities including excessive sexual activity, exercise or heavy physical activity after meals, drinking iced water, etc. are considered to trigger AD. Therefore, considering these recommendations in AD patients’ lifestyle and studying their impact would be of value to expand our current knowledge on etiology and treatment of AD.",749284db-7ab4-44f7-95b1-ce21514e26b3
44,discussion6,"  Conclusion Given the important role of different traditional medicine systems in discovering new therapeutic strategies, medicines and nutraceuticals for curing ailments, considering Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) anti-AD dietary recommendations in future research would be helpful. Moreover, further research on molecular and cellular mechanisms of actions, clinical effects, adverse reactions, optimum doses and pharmacokinetic profile of the discussed food items and their bioactive compounds, can pave the way to more effective new anti-AD product development.
