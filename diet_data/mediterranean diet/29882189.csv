0,introduction0,"Depression is a severe mental disorder predicted to be the second leading cause of disability globally by 2020 (Global Burden of Disease study 2013 collaborators, 2015). Like other mental disorders, it has multi-causal pathogenesis including genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors.  Evidence has accumulated to suggest that diet plays a role in the onset of depression, resulting in increased interest in the potential of dietary approaches for the prevention and treatment of depression . Hypothesised mechanisms for the action of diet include direct influence of nutrients on brain metabolism, inflammation and oxidative stress . Several nutrients including essential fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid), vitamins B12, B6, folate and vitamin D, magnesium, selenium and zinc (Almeida et al., 2015; Mocking et al., 2016; Appleton et al., 2017; Schefft et al.",cab09c54-fe65-4373-8695-1905970acd32
1,introduction1,", 2017) have been investigated in relation to depression; however, the findings are mixed . The challenge of separating the different nutrient-health associations in observational studies is acknowledged. Thus dietary patterns may be more informative for investigating diet–disease relationships as they capture the synergistic and correlated effects of separate nutrients and foods (Ocké, 2013).  Existing systematic reviews of surveys and cohort studies provide inconclusive evidence that healthy dietary patterns, consisting of high intakes of vegetables, fruit, fish, healthy oils and low intakes of red and processed meat are protective for development of depressive symptoms (Quirk et al., 2013; Lai et al., 2014; Rahe et al., 2014; Khalid et al., 2016; Lassale et al., 2018; Molendijk et al., 2018).",17cda705-0e19-4639-8884-02a7cf6ce817
2,introduction2," The conflicting results to date may be due to differences in study design, including choice of instrument utilised to measure depressive symptoms and approach to adjustment for potential confounders. Further, the identification of food groups is unstandardised across studies, e.g. low and high-fat dairy intakes may be combined, and dietary patterns may be operationalised in different ways, using a priori or a posteriori methods. Such methodological issues have implications for the apparent effects of ‘healthy diets’, as variously defined. Three previous meta-analyses of observational studies (Quirk et al., 2013; Lassale et al., 2018; Molendijk et al., 2018) found inconsistencies in the associations observed, with moderate to high levels of heterogeneity.  We aimed to clarify the potential of healthy diets in the prevention of depression using data from observational studies.",ffd90c4d-eb1e-4365-8b2b-91893a213764

Study protocol We developed a standardised protocol to define the analytic sample, create the determinant and outcome variables, select confounders and perform statistical analyses. The protocol was shared with consortium members and approved prior to starting the analyses.

The choice of cohort phase to be included in this analysis was based on whether diet and depressive symptoms were included in what was considered to be the ‘baseline’; similar follow-up time; and if possible, comparable age range of participants.  Measures of depressive symptoms Four cohorts measured depressive symptoms using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD)) scale: Whitehall II, Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) and InCHIANTI used Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD)-20 and Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) used Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD)-10 (Radloff, 1977).",ba9d79ba-7e7b-46d9-840d-95a1e817e995
8,methods4," In Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) depressive symptoms were assessed with the 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report (IDS)) . Healthy Life in an Urban Setting (HELIUS) measured depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) . Anti-depressive medication was self-reported, except in Healthy Life in an Urban Setting (HELIUS) where research staff noted medication as brought in by participants. Definitions used in the current study: 1. ‘Depressive symptoms’ – continuous variable based on the number of depressive symptoms.  2. ‘High depressive symptoms’ – dichotomous variable based on validated cohort-specific cut-offs. CES-D cut-off of ⩾20 was applied by InCHIANTI (Fava, 1983); CES-D ⩾16 was used by Whitehall II and Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) (Radloff, 1977; Beekman et al.",b0ac7738-e583-4c18-8c5f-71cff231fc27

We selected three a priori defined dietary patterns that are commonly used in studies of diet and depression: • Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)) based on Panagiotakos et al. (2007).  • Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010) based on Chiuve et al. (2012).  • Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) based on Fung et al. (2008).    See online Supplementary file 1, Table S2 for a description of dietary patterns.",8dc9e97e-748c-40de-8386-5323f28b4ba4
11,methods7,"  Exclusions In the cohorts including older persons (Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), Whitehall II and InCHIANTI) we excluded participants with cognitive impairment based on the Mini Mental State Examination score <24 as this may have caused an unreliable dietary intake assessment (Tombaugh and McIntyre, 1992). We also excluded participants with improbable energy intakes based on Willett's cut-offs (women: <500 kcal, >3500 kcal and men: <800 kcal, >4000 kcal) (Willett, 2013).  Confounders Confounders were selected based on the literature and included age, sex and ethnicity (measured in Healthy Life in an Urban Setting (HELIUS) and Whitehall II), education level (highest completed educational level in three categories, based on cohort-specific measures), marital status (married/living with partner, never married, divorced/widowed), employment situation [in paid employment, not working (home-maker, retired), unemployed or unable to work (sickness benefit)], smoking (current,",d53198dd-86ed-4c06-ab09-32c23e503d8a

Analysis at the individual study level All variables (confounder, dietary and depression variables), including categorical variables, were standardised for the statistical analysis. Models were built stepwise to allow evaluation of the biasing effect of confounders. Model zero included age, sex, ethnicity and educational level. Model one added marital status and employment situation. Model two added lifestyle factors: smoking, physical activity, energy intake. Model three additionally accounted for chronic disease. Finally, model four added BMI, online Supplement 2 presents the results of all analyses.",f25e9929-ab1b-4d91-9445-9f1a56a77aea
13,methods9,"  Cross-sectional analysis The association of dietary patterns with the transformed, standardised continuous ‘depressive symptoms’ score was modelled using linear regression. We chose to transform the depressive symptoms score for analysis as its association with the dietary patterns did not produce normally distributed residuals. The association of dietary pattern and the dichotomous variables ‘high depressive symptoms’ and ‘high depressive symptoms e/o meds’ was analysed using logistic regression.  Prospective analysis followed the same approach and considered the association of dietary pattern at baseline with depressive symptoms at follow-up. In regression analysis, we corrected for continuous depressive symptoms score at baseline, in logistic regression we excluded those with high depressive symptoms at baseline.",40c1d209-8adb-4836-bb0d-8d138851d201
14,methods10," We tested for interaction with age, sex (in all studies) and ethnicity (in the Whitehall II and Healthy Life in an Urban Setting (HELIUS) studies only as the other cohorts did not include sufficient numbers of different ethnic groups to allow these analyses). There was no consistent pattern of interaction, so final analyses do not include interaction terms. To illustrate, in Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) there was statistically significant interaction with sex in the association between AHEI-2010 and continuous depressive symptoms, in Whitehall interaction with sex was observed in for the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) only, while in other cohorts we observed no interactions with sex.  Sensitivity analyses The continuous ‘depressive symptoms score’ was not normally distributed in most cases so we transformed the standardised depression score (using an LN + 1 transformation).",5df0bf41-6427-4c76-ba36-4408a7dfd29d
15,methods11," However, the transformation applied was not successful in normalising the depression scores in all cohorts so in sensitivity analyses we studied the diet–depression relationship using partial Spearman's correlations. We also ran the analyses with the addition of WC instead of BMI to model four as this measure is sometimes considered a better proxy for body fat levels.  Meta-analysis A random-effects approach was considered to be the best option to analyse regression coefficients and ORs because data were derived from observational studies with different recruitment and examination protocols and population characteristics. lnORs were obtained by the logistic regression coefficients and standard errors approximated by delta-method (Casella and Berger, 2002). The inverse-variance method was applied to give preferences to large samples and Restricted Maximum Likelihood Method was applied to estimate the between-study variance (Peace and Chen, 2013).",a289a092-3749-4ef4-84f1-931f3bedd54b

We observed an inverse association between three different a priori defined dietary patterns and depressive symptoms in cross-sectional as well as prospective analyses over a time frame of 5–6 years.  A recent meta-analysis observed that healthy dietary patterns, operationalised using a priori and a posteriori approaches, were prospectively associated with lower depressive symptoms .

28,discussion2, Heterogeneity was lower in cross-sectional analysis where we included the use of anti-depressive medication in defining high depressive symptoms implying that differences in depressive symptom measures between studies may account for the differences observed. Removal of individual studies from meta-analyses revealed that no single study was consistently responsible for heterogeneity.  A recent review observed that adherence to healthy dietary patterns was not associated with depression in studies that controlled for depressive symptoms at baseline . We corrected for baseline depressive symptoms in prospective analyses of the continuous outcome measure and excluded participants with ‘high depressive symptoms’ at baseline in the analysis of the dichotomous outcome at follow-up. In both approaches we found an inverse association between dietary pattern scores and depressive symptoms.,920006f4-e10a-42bb-af4f-f1b33605dc78
29,discussion3," Our standardised approach may explain the difference with previous findings .  Associations between the three dietary patterns in this study and depressive symptoms were consistent implying that all ‘healthy’ dietary patterns may contribute to the prevention of depressive symptoms. Estimates were derived from standardised confounders and standardised outcomes meaning we can compare the coefficients from each dietary pattern because they are expressed on the same scale. Findings for the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) could be considered most consistent in that the heterogeneity was zero in most of the analyses. However, differences in effect size between the dietary patterns were quite minimal.",bb0818a5-ae50-446b-af9c-836d72722eb6

Furthermore, the scoring of the dietary patterns used our analysis differs somewhat, the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and AHEI-2010 assign points according to the absolute amount that is consumed whereas the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores are based on relative intakes, i.e. population quintiles. This is reflected in the low correlation between the dietary pattern scores within cohorts. Nonetheless, the patterns all score recognised elements of a healthy diet positively: fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes; and red and processed meats negatively.",5d7912c5-3199-45c5-9ce4-47abca7b23e0
31,discussion5,"  Strengths and limitations The main strength of this study was the use of a standardised protocol that specified the adjustment for a large number of potential confounders, including chronic diseases and body weight. Included were three commonly applied dietary pattern scores to facilitate the comparability of the findings with the existing literature on diet and depression. It is, however, possible that the included dietary patterns do not represent the most optimal mix of foods for the prevention of depression. We specified the step-wise inclusion of potential confounders to examine their potential effect. Models were corrected for total energy intake, the presence of chronic disease and BMI, factors which could also potentially mediate the association between dietary patterns and depression, so it could be argued that there is potential for overcorrection. Indeed the largest change in estimates was observed in the models before and after correction for energy intake.",60110c60-010e-4982-9577-f795d652a879
32,discussion6," For example, the association between the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and continuous depressive symptoms in the InCHIANTI study was −0.04 (model 1) and became smaller with adjustment for lifestyle factors and energy intake: −0.03 (model 2). However, correcting for both energy intake and BMI is common practice in nutritional epidemiology as a way of reducing the influence of residual variation in the regression analysis . In subsequent models we observed minimal changes in the association with the addition of confounders; the change in estimate in most cases was lower than 10% (see online Supplementary file 2, Table 6 for an overview of the change in estimate with adjustment). This implies that the association between dietary patterns and depressive symptoms observed in this study is rather robust.",75f1a0ee-6d39-4fb4-9edf-a616e4d9d9ed
33,discussion7,"  A limitation is that we were only able to include three prospective cohorts, although together, these studies represent more than 11 000 individuals with widely differing characteristics. Secondly, depressive symptoms measured on a continuous scale were not normally distributed with many zero values. We log-transformed the outcome variable to compensate for lack of normal distribution and also ran the analyses using Spearman's partial correlations instead of regression analysis and found similar outcomes (results not shown). The presence of zero values cannot be solved either by transformation or non-parametric correlations but is somewhat compensated by dichotomising the outcome variable. In both approaches results were in line with each other. Thirdly, we did not study the effect of obesity but included BMI as a continuous variable in the analyses. Adding BMI did not have a large effect on the regression coefficients.",e3bb9b14-30f3-4ec1-9205-57434bb0daa8
34,discussion8," For example, in Healthy Life in an Urban Setting (HELIUS) the association between the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and ‘high depression e/o meds’ was 0.827 (s.e. 0.039) in model 3 and 0.831 (s.e. 0.039) when BMI was included (online Supplementary file 2, Table S3). In sensitivity analyses with WC instead of BMI differences in effect size were small. In Healthy Life in an Urban Setting (HELIUS), adjusting for WC instead of BMI in the aforementioned example resulted in an OR of 0.830 (s.e. 0.039). Fourthly, the depression scales used in this study do differ from each other and as most cohorts did not have clinical diagnoses of depression we focused on symptom scores, which is a common approach in population/cohort studies. The variation in depression measures used by each cohort is the reason we chose to standardise the outcome ‘depressive symptoms’ for the linear regression, and to perform a harmonised meta-analysis instead of an individual participant meta-analysis.",305a3528-c47a-4e6c-acc3-845744cbaba9
35,discussion9,"  Finally, given that mental health outcomes are often clustered within individuals it is conceivable that healthy dietary patterns are also beneficial for other outcomes. For example, a study within the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) cohort examined depressive and anxiety disorders and found the comorbidity between these disorders to be ~67%, within this cohort it was observed that the associations with food groups were generally present for both depression and anxiety patients (Gibson-smith et al., 2019). Unfortunately, we could only study depression outcomes in this analysis because most of the cohorts did not include other mental health conditions.  Implications of findings The results of this study need to be confirmed by trials conducted in the general population as it is not possible to address causality using observational data.",b4110cc3-66f9-444a-9ce8-7e0c4c128e26
36,discussion10," Nonetheless, an inverse association between dietary patterns and depressive symptoms was observed in both cross-sectional and prospective studies with little influence from a range of relevant confounders. There were considerable differences between cohorts, for example, In-Chianti consisted of older adults living in a specific rural region while the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) study consisted of middle-aged women sampled from across Australia and Healthy Life in an Urban Setting (HELIUS) of a multi-ethnic population in one city. Nonetheless, associations were consistent across the studies included. The association is biologically plausible based on a number of hypothesised mechanisms in which dietary components play a role . Finally, the findings of two recent trials that a healthy (Mediterranean) dietary pattern may be useful as an adjunct treatment for patients with depression (Jacka et al., 2017; Parletta et al.",f6e5d20c-07b5-418d-a003-75e825d020c2
37,discussion11,", 2017) lends credence to the idea that a healthy diet may impact the development of depressive symptoms.  Our findings imply that public health messages to promote healthy dietary patterns high in fruit, vegetables, whole grains and low in red and processed meat could contribute to the prevention of depression in addition to other chronic diseases. Although effect sizes were small, the findings were robust implying that healthy dietary patterns could have a significant effect at the population level.  Conclusion Based on the findings from this harmonised meta-analysis of observational studies, we conclude that greater adherence to a healthy dietary pattern is associated with fewer depressive symptoms and a lower risk of developing depressive symptoms over time. Promotion of a healthy diet, compatible with national dietary guidelines that are developed to prevent chronic diseases, may have additional benefits for mental health.",4c49c11d-eb45-467c-8c23-35d3382542d0
