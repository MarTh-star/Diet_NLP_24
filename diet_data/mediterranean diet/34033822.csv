0,methods0," This monocentric study was carried out in patients attending the Obesity Unit (C.I.B.O. and EASO center) at the Unit of Endocrinology, Clinical Medicine and Surgery Department, University “Federico II” of Naples from January 2015 to January 2021. Federico II Ethical Committee approved this study protocol (n. 239/11). This study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association) for experiments that involved humans. Part of the participants were also recruited during the OPERA prevention project for details see “The opera prevention project” (35). All participants were informed about the study design and aim and gave informed consent. This study included 794 participants, coming from the same geographical area around Naples metropolitan area, Campania, Italy.  Thyroid Assessments  In all participants, thyroid nodular disease was evaluated at the Endocrinology Unit of Federico II Hospital (Naples, Italy).",718d6169-a7ea-402b-9d09-4c361359504d
1,methods1," In the subset of the study participants with thyroid nodular disease, the cytological samples obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA), have been analyzed of the Pathology Department, according to the Italian consensus for the classification and reporting of thyroid cytology (36). Based on this classification, patients were divided into 5 categories: TIR2, non-malignant/benign; TIR3a, low-risk indeterminate lesion; TIR3b, high-risk indeterminate lesion; TIR4, suspicious of malignancy, and TIR5, malignant. In particular, in this study we grouped the patients into two different risk categories, low risk or uncertain risk of malignancy (TIR2, TIR3a, and TIR3b) and high risk of malignancy (TIR4/TIR5). Thyroid nodular disease with TIR1 cytology were excluded from this study.",2e391934-44a3-410d-8cd3-c82130ca99b3
2,methods2,"  Physical Activity and Smoking Habits  Physical activity levels and smoking habits were evaluated in all participants through the administration of a standard questionnaire, as already reported in other studies (37, 38). Subjects who practiced at least 30 min of daily aerobic physical activity were classified as active (YES). Similarly, when participants smoking at least one cigarette per day were classified as current smokers (YES), as we reported earlier (39, 40).  Anthropometric Measurements  All anthropometric measurements, including weight and height were done after an overnight fast, between 9 and 10 a.m. in all participants who wore light clothing and were without shoes. In particular, a wall-mounted stadiometer to the nearest 1 cm and a calibrated balance beam scale was used to the nearest 50 g (Seca 711; Seca, Hamburg, Germany) were used for height and weight measurement, respectively.",c815fd2b-800c-450d-bf5e-823ee83370e8
3,methods3," Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated by weight (kg) and height squared (m2) and subjects were classified into five Body mass index (BMI) classes: normal weight, overweight, grade I obesity, grade II obesity, and grade III obesity (Body mass index (BMI): 18.5–24.9, 25.0–29.9, 30.0–34.9, 35.0–39.9, and ≥40.0 kg/m2, respectively), as previously reported (41) and in accordance with the WHO's criteria WHO (42).  Adherence to the MD  A previously validated of 14-item questionnaire PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED)) (43) questionnaire, was assessed for evaluated adherence to the MD (43), as we reported earlier (44–46). This questionnaire was performed by a certified clinical nutritionist through a face-to-face interview with all the enrolled participants. Scores of zero (No) and one (Yes), were given for questions of PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire.",444f2a38-5aa1-469f-b7f1-c95f4780c3a3
4,methods4," From the sum of the 14 questions of the PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire, PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score was calculated. From the totalized PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score values, participants we divided into three categories of adherence to the MD: highest adherence, average adherence, and lowest adherence to the MD (PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score ≥10, 6–9, and 0–5, respectively) (44–46).  Statistical Analysis  Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to evaluate the data distribution and the abnormal data were normalized by logarithm. Skewed variables were back-transformed for presentation in tables and figures. The chi-square (χ2) test was used to determine the statistically significant differences in the frequency distribution, including sex, lifestyle characteristics, anthropometric measurements, nutritional and thyroid parameters.",ff96760f-1a48-49f5-82d0-df22ef0c5d0b
5,methods5," The differences in continuous variables between nodules presence/absence were compared using the Student's unpaired t-test, while the differences in multiple groups (cytology categories based on 2013 Italian thyroid cytology classification system) were analyzed by ANOVA test followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test. A multinomial logistic regression model, odds ratio (OR), p-value, 95% interval confidence (IC), R2, and χ2, were performed to assess the association among nodules presence/absence and cytology categories (TIR2, TIR3a, TIR3b vs. TIR4, and TIR5) with categorical variables included in this study.

As novel finding, we reported that adherence to the MD was reduced in patients with thyroid nodular disease and in particular in those with cytological category with high-risk of malignancy, independently of Body mass index (BMI).  Thyroid Nodular Disease and Mediterranean Diet  A PREDMED score ≤ 5 was reported in more than 50% of patients with thyroid nodules vs. 16% of those without thyroid nodules. Analyzing the single items of the PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire, it was evident that the consumption of almost all the Mediterranean healthy foods was lower in patients with thyroid nodules. At multiple regression analysis, the low consumption of fish and fruits, and the high consumption of red meats were associated with the presence of thyroid nodules.",033130d2-bac4-4170-9356-b27958cdc87c
25,discussion1," At regression analysis, the low adherence to the MD entered before than Body mass index (BMI) as the best predictor of the presence of thyroid nodules. In the context of the accurate clinical evaluation of thyroid nodular disease, the PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score ≤ 5 could be served as an adjunctive predictor for helping in characterizing patients with presence of thyroid nodules.  Previous studies have mainly focused on the correlation between adherence to the MD and reduced risk of several cancer types and mortality (47). In addition, several studies have been carried out on the intake of single nutrients and foods and the risk of thyroid cancer, summarized in a recent narrative review (1). In particular, evidence reported that many foods typical of the MD, including fish and iodine-rich foods, fruits and vegetables, might exert protective effects on the reduction of thyroid cancer risk.",6a9c2eff-f0a1-40aa-8275-a35ec5f7f8a7
26,discussion2," Conversely, alcohol intake (48, 49) and red meat consumption (50) exert negative effects on thyroid cancer risk. Indeed, it is well-known that an approach based on studying a single food does not take into account the synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions existing among nutrients and foods, and it probably has a suboptimal statistical power to assess associations with the risk of cancer (51). Yet, no study to date has attempted to investigate the association of adherence to the MD or single foods of MD and thyroid nodular disease.  Previous evidence investigated the association between obesity and thyroid nodular disease, indicating that patients with obesity were more likely to have thyroid nodules disease compared to normal weight individuals (6, 52).",d8c69fed-eb82-4fea-93f8-691bd39d9db0
27,discussion3," In particular, obesity has been linked to higher serum thyroid stimulating hormone (thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)) concentrations (53, 54), which consequently leads to higher thyroid volume (55) being the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) a stimulating factor potentially contributing to the development of thyroid nodular disease and thyroid cancer (56).  Of interest, as found by Panagiotou et al. the nodule size was associated also with body fat percentage (57). In our study, we did not measure body composition; nevertheless, we found that patients with obesity had a higher prevalence of thyroid nodules compared with normal weight individuals. Studies showed that hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes conditions that often coexist in patients with obesity, and represent risk factors for thyroid cancer independent of obesity.",17accb16-e4c6-4267-93c7-2d468245fd4a
28,discussion4," The proposal mechanism for this association was the activation of insulin and insulin-like growth factor pathway, which share affinity with insulin receptor and that could be over activated by compensatory hyperinsulinemia to insulin resistance (58). In addition, considering that the body size affects the iodine requirements, obesity is also considered one condition of relative iodine deficiency, which could predispose to thyroid nodular disease (59).  Thyroid Nodule Cytology and Mediterranean Diet  The management of thyroid nodular disease is primarily based on morphologic classification of cytological samples obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA), complemented by clinical history of the nodule, imaging findings, and molecular markers test results (60). Nevertheless, ~25% of all fine needle aspiration (FNA)s falls into the indeterminate category, possibly resulting in unnecessary thyroid surgery (61).",a8ba0b66-cd46-4e11-bee9-e318352b3e01
29,discussion5," To increase the characterization of the cytological category with high-risk of malignancy by including the evaluation of modifiable risk factors, such as unhealthy foods and dietary patterns, could add an additional criterion to help the clinicians in the management of thyroid nodular disease. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the association between adherence to the MD according to the cytological classification of thyroid nodular disease in the subset of the study participants who have undergone fine needle aspiration (FNA).  According to the five diagnostic cytology categories based on 2013 Italian thyroid cytology classification system, more than 18% of the study participants presented TIR2, while ~9 and 8% of the participants had high-risk categories, TIR4 and TIR5, respectively. The high-risk category (TIR4/TIR5) increased along the Body mass index (BMI) categories. In particular, in class II obesity 54.9% of patients had high-risk categories (TIR4 28.",f5648fd0-21dd-40db-b269-00de7000ac44
30,discussion6,"2% and TIR5 26.7%), while 7.6% had TIR2; in class III obesity 78.3% of patients had high-risk categories (TIR4 36.6% and TIR5 41.7%), while 4.8% had TIR2. Consistently, the high-risk categories increased along with the reduction to adherence to the MD. In particular, up to 98% of patients with TIR5 had a low adherence to the MD.  Analyzing the single items of the PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire in relation with cytological categories, the consumption of almost all Mediterranean healthy foods was lower in patients with the high-risk category compared to patients with the low-risk category of malignancy. In particular, the low consumption of extra virgin olive oil, and the high consumption of red meats were associated with the high-risk category of malignancy.",0b2d1d76-2eec-43f0-91e0-139a49a16c85
31,discussion7," In addition, considering lifestyles (smoking and physical activity), Body mass index (BMI), and score of adherence to the MD, at multiple regression analysis, the PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score entered before smoking and Body mass index (BMI) as predictor of high-risk category and a PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score ≤ 4 could help to characterize patients with high-risk category of malignancy.  Earlier evidence has mainly evaluated the association between single foods and differentiated thyroid cancer, nevertheless only few researches have been carried out studies to investigate the relationship between differentiated thyroid cancer and dietary patterns (21, 62–64).  In a case control study Sangsefidi et al.",2c8c182a-fc68-4a08-81d5-8c81b4445bf4
32,discussion8," conducted among 309 individuals in northeast of Iran, authors investigated the association among four major dietary patterns including traditional dietary pattern, western dietary pattern, transitional dietary pattern, and healthy dietary pattern with the risk of having or developing thyroid cancer (64). The study results showed that only Western diet, characterized by high consumption of meat, eggs, refined cereals, cakes, sweet drinks, and alcohol intake, was associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer (64).  In contrast with results of Sangsefidi et al. (64) and Clero et al. (62) conducted in French Polynesia a case-control study in 229 cases of thyroid cancer and 371 controls, evaluating two different dietary patterns: Western diet and traditional Polynesian dietary pattern. The traditional Polynesian diet included specific foods of Pacific islands, including taro, cassava, tubers, sweet potato, fish and seafood, and fruits (as banana, mango, and pawpaw).",a229140d-c650-47a0-b839-a5280e3e26d5
33,discussion9," Authors concluded that in French Polynesia there was no association between a Western diet and the risk of thyroid cancer. Conversely, the traditional Polynesian diet led to a weak reduced risk of thyroid cancer (62).  Results similar to ours were reported by Markaki et al. in a Greek population (63). This case-control study has been conducted in 113 patients with histologically verified thyroid cancer and 138 healthy controls, age, and sex-matched. The study results showed that dietary patterns characterized by the high consumption of fish, vegetables and fruits, led to a reduced risk for all thyroid cancers. In particular, high fish and vegetable intakes led to an increased risk of follicular thyroid cancer (63).  Moreover, in another study Liang J et al. in a case-control study of 390 historically confirmed incident thyroid cancer cases and 436 population controls conducted in Connecticut (2010–2011), examined the association between thyroid cancer risk and dietary pattern (21).",9413aa9b-f92f-49fd-8c9d-c02721a30211
34,discussion10," The dietary patterns analyzed in this study were three: high protein and fat, starchy foods and desserts, and fruits and vegetables. The results of this study showed that the fruits and vegetables dietary pattern was significantly correlated with a reduced risk of overall thyroid cancer. Contrariwise, the starchy foods and desserts dietary pattern was positively associated with an overall thyroid cancer risk among men (21).  All the above-mentioned studies supported the link between specific foods characteristic of the MD and reduced thyroid cancer risk, although the exact mechanisms through which MD might affect thyroid cancer risk are still unclear. In particular, the low adherence to the MD is characterized by high consumption of red meat and low consumption of fish.",68ef9795-d7e9-4c71-8ea0-be522ca7539a
35,discussion11," Evidence indicated that processing of red meat or its cooking at a high temperature, is associated with the production of carcinogenic compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, and N-nitroso compounds. These compounds via increasing the proliferation of cells can promote carcinogenesis and result in increasing of overall cancer risk (65, 66). In this context, in 2002 Memon et al. showed a positive association between the high consumptions of mutton and lamb with thyroid cancer (67). Two very recent review summarized the role of individual foods on thyroid cancer risk concluding that to date, no definite association among dietary patterns, including MD and thyroid cancer, and its clinical severity and aggressiveness have been found (1, 68). Albeit the association between single foods and thyroid cancer is difficult to examine, the high consumption of vegetables, fruits, and fish foods, might exert protective effects on thyroid cancer risk.",2bc47423-d347-42e7-8748-6094e9bbe594
36,discussion12," These foods, for the presence of essential nutrients including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins (retinol, vitamin D, and vitamin E), and minerals, have an anti-inflammatory properties and have been reported to be a protective factor in some types of tumors, including breast cancer (69, 70), neuroendocrine tumors (71, 72), and thyroid cancer (50, 73, 74).  Despite the attention that has been paid to the relation between diet and thyroid cancer risk, it is tempting to speculate that the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of MD could be extended to the complex pathogenesis of thyroid nodular disease. However, although it has been reported that different foods and vitamins supplementation were differently associated with benign breast disease and diet, the relationship between adherence to the MD and thyroid nodular disease is an unexplored field, and associative clinical studies are still lacking (75).",986ae0a0-eff3-439b-b614-2922ce27bc3a
37,discussion13," In particular, to the best of our knowledge the association between adherence to the MD and the cytological classification of thyroid nodular disease has not investigated previously.  Several studies supported the link between the low adherence to the MD and inflammation (31, 76). Indeed, cytokines, activating molecules in chronic inflammation, has been reported to facilitate the prevalence of thyroid nodular disease directly causing thyroiditis, playing a critical role in widely regulating cellular functions and promoting cellular proliferation, hyperplasia, differentiation, and survival (11). In this context, a recent study has been reported that the inflammation promotes the development of thyroid nodular disease, probably due to its indirect effect through inhibiting the synthesis of thyroid hormones, which results in the elevation of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (11).",aaa97768-1e60-4daf-9360-1254aec3c464
38,discussion14," Furthermore, chronic inflammation is also associated with the malignant growth in thyroid nodular disease (77). In particular, the elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels was implied of the development of thyroid nodular disease through the growth and proliferation of thyroid cell in different ways, thus leading to the formation to the goiter and thyroid nodular disease (11, 78). These results suggest that chronic inflammation, which coexists with the elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, in involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid nodular disease (11).  Limitations  Despite these novel results, we are aware that our study presented several limitations. First, the observational design of this study does not allow any causal interpretation of the findings.",0b693558-476e-4b5a-9a5c-b49cbf513772
39,discussion15," In fact, the main limitation of this study is represented by the by the cross-sectional experimental design, which, although showing the association of the adherence to the MD with thyroid nodular disease and thyroid cancer malignancy, fails to provide any explanation of the causality of this association. Further, the study participants were not investigated by a medical history, including familiarity for thyroid nodular disease, exposure to radiation, and iodine intake. Second, data on thyroid function and additional ultrasound characteristics of thyroid nodular disease are lacking. Indeed, the relationship between adherence to the MD and thyroid function has been previously investigated in a cohort of subjects with overweight and obesity (79).",931d4f6d-9e5e-4907-a51d-2413a666abb0
40,discussion16," In this cohort study, the Authors demonstrated that the higher adherence to the MD was independently associated to a slightly reduced thyroid function, and attributed this due to increase in the tissue and organ sensitivity to thyroid hormones and the reduction of thyroid hormones could be associated with the reduced formation of thyroid nodular disease (79). Third, we did not analyse inflammatory markers. Nevertheless, on the one side the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of the MD is well-known (31, 80); on the other side it has reported that chronic inflammation promotes the development of thyroid nodular disease, probably due to its indirect effect via inhibiting the synthesis of thyroid hormone, which results in the elevation of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (11). A further important limitation in this study is that cytological data were not confirmed by histopathology.",fb6a6f6e-6c06-49b4-98ba-f5ef10fd564d
41,discussion17," Finally, the proposed cut-off points of PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score for helping in characterizing patients with presence of thyroid nodules and cytological categories with high risk of malignancy (TIR4 and TIR5) should be validated in different population samples by further clinical trials.  Strengths  This study has several strengths. The single-center study design of this research, although it could represent a selection bias due to the limits the generalizability of our findings, allowed us to increase the homogeneity of the sample. In particular, all participants included were came from the same geographical area, thus possibly sharing overall similar food availability. Moreover, we adjusted our data for a wide range of confounding factors that might have influence on thyroid nodular disease and thyroid cancer, including sex, age, physical activity, smoking, and Body mass index (BMI).",a3a48cf5-b47d-4bc7-8bd5-0149c8c83aff
42,discussion18," The questionnaire of adherence to the MD used in this study, PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire was recently validated in different Mediterranean countries, including Italy (81). This questionnaire was not self-reported, but face-to-face administered by a certified Nutritionist, to reduce any bias related to the filling in of this questionnaire. Furthermore, the results of nutritional research using overall dietary patterns, such as MD compared to the study of the single food or nutrient is more amenable to translation into clinical practice (51, 82).  Conclusions  Thyroid nodular disease is common in general population. To the best of our knowledge, no study to date that reported the association of adherence to the MD with thyroid nodular disease and cytological category with high-risk of malignancy were carried out.",aedf25fb-aace-42f7-bd85-a7a4865d591c
43,discussion19," Even if the mechanisms underlying these observed associations remain largely speculative, the evaluation of adherence to the MD could represent an adjunctive tool in helping clinicians to better characterize patients with thyroid nodular disease and with cytological category with high-risk of malignancy. In this context, there is a strong rationale to support the inclusion of the evaluation to adherence to the MD into disease-specific dietary guidelines for the management of thyroid nodular disease, in order to reduce the inflammation that paves the way for insulin resistance and, consequently, the increased risk of developing thyroid nodular disease with high-risk category of malignancy; Figure 4. Further clinical studies on the associations between the prevalence of nodular thyroid disease and potential lifestyle characteristics, as dietary pattern including the MD, are warranted to confirm our observations.",a46fc50a-4410-4692-8930-e9e8600da095
