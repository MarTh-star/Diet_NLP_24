0,methods0," This systematic review was conducted following the Cochrane collaboration handbook [23], and is reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses (PRISMA)) Statement [24]. The protocol was published elsewhere [25], and had been previously registered with the international Prospective register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under registration number CRD42018118117.  2.1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  We sought to include randomized controlled trials that met the following inclusion criteria (PICO):  Participants (P): adult patients (i.e., aged ≥ 18) diagnosed with T2DM and or hypertension. The diagnosis of T2DM should have been established according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria (i.e., fasting glycaemia > 200 mg/dL associated with classic T2Dm symptoms; glycaemia 2 h after overload with 75 g of glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL; HbA1c ≥ 6.5%) [12].",58f6edb2-397a-42d7-bdbb-85cc5964365a
1,methods1," Hypertension should be characterized by persistent systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) ≥ 90 mmHg [26].  Types of intervention (I): Nutritional therapy (NT) programs delivered in a primary care setting which focused on stimulating healthy nutrition for a minimum duration of four months. We considered the nutritional strategies that were provided in addition to, and not instead of, the regular pharmacological treatment to T2DM and/or hypertension. We included: (i) educational or counseling programs addressing nutritional recommendations to reduce calories and dietary fat and lifestyle healthy behaviors, (ii) food replacement program followed by stepped reintroduction of meals; (iii) Mediterranean diet, (iv) Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, (v) low carbohydrate diet, (vi) vegetarian diet, (vii) low glycemic index diet, (viii) high protein diet.",86870c3c-0cef-42c1-b251-ab57e9fb6b02
2,methods2," The educational and counseling interventions could be delivered by any health care professional, such as dieticians, physical educators, nurses, psychologists, health educators, physicians, and peer-supporters (i.e., trained in some way in the context of the intervention, although having no formal professional or paraprofessional certificated or degree tertiary education).  Comparison (C): Conventional treatment for T2DM and hypertension, which consisted of pharmacological treatment and general healthy lifestyle advice. An episodic consultation with a dietician, nurse, physical trainer, or educator in diabetes for general healthy lifestyle advice or general nutritional orientation were considered conventional treatment if the patients were not provided subsequent follow up.  Outcomes (O): Primary outcomes were glycemic control and blood pressure control, which were measured by HbA1c (%) and systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (mmHg), respectively.",808ce9c3-3ba6-4431-acbd-eeaac8853e74
3,methods3," The secondary outcomes were frequency of cardiovascular events (acute myocardial infarction and stroke), weight loss (measured as change in weight or in BMI) and death. Outcomes were evaluated at 6, 12 and more than 12 months.  We excluded studies that included patients aged <18 years old, pregnant women, diagnosis of secondary hypertension. Further exclusion criteria were if the intervention was based exclusively on dietary supplements, too low energy diets (less than 600 kcal/day), if the intervention was not delivered in a primary care setting (i.e., studies that recruited patients in the primary setting, but delivered the intervention elsewhere were excluded), and if there was a cointervention not common to both groups.  2.2.",cb3631c0-6aef-4d97-a61c-e58bdc156e7e
4,methods4," Identification of Studies  General search strategies were developed for the main electronic health databases: Embase (1980–2019), Medline though PubMed (1966–2019), LILACS (through Virtual Health Library, 1982–2019) and CENTRAL (Cochrane Collaboration Controlled Trials Register, 1982–2019). A second search on the previously mentioned databases was conducted on 27 December 2021. Search strategies included the following descriptors and synonyms: T2DM OR hypertension—AND—primary health care OR community health planning—AND—nutritional therapy OR lifestyle—AND randomized controlled trial. In PubMed and Embase a filter for randomized controlled trials were applied. There was no language restriction. The full search strategy is on the Supplementary Material (Table S1).",3661c9c6-78b5-419f-abba-b65974b5b122
5,methods5,"  The databases searched for eligible studies included: Trip database, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)), Australasian Medical Index, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database. Furthermore, we searched for studies on ClinicalTrials.gov, the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (Rebec) and grey literature, through abstracts published in annals and lectures. References of relevant primary or secondary studies were screened to identify additional eligible studies. Endnote software was used to download references and remove duplicates.  Two reviewers (RGOFL and JSCG) independently performed the initial screening of titles and abstracts using the software Rayyan QCRI [27]. The studies selected for full-text review were subsequently assessed for adequacy to the proposed PICO.",e946e4e5-2a25-4f31-976e-d2463de6d759
6,methods6," In case of disagreement, there was a consensus meeting between the reviewers and the project coordinator (VdSN-N) for a final decision.  2.3. Data Extraction and Risk of Bias of Included Studies  Two reviewers (LRB and JSCG) used a standardized form to extract relevant data of the included studies (i.e., study identification, publication date, country, sample size, follow up, type of intervention and control, baseline characteristics of patients, and outcome results). To assess the risk of bias of included studies, the same two reviewers used the revised version of the Cochrane tool (RoB 2), which considers bias arising from five domains: (i) the randomization process; (ii) due to deviations from intended interventions (including blinding of patients and personnel, balanced baseline characteristics, and report of measurement of compliance with the intended intervention); (iii) due to missing outcome data; (iv) in measurement of the outcome; and (v) in selection of the reported result.",15b35eb6-2665-4113-8b87-738caebe94a5
7,methods7," To ensure consistency between reviewers, a calibration exercise was performed and in the case of disagreement, a consensus meeting with the project coordinator (VdSN-N) was made. For domain (iii), while we considered a loss of follow up of more than 20% as high risk of bias for RCTs, we allowed a loss of follow up of 30% for pragmatic trials. It was also considered high risk if the loss of follow up was unbalanced between the two groups. For domain (iv) it was considered high risk of bias when the data collection on the outcomes of interest was performed based on patient records instead of a standardized data collection. Finally, for domain (v) we also tracked the published protocols and trials registrations, when available.  2.4.

8,methods8," Similar outcomes in at least 2 studies were plotted in random-effect meta-analyses using the Stata Statistical Software 17 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). The random effects model was chosen as the analytic model for the meta-analysis. Continuous data were expressed as means and SD and the differences between means with 95% CIs were used as estimate of intervention effect. The mean adjusted differences (mean adjusted differences (MAD)) were preferred when available. For studies that reported median and interquartile range, the estimated mean of the sample and SD were obtained from Hozo et al. [28].  For the cluster randomized trials, we used a formula suggested by the Cochrane handbook to find the trial’s effective sample size, which is its original sample size divided by the “design effect.” The design effect can be calculated by:  1 + (M − 1) × ICC, where M is the average cluster size and ICC is the intracluster correlation coefficient [29].",a532409a-af0c-43a2-8067-59a921a89c7a
9,methods9,"  Inconsistencies between the results of the included studies were ascertained by visual inspection of forest plots (no overlap of CIs around the effect estimates of the individual studies) and by Higgins or I2 statistic, in which I2 > 50% indicates a moderate probability of heterogeneity, and by χ2 tests, where p < 0.10 indicates heterogeneity. In the case of statistical heterogeneity, we used meta-regression to explore the causes of the inconsistency. Meta-regression models (with random effects) were adjusted with the MD as a dependent variable; and months of follow-up, type of intervention, risk of bias, if mean adjusted differences (MAD) was used and characteristics of the baseline participants as moderator variables (mean age and mean HbA1c). The Knapp–Hartung correction was used to calculate the significance of the meta-regression coefficients.  2.5.",077dc222-acd3-48a8-a1de-e7f71a099317
10,methods10," Quality of Evidence  The quality of the evidence of the intervention’s effect estimate was assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE)) methodological guideline [30]. To assess the domain imprecision the optimal information size (optimal information size (OIS)) was calculated using the Stata Statistical Software 17 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). A change of 0.5% for the outcome HbA1c, 4 mmHg for the outcome systolic blood pressure (SBP), and 3 mmHg for the outcome diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were considered to be clinically significant. For all outcomes, 0.05 alfa error and 0.20 beta were assumed. The quality of the evidence was rated down for imprecision if the optimal information size (OIS) criterion was not met [30].  3.",5705d8ee-7d34-4be4-9677-ceca3a0e32d3

After reading the title and abstract, 124 references were selected for full reading. The 85 excluded references, and the reasons for exclusion are detailed on Table S2 on the supplementary material. The main reasons for exclusion were non-randomized trial (3 studies), patients did not meet eligibility criteria (8 studies), wrong intervention (10 studies) or intervention inferior to 4 months (14 studies), intervention not delivered in primary care setting (36 studies), wrong comparator (7 studies), wrong outcome (3 studies), cointervention not common to both groups (3 studies) or study protocol (1 study).

In three studies, the intervention was delivered by specialists in diabetes or population health management [32,33,57]. Eight studies were cluster randomized trials [31,33,36,48,49,55,63] and three studies despite the cluster randomization, individual patient data were used for the analysis [32,43,50].  3.2. Risk of Bias  Risk of bias of included studies is shown in Figure 2 and Figure S1 (Supplementary material). For the (ii) domain (i.e., deviation from the intended intervention) there were some concerns for most studies, given the behavioral nature of the educational and counseling interventions and lack of blinding of patients and personnel. Among the studies rated as high risk for the (i) domain (i.e.",c2c8fcfe-a8ea-4c01-b27a-ac155e8a3e25

For the domain missing outcome data, four studies were rated as high risk of bias due to high and unbalanced dropout rates, suggesting that the loss of follow-up was related to the intervention [38,45,48,54].  3.3. Meta-Analysis of NT for Hypertension  The meta-analysis showed an association between NT and reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), MD: −1.79, 95% CI: −3.46 to −0.12, I2: 88.1%, 2840 patients, 9 studies, moderate quality of the evidence, Figure 3A, Table 1). However, meta-analysis did not indicate any clear effect of NT in patients primarily diagnosed with hypertension on systolic blood pressure (SBP) (MD: −2.17, 95%CI −6.81, 2.46, 4518 patients, 9 studies, I2: 88.",9a1da31b-c3ef-4ee5-80d5-5bee92e22d37
14,methods16,"8%, low quality of the evidence, Figure 3B, Table 1). After visual inspection of the forest plot, the high heterogeneity in both meta-analyses was attributed to one study that overestimated the effect of the intervention [62]. In a sensitivity analysis without Hacihasanoğlu et al. [62], the intervention effect on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remained in favor of the intervention, and the MD in systolic blood pressure (SBP) still crossed the line of null effect (Figure S2 Supplementary material).  Subgroup analyses performed according to length of follow-up and sensitivity analyses separating studies that presented the results as mean adjusted differences (MAD) or post-intervention values, and according to risk of bias did not change the effect on blood pressure (Figures S3–S5 on the Supplementary material, respectively).  3.4. Meta-Analysis of NT for T2DM  Meta-analysis of studies assessing the effect of counseling and educational programs on HBA1c favored the intervention (MD: −0.",cf258d91-c5c6-414f-9b36-b944ea599e59

The joint and individual tests for categorical and no categorical covariates gave us a p-value higher than 0.05, indicating no association between these covariates and the size of the treatment effect (Figures S6 and S7 on the Supplementary material). However, through visual inspection of the forest plot, we asserted that two studies overestimated the effect of the intervention [43,45]. A sensitivity meta-analysis excluding these two studies resolved the heterogeneity and still favored the intervention (MD: −0.25, 95% CI: −0.35, −0.16, I2: 24%, 7094 patients, 25 studies, Figure S8 on the Supplementary material).",5169ddf5-2fc8-4ceb-9629-1501fbe2e800
16,methods18,"  Subgroup analyses performed according to length of follow-up and sensitivity analyses separating studies that presented the results as mean adjusted differences (MAD) or post-intervention values, and according to risk of bias did not change the effect on HbA1c (Figures S9–S11 on the supplementary material, respectively).  Meta-analysis of studies assessing the effect of food replacement on HBA1c favored the intervention (MD: −0.54, 95% CI: −0.75, −0.32, I2: 0%, 440 patients, 2 studies, Figure 4B, moderate quality of the evidence, Table 1).  Secondary Outcomes  Among studies assessing educational and counseling NT for T2DM, the meta-analyses of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and BMI did not show a statistical difference between groups (MD: −0.84, 95% CI: −1.85, 0.16, I2: 44.8%, 5508 patients, 14 studies, Figure S12 on the Supplementary Material; MD: 0.07 95%CI: −0.19, 0.05, I2: 24.5%, 2378 patients, 11 studies, Figure S13 on the Supplementary Material, respectively).",8f43c808-7bab-468f-9f08-89fe253da7b1
17,methods19," For systolic blood pressure (SBP), a trend of no effect was identified (MD: −2.56, 95% CI: −5.5 to 0.38, I2: 83.6%, 5508 patients, 15 studies, Figure S14 on the Supplementary Material), but in a sensitivity analysis without Javaid et al. [45] (a study which overestimated the intervention), the heterogeneity was resolved and the reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) showed to be significant (MD: −1.68, 95% CI: −2.98, −0.38, I2: 0%, 5264 patients, 14 studies, Figure S15 on the Supplementary Material).  3.5. Publication Bias  Publication bias was investigated for HbA1c outcome. Since asymmetries in the funnel plot was not observed, the Egger test was performed (p: 0.988, Figure S16 on the Supplementary Material), indicating no publication bias.  3.6. Studies Not Included in the Meta-Analysis  Only 1 study assessed the effect of Mediterranean diet on T2DM, and therefore it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis [58].

Patients in the intervention groups presented mean HbA1c of 8.4 (standard error (SE): 0.003), which dropped to 7.8 (SE: 0.03) after 6 months, but it was not maintained (i.e., mean HbA1c at 12 and 24 months were both 8.4, SE: 0.03).  The secondary outcomes mortality and frequency of cardiovascular events were not evaluated by the primary studies included in this review, and therefore, were not assessed.  4. Discussion  In this systematic review, we identified three NT strategies evaluated in primary care: counseling and educational programs, food replacement programs and Mediterranean diet. Only one study on Mediterranean diet in primary care was identified [58], and it was not included in a meta-analysis.",f927e008-4678-4414-ac16-53c6691488d3
19,methods21," The included studies reported the metabolic targets as main outcomes, such as glycemic control, blood pressure reduction and BMI. However, no study reported the outcomes mortality or frequency of cardiovascular events.  According to the meta-analyses, NT in primary care likely reduces HbA1c in patients with T2DM. With moderate quality of the evidence, counseling and educational programs were associated with a mean change of −0.37 in HbA1c and food replacement programs with a mean change in HbA1c of −0.54, both when compared to usual care. In addition, counseling and educational programs slightly reduce diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (MD: −1.79) in patients with hypertension when compared to usual care. It was not possible to ascertain an association of NT with change in systolic blood pressure (SBP).  The effectiveness of NT in the management of T2DM and hypertension have been investigated in systematic reviews, although none had focused exclusively on the primary care setting.",fc83271b-d17b-4e23-abf1-e53acd90f1af
20,methods22," Patients with T2DM and hypertension are mostly managed in the primary healthcare level, and access to specialized medical nutritional therapy is limited [18]. The lack of training on nutritional advice and patient overload often makes lifestyle interventions challenging for primary care nurses and physicians [11].  The systematic review by Kalyoncu et al. investigated the effectiveness of nutrition-based practices in prevention of hypertension but focused on healthy young adults [21]. Nicolson et al. performed a meta-analysis of five studies comparing antihypertensive medication versus lifestyle interventions (without antihypertensive), and likewise had inconclusive results on systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction [22]. However, distinct from the review form Nicolson et al., in our review NT was often offered in combination to antihypertensive medications as part of the standard care at the primary care clinic. Besides, our review included more studies published after 2004.",33e6e2b6-9694-49af-adef-9348996fd52e
21,methods23,"  Previous systematic reviews investigating the effectiveness of NT in T2DM had focused mainly on weight loss among obese patients [17], or T2DM prevention among healthy patients at risk for T2DM [19]. In addition, the benefit of group-based self-management education in reducing HbA1c had been previously indicated in a systematic review [20]. However, the inclusion criteria of this previous systematic review were restricted to group-based educational programs [20]. Moreover, two robust studies were published after this systematic review was carried out, which were now included in our analyses [34,47]. Furthermore, García-Molina et al. conducted a meta-analysis of studies assessing the effectiveness of lifestyle intervention (educational programs) in T2DM management [18]. García-Molina et al. found a weighted mean difference of −0.51 in HbA1c, a reduction that is more pronounced than the results from our meta-analysis.",e2af9e57-94bc-451c-85bf-9685537bf741
22,methods24," Although the inclusion criteria were similar to those used in our review, our review excluded studies conducted in settings other than the primary care, assessed separately patients with hypertension and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to assess the quality of the evidence.  Among the studies included in our meta-analyses, three studies had clustered samples (i.e., subjects were randomized at a group level), but the results were analyzed at an individual level [32,43,50]. By not taking clustering into account, the results may show significance where none exists [70]. Moreover, in one study there was no allocation concealment (i.e., subjects with even numbers were allocated to the intervention arm, while odd number subjects to the control arm) [45]. The individual-level analysis in a clustered sample in Hörnsten et al. [43], and the lack of allocation concealment in Javaid et al.",a5b95f79-2843-4bfe-8797-1d4db78bd063
23,methods25," [45], may explain the overestimated effect on HbA1c in both studies identified in the meta-analysis. Hence, we conducted sensitivity analysis, and the effect in favor of the intervention was maintained.  Some limitations to our results must be acknowledged. First, we could not evaluate the effect of NT on hard outcomes such as mortality and frequency of cardiovascular events. The surrogate continuous outcomes evaluated allow a limited interpretation of the real clinical impact of the interventions. For HbA1c, a change of 0.5% is considered as clinically significant [71,72]. For blood pressure, a reduction of 10 mmHg is associated with a reduction of 17% in coronary artery disease incidence, 27% in stroke, 28% in heart failure and 13% in all-cause mortality [73]. When considering these cutoffs to extrapolate the correlation of blood pressure and HbA1c reduction on long term complications and mortality, the effect of NT is arguable.",c2062af6-8c86-4c46-9c64-43ee300881b8
24,methods26," For instance, the mean change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in patients with hypertension identified in our meta-analysis, although statistically significant, was notably lower than what could be regarded as clinically significant. Second, during data extraction, it was not possible to ensure that the studies considered equivalent variables for the calculation of the mean adjusted differences (MAD).  Third, there was noticeable variability among the educational programs provided by the included studies, regarding intensity of the intervention, the professional responsible for delivering the intervention and the content of the intervention. While some educational interventions followed a nutrition education curriculum [48,52], others were based on motivational interviewing [42], or culturally tailored self-management interventions [35,53,58]. Moreover, some programs provided broad lifestyle modification advice, entailing promotion of regular physical activity.",e249a9fb-0b01-4b04-a7b1-768000ad233b
25,methods27," The choice of the best suited intervention might be influenced by previous local practices, logistic capacities, and cultural aspects, although the common aspect of these educational and counseling programs was that the NT was offered as part of a coordinated care in a primary setting [11].  Lifestyle modification is a central aspect to the management of patients with T2DM and hypertension [12]. Although the implementation of lifestyle and nutritional interventions in the primary care setting is challenging, the effect of educational programs on the management of hypertension (i.e., reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) and T2DM, and food replacement for the management of T2DM have been extensively studied, although future studies could help establish the effect of NT on systolic blood pressure (SBP). These results may contribute to further implementing NT in the primary care setting. Moreover, NT programs tailored for the primary care should be encouraged.  5.",44f41e35-b967-4518-a5ea-bb5f3ba28f04
26,methods28," Conclusions  Nutritional therapy strategies (i.e., educational/counseling programs and food replacement programs) in primary care improved the glycemic control in patients with T2DM and educational programs in primary care improved diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in individuals with hypertension. NT programs tailored for the primary care should be encouraged. ",d296d0ee-8fb7-47d5-87b8-cf057325f60c
