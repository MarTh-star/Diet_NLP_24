This solution was diluted with methanol to 150 µM. 2 ml of the 150 µM solution were mixed with 2 ml of methanol to record the spectra of the hybrids alone, or with 2 ml of the salts solution (300 µM). Then, the absorption spectra of the antioxidants (75 μM) alone or in the presence of CuSO4, FeSO4, FeCl3 or ZnCl2 (150 μM) mixed for 30 min in methanol at room temperature were recorded in a 1 cm quartz cell.  2.4 In Vitro Assays  The human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line was purchased with eight passage numbers from the American Type Culture Collection (20099 Sesto San Giovanni, Milan, Italy), and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)) (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum (FBS)), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, into a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C).",53b6daa5-0bb5-4be8-ac6e-425679a76768

Dissolved formazan crystals can be quantified using a spectrophotometer and the values obtained are in direct correlation to the number of metabolically active cells. For this reason, this colorimetric assay is used to evaluate cell viability.  The MTT assay was performed as reported in literature .",2691ed67-7aab-4c4f-982d-eb31c5025f4b
11,methods11," SH-SY5Y were placed in 96-well microplates at a density of 6 × 103 and, the next day, were treated with the donepezil hybrids for 24 h.

The optical density was measured at wavelengths of 540 and 690 nm using a spectrophotometer (X MARK Spectrophotometer Microplate Bio-Rad).  In the last experiment, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with donepezil hybrids for 21 h at the concentrations shown in the Figure 5C.

12,methods12," H2DCF remains trapped within cells and is oxidized by intracellular Reactive oxygen species (ROS) to form the highly fluorescent DCF compound. Spectrofluorimetric quantification of the DCF probe, provides the content of the Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell.  SH-SY5Y cells were plated in 96-well microplates at a density of 6 × 104 and, the following day, were treated with donepezil hybrids for 24 h. At the end of the treatment period, to ensure that the compounds used were not degraded, cells were exposed to fresh donepezil hybrids for an additional 3 hours. Subsequently, the growth medium was replaced with a fresh phenol red-free medium containing H2DCF-DA (25 μM). After 30 min at 37°C, the cells were washed twice to remove the extracellular H2DCF-DA, centrifuged, re-suspended in PBS, exposed to H2O2 (100 μM, 30 min) and the fluorescence was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis using a FACS Accury laser flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).",e4d61db3-6bbd-4d28-bee7-d88007ebaaa9

H2O2 alone was used as a positive control.  2.5 Prediction of Pharmacokinetic Properties  To analyze the drug like properties of the new hybrids, the prediction of the main pharmacokinetic properties was performed in silico. A comparison with hydroxytyrosol and donepezil was performed, too. Two free softwares “ADMETlab 2.0” supported by Xiangya School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University ADMETlab 2.0 (2021) https://admetmesh.scbdd.com, and “admetSAR 2.0” supported by the School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology admetSAR 2.0 (019) http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar2/ were used. The main properties considered were the lipo-hydrophilic character (logP), the permeability after oral administration (Caco-2 cell permeability), and blood-brain barrier (blood brain barrier (BBB)) penetration.",87bfee1f-d471-4dd5-8bca-ab82d9e1c40c
14,methods14," Finally, the agreement with Lipinski’s rules was evaluated for all compounds.  3 Results  3.1 Chemistry  It is thought to combine the hydroxytyrosol in the donepezil structure, in place of the indanone moiety, to obtain new hybrids with potential antioxidant and metal-chelating activity. First, considering the reactivity and sensitivity of the catechol moiety of the hydroxytyrosol (HT), we worked with the acetonide precursor (Supplementary Figure S1) of the HT in a direct oxidative condensation (Mori and Togo, 2005) and in different eco-friendly transesterification reactions (Remme et al., 2007; Climent at al., 2010), but only the Steglich esterification method has given us the hybrid in good yields (English and Williams, 2009). Unfortunately, the product was disrupted during the subsequent deprotection step. Then, we tried to use the HT directly in an old esterification reaction (Brook and Chan, 1983), as reported in Figure 2A.",cd969d87-b27b-4895-a33f-70af445503cb
15,methods15," The HT was esterified with the N-benzylpiperidine-4-carboxylic acid using trimethylsilyl chloride as a reagent. This allows us to esterify the HT only on the primary alcohol and not on the phenolic -OH. This method was more advantageous due to an easy operation, mild reaction conditions, simple workup and good yields. The procedure was developed considering the chemical-physical characteristics of the selected alcohols and optimized by taking the use of non-toxic solvents into account, as possible (See Table 1). The best reaction conditions were founded working at 40°C in THF for 6 days (entry 3, Table 1). This protocol was applied to the other selected polyphenolic alcohols: nitro-HT (2), homovanillyl alcohol (3), and tyrosol (4). Only for the 2-nitro-HT (2) the reaction yield was low. For this reason, we decided to perform nitration reaction  directly on the hybrid HT1, with a yield of 55% (Figure 2B).",3e7e6787-5b57-440b-906e-f651f1bfc310
16,methods16," After that, in order to enhance the brain barrier permeation and the bioavailability, we carried out the acetylation of the phenolic groups using a green MW-assisted methodology, previously developed in our laboratory (Figure 2C) . The yields for this reaction were excellent, except for the nitro-compound. In fact, the acetylated nitro hybrid, rapidly hydrolyzed the protecting group to obtain the starting unprotected analogue. Although the compound was detected by high-resolution mass spectrometry (high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)) in the reaction crude (Supplementary Figure S2), it was not isolated in a pure form. All compounds were purified by column chromatography. The structures were verified by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The spectra and the chemical characterization can be found in the Supplementary Material.  FIGURE 2 Schematic synthesis of the donepezil hybrids.

17,methods18," In particular, dysregulation of Cu2+, Zn2+, Fe2+ and Fe3+ can contribute to the Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via the Fenton and Habere Weiss reaction. Then, in light of the bio-metal hypothesis of the AD pathogenesis, we tested the unprotected phenolic hybrids on the chelation properties of these redox-active metals. Since acetylation masks the key reactive portion of the phenols structure, and considering the transient nature of the acetylation as chemical modification enhancing the cellular intake, we decided to perform the in vitro chemical test on the unprotected derivatives. As shown in Figure 3A, the compound HT1, derived from HT was able to chelate only Copper (II) efficiently. Instead, the compound HT2, i.e., the nitro-HT hybrid, chelates all the metal cations (Figure 3B).  FIGURE 3 Metal chelating activity of compounds HT1 (A) and HT2 (B).",6d934f42-065c-45ab-b53e-611c34cb14c6

HT alone was also analyzed for comparison. The oxygen-radical absorbance capacity measured by fluorescence is a method that evaluates the antioxidant activity through a hydrogen atom transfer (hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)) mechanism. The results reported in Table 2 demonstrate that all compounds are more active than Trolox, a synthetic hydrophilic vitamin E analogue used as the reference compound.",e977f940-4634-486f-b176-64e9b65f8c41

The cupric reducing antioxidant capacity test is defined as an electron transfer (ET)-based assay for the evaluation of antioxidant action.,2f51cdff-48f4-4fcb-b9e1-b139d33fbe76
20,methods22," As for the ORAC test, the antioxidant capacity of the tested hybrids was experimentally measured as Trolox equivalents, and HT was also analysed for comparison. As shown in Table 2, all hybrids demonstrated antioxidant activities comparable or higher than Trolox. HT1 was the more active compound (entry 1, Table 2), showing an antioxidant capacity higher than HT on its own (entry 8, Table 2). Otherwise, as shown in the ORAC test, the reduction in the antioxidant capacity for the nitro hybrid HT2 (entry 3, Table 2) is less pronounced, and its activity is almost high. Among the hybrids, the derivative HT4 possesses the lower antioxidant activity (entry 6, Table 2), although it is comparable with Trolox.  3.4 Biological Tests  In order to evaluate the activity of donepezil hybrids on a biological level, we tested their role on human neurons SH-SY5Y, a neuroblastoma cell line widely used to study the neurotoxicity in vitro.",d7458155-cd2b-4858-88ed-1dda95003752
21,methods23," First, we have assessed the impact of these compounds on cell viability in order to know their potential toxicity. Subsequently, since most neurodegenerative diseases have oxidative damage as common denominator, we wanted to study if donepezil hybrids had an antioxidant effect.  3.4.1 Assessment of Cell Viability  The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was exposed to increasing concentrations of these compounds (0.25–100 μM) for 24 h and, under these experimental conditions, all hybrids showed negligible cell death under 1 μM (Figure 4). Furthermore, data showed that all compounds are not toxic in the 1–10 μM range, and are stable in these experimental conditions. In particular, a reduction in cell viability was found for compounds HT3a and HT4a at concentrations higher than 10 μM, probably due to the higher permeability of the acetylated form.  FIGURE 4 Effects of donepezil hybrids on cell viability in human neuroblastoma cells.",efb881af-0af9-4cb3-bedf-1c669d290bf1
22,methods24," Human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell line was treated with donepezil hybrids for 24 h at the concentrations shown in the figure. The cell viability was measured through the MTT assay.

Three independent experiments were carried out, with values expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. *p < 0.05 vs. control; **p < 0.01 vs. control; ***p < 0.001 vs. control. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was followed by a Tukey–Kramer comparison test.  3.4.2 Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species and Neuroprotection  Preliminary experiments were carried out in order to evaluate if donepezil hybrids had pro-oxidant effects. For this reason, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with the indicated compounds for 24 h and endogenous Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured. H2O2 was used as positive control.",0ae26c98-cee0-4ac7-9093-d55ab1922b40
23,methods25," As can be seen in Supplementary Figure S3, no compound has resulted in an accumulation of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the indicated concentrations (0.25–100 μM). Subsequently, the antioxidant properties of the compounds were evaluated and conditions of oxidative stress in neuroblastoma cells were simulated by using H2O2 as toxic insult. The treatment time, with H2O2 used to produce an accumulation of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) (30 min), did not cause reduction in cell viability. In order to obtain a significant reduction in viability we need to treat SH-SY5Y cells for 3 hours or more (see Supplementary Figure S4). Thus, exposure to H2O2 for 30 min causes only oxidative damage. In particular, Figures 5A,B shows the protective effect against H2O2, and among all concentrations used, those with the most protective effects were highlighted. The Reactive oxygen species (ROS) values corresponding to the other concentrations are summarised in Table 2.",7f970533-9430-49aa-b331-31c7b3497688
24,methods26," The nitro hybrid HT2 was the more effective one to reduce the Reactive oxygen species (ROS) amount to the physiological values. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that for the compounds HT3, the higher antioxidant effect it was measured in the acetylated form (HT3a). Then, the IC50 values are reported in Table 3, together with the potential therapeutic index of these hybrids (expressed by the ratio between the concentration of the hybrid that causes a toxic effect and the concentration that causes an antioxidant effect in neuronal cells). As shown in Table 3, all hybrids possess a neurotoxic concentration higher than the concentration showing antioxidant activity. Compound HT1 showed the best therapeutic index ratio, while for compound HT3a the lower value was calculated, although it is equal to 10.",82964bff-4124-4d47-833e-b06190e5134a
25,methods27," Finally, to confirm the promising results obtained with the evaluation of antioxidant activity, we investigated whether donepezil hybrids were able to reduce the proliferative damage induced by exposure to H2O2. As shown in Figure 5C the co-treatment with donepezil hybrids and H2O2 had shown a protective effect. In particular, HT2, HT3a and HT4a showed a statistically significant increase in cell viability compared to the effect caused by treatment with hydrogen peroxide alone.

(2021), and admetSAR 2.0 developed by Yang et al. (2018). The octanol/water partition coefficient (logP or AlogP, respectively) was calculated as an essential parameter for Lipinski’s rule of five. In all cases, the calculated logP was lower than 5, and all hybrids respect Lipinski’s rule of five (Table 4). The expected permeability of these new compounds for the Caco-2 cell line, as a model for the absorption prediction after oral administration, and the blood brain barrier (BBB) were also evaluated.",d87184b0-af78-4c7e-a57a-2eb4265e1630
28,methods30," On these two parameters, some discordant results were registered by the two prediction models. For the ADMETlab software, the predicted Caco-2 permeability (given as the log cm/s) is considered excellent if it has a predicted value higher than −5.15 log cm/s. Among the new hybrids, only compound HT1 was found to have a predicted value lower than −5.15, while according to the admetSAR software, compounds HT1, HT1a, and HT2 showed a certain probability of not being permeable. Otherwise, the prediction on the blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration was calculated as highly favorable for all new hybrids, except for compounds HT4 and HT4a, by the admetSAR software, while the ADMETlab prediction model has considered excellent values for HT1, HT3, HT4 (range 0.7–1.0), and medium values for the others (range 0.3–0.7). All hybrids were also compared with HT alone and donepezil.",a295e551-f447-487a-b460-b7c303068557

Diverse authors demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of the HT derivatives against not only AD  but also against PD .",ab2bd3a4-3d1c-4152-a5bb-75e980aa694b
30,methods33," In light of these pieces of evidence, we tried to insert the HT into the donepezil structure to exploit its neuroprotection effect. Then, we planned to also synthesize tyrosol and homovanillyl alcohol hybrids to evaluate the influence of the ortho-diphenolic moiety in the tested biological activities. Noteworthy is the presence of a nitrocatechol moiety in two catechol O-methyltransferase (catechol O methyltransferase (COMT)) inhibitors such as tolcapone and entacapone, included in the clinical treatment of PD . Furthermore, several studies demonstrated a remarkable activity of nitro-HT derivatives in the dopamine metabolism, suggesting a putative effect against PD as novel and lipophilic catechol O methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors .",a46f51fc-2ace-494a-98e9-65854e6f9027
31,methods34," First, we tested the chelating ability of all these hybrids in their unprotected form, since the primary role of the acetyl groups is that of enhancing the analogues bioavailability. Only HT1 and HT2 showed metal chelating properties, highlighting the importance of the catechol moiety in the metal coordination. In particular the presence of a nitro-group allowed to chelate not only Cu(II), but also the other redox-active metal ions Fe(II), Fe(III), and Zn(II). The cell viability of these hybrids was evaluated to exclude a potential cytotoxic effect. Encouraging results were obtained for all of the hybrids, which did not show substantial cell death until 1 µM concentration. Another crucial issue, related to the employment of natural polyphenol compounds is that, in some cases, they could act as pro-oxidants causing DNA damage and mutagenesis, depending on the concentration or the cellular environment (León-González et al., 2015; Eghbaliferiz and Iranshahi, 2016).",2d48ab23-430f-41a9-a1a6-d7fd4ab46305
32,methods35," To exclude a pro-oxidant effect for these new hybrids, the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line, was treated for 24 h with them, using H2O2 as a positive control. The measurement of the endogenous Reactive oxygen species (ROS) did not show pro-oxidant effects even at the highest concentrations for all hybrids (Supplementary Figure S3). This important result, together with the cell viability, was fundamental to assess the treatment assurance with the target compounds. Then, conditions of oxidative stress in neuroblastoma cells were simulated by using H2O2 as toxic insult. Some of these hybrids, HT3a and HT2, significantly showed protective effects against the damage induced by H2O2 at 100 µM. In particular, HT2 showed the highest antioxidant capacity preventing the Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation evoked by H2O2 in SH-SY5Y cells, and restoring the Reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration to the physiological values.",04755ee1-8c82-4358-a1a0-5dab33c75d54
33,methods36," In the attempt, to elucidate the mechanism of the antioxidant activity for the synthesized compounds in the unprotected form, two different and complementary chemical tests were performed. ORAC and Cupric Reducing Antioxidant Capacity (CUPRAC) tests were selected as hydrogen atom transfer (hydrogen atom transfer (HAT))- and electron transfer (ET)-based assays, respectively. The antioxidant activities of the unprotected compounds were provided in Trolox equivalent and comparatively studied against results obtained free HT. Surprisingly, discordant results were obtained for the two tests, in particular for the nitro-hybrids HT2, which seemed to be the less active in the ORAC test, although maintaining high antioxidant capacity in the Cupric Reducing Antioxidant Capacity (CUPRAC) test.",b894ef5f-7334-4170-8e0a-afd1fd87a949
34,methods37," On the contrary, the HT3 was the more active in the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)-based ORAC assay, while showing a not excellent antioxidant capacity in the electron transfer (ET)-based Cupric Reducing Antioxidant Capacity (CUPRAC) assay. Although these chemical tests only possess a predictive valence, these results suggest that both the direct scavenging capability of the homovanillyl hybrid HT3 and the reducing capacity of the nitro hybrid HT2 are very important for the resulting antioxidant activity. It is worth noting that for the homovanillyl hybrid the best result on the Reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduction was obtained by the acetylated compound HT3a, showing the importance of cell permeability in the expression of the biological activity. Moreover, these preliminary results meet the margin of safety measured for the two hybrids through the therapeutic index, (higher for compound HT2 than HT3a), allowing further investigation of these promising compounds.",2afb30bc-f5f1-4ee3-a45a-fa822982acf8
35,methods38," Neuroprotection activity against the cytotoxicity elicited by H2O2 was also assessed by measuring the cell viability using MTT assay. As already reported about the Reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduction, hybrids HT2 and HT3a were able to attenuate cell injury against oxidative stress. Finally, to assess the potential of these compounds as drugs, some pharmacokinetics properties were calculated in silico. Two different prediction models were employed to evaluate the agreement with Lipinski’s rule of five, the Caco-2 cell line permeability and the blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration. For compound HT3a, the two different softwares predicted almost good results for all of the parameters, while discordant results were registered by the two prediction models for compound HT2. On one hand, the ADMETlab 2.0 software predicted medium blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration and good Caco-2 cell permeability. On the other hand, the admetSAR 2.",439a7ea4-0f22-4a03-9e67-eab9860f9c60
36,methods39,"0 software considered not excellent permeation properties together with very good value for the blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Although the pharmacokinetic properties of all the hybrids are less favorable in terms of Caco-2 permeability or blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration than those of donepezil, we obtained better results with HT2 and HT3a, if compared to just HT. Thus confirming the goal to enhance the HT activity towards the Central Nervous System, these encouraging results could suggest that these two hybrids could be eligible as drug candidates.  In conclusion, we report the synthesis of new biophenol-donepezil hybrids for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. These new synthetic hybrids were obtained in good yields. Chemical and biological assays were performed in order to evaluate their multi target directed ligand effects. These preliminary results on the antioxidant activity highlighted the efficacy of compounds HT2 and HT3a.",3daee10d-35fe-41c5-b50e-e913d88d8190
37,methods40," In particular, the homovanillyl hybrid HT3a possesses a good antioxidant capacity, probably through a hydrogen transfer mechanism. The higher activity measured in the cell culture for the acetylated compound confirmed the importance of the cell membrane permeation to carry out the biological activity. As for the HT2 hybrid, bringing a nitro group onto the HT moiety, it showed interesting metal chelating properties associated with negligible cellular toxicity, as well as an electron-transfer antioxidant power. Such differentiated mechanisms of action enhance the possible biological applications of these polyphenols-donepezil hybrids, paving the way to other different targets in the neurodegenerative disorders.
