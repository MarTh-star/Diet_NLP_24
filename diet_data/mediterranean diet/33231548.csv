0,methods0," We analyzed participants belonging to the first and fourth quartiles of age (Q1 and Q4, respectively) to compare between-group differences in adherence to the nutritional intervention and cardiovascular risk factor (cardiovascular risk factor (CRF)) control during a 3-year follow-up. All participants underwent yearly clinical, nutritional, and laboratory assessments during the following.   Study participants and design  The PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) study (www.predimed.es) was a nutritional intervention–based randomized trial, single-blind, multicenter (11 centres throughout Spain) study carried out on 7447 participants at high vascular risk, but no Cardiovascular disease (CVD) at enrolment, conducted from October 2003 to December 2010. The aim of this primary prevention study was to assess the long-term effects of the MedDiet on incident Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in men and women aged 55–80 years at high Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.",a593ff5b-dc5a-49b7-bd94-368d2bb3704b
1,methods1," The protocol, methods, design, and eligibility criteria for this study have been reported in detail elsewhere [9]. Briefly, participants were assigned to one of three nutritional interventions by a computer-generated random-number sequence: a traditional MedDiet supplemented with either complementary extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or tree nuts and a control diet based on advice to follow an low fat diet (LFD).  In the current study, we analyzed data of participants belonging to the first (n = 1091) and fourth (n = 1187) quartiles of baseline age to compare dietary intake, adherence to the nutritional interventions, and cardiovascular risk factor (CRF) control. We included a total of 2278 participants with complete information on food consumption and nutrient intake, adiposity, and cardiovascular risk factor (CRF)s at baseline and after 3 years of follow-up.",90693a00-cac8-490c-860d-62cd5f17dfb1
2,methods2,"  Assessments and intervention  Throughout the study, participants in the MedDiet groups had face-to-face interviews with a dietitian (yearly) and at group sessions (every 3 months) in which they received instructions and written material with information on seasonal Mediterranean foods, shopping lists, weekly meal plans, and cooking recipes for a typical week. They were instructed to follow the allocated diets, with different sessions for each intervention group. During the group sessions with dietitians and according to treatment allocation, participants in the two MedDiet groups were provided with either 1 L per week of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (to consume at least 50 mL/day) or mixed nuts (30 g/day: 15 g walnuts, 7.5 g hazelnuts, and 7.5 g almonds) at no cost.",32aa5f2f-2f7f-4a42-a12a-b00ba742735c
3,methods3," Participants in the low fat diet (LFD) group also had individual and group sessions quarterly with the dietitian, were given information and written material on the low fat diet (LFD) (according to the American Heart Association guidelines), and received non-food gifts. None of the three groups received advice on energy restriction or promotion of physical activity.  A validated 14-point MedDiet screener was used to assess adherence to the MedDiet [20], while a nine-item questionnaire was used to evaluate adherence to the low fat diet (LFD) [9]. Also, at baseline and yearly during follow-up, dietitians administered in face-to-face interviews a 137-item validated food-frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [21], used to assess energy and nutrients using Spanish food-composition tables [22].",acf0b9f0-1391-4c7d-b29e-c032ea8d6b6d
4,methods4," The Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire and a 47-item questionnaire on education, lifestyle, history of illnesses, and medication use were also administered at baseline and yearly.  Clinical measurements  Trained personnel performed anthropometric measurements. Height and weight of volunteers were measured using a wall‐mounted stadiometer and calibrated scales, respectively. Waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest using an anthropometric tape. Blood pressure (BP) was measured in triplicate with a validated semiautomatic oscillometer (Omron HEM-705CP, Hoofddorp, Netherlands).  In addition, fasting blood and spot urine were obtained and plasma, serum, and buffy coats stored at − 80 °C until assay.",8200dddb-b21d-455a-9b54-0712ad004134

19,discussion0," The present results show that adherence to the nutritional intervention implemented in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) trial was similar between older (Q4, ≥ 71 years old) and younger (Q1, ≤ 62 years old) participants and was maintained throughout a 3-year follow-up. Both cohorts had increased their scores on the 14-item MedDiet questionnaire by 1.6–2 points at the end of the intervention. As a result, improvement in cardiovascular risk factor (CRF) control was also similar in the two groups. In concordance, subgroup analyses on the primary outcome of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) trial also revealed similar Cardiovascular disease (CVD)-risk reduction with the MedDiet in participants aged < 70 years and ≥ 70 years [9].  While comparisons of dietary intake and MedDiet adherence with younger participants was not possible due to inclusion criteria (aged 55–80 years), some differences has been observed.",6477b000-9ac2-4bf6-a558-b9e1e7f6d88f
20,discussion1," Although younger and older subjects reached similar overall adherence to the MedDiet (10.1 vs 10.0 of 14 points, respectively), some between-group differences deserve to be mentioned. At the end of the intervention, a lower proportion of Q4 participants had achieved recommended doses of OO, nuts, fruit, legumes, and commercial sweets, while a higher percentage had reached recommended doses of red meat, dietary milk, and alcohol than Q1 participants.  The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and other epidemiological studies have revealed that intake of beneficial nutrients, such as complex carbohydrates, fibre, MUFAs, and PUFAs, is reduced in older individuals, while intake of unhealthy nutrients, such as SFAs, is increased [23–25].",7ca94ea3-853d-4194-9a32-3c48ed149e69
21,discussion2," Data from our study showed that independently of age, allocation to the two MedDiet groups resulted in significant reductions in SFA intake and increased intake of MUFA and fibre, while PUFA intake increased only in participants allocated to the MedDiet supplemented with nuts. Higher fibre intake can be related to healthy dietary changes, such as higher consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, and nuts. In fact, higher intake of MUFAs, PUFAs, and fibre can have a protective effect against such age-related disorders as cognitive decline, Cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, and cancer, as well as development of frailty [8–11, 18, 26–30]. Furthermore, it should be noted that while both MedDiet groups from the Q4 group significantly increased marine ω3 FA intake, only those allocated to the MedDiet supplemented with nuts significantly increased α-linolenic intake, as expected from the richness of walnuts in this FA.",fbc2f815-6de3-44ef-b0a2-8e1431639c03
22,discussion3," Importantly, intake of long-chain PUFAs, such as marine ω3 FAs and α-linolenic acid, is associated with improved cognition and reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias [28, 29, 31].  Ageing is frequently associated with malnutrition, particularly in frail individuals, due to such factors as hyporexia, decreased saliva production, disturbances in taste and smell, and biological changes, such as alterations in ghrelin and cholecystokinin production, as well as polypharmacy effects [14, 16]. Epidemiological studies have shown that compared to young people, the average daily caloric intake is lower in the elderly by approximately 1000 and 700 kcal/day in men and women, respectively [24]. Also, an observational study reported that a significant proportion of persons aged > 80 years had a daily energy intake < 20 kcal/kg body weight [32].",094eb43b-0462-44e7-b4ec-e4efea00c39c
23,discussion4," However, in our study, daily energy intake at the end of the study was lower in Q1 and Q4 participants in the low fat diet (LFD) group than the two MedDiet groups, whose intake of protein and fat was maintained or even increased. In other reports on elderly people, animal-protein intake was reduced, which was attributed in part to difficulty chewing and swallowing [33]. It is well established that old people must maintain adequate daily protein intake as a preventive measure to preserve skeletal muscle mass and avoid sarcopenia and frailty [34].  As stated in most guidelines, non-pharmacological measures are the first therapeutic approach to improve control of cardiovascular risk factor (CRF)s and reduce incidence of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) [5, 12, 13].",181744ab-9d67-44c5-bd1b-a8c36e8903ab
24,discussion5," However, there is concern whether elderly persons are capable of improving unhealthy lifestyle habits and maintaining beneficial changes in the long run, probably because changes associated with ageing, such as loss of appetite (reduced taste and smell), loneliness, eating alone, depression, and low income, can influence food choices and dietary habits [14–16]. The usefulness of non-pharmacological measures to reduce Cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence or improve nutritional status in elderly people has recently been reviewed [35]. While the evidence is of low quality, because it was based on heterogeneous results obtained from small cohorts with short follow-up periods [35–42], the results are encouraging. Adherence to a MedDiet intervention for 6 months in a cohort of 166 elders (mean age 71 years) was high (85%) and associated with lower BP and improvement in endothelial function [36].",93d8da25-dc76-4fd8-aec8-805dec903371
25,discussion6," Likewise, adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet for ≤ 3 months in two cohorts of aged Asian individuals was also high and resulted in lower BP [37–39]. Also, a multicomponent nutritional telemonitoring intervention applied for 6 months in elderly people (mean age 78 years) at risk of undernutrition showed good adherence and resulted in improved diet quality and nutritional status [40]. The NU-AGE project conducted on a cohort of 1141 elderly European subjects demonstrated that it is possible to change dietary habits of elders towards a healthier diet that can improve cognitive and bone health [41]. On the other hand, regarding physical activity, preliminary data from the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus study have revealed that it is also feasible to increase physical activity in old people in the long run (12 months) [42], which confirms findings from a recent meta-analysis [43].",0b6d3c9b-0678-4de7-a711-f0c77b0f4750
26,discussion7," Other studies, however, have shown negative results [44, 45].  Our study has strengths, such as the clinical trial design, repeated data collection, validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), standardized measurements of clinical and nutritional variables, a relatively large sample (2200 patients), and long-follow-up (3 years). The main limitations are the use of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) may have led to a misclassification of the exposure due to an overestimation of food intake and the fact that dietary data are self-reported. In addition, self-reported questionnaires about diet, physical activity and other medical data can lead to misclassification, which would attenuate the association of the exposure variables with the outcome. Furthermore, potential residual confounding and the lack of generalizability of the results to other populations are limitations in this study.",a2e12768-450c-4a51-959e-5353ddcb2f00
27,discussion8," Unmeasured confounders may have distorted results for predictors of dietary adherence, though analyses were adjusted for a wide array of confounders, and a strong confounder unrelated to these characteristics is unlikely. Finally, the findings in our Mediterranean cohort of individuals at high cardiovascular risk cannot easily be extrapolated to other populations.  Conclusion  We report that persons aged > 70 years can improve their dietary habits and adhere in the long term to an enhanced MedDiet in a similar way to younger adult individuals. This goal was reached in part because participants were taught and trained with high intensity by motivated dietitians and received key MedDiet foods for free. As a healthy and high-quality diet, the MedDiet was associated with reduced potency of cardiovascular risk factor (CRF)s to a similar extent in elderly and younger individuals.",23302ef9-9dac-4cce-875c-68ebaf664a05
28,discussion9," The benefits of the MedDiet for non-communicable diseases include reduced rates of diabetes and some cancers, lower BP, and improved cognition, as described in other PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) reports [18, 19, 29, 30]. The take-home message is that we should not miss the opportunity to apply such non-pharmacological measures as the MedDiet, which has high efficacy without adverse effects, to improve the overall health of aged people. It is never too late to change dietary habits to achieve healthy ageing.  Supplementary Information  Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.",0bd7d087-dce3-4999-81be-759295118e8a
