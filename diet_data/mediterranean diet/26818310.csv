0,introduction0,"Metabolic syndrome (Mets) is a growing public health problem worldwide; including a cluster of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, central obesity, glucose intolerance, hypertension, alterations in several pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factors [1]; Moreover, Mets is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [2]. Several studies have indicated that metabolic syndrome is associated with 3 to 4.3 fold increase in mortality from CVD and 3.5–5 increase in risk of diabetes mellitus (DM) [3]. The outbreak of metabolic syndrome in Iran is too high, pursuant to the Tehran Lipid and Glucose study (Tehran Lipid and Glucose study (TLGS)) in 2003, 42% of women and 24% of men were at risk of metabolic syndrome [4]. However, the current rampancy of metabolic syndrome may be higher up than the former assessment [5].",2d211c28-ccd7-4238-b37f-e6705b1eb0e9
1,introduction1," The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (Adult Treatment Panel (ATP)) III characterized metabolic syndrome as the presence of three or more of the following situations: triglyceride level of at least 150 mg/dl, HDL level less than 40 mg/dl in men and less than 50 mg/dl in women, systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) 130/85 mmHg or upper, fasting blood glucose (fasting blood glucose (FBG)) level 110 mg/dl or upper and waist circumference more than 102 cm in men and more than 88 cm in women [6]. The current explanations of central adiposity are based upon data from western populations; however, numerous studies reported that this cut-off probably requirements to be lowered for Asian populations. Several studied in Iran have reported that a more actual waist circumference for Iranians is > 90 cm for both men and women [7–9].",54141107-2d51-44a9-9d34-b2153cb3d58c
2,introduction2," Therefore, the benefits of effective strategies to control the metabolic syndrome and an understanding of its components should be an important health concern [10].  Therapeutic approaches in metabolic syndrome are multi factorial, including exercise schedules, changing dietary habits and drug therapy [11]. In previous years a meta-analysis study on lifestyle modification and metabolic syndrome indicated that the proportion of people with resolved metabolic syndrome in the intervention group was approximately two fold than control group. The study also indicated that five out of six components of the syndrome decreased significantly in the intervention group compared with the control group [12]; Moreover, numerous reports demonstrated the beneficial role of diet and healthy food choices in prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome [13].",6688ccff-5093-42af-833e-a840020dd9b5
3,introduction3,"  Several studies have explored the efficacy of Mediterranean diet as one of the healthiest dietary patterns to protect chronic disease morbidity, higher life expectancy, and prevention of cardiovascular risks, Type 2 DM and non-alcoholic fatty liver [14]. This pattern is distinguished by a high intake of legumes, nuts, cereals, fruits and vegetables, a higher intake of olive oil with less saturated fats intake, a higher consumption of fish compared with meat and poultry intake, low to moderate dairy products intake and moderate alcohol intake regularly [15]. The beneficial roles of this dietary pattern are mainly attributed to its nutrient and non-nutrient compounds, including fibers, minerals, vitamins and phytochemicals [16].",566d7232-f7d9-47d7-ae94-74a261bd8df0
4,introduction4," Nearly all of the studies concentrated on determining the relations between Mediterranean dietary pattern and risk of disease; consequently, Mediterranean dietary quality index (Med-DQI), which developed by Gerber et al for the first time, is a beneficial tool to assess dietary quality emphasis on two various sources of fat (olive oil and saturated) and two various sources of protein (meat and fish) with reverse scores (Table 1) [17]. Considering the lack of knowledge about the relationship between Mediterranean dietary quality index and metabolic syndrome disease, the first hypothesis of the current study is evaluating the association between ingredients of Med-DQI with anthropometric and biochemical parameters of metabolic syndrome versus healthy group.  10.1371/journal.pone.0171637.t001Table 1 Construction of the score for the Mediterranean Dietary Quality Index.",06ed54e8-a68f-4868-8248-ed225853e70c

8,methods1," This study has been approved by the ethics committee of Tabriz University of Medical Science and Tehran University of Medical Science and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before participation in the study.  Anthropometric assessments Weight was measured with a calibrated scale (SECA, Hamburg, Germany) to the nearest 0.1 kg while subjects were wearing light cloth and without shoes, height using a non-stretchable measurement tape with the precision of 0.1 cm. The body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight (Kg) divided by height squared (m2) [21]. Waist circumference was measured in standing position at the level of the umbilicus, hip circumference (HC) was assessed at the maximum point between the hip and the buttock with a non-elastic tape.  Biochemical assessments After an overnight fasting, all of the subjects underwent a laboratory examination.",232d5ac0-e110-47d9-8868-3a587eeeac77
9,methods2," Venous blood samples were taken from them and approximately 2 cc of the blood was transfused into tubes comprising ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA)) for genetic assays; moreover, sera were extracted from residual blood samples for biochemical assays including fasting serum glucose (fasting serum glucose (FSG)), alanine aminotransferase [22], aspartate aminotransferase [23], total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), adiponectin and matrix metalloproteinase-3(MMP3). Serum AST, ALT, TC, fasting serum glucose (FSG), TG and HDL-C were analyzed by enzymatic colorimetric method (Pars Azmoon, Tehran-Iran), Serum LDL-C was calculated by Friedewald formula [24]. Serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 was also analyzed by ELISA method (Hangzhou Eastbiopharm Co, USA) with sensitivity of 0.01ng/ml and assay range of 0.05–10 ng/ml.",87589718-d7f9-401e-871b-9f0cce7c3c62
10,methods3,"  Dietary intake Usual dietary intake was evaluated using a 147 item semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) which was validated for use in Iranian society [25]. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) consisted of a specified list of standard serving sizes consumed by Iranians popularly. Subjects reported their frequency intake of a given food item during the previous year on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. The foods consumption and portion sizes for every food items were transformed to a daily intake. Then, we calculated the diet score on the basis of Mediterranean diet quality index (Med-DQI) (Table 1). The index allocates a score of 0, 1 or 2 according to the seven components intake and then final score was reported as a summation of all nutrient scores ranged between 0 and 14. A lower score of index denotes better diet quality [17].",83a88ee5-8a02-4e3e-a990-34fd01c2a03a
11,methods4,"  Determination of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) +405 C/G polymorphism genotype High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes by the standard procedures [18]. Polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was employed to determine the +405 vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) C/G (rs2010963) polymorphism status with technical specifications (Fig 1). PCR was performed in a volume of 10 μL including 100 ng DNA, 25 μL Taq PCR master mix RED, 2.5 μL primers and 12.5 μL deionized water. Genomic DNA was amplified in a final volume of 10 μl using the following conditions: denaturation at 95°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1.5 min (annealing) and 72°C for 2 min (extension). A final extension was at 72°C for 10 min.

Moreover, fasting serum glucose (FSG) concentration was significantly higher in metabolic syndrome group. As expected, higher lipid concentrations will be a potent risk factor of cardiovascular events in patients with metabolic syndrome.  Moreover, one of the beneficial approaches in the treatment and prevention of metabolic syndrome is healthy dietary patterns and healthy dietary choices. Also, the relationship between Med-DQI and +405 G/C gene polymorphism, as a novel approach of gene-nutrient interaction has not been previously reported.

Moreover, we observed significantly upper serum LDL and TG concentrations in patients with higher scores of fish, vegetables-fruits and cholesterol, respectively. Studies regarding the direct effect of Mediterranean dietary pattern on metabolic syndrome are rarely; however, several studies reported the protective role of dietary pattern against known risk factors of metabolic syndrome such as obesity [26], insulin resistance [27], hypertension and dyslipidemia [28]. In fact, over the past decades, epidemiological studies have been suggested that nutritional factors has the most important effects against biochemical and anthropometric abnormalities in metabolic syndrome which among them dietary pattern close to the Mediterranean diet demonstrated the most beneficial role [28].",3b43f91e-9cad-4396-a458-0dc77d54019a
21,discussion1," In a sub-analysis of the EPIC study involving a cohort of 497308 subjects, a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with significantly lower values of anthropometric parameters including body mass index (BMI) and WC during three years [29]. In the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort study analyzing 9408 men and women during six years, high adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with prevention of age-related changes in blood pressure [30]. Moreover, in the ATTICA study, adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was contributed to 11.4% better insulin sensitivity, 13% lower concentrations of serum total cholesterol and 3 mmHg lower values of systolic blood pressure in overweight and obese subjects [31].",766ff105-2b1a-44ec-a6f3-5f21e477c28a
22,discussion2," In the study by Williams et al, higher adherence to a dietary pattern similar to Mediterranean diet with high content of fruits and vegetables and high monounsaturated fatty acids was negatively associated to features of metabolic syndrome [32].  The Med-DQI is a beneficial tool for dietary quality assessment and has been validated previously using nutritional biomarkers [17]. This index was based upon the commendations regarding the diet and health of National Research Council and American Heart Association [23]. These commendations are included of intake of less than 30% total energy from fat per day, less than 10% of total energy from saturated fat, less than 30 mg from cholesterol, 55% of energy from complex carbohydrates and more than 5 servings of fruits and vegetables.  According to the scores of Med-DQI, we represented upper serum TG concentrations in patients with metabolic syndrome with high score of cholesterol (P<0.05).",83d2aa98-a100-4805-8225-0c1a0597c515
23,discussion3," Serum triglyceride, rapidly responses to a fatty meal in a dose-dependent manner and its concentrations in serum increases proportional to the dietary fat amount [33]. It has also been reported that baseline serum triglyceride is a vital determinant of its response to a high fat diet; actually, a low-fat diet is associated with lower serum triglyceride concentrations in patients with hard hyper-triglyceridemia [34].  We also observed the beneficial roles of fish and fruit-vegetable components in reducing serum LDL concentrations in patients with metabolic syndrome. The advantageous effects of fish and fruit-vegetable on obesity [21], dislipidemia [35] and insulin resistance [36] had been reported in past [37]. There is a possible mechanism by which dietary fish oil may exert their hypolipidemic action that is reduction of VLDL synthesis in the liver. Fatty acid synthesis in rat liver is reduced by the omega-3 fatty acids of fish oil, which may result in inhibited VLDL synthesis.",d3dafdbc-3541-4efe-88d0-89377ed9eaeb
24,discussion4," It is proposed that a relative block in the conversion of VLDL to LDL was occurred, thus allowing a reduction of LDL [38]. Moreover, the effects of vegetables and fruits on LDL levels contribute to their role in reducing hepatic cellular cholesterol concentration that cause to up-regulation of the LDL receptor, increased hepatic cholesterol uptake and decline in serum levels as observed; also, diet rich in fruits and vegetables are a source of dietary fiber [39]; In this regard, a meta-analysis study indicated LDL reducing effects of dietary fiber [22].  In the current study, higher score of “saturated fatty acid” in CC genotype of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene polymorphisms in patients with metabolic syndrome was also reported. Previous studies indicated a key role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in response against oxidative stress in metabolic syndrome, dislipidemia and insulin resistance.",08c621d4-2ed1-4153-8b36-2c14cb6ee208
25,discussion5," vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) exerts its effects mostly by its antigenic roles that cause to increase permeability and widening of blood vessels [40]; therefore, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may be a therapeutic target for management of oxidative stress in metabolic disorders. The relationship of +405 G/C gene polymorphism of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with essential hypertension and coronary artery diseases in diabetic patients has been reported previously [18, 19]; However, considering the lack of knowledge about the relationship between Mediterranean dietary quality index and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene polymorphism in patients with metabolic syndrome, further interventional studies are needed to evaluate Mediterranean dietary quality index in patients with metabolic syndrome disease according to various genotypes of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) +405 G/C gene polymorphisms.",b1ed76eb-71a1-438e-9757-592e8db48045
26,discussion6,  Conclusion The present study represented a significant relationship between components of Mediterranean dietary pattern and both anthropometric and metabolic risk factors in patients with metabolic syndrome. We also represented a gene-nutrient interaction between CC genotype of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) +405 G/Cgene polymorphisms and dietary saturated fatty acid intakes in metabolic syndrome. It is obvious that dietary modification is the most efficient way to decline chronic disease risk factors [41]. This is the first study evaluating the effect of Mediterranean dietary pattern on anthropometric and metabolic parameters of metabolic syndrome considering the interactive role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene polymorphism; although several limitations of the present study should also be addressed: firstly the case control design of the study has not potential to address cause-effect relationship between variables.,fc41ef15-754f-4850-9858-c02b65e14c93
27,discussion7," Moreover, we did not assess the serum concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the current study due to financial limitations. More studies with interventional designs are needed to better evaluate the effect of Mediterranean dietary pattern on risk factors of metabolic syndrome and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression.
