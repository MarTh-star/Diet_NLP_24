0,methods0," In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA) [13], this manuscript is intended to be accompanied by a systematic review (see Supplemental Table S1: PRISMA 2020 Checklist). The protocol was developed a priori and registered with the National Institute for Health Research’s International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO).). ID: CRD42021246854.  2.1. Search Strategy  For data collection, a systematic search of the literature was conducted using the electronic databases MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until 22 January 2022, with restrictions to Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs). The studies used were published between 2010 and 2021, a date range selected by the current criteria of lag time over the course of a decade, and the articles were confined to those published in the English language. The search strategy was peer-reviewed by R.V.R. and B.M.C.",3a1301b4-79b7-4085-aca3-0d63c5f59539

We utilized tools such as HONselect to define MeSH®, and words and/or their combinations were searched using Bolean operators (e.g., ‘AND’ and ‘OR’).  Examples of search terms included were: (“dietary pattern “OR “diet* pattern” AND (“adult”) in combination with (“biomarker” OR “inflammation” OR “inflammatory”) AND (“diabetes mellitus type 2” OR “type 2 diabetes mellitus”) (see the Supplementary Materials for the list of search terms).  Using the suggested algorithm, we searched with keywords (presented in the title and abstract), combinations and limits were included (humans, adults, and English language) and incorporated into the reference lists, and these articles were also screened.  2.2.",cd3179b5-1378-4f96-bc9d-a1f494a83ea7
2,methods2," Eligibility Criteria  We selected studies in accordance with our pre-specified clinical research question and the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Study Design (Population Intervention Comparator Outcomes Study Design (PICOS)) method. We did not consider minimum requirements for sample size (sensitivity analyses should be carried out accordingly to analyze the sample). Considering the eligibility criteria, if more than one article reported on the outcomes of one study, the longest follow-up period was used. Population Intervention Comparator Outcomes Study Design (PICOS) criteria for inclusion of studies were used to select studies of inclusion: adults with T2DM (≥ 18 years of age) in studies with a priori (i.e.",f6531ed6-ed63-491c-93ac-72f44d179a1d

Studies reporting incomplete data on biomarkers of inflammation were excluded after the corresponding author was contacted for Supplementary Information and could not be retrieved.  2.3.",49a56b13-631d-4928-9b77-8c2e48f7334f
5,methods5," Selection of Studies  Initially, potentially eligible articles were screened by title and abstract; if these were not available or did not give necessary information to obtain scope and purpose, we reviewed concerning inclusion criteria and the full texts of the articles to decide whether to include them.  In the case the record of change from baseline values were unavailable (i.e., studies of a single measure), post-intervention mean values were used as an alternative. Additionally, we considered as part of outcomes of interest (secondary outcomes); measures of glycemic control or monitoring of fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and insulin. Studies including secondary outcomes with blood levels of biomarkers could be eligible. In the case of studies reporting on the progress of a previously implemented intervention, the most recent version of the results was used and the study with the longest periods was included.",14942a2b-bb44-4116-bd74-d2c8e400a82c
6,methods6,"  We defined “DP” with a standard definition used in the field: “DP is traditionally defined as an eating pattern made up of foods and beverages and not as a diet based on macronutrients or nutrients alone” [14]. We also considered including dietary portfolios and eating guidelines as part of a model or guide that is indicative of quantity, variety, combinations, and frequency of various food [15].  Selection process was undertaken by A.I.S.-R. and R.V.-R. Any doubts in the selection and/or decision-making of studies were dissolved by an independent author (B.E.M.-C.).  2.4. Data Extraction  Articles were saved in the Mendeley reference manager software, desktop 1.19.4 (copyright © 2020 Mendeley Ltd, Amsterdam, NL.), and duplicate articles were eliminated manually. When papers did not match the inclusion criteria, the main reason for inclusion was recorded. Afterwards, a list of studies was designed.",51547269-d837-412d-a820-b1bea67cc7c8
7,methods7," We built a database and recorded the following data: year of publication, author(s), study design, main objective, reasons to either include or exclude each article, study sample and size (including mean age, age range, number of women and men in each study, gender proportions, and mean of body mass index), study duration, details of the intervention (location, recruitment) and principal outcomes of interest measured (levels of biomarkers measured with laboratory technique), dietary assessment tools, DP designated by the authors, energy content of diets, descriptions of intervention and control groups, statistical analysis including statistical results, control variables, key findings, main conclusions, important aspects about discussion, ethical declarations, financial and conflict of interest statements, and relevant declarations by the authors (e.g., biases and limitations).",f9772873-1b09-489e-b568-e0f598fd7f48
8,methods8," For studies where required data were not available, the corresponding author was contacted for Supplementary Information. Outcomes between intervention and control groups were clustered by inflammatory biomarkers separately in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [16]: when methodology from studies implicates more than one intervention group gathering inclusion criteria.  Material extraction was conducted by one author (A.I.S.-R.) and presented advances to our group study. Disagreements were discussed to reach a consensus.  2.5. Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias of the Included Studies  We used system Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to assess certainty and their Guideline Development Tool to create a format using Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE)Pro©.",6c35d0d9-3e9c-45f6-96ee-b48f9c636b56
9,methods9," We elaborated summary tables of findings and included Population Intervention Comparator Outcomes Study Design (PICOS) criteria. In the process of downgrading criteria, we scored according to the following: (a) study limitations: risk of bias (publication bias), (b) indirectness, (c) inconsistency (heterogeneity), and (d) imprecision.  Risk of Bias from the studies was assessed by “the risk of bias assessment tool” from the Cochrane Collaboration RoB 2.0. This tool comprises the following designated criteria of bias domain: (a) selection, (b) detection/performance, (c) attrition, and (d) reporting bias. Each bias domain was classified as “low risk”, “high risk”, or “unclear risk”. In the domain selection and performance/detection, we decided to consider studies with double blinding (considered between control and experimental group and personnel) as “low risk”.",62d12068-c5a6-4f39-9228-2067ca7f42cb
10,methods10," To determine the potential risk of publication bias, we constructed funnel plots and their symmetry within mean differences, their standard errors were plotted, and the presence of publication bias was determined.  We applied independent processes to assess Risk of Bias, whereas quality assessment was independently performed by both authors (A.I.S.-R. and R.V.-R.). In the assessment of certainty and Risk of Bias every author was able to review and verify the final decision-making. Discrepancies were resolved in consensus.  2.6. Data Synthesis and Analysis  We conducted data analysis using the statistical measure reported in each study (i.e., means, mean differences, min, quartile 1, median, quartile 3, and max). In the case of studies outcomes, we compared inconsistent results between studies with different cut-off points (e.g., C reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 3 mg/L), which were reported in their unit of measurement.",98077a33-a57c-4f65-9077-4e1d7f6e445d
11,methods11," Data synthesis of all selected studies was identified, and each DP was labeled with key terms (i.e., the country of the study research or the name of the study). Quality synthesis, to compare type of DP involved, type of control diet, and biomarkers, was measured. We grouped for similar characteristics and composition of general DPs: we considered classical approaches with respect to dietary interventions in patients with diabetes.  2.6.1. Meta-Analysis  A meta-analysis was conducted in support of outcome parameters to find out the associated intervention effect between basal and final interventions. We considered mean differences of the DP and control groups; in addition, classification of parameters (pro and anti-inflammatory biomarkers) was required for the analysis, and we decided not to mix biomarkers. If >3 or more articles reported the same biomarker, they were pooled for meta-analysis.",47f15dcb-0a22-4d62-a866-16de5cf97996
12,methods12," We utilized median values and interquartile ranges, and when there was no statistical significative modification between values it was reported, absolute final intervention values were used to improve clinical translation of the pooled estimates. If none of these strategies was successful, methods for an estimated mean of the sample [17,18,19] were used. In the case of standard deviations were not provided (after contacting the authors) estimated standard deviations of the sample [20] were utilized.  The random-effects model was applied to estimate standardized mean differences (standardized mean differences (SMD)) of continuous data. For each study outcome represented in the main analysis, we compared changes between intervention and control diets (longest follow-up mean versus basal mean and their standard deviations). To point out each specific effect size, forest plots were created with a % CI.",bb93b0d2-eff5-4ddc-a262-de075c526264
13,methods13," Effect sizes are presented as standardized mean differences (SMD), 99%CI; findings were considered statistically significant if the 99%CI did not cross the zero-point estimate line and p < 0.01. We backed up the heterogeneity of the outcomes using the I2 test, and we considered levels of 25% to be low, 50% to be moderate, and 75% to be high.  All information was examined on Review Manager software version 5.4.1 by The Cochrane Collaboration©, Copenhagen, Denmark.  2.6.2. Sensitivity Analyses  For modifications in C reactive protein (CRP) (mg/L) between DP and control groups, sensitivity analysis was done. When multiple pro-inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated in the same paper, C reactive protein (CRP) was prioritized for its function as a traditional inflammatory biomarker, and we implemented converting between high- and low-sensitivity C reactive protein (CRP) that allows comparisons calculated by formula (full details have been published elsewhere [21,22]).",c7bfbaa1-d941-4257-ae78-32ed2ab34adc
14,methods14," We established in the PROSPERO protocol registration, a subgroup analyses guided by kind of DP, we hypothesized that a subgroup of DP with similar characteristics obtain different results.  Univariate meta-regression analyses were not performed as procedures require at least ten studies (studies had insufficient information).  3. Results  3.1. Description of the Included Studies  Our literature search found 842 references from a systematic search of electronic databases, of which 47 full-text-available studies were retrieved and screened for eligibility as part of the selection process (Figure 1).",de81cf64-7253-4788-99c2-bd4a6b1e0d64
15,methods15," After reviewing the full texts of 19 articles, nine were eliminated because they did not meet the inclusion criteria; one study was duplicate study population [23]; two studies had ineligible study design, and they were excluded because they reported the outcome for adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) as a binary variable (adherence or not adherence) without quantitative biomarkers [24,25]; two studies were part of a macro-project, and we used the eligible study version with the longest duration period [26,27]; one study compared lifestyle interventions with the use of insulin as medication [28]; one study showed incomplete monitoring assessment (no final values were presented, only basal values) [29]; one was a pilot study [30]; another was excluded due to a lack of data about biomarkers which we could not obtain even after contacting the authors (only mentioned their evaluation but did not report it) [31].",7f167581-34df-4848-834a-32c614bd5f27
16,methods16," Finally, a total of 10 clinical trials [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41] met the inclusion criteria and were included in our systematic review.  The articles analyzed in this review were published between 2011 and 2018. The study countries were the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Australia, the USA, Mexico, Israel, Iran, and Sweden. Studies were RCTs with a duration of up to 8.1 years and enrolled a total of 2992 subjects. The number of patients by gender was male, 1430 (47.80%), and female, 1562 (52.20%).  We found the following healthy DPs: Diabetes UK healthy eating guidelines [35], American Heart Association´s Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet [38], Anti-inflammatory dietary portfolio [40], Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet) [39], The Diabetes Prevention Program (Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)) [26], and the Mediterranean Diet (MD) [32,33,34,37,41].",18e01631-a87b-402a-9324-d116248a4ab4
17,methods17," The control diet was a low-fat diet [32,33,34,37,41], habitual diet [35], or prescribed diet [36,38,39,40]. An overview of publications included in the systematic review is shown in Table 1.  3.2. Risk of Bias of Included Studies and Quality of Evidence  Assessment of Risk of Bias was evaluated in the studies, and objective rating (i.e., low risk”, “high risk”, or “unclear risk) was assigned to each publication by type of domain. Studies with the most positive criteria were PREDIMED (five domains obtained “low risk” of eight criteria) [34] and LOOK AHEAD study (six domains obtained “low risk” of eight criteria) [36], rating of bias domains for every study is presented in Figure 2.  Other biases we found in the studies were (i) statistical analyses, (ii) conflicts of interest, (iii) follow-up, (iv) equilibrium in the arms, (v) enrollment, and (vi) study design/treatment (see Supplementary Material Table S10. The “Risk of Bias” tool).",833a403e-4951-4cb1-b52f-46902a1c373e
18,methods18," The type of bias was evaluated of the 10 studies included 100% had a low risk in random sequence generation, 75% had low risk in allocation concealment. Around 25% of studies used blinding of participants and personnel, and just half blinded the outcome assessment (Figure 3).  Funnel plots were generated for outcome measures provided by five different trials [32,33,34,35,36,37] for adiponectin and seven studies for C reactive protein (CRP) [32,33,34,35,36,37,38] Adiponectin´s plot showed little to moderate asymmetry, indicating that publication bias cannot be entirely excluded as an aspect that impacted the present meta-analysis (see Supplementary Materials Figure S1; Funnel plot of comparison: final values, outcome).",3ae32ce4-e4c8-402e-b09a-c090cfe15b75
19,methods19," C reactive protein (CRP)´s plot shows little asymmetry; nevertheless, an explanation for this could be those small studies providing inconclusive or unsuccessfully data have not been published (see Supplementary Materials Figure S2; Funnel plot of comparison: final values, outcome).  Certainty and quality of evidence were rated, adiponectin obtained a low certainty and C reactive protein (CRP) a moderate certainty (Table 2).  3.3. Primary Outcomes: Inflammatory Biomarkers and Dietary Patterns  All studies reported at least one parameter using the following biomarkers of inflammation: TNF-α [34], IL-6 [34,35,37], visfatin [34], resistin [34,38], E-selectin [38], lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [40], leptin [34,41] VCAM-1 [38], and ICAM-1 [34,35,38].

20,methods20," [34] found that IL-6 and ICAM-1 levels were statistically significantly decreased, and adiponectin levels were statistically significantly increased in most trial years duration, while in the control diet, there was no significative changes (Table 1 Summary of studies included). In the Look AHEAD study [36], they found that the experimental group showed significant improvements. Adiponectin increased significantly with the experimental diet compared with controls in both men and women, and decreases in C reactive protein (CRP) (−43,6%, p < 0.001) were also observed. Fernemark et al. [41], in which leptin levels decreased. In the ACTivity In Diabetes (ACTID) study [35] after 12 months, mean of C reactive protein (CRP) levels were substantially attenuated; with a reduction of relative risk of 0.72 (0.55–0.95).",d6bbe221-aa38-43c5-b8f6-18c46e560c8e
21,methods21,"  We clustered studies by results and similar features, which were summarized according to biomarkers of inflammation (adiponectin, IL-6, C reactive protein (CRP), leptin, and I-CAM) utilized more in RCTs, and we grouped each DP. Qualitative synthesis is presented in Table 3. The cluster “Cardio Protective” included recommendations by the American Heart Association and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [42]. The cluster “Specialized diet for subjects with diabetes” included Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the Diabetes UK healthy eating guidelines [43].  The DP most used was the MD [32,33,34,37,41], and we described and compared the food composition of different styles of MD among studies (see Supplementary Materials, Table S11.

In the MEDITA trial [32] using MD, changes in the HOMA-IR (3.3 ± 1.2, p = 0.01) were reported; in the PREDIMED study [34] fasting glucose in MD was –4.2 (37.3) mg/dL, p < 0.001; and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [39] reported, in the final intervention, levels of fasting glucose of −13.9 ± 4.5 mg/dL, p < 0.05.

The analysis for the other subgroups is presented in the Supplementary Materials (see Supplemental Table S1).  4. Discussion  The aim of this study was to identify RCTs on inflammation and DPs in T2DM by considering different approaches and by summarizing evidence via a meta-analysis. To our knowledge, this is a pioneer systematic review on the topic; previous systematic reviews have centered exclusively on glycemic control and a priori [44] or exploratory DPs [45] or did not separately focus on different dietary approaches to explore DPs and thus to summarize the evidence in T2DM and balance of inflammatory processes [46,47,48,49,50,51].  4.1.",7588c856-72af-4c32-8d2c-9cc08b7c89cb
26,methods26," Summary Findings  In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found six different healthy DPs, and their effect on eleven parameters of inflammation. In the systematic review, we evaluated ten RCTs, and we analyze, in our linear meta-analysis, the changes in values of C reactive protein (CRP) and adiponectin from eight studies.  4.2. Hypothesis/Reasons of Our Findings  The analysis of RCTs included in our study supports the theory that DPs could impact on biomarkers of inflammation and, therefore, values of glycemic control. Food composition of the DPs and duration of the interventions could be reasons for these effects [52,53].  We think that the outcomes in our study could be explained by basal measurements of control glycemic. A systematic literature review suggests that it is necessary to focus on the initial state of glycemic control [54].",e7f470a2-e3ec-46e0-8fa2-de055b345993
27,methods27," With respect to glucose and according to the values of glycemic control of the American Diabetes Association (American Diabetes Association (ADA)) [55], only one study had participants with adequate glycemic control in basal measurements [37]. Concerning glycemic control in experimental groups, seven studies [32,34,35,36,37,39,40] demonstrated beneficial changes in values after experimental DPs. In the PREDIMED study [34], a favorable change in fasting glucose was observed (compared versus control group −3.6 mg/L, p < 0.01), which is remarkable because in the intervention of PREDIMED study, participants received intensive education to follow MD with recommendations and quantitative aspects. Additionally, also with MD, Itsiopoulos et al. [37] observed clinically and statistically significant falls in HbA1c, which reinforced the idea that MD provides benefits on glycemic control.",5d8f946c-05dd-4881-8c39-70b248350161
28,methods28," The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [39] also reported, in the final intervention, lower levels of fasting glucose (−13.9 (4.5) mg/dL, p < 0.05), in a period of eight weeks. In this same period, Sauder et al. [42] found that there were no differences in values of glycemic control after an experimental diet. Furthermore, in the Look AHEAD study [36], Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) showed a 0.7% drop in A1C, resulting in a 43.6% decrease in median hs-C reactive protein (CRP). The improvement in glycemic control achieved with Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was also in one year. This evidence showed according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) goals [56].  In our study, we found that healthy DPs focus mainly on the consumption of unsaturated fatty acids, whole grains, and high amounts of antioxidants and phytochemicals, in contrast with two studies included in the study [36,39] which mainly focus on glycemic index with low-carbohydrate content.",e069af41-70ec-46a1-a14b-90cd0c7852ce
29,methods29," Furthermore, based on our analyses which may influence the DPs studied and their classification, some authors proposed that the traditional treatment for patients with T2DM is a low-carbohydrate diet [50], although we found four studies that evaluated the low-fat diet as control diet [32,33,34,41]. A meta-analysis assessing the effect of different diets on markers of inflammation in patients with metabolic syndrome described a positive effect of low-fat diets on the reduction in C reactive protein (CRP) [57]. In contrast, Itsiopoulos et al. [37] administered a habitual diet in participants with adequate glycemic control. Sauder et al. [38] defined the same type of diet between groups; however, they added a functional component.",ba2788fe-303e-494e-9552-6d582a1a18a0
30,methods30," Indeed, it is important to suggest an experimental diet that considers nutritional content (proportion of carbohydrates, protein, and type of fat) because inflammation plays a key role at all stages of the disease, based on pathogenesis and modifying related inflammatory pathways, as the visceral fat is directly associated with the production of pro-inflammatory mediators [58]. The principal fat in the studies was provided by mono-unsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids, with restrictions in saturated fatty acids. Additionally, weight loss can reduce several pro-inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, and TNF-α [59], and, in general, the glycemic state with the improvement of inflammation markers [25]. In the Look AHEAD study [36], a significant weight loss and improvement in levels of C reactive protein (CRP) (−1.24, p < 0.",4e4265fd-4b77-4ee2-a73f-d4827dafe4f2
31,methods31,"001) were reported, while the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [42] showed that a calculation of individual energy requirements could improve C reactive protein (CRP) levels (−2.04, p = 0.02). An experimental diet should be established in the studies of DPs in accordance with type of fat, weight loss, and type of control diet in T2DM (subgroups of low-fat versus low-carbohydrate diet) populations to represent a real-life clinical practice.  Some doses and components of healthy DPs are still controversial, and the exact doses of some compounds for T2DM are unknown. In our Systematic Review, we observed doses and amounts, and only dietary recommendations to achieve a DP. For example, the amount of alcohol is controversial. The Direct Trial [33] did not include it, and the other MD styles recommended moderate consumption of red wine [32,34,37,41].",48a0c1a5-2a97-4935-814e-07bb3f985306
32,methods32," The Dietary Inflammation Index has proposed it as an anti-inflammatory compound [60]; however, the World Health Organization disapproves of any consumption of alcohol [61].  It seems that the results of the studies indicate that dietary health recommendations also could be useful. A systematic review that provided information about dose–response reported that when applying only healthy dietary recommendations, statistically significant associations between MD and C reactive protein (CRP) were found; in contrast, when utilizing a structured diet and an olive oil diet, no associations with inflammatory markers were observed [62]. We also explored similar characteristics in an experimental diet, in which various amounts and doses modified the structure of the regimen and contributed to variations; however, the same DP outcomes resulted. For example, we found different compositions of MD in the studies.",23141e9c-09d7-4d74-b2d1-2efe936ae607
33,methods33," MD was used in five RCTs, some studies coming from the Mediterranean region [32,33,34] and others with different geographical locations [37,41]. Mainly, the characteristic foods of the MD that would benefit the degree of inflammation were used; we found that the usual diet of European populations, principally in Mediterranean countries, tends to include the consumption of seafood, vegetables, and fruits, whereas American populations mostly adhere to whole cereals, legumes, and white meat containing different loads of inflammatory foods [63].  To our knowledge, evidence suggests that components of healthy DPs stimulate anti-inflammatory actions [64] and could possibly be a practical treatment for T2DM [65]; however, based on the findings of similar studies [66], avenues for future research included doses and components of healthy DPs [67].",e14a338e-9782-4c3e-a3cc-4caf8738a669
34,methods34,"  In line with the hypothesis, the duration of interventions could be impact in the results and mostly should be > six months to observe favorable changes in T2DM [68]. In our study, we found that the duration of the interventions was, on average, mostly one year. We believe that the DPs that we analyzed in our study may be effective dietary strategies for stimulating anti-inflammatory actions in T2DM that are used as a primary intervention in long-term consumption [69,70].  Outcomes could be affected by a high heterogeneity in the studies evaluated. In the present study, the data suggest that the I2 measure of heterogeneity increased with broadening regions and multicenter studies. The DPs are also a reflection of habits and environment [71]; we hypothesized that location also could interfere with our results. It is beyond the scope of this study, and necessary results may further support research into the application of healthy DPs for individuals with T2DM.  4.3.",f20285ad-86f8-4659-ade3-9e3977fc0e03
35,methods35," Similar Outcomes  The results of the Meta-analysis indicate that favorable changes in biomarkers of inflammation could be participate in the balance of inflammation. C reactive protein (CRP) a pro-inflammatory biomarker showed the pooled effect of experimental diet to reduce statistically significant levels of C reactive protein (CRP) (−0.83, −1.49 to −0.17), and adiponectin an anti-inflammatory biomarker showed the pooled effect of experimental diet to reduce statistically significant levels of adiponectin (0.81, 0.06 to 1.56). Similar evidence was found in a meta-analysis of 17 RCTs including 2300 subjects, supporting evidence that both C reactive protein (CRP) and adiponectin levels were favorably affected following interventions with healthy DPs [72]. Contrary to the main analysis, in our sub-group analysis by a kind of DP, we found a significant increase in adiponectin levels (0.88, 0.14 to 1.62), but no significant decrease in C reactive protein (CRP) (−1.37 to 0.64).",72ee69a7-c24c-421f-a832-854254cf34f9
36,methods36," Due to the lack of number of studies, interpreting this should be considered exploratory, and the results cannot confirm if C reactive protein (CRP) did not show lower levels using MD; one possible explanation is elevated inter- and intra-methodological variability among the studies even if was utilized the same control and experimental diet.  A profile of biomarkers to describe the process of chronic inflammation is still quite inconsistent, as we, do not currently know which cut-off points are for a specific population or which to use and this could be helpful to establish an inflammatory state in individuals.  We know that only two biomarkers are insufficient to describe the inflammation process; however, we found that C reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin, IL-6, ICAM-1, and TNF- could be integrated into this profile, in accordance with the results in the previous a systematic literature reviews [73,74].",3d74abce-f3d3-48bf-a7da-499e6c8c4569
37,methods37," In our quality synthesis, we found the presence of TNF-α [34], IL-6 [34,35,37], visfatin [34], resistin [34,38], E-selectin [38], lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [40], leptin [34,41] VCAM-1 [38], and ICAM-1 [34,35,38] among the studies; nevertheless, we could not include all of them in our meta-analysis due to lack of data and number of studies for comparison.  4.4. Implications for Further Research  There are diverse DPs implemented in the T2DM population with the purpose of modulating chronic inflammation. In a 2013 position statement, the American Diabetes Association suggested five eating patterns for the management of diabetes: MD, low-fat, low-carbohydrate, vegetarian and vegan, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) [56]. The results of this review provide more evidence about any DPs that may help decrease low-grade inflammation.",a5c81ef4-350a-4ccf-aa25-3111023520f7
38,methods38," We compared different characteristics of foods shared in MD, which could explain the total effect of interventions as most of the associations in the studies were linked with C reactive protein (CRP); this also is supported in a systematic literature review of epidemiological studies [75]. There was an inverse association relating inflammatory biomarkers to vegetables, whole grains, fish, and fruits based on a priori healthy DP, particularly with C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Furthermore, it is well known that “high-quality carbohydrates” in the diet lead to a higher intake of antioxidants, magnesium, and fiber, which are linked to positive associations with adiponectin [76]. Some studies also supported this; for example, a systematic literature review concluded that MD and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets were associated with a decrease in inflammatory markers [77]; this is in accordance with studies included in our review of healthy DPs as well.",df52ee46-3714-46f7-a495-d68673936e93
39,methods39," In contrast, a very recent meta-analysis and review of RCTs in various chronic diseases concluded that the MD, but not the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, reduced IL-1b, IL-6, and C reactive protein (CRP) [59]. In our meta-analysis, we found similar outcomes, which could explain the total effect of interventions, as most of the negative associations in the studies were linked with C reactive protein (CRP) and positive associations with adiponectin [78].  Further investigations should involve large trials that measure all these DPs in subjects with T2DM with similar characteristics and appropriate follow-up with the same control diet (e.g., habitual diet). Additionally, further research should aim to guarantee a similar DP intake.",f48c8060-ec06-4548-a16e-0a8b655b464e
40,methods40," Approaches between insulin sensitivity and immunomodulatory effects of each dietary regimen or DP would be another area to explore; for example, we found that MD is a DP with effects in glucose and insulin levels and favorable changes in PCR and adiponectin levels. Additional research should also try to include several pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in the progress of T2DM. The profile of the pro-inflammatory status in T2DM and its nutritional treatment is still a field of opportunity. In clinical practice, there are many advantages when DPs are individualized to a particular region because they are easier to implement in everyday life.  4.5. Strengths and Limitations  The major study strengths rely on utilizing only RCTs. Studies were selected following a scrutiny process with well-defined inclusion criteria; furthermore, we used methods standardized for the recollection of nutritional, clinical, and biomarker information.",4d3b9c68-1538-45fe-a74c-bfffcb233042
41,methods41," Although there is no standard definition for the MD and recommendations are based on populations, we found overlapping elements to analyze.  Among the study limitations, we acknowledge that we gathered information on intermediate endpoints as secondary outcomes in the studies. Deserving consideration is the lack of standardization of inflammatory outcomes in research, this limited comparison between studies makes analysis difficult, which means adequate comparisons cannot be made in meta-analyses. Additionally, we could not include some biomarkers in our meta-analyses.  Another study limitation is that we observed a high heterogeneity. We believe the main reasons were the variety of foods in the DPs analyzed, thereby potentially affecting the effects of the meta-analysis. This could be related to the wide variability in results from data collection and analysis in the various RCTs, which are not uniformly adjusted.  5.",e2ca7d16-58fd-46ab-a060-60eb35a72c53
42,methods42," Conclusions  This review reveals that, due to study characteristics and types of DPs, including quantitative variables and small size of this review along with disagreements across studies, it is difficult to generalize and make further conclusions.  We concluded that low- to moderate-quality evidence from RCTs suggests that healthy DPs were associated with favorable changes; the pool estimates of all studies combined were associated with a significant reduction in C reactive protein (CRP), while plasma levels of adiponectin were significant higher, both of which indicate less inflammation. The findings from this study provide evidence to support the implementation of DPs for assisting in the better management of chronic inflammation in subjects with T2DM.  In the current context, intervention studies provide evidence to study DPs, and it is necessary to undertake studies that reflect usual dietary intake. Clinical trials are consequently required using the same control diet.",06257ede-6008-47d2-b6de-86f4323b0570
43,methods43,"  We propose to continue exploring healthy DPs and their effect on inflammatory biomarkers to evaluate changes over time in T2DM as prognostic risk factors, which should be included as part of the nutritional monitoring. ",c45209cd-83fb-4555-a061-8ada544795e6
