Ethics Statement  All the patients were enrolled after fulfilling the informed consent. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics committee (Campus Prot. 24/15 PAR ComEt CBM).  2.2. Study Population  Since there is no clear evidence in the literature on the underlying mechanisms governing the interactions between dietary patterns, gut microbiota and GI symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), it was not possible to calculate a sample size for the present pilot study.",72a9e784-9d63-454e-b381-d1b72f54cd61

All patients completed a symptoms questionnaire, elaborated on the Rome IV criteria, in which the GI symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain and flatulence) were evaluated with a Numeric Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11) [32] for patient self-reporting of pain intensity (0 = no pain, 1–3 = mild pain, 4–6 = moderate pain, and 7–10 = severe pain).  The patients reported all bowel movements in a daily diary for 3 days, based on the Bristol Stool Form scale [33,34]. Based on these details, the stool consistency (average stool consistency/day) and stool frequency (average number of stools/day) were calculated.  Weight and height were measured using standardized techniques by trained clinical staff. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm and weight to the nearest 10 g using digital column scales (SECA, Hannover, MD, USA).",cd1e7518-2b7c-44c2-b906-25baed02366a

[39] was used to assess the Mediterranean Diet (MD) adherence degree based on the frequency of consumption of foods and food groups. It is based on Mediterranean Diet Pyramid [40], using the recommended consumption frequency of different foods and food groups that should be consumed in every meal (olive oil, cereals, vegetables and fruits), daily (nuts and dairy products), and weekly (fish, white meat, red meat, eggs, legumes, potatoes and sweets). Subjects whose intake of foods and food groups was within the recommended number of servings were assigned a score of 3, 2, or 1 point for recommendations expressed in times/meal, times/day, or times/week, respectively. A score of 0 was assigned when the number of servings was higher or lower than recommended.",29383df0-e133-44f4-8eec-5ac7b6ed36c6

Discussion  The present study aimed to investigate the current dietary characteristics, adherence to the MD and the daily intake of macronutrients in an adult study group with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), compared to controls, in order to evaluate the adequacy of the diet. Moreover the intensity level of GI symptoms and gut microbiota alterations were explored in these patients, grouped according to the reference intake ranges (RIs) for macronutrients.",fc8f9d2f-bed3-4459-b051-883706194e36
25,methods25," In accordance with European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) dietary reference values [47] and Società Italiana di Nutrizione Umana (SINU) guidelines [38], the RIs for macronutrients, expressed as % of energy intake, indicate the amount of a single nutrient that people need to maintain good health depending on their age and gender and associated with a low risk of chronic diseases. Using these recommendations to evaluate the level of nutrients intake and the adequacy of their usual diet, the majority of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients exhibited a significant difference for total lipids consumption (68% irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) vs. 24% controls), outside RI, compared to the control group, mainly linked to a significant limited consumption of fish, seafood and nuts reported in the present study.",5150d34f-0bf3-4a79-8591-cb92789e53a7
26,methods26," These results are in accordance with previous findings [21,48,49,50] in which most of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients showed a trend of displacement in energy and nutrients intake compared with an age- and gender-matched control group. The inadequacy of the diet, with intakes above (or below) the lower and upper limits of the acceptable range of each macronutrient, is supported by the results obtained for MD-adherence, which was significantly lower in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients than in controls. Non-compliance with some recommendations of MD-dietary patterns frequency intake, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish and seafood, milk and dairy products, desserts (sugar, pastes, sugary drinks, etc.) and walnuts was detected, although not fully supported by a statistical analyses difference.",6f93aba8-121e-4319-a16f-055082eea82d
27,methods27," These findings could be explained by the fact that many of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients report that their symptoms are triggered by specific foods–most commonly implicated milk and milk products, wheat products, some fruits and vegetables, cabbage, onion, peas/beans, caffeine, certain meat, hot spices, fried food and smoked products–limiting or excluding them from their usual diet [20,51]. Many of these foods contain a number of fermentable carbohydrates with prebiotic effects [17], such as inulin-type fructans (fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin, oligofructose) and galacto-oligosaccharides (galacto oligosaccharides (GOS)), which are generally poorly absorbed in the small intestine and fermented by gut saccharolytic bacteria, causing gas production, distension of the large intestine with abdominal discomfort or pain [20,23].",e03a7b7d-387f-4a5b-bf7e-627817e5f6a7
28,methods28," However, it is not clear whether they are really the cause of this disease, but their restriction might lead to specific changes in the composition and/or activity of gut microbiota and a reduction in SCFAs-producing bacteria [17,24,25,27], with possible adverse effects on GI symptoms. Furthermore, it is known that a high-fat diet (high fat diets (HFD)), such as Western diet (WD), has been strongly related to changes in the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota of a WD is characterized by a significant reduction in microbial diversity, species richness and a significant reduction of bacterial species producing SCFAs [26,52]. Therefore these alterations could contribute to the processes of low-grade inflammation in patients with several functional GI disorders [53,54].",6237e46f-823a-4db9-9a0a-358836b601ff
29,methods29,"  Although no statistical differences were observed for both α- and β-diversity parameters, it is interesting to note that specific bacterial biomarkers were associated to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients with an altered diet. In particular, Lactobacillaceae and Lactobacillus seemed to be associated to an inadequate consumption of carbohydrates; Erysipelotrichaceae of the phylum Firmicutes were linked to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with non-MNs profile, compared to control MNs group. An increase of Lactobacillus genus has been correlated with high production of L- and D-lactate when the carbohydrates of the diet are in excess and are not completely absorbed [55,56].",3749ef09-19e1-40a2-9fac-8a5b30d3047e
30,methods30," In this scenario, an abnormal production of lactate and pH acidification of the colon causes a greater proliferation of bacteria responsible for lactic acid synthesis, mainly Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus acidophilus [57] that, however, also have mucolytic activity, altering the epithelial intestinal barrier. Interestingly, in a study conducted in cats, class Erysipelotrichi and genus Lactobacillus were increased in feces from cats with chronic diarrhea [58], suggesting their potential involvement in the intestinal functional impairment. Moreover, our data agree with multiple targeted metagenomics analyses in which the abundance of Erysipelotrichi is strongly associated with a WD and after high fat diets (HFD) treatment [59,60].",b14f160b-da69-45cc-b0e5-651a44aecb4a
31,methods31," In this context, it has been hypothesized that a diet not adequately distributed in the daily intake of carbohydrates, fats and proteins could produce a direct effect on some specific taxa recognized to be closely correlated to adiposity, colorectal cancer and interleukin (IL)-1β levels [61,62], possibly promoting a pro-inflammatory intestinal state that could alter intestinal permeability in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients.  By investigating the gut microbiota of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients with a balanced intake of macronutrients, specific taxonomic biomarkers were associated to the group with adequate RI for lipid, such as Adlercreutzia, and Rikenellaceae; while in the group within RI for carbohydrate consumption Mogibacteriaceae, Parabacteroides and F. prausnitzii were detected.",aa72c8ad-f132-46d5-8fdc-ffe207b6492e
32,methods32," A study conducted on healthy adults showed that Mogibacteriaceae and Rikenellaceae were positively correlated with a high frequency of bowel movements [63], suggesting that in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-C patients, the frequency of bowel movements could be controlled by modulating the abundance of Mogibacteriaceae and Rikenellaceae through a balanced diet that satisfies the dietary recommendations for carbohydrate and fat intake.  F. prausnitzii is one of the most abundant anaerobic bacterial species that is becoming recognized as an important marker for gastrointestinal health and important for the maintenance of gastrointestinal health [64]. Moreover, it is able to metabolize complex carbohydrates from the diet producing butyrate, which represents an important source of energy for colonocytes and prevents the invasion of pathogens by strengthening the intestinal barrier. Butyrate also participates in immune modulation reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g.",34e7f143-0539-4687-847c-33f701daf30d
33,methods33,", IL-8, interferon [INF]-γ and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α) and stimulating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10 and IL-12) generally decreased in patients with a WD and a reduction of dietary fibers [65,66]. These anti-inflammatory properties can protect the colon from the inflammatory processes, and a significant loss of F. prausnitzii has been associated with a change in the microbiota of patients with different chronic GI disorders [67,68]. Therefore, most irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients could (and should) follow a balanced diet with a well-balanced intake of macronutrients, without restrictions and/or excesses, and without concentrating the intake of fermentable sugars in a meal or in a limited period.",be1c3edc-7dda-415e-a0d5-1be9250744fa
34,methods34," The modulation of the gut microbiota, through an adequate intake of prebiotics and dietary fiber, could significantly increases the abundance of beneficial commensals, improving the GI symptoms severity and the intestinal function in subjects with several intestinal disorders. These results were already reported for healthy subjects that followed the consumption of prebiotics (inulin 10 g/day) or dietary fibers (21 g/day) [69,70].  Moreover, the LEfSe analysis in the present study has identified some taxa strictly associated to healthy subjects. For instance, V. dispar was linked to the la Popolazione Italiana (LARN) group of fats and carbohydrate consumption and R. gnavus to both MNs-group and la Popolazione Italiana (LARN) group of carbohydrate. Interestingly, R. gnavus is known to produce an antibacterial peptides and SCFAs [71], both with protective effects in the host from the pathogens.",14aedfce-4478-4a98-b1f0-de594569cb75
35,methods35," Bacteroides, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides caccae were increased both in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and controls group with an adequate % energy of lipid and protein intake. Bacteroides spp. are considered important bacteria in maintaining intestinal health, because they strengthen the epithelial barrier and produce anti-inflammatory molecules such as polysaccharide A (polysaccharide A (PSA)), sphingolipids and outer membrane vesicles (outer membrane vesicles (OMV)) [72,73]. In a recent study, it was observed that B. caccae, B. intestinalis and B. vulgatus significantly reduced IL-8 levels in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced enterocyte cell line, demonstrating their in vitro ability to attenuate inflammation [74]. In addition, B. fragilis has been shown to relieve lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in mouse models by decreasing TNF-α, increasing IL-10 cytokines and restoring the Treg/Th17 balance [75,76].",a9192af9-1e8a-44f9-9a33-7da26ee55715
36,methods36," Further investigations are needed to evaluate the safety of Bacteroidetes spp., because of some strains are also considered opportunistic pathogens which may induce the pro-inflammatory processes and play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic GI diseases [77,78].  5. Strengths and Limitations of the Study  According to the current knowledge, this is one of the first studies aiming to explore the possible associations of MD adherence and macronutrient intake with the gut microbiota profile and GI symptoms prevalent in adult irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. The results of the present investigations note that lower severity of GI symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) group, such as flatulence and abdominal pain, appeared to be associated with higher MD adherence, compared to those who had a poor level of adherence to MD recommendations.",f2ae6165-4b8a-4410-9e73-ac5aa7424b8d
37,methods37," In addition, the subdivision of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and controls by la Popolazione Italiana (LARN) and non-la Popolazione Italiana (LARN) groups showed a significant difference in total dietary fat intake, demonstrating a higher prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients in not satisfy the RI for lipid.  Certainly, the reported results should be considered in light of some limitations: (1) this study is based on a modest size cohort and requires a more significant number of patients, in further investigations, to corroborate these preliminary data; (2) there was a loss of three fecal samples because no sequences were obtained during the analysis; (3) it was not possible to carry out comparative analysis relating to dietary fiber intake as both groups had a negligible average daily intake; (4) the study population is biased towards females, this may have led to bias,",6c56527c-85a6-46b3-9af6-67a79a1c58ec
38,methods38," but is a direct representation of the demographic characteristics of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients to whom our department refers; (5) the 454 platform for microbiota pyrosequencing used in this study, results currently overcome by more performing technologies. However, during the developing of this project the 454 platform was widely used in microbiota studies. The limited patient size allows only a first description of the relationship between diet, fecal microbiota and GI symptoms, but the sample size and the fact that this is a case-control study preclude definitive identification of the causal link. At the same time, the preliminary conclusions of this study invite further exploration of these aspects in future research, with a larger patient’s number.  6. Conclusions  In conclusion, the underlying mechanisms governing the interaction between dietary patterns, gut microbiota diversity and the host are still unclear in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).",eead2ba1-38ff-438c-a5a3-a67898e3a483
39,methods39," The available data on the MD, GI symptoms and modulation of the gut microbial structure in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients are rather scarce. Based on the present investigation, the adherence to MD recommendations is associated with a lower risk of severe GI symptoms. Furthermore, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients who met macronutrient RIs were characterized by increased colonization patterns of SCFA-producing bacteria, such as F. prausnitzii and Rikenellaceae. Certainly, the influence of the MD on gut microbial ecology is a scientific field open to further investigation to understand the safety and efficacy of a MD-based dietary strategy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous entity and the growing knowledge of its pathophysiology supports the potential of dietary therapies to modulate the intestinal microbiota, not only to improve symptoms.",5ee391bc-8b33-4ce5-93c6-410804ed850d
40,methods40," More accurate personalized prediction methods need to be developed by combining basic microbiome signatures with other important clinical traits, such as GI symptoms. Therefore, understanding the variations and fluctuations in microbiota profiles and concentrations of host or microbial derived metabolites, could be used to infer the processes that contribute to symptoms onset and severity of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), providing important new insights on the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
