Full-scan MS data were set to 100–1500 m/z and MS/MS experiments were conducted in the data-dependent acquisition process. Interface and curved desolvation line temperatures were set to 250 °C while nebulizing and drying gases (N2) were fixed at 1.5 and 10 L/min, respectively. For the prediction of the molecular formula, Formula Predictor software (Shimadzu) was used with the following settings: maximum deviation from mass accuracy of 10 ppm, fragment ion information, and nitrogen rule. The identification of compounds was based on accurate MS and MS/MS spectra, the retention times of available standards, and comparisons with the literature. Moreover, the following free online databases were consulted: ChemSpider (http://www.chemspider.com, accessed on 23 Januray 2022), SciFinder Scholar (https://scifinder.cas.org, accessed on 23 Januray 2022), and Phenol-Explorer (www.",2a14111a-d830-417e-89bd-b10ea932dac9

For δ13C, the samples were analyzed using a single working standard for normalization and calibrated against NBS-22 fuel oil (IAEA-International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria), IAEA-CH-6 sucrose, and USGS 40 (U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, VA, USA).",782a5858-57d6-43ae-bf82-f7a65c4f71ae
11,methods12," We did not use a calibration curve for δ13C as suggested by IUPAC [32] because as we used a single standard with a value similar to that of the samples. The data determined using a single anchoring point or two or three anchoring points were not significantly different [33]. The δ2H and δ18O values of defatted protein were calculated against USGS 84 (Sicilian olive oil standard δ2H = −140.4 ± 3.1 ‰ and δ18O = +26.38 ± 0.5‰) and USGS 86 (tropical Vietnamese peanut oil standard, δ2H = −207.4 ± 4.5‰ and δ18O = +18.76 ± 1.03‰) through the creation of a linear equation and adoption of the “comparative equilibration procedure” [34]. One control sample was routinely included in each analytical run to check the system performance and we obtained very repeatable results over the 2 month running period. Measurement uncertainty rates, expressed as one standard deviation when measuring a sample 10 times, were ≤2‰ for δ2H, 0.3‰ for δ18O, and 0.2‰ for δ13C.  2.13.",06ba3c10-75a2-4901-a597-9d8612a944a9

20,methods21," Preparation of Rat Aortic Rings  The thoracic aorta was gently cleaned of adipose and connective tissues and cut into 3-mm-wide rings. These were mounted in organ baths between two parallel L-shaped stainless steel hooks, one fixed in place and the other connected to an isometric transducer [39]. Rings were allowed to equilibrate for 60 min in KHS (composition in mM: 118 NaCl, 4.75 KCl, 1.19 KH2PO4, 1.19 MgSO4, 25 NaHCO3, 11.5 glucose, 2.5 CaCl2, gassed with a 95% O2–5% CO2 gas mixture to create a pH of 7.4) under a passive tension of 1 g. During this equilibration period, the solution was changed every 15 min. The isometric tension was recorded using a digital PowerLab data acquisition system (PowerLab 8/30; ADInstruments). Ring viability was assessed by recording the response to 0.3 µM phenylephrine (Sigma Chimica, Milan, Italy) and 60 mM KCl. Where needed, the endothelium was removed by gently rubbing the lumen of the ring with forcep tips.",f3728bc1-be53-4f3a-a19d-899095dd235f
21,methods22," This procedure was validated by adding 10 µM acetylcholine (Sigma Chimica, Milan, Italy) at the plateau of phenylephrine-induced contraction: a relaxation greater than 70% or less than 10% denoted the presence or absence of functional endothelium, respectively [40].  2.14.3. Effect of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) Extracts on Phenylephrine-Induced Contraction  The effects of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts, added cumulatively, were assessed on 0.3 μM phenylephrine-induced contraction in either endothelium-intact or -denuded rings. Sodium nitroprusside (100 µM; Riedel-De Haën AG, Seelze-Hannover, Germany) was used to prove smooth muscle functional integrity at the end of each concentration–response curve. The response to phenylephrine was taken as 100%.  2.15. Statistical Analysis  For each of the variables tested, analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was used followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test.

Results and Discussion  We decided to analyze the qualitative profiles of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples in order to select the most interesting sample in terms of polyphenol content for further biological evaluation.  3.1. Acidity and Peroxides Analysis  Acidity and peroxide analyses were carried using standard protocols, as described in the Materials and Methods section.",a0a47e09-fc18-4867-ab6f-f3b39381804c
23,methods24," As reported in Table 1, all the samples showed very low acidity values, expressed as percentages of oleic acid, ranging from 0.08 to 0.15%. Similarly, peroxide values, expressed as meq O2/kg, appeared to be <10, far below the limit that the Italian legislation set as the maximum amount allowed to be labeled as Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (20 meq O2/kg). Taken together, these values demonstrated the high quality of the fruits and the observation of good practices during the harvest and the milling processes.  3.2. Determination of Methyl Esters of Fatty Acids by GC  This analysis was performed as described above to characterize the percentages of oleic and linoleic acids present in the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples. Table 1 lists the values of oleic acid (a monounsaturated ω-9 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (a polyunsaturated ω-6 fatty acid), being the most represented components of olive oil triglycerides (up to 83% of the total fatty acid content).",3720fe9c-4fa5-4c49-91a6-de4a7d6424a1
24,methods25," We decided to concentrate our attention on these fatty acids, as it is now widely accepted that they can exert interesting health-promoting effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cardio-protective effects [41,42]. These fatty acids presented similar values among all samples.  3.3. Tocopherols  Tocopherols represent the vitamin E content of olive oil, and they are known to play a synergistic antioxidant effect together with biophenols. Moreover, a supranutritional intake of tocopherols has been reported to be beneficial in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases [43]. For these reasons, we decided to evaluate the tocopherols content of the 18 Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples by following the above-mentioned protocol. As reported in Table 1, all samples display total contents of tocopherols ranging between 164 and 298 mg/kg, with the noteworthy exception of O_10, which possesses a remarkable value of 446 mg/kg.  3.4.",79a72d59-1025-4c64-b224-6b4a7d4783f1
25,methods26," Total Phenolic Content and Biophenols  In order to evaluate the biological properties of the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts, we performed two different analyses to elucidate the phenolic content. In particular, we applied an HPLC protocol to quantify the content of biophenols, such as the natural and oxidized derivatives of oleuropein and ligstroside, lignans, flavonoids, and phenolic acids [24]. As reported in Table 1, biophenol contents ranged from 227 mg/kg to 664 mg/kg, with good values shown by O_01 and O_08, constituted by three typical Tuscan cv., and by O_15 and O_10, constituted only by the rare Minuta di Chiusi and the more widespread Leccino cv., respectively. Furthermore, the total phenolic content (total phenolic content (TPC)) was measured using the Folin–Ciocalteu method, a recognized protocol for the quantitative determination of total phenolic compounds.",e6e2c27f-69d5-4a94-a46a-199094f964fc
26,methods27," Generally, all Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples displayed good total phenolic content (TPC) values ranging from 406 to 713 mg/kg, with O_01, O_03, O_08, O_10, O_14, and O_15 being the richest samples (600 to 700 mg/kg). Based on their total phenolic content (TPC) and biophenols values, we selected three samples, namely O_05, O_10, and O_15, to obtain their hydroalcoholic extracts, which were used to evaluate the biological properties of the phenolics present in representative Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s from Siena area. In particular, O_15 was selected due to its high total phenolic content (TPC) value (682 mg/kg) and because it is entirely produced from Minuta di Chiusi olives. Although O_10 was selected mainly for its high total phenolic content (TPC) value (713 mg/kg), it is noteworthy that it came from Leccino monocultivar, a cv. that is widespread in Italy.",f132e766-fe0a-4f7a-a349-bf26e300cd82
27,methods28," On the other hand, O_05 was chosen as a representative sample of intermediate total phenolic content (TPC) values, but also for its miscellaneous composition in terms of cv.  3.5. Isotopic Ratio Mass Spectrometry  It is widely known that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), and Italian Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) above all, is one of the main food products subjected to fraud. For this reason, we decided to submit some of the olive oil samples to the stable isotope ratio analysis, which by means of isotope ratio mass spectrometry (isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS)) can assay the content of the stable isotopes of some elements (H, C, O in this case) that are related to agricultural practices and pedoclimatic features of the specific geographical area where the olive trees are grown. Specifically, the isotopic 13C/12C, 18O/16O, and 2H/1H ratios change according to different factors, such as latitude, altitude, climate conditions, and distance from the sea [44].",133ddfcc-6543-4cc9-9ddb-a77bf3cd4107
28,methods29," In Table 2, the above-mentioned isotopic ratios for 6 Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples are reported, with the future aim of creating a database of the stable isotopic ratios of local olive oil samples from different cv., which can be applied to certify the origin and quality of the products.  3.6. Extraction and Chemical Characterization via 1H NMR and HRMS  As described in the material and methods section, starting from about 50 g of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), we obtained different amounts of polar extracts. From O_05 we obtained 66 mg of extract OE_05, from O_10 we obtained 71 mg of extract OE_10, and from O_15 we obtained 63 mg of extract OE_15. To verify the outcome of the extraction and to appreciate the chemical composition of the extracts, we performed 1H NMR experiments to identify the peculiar signals given by the main different components.",2ecb131b-df2a-4ef7-a00a-aa17ed787932
29,methods30," The results shown in Table 3 demonstrate the presence of the main distinguishable phenols, such as tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, and p-coumaric acid; secoiridoids, such as oleuropein and oleochantal; and lignans, such as 1-acetoxypinoresinol, among others. In the aliphatic region of the spectra, these polar components signals are hidden underneath the fatty acids and mono- and diacylglycerols (chemical shifts of δ 2.80–2.50 and δ 3.65–3.20 ppm) (Figure S1), suggesting a certain degree of co-extraction of some apolar compounds [29].  The HRMS analysis showed the presence of those compounds identified by NMR experiments. Nevertheless, the UHPLC analysis (Table 4) revealed the presence of the same compounds in all the samples (Figures S2–S4 and Table S2).",061f2760-72b9-4d18-875b-3dfb14a01588
30,methods31," The principal compounds identified were oleacinic acid, oleocanthalic acid, various isomers of oleuropein, and ligstroside (aglycone and glycosides forms), although in particular two polyphenols, oleuropein and luteolin, were present in high amounts, which were experimentally calculated as reported in Figure 2.  3.7. Evaluation of Protective Effects of OE_05, OE_10, and OE_15 on CaCo-2 Cells  3.7.1. MTT Assay  Upon arrival, Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts were suspended in 100 μL of DMSO and stored at 4 °C, avoiding direct light. The MTT assays for OE_05, OE_10, and OE_15 were performed on CaCo-2 cells to evaluate the non-toxic treatment dose. Cells were treated for 24 h with different concentration of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts (2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 μg/mL) and DMSO at different doses (vehicle 1 and vehicle 2), suspended in completed DMEM high-glucose media.",0404af16-d1e2-4d82-b810-c8f810fca394
31,methods32,"  As shown in Figure 3, the doses that led to a slight cell viability decrease were in the range of 30 to 50 μg/mL (less than 70% of cell viability), whereas the other doses did not display any significant differences in cell viability compared to control cells (ctrl). Hence, since the 20 μg/mL concentration was the highest dose not displaying toxicity on CaCo-2 cells, we decided to use Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts at this concentration to perform the experiment and ensure a possible protective effect.  3.7.2. Antioxidant Properties of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) Extracts  To evaluate the antioxidant properties of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts, we triggered CaCo-2 cells with the oxidoreductase enzyme glucose oxidase (GO), which catalyzes the oxidation of glucose in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a known oxidative mediator.",c9e11daa-2cfb-4e44-a0f8-89b4dd115830
32,methods33," After pre-treating CaCo-2 cells with 20 μg/mL OE_05, OE_10, or OE_15, we assessed an AmplexRed assay to measure the levels of H2O2 produced over 1 h of GO 0.5 U/mL treatment. As depicted in Figure 4a, GO exposure induced higher levels of H2O2 production at all selected timepoints. Even though OE_05 and OE_10 did not completely abrogate the H2O2 production compared to control cells, they could reduce the levels of H2O2 induced by GO. To test whether the reduction of the H2O2 production found in CaCo-2 cells was due to the ability of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts to induce an antioxidant response responsible for counteracting the GO-induced oxidative impairment, we assessed by immunofluorescence staining the possible activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Indeed, Nrf2 activation can control the transcription of several genes involved in the cellular antioxidant response.",2196459c-499a-4ea1-9bc7-8bc0cfd4a5d4
33,methods34," As depicted in Figure 4b, the GO insult induced a slight increase in Nrf2 expression levels right after GO exposure (T0) and even more evidently after 1 h (T1). Interestingly, both Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts led to significant increases in Nrf2 expression levels upon GO insult, especially at T0, and these increases were still evident 1 h after GO exposure, even if they were lower compared to GO exposure alone. Since the activation of Nrf2 can trigger the transcription of several genes involved in the antioxidant response of the cell to restore cell homeoastasis [45], we decided to measure the transcriptional expression levels of two of the main genes under the control of Nrf2, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 1 (NQO1).",07b47508-a629-4be1-a3fe-c35d7b12ac15
34,methods35," We found that GO upregulated the mRNA expression levels of both GPx1 (Figure 4c) and NQO1 (Figure 4d) 6 h post exposure and that the cells pre-treated with either OE_05 or OE_10 and exposed to GO displayed much higher mRNA expression levels of these two genes compared to GO-exposed cells. Since both GPx1 and NQO1 are required in the detoxification process of the cells, helping in reducing the production of radical species, their increased mRNA expression could suggest the ability of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts to stimulate the antioxidant response of the cells and make the cells more promptly respond to the eventual oxidative insult.",1fe0aceb-953c-4aef-b46a-e61c49bf2b6a
35,methods36," Indeed, although the olive oil compounds did not completely prevent the oxidative impairment induced by the GO insult as suggested by the presence of high H2O2 levels even after the pre-treatment, the compounds showed an ability to modulate the antioxidant response of the cells by increasing the Nrf2 expression and the transcriptional levels of Nrf2-related genes GPx1 and NQO1 upon GO insult.  3.7.3. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) Extracts Showed Anti-Inflammatory Properties against Glucose Oxidase Insult  Nowadays, oxinflammation is a well-known phenomenon characterized by the cross-talk of oxidative and inflammatory features that can influence each other to promote a more severe cellular homeostasis impairment in a variety of conditions [46,47,48,49].",bbd85f94-1c00-4d63-b13d-6c0428e3a4a4
36,methods37,"  To evaluate whether the altered oxidative status induced by the GO insult in CaCo-2 cells could affect and activate also an inflammatory response and whether the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts OE_05, OE_10, and OE_15 could display anti-inflammatory properties, we measured several markers involved in the inflammatory response. Hence, immunofluorescence staining and rt-PCR analysis were carried out to investigate the expression levels of one of the most activated transcription factors, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), as well as the mRNA expression levels of some NF-κB related genes such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), which are usually upregulated during inflammatory status.",d341b5f4-0143-4151-8a16-760de0e7fbde
37,methods38," As depicted in Figure 5a, GO exposure significantly increased NF-κB expression levels either at 0 or 1 h post-exposure, suggesting the activation of an inflammatory response upon the oxidative insult due to a cross-talk between oxidative and inflammatory pathways. Of note, OE_05 and OE_10 reduced the expression of NF-κB at both timepoints, completely restoring the NF-κB basal-level expression 1 h after the end of GO exposure, as in control cells. In addition, OE_05 and OE_10 pre-treatment completely abrogated the increased IL-6 mRNA expression levels induced 6 h after GO exposure, confirming how the presence of specific substances, including flavones apigenin and luteolin, contributed to the anti-inflammatory properties [50] of the two Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts (Figure 5b). Regarding COX2, the gene did not turn out to be modulated by GO insult, as shown in Figure 5c.  These data are in line with OE polyphenol content data.",89b7762b-f5e0-4f22-a9cf-48c4de0597c9
38,methods39," In fact, other studies demonstrated how Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) phenolics were able to inhibit TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) activity, which in turn inhibited NF-κB signaling, reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) such as IL-1β and CXCL1 (chemokine C-X-C motif Ligand 1) at the molecular level, as well as IL-6 [51].  On the other hand, Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts derived from different cultivars showed potent anti-inflammatory properties thanks to a marked upregulation of the antioxidant enzymes heme oxygenase 1, NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1, thioredoxin reductase 1, and glutathione reductase [9].",fa06b84b-78e5-40de-ad6a-88a5c610ba37
39,methods40,"  Furthermore, the phenolic compounds present in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts showed promising anti-inflammatory properties; in particular, luteolin is able to inhibit H2O2-induced oxidative stress, activating the AMPK and Nrf2 pathways [52], while apigenin is able to reduce the production of inflammatory markers such as TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, with significant inhibition of the active caspase-3 pathway and the pro-apoptotic Bax protein [53].  3.8. Effects of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) Extracts on Phenylephrine-Induced Contraction in Rat Thoracic Aorta Rings  The vasorelaxant activity of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts was assessed on α1 adrenergic-receptor-mediated vascular smooth muscle contraction. As shown in Figure 6, OE_05, OE_10, and OE_15 caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of endothelium-denuded rings contracted by 0.3 μM phenylephrine, with IC50 values of 41.8 µg/mL (estimated), 75.7 µg/mL (estimated), and 6.4 ± 1.6 µg/mL (n = 5).",e67e095c-b6d8-4a28-a2f2-b79e55dc67d7
40,methods41," In a second series of experiments, the three extracts were assessed on rings with an intact endothelium. OE_15 reverted phenylephrine-induced contraction, with an IC50 value that was not significantly different from that recorded in preparations devoid of endothelium (4.1 ± 1.9 µg/mL, n = 6; p = 0.3866). However, both OE_05 and OE_10 showed markedly lower vasorelaxant activity levels, accounting for a mere 20% relaxation of the active muscle tone (Figure 6a,b).  These data demonstrate that OE_05 and OE_10 stimulate the release of endothelium-derived contracting factors, which are yet to be characterized. In endothelium-denuded rings, in fact, myorelaxant activity occurred at lower concentrations as compared to endothelium-intact specimens. Contrary to OE_05 and OE_10, OE_15, besides being the most effective extract, also showed a vasorelaxant activity that was not influenced by the presence of an intact endothelium.",3ff6b358-d4dc-4751-a64d-a757336fa7ed
41,methods42," This supports the hypothesis that the three extracts are capable of directly targeting the smooth muscle cells and activating vasorelaxant mechanisms, thereby ensuring a persistent decrease in active muscle tone, a phenomenon worthy of note. In fact, it is reasonable to think that this endothelium-independent vasorelaxant activity can counteract the reduced NO synthesis that characterizes a dysfunctional endothelium occurring in cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension [54,55,56].  Taking into account the chemical composition of the extracts, their vasoactivity is likely due to the presence of apigenin and luteolin which act as potent KCa1.1 channel stimulators [57,58,59], as well as oleuropein and tocopherols, although the latter are known to act mainly in an endothelium-dependent manner [60,61].  However, apigenin and luteolin are also effective CaV1.2 channel current stimulators [50], thereby leading to vessel contraction.",fefae668-88b5-4077-b6b7-d52353ce17c1
42,methods43," Therefore, it is conceivable that the combined actions of all the components present in the extracts may be the main driver of vasorelaxation, as recently demonstrated in our laboratory [59].  Another important issue that should be taken into account is the extensive metabolism affecting polyphenol bioavailability and causing a partial loss of or even masking their bioefficacy [62,63]. These metabolites, however, can be locally converted back to the parent compound, for example through the activity of glucuronidases, thereby preserving the same activity observed in vitro [64].  4. Conclusions  In this work, we investigated autochthonous Tuscany Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) cv. by evaluating their qualitative properties as source of fats. Then, selected Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s were subjected to extraction in order to obtain polar extracts, which were further analyzed.",300413c8-af73-4f68-9e79-3cb89efd4c00
43,methods44," In particular, they were chemically characterized via 1H-NMR and UHPLC-HRMS analyses, showing the presence of luteolin and apigenin as representative flavones, as well as oleuropein, ligstroside, and pinoresinol, which are known to be present in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) polar fractions. These three extracts were then analyzed as anti-inflammatory phytocomplexes in CaCo-2 cells exposed to glucose oxidase. They reduced the inflammatory stimuli by modulating Nrf2 and NF-κB pathways, probably due to the presence of flavone compounds. Furthermore, they promoted vasorelaxation in rat aorta rings contracted by phenylephrine. In conclusion, we showed new potential nutraceutical applications of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) polar extracts obtained from autochthonous Tuscany cv. grown in the Siena area.
