0,methods0,"4.1. Subjects The study included 46 subjects, belonging to the North Jaén Area Health Authority, Andalusian Health Service (SAS) (Jaén, Spain). They were divided in two groups in a cross-sectional study: 25 healthy controls volunteers (C group, 44% men and 56% female) and 21 metabolic syndrome patients (MS group, 48% men and 52% female) (The Third Report National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, ATP III diagnostic criteria). The study protocol was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the North Jaén Area Health Authority. All participants were informed of the objectives of this study before they provided written consent to participate in it.",02638c98-1de9-4bd9-8893-6d709154cb4b
1,methods1," The following exclusion criteria were considered: age under 50 and over 65 years old, post- menopausal women, abdominal hernia, an increase or decrease of 5 kg or more in body weight during last six months, type 1 diabetics, cardiac insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency or neoplastic disease, and treatment with insulin or incretin therapy.  4.2. Data Collection Anthropometric measurements were made according to the recommendations of the International Standards for Anthropometric Assessment (ISAK, 2001). Body weight was measured using an electronic scale (±0.1 kg). Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2). Criteria used to define overweight were the ones of the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)), as a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2. Abdominal waist and hip circumferences were measured using a flexible steel tape (Holtain LTD, Crosswell, UK).",43308228-f45e-4237-b7d0-a4f92fda759f
2,methods2," Waist circumference was measured half-way between the lower costal border and the iliac crest. Hip circumference was measured at the level of the maximum extension of the buttocks posteriorly in a horizontal plane, without compressing the skin. Anthropometric skinfold considered were: tricipital (PT), bicipital (PBi), subscapular (PSb) and suprailiac (PS) and determined (mm) using a standard caliper (Holtain LTD).  Cardiovascular risks were calculated for each patient according to the criteria of the SCORE project [32]. The Mediterranean Diet Adherence (AMeDit) was estimated using a scale that indicates the degree of adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet [33].  Plasma glucose and HbA1c were determined in fasting conditions (10 h) using an autosampler Hitachi (Roche) by glucose oxidase/peroxidase method and PNT ADAMS A1C HA 8160 for HbA1c measurement. A second blood sample was obtained in postprandial conditions 30 min after a breakfast (919.6 KJ) consisting of 44.",9999b2d0-92a9-428e-b5d6-47172b9606ba
3,methods3,"2% carbohydrates, 35% lipids (26.6% saturated fatty acids, 61.1% monounsaturated fatty acids and 9.1% polysaturated fatty acids) and 20.8% protein. Insulin and Glucagon like peptide (GLP)-1 levels were determined in these plasma samples with Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA)) and a DPP4 inhibitor (Millipore), using Bio-plex Pro™ magnetic bead-based assays (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) on the Bio-plex® platform (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 activity levels were determined in plasma sample by a fluorimetric assay using l-Gly-Pro-4-Methoxy-β-naphthylamide as substrate. Briefly, 20 µL of each sample were incubated with 90 µL of a substrate solution at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured continuously for 30 min. at 412 nm emission wavelength with an excitation wavelength of 345 nm in a FLUOstarOPTIMA microplate reader (BMG Labtech, San Diego, CA, USA).",c7c0daea-dbf5-49fd-af60-0a8bf74ce94c
4,methods4," The fluorescence values obtained were converted to pmol of the released β-naphthylamine by extrapolating to a standard curve previously obtained after the determination of decreasing concentrations of β-naphthylamine in a medium equal to the corresponding substrate solution. Values were expressed as pmol of β-naphthylamine released per minute of incubation and per mL of plasma.  4.3. Statistical Analysis Data were expressed as mean ± standard error. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 15.0, IBM, New York, NY, USA). One-way ANOVA was used in order to analyze mean differences among groups. When significant differences were found (p < 0.05), post hoc Tukey’s test was performed to identify the source of these differences. A generalized linear regression model was used to detect the interaction between DPP4 activity and anthropometrics, dietetic, or biochemical parameters. ",fc3c7a67-cc97-4d24-94ea-cfcb7906e570
