0,results0," Out of 502 women who joined our dietary intervention trial, 438 had a complete genetic test. Among them, 375 (85.6%) were ascertained as the carriers of loss of function (LOF) variants and 63 (14.4%) of nonsynonymous variants in BRCA1/2 genes. The general characteristics of the study population are reported in Table 1. Among nonsynonymous variant carriers, those with BRCA1 mutations (71.4%) were more represented than in loss of function (LOF) variant carriers (59.7%) (p = 0.08). The history of pregnancy slightly differed between loss of function (LOF) and nonsynonymous variant carriers, with a younger age at first live birth (p = 0.07) and a higher number of children in the former group (p = 0.41). The loss of function (LOF) variant carriers showed a slightly lower level of education and higher frequency of natural menopause compared to nonsynonymous variant carriers. As for the disease status, 216 (82.4%) women had a previous diagnosis of BC, 10 (3.8%) had both BC and OC, 36 (13.",9da72836-9c9e-4807-b894-8dc1e4e9710c

Among BC cases, the women with nonsynonymous variants were significantly more affected by estrogen receptor-negative tumors (p = 0.03). Concerning food frequency consumption, at the baseline, the two groups were fairly homogeneous as regards the consumption of recommended and not-recommended food. However, nonsynonymous variant carriers showed a slightly higher consumption of vegetables (p = 0.06) and legumes/soy products (p = 0.08), while loss of function (LOF) variant carriers showed a slightly higher consumption of sugary foods (p = 0.35) (data not shown).

Overall, 366 women, including 193 randomized into the IG and 173 in the CG, concluded the 6-month dietary intervention and were available for the final examinations. Among these, 312 were carriers of loss of function (LOF) variants and 54 of nonsynonymous variants. At the end of the 6-month intervention, all women significantly improved most of the parameters under study, with a major effect in the IG (Supplementary Table S2).  Table 2 shows the before–after analysis in IG and CG by the pathogenic variant type. loss of function (LOF) variant carriers in the IG experienced a higher improvement of the majority of the parameters under study, while nonsynonymous carriers in the IG showed a significant reduction only in weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumferences, glycemia, and total cholesterol levels.",b4b7cdb0-50f6-4f76-90e1-8363014883c6
3,results7," The “delta” analysis of the differences between the two randomized groups controlling for the center, age, body mass index (BMI) at baseline, and baseline value of the variable under study showed that among loss of function (LOF) variant carriers, there was a significantly more pronounced decrease in the IG compared to the CG of the following parameters: weight (p < 0.001); body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001); waist and hip circumferences (p = 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively); and the levels of total cholesterol (p = 0.04), triglycerides (p = 0.02), and insulin (p = 0.04) (Table 3). Conversely, in the carriers of nonsynonymous variants, no significant differences were detected for any of the parameters considered, when comparing the changes between the baseline and end-of-treatment values in the IG vs. the CG.",271288d5-a8dd-4892-a8db-911e44a1629f
4,results8," Performing the “delta” analysis of differences including the pathogenic variant type into the model, we observed that the difference in insulin level reduction between IG and CG was significantly higher in loss of function (LOF) (−3.9 µIU/ml) compared to nonsynonymous (−0.5 µIU/ml) variant carriers (p < 0.01). In the “delta” analysis of differences, a further significant result was obtained concerning the systolic pressure. In the loss of function (LOF) variant carriers, the decrease of the values of this parameter in the IG and CG was virtually equivalent (Δ = −0.1 mmHg). In nonsynonymous variant carriers, the values of systolic pressure remained almost unaltered in IG, while we observed an increase in CG (Δ = −3.1 mmHg; p < 0.01). Table 4 reports the changes in the frequencies of food consumption from the 24 h food frequency diaries (intention-to-treat analysis, IG vs. CG) by the pathogenic variant type.",fbd6f780-78e6-49a2-991a-7485df28a1a8
5,results9," The “delta” analysis of differences between the two randomized groups showed that in the IG of both nonsynonymous and loss of function (LOF) variant carriers, there was a significantly higher reduction of the consumption of dairy products compared to the corresponding CG (p = 0.04). In addition, the IG of the loss of function (LOF) variant carriers showed a borderline significantly higher reduction of the consumption of red/processed meat and total animal products, and a borderline significantly higher increase of the consumption of whole grains compared to the CG. Including the pathogenic variant type into the model, we did not observe any significant difference among the dietary changes in nonsynonymous variant carriers compared to loss of function (LOF) variant carriers.

6,discussion0," We had previously shown that in the whole population of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who joined our 6-month randomized controlled trial, the dietary intervention based on the Mediterranean diet with moderate protein restriction was effective in reducing IGF-I, body weight, and MS markers but not insulin . In the present study, we evaluated in the 366 female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers from the same trial whether the changes in the levels of metabolic and hormonal factors, in response to the dietary intervention, were influenced by the type of pathogenic variants (loss of function (LOF) vs. nonsynonymous). Our findings indicated at the end of the intervention period that the serum levels of insulin in loss of function (LOF) variant carriers were significantly more reduced than in nonsynonymous variant carriers.",8dd57ef4-927e-4b59-a093-5891d59f0a1e
7,discussion1," These observations support the hypothesis that the loss of function (LOF) of BRCA proteins might result in a different response of metabolic factors to diet, possibly due to a genetic effect. This hypothesis is further supported by the lack of significant differences in the changes of dietary habits when comparing the IG of loss of function (LOF) vs. nonsynonymous variant carriers. It has to be remarked that since we had previously observed that higher levels of insulin at baseline were significantly associated with BRCA loss of function (LOF) variants , the intention-to-treat analysis was carried out controlling for the baseline insulin levels, to rule out a possible bias due to this factor.  Insulin, stimulating mitosis and inhibiting apoptosis, promotes cancer growth (Draznin, 2010). Since BRCA mutations affect the mechanisms of DNA damage repair, the carriers of BRCA mutations may be more sensitive to the mitogenic effect of insulin.",94a322d9-54f1-4dba-8b95-66bf74e22b95
8,discussion2," Previous studies suggested that nonsynonymous variants in BRCA genes are associated with a reduced risk of BC in comparison to loss of function (LOF) variants (Spurdle et al., 2014; Shimelis et al., 2017; Moghadasi et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, insulin resistance and obesity are associated with hereditary BC . We found that these conditions are more frequent in BRCA1/2 loss of function (LOF) carriers. These associations seemed stronger in BRCA2 carriers . Therefore, the results of the present study, although preliminary, open new perspectives for the investigations of the correlation between metabolic factors and BRCA-related cancer and suggest the possibility to introduce “personalized” dietary treatments in high-risk BRCA variant carriers, as a risk-reduction measure, taking into account the mutation type.",9b0b323d-3430-4454-b460-d2250013921f
9,discussion3,"  The major limitation of this study is the relatively small number of nonsynonymous variant carriers in our trial population. Therefore, additional similar studies, including a larger number of BRCA mutation carriers, are needed to support our conclusions. Furthermore, without a prospective evaluation, we could not quantify the effects on the BRCA-related cancer risk of the greater reduction of serum insulin observed in loss of function (LOF) variant carriers. To date, no other studies have evaluated the roles of a dietary intervention on BRCA-related cancer in relation to the variant type. Thus, the follow-up of our cohort could provide an evidence-based rationale in support of a healthy lifestyle as a personalized risk-reduction measure for BRCA mutation carriers.",dd4ed05c-952d-48dd-9264-d3bb322896d3
