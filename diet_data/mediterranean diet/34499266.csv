0,methods0," Study design and cancer follow-up  The Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) started in September 1986 and included 58,279 men and 62,573 women aged 55–69 years [23]. At baseline, participants completed a mailed, self-administered questionnaire on cancer risk factors. The Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) study was approved by institutional review boards from Maastricht University and the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research. All cohort members consented to participation by completing the questionnaire. For data processing and analysis the case-cohort method was used [24]. Accumulated person-years in the cohort were estimated from a subcohort (n = 5000; 2411 men and 2589 women), randomly sampled from the cohort immediately after baseline. These subcohort members were actively followed up biennially for vital status information using population registries.",dbf74394-9e04-425c-a754-616d0f28b3c2
1,methods1,"  Follow-up for cancer incidence was established by annual record linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry and PALGA, the nationwide Dutch Pathology Registry [25]. Completeness of follow-up through record linkage with cancer registries and PALGA was estimated to be greater than 95% [26]. During 20.3 years of follow-up (September 17, 1986 until December 31, 2006), 164 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), 259 esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), 254 gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and 741 gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) cases without prevalent cancer (except skin cancer) at baseline were detected. Histology codes for esophageal cancer (ICD-O-3 code C15) included 8050–8076 for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and 8140–8141, 8190–8231, 8260–8263, 8310, 8430, 8480–8481, 8490, 8560, and 8570–8572 for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). For gastric cancer (ICD-O-3 code C16), histology codes were C16.0 for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and C16.1–16.",2f24b724-b1f9-4b14-a82f-e6c2291ffa01
2,methods2,"9 for gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA). After excluding participants with prevalent cancer (except skin cancer) at baseline from the subcohort, 4774 subcohort members remained. Participants with incomplete or inconsistent dietary data, or missing values for the other considered lifestyle factors and predefined confounders were excluded from the analysis. In the current analysis, 133 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), 200 esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), 191 gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and 586 gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) cases, and 3,720 subcohort members were included (Supplementary Figure S1).  Exposure assessment  The 11-page baseline questionnaire measured dietary intake (including alcohol), detailed smoking habits, anthropometry, physical activity and other risk factors related to cancer [23].",17e041cd-6fed-4201-8df1-cd7c50ed90b0
3,methods3," Habitual consumption of food and beverages during the year preceding baseline was assessed using a 150-item semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. The food-frequency questionnaire has been validated and tested for reproducibility [27, 28]. Nutrient intakes were calculated using the computerized Dutch food composition table [29]. Consumption of alcoholic beverages was addressed by questions on beer, red wine, white wine, sherry and other fortified wines, liqueur types containing on average 16% ethanol, and (Dutch) gin, brandy, and whiskey. Respondents who consumed alcoholic beverages less than once a month were considered non-users. Tobacco smoking was addressed through questions on smoking status (never, ex, or current smoker) and inhalation for cigarette, cigar, and pipe smokers. Additional questions were asked on the ages at first and last exposure to smoking, smoking frequency, and duration for cigarette, cigar, and pipe smokers.",1a1135ae-0ea5-422f-897f-b34ac57bf019
4,methods4," Information on height (in cm) and weight at baseline (in kg) was also collected using the self-administered questionnaire, from which BMI (weight/height2) was calculated in kg/m2. Non-occupational physical activity was calculated by adding the minutes spent per day on cycling or walking, shopping, walking the dog, gardening, and sports or exercise as reported previously [30].  Mediterranean diet score  Adherence to the MD was assessed using the alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMED) [31, 32], which is an adapted version of the traditional Mediterranean Diet Score created by Trichopoulou et al. [33, 34]. The aMED contains 9 dietary components that are typical of the Mediterranean diet. To control for energy intake, the intake of each component was first adjusted to a daily intake of 2000 kcal [31, 32, 34].",9a51847a-ba4c-4edf-8ecd-9191b60bace3
5,methods5," For each of the presumed beneficial food items [vegetables (without potatoes), legumes, fruits, nuts, whole grains, fish, and the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acid intake (MUFA:SFA)], one point was given when the intake was at least the sex-specific median intake, and zero otherwise. For red and processed meat, 1 point was given (and 0 otherwise) when the intake was below the sex-specific median intake. In the full aMED, 1 additional point is normally given when alcohol intake is between 5 and 25 g/day, and 0 otherwise [32]. However, since alcohol is a risk factor for esophageal and probably also gastric cancer [35, 36], alcohol was excluded from the score in the present analysis. The reduced 9-point sum score (aMEDr) ranged from zero to eight points (minimal to maximal conformity).",3e9e844a-fc77-4941-ab70-5d8e26d417cf
6,methods6,"  Healthy lifestyle score  Following a previous analysis of a combined healthy lifestyle score and mortality [37] (in which binary scores were used for adherence to component lifestyles), a more refined healthy lifestyle score was constructed to appraise a higher proportion of the variability in the population, as done by Romaguera et al. [18]. In this healthy lifestyle score (healthy lifestyle score (HLS)), scores for five modifiable lifestyle factors (BMI, smoking, physical activity, Mediterranean diet adherence, and alcohol intake) were combined, while each component factor was scored on three levels, representing full (score 1), partial (0.5) and noncompliance (0) with the public health recommendation for that component. Table S1 shows the cutoffs and scores for each of these five factors. The cutoffs for physical activity and alcohol were in line with recommendations from the Health Council of the Netherlands [38, 39].",cdac02bc-2e16-4607-beb4-0473054253b4
7,methods7, The combined sum score ranged from zero to five points (minimal to maximal healthy lifestyle). ,f4f1a2ad-3e36-471c-a9e5-d3f51097d05b
8,analysis0," Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations of the combined healthy lifestyle score with incidence of esophageal and gastric cancer subtypes were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models with follow-up duration as time variable. Person-years at risk for subcohort members were calculated from baseline until diagnosis of esophageal or gastric cancer, death, emigration, loss to follow-up or end of follow-up, whichever came first. Standard errors were estimated using the Huber-White sandwich estimator to account for the increased variance because of subcohort sampling [40]. It was verified that the proportional hazards assumption was not violated using scaled Schoenfeld residuals [41] and − ln(− ln) survival plots. Because most previous studies published on overall esophageal or gastric cancer, results for these outcomes are presented (enabling literature comparisons) next to subtypes of esophageal and gastric cancer.",496d72d5-ad62-4960-a06a-58a862fb505d
9,analysis1,"  The associations between the healthy lifestyle score (HLS) and risk of esophageal and gastric cancer subtypes were investigated on a categorical and continuous scale in survival analyses. We combined both sexes, because of the limited number of cases and because no statistically significant interaction by sex was found. The healthy lifestyle score (HLS) score was categorized based on the distribution in the subcohort into 6 categories: 0–1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4–5 points. Participants with a healthy lifestyle score (HLS) of 2 points formed the reference group in categorical analyses, because category 0–1.5 was too small. Tests for trends were assessed by assigning median values of the lifestyle score in the subcohort to the exposure categories and fitting these as continuous terms in the regression models. In the continuous analyses, HRs were estimated per increment of 1 point.",177ece69-ceaa-439a-9070-2dc449631d8e
10,analysis2,"  In multivariable-adjusted survival analyses, the associations were adjusted for the following predefined (literature-based) confounders, which were included in the final multivariable-adjusted model independent of their effect on the estimated HRs: age at baseline (years; continuous), sex (male/female), smoking frequency (number of cigarettes per day; continuous, centered), and duration (number of years; continuous, centered), highest level of education [primary school or lower vocational (low), secondary school or medium vocational (medium), and higher vocational or university (high)], total energy intake (kcal/day; continuous), family history of esophageal (for esophageal cancer subtypes) or gastric cancer (for gastric cancer subtypes).",441112c6-e9f5-4ae9-a966-d64ce3114b16
11,analysis3," Because a recent Canadian cohort study showed only inverse associations with healthy lifestyle score (HLS) for participants without chronic conditions at baseline [42], we also included history of chronic diseases at baseline [physician-diagnosed myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, asthma or bronchitis (no, yes)] as covariate.  For the analyses regarding the healthy lifestyle score, the association between each of the component lifestyle factors and cancer risk was evaluated first in Cox regression, while controlling for age, education, energy intake, family history of esophageal/ gastric cancer, history of chronic diseases, and additionally for the other lifestyle components.  The distribution of the subcohort members by the combined healthy lifestyle score and various characteristics was examined by cross-tabulations and summary statistics, for men and women.",fd55891a-2c0f-4461-a4da-00589962de1b
12,analysis4," Distributions of general characteristics for esophageal and gastric cancer subtype cases, as well as subcohort members, were calculated as frequencies for categorical variables and means with standard deviations for continuous variables.  To further investigate the dose–response relations between the healthy lifestyle score and risk of esophageal and gastric cancer subtypes, restricted cubic splines with three knots were used to graphically present the dose–response curves without making a priori assumptions about their shapes. Wald tests were performed to evaluate the linearity of these relationships.  In addition to the main analyses of the healthy lifestyle score and risk of cancer subtypes, analyses were also stratified by age, sex, level of education, family history of esophageal (or gastric) cancer, and history of chronic diseases. Interactions with these factors were tested using Wald tests and cross-product terms.",0c71dd82-c73c-43eb-bafa-5a66eb681e1f
13,analysis5," Because of low cancer case numbers, these analyses were conducted using continuous lifestyle scores. In sensitivity analyses, analyses were repeated after excluding cancers (and person-years) occurring in the first two years of follow-up, and also after splitting the follow-up period in three periods.  Because of the importance of smoking as a cancer risk factor, an additional analysis was done with a combined healthy lifestyle score, which excluded smoking, to evaluate the importance of lifestyle factors other than smoking.  The impact of a change in lifestyle score was estimated using the rate advancement period (rate advancement period (RAP)) [43], by dividing the regression coefficient of the lifestyle score by the regression coefficient of age. The linearity between the log(hazard) and age was verified using restricted cubic splines regression.",1fd72e08-c746-4adc-abf4-3d2df8a5d679
14,analysis6," Confidence intervals for rate advancement period (RAP) were calculated using variance and covariance estimates for the regression coefficients [43].  Population attributable fractions were calculated [44] to estimate the potentially avoidable proportion of cancer if all participants would shift towards the healthiest lifestyle category. The STATA-command “punafcc” was used to calculate the population attributable fractions and 95% CIs [45]. Analyses were performed using Stata version 14; presented P values are two-sided, with P < 0.05 considered as statistically significant. ",4c89e4f3-2803-46c6-8011-1c5f00b8073e
15,results0," The mean (SD) score of the combined healthy lifestyle score (healthy lifestyle score (HLS)) among subcohort members was 3.0 (0.9); for men it was 2.8 (0.9) and for women 3.3 (0.8). Table 1 summarizes several baseline characteristics by healthy lifestyle score in male and female subcohort members. Age and energy intake were not related to the healthy lifestyle score in men and women. While the associations between the healthy lifestyle score and alcohol intake, aMEDr score, BMI, and smoking were as expected considering the score composition, women with a high score were somewhat more often highly educated. Women in the lowest category of the healthy lifestyle score more often reported a history of chronic diseases. Family history of esophageal or gastric cancer seemed not clearly related to the score.",7c701d04-8eea-48b0-a663-22bc2ef90cd2

These analyses showed inverse associations between the healthy lifestyle score excluding smoking and cancer risk in all subgroups (Supplementary Figure S6), with significant associations for overall esophageal cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in current smokers or those who stopped less than 10 years ago, and for gastric cancer and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) among never smokers or those who stopped at least 10 years ago.",d708f220-cabf-4209-89bb-ded712e171eb

36,discussion0," In this large prospective study among Dutch men and women aged 55–69 years, a healthy lifestyle score (healthy lifestyle score (HLS)) which combined nonsmoking, having a normal BMI, being physically active, adhering to a Mediterranean Diet, with no or low alcohol intake, showed a strong statistically significant inverse relationship with risk of esophageal and gastric cancer, in a linear fashion. A one-point increment of the healthy lifestyle score (HLS) was accompanied by a HR reduction of 31% for overall esophageal, and 19% for gastric cancer. For the cancer subtypes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA), associations with the healthy lifestyle score (HLS) were also significantly inverse, but not significantly for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).",eed87925-c7c8-42bc-9183-2e34327f0b46
37,discussion1," The observed HR reductions per 1-point increment were 49% for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), 14% for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), 23% for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and 18% for gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA). There was significant interaction with level of education for gastric cancer and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA); significant inverse associations with healthy lifestyle score (HLS) were only found in those with a low or medium level of education. These results suggest that adhering to a combination of healthy modifiable lifestyle factors may substantially reduce the risk of esophageal and gastric cancer (subtypes). Also after excluding smoking, inverse associations between the healthy lifestyle score (HLS) and risk of esophageal and gastric cancer were still apparent.  A recent meta-analysis reported summary HRs (95%CI) for the healthiest versus least healthy combined lifestyle were 0.42 (0.24, 0.75) for esophageal cancer, and 0.60 (0.",d4c34106-4032-4b2e-91a8-b8ab64cbfd0a
38,discussion2,"48, 0.74) for gastric cancer [9]. However, they noted substantial heterogeneity in the published risk estimates, especially for esophageal cancer. In the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS), the HR estimates observed for the healthiest lifestyle category in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) for esophageal (HR = 0.45) and gastric cancer (HR = 0.52) are consistent with the meta-analysis estimates.  For esophageal cancer, previous cohort studies reported inverse associations with healthy lifestyle indices combining the components smoking, BMI, physical activity, diet and alcohol [14], or without smoking [17, 18]. The inverse associations with the healthy lifestyle score (HLS) excluding smoking in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) are in line with those from EPIC [18] and the NIH-AARP [17], with no indication of effect modification by sex.",ce79282c-2d22-4894-b921-22efb6f5004f
39,discussion3," When the full healthy lifestyle score (HLS) (including smoking) was used, the inverse association became stronger in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS), whereas a Chinese cohort study [14] reported weak associations with a healthy lifestyle score (HLS) including smoking. Results of studies might differ between regions of the world because one subtype of esophageal and gastric cancers is more predominant in certain countries, and the risk factors might differ between regions.  None of these previous studies looked into esophageal cancer subtypes. In the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS), the inverse association was strong and significant in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), while for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) it was considerably weaker and nonsignificant, with or without smoking as component. The Golestan study [20] is the only other study looking into a subtype (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)).",9ea1552e-66ef-4625-92fd-f44117c25c33
40,discussion4," They also found a very strong association with a combination of lifestyle and environmental risk factors, but several of these factors seem less relevant for the Western world, e.g. opium smoking, drinking hot tea, tooth loss, indoor air pollution. No other studies have been reported on combined healthy lifestyle and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).  Regarding gastric cancer risk, inverse associations with healthy lifestyle indices combining the components smoking, BMI, physical activity, diet and alcohol were found in cohort studies [though not in all [14]] from Singapore and China [13, 15], also for the subtypes gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) [13]. Inverse associations were also found when smoking was excluded from the healthy lifestyle score (HLS), in the NIH-AARP and EPIC cohorts [17, 18]. Jin et al.",294ff59d-1420-4dae-b185-34bd1b58edfe
41,discussion5," [16] observed an inverse association with a healthy lifestyle score (HLS) combining smoking, alcohol and diet for overall gastric cancer risk in the Chinese Kadoori cohort. Buckland et al. [19] studied overall and subtypes gastric cancer in the EPIC cohort, using adherence to the Mediterranean diet to characterize a healthy dietary pattern. The index combining smoking, alcohol, MD adherence, and BMI (only for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA)) was rather strongly inversely associated with risk of overall gastric cancer, and the subtypes gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA), without effect modification by sex. MD adherence was inversely related to risk of esophageal and gastric cancer risk in a recent meta-analysis [46].  As generally observed in previous studies, no significant differences between men and women regarding healthy lifestyle score (HLS) and esophageal or gastric cancer risk were found in the current study.",c8cbb0b0-9888-4565-a291-08fb160987f4
42,discussion6," In the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS), a significant interaction was seen between the healthy lifestyle score (HLS) and level of education for gastric cancer and its subtypes. The inverse association was most apparent in those with low or middle level of education. Few other studies have evaluated interaction with other factors; Buckland et al. [19] found no differences according to educational level or smoking status. In the recent meta-analysis [9] on healthy lifestyle score (HLS) and cancer risk, subgroup analyses were only conducted for overall cancer. In that analysis, it was also observed that subjects with high educational level show a weaker inverse association between healthy lifestyle score (HLS) and cancer risk, as compared to those with lower education levels [9]. Also regarding overall cancer, subgroup analyses in a recent Canadian cohort study showed only inverse associations with healthy lifestyle score (HLS) for participants without chronic conditions at baseline [42].",53dce3c0-6d2a-45ac-8072-2debf0757942
43,discussion7," In the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS), no interaction was observed with history of chronic diseases at baseline for esophageal or gastric cancer.  As expected from previous work [8, 12, 21, 35, 36], the component risk factors showed varying associations with esophageal and gastric cancer risk, after mutual adjustment for the remaining components, with notable differences between subtypes. While smoking was positively associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA), BMI was positively associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) risk. Alcohol was positively, and physical activity inversely associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk. Adherence to MD was inversely related to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk and all gastric cancer types. These associations are largely in line with the literature [8, 35, 36, 47].",99a31e04-8f3b-4e01-8087-4e035b32a35a
44,discussion8," Whereas a significant inverse association between physical activity and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) was seen in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS), the few previous studies that reported about physical activity and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) found mixed results [48–50].  The combined healthy lifestyle score (HLS) was significantly associated with all (sub)types except esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS), but the strength of the associations varied, probably reflecting the relative importance of these component risk factors in the etiology of the various subtypes. Also after excluding smoking, the healthy lifestyle score (HLS) still showed inverse associations in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS), as was found before for overall esophageal and gastric cancer [17, 18].",ade7e843-41a9-4a56-b57b-6e90ead90889
45,discussion9,"  The Rate Advancement Periods (rate advancement period (RAP)s) found in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) suggests potentially delayed risks of developing esophageal or gastric cancer (subtypes) when adopting a healthy lifestyle. The rate advancement period (RAP)s per 1-point increase in healthy lifestyle score (HLS) varied from − 11.75 years for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) to − 2.85 years for gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS). Only one other cohort study reported rate advancement period (RAP)s for a healthy lifestyle score (HLS) combining smoking, alcohol, diet, BMI and physical activity in China [15], and found a lower rate advancement period (RAP) of − 1.71 per point increase for gastric cancer, compared to − 3.58 years for gastric cancer observed in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS).",76c19d27-3410-444c-aadb-3fe2404fe3b4
46,discussion10," The rate advancement period (RAP) estimates the time period by which the risk of cancer could be postponed by adhering to the combined healthy lifestyle. The impact of message to a 60-year-old person with an unhealthy combined lifestyle, that he/she has the same cancer risk as a 70-year-old person with a healthy lifestyle if he/she continues this poor lifestyle (as suggested by a rate advancement period (RAP) estimate of 10 years) might increase motivation to change lifestyles.  For overall gastric cancer, the estimated PAF (30%) associated with adherence to the healthiest lifestyle in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) was within the range of published PAFs for combined lifestyles, which varied from 19% in EPIC [19] to 48% in Singapore Chinese [13]; for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA), published PAFs [13, 19] were higher than in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS).",2534ceac-db46-4d08-b8e0-42a26bc4fe57
47,discussion11," Whereas a PAF of 37% was found for overall esophageal cancer in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS), no other studies were found with published PAFs associated with combined healthy lifestyle score (HLS). For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the estimated PAF of 57% in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) is lower than the published PAF of 76% in the Golestan cohort [20], but they used a combination of strong risk factors specific for that area. The large variation seen in PAFs associated with combined healthy lifestyle score (HLS) from different studies can be due to choice of (the number of) considered risk factors in the combination scores, the scoring system and how extreme the chosen categories for least and most healthy lifestyle were defined, and the distribution of the risk factors in the populations studied. This makes it difficult to compare PAFs from different studies.",503dacb5-9d88-4440-8c2a-e714d7fc3e86
48,discussion12,"  The prospective design and high completeness of follow-up of the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) make information bias and selection bias unlikely. Exclusion of cases diagnosed within the first two years of follow-up also did not change the results. The large cohort with long follow-up enabled cancer subtype-specific analyses. However, case numbers for several subtypes were still low, necessitating combined analyses for men and women to increase the statistical power. The Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) also has some limitations. Although we adjusted for a large number of potential confounders, residual confounding by unmeasured factors may still exist. For example, no data were available regarding Helicobacter pylori infection, which might have confounded the results in particular for gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA).",fdf1133e-e3e8-4829-a18a-c3681d3121b6
49,discussion13," The validation study of the food frequency questionnaire has shown that it performs relatively well [27], but measurement error may still have attenuated associations. Because there was no possibility to update dietary intake or other lifestyle data during follow-up, this may have resulted in some attenuated associations too.  In conclusion, this cohort study showed that adhering to a combined healthy lifestyle is rather strongly inversely related to the risk of esophageal and gastric cancer (subtypes). The rate advancement period (RAP)s per 1-point increase in the healthy lifestyle score varied from − 11.75 years for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) to − 2.85 years for gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS). This suggests that important gains in preventing esophageal or gastric cancer can be made by adhering to a healthy lifestyle.
