0,methods0," We performed a literature search in the electronic databases PubMed and Medline, focusing on COVID-19 and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). For such purposes, a combination of the following keywords (MeSH) was used: “gestational diabetes mellitus”, “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, and “micronutrients”. Only publications in English were considered. We also manually searched through the references of the selected publications for additional relevant articles and included them in our review. We focused mainly on meta-analysis, randomized controlled trials, and large prospective or retrospective cohort studies. As the present article is considered an expert review, we did not perform a systematic review of the literature.  3. Current Evidence on the Association between COVID-19 and Diabetes in Pregnancy  Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has increased compared to previous years [43,44,45].",2598cafb-e03f-4e8d-ad60-263d1855803f
1,methods1," Different theories regarding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in relation to the occurrence of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have been proposed, including an increase in cases of newly diagnosed Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or failure to comply with the first-line treatment for Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) due to worsening hyperglycemia (see next section).  The entry point of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells is the ACE2 receptor [33]. SARS-CoV-2 uses a highly glycosylated spike protein to bind to the cell surface ACE2 receptor, a cell receptor that is also glycosylated [34]. Notably, increased glycosylation in a variety of cells and tissues is frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus, which may facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell [46]. ACE2 receptors are expressed in the cells of most organs and tissues, including the pancreatic islet cells, and are overexpressed in patients with diabetes mellitus [47].",084bd210-8816-4638-9cc6-1058dcbf39de
2,methods2," When SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor, the ACE2 pathway is activated, causing acute ß-cell dysfunction and leading to a hyperglycemic state, which may increase the severity of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or promote the de novo onset of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [33,35,48]. A continuous hyperglycemic state also increases viral replication and suppresses the antiviral immune response in the pregnant tissues, such as pulmonary epithelial cells [49,50].  Currently, the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 is well understood and can explain why pregnant women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are more likely to acquire COVID-19 compared to healthy mothers [37,38,42] and even to mothers with other comorbidities, such as cardiac diseases, hypertension, or asthma [38]. Additionally, it also explains the increased hospitalization rates for COVID-19 observed in mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [51].",c5ba69b4-86a2-4c25-812f-eff92c20c025
3,methods3," Notably, hyperglycemia at the time of hospital admission for COVID-19 has been associated with worse prognosis in pregnant patients with diabetes [39]. Nevertheless, there is an open question regarding new-onset Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) secondary to COVID-19 and its implications during pregnancy. Data on this subject is lacking, and no conclusions can currently be made. Further research is warranted to evaluate whether the outcome of pregnancies complicated by new-onset Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) alone differs from that of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 and new-onset Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  Severe COVID-19 is caused by an excessive and aberrant cytokine storm as a result of a rapid increase in proinflammatory cytokines, which is driven by an exaggerated host immune response [52]. One of the most important cytokines is interleukin 6 (IL-6), whose levels correlate with the severity of COVID-19 [53,54].",f12eecb2-0dae-42a5-9b5b-0e43835847ba
4,methods4," One of the main sources of proinflammatory cytokines is adipose tissue [55]. Increased adipose tissue promotes macrophage infiltration and the increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and IL-6 [56]. Elevated levels of IL-6 are also associated with insulin resistance, hyperglycemia [57], and obesity as well as with diabetes mellitus and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [56,57,58,59]. As a result, pregnant women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), especially with a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) > 25 kg/m2, are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 and being admitted to an intensive care unit [10,37,39,40].  In summary, data support the notion that mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at high risk of being hospitalized due to COVID-19 and developing a severe form of the disease, especially if obesity is also present.",4703e3c7-4d39-4f4d-a3a1-746cbdc5f9cc
5,methods5," Good glycemic control may have beneficial effects on clinical outcomes in patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and COVID-19.  4. Gestational Diabetes Treated with Diet and COVID-19  Overall, 80% of women diagnosed with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) can maintain glycemic control through dietary advice and lifestyle modifications [31,60]. This might not hold true for patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and COVID-19, as the rates of patients treated only with diet modifications have been shown to be lower (approximately 60%) [39].  Dietary modification is the first-line treatment for Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The Mediterranean diet, which consists mainly of vegetables, legumes, nuts, cereals, and fish, is effective in improving glycemic control and reducing the risk of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and associated adverse outcomes [58,61].",31f7015b-6c75-447c-9f86-d6c99d07d0c1
6,methods6," In detail, the Mediterranean diet has been associated with lower weight gain during pregnancy [62] and an improvement in short- [63,64,65] and long-term maternal and fetal outcomes [66,67,68,69] in patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Conversely, the Western diet, which is characterized by a high consumption of sugars, proteins, and saturated fats, is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, the activation of the innate immune system, and the impairment of adaptive immunity [58]. The latter two conditions lead to chronic inflammation and impaired host defense against viruses, such as COVID-19, and can be counted among the risk factors for severe disease [70]. Containment measurements adopted during the epidemic waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as lockdowns, led to an increase in the consumption of sugary food and snacks, leading to poor glycemic control in women [71,72,73] and hence potentially worsening maternal and fetal outcomes.",5dee32d0-bb3b-4af9-af71-195c6586a855
7,methods7,"  Another important topic to discuss when addressing nutrition in patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is nutrient deficiency. Deficiencies in vitamin D, vitamin E, zinc, and magnesium have been found in mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and are associated with chronic low-level inflammation and oxidative stress [74,75,76,77]. Available data from one meta-analysis involving 12 randomized controlled studies found that vitamin and mineral supplementation (vitamin D, vitamin E, magnesium, zinc, calcium, and selenium) improved glycemic control and attenuated low-grade chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [78]. Myo-inositol, a sugar found in grains, corn, nuts, meat, legumes, and fresh citrus fruits, has also been associated with a reduction in the incidence of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and fetal macrosomia in normal and overweight/obese mothers [79,80,81].",5829eb71-0fa9-4acf-a6af-c7690c5e7203
8,methods8," Myo-inositol reduces serum glucose and improves insulin sensitivity [82] in a similar way to metformin [83]. Recently, a lot of emphasis has been placed on the use of probiotics for the prevention of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [84]. Probiotics have the ability to modify the intestinal microflora, increasing the degradation of polysaccharides [85], and secrete proinflammatory mediators, reducing local and systemic inflammation [86]. A randomized controlled trial [85] and a subsequent meta-analysis [87] reported the reduced frequency of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in patients receiving probiotics. Although data regarding micronutrients/probiotics and COVID-19 are lacking, deficiencies in the aforementioned micronutrients might be associated with poor glycemic control and low-grade chronic inflammation, both of which might facilitate progression to severe disease [49,50,53,54].",7cf039a5-cf2b-411f-aee7-b8520b08ff94
9,methods9," According to the available evidence, it is important to offer dietary advice to all pregnant patients, especially those with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and a high body mass index (BMI). Overall, a good dietary approach involving a Mediterranean diet and micronutrient/probiotic supplementation might have the potential to reduce the risk of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), SARS-CoV-2 infection, and severe COVID-19. More research is needed in this area to determine the real benefit of micronutrient and probiotic supplementation in patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and COVID-19. A summary of the most important dietary interventions is shown in Figure 1.  Lifestyle modifications including physical activity are also among the first-line options for tackling Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and poor glycemic control in women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).",579faba3-f4ec-4015-8bbb-cd19fee15f65
10,methods10," In women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), physical activity has been shown to improve glucose control and reduce insulin use [88,89], especially when combined with dietary modifications [90]. As mentioned above, one of the measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic that had a negative impact on the prevalence of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was lockdowns [43]. Lockdown periods led to unhealthy diets and reduced physical activity in some individuals [91,92], resulting in a rise in insulin resistance, total body fat, abdominal fat, and inflammatory cytokines [93]. Moreover, mothers suffered from psychological stress, depression, and anxiety during quarantine, which contributed further to the increase in unhealthy diets and the reduction in physical activity, worsening the rates of hyperglycemia [92].",c61284c6-7dac-46ed-a0ea-5c7cd42c1e4f
11,methods11," These COVID-19-related containment measurements led to increased HbA1c concentrations [72] and poor glycemic control [73,94], which might also explain the increasing rates of insulin use among mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic.  Mothers with a normal body mass index (BMI) and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on diet treatment are not at higher risk of contracting or developing symptomatic COVID-19 compared to women with pregnancies that are not complicated by Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [37]. Conversely, overweight or obese mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on diet treatment have a 35% higher risk of developing a symptomatic disease [37]. However, this is not reflected in the maternal or neonatal outcomes, as mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on diet treatment maintain good glycemic control.",1ffffd2f-2883-49fb-883b-b446bbc42047
12,methods12," This might explain the low rates of maternal and neonatal complications, especially in patients with a body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2. However, it is important to underline that the available evidence is limited, and the studies so far published may not have been capable of detecting significant changes in adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution, especially when counseling and treating a pregnant patient with overweight or obesity and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), as obesity alone is an acknowledged risk factor for severe COVID-19 [42,95].  To date, evidence regarding adverse maternal and neonatal complications in patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treated with diet and lifestyle modifications is still lacking. Research in this area should be encouraged in order to better understand the prognosis of these patients (especially those with a higher body mass index (BMI)) when affected by COVID-19.  5.",510ed8de-62ce-4832-b770-ca86ac0e4e75
13,methods13," Gestational Diabetes Treated with Insulin Therapy and COVID-19  The use of insulin in patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is recommended when glycemic control is not achieved within two weeks of diet and lifestyle intervention treatment [31,32]. Good glycemic control has been shown to reduce maternal and perinatal morbidity in pregnancies complicated by Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and COVID-19 [33,34,35,48,49,50]. However, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there has been a 30% increase in the use of insulin to control glycemia in patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared to previous years [39,94]. This is likely due to the effect of lockdowns on physical activity and diet, resulting in an increase in serum glucose levels [91,92].  Evidence on the occurrence of complications associated with COVID-19 in pregnant patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treated with insulin is limited.",a4ca7731-39c5-4b2a-8a1a-3ab2e315d637
14,methods14," Similarly to non-pregnant individuals with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin [96,97], mothers affected by Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) who are on insulin are also more likely to have a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection irrespective of their body mass index (BMI) [37].  Patients affected by COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus type 2 treated with insulin are at increased risk of developing severe/critical complications or dying [98]. Similarly, mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on insulin treatment may undergo a more severe course of the disease and develop adverse maternal outcomes, especially if they are overweight or obese [39]. The mechanisms underlying this association are yet to be fully understood. One hypothesis is that insulin may increase the levels of proinflammatory cytokine from activated macrophages and promote a proinflammatory state, which may exacerbate the inflammation cascade caused by COVID-19 [99].",a26abeef-b8e8-4b44-be42-932cc91e40cc
15,methods15," Another hypothesis is that insulin may increase the susceptibility to lung inflammation [100] and hence may worsen the pulmonary complications associated with COVID-19. Regarding neonatal outcomes, data from the German COVID-19 registry (COVID 19 registry (CRONOS)) showed an almost five-fold increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes in mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treated with insulin with a normal body mass index (BMI). On the contrary, treatment with insulin in overweight or obese mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has not been shown to be independently associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. It is important to note, however, that the incidence of adverse neonatal outcomes in this group was two-times higher than in mothers with no Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and a normal body mass index (BMI) (25.0% vs. 12.3%); therefore, the limited number of cases so far reported may have led to a false negative result.",3f43066c-5f05-40f8-ae5e-c567f512715a
16,methods16,"  Most of the data on the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with pregnancies complicated by diabetes and taking insulin is lacking. Only one study has compared maternal and neonatal outcomes in mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and insulin treatment. Therefore, caution is needed before reaching conclusions regarding the progression of the disease in this population. Patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and insulin treatment should be considered high-risk patients, especially when characterized by a high body mass index (BMI), and should be monitored closely, as this population has been shown to be affected more often by severe COVID-19. Moreover, vaccination and protective measurements against COVID-19 should be recommended, especially to this subgroup of patients.  6.",e1bb51a4-7150-479c-9438-fb063ca5a302
17,methods17," Gestational Diabetes Treated with Metformin and COVID-19  The use of metformin in patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is recommended when they fail to achieve glycemic goals with diet and lifestyle interventions [101,102,103]. These recommendations are based on randomized clinical trials [104] and meta-analyses [105,106], which have shown similar outcomes when compared to patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treated with insulin.  There is no data regarding maternal or perinatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treated with metformin. Available information on the outcomes of COVID-19 in patients treated with metformin pertains to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. As above, several theories have been proposed to explain the association between insulin and adverse outcomes [99,100].",7142d93d-03b8-4a72-9d2f-9c45f3161672
18,methods18," Moreover, the key molecular target of metformin is 5’-AMP-activated protein kinase, which mediates the expression and stability of ACE2 receptors [107,108]. The underexpression or instability of ACE2 receptors may impair the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. Another hypothesis is related to the reduction in the levels of TNF-α that has been associated with the administration of metformin [109,110], which suggests that the drug has anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, it is plausible that pregnancies treated with metformin instead of insulin are at a lower risk of adverse outcomes and COVID-19-related mortality [111,112,113,114]. Further studies are needed to clarify the interaction between metformin and the expression of ACE2 receptors, which is key for the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells.",9eb68d59-4b56-498f-89f3-970b493230f3
19,methods19," Notably, current recommendations state that metformin treatment should be stopped in patients with respiratory distress, renal impairment, or heart failure, due to the increased risk of lactic acidosis [115,116].  7. Future Perspectives  In the present expert review, we showed that dietary and lifestyle modifications during pregnancy provide a window of opportunity for healthcare professionals to reduce the risk of developing Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, there is no evidence as to how these interventions might impact the course of COVID-19 infection and its related outcomes in patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  Substantial evidence regarding maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant patients affected by COVID-19 and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), especially according to the type of treatment, is lacking. This information is critical for counseling patients affected by these two conditions.",edacac08-8bf2-4c6b-b95e-9df3175de0eb
20,methods20," Understanding whether metformin could be a potential alternative to insulin in mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), especially with a higher body mass index (BMI), is a subject of further research given that insulin use has been associated with a progression to severe disease.  8. Conclusions  In summary, the available data suggest that pregnant women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at increased risk of adverse outcomes when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Dietary modifications seem to be the easiest and most reliable way to maintain glycemic control and improve immune function, hence decreasing the risk of COVID-19 and its sequelae in women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Moreover, physical activity might further improve glycemic control and reduce insulin resistance. These approaches have the potential to reduce the severity of the adverse outcomes caused by COVID-19.",9705d670-26e9-46af-b217-f23ddb1198ed
21,methods21," Mothers with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) under insulin treatment are at increased risk of adverse outcomes, especially in cases of overweight or obesity. Therefore, pregnant patients with diabetes mellitus or obesity should be regarded as a high-risk population susceptible to severe COVID-19 disease. The use of insulin appears to be associated with negative effects in patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but this seems to be related to the deeper impairment of the metabolic control of such patients and not to the use of the insulin per se. Metformin might be used as an alternative to insulin in patients with COVID-19; however, more studies are needed before this drug treatment can replace insulin therapy.
