2,introduction2," In healthy individuals, increased dietary nitrate consumption has been shown to reduce the oxygen cost of skeletal muscle work during submaximal exercise, implying increased metabolic efficiency (4-8); in clinical settings, a regime of dietary nitrate supplementation improved exercise performance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and muscle contractile function in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (9, 10). However, each of these studies was limited by their small sample size. The recent, comparatively large, INDIE (Inorganic Nitrite Delivery to Improve Exercise Capacity) trial (utilizing inhaled nitrite) showed no benefit on exercise capacity in HFpEF (11). It is unclear whether the smaller studies were false positives, or whether the shorter plasma half-life of the inhaled nitrite approach failed to work because of the pulsatile rather than sustained nature of elevation of nitrite.",2615cfd5-e796-4674-8823-ba46bb60e8bb
3,introduction3,"  Oral inorganic nitrate ingestion has also been documented to lower blood pressure (5, 12-14), and nitrite has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation (15, 16), promote vasodilation (17), ameliorate pulmonary hypertension (18-20), and attenuate cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury in experimental models (21, 22).  The physiological mechanisms underlying these apparent improvements in metabolic efficiency are not well understood. It has been proposed that ingestion of inorganic nitrate can improve mitochondrial coupling efficiency (i.e., the relationship between mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation) via reduced expression of proteins believed to facilitate mitochondrial proton leak [e.g., the ADP/ATP carrier proteins (AACs) and uncoupling proteins (uncoupling protein (UCP)s)] (6). However, recent work has cast doubt on these findings. Whitfield et al.",ea5abdf4-664a-415e-a406-ae3e95af7aaa

(24) demonstrated improved hemodynamics with no change in cardiac mitochondrial coupling efficiency in response to oral sodium nitrate (24). An alternative mechanism would entail a shift in the Randle cycle [see Hue and Taegtmeyer (25) for a review] away from fatty acids toward glucose utilization with increased coupling of glycolysis to carbohydrate oxidation, which would be accompanied by increased efficiency with respect to oxygen consumption. Previous work has reported that inorganic nitrate is capable of increasing skeletal muscle glucose utilization in the context of type 2 diabetes (26, 27).  The aforementioned studies have largely focused on investigating sodium nitrate supplementation, as opposed to sodium nitrite, the putative “active principle” of inorganic nitrate.",629bf8cc-6efd-4092-856e-e9869e622109

Adherence to a Mediterranean diet reduces the incidence and severity of coronary artery disease, whereas supplementation with nitrate can improve submaximal exercise performance.

27,results6,"  The effect of sodium nitrate or nitrite supplementation on murine mitochondrial protein expression and phosphorylation status The mitochondrial proteins AAC (also known as the adenine nucleotide translocases) and uncoupling protein (UCP) have been implicated in the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential by facilitating futile proton leak (34, 35). Sodium nitrate supplementation has been reported to improve mitochondrial energetic efficiency through decreased expression of AAC and uncoupling protein (UCP)3, in particular (6). However, when investigated we observed no alterations in expression of these proteins in skeletal muscle in response to supplementation with either sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite (Figure 3).

Sodium nitrite supplementation has also been reported to attenuate fatty acid utilization by mitochondria (27). By extension and according to the Randle cycle (25), a reciprocal boost in glucose utilization and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex activity may be expected to occur. Activity through the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is regulated through phosphorylation of 3 distinct serine residues (serines 232, 293, and 300), with decreased phosphorylation of these sites corresponding to increased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. The effects of sodium nitrate or nitrite supplementation in mice on pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphorylation status in skeletal muscle are summarized in Figure 4.",dd487781-e62e-4ce2-b796-0e140df0fdb0

30,results9,"  The effect of sodium nitrate or nitrite supplementation on murine mitochondrial energetics After observing limited change in protein expression levels, we investigated the impact of both nitrite and nitrate supplementation on mitochondrial efficiency directly by respiratory analysis of isolated mitochondria. As summarized in Figure 5, sodium nitrate supplementation had no effect on mitochondrial respiration associated with proton leak activity (oxygen consumption rate (OCR)s in the presence of oligomycin; Figure 5A, C), coupling efficiency (e.g., the respiratory control ratio; Figure 5B), or respiratory activity in any of the conditions tested. In contrast, sodium nitrite supplementation appeared to decrease mitochondrial activity in the presence of oligomycin (Figure 6).",c02375bd-9687-46aa-a818-185984f0050f
31,results10," However, the respiratory control ratio (Figure 6B) remained unchanged, suggesting that the apparent decrease was due to a general decrease in respiratory activity in all conditions, and was not specific to proton leak (Figure 6C). Further detailed analysis at higher resolution using a Clark-type oxygen electrode in follow-up experiments confirmed that neither proton leak activity (Figure 7A, C), the respiratory control ratio (Figure 7B), nor P:O ratio estimates of mitochondrial efficiency (ATP generated per oxygen consumed; Figure 7D) had changed in response to sodium nitrite supplementation.

42,discussion0,"Numerous studies have reported on improved exercise performance in healthy participants in response to ingestion of inorganic nitrate (4, 5, 7, 13, 14, 36). The inclusion of inorganic nitrate into the diet, whether through dietary sources (e.g., beetroot, spinach) or through other therapeutic avenues (e.g., supplements), has been consistently reported to improve muscle performance (8, 13, 37) and to decrease the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise (4, 5, 7, 14), with no detectable changes in plasma substrate concentrations (7, 14, 36). These improvements in exercise performance have also been observed in cardiovascular diseases such as stable angina (38), and heart failure with either preserved (9) or reduced (10) ejection fraction.",4a1a0eb1-7a6c-40d7-a55f-87eed7e990ab
43,discussion1,"  Based in part on data obtained via near infrared spectroscopy (near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)), as well as unchanged plasma substrate concentrations, it was postulated that the exercise benefits of inorganic nitrate could be attributed to improvements in mitochondrial efficiency, specifically increased coupling of mitochondrial respiration to ATP generation, through decreased expression of AAC and uncoupling protein (UCP)3 and reduced proton leak activity (6). Given the canonical understanding of the entero-salivary circuit for absorption of exogenous nitrates (39, 40), together with the observations regarding NO and mitochondrial respiration (41), these findings provide an attractive mechanism to account for the apparent exercise benefits of inorganic nitrates.",d211e1d0-109b-4e2a-91cd-b43a60886d25
44,discussion2,"  It should be noted that studies using the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique have shown reduced muscle oxygen consumption after ingestion of inorganic nitrate (4), but this is directly related to alterations in regional blood flow (42, 43). This is particularly relevant when considering the known vasodilator properties of nitrite, the putative active component of inorganic nitrate (1, 15, 44-46). Using quantitative fMRI, reductions in muscle oxygen consumption at submaximal exercise with inorganic nitrate were shown to be more prominent in muscles with higher proportions of type 1 fibers, suggesting a mitochondrial, rather than vascular, effect (47). However, previous human studies have observed that oral inorganic nitrate does not alter glucose uptake nor insulin sensitivity (36).",a7040337-73e2-4273-b48e-1ded9beb026f
45,discussion3,"  Importantly, our investigation failed to find any alterations in mitochondrial respiration in response to inorganic nitrite, nor were any changes in expression of the proteins AAC1, AAC2, or uncoupling protein (UCP)3 observed in either human or murine skeletal muscle tissue. Indeed, recent work by others has also cast doubt on the idea that inorganic nitrate improves mitochondrial respiratory efficiency: whereas there was a slight reduction in whole body oxygen consumption, Whitfield et al. (23) observed no changes in mitochondrial respiration or uncoupling protein (UCP) content in response to inorganic nitrate (ingested as beetroot juice) (23). Furthermore, we found no substantive changes in the phosphorylation status of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, nor any increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity.",c0cb9edc-99ec-40e0-a671-7052e4319929
46,discussion4," As such, there is now a growing body of evidence to indicate that previously observed exercise benefits in response to inorganic nitrate/nitrite are unlikely due to improvements in mitochondrial oxygen efficiency.

48,discussion6," Lastly, this investigation does not address the possibility of divergent effects between dietary nitrate and dietary nitrite supplementation: dietary nitrate supplementation was observed to reduce whole body oxygen consumption (while leaving the respiratory exchange ratio and indexes of glucose handling unchanged), yet infusion with sodium nitrite failed to demonstrate the same effects (36). These results were replicated to an extent in mice and humans (23, 24), where supplementation with nitrate-rich beetroot juice or sodium nitrate solution also reduced whole body oxygen consumption. These latter studies reported similar results to our own in that they did not observe any reductions in mitochondrial leak nor improvements in mitochondrial coupling efficiency.  The evidence underlying the vascular effects of inorganic nitrate/nitrite remains convincing, however.",356b6d79-f3d9-42e0-8764-44881feda01a
49,discussion7," Hypoxic potentiation of inorganic nitrite as a vasodilator, and its augmentation in the presence of hemoglobin, have been reported previously (15), and similar work has reported a seeming dependence on myoglobin for the vascular effects of nitrite (49). In a clinical study involving chronic HFrEF patients, nitrite infusion resulted in decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance and right atrial pressure, as well as increased stroke volume, correlating with increased estimated transseptal gradient (defined as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure minus right atrial pressure), with alleviation of diastolic ventricular interaction suggested as a likely mechanism (45). Similar effects have also been observed in response to inhaled nitrite in HFpEF patients (50, 51). Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the vascular effects of nitrite, however, is beyond the scope of the present investigation.",c88e6a87-bb52-4ff9-b4aa-3f53824476df
50,discussion8,"  The therapeutic benefits of inorganic nitrate/nitrite are unlikely to be due to direct modulation of skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism. These results do not preclude that the underlying benefits of inorganic nitrite may be mediated through vascular effects: indeed, modulation of vascular function may even account for previous reports of altered metabolism in response to inorganic nitrate/nitrite.
