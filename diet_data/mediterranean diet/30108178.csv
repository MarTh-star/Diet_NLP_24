0,introduction0,"The Mediterranean diet is a healthy dietary pattern associated with lower risk of cardiometabolic and other noncommunicable diseases (1–3). Despite the strong evidence for the health benefit from observational studies and controlled trials, the mechanisms through which the diet is associated with these disease outcomes are not well understood. Because the dietary pattern is characterized by diverse dietary factors including high consumption of vegetables, legumes, and fish; moderate consumption of fruits, cereals, nuts, eggs, dairy, white meat, and wine; and low consumption of red meat, processed meat, potato, and sweets (4), the diet is likely to influence disease outcomes via diverse pathways related to the different dietary factors (5–8).  The pathophysiology of noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, or cancer may involve processes of chronic metabolite imbalance (9).",e0f46380-6ee6-4f38-8426-e622ab6a77de
1,introduction1," Many small molecules in pathophysiologic processes can be profiled with metabolomics assays in blood, urine, and other tissues according to recent technological advancement (10, 11). Studies in the last few years, for example, have identified potential metabolomic biomarkers for type 2 diabetes, related to mechanisms of amino acids and lipid metabolism (10, 12). The metabolites are also influenced by environmental determinants including diet (13, 14). Research on diet, metabolites, and disease risk assessed simultaneously is promising to enhance understanding of how single dietary components or adherence to an overall dietary pattern influence disease risk (15). In addition, metabolomics may help identify objective markers of dietary intakes of foods or dietary patterns, or at least supplement traditional self-reported methods, because self-reported measurement of dietary exposure tends to involve misclassification (16). Single biomarkers (e.g.",140ff80e-4771-4c7e-abec-de9e82bc625b
2,introduction2,", vitamins, fatty acids) also may not capture a complex dietary exposure (17, 18), and previous evidence showed the utility of a combination of biomarkers in capturing different types of food intake within a diet (19).  The effects of the Mediterranean diet on individual metabolite concentrations were evaluated in 2 studies in Spain (20–23): in substudies of the Prevencíon con Dieta Mediterránea (Prevencíon con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED)) trial, which included adults with high risk of cardiovascular diseases; and in the Metabolic Syndrome Reduction in Navarra (Reduction in Navarra (RESMENA)) trial, which recruited individuals with a high mean BMI (36.1 kg/m2). No study to our knowledge has yet assessed how metabolites in combination would mediate the association of the Mediterranean diet with cardiometabolic risk factors in a general population.",ae70e2c9-1ce8-4fb8-b8de-2d5f8e7b1bf4
3,introduction3," We conducted the current study evaluating targeted metabolomics data from 10,806 adults without diabetes in the Fenland Study in the United Kingdom, with the hypotheses that 1) adherence to the Mediterranean diet would be associated with plasma metabolites and cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pressure, lipid concentrations, measures of insulin resistance, and glucose concentrations); and 2) the association of adherence to the Mediterranean diet with cardiometabolic risk factors would be at least partly explained by a set of metabolites. We further examined whether the set of metabolites as a composite biomarker score was correlated with adherence to the Mediterranean diet. ",d7c49638-64e0-4907-96aa-5a75a2309e7f

5,methods0,"Study population The Fenland Study is a general population cohort which recruited 12,435 participants via general practices from 3 centers (Cambridge, Ely, Wisbech) in Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom (12, 24). Recruitment occurred between 2005 and 2015, and participants were eligible if they were born between 1950 and 1975. To investigate adults at risk of developing diabetes, adults with known diabetes were not considered eligible. Other exclusion criteria included pregnancy, an inability to walk unaided, psychosis, or terminal illness. All participants attended a single clinic visit during which they completed an FFQ and a general health and lifestyle questionnaire, and had blood samples and anthropometric measures taken by trained staff. The study was approved by the Health Research Authority Committee East of England—Cambridge Central and all participants gave written informed consent.",789ef9e8-90b1-4195-84a6-067226b940af
6,methods1,"  Dietary assessment Dietary assessment was by a 130-item semiquantitative FFQ which assessed dietary intake over the past year. The FFQ was previously examined for validity against 16-d weighed records, 24-h recall, and selected biomarkers (25, 26). There were 9 possible categories of intake frequencies, ranging from “never or less than once per month” to “6+ per day” for a standard food portion size. The reported frequency of intakes were converted into nutrients and dietary intakes as previously described (27). After dietary intakes were adjusted to a 2000-kcal/d (8.37-MJ/d) diet using the residual method, we calculated the Mediterranean diet score (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)) representing the adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pyramid as previously described (2, 4).",66b87d0d-1a29-449f-80fd-59c3bb8a6cad
7,methods2," Briefly, we derived 15 dietary components (vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, cereals, dairy, fish, red meat, processed meat, white meat, egg, potato, sweets, alcohol, and olive oil) from the Mediterranean dietary pyramid and assigned continuous scores from 0 to 1 for each component (possible range: 0–15) according to the participant's level of adherence to the recommendation (Supplemental Table 1). Content validity of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) was confirmed with the inverse association with incident cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality in our previous work (2).  Targeted metabolomics Participants were instructed to fast for 10 h before their appointment time for the collection of fasting blood samples upon arrival, from which plasma samples were divided into aliquots.",e790b7e9-1193-4976-b7ef-b79d307f857a
8,methods3," Using LC electrospray ionization and flow-injection analysis tandem MS, targeted metabolomics for 188 metabolites from the fasting plasma was performed at the Medical Research Council Human Nutrition Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom, using the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ® p180 kit (28, 29) as reported in our prior publication (12) and in the Supplemental Text. Briefly, samples were derivatized and extracted using a Hamilton STAR liquid handling station (Hamilton Robotics Ltd) and analyzed using a Waters-Acquity ultra-performance LC (Waters Ltd) system coupled to an ABSciex 5500 Qtrap mass spectrometer (Sciex Ltd). Data were processed in the Biocrates MetIDQ software. Metabolites included acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, hexoses, phospholipids, and sphingolipids (12). Routine quality controls were performed in comparison to other laboratories using the same approach as described previously and in the Supplemental Text (30).",701f7bee-0aaa-448e-bbd5-1f0081106d6f
9,methods4,"  Of the 192 metabolites captured by the assay, 17 were excluded based on a prespecified exclusion criterion of >5% of participants showing peaks lower than the limit of quantification, because these measures were considered invalid [histamine, asymmetric dimethylarginine, carnosine, dihydroxyphenylalanine, dopamine, nitro-tyrosine, putrescine, spermine, 3 acylcarnitines (OH-C4, OH-C5, OH-C6, and C6), phosphatidylcholine diacyl 30:2, and 4 sphingomyelins (OH-24:1, 22:3, 26:0, and 26:1)]. For the current analyses, we evaluated 175 metabolites, including 40 acylcarnitines or carnitine, 35 amino acids or biogenic amines, total hexoses, 88 glycerophospholipids (14 acylated lysophosphatidylcholines, 74 phosphatidylcholines), and 11 sphingomyelins.

BMI was calculated as kg/m2. Physical activity was measured objectively using a combined heart rate monitor and movement sensor (Actiheart, CamNTech) which participants wore continuously for 6 d and 6 nights (32). Insulin, glucose, and blood lipids were measured using a fasting blood sample (Supplemental Text). Concentrations of LDL cholesterol were estimated with the Friedewald formula (33). HOMA-IR was calculated as insulin (milliunits per liter) times glucose (millimoles per liter) divided by 22.5 (34). Two-hour postload glucose (2-h glucose) was obtained after a standard oral-glucose-tolerance test using a 75-g glucose drink.

11,methods6," Unless corrected for multiple testing, α was 0.05. Missing covariates were imputed with multiple imputation (10 imputed data sets) (35), and the extent of missing information was <5.5% for all covariates. All analyses were based on 1 of the 10 imputed data sets, after confirming little variance across data sets. Missing information on metabolites existed because of exclusion of a few batches, and therefore analyses for different metabolites varied in sample sizes. Undetectable peaks of metabolites were replaced with a random value between the batch-specific minimum value and 0.1 times the batch-specific minimum value. To minimize the influence of outliers, the variables were winsorized using cutoffs based on the batch-specific mean plus or minus 5 times the batch-specific SD. Batch correction was then applied to control for variability (batch-specific means and SDs) across laboratory batches (27).",9a28141f-4848-412d-aeb5-f9abec642977
12,methods7,"  All the 175 metabolites were log transformed to improve normality of distribution and to allow interpretation of relative differences in each metabolite per SD difference in the Mediterranean diet score (MDS). Linear regressions were fitted to model each of the 175 plasma metabolites as a dependent variable and standardized Mediterranean diet score (MDS) as an independent variable. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders including age, sex, test site, education level, occupation, income, smoking, physical activity, energy expenditure, medication use, family history of diabetes, BMI, and waist circumference. Significant associations were then identified, based on the α corrected for the false discovery rate (36). Considering that anthropometric measures may be mediators or outcomes of diet–metabolite associations, we repeated the analyses for the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and the metabolites without adjustment for anthropometric measures (BMI and waist circumference).",f785bde0-fd5c-4705-81c2-a22d65c9cf8e
13,methods8,"  To assess whether the metabolites collectively represented adherence to the overall Mediterranean diet, a metabolite score was generated based on the strengths of associations of metabolites with the Mediterranean diet score (MDS). Briefly, 1) we selected the metabolites significantly associated with the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) in the total sample; 2) we fitted a multivariable-adjusted model to predict the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) simultaneously by the selected metabolites using a randomly selected half of the study sample (derivation set); 3) the regression coefficient for each of the selected metabolites was then multiplied as a weight with each metabolite in the second half of the data set (test set); 4) the products were summed to generate a metabolite score in the test set; and 5) the score was standardized to have mean = 0 and SD = 1.",adee1602-c274-4a75-80d1-3df6ea7ae598
14,methods9," The same steps (1–5) were repeated by flipping the derivation and test sets, so that a metabolite score for each participant was derived from an independent sample, i.e., avoiding the problem of “over-optimism” (37, 38).  Additional analyses were performed to confirm the utility and robustness of the metabolite score. As a secondary analysis, plasma vitamin C was examined as a biomarker for its correlation (Spearman's ρ) with the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and the metabolite score to confirm whether the set of metabolites performed better than a single biomarker of diet quality in capturing adherence to the Mediterranean diet. To assess influences of metabolite selection concerning collinearity between metabolites, we repeated the process and derived additional metabolite scores using metabolites selected from a multivariable-adjusted backward stepwise regression to predict the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) (cutoff of P values = 0.01 for entry and 0.05 for removal).",34ffee17-5ee5-4230-9080-85795c5933d2
15,methods10," To examine internal reproducibility of the metabolite score within the Fenland cohort, we defined a derivation set and a test set by age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and study sites (Cambridge, Ely, and Wisbech) separately. In addition, to examine how each individual dietary component contributed to the association of the Mediterranean diet with metabolite concentrations, linear regressions of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with metabolites were repeated sequentially adjusting for each dietary component.",31ee299b-e017-470b-ab1e-95c7ed7e5f8c
16,methods11,"  Analyses to assess influences of metabolites on associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with cardiometabolic risk factors We assessed the influence of metabolites on the association between the Mediterranean diet and cardiometabolic risk factors: systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)), diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)), HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol, triglycerides (log transformed), HOMA-IR, and 2-h glucose.

17,methods12," To assess the degree of influence of the metabolites, the percentage change of regression coefficients of models before and after addition of metabolites was calculated as 100 × [(β0 − β1)/β0], where β0 and β1 represent the association of the Mediterranean diet with each cardiometabolic risk factor before and after adjustment for metabolites assessed as potential mediators (39, 40). We considered the percentage of attenuation of the association between the Mediterranean diet and cardiometabolic risk factors as the degree of mediation due to the metabolites. SEs and CIs for the percentage attenuation were estimated by bootstrapping with 2000 iterations (39). P values were based on a Wald test for an estimate of the percentage divided by the bootstrap SE (α = 0.05). ",792776e8-4366-4bc6-b35a-28dd68b49b86

For example, an increased concentration of lysophosphatidylcholine 18:1 in the Reduction in Navarra (RESMENA) trial might reflect higher consumption of olive oil or other plant-based oils, whereas no significant association in our study may have partly reflected suppression of de novo synthesis of 18:1 due to low consumption of those plant oils on average. The inconsistency highlights the possible importance of specific vegetable oils; moreover, phospholipid subtypes require further investigation in different populations.  Interpretation of findings and implications Although many of the targeted metabolites are known to be synthesized de novo, we found that the combination of 66 metabolites had a moderate correlation of 0.43 with the Mediterranean diet score (MDS).",d8a7a8cd-2afe-4680-9bac-03b2f95b9521
36,discussion6," In contrast, the correlation of plasma vitamin C, a marker of dietary intakes of vitamin C or food groups rich in vitamin C (19), with the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) was 0.26. These findings suggest that our approach using metabolomics could identify a set of small metabolites as a biomarker of adherence to the Mediterranean diet or of overall diet quality. Further research is warranted to establish the utility of the metabolite score in different populations and to test its validity using dietary feeding studies.  The secondary analyses focusing on dietary components showed that, for example, the association of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with acylcarnitines and carnitine attenuated in the regression model adjusted for nuts, cereals, red meats, or processed meats. Acylcarnitines are derivatives of carnitines from mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, and meats are their dietary sources (15, 41). Thus, the findings for red and processed meats are plausible.",c51e9b44-64da-4be1-8975-988593788749
37,discussion7," By contrast, how nuts and cereals could lead to the attenuation of the observed associations is unclear, requiring further research on dietary sources and bioactive elements in nuts and cereals that could determine concentrations of acylcarnitines, which are related to poorer cardiovascular health (42, 43). This indicates that small metabolites reflect both dietary intakes and metabolic states altered by dietary exposure.  Our finding for fish consumption also indicates the potential impact of a single dietary factor on multiple metabolite species. Fish consumption appeared to explain the association of the Mediterranean diet with many phospholipids including phosphatidylcholines, which include lyso-, acyl-aklyl- and diacyl-phosphatidylcholines that are key components of cellular membranes and blood lipoproteins (15, 44). One of the dietary sources of choline is fish (15, 44), and thus our finding is plausible.",1b221737-2798-43be-a377-f48cc50ea640
38,discussion8," Fish consumption also attenuated the inverse associations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and carnitines with long-chain SFAs. This could potentially reflect that fish consumption, for example, supplied dietary PUFAs, thereby suppressing de novo fatty acid synthesis. As well as acyl-carnitines, subtypes of acyl-chains of phospholipids should be studied further.  Our findings from the mediation analysis indicate, under the assumption that the associations were causal, that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet would improve insulin resistance and dyslipidemia and also alter the profile of many circulating metabolites including carnitines, amines, phospholipids, and sphingomyelins. Although causality cannot be determined in this study, these findings suggest that multiple metabolites are involved in the etiology of cardiometabolic diseases and also influenced by the overall dietary pattern.",d3592bd0-3531-4513-bb7e-def3251b542d
39,discussion9,"  Strengths and limitations To our knowledge, our study is the largest study to date examining the association between the Mediterranean diet and metabolite concentrations via a metabolomics approach. With its large sample size, internal cross-validation analysis confirmed the internal validity of the metabolite score. Limitations of our work included the cross-sectional design of the Fenland Study, limiting the interpretation of the causal pathways. For instance, metabolite concentrations could vary as a consequence of the causal effect of the diet on insulin resistance. Although we adjusted for major potential confounders, residual confounding could be present and adjustment for a metabolite in assessing mediation could cause further residual confounding (40). Nonetheless, it is still meaningful that a mechanism of causation, confounding, or both could indeed involve specific small molecules measured by metabolomics.",d753fb8b-ccdb-4d70-b072-3243e94c8b64
40,discussion10," Measurement errors in dietary measures, the metabolomics assays, and covariates could exist and cause both false-positive and false-negative findings for the associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with metabolites.  Another limitation is that our targeted metabolomics assay did not include some molecules relevant to the Mediterranean diet, such as dietary flavonoids. We focused on relative differences in metabolite concentrations by adherence to the Mediterranean diet, although absolute concentrations would potentially be of interest. The assay platform we used also could not differentiate isobaric lipids with identical molecular weights. Acyl-chains of phosphatidylcholine 38:6, for example, could be both a pair of 16:0 and 22:6 (palmitic acid and DHA) and a pair of 18:1 and 20:5 (oleic acid and EPA). Degrees of both chain-length and -saturation influence roles of fat-esterified molecules.",d0a5ace2-7b02-48a6-9ccc-97dc2fcc1ee1
41,discussion11," Therefore, roles of individual phospholipids without information on acyl-chains cannot be interpreted in this study and should be investigated in future work, for example, by using NMR spectroscopy or alternative MS platforms (45, 46). Collinearity between metabolites would be concerning but our cross-validation approach confirmed the robustness of the results derived from a combination of metabolites.  The generalizability of our findings is limited because this study recruited adults without diabetes and mainly adults of European descent (92%). Because the Mediterranean diet is likely to be fit to dietary habits uniquely in different populations in Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries (2, 47), future investigation in other populations is warranted. For example, adherence to the Mediterranean diet observed in our study was not necessarily the same as that in Mediterranean countries, regarding mean consumption of olive oil, nuts, and yogurt.",90a666bb-0cd9-431d-a392-4b2e12bba826
42,discussion12," Previous assessments of Mediterranean diet adherence across different regions have found that Northern European countries including the United Kingdom had lower Mediterranean diet adherence than the Mediterranean countries, but that adherence was also higher in the United Kingdom in the 2000–2003 period than in the 1961–1965 period (48). We also did not differentiate between certain details of Mediterranean diet adherence, for example, on red wine compared with alcohol consumption, because our dietary assessment did not differentiate between red wine and white wine. The difference could influence a combination of metabolites to predict adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Alongside the possibility that different components of the Mediterranean diet could contribute differentially between populations, the lack of replication of our findings in an independent cohort is one of the limitations of our study.",60beb44b-b411-4b8a-9232-fe6c518a2f23
43,discussion13," Confirmatory work would ideally be conducted in both the United Kingdom and other countries.  Conclusions The current findings provide evidence that different subclasses of small metabolites including carnitines, amines, and phospholipids were associated with adherence to the Mediterranean diet, and should prompt the discovery of potential biomarkers or metabolic profiles associated with this dietary pattern. In addition, the results also showed that the associations of the Mediterranean diet with measures of insulin resistance and major lipid profiles were partly explained by metabolites related to the Mediterranean diet, suggesting their involvement in pathways linking diet to disease risk. Overall, these findings advance greater understanding of metabolites as potential dietary biomarkers and help with knowledge on pathways involved in diet–disease etiology.
