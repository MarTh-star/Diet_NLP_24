0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design  This study was designed as a self-administered, cross-sectional, multinational, and observational research to examine the adherence of Arabic-speaking females to the MD and its association with insomnia symptoms. A total of 917 female adults were surveyed using a convenient sample and a validated questionnaire whose answers were evaluated using the MD score tool (MD adherence score) and the Athens Insomnia Scale (Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS)) [37]. In our study, we adopted Trichopoulou et al. and PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) methodology to assess adherence to the traditional MD [38,39]. Beneficial components (vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, cereal, and fish) were given a rating of 0 or 1. Consumption of harmful components was given a score of 1 if less than the median was consumed (meat, poultry, and dairy products, which are seldom non-fat or low-fat).",f0c20b4a-2189-4ed8-9638-a9e8bcfe8777
1,methods1," Accordingly, MD adherence scores varied from <6 (low adherence of the MD) to ≥10 (high MD adherence); a score between 6 to 9 indicated moderate adherence to the MD.  The sample size was estimated for our survey to be around 385 participants, assuming a confidence level of 95% (95% CI) that the real value was within 5.0% (alpha level), and type II error was about 20% of the surveyed values of the female population in the Middle East and North Africa (223,874,467) according to the latest World Bank statistics [3]. In the final analysis, we examined 917 individuals to raise the statistical power to 90 %.  This study was conducted in Jordan, following the “Method for Observational Studies in Nutritional Epidemiology” (STROBE-nut) guidelines to enhance the quality of the study design and report [40].  2.2.",a6d48d62-1c4f-4083-8a1e-058d6f6380d7
2,methods2," Study Setting and Participants  The study included a total of 917 Arabic-speaking female participants of 14 Arab nationalities (Syria, Palestine, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yamen, Lebanon, Algeria, Sudan, Morocco, Libya, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Western Sahara) living in Jordan. The data were collected consecutively between March and May 2021 using convenient self-selection adult sampling. The participants response rate to the online survey was 89.5%, and all questions were answered. The participants were chosen from the general population based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) a female adult over the age of 18, (2) capable of writing and speaking Arabic, (3) willing to give information and volunteer to participate in the study. Participants who did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. Additionally, participants who did not consent or wished to withdraw were excluded from the study.",6b5ce39d-7abb-4d69-8349-ee5ab53856bc
3,methods3,"  Data were collected through an online survey via instant electronic communication using Google forms. The survey was mainly sent through advertisements on social media like WhatsApp, BlackBerry Messenger, Viber, Signal, Line, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. Other recruitment methods were also used using word of mouth, work relationships, and authors’ connections. Moreover, participants were requested to share the link to the questionnaire with additional participants who fit the inclusion criteria via social media. All questions in our survey were translated into Arabic and made as straightforward as possible. Participants who were willing to write about their dietary consumption, symptoms, health, and lifestyle habits were allowed to complete the questionnaire in their spare time. All data were saved in a secure Google Drive, accessible only to the principal investigator and coded for the research team.",e5437143-55fc-4597-86ca-75a0a5c74048
4,methods4,"  Weight and height were obtained from the self-reported questionnaire, and the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was generated accordingly.  2.3. Ethical Approval  This study received ethical approval on the 14th of January 2021 from the Faculty of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of Petra, Amman, Jordan (UOP/REC: 1H/1/2021). It was carried out in conformity with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1964. By signing a consent form, all participants agreed to participate in this study. Participants were able to leave the study at any time without obligation or notice.  2.4. Instrument  The survey comprised three sections of questions. Initially, the participants reported sociodemographic information, anthropometric measurements, educational level, smoking habits, country of origin, and general health status. Then, the participants completed the MD score tool, which comprises of 14 questions, answered with yes or no.",20c4cebe-e400-478e-b5e5-acb386fbe277
5,methods5," The MD includes high levels of protective foods, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish, and olive oil, with moderate red meat and alcohol consumption. The MD emphasizes the consumption of whole or minimally processed foods and a low consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grain products, and processed or energy-dense foods [6,7,8,13,14,15]. A high adherence score of the MD is related to a reduced cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) risk and all-cause mortality.  Finally, in the third section of the survey, the Athens Insomnia Scale (Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS)) was used to diagnose insomnia cases in adults over the previous month [37]. This test has an excellent internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.90).",83108810-cd77-4628-ab9e-106474eaf953
6,methods6," Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) is a self-assessment psychometric instrument based on an eight-item test: the first five items are about sleep induction, night-time awakenings, final awakening, total sleep duration, and sleep quality; the last three items are about well-being, functioning capacity, and daytime sleepiness. Each item is evaluated with a four-point Likert scale. The Arabic validated Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) version [41] was used, which has a high Cronbach’s alpha of about 0.83.  2.5. Statistical Analysis  As part of the data analysis, histograms and box plots were used to identify potential outliers and test the normality of the study variables using the Shapiro–Wilk test. To summarize the data, descriptive statistics were used, including means and standard deviations (for continuous variables) and absolute and relative frequencies (for categorical variables). An insomnia diagnosis can be made based on a score of ≥6 on the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS).",4c9b5000-36a4-47ca-8a23-26548684c1e2
7,methods7," We examined adjusted differences between participants based on insomnia status with the lowest adherence to the Mediterranean diet (score < 6, reference category) and those with moderate and high degrees of adherence (6–9, or ≥10). The analysis of covariance (adherence (6–9 or ≥10) The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)) was performed to detect if there were any statistically significant differences in the means of three or more unrelated groups based on MD categories regarding the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) score.  We also examined the effect size using Cohen’s d. The effect size was estimated via Cohen’s d and was interpreted as follows: 0.20 as small, 0.50 as moderate, ≥0.80 as large. After the omnibus F test, post hoc tests were performed to locate those specific differences. Post hoc comparisons are based on estimated marginal means using Tukey’s correction. We used two-tailed tests, and results with p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",95371329-f3bd-4646-a4e1-398d76bbe15b
8,methods8," All statistical analyses were performed using R for statistical computing 4.0.3.  3. Results  3.1. Study Sample Characteristics  As shown in Table 1, the mean age of the 917 Arabic-speaking female participants was 36 ± 10 years. The average weight of the participants was 63.4 ± 14 kg, and the average height of the women who participated in the study was 161.5 ± 6 cm. Most participants were unemployed (85%) single females (64%) with an undergraduate degree (74%). Almost 86% were non-smokers. More than half of the participants were Jordanians (57%). body mass index (BMI) was normal for 52% of the Arabic-speaking female participants, whereas 26% were overweight, and 12% were obese.  3.2. Mediterranean Diet Adherence Score  As shown in Table 2, One-third of the Arabic-speaking female participants (31%) scored less than 6 for the adherence to the MD, (MD Score < 6).",4be5cb85-efd8-495f-9e1a-585425feb877
9,methods9," Moderate adherence to the MD was shown by 56% of the study participants (MD Score 6–9), whereas high adherence to the MD (scores ≥ 10) was seen for 13% of the study sample.  3.3. Sleep Difficulty  As shown in Table 3, almost half of the participants (52%) reported to sleep between 6 and 8 h a day. At the same time, 43% of them needed an hour to go to sleep. Most study participants reported either to not wake up during the night (41%) or to wake up once (41%). About 88.9% of the participants reported not to wake up earlier or a little earlier than the desired time. Furthermore, the participants reported a satisfactory (47%) or slightly satisfactory (36%) sleep quality, while their degree of comfort during sleeping was satisfactory (48%).  3.4.",c1fb824d-4565-4b64-b018-6b2140ea2b29
10,methods10," Association between Adherence to the MD and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS)  Results from one-way adherence (6–9 or ≥10) The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed a statistically significant difference between MD adherence score categories and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) status, F (2, 914) = 4.03, p = 0.018. Therefore, we rejected the null hypothesis H0, which stated no significant difference between MD scores and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) status. The alternative hypothesis (H1) stated that the existence of a significant difference between MD scores and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) status.  3.5. Post Hoc Analysis for Multiple Comparisons  Among the MD adherence score categories, we found that between groups, MD adherence scores of less than 6 and above 10 had no statistically significant difference. Additionally, there were no statistically significant differences in the MD adherence score for MD score 6–9.",d36baf48-0878-46e2-ac1a-6a20ffebe8a3
11,methods11," Participants who scored >10 alone had better Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), p-value = 0.015. Cohen’s value calculated for the three MD adherence scores indicated a ‘small’ effect size association between all MD adherence scores and the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) status, as shown below.  3.6. Estimated Marginal Means of MD Categories  The model estimated marginal means and standard errors of Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) at the factor level of the different MD adherence categories. Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) was better among participants with an MD adherence score ≥ 10, with a mean increase of 6.02, 95% CI (5.28, 6.76) and was statistically significant (p = 0.015), but no other group differences were statistically significant.  4. Discussion  In our study, 917 Arabic-speaking female adults of 14 Arab nationalities who live in Jordan were included. Half of the participants had a normal body mass index (BMI) (18.5–24.9 kg/m2).",107ee2ea-df37-4e4e-8ee1-c6803e29fc5b
12,methods12," Nonetheless, the adherence to the MD was moderate for 56% of the sample. Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) was better for participants with an MD adherence score ≥ 10, with a mean increase of 6.02, 95% CI (5.28, 6.76) which was statistically significant (p = 0.015), but no other group differences were statistically significant.  Recent research examined the connection between sleep quality and adherence to the MD of Middle Eastern Arab individuals [18,35]. Overall, sleep quality was significantly linked to a healthy diet [42,43,44]. Few studies have previously examined the connection between MD adherence and sleep parameters in adults [42,43]. A research study enrolled 1500 Spanish seniors for almost 3 years, measuring sleep duration and sleep quality markers [42]. According to the researchers, people who followed the MD had a reduced chance of changing their sleep routine and had better sleep quality [42].",799bf992-c7f0-4d6f-9120-b463fb8aae37
13,methods13," Another research found that adhering to the MD helped to improve sleep issues, including insomnia symptoms [43]. Several studies investigated the general connection between sleep length and diet quality [44,45,46,47,48], while others addressed sleep patterns and eating behaviors such as skipping meals, eating too little, eating meals at irregular times, and snacking between meals [6,7,8,9,10,45,46,47,48]. Experimental research has proven that high-quality diets enhance sleep duration, while sleep deprivation has been shown to increase the desire for high-calorie meals [6,10,43,44,45,46,47,48].  The MD tends to include high amounts of fruits, vegetables, seafood, whole grains, and olive oil, while minimizing meat, dairy, and alcohol [1]. It has also been suggested that better sleep and better mental health are linked to the MD [45,46].",ecac39dd-9e70-4929-99f8-31417258502b
14,methods14," Bioactive substances like antioxidants and anti-inflammatory components of the MD may serve as neurological protective agents, decreasing oxidative damage and brain ischemia [40]. Indeed, during sleep deprivation, elevated oxidative processes have been observed in many human internal organs like the liver, the brain, and the heart. Neurological inflammation was suggested to have a direct relationship to poor sleep [37,41,44]. Additional data also evidenced the role of some vitamins, specifically vitamin D and vitamin C, which may have a direct relationship to better sleep for either sleep length or sleep quality [47]. In addition, poor mental health is correlated with low levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the diet [47]. Other studies emphasized the role of exercise, sleep, and dietary habits in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as cognitive dysfunction [2,3,48,49].",2f7c0f03-dd3d-40c9-b6d4-4179bb7abbad
15,methods15," Many components of the MD may improve the structural and functional brain plasticity whose deficit is associated with Alzheimer’s disease [48,49].  Overweight people may develop sleep apnea, which leads to poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, which is proven to be positively associated with obesity [49,50,51]. Some new research has shown that sleep apnea may cause blood vessel problems, affecting cognition and leading to death and illness [52].  Strength and Limitations  To our knowledge, no previous study was conducted to assess the link between Mediterranean diet adherence and insomnia among Arabic-speaking women in Jordan. We collected data from 917 female participants of Jordanian nationality as well as of 14 Arab nationalities using a validated MD adherence score [39,40] and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) questionnaire [1]. Our findings showed that high MD adherence was linked significantly to improved sleep. Insomnia affects women more than men, also in the 21st century.",28cb2e43-1526-42aa-8e7f-93bf466449cb
16,methods16," Some women are simultaneously caring for children and aging parents. Women may also work outside the house while caring for others. These activities may affect women’s sleep. In addition, hormonal changes in women’s life phases may impact sleep quality. For example, women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)), a severe type of PMS, are more prone to sleeplessness. During pregnancy, women may experience severe leg or stomach pain. Menopausal women often suffer from sleeplessness owing to hot flashes and excessive perspiration. Women are also more prone to mood disorders like worry and sadness, making sleep issues more prevalent. Finally, women are more likely to be primary caregivers. Therefore, conducting this study on women is one of the strengths of this work, due to the lack of specific studies in the Middle East region.  The multi-ethnic features of the examined population represent a snapshot of each Middle Eastern country.",54ccbbbd-137e-4b4f-89d1-d5aa99707472
17,methods17," This strengthens our study, capturing diverse characteristics of dietary intake. The limitation of our study is related to its cross-sectional design and the fact that it was based on a self-reported questionnaire on MD and insomnia, subjected to memory and social desirability biases. These instruments were extensively researched, and the methodologies employed in this study are nearly the same as those used in previous studies. Nonetheless, this study was performed in Jordan and as such it is not representative of the entire geographical area of the Middle East. In addition, the study participants were females, which further limits the generalizability of the results. The low causality of this type of study and the use of bivariate descriptive analysis also limit the generalizability of our findings.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, our findings provide preliminary evidence that participants’ adherence to the MD was significantly associated with better sleep.",65c44615-d9f6-4f02-b933-db0b51ac801e
18,methods18," We also wish to emphasize the importance of good nutrition, high adherence to the MD, and a healthy lifestyle in reducing insomnia symptoms amongst Arabic-speaking female adults. It is worth mentioning that other factors may influence insomnia in females, such as advanced age and hormonal changes regarding sex steroids, which were not studied in our research. Therefore, further research is needed to include the role of female sex steroids in insomnia among Arabic-speaking female adults.
