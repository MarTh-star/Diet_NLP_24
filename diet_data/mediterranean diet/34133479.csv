0,methods0," 2.1. Design and Subjects  The study design was cross-sectional, descriptive and comparative. According to the Spanish Statistic National Institute’s [39] (https://www.ine.es/, 4 June 2022) data on populations above 55 years old, it was estimated that a sample size of at least 273 participants would be sufficient under the conditions of α = 0.05 and a two-sided confidence interval = 90%. The sample was initially composed of 356 subjects, all Spanish from different regions, with a single inclusion criterion, namely, being at least 55 years old; 14 of them were discarded for not completing the questionnaires correctly, so the final sample was 342 subjects.  All subjects were recruited for three months, invited to participate voluntarily and provided written informed consent. They were informed of the objectives of this investigation, and data protection was ensured. The surveys were completed anonymously.",c35f14b3-9f5d-4674-8720-74e4c23e6053
1,methods1," The research complies with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and has the approval of the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Granada (Spain), with code 1230/CEIH/2020.  2.2. Outcomes  Sociodemographic data such as age, sex and more common diseases suffered in the last 12 months were collected (hypertension: systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 and diastolic ≥85 mmHg; cholesterol: HDL-c < 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) in men and <50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in women; diabetes: fasting glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL [40]). Anthropometric variables were taken by trained personnel. Height was measured in centimetres using a wall-mounted stadiometer (Seca 214, SECA Deutschland, Hamburg, Germany), and weight was measured in kilograms with a high-precision scale (Tanita BC-418, Tanita, Tokyo, Japan). All participants were weighed barefoot and wearing light clothing, subtracting 0.6 kg from the total for clothing.",0203a124-84cf-4052-a782-100373ecc558
2,methods2," Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters (kg/m2).  Physical activity was measured using the Spanish version of the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity Questionnaire (RAPA-Q) [41], a validated questionnaire that is easy to use, proven reliable and sensitive, and specifically designed for use with older adults [42]. Its seven items can be answered affirmatively (yes) or negatively (no) and allow easy identification of PA level (PA level (PAL)), depending on whether the World Health Organization (WHO) minimum practice recommendations to obtain benefits for cardiovascular health [24] are achieved. Thus, the subjects who practiced more than 150 min per week of moderate activities or 75 min of vigorous activities were classified as active and the rest as non-active.",03998a38-9697-42f4-b143-23ef2ad4bdf9
3,methods3,"  The Physical Self-Concept (Physical self concept (PSC)) was assessed using a Physical self concept (PSC)-Questionnaire (Physical self concept (PSC)-Q) that was an adaptation to the Spanish population [43] of the original Physical Self-Perception Profile (PSPP 30) [28]. It consists of 30 items that are valued on a five-point Liker scale (“Strongly disagree” = 1, “Strongly agree” = 5). It is divided into five dimensions: physical condition (PC, α = 0.84); sports competence (SC, α = 0.88); physical attractiveness (AT, α = 0.88); physical strength (ST, α = 0.83); and general physical self-concept (Physical self concept (PSC), α = 0.88). These dimensions were categorized into quartiles of the score range of each test. Thus, the classes or levels-groups were “Very Low” (PC ≤ 10.50, AT ≤ 14.00, SC ≤ 10.50, ST ≤ 8.75, Physical self concept (PSC) ≤ 8.75); “Low” (PC ≤ 15.00, AT ≤ 20.00, SC ≤ 15.00, ST ≤ 12.50, Physical self concept (PSC) ≤ 12.50) “High” (PC ≤ 19.50, AT ≤ 26.00, SC ≤ 19.",9cfffbe8-ab8a-45f9-b637-4923c1ec9cc2
4,methods4,"5, ST ≤ 16.75, Physical self concept (PSC) ≤ 16.75); and “Very High” (PC ≤ 24.00, AT ≤ 32.00, SC ≤ 24.00, ST ≤ 20.00, Physical self concept (PSC) ≤ 20.00).  To quantitatively estimate adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP), the validated Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) [44] was used. This questionnaire was originally made from a validated FFQ (r = 0.52; p < 0.001) [44] and evaluated the effects of the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) on the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [15,44,45,46]. It consists of 14 items, 12 on the frequency of consumption of main foods (olive oil, wine, fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, nuts, meat and its derivatives, poultry, butter, pastries and carbonated/sweetened beverages), and 2 on the eating habits characteristic of the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP): chicken and olive oil used as cooking fat. Each affirmative answer is valued with one point.",885e90ba-240b-49a7-ae22-884ef3c3bfc0
5,methods5," If the sum of points is equal to or greater than 10, it was considered that there was adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) [14], a fact that allowed the sample to be divided into two groups, those adhering to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) (adhering to the MDP (AMD)) and those who did not (Nadhering to the MDP (AMD)).  2.3. Statistics  Statistical analysis was performed with the R statistical computing software (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). The normality was analysed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test with the Lillieforts correction, and homoscedasticity was assessed with the Levene test. For the basic descriptions, frequencies, means and standard deviations were used. For comparisons between groups of continuous variables, the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test for independent variables was used. For bivariate correlations, Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient was used.",77d2fc0f-6591-4208-82e2-2c6ae8519fda
6,methods6," The association between categorical variables was evaluated using the Chi-square test and its magnitude with Cramer’s V coefficient. An effect size < 0.1 reflects no association, ≥0.1 but ≤0.3 reflects a weak association, >0.3 but ≤0.5 reflects a moderate association and >0.5 reflects a strong association. The internal reliability of the instruments was evaluated using Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient. All reported p-values are based on the two-tailed test, and the level of statistical significance for all tests was established at 95%. Any missing data involved the removal of study participants.  3. Results  Table 1 shows the characteristics of the sample according to their classification by sex, the PA level (PAL) and adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP). Significant differences were observed in all variables when comparing sexes, being higher in all values and proportions in men.",478e63ac-4348-4012-9916-2889268fc021
7,methods7," No significant differences were obtained when comparing the adhering to the MDP (AMD) and the Nadhering to the MDP (AMD) groups in any of the variables. Between the groups of active and non-active subjects, there were significant differences in the variable height (p = 0.032) and, consequently, Body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001). Regarding the practice of PA, the percentage of active subjects was higher than non-active (active = 68.24%, non-active = 31.75%; p < 0.001). Nevertheless, the percentage of subjects in the adhering to the MDP (AMD) group was lower than in the Nadhering to the MDP (AMD) group (adhering to the MDP (AMD) = 39.88%, Nadhering to the MDP (AMD) = 60.11%, p < 0.001).  Table 2 shows the bivariate correlations between the physical self-concept dimension, the adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern, and physical activity. Significant and moderated correlations with the ADM was obtained by Physical self concept (PSC) (r = 0.27) and PC (r = 0.21).",956f2229-2dd9-4e35-aa25-be7d30a66090
8,methods8," Regarding to PA, highlighted PC with a strong correlation (r = 0.46), followed by AT (r = 0.31) and SC (r = 0.31). No significant correlation was found between the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) and PA.  Table 3 shows the distribution of the sample according to the results obtained in the Physical self concept (PSC)-Q classified in the level-groups (very low = VL; low = L; high = H; very high = VH), and differentiating between active/non-active and the ADM/NADM groups. The internal consistency of the Physical self concept (PSC) showed an acceptable level, both globally (α = 0.93) and for the different subdomains (SC, α = 0.86; PC, α = 0.87; AT, α = 0.81; ST, α = 0.72; Physical self concept (PSC), α = 0.72). Significant differences were for all subdomains and groups except for the SC subdomain and Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) groups (p = 0.136).",2b43c1b5-5b24-40f6-bb25-b5349462e190
9,methods9," In all the Physical self concept (PSC)-Q subdomains, an increasing behaviour was observed in the proportion of subjects belonging to the adhering to the MDP (AMD) group from the categories VL to VH (Physical self concept (PSC) = 16.67% vs. 42.06%; PC = 22.73% vs. 43.38%; A = 29.03% vs. 45.79%; SC = 29.41% vs. 43.66%; ST = 30.43% vs. 47.66%), while for the Nadhering to the MDP (AMD) group, this behaviour was inverse. The greatest differences regarding the percentage of subjects adhering to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) were obtained for the Physical self concept (PSC) dimension, where the VL category was composed of 83.33% of the Nadhering to the MDP (AMD) and 57.94% of the adhering to the MDP (AMD) group (p = 0.001). This dimension was also the one that showed the strongest association with adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) (Cramer´s V = 0.221), followed by PC (V = 0.173), ST (V = 0.155) and AT (V = 0.140).",0eedac1f-b218-4387-b0e2-322c156a2929
10,methods10," Regarding the practice of PA, significant differences (p < 0.001) were obtained between the categories of all the subdomains of the Physical self concept (PSC)-Q, also giving the highest percentages of the active population in the VH categories and the lowest in VL (Physical self concept (PSC) = 80.37% vs. 25.00%; PC = 89.71% vs. 29.55%; AT = 82.24% vs. 48.39%; SC = 77.46% vs. 41.18%; ST = 78.91% vs. 21.09%). The strongest associations occurred in the PC (V = 0.497) and the Physical self concept (PSC) (V = 0.414).  Table 4 shows the percentage of individuals who answered “yes” to each item of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire, highlighting items 1, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13 and 14 for their high percentage (>70%), as well as the distribution for each level-group of Physical self concept (PSC).",581c4ca0-4e7e-4539-a2b7-915bd11642d4
11,methods11," In the highest level-group of Physical self concept (PSC) (VH), there was a higher proportion of individuals who stated that they consumed ≥4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) per day (p = 0.001, V = 0.206); ≥2 servings of vegetables per day, (p = 0.001, V = 0.300); ≥1 portion of red or processed meat per day (p = 0.029, V = 0.150); ≥3 portions of legumes per week (p = 0.001, V = 0.255); ≥3 fish servings per week (p = 0.001, V = 0.246); ≤2 sweets per week (p = 0.001, V = 0.212); and ≥3 servings of nuts per week (p = 0.001, V = 0.206). No significant association was found between PA practice and adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) (active/ADM = 42.65% vs. non active/ADM = 33.92%; p = 0.898).  4. Discussion  The current results revealed that the Physical self concept (PSC) and its subdomains are positively associated with PA and Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) adherence in older adults.",8dc218e3-7564-49e0-9ba6-e05ee9e4e1a5
12,methods12," However, we hypothesized that this association with the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) would be weaker than expected.  Regarding the positive association between Physical self concept (PSC) and the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP), the current results are consistent with those reported by similar studies in the Spanish adolescent population [30,32,33,47,48]. It obtained very similar correlation values for Physical self concept (PSC) and the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) [49]; however, it was also affirmed that self-concept in each dimension represents a significant risk of lack of adherence to the Mediterranean diet [30]. Moreover, the highest values of Physical self concept (PSC) were found in the high adherence group [33].  However, the association between the practice of PA and adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) shown in recent studies [6,14,33,48] could not be corroborated.",70a02fd9-cbd0-4b3c-9ee5-f909119be0e3
13,methods13," It could be incongruous since Physical self concept (PSC) is in line with what has already been established in the literature and positively and strongly associated with the practice of PA, especially in the subdomains PC and SC [30,46]. In the current study, all dimensions of Physical self concept (PSC) were positively associated with PA; these results are similar to previous research carried out with children and adolescents [30,31,47].  Nevertheless, in the current sample, there were considerable number of individuals with high or very high levels of Physical self concept (PSC) with high levels of the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) but who were non-active.",79c9643c-1687-4b85-95cf-82e776a45474
14,methods14," One of the explanations could lie in the age factor, since the older adult, despite being less active or practicing activity at very light intensities, tends to perceive himself positively and in good physical health when he maintains the strength, functionality and mobility necessary to perform daily tasks [50,51], or if that person was considered very active during the early stages of life, whether in childhood, adolescence or young adulthood [3].  Something similar occurs concerning physical attractiveness and body image since older adults tend to underestimate states of overweight or obesity, perceiving themselves as in good physical condition [11,37,38,48]. One of the strengths of the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) is its strong cultural roots since it has been transmitted from generation to generation as part of the lifestyle of the Mediterranean area [18], being another reason that could reduce the differences between active and non-active individuals [37].",9db92fdf-8fa5-4cc9-a152-e3d180d3c959
15,methods15," However, changes in most recent lifestyles are causing a progressive abandonment of the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) that is already beginning to be evident even in precursor countries, such as Spain, Italy or Greece, in favour of a less varied diet and more Westernized [21,52]. In the coming years, the differences between active and non-active groups with regard to adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) may be more pronounced, especially among generations after the well-known “baby boomers” [52].  It is striking that among all the items in the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire, there was a high prevalence for this population related to the low consumption of cream and butter, industrial pastries, carbonated beverages, and imported Western habits. These unhealthy habits are very popular today among the young population [52].",36f1f257-9471-43b4-8272-c7b18e6c1ff7
16,methods16," Still, some research found that adolescents who most practice physical activity also eat healthily, reporting a lower consumption of fast food and sweets [53].  Therefore, our results suggest that older adults know how to stay away from these habits. Nevertheless, they are losing others of vital importance for proper nutrition and health, such as the consumption of extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)), vegetables, fruit, legumes, and nuts. This is especially notable in those individuals who showed a very low physical self-concept.  The current study shows that a situation of very low physical self-concept in older adults should be considered a risk factor for health since it was associated with less physical activity, with the consequences already described in the literature [22], and with a lower intake of foods typical of the Mediterranean diet that are of vital importance for the maintenance of a correct nutritional state.",10797224-898d-4f05-9a80-2e77d63aac9b
17,methods17," Specifically, the frequent consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), fish and nuts, foods rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, reduces both the risk of contracting a mental disability or dementia [7] and the risk of suffering cardiovascular events, some of which can seriously limit mobility and cause disability [45,54]. Fruits and vegetables, which are rich in magnesium and micronutrients with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, benefit muscle metabolism, and their absence in the diet of the older adult is related to an increased risk of the loss of musculoskeletal health due to sarcopenia and osteoporosis [14,55,56], and with it, loss of quality of life due to the increased risk of fractures or physical disability [54].",27e3982b-f8e7-4d9b-8e3b-cef890bd6877
18,methods18," Likewise, legumes, rich in vegetable proteins, fibre, antioxidants, phytochemicals and other bioactive components, improve glycaemic control, lower blood lipids, reduce intestinal fat absorption, and help reduce metabolic disorders [12].  Strength and Limitations  The main strength of the current study is that it has been demonstrated that low levels of PA and non-adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) are associated with low levels of Physical self concept (PSC) levels in older adults. The current study has several limitations. The main one is its descriptive cross-sectional design, which does not allow establishing causal relationships between the Physical self concept (PSC), Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) and PA variables, so longitudinal studies will be required in the future. Secondly, the data obtained for the evaluation of both PA and dietary habits were reported by the participants.",6c91c279-170a-429e-83cd-8a60cb9d5fd4
19,methods19," Lacking objective data, it is necessary that the data shown here and its interpretation be taken with caution.  5. Conclusions  Non-adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) and low levels of PA are associated with low levels of Physical self concept (PSC) in older adults. The lack of adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) is mainly reflected in a loss of classic habits of the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) without including habits of globalization and those from other cultures. As a future perspective, it would be necessary to analyse the relationship between Physical self concept (PSC) both with the practice of PA and adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP), including the possible influence of the state of health.",747d74ca-b052-4384-b3d1-1c546d641077
20,methods20," Likewise, the design of educational and institutional health programs aimed at the older adult population should transmit and reinforce the importance for the health of keeping active and maintaining the eating habits typical of the Mediterranean diet so that they contribute to curbing its progressive abandonment.
