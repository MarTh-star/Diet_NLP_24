0,abstract0,"  There is a growing appreciation that the interaction between diet, the gut microbiota and the immune system contribute to the development and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)). A mounting body of scientific evidence suggests that high-fat diets exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, there is a lack of information on how specific types of fat impact colitis. The Mediterranean diet (MD) is considered a health-promoting diet containing approximately 40% total fat. It is not known if the blend of fats found in the MD contributes to its beneficial protective effects.  Mice deficient in the mucin 2 gene (Muc 2−/−) were weaned to 40% fat, isocaloric, isonitrogenous diets.",6a1862d4-3b77-4ab2-a11b-d0f1f1c6bcd9

The MD resulted in lower clinical and histopathological scores and induced tolerogenic CD103+ CD11b+ dendritic, Th22 and IL-17+ IL-22+ cells necessary for intestinal barrier repair. The MD was associated with beneficial microbes and associated with higher cecal acetic acid levels negatively correlated with colitogenic microbes like Akkermansia muciniphila. In contrast, CO showed a higher prevalence of mucin-degraders including A. muciniphila and Enterobacteriaceae, which have been associated with colitis.

5,abstract5,"7 As a result of these defects, microbes are in continuous contact with the intestinal epithelium triggering immune activation.8 Similarly, mice that lack Muc2 (Muc2−/− mice), which subsequently impairs intestinal barrier function, develop spontaneous colitis which is dependent on the presence of gut microbes and environmental conditions (i.e., facility).9,10 Muc2−/− mice display dynamic changes in the gut microbiota including enrichment in potential opportunistic pathogens Akkermansia muciniphila, and decreases in Lactobacillus spp. and Lachnospiraceae.11 The mucosal defense factor resistin-like molecule-β (RELM-β) is upregulated during gut inflammation and RELM-β deficiency attenuates colitis development and symptoms in Muc2−/− mice. The upregulation of RELM-β in the Muc2−/− model is associated with severe rectal prolapse, which is considered a severe form of colitis in this model.",6e49a454-6af2-4106-aac7-04a2c4ba9553
6,abstract6,"12  Much of the research on diet and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has focused on the negative impact of high fat intake and its association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).13,14 However, one diet higher in the recommended fat intake than national guidelines, the Mediterranean diet (MD) (40% by energy derived from fat), has been associated with beneficial effects in immune and metabolic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).15 Additionally, we and others have shown that the type of fat, independent of caloric content, influence intestinal inflammation, metabolism, and host-microbe function.16,17,18 For example, murine models have demonstrated that n-6 PUFA and saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)) result in inflammation-induced colonic damage while monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) are protective.",fe395066-2a5a-44cb-ad2e-8c56b2eaee31

11,results0," MD protects against severe clinical disease activity and histological damage  A MD fat blend was compared to isocaloric corn oil, olive oil or milk fat diets in Muc2−/− mice (Table 1). No differences in food intake or weight changes were seen between any diet groups (Figure S1A and S1B), indicating that variations in colitis were not driven by increased caloric intake or weight gain. Mice fed the MD and OO diets had significantly lower disease activity index (disease activity index (DAI)) scores than the MF diet, with the MD showing the lowest disease activity index (DAI) compared to the other diet groups (Figure 1a, Figure S1C). Ten percent of the CO and MF mice developed rectal prolapse, the most severe form of colitis assessed by our scoring system. No rectal prolapses were seen in the MD or OO diets (Figure 1c).",65965880-0142-4f82-b7e8-36d8d1ed09a0
12,results1," The CO diet had an earlier onset of rectal prolapse (week 6, week 7 and week 9) than the MF diet (week 8 and 2 mice at week 9), suggesting the mice fed CO developed a more aggressive form of colitis earlier. Shortening of the colon, a hallmark sign of increased inflammation and disease severity in colitis,20 was not seen in the MD or MF fed diet, whereas the CO and OO fed diets had significantly shorter colons than mice fed the MD (Figure 1b). In agreement with the clinical observations, histopathological differences were observed between the diet groups the MD group showed the lowest total histopathological scores with the least epithelial damage, in addition to fewer ulcerations and abscesses (Figure 1i). Data from both males and females were combined, as statistically significant sex differences were not detected (Figure S1D).",eed2f4fc-88df-4c31-aee0-ece30e006d11

The MD and MF diets show more cells positive for apoptotic DNA fragmentation than the CO diet. These results suggest the CO diet has a dysregulated balance between proliferation and apoptosis.

Neutrophil infiltration was assessed through immunofluorescent staining of myeloperoxidase positive (MPO+) cells, as an over-exuberant neutrophil response is known to cause epithelial damage in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).23 The MF and OO fed diets had the highest number of MPO+ cells, with the MD showing significantly less infiltration than the MF diet (Figure S2). Unexpectedly, the CO-fed diet had weak staining for MPO+ cell infiltration compared to the other diet groups despite showing more ulcerations and more severe colitis, which suggests other intestinal responses besides neutrophils are driving colonic damage, although we did not rule out netosis.",af967a06-75f5-4cce-9f41-6eed6eb99010
19,results10," Immunostaining for T lymphocytes confirmed a significant influx of CD4 + T lymphocytes into the intestinal mucosa of the CO and MF-fed diets in comparison to the MD (Figure 2c and 2f). CD4 + T cells are enriched in lesional tissue and are key initiators of disease progression in colitis.24 The increased damage seen in the CO diet may result from suppression of important homeostatic immune responses (proliferation and apoptosis) and increased infiltration of CD4 + T lymphocytes. Overall, the fat blend in the MD protects against severe and damaging colitis due to functional homeostatic balance.  MD decreases colonic cytokines that drive colitis  To determine how the MD fat blend protects against the development of severe colitis, we examined the cytokine mRNA gene expression in the distal colon, specifically RELM-ß and IL-6, as they are known drivers of colitis in the Muc2−/− model.",c8df50d1-c277-46a3-b8c1-67ec0c930ad3
20,results11,"12 In accordance with the clinical markers of disease and the histological analysis, we saw a significant decrease in the expression of mRNA inflammatory cytokines RELM-ß and IL-6 in the MD compared to the CO diet (Figure 3a and 3b). Interestingly, despite the increased disease activity index (DAI) and histological damage seen in the MF diet, the MF diet uniquely showed reduced mRNA expression of RELM-ß, yet an increased expression of the mRNA antimicrobial peptide REG3-γ (Figure 3a and 3c). No differences were seen between TNF-α, FOXP3, TGF-β1, Ebi3 or IL-22 colonic mRNA expression amongst the diet groups (Table S3).

There were no significant differences between the diets in the proportion of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils (Table S4); however, the MF diet did show the largest absolute number of these cells, which correlates with the increased ulcers and abscesses seen in the histology.

We next examined the various immune cell subtypes to elucidate further how the type of fat impacts the adaptive inflammatory responses.

25,results17," G-CSF is a crucial regulator of neutrophil differentiation and enhances the bactericidal function of neutrophils, whereas MCP-1 is a necessary component of the inflammatory response required for tissue protection, remodeling, and healthy expansion.30 Mice lacking G-CSF are more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis.31 This would support the weak staining for MPO+ cell infiltration for neutrophils with immunofluorescent staining in the CO diet compared to the other diet groups (Figure S2). Colonic mRNA expression of IL-10 and serum IL-10 was significantly increased in the mice fed the CO diet (Figure 3d and Table 2). IL-10 is considered an essential anti-inflammatory cytokine crucial in the maintenance of immune homeostasis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, there is emerging evidence that IL-10 may play a previously underappreciated dual role, with its function highly dependent on the timing of IL-10 production.",a8696842-522c-4c25-8aaa-c752ddc16bc5
26,results18,"32 Our data show that IL-10 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in the CO diet compared to MD. In this scenario, as we discovered severe intestinal damage and more severe colitis in the CO diet, this could indicate a dysfunctional compensatory effect of IL-10 in this diet group, given the associated damage in the colon. No differences in additional chemokines or cytokines were noted (Table S5). Overall, the MD fat blend was more protective against dysfunctional immune responses than any fat alone. Although the MD did experience inflammation, the inflammation was associated with less damage suggesting these responses were protective in the Muc2−/− mice lacking the mucus layer.",c4aef84b-03c7-441d-9e54-9cf11f6629b8

No differences were seen in the serum levels of glucagon, amylin, peptide YY and C-peptide, ghrelin, resistin or GLP-1 between the diet groups (Table S6). In summary, serum insulin levels between the MD, MF and CO diet are similar yet result in different glucose responses.

In contrast to CO, we see impaired glucose homeostasis in the OO diet due to reduced serum insulin and leptin secretion. Glucose homeostasis is closely regulated by both insulin and leptin, with decreased leptin potentially contributing to reduced insulin sensitivity in the OO diet.33  We sought to determine if the alterations in immune responses and metabolism resulted from changes in barrier function since increased permeability can lead to endotoxemia and precedes colitis.

32,results24," We next examined intestinal alkaline phosphatase (intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP)) activity since intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) activity plays a significant role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and protection with reduced activity associated with worsened mucosal inflammation and metabolic syndrome.34 The MD and MF diets show increased intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) activity than the CO and OO diets (Figure 5i), suggesting that saturated fat plays a key role in intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) function.  Short-chain fatty acids (Short chain fatty acids (SCFA)), including acetic, propionic, and butyric acid, have important immunomodulatory properties and promote gut homeostasis,35 we examined the cecal production of Short chain fatty acids (SCFA). No significant differences were seen in total Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), butyrate, propionate, valeric, iso-valeric or iso-butyric acid (Figure S6).",08229f79-e8cd-4010-aede-cc64d28b37a5
33,results25," However, the MF diet did show reduced production of acetic acid in comparison to the MD (Figure 5j). Although further work is needed to elucidate the influence of acetic acid on intestinal inflammation, preliminary evidence suggests that reduced levels of acetic acid could enhance susceptibility to colitis.36  In summary, the results presented above indicate that type of fat influences glucose homeostasis, serum hormones, IP, Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) activity differentially. Diets that contain saturated fat, such as the MD and MF diets, demonstrate improvements in glucose metabolism, which intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) supports, serum hormones, increased expression of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) and improved intestinal permeability.",9e75547a-ef9e-43b5-a18f-3d0c9daf36e0

Overall, the MD fat blend containing saturated fatty acids (SFA) is an important part of the beneficial effects of the diet metabolism in a colitis susceptible host.  The MD is associated with unique changes in the gut microbiota composition  The emerging evidence on the interconnectedness between the gut microbiome and host metabolism,1 as well as the hypothesized role of the microbiome in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), led us to investigate how the MD fat blend influenced the composition of the gut bacteriome in Muc2−/− mice compared to the individual fat diets.",040b9fb4-238f-4d7b-aa6a-7704c7c0d2f7

41,discussion0," The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is underappreciated, yet evidence-based diet recommendations are needed to determine which dietary patterns inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients can tolerate in their everyday lives. Despite the increasing evidence of the influence of nutritional components and their impact on disease activity, inflammation and the microbiome, significant gaps still exist. This mechanistic study provides compelling evidence that type of fat, not total calories derived from fat, impacts the gut microbiota composition, inflammation, and disease activity in a murine model (Muc2−/−) that develops spontaneous colitis with the MD fat blend protecting against severe colitis.  We demonstrate that the MD, created by blending high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (from OO), saturated fatty acids (SFA) (from MF) combined with some n-3 PUFA (from fish oil) with low n-6 PUFA (from CO), creates a protective fat combination against colitis.",1301e095-cd82-4c1a-a269-598eed0f7fa8

In contrast, mice fed a diet composed of CO or MF develop severe colitis with increased mucosal damage. Although the MD is rich in OO, OO alone resulted in the Muc2−/− mice developing colonic damage, albeit less severe than that seen in the CO or MF diets which both resulted in severe colitis. This data exemplifies that the MD fat blend, not a single type of fat, is important in its ability to protect against colitis completely.

43,discussion2," Unique to the MD, we see a significant increase in the proportion of Th22 cells and tolerogenic CD103+ CD11b+ dendritic cells and immune regulating signals like serum G-CSF, which are critical in mediating tolerance to antigens, limiting reactivity to the gut microbiota and are required for restitution.24,27,31 The MF diet showed compensatory protective responses, such as the increased activity of the key mucosal defense factor intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) and antimicrobial lectin RegIII-γ that promotes restitution important in preventing the cycle of chronic inflammation.12,38 These data suggest that the inflammatory response, as seen in the MD, is counterbalanced by an immunosuppressive response, limiting colonic damage. When MF is provided within a blend of fats, as seen in the MD, the protective inflammatory responses of the MF diet are conferred, limiting mucosal damage and ultimately colitis severity.",29bfdd91-011c-4a3a-b272-c4a2b1bdbcda
44,discussion3,"  We observe an increased mRNA expression of RELM-β with an increased rectal prolapse rate in the CO diet. In contrast, the MF diet had lower RELM-β expression compared to the CO yet displayed a colitic phenotype; however, these diets resulted in very different metabolic phenotypic profiles. Thus, the hypothesis that RELM-β drives susceptibility to colonic inflammation in the Muc2−/− model may depend on additional factors, including diet.39 Mice fed a high-fat diet (lard as a saturated fat source) exhibit higher levels of RELM-β protein in the stool and have altered glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia due to impaired insulin signaling.39,40 Notably, our results from the MF diet, a different type of saturated fatty acid, contradict these findings, which could suggest that different types of saturated fatty acids may influence RELM-β expression.",ba4d14fe-6488-47f5-a750-30d4e074cac7

Further research is needed to determine how various types of fat may influence RELM-β and RegIII-γ expression.  Dietary fat composition has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance, including type 2 diabetes, with each type of fat having vastly different effects on insulin resistance and metabolic control.41 Metabolic abnormalities are increasingly being identified in both human and animal models of colitis.1 We demonstrate in Muc2−/− mice that OO and CO diets promote impairments in glucose tolerance, barrier function and alterations to hormone levels leading to metabolic alterations.

46,discussion5," In line with the unique immunological effects of each type of fat, these results show that MF provided as a component of a fat blend (MD) plays a key role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and gut barrier function. The potential mechanisms could be through increased activity of the key mucosal defense factor intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP),34 reduced expression of RELM-β and increases in key hormones like PP known to enhance insulin sensitivity.42  Alterations in the microbiota are linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), metabolic diseases, as well as other inflammatory conditions.1 Multiple research groups have established the effect of a high-fat diet (i.e., the total calories derived from fat) on the microbiome,43 however knowledge on the influence of specific types of fat on gut microbial ecology is lacking.

In addition, we show that each type of fat differentially impacts the development of colitis and that it is not necessarily the total fat content of the diet that aggravates colitis. Although the observed effects of a MD need to be confirmed through interventional studies in individuals living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it would be prudent to have patients focus on the types of lipids and their subsequent food sources versus the restriction of total fat in the diet. The MD is a healthful diet that has the potential to maintain an appropriate immune response while mitigating the damaging effects of chronic inflammation, and future research is needed to confirm these results in humans.",7daf0239-3b80-4c0c-a28b-80e3277b3065

Briefly, each 10 ul of each sample was treated with 100 ul of ALP Assay Buffer and 20 ul of 0.5 mM Methylumbelliferyl phosphate disodium salt (Methylumbelliferyl phosphate disodium salt (MUP)) and incubated at 25°C for 30 minutes. Next, 20 ul of an inhibitor (aqueous K2HPO4) was added to each well.",c66bee80-f18c-45c2-98e3-4719d25afced
64,discussion23," In addition, a standard curve was created using a stock solution of 1 mg/mL BSA (Sigma) in triplicates with multiple concentrations. Fluorescence intensity was measured using the Promega GloMax Multi Detection System (Promega) at 360 nm excitation and 440 nm emission. Total relative protein concentration was quantified using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Ontario, Canada). intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) values are expressed as units of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP)/mg of protein.  Glucose tolerance test (intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT))  At nine weeks, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing (intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT)) was completed, using standard protocols from the D.I.A.B.E.T.E.S. Center (UBC-Okanagan, Kelowna, BC, Canada). Briefly, a dose of 1 g/kg body weight glucose (20% wt/vol glucose solution) was administered via intraperitoneal injection.",e3a7c5b1-f867-4b16-a71b-b23737e55491
65,discussion24," Blood sampling and glucose testing was performed at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120-minutes following glucose injection.  Microbiome processing  Microbiome analysis was completed on the distal colon samples. The DNA was extracted using the QIAamp PowerFecal Pro DNA kit (Qiagen; Cat No 51804) with an additional wash step to increase DNA purity. Extracted DNA was normalized using a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer, and the V4-V5 region of the 16S ribosomal DNA was amplified using 515 FB and 926 R primers attached to the Illumina adapter overhang. Samples were sequenced by the Integrated Microbiome Resource (Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada) according to their protocol.60  Bioinformatic analysis  Post-sequencing analyses were performed using the QIIME 2 platform (version 2021.4).61 Demultiplexed reads from two MiSeq runs were imported into the QIIME 2 environment, and primers were removed using the q2-cutadapt plugin.",52aea68f-a6d2-43eb-be29-ff1e4d816300
66,discussion25,"62 Quality control entailed filtering, dereplication, chimera removal, denoising, and merging of paired-end reads on each run separately using the DADA2 plugin with default settings.63 The resulting amplicon sequence variant (amplicon sequence variant (ASV)) tables were merged for downstream analysis. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using a SATé-enabled phylogenetic placement (SATé enabled phylogenetic placement (SEPP)) technique as implemented in the q2-fragment-insertion plugin64 using a backbone tree built from the Greengenes reference database (version 13.8).65 For taxonomic classification, we trained a classifier on the entire length 16S region and incorporated environment-specific abundances weights specific to animal distal gut environment acquired from the readytowear repository (https://github.com/BenKaehler/readytowear).",b3e100f7-a193-491b-8eb5-94b9ef4cfbbf
67,discussion26," This weighted bespoke approach for taxonomic classification has been shown to significantly improve accuracy over common Naive Bayes classification methods.66 Before diversity analysis, all amplicon sequence variant (ASV)s that were not classified at least at the phylum level were discarded as contaminants, and only samples with at least 1,000 sequences were kept. A final table consisting of 7 CO, 8 MD, 9 MF, and 14 OO samples were retained for downstream analysis. Alpha-diversity metrics (Shannon’s diversity index, Faith’s phylogenetic diversity, amplicon sequence variant (ASV) richness and Pielou’s Evenness) were used.61 For beta diversity, we used the q2-DEICODE plug-in60 which calculates a form of Aitchison distances that is robust to high levels of sparsity, is compositionally aware, and circumvents the need for rarefying.",5a15b6fe-a26b-4374-930e-3c7f3ca71b05
68,discussion27," Using the q2-beta group significance plugin, a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)) test (α = 0.05, with 999 permutations) was run on the robust Aitchison distances to determine differences between diet groups. The permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) test’s assumption of multivariate dispersion was assessed using a PERMDISP test. We utilized multinomial regression using Songbird67 to obtain amplicon sequence variant (ASV) rankings most associated with each group. These differential ranks were visualized using Qurro 68 and the differentials for the top 10 amplicon sequence variant (ASV)s associated with each group were exported into R69 using the qiime2R package [https://github.com/jbisanz/qiime2R] for further custom visualization and statistical analysis.
