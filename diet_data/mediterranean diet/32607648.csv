0,methods0," 2.1. Study Setting  The present study was conducted at two locations in Central California. Livermore, with a population of 90,189 [17] located in Alameda County, is the easternmost city in the San Francisco Bay Area and is considered a gateway community to the Central Valley. Livermore is a science and technology center that contains the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories and has a median household income of USD 116,942 [32]. In Livermore, 77.2% of the population is white, 1.8% African American, 11.1% Asian, and 20.2% Hispanic or Latino, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native [17]; 51.1% of the population is female [17]; 12.9% of the population is 65 years old and over, while 23.5% are under the age of 18; and 41.8% of the population holds a bachelor’s degree or higher [17]. According to the United States Census American Community Survey, the top three reported ancestries reported in Livermore city are German, Irish, and English [33].",ba456e18-8900-421c-9d05-7dad8eee2df7
1,methods1,"  With a population of 73,631, Turlock is the second largest town in Stanislaus County, located in the rural San Joaquin Valley region of the Central Valley [32]. Turlock has a median household income of USD 56,639 [32]. Turlock contains one public university, California State University Stanislaus [18]. In Turlock, 76.8% of the population is white, 2.4% African American, 5.6% Asian, 37.1% Hispanic or Latino, 0.7% American Indian and Alaska Native [18]; 51.9% of the population is female; 13.0% of the population is 65 years old and over, while 26.8% are under the age of 18; and 24.5% of the population holds a bachelor’s degree or higher and 81.1% hold a high school education or higher [18]. According to the United States Census American Community Survey, the top three reported ancestries reported in Turlock city are German, Portuguese, and English [33].  2.2.",a9f75fe9-d7a3-4f78-8495-b37e4d1bc4d6
2,methods2," Survey Instrument  A previously validated survey instrument was used to assess MedDiet adherence, participants’ stage of change, barriers, and benefits towards adopting the MedDiet and demographic variables [29]. Participants’ MedDiet adherence was assessed using a validated [34] 14-question Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) that has been used to evaluate MedDiet adherence in Europe, including Portugal, and throughout the world [27,35,36,37]. Additionally, three questions were asked to assess participants’ readiness to adopt a MedDiet using the Precaution Adoption Process Model (stages of change). Perceived barriers (18 questions; knowledge, convenience, sensory appeal, and health) and benefits (26 questions; knowledge, weight loss, ethical concerns, natural content, familiarity, price, sensory appeal, and mood) to the MedDiet were measured using a five-point Likert scale.",b66021e8-f816-43c9-ba80-3e782ee7be13
3,methods3," Seven demographic and anthropometric questions determining the age, sex, ethnicity, height, weight, level of education, and previous nutrition education or knowledge were assessed. Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms (kg) by height in meter (m) squared. All survey questions were self-reported. The survey instrument was translated from English to Portuguese by a Portuguese language teacher and was back-translated from Portuguese to English by three native Portuguese speakers.  2.3. Survey Distribution  This study was approved by the Auburn University Institutional Review Board prior to distributing the surveys, which included language for inferred consent. Convenience sampling was used to obtain completed surveys from shoppers of Save Mart Supermarket stores in both Livermore and Turlock, California, from 14 October 2019 to 1 January 2020.",50698f4b-5377-4495-b7e1-e7333f7d4532
4,methods4," Both Livermore and Turlock Save Mart Supermarket stores were open seven days a week, but only allowed sampling and data collection on Mondays and Saturdays. All Save Mart Supermarket Corporation rules and regulations for outside vendors were followed. Participants were not compensated for completing the survey instrument. All adults at least 45 years old in Livermore and Turlock were eligible for the study. Participants were provided the option of completing the survey in Portuguese. Approximately 37% of the participants residing in Turlock completed the survey in Portuguese. Two hundred and eleven participants completed surveys. Three surveys were excluded because participants did not answer all questions or did not meet the age requirement to participate in the study. The remaining 208 responses were a priori divided into two groups based on the geographical location of survey collection in California: Turlock (n = 125) and Livermore (n = 83).  2.4.",fcafb34b-49b8-4376-b81f-566f80ce2318
5,methods5," Statistical Analyses  All data analyses were conducted with RStudio and the Rx64 3.6.0 software environment (RStudio, PBC, Boston, MA, USA). A crude (unadjusted) and multivariable backward stepwise linear regression analysis was used to assess the differences in total MedDiet adherence scores between the groups. Regression coefficient p values and main effect p values calculated using a type III Sum of Squares test were reported. A multivariate linear model was used to determine barriers and benefit question scores in the groups: the crude model was unadjusted and the adjusted model included all demographic variables. A backward stepwise elimination logistic regression was performed to identify the predictors of the stage of change with the demographic variables. Inclusion and retention criteria in the logistic regression model were set at p-value cutoff points of 0.25 and 0.10, respectively. A significance level of 0.05 was established.  3. Results  3.1.",bff3bf30-47f3-4d73-b049-e9e9af30eceb
6,methods6," Demographic Assessment  We examined whether there were demographic differences between participants in the Turlock and Livermore groups. As shown in Table 1, significant differences (p < 0.05) in age, ethnicity, and education were observed between the participants in Turlock compared to Livermore. The Turlock group had a lower percentage of older adults (>65 years old), a greater percentage of participants in the ‘other ethnic group’ category, and a lower percentage of participants with associate’s, bachelor’s, and master’s/profession degrees. There were no statistical differences between groups for sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), and health-related qualifications.  3.2. Mediterranean Diet Adherence  The total (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) score was analyzed using a crude and multivariable backward stepwise linear regression model adjusting for the demographic variables of sex and age.",36528a81-fa7e-478e-8647-50ad3e7c4aef
7,methods7," We observed an increase in the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores in the Turlock group in comparison to the Livermore group in both the crude and adjusted models (Table 2). For each point increase in the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score in the Livermore group, an increase of 0.85 +/− 0.26 points (p = 0.001) was observed in the Turlock group in the crude model and 0.81 +/− 0.30 points (p = 0.002) in the adjusted model. When evaluating both demographic variables and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score, the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score was 0.55 +/− 0.25 points lower in males than females and 5.48 +/− 1.79 points higher in respondents older than 75. The demographic variables of education, Body Mass Index (BMI), or nutrition qualifications were not significant and did not improve the parsimoniousness of the lineal model.  3.3.",2c6b86ce-dc55-484f-84cc-ce192b4294e9
8,methods8," Barriers to Consuming a MedDiet in Turlock  Cronbach’s alpha was calculated to assess the internal consistency of 18 questions sorted into four factors: knowledge, convenience, sensory appeal, and health. As shown in Table 3, The Knowledge barrier had a Cronbach’s alpha = 0.43, which is below the 0.60 to 0.70 that is considered acceptable or adequate for assessing the internal consistency [38]. We did not remove questions to improve the reliability of the Knowledge barrier. The Convenience (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.76), Sensory Appeal (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.75), and Health barriers (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.87) were internally valid. We used both an unadjusted (crude) and an adjusted linear regression model for sex, age, ethnicity, education, and Body Mass Index (BMI) to assess knowledge, convenience, sensory appeal, and health barriers in the Turlock group compared to the Livermore group. Convenience (β = 1.12, SE = 0.50, p = 0.027), Sensory Appeal (β = 0.69, SE = 0.33, p = 0.",d108b69b-18d6-4f77-b363-f996e09c371b
9,methods9,"041), and Health (β = 0.39, SE = 0.13, p = 0.003) were observed to be significant barriers to the MedDiet in the Turlock group (Table 3).  3.4. Benefits to Consuming a MedDiet in Turlock  Health, Weight Loss, Ethical Concerns, Natural Content, Familiarity, Price, Sensory Appeal, and Mood factors were used to assess the perceived benefits of adopting a MedDiet among survey participants. All eight barrier factors were internally valid (Health = 0.93; Weight Loss = 0.63; Ethical Concerns = 0.89; Natural Content 0.61; Familiarity = 0.80; Price = 0.91; Sensory Appeal = 0.79; Mood = 0.93). Similar to the assessment of barriers, we used both unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models for sex, age, ethnicity, education, and Body Mass Index (BMI) to assess the benefits from adopting a MedDiet in the Turlock group using the Livermore group as a reference (Table 4). The Turlock group perceived the MedDiet to have more health benefits in the adjusted model (Health: β = 3.72, SE = 0.",8b364429-7363-4372-98da-44bdca4ea9d8
10,methods10,"98, p = <0.001), and this association remained consistent in the crude model. Additionally, Familiarity (Familiarity: β = 0.99, SE 0.26, p = <0.001) was perceived to be a benefit in the Turlock group in both regression models. All benefit factors, except ethical concerns in the adjusted models, were significant (p < 0.05) across the three models in the Turlock group compared to the Livermore group.  3.5. Stages of Change and Demographic Influences  The distribution of participants across stages of change between the Turlock and Livermore groups was significantly different (p < 0.001) (Table 5). More participants in the Action/Maintenance category were observed in the Turlock group. In contrast, the Livermore group had more participants in the Unaware/Unengaged, Deciding, and Decided No category than the Turlock group (p < 0.001) (Table 5).",882e55ff-270c-4cca-8b67-81886eb7057a
11,methods11,"  We performed logistic regression to examine the effect of demographic variables on the likelihood of being in each stage of change towards adopting the MedDiet in the whole cohort (Table 6). Participants were significantly less likely to be in the Unengaged/Unaware stage if they were from the Turlock cohort (OR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.11–0.45, p = <0.001). Additionally, participants who had a master’s or professional degree were shown to be less likely to be in the Unaware/Unengaged stage of change (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05–0.63, p < 0.01). Participants categorized as Black (OR = 9.27, 95% CI: 1.50–180, p = <0.05) were significantly more likely to be in the Unaware/Unengaged stage. In regard to the Deciding and Deciding Yes groups, no significant associations were observed. In contrast, participants with a GED education were more likely to be in the Deciding No stage of change (OR = 9.36, 95% CI: 1.13–65.3, p <0.05).",6e714470-cf9c-4cde-b095-2fd605c6a60b
12,methods12," Lastly, the Turlock cohort was significantly more likely to be in the Action/Maintenance group (OR = 17.7, 95% CI: 6.46–64.6). However, participants who are classified as having a master’s or professional degree (OR = 5.59, 95% CI: 1.71–21.0) were more likely to be in the Action/Maintenance group.  4. Discussion  MedDiet adherence and related factors affecting adherence have not previously been studied among Portuguese immigrants in the United States. Therefore, we used a recently developed survey instrument to assess participants’ MedDiet adherence, the participants’ stage of change towards incorporating the MedDiet in their lifestyle, and perceived benefits and barriers to consuming a MedDiet [29]. To ensure the inclusion of Portuguese adult immigrants in the Turlock group, we surveyed adults older than 45 years old at the local Save Mart store in Turlock and provided the participants the opportunity to complete the survey in Portuguese.",9e8f46fb-7928-4141-9f3d-fa34381d33c8
13,methods13," Indeed, 37% of the Turlock participants preferred to take the survey in Portuguese, while none of the participants identified as Portuguese in Livermore. The population in the present study had a greater percentage of female respondents than reported in the Livermore and Turlock communities [17]. In contrast, the Livermore population in the present study had comparable ethnicity and education demographics compared to those in the Livermore community [17]. In the Turlock population in the present study, comparable ethnicity but not education (less participants in the study with holding a bachelor’s degree) to that in the Turlock community [17] was observed.  We found that the Turlock group had higher adherence to the MedDiet as assessed by the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score compared to the Livermore group. Similarly, a higher percentage of participants in the Turlock group were in the Action/Maintenance stage of change compared to the Livermore group.",948d338b-2f4c-4b2e-b955-0b2dd70fb5c1
14,methods14," This result was surprising given that the majority of respondents in the Turlock group had a high school education or lower and that educational level has been shown to be negatively associated with MedDiet adherence in studies performed in the United States [29] and countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea [39,40]. In contrast, our results are consistent with a study in Portugal where Portuguese households from lower social classes had greater adherence to the Mediterranean food pattern compared to participants at higher social levels [14]. Our findings of higher MedDiet adherence scores in Turlock could be due to the “Healthy Immigrant Effect” where immigrants are, on average, healthier than native-born participants in a given population [41]. Whether diet knowledge, diet decision making, or the ability of immigrant families to overcome diet barriers are factors [42] contributing to greater adherence to the MedDiet in the Turlock group requires formal examination.",e48f715f-abdd-4407-b55a-8cd8a41d4021
15,methods15," Even though Turlock participants were significantly more likely to be in the Action/Maintenance stage of change, we did observe that approximately one-third of participants in Turlock were in the Unaware/Unengaged stage of change. Whether exposure to dietary acculturation, lack of interaction with family or support groups, length of years spent in the United States, immigration status (first vs. second-generation immigrant), or other social/environmental factors that influence acculturation [42,43] explain our findings with Turlock participants in the Unaware/Unengaged stage of change requires further investigation.  The perceived benefit of Familiarity and perceived barriers of Convenience and Sensory Appeal scores in the Turlock group were significantly higher than those in the Livermore group.",b6b485bc-5ad8-44bb-946f-36b3842f41a2
16,methods16," The difference in Familiarity may be due to the Turlock participants’ knowledge of the Portuguese cultural cuisine (high fish, fruit, and cheese consumption, moderate wine consumption, and low processed food consumption [44]) which are aligned with most of the dietary components of the MedDiet [45,46], while the differences in Convenience and Sensory Appeal scores in the Turlock group may be due to an inability to obtain culturally familiar and fresh food in an impoverished rural region of California. Our findings are consistent with a prior study in Israel examining Ethiopian immigrants’ perceived benefits of diet and sensory responses while attempting to maintain current dietary patterns, which found that immigrants’ choices are both guided through convenience and familiarity [47].",e43c9b1a-c43c-45ca-bf51-0dbe2b589043
17,methods17, Sensory appeal and convenience have also been found to be significant factors related to the unwillingness of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in a Northern European community to adjust their diet patterns to a Mediterranean diet [48].  A surprising result in perceived benefits was that weight loss was seen as more of a benefit in the Turlock group rather than the Livermore group. This result is not consistent with prior findings that weight loss as a perceived benefit was observed in participants with low MedDiet adherence [29]. Whether our current findings on perceived weight loss are specific for immigrants from countries where the Mediterranean diet is a settled cultural heritage will require future studies.,c68c2032-9872-4be9-94e8-8c714b1e8db6
18,methods18," Our findings that participants with a Master’s or Professional Degree were over five times more likely to be in the Action/Maintenance stage and had a lower OR of being in the Unaware/Unengaged stage and that participants were nine times more likely to be in the Decided No category if the participant had a GED are consistent with previous studies showing a strong correlation between education level and MedDiet adherence [27,29,49,50,51].  While we took a systematic approach using validated questionnaires to conduct this study, several limitations are acknowledged. We recruited a convenience sample from one Portuguese immigrant population and one reference city; thus, in addition to our relatively small sample size, additional studies with larger Portuguese immigrant populations in other geographic locations are needed to confirm our findings. Similarly, our sample was restricted to adults aged 50 years and older; therefore, the results cannot be applied to the general adult population.",4c331b28-2b7b-4738-9aec-fcf8d71fe56a
19,methods19," Another possible limitation is that the self-reported data in our study, which include weight, height, and dietary assessment, may not reflect actual values. Lastly, we did not formally test the association between immigrant status and high MedDiet adherence in immigrant groups in the United States.  5. Conclusions  The present study identifies a significant increase in MedDiet scores between participants in Turlock and participants in Livermore, which was consistent with a greater proportion of Turlock participants in the Action/Maintenance stage of change. Although high educational levels are strongly associated with higher adherence to the MedDiet, the Turlock group had lower education attainment than the Livermore group, yet had greater MedDiet adherence. Importantly, the benefits of health, weight loss, natural content, familiarity, price, sensory appeal, and mood are key factors in the perception of the MedDiet in the Turlock group.",1746683e-e123-47f0-886e-204744880603
