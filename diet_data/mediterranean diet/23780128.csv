At baseline, all participants were evaluated in terms of their health status.",f8aba4c8-999e-42f6-a0e0-1ae624eb5cd3
1,methods1," The clinical evaluation focused on nutritional status, blood pressure, clinical-biochemical analysis, quantification of ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL), and a genomic evaluation with analysis of five genes belonging to the pathway of oxidative stress and inflammation.  The experimental study was conducted according to a randomized crossover trial with six arms (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6), as shown in the diagram presented in Figure 1.  During the study period volunteers consumed in a randomized order (a) baseline (B); (b) fasting + 250 mL red wine (fasting + 250 mL red wine (FRW)); (c) Mediterranean Meal (MM) [13] (carbohydrates 55–60% of total Kcal; protein 15–20% of total Kcal of which 50% are of vegetable derivation; total fats <30% of total Kcal; saturated fat <10% of total Kcal; polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) 6–10% of total Kcal: 5-6% of total Kcal from n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA),",779a240a-1461-40d8-98b5-0e68ceedbca8

Subjects were asked to maintain their usual lifestyle habits and to report any illness or abnormality presented during the study period. At the end of each arm, a clinician assessed any adverse effects from the interventions by going through a checklist of symptoms including bloating, fullness, or indigestion, altered bowel habit, dizziness, and other symptoms that were possibly associated with the interventions. All patients completed the study.  Nutritional status assessment and genomic analysis were performed at the Clinical Nutrition and Nutrigenomic Section, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention of University of Rome Tor Vergata.  2.2. Anthropometric Measurements After a 12 h overnight fast, all subjects underwent anthropometric evaluation.",2109bd48-02d1-471f-bc1f-2f2097f31410
4,methods4," Anthropometric parameters of all the participants were measured according to standard methods (body weight, height, and waist and hip circumferences) [28]. Subjects were instructed to take off their clothes and shoes before performing all the measurements. Body weight (Kg) was measured to the nearest 0.1 Kg, using a balance scale (Invernizzi, Rome, Italy). Height (cm) was measured using a stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm (Invernizzi, Rome, Italy). The waist (WC) and hip (HC) circumferences were measured with a flexible steel metric tape to the nearest 0.5 cm. WC was measured on the horizontal plane that corresponds with the narrowest point between the iliac crest and the bottom rib. HC was measured at the largest point when observed on a horizontal plane. body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the formula body mass index (BMI) = body weight (Kg)/height (m)2.",d43eafb0-5ea6-4594-a2cd-fed824eaf604

They wore a standard cotton t-shirt, shorts, and socks.",ef6a30ca-9c58-4ade-98ac-157d1e1ea6f6
7,methods7," They lay supine on the Dual Energy X Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scanner without moving for the duration of the scan. The average measurement time was 20 min. Radiation exposure was equivalent to 0.01 mSv. The intra- and intersubject coefficient of variation (CV% = 100 × s.d./mean) ranged from 1 to 5%. The coefficient of variation for bone mass measurements was ≤1%; the coefficients on this instrument for five subjects scanned six times over a 9-month period were 2.2% for TBFat and 1.1% for TBLean.  2.5. Sample Collection and RNA Extraction A fasting blood sample was collected and stabilized in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. The total RNA of each collected sample was purified using the PAXgene Blood miRNA Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (PreAnalytix Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland).",7f77cdb2-2dd9-47c5-a795-0c7384902153
8,methods8," Aliquots of total RNA were then quantified and assessed for quality by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, Wilmington, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis.  2.6. Quantitative Real Time PCR and Data Analysis We used specific RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays (Qiagen, Netherlands); for our study we focused on the Human Oxidative Stress (PAHS-065ZA) pathway, in particular silent information regulator (SIR)T2 CCL5superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and GPx. Each qRT-PCR experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Netherlands). The comparative threshold (CT) cycle was used to determine the gene expression level relative to the calibrator RNA from the controls. Steady state mRNA levels were expressed relative to the calibrator as “n-fold” differences. The CT value for each gene was normalized using the formula ΔCT = CT (gene)-CT (housekeeping gene).",ca7baf1b-f3e9-46d9-b3c1-3e6bd97054fb
9,methods9,"  In particular we used the average of 4 housekeeping genes included in the plates actin beta ACTB (NM_001101), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, HPRT1(NM_000194), beta-2-microglobulin, BM2 (NM_00404080), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH (NM_002046). The relative gene expression levels were determined according to the following formula: ΔΔCT = ΔCT sample −ΔCT calibrator.  The value used to plot relative gene expression was determined using the expression fold change (FC) = 2−ΔΔCT. Raw data were filtered for genes that were significantly changed above factor 1.0 within the 95% confidence interval (P ≤ 0.05) for each experiment. Finally, only genes with an absolute FC value of at least ±1.5 and P value ≤ 0.05 (indicating a statistical significance) were considered as differentially expressed genes.  2.7.

10,methods10," Analysis of the level of oxidation of the organism was observed by the quantification of protein and oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) from the nutrigenomic study. An ELISA test was utilized for the study of low density lipoprotein (LDL) using the Mercodia oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) ELISA (Mercodia Diagnostic, Sweden) according to the customer protocol.  2.7.1. Red Wine Description Masieri red wine (by Biancara of Angiolino & Alessandro Maule, Gambellara, Italy, 2012) was used in the study. This wine is made from a selection of mixed grapes including Merlot (75%), Tocai Rosso (10%), and Cabernet Sauvignon (15%) grown in volcanic soils using natural methods and is produced using the spontaneous fermentation method. The wine's characteristics are as follows: unfiltered wine, without added sulphites; total alcohol: 14.52% volume; relative density: 0.9 g/L; residual sugar: 0.7 g/L; total acidity: 5.9 g/L; dry extract: 30 g/L; volatile acidity: 0.",11e9e379-5e95-4fec-822d-5d6df48edf85

Statistical Analysis A paired t-test or a nonparametric Wilcoxon test was performed to evaluate differences before and after nutritional intervention. All tests were considered significant at P ≤ 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using a computer software package SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  3. Results 3.1. Clinical Trial Of the 30 initial participants initially enrolled, 24 subjects were eligible for the study. Three subjects declined to participate during the first phase, and another three did not meet the inclusion criteria: one of them measured a body mass index (BMI) < 19 Kg/m2, one had diabetes mellitus, and one had a previous history of ischemic heart disease.   Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of all 24 individuals. No subjects were obese on the basis of body mass index (BMI) classification; however 25% of the subjects were overweight.",fcd32068-e70d-4bcc-926a-04c74a15d42e
12,methods12," On the contrary, 25% of subjects had a PBF% > 35 and were therefore classified as obese. None of the subjects were osteoporotic, and, according to ASMMI, 4% of subjects were sarcopenic. No subjects were hypertensive.  The comparison of ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) level in the intervention treatments was shown in Figure 2. A significant increase (P ≤ 0,05) of ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) in the B compared to McD (Δ% = 17.5%) was highlighted.  Ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels significantly decreased (P ≤ 0.05) under the following conditions: (i) McDM versus MM (Δ% = 18.2%); (ii) fasting + 250 mL red wine (FRW) versus MM + 250 mL red wine (MMRW) (Δ% = 11.3%); (iii) McD versus McDRW (%Δ = 20.78%). No significant differences (P > 0.05) in the level of ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) were observed under the following conditions: (i) B versus fasting + 250 mL red wine (FRW) (Δ% = 1.59%); (ii) B versus MM (Δ% = 3.87%); (iii) MM versus MM + 250 mL red wine (MMRW) (Δ% = 6.",d0e1e222-a557-46dc-b248-16421e36183c

Moreover, we analyzed the variation of gene expression of five genes related to oxidative stress and inflammation depending on consumption of different meals with and without red wine (Figure 3).  catalase (CAT) expression decreased significantly (P ≤ 0.05) after McD. On the contrary, a significant increase (P ≤ 0.05) of catalase (CAT) expression was observed between B versus fasting + 250 mL red wine (FRW) and between McD versus McDRW.  GPX1 expression increased significantly (P ≤ 0.05) in the comparison between (i) B versus fasting + 250 mL red wine (FRW); (ii) B versus McDRW; and (iii) B versus MM + 250 mL red wine (MMRW).  silent information regulator (SIR)T2 expression increased significantly (P ≤ 0.",895907d5-9b27-4175-a390-9a1f468691fa

CCL5 expression significantly increased (P ≤ 0.05) in the comparison between (i) B versus McD; (ii) B versus MM; (iii) B versusboth meals with wine (MM + 250 mL red wine (MMRW) and McDRW); and (iv) fasting + 250 mL red wine (FRW) versus McDRW. Meanwhile, CCL5 expression significantly decreased (P ≤ 0.05) between MM versus MM + 250 mL red wine (MMRW).  The value of the Pearson coefficient of R = 0.89 shows a positive correlation (P < 0.001) between silent information regulator (SIR)T2 and catalase (CAT) expression in McD and MM + 250 mL red wine (MMRW). The value of the Pearson coefficient of R = −0.91 shows a negative correlation (P < 0.001) between expression of silent information regulator (SIR)T2 and CCL5 in MM and McD.  4.",d1eb4f41-d7a5-485f-ac53-3acbd68fa207
15,methods15," Discussion Interactions between genetic and environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle, particularly in the case of overnutrition and sedentary behavior, promote the progression and pathogenesis of polygenic diet-related diseases, the prevalence of which is increasing to epidemic proportions.  The effects of dietary compounds on metabolic pathways related to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and other CNCD are currently under investigation and are leading the traditional methods of nutritional counseling towards a more complex approach based on the modulation of gene expression by food.  The evidence connecting nutritional factors to the etiology of cardiovascular disorders is compelling [31]. cardiovascular disease (CVD)s have multiple causes, but the majority of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events originate from the complications of atherosclerosis, a pathophysiological process that can be prevented by nutritional interventions [32].",6dc3a89a-461c-457c-9c97-07ed7e785dc1
16,methods16," For a long time, based on the results of experimental studies carried out in vitro, the preventive effect of phenolics on age-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), was attributed to their antioxidant capacity [33]. The existing data indicate that the role of fruits and their associated nutrients in cardiovascular prevention may be more influential than that of vegetables alone; however, due to the disappointing results of a number of large interventional studies performed with these micronutrients, showing no reduction in overall mortality and even an increased cardiovascular risk, scientists were led to consider other potentially beneficial compounds present in fruits and vegetables [12, 34, 35]. Many studies have emphasized their ability to protect various cellular constituents against oxidation [36].",6d6c560b-7747-488f-b8e9-9c1e4d88e085
17,methods17,"  Among many genetic and environmental causes, the accumulation of modified low density lipoprotein (LDL) [37], such as ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL), and recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages at the atrial subendothelial space [38] are the key factors leading to the development of an atherosclerotic lesion [39]. Indeed, small low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles are easily oxidized to yield the atherogenic ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles that can accumulate in the foam cells of the atherosclerotic plaque [40].  Antioxidant flavonoids and polyphenols became the first substances present in red wine shown to have proven beneficial effects in various diseases, such as inhibition of low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation or attenuation of ischemia-reperfusion injury [41, 42]. Red wine exhibits higher antioxidant capacity and protective effect against low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation when compared to white wine [43–45].",58e5a356-f8a6-4a4b-82b6-323e24897bb4
18,methods18,"  We observed a significant reduction of ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) depending on of the quality of meal consumed. In particular the values for ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) were significantly decreased (P ≤ 0.05) after the MM alone; MM + 250 mL red wine (MMRW) increases the protective effect (P ≤ 0.05). On the other hand, the consumption of McD increases the values of ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) (P ≤ 0.05), while McDRW brings the values for ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) back towards baseline levels (P > 0.05).  Our findings correspond with the observation that moderate alcohol consumption, in particular red wine, is associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and an improved lipid profile [46–51]. In agreement with Tomè-Carneiro et al. (2012) [52] we observed that the consumption of red wine significantly decreases the level of ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) (P ≤ 0.",d7803253-41a6-43fc-b8f9-abbc061d9d20
19,methods19,"05), resulting in a more efficient endogenous antioxidant defense system, with the better protection from oxidative and inflammatory damage [53]. Polyphenols appear to interact with molecular signaling pathways and related cellular machinery that regulate processes such as inflammation and consequently oxidative status [54].  We investigate, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)), the expression of genes related to antioxidant defenses (silent information regulator (SIR)T2, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and GPx) and inflammation (CCL5) after consumption of MM and McD with or without red wine.  Particular attention was given to superoxide dismutase (superoxide dismutase (SOD)), catalase (catalase (CAT)), and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) for their fundamental role in reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) levels, thus protecting against cell/tissue damage [53, 55, 56].",73b3bd54-4db1-4f92-adaa-348aea37d010
20,methods20," We found that superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression did not significantly differ between intervention arms in our study, in agreement with Rodrigo et al. (2002) [18]. However, catalase (CAT) expression was upregulated after MM, MM + 250 mL red wine (MMRW), and McDRW, probably due to the enrichment of the meals with antioxidant compounds.  silent information regulator (SIR)T2 modulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and increases resistance to its damaging effects [57, 58]. It is interesting to observe the different levels of silent information regulator (SIR)T2 expression after consumption of the MM and McD, with and without red wine, likely attributable to amplified expression of silent information regulator (SIR)T2 in response to the resveratrol present in red wine, as suggested by Lagouge et al. (2006), Schirmer et al. (2012), and Mukherjee et al. (2009) [58–60].",b5e26734-bd97-41c8-b43a-38ae3631f23f
21,methods21,"  After McD and McDRW consumption, silent information regulator (SIR)T2 is expressed to a lesser extent than after MM, in agreement with Kim et al. (2013), where silent information regulator (SIR)T2 is upregulated in response to calorie restriction and oxidative stress, and promotes cell death under severe stress conditions via interaction with Forkhead Box proteins (FOXO)3a [56].  We observed a higher expression of silent information regulator (SIR)T2, after MM with red wine, which was negatively correlated (P < 0.001) with expression of CCL5, an important chemokine involved in inflammatory process. This result is in accordance with Lin et al. (2000) [61], who observed a protective effect of transduced PEP-1-silent information regulator (SIR)T2 against inflammation and oxidative stress in murine macrophages.",cfe0cc22-485d-48bf-afed-f16439e477a9
22,methods22," Our results are probably due to the antioxidant characteristics of this meal in association with the polyphenols of red wine, possibly representing an optimal nutritional combination. On the other hand, lower expression of silent information regulator (SIR)T2 in the McD is correlated (P < 0.001) with a high level of CCL5 expression. Lin et al. (2000) [61] and Zheng et al. [62] suggested that antioxidants effectively suppressed CCL5 mRNA expression, indicating that oxidation may be involved in the induction of the CCL5 gene expression by dengue-2-virus infection. In our results, CCL5 expression is lower after MM + 250 mL red wine (MMRW) consumption, which attests to the proposed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of red wine and food polyphenols.  A positive correlation (P < 0.",c2f56b51-0d97-43c2-9c95-0e683dabb37c
23,methods23,"001) between silent information regulator (SIR)T2 and catalase (CAT) was observed, in McD and MM + 250 mL red wine (MMRW), which may be due to silent information regulator (SIR)T2 increasing expression of catalase (CAT) [62]. To summarize, modulation of silent information regulator (SIR)T2 through diet may have a significant impact on the inflammation underlying chronic noncommunicable diseases.  On the other hand, consumption of a McD was related to prooxidant and proinflammatory activity, as demonstrated by the increase of low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and hyperexpression of the inflammatory CCL5 gene. Interestingly, associating red wine with the McD attenuates this effect.  5.",521e22dd-01a2-401e-9c99-7bb88cf4fe7e
24,methods24," Conclusion The effect of red wine in association with McDonald's and a Mediterranean Meal on ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) and gene expression was studied for the first time, with positive results indicating that the antioxidant potential of the nutrients found in red wine and the Mediterranean Diet may be an essential component of a holistic approach to combatting chronic noncommunicable diseases linked to inflammation.  However, prospective long-term data on consumption of a Mediterranean Diet as opposed to Western Diet (with or without red wine) on ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) and gene expression is not yet available and deserves further research in order to verify changes on body composition related to gene expression. Although the number of subjects enrolled in our study is acceptable in this instance [1], much greater numbers are required to definitively confirm these results.",f253dddb-0714-4464-9cb9-4de5af77dd3d
