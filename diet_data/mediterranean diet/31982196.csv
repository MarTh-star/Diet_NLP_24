0,introduction0,"At least 17.7 million adults in the US provide unpaid support to adults who are middle-aged or older.1 A report by the American Association of Retired Persons suggests that most of these unpaid caregivers are middle-aged women and 38% are members of minority groups.2,3 Often, they care for a spouse or other family member and assist with activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, and sometimes medically oriented tasks. In fact, data suggest that unpaid family caregivers provide as much as 90% of the in-home long-term care needed by adults in the US.4 In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caregivers have become even more important, providing essential care to individuals with comorbid conditions and disabilities in the home.5,6  The demands of caregiving can leave caregivers vulnerable to mental and physical health problems.",20a2223a-6751-47e2-a181-97c2532a332d
1,introduction1,"4,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 As such, the term caregiver strain (also known as caregiver burden) is defined as the extent to which caregivers perceive that caregiving has had an adverse effect on their emotional, social, financial, physical, and spiritual functioning.18 Studies have demonstrated that a high level of caregiver strain is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and lower levels of perceived health compared with a lesser level of strain.8,17,19,20 In addition, caregiver strain is associated with poor cardiovascular health.8 Moreover, some researchers have shown that strained caregivers have higher Framingham Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke Risk scores and a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome compared with noncaregiving sex-matched control participants without coronary heart disease.15,21,22,23,24 However, these findings have not been wholly consistent.",336fdda9-12c9-4d60-8eaa-7e0c086a4db7
2,introduction2," Other studies25,26 have revealed that a healthy caregiver phenomenon exists, whereby caregiving is associated with decreased mortality as compared with noncaregiving, perhaps suggesting that healthier persons are more likely to take on the caregiving role or that caregiving is associated with healthier behaviors.  Less is known about the association of caregiver strain with self-care practices for maintaining health by adult caregivers with diabetes. Recent reports suggest that nearly 20% of unpaid caregivers in the US have diabetes,22,27,28 a complex chronic disease that requires a high degree of self-care. Adults with diabetes are asked to maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, avoid smoking cigarettes, and take multiple medications for control of blood pressure and glucose and cholesterol levels.",b896beef-eee5-409d-888c-1f698cbeb49f
3,introduction3,"29,30,31,32,33,34 A systematic review32 of 72 studies of self-management among patients with diabetes revealed a positive association of self-management training with dietary habits and glycemic control. However, adhering to these recommendations and performing adequate self-care may be difficult for caregivers, particularly those who perceive strain.8 Although 1 qualitative study35 of Black women with diabetes reported that caregiving responsibilities were viewed as a barrier to participants’ diabetes self-care,35 quantitative data are limited.  To address this gap and to gain a better understanding of the association of caregiving with caregivers’ health, we examined the association between perceived caregiver strain and diabetes self-care among unpaid caregivers with diabetes, hypothesizing that those with higher levels of caregiver strain would report worse self-care.",6ce806b2-4efc-442d-831c-2f5d3107a266

26,discussion2," For example, a study of healthy middle-aged caregivers56 revealed that those with greater caregiving demands (eg, more individuals to care for, more hours spent caregiving per week) had less time for their own personal health needs. Second, strained caregivers may also assign more importance to the health of others than their own.56 In our study, caregivers reporting some strain had high adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Results of previous studies of nutrition in families and spousal pairs have suggested that health behavior interventions for 1 spouse can positively influence behavior of the other, particularly with regard to changes in family diet.57,58,59 In studies of spousal pairs in which 1 member had diabetes, the collective effort of both partners was found to be associated with better dietary adherence.",59cac878-da0a-474c-9f10-0160f612853e

Future longitudinal studies should seek to test these hypotheses and elucidate the underlying mechanisms that can explain the association between caregiver strain and self-care among caregivers with diabetes.  In adjusted analyses, we found that for some outcomes (physical activity, Mediterranean diet, and smoking status), the association with strain was attenuated after adjusting for sociodemographic factors; medical conditions; and overall physical and mental health, social support, and caregiving characteristics. Of note, however, for medication adherence, the association between a high level of strain and poor adherence persisted after these adjustments were made.

28,discussion4," Difficulty with medication adherence is often multifactorial because cost of medications, access to care, health beliefs regarding the safety and effectiveness of medications, and health literacy and numeracy are associated with adherence.61 However, beyond these underlying determinants, caregivers experiencing a high level of strain with varying responsibilities may not prioritize medication adherence, especially if medications need to be taken at certain times of the day or if a regimen is complex. In addition, although we were unable to assess health care utilization, caregivers experiencing a high level of strain may be less likely to prioritize attending their own physician appointments, and thus, opportunities to reinforce the need for medication adherence may be lost. Similarly, caregivers may not prioritize their own physical activity over their caregiving demands.",7f46127c-b664-48eb-a9ec-0ca03dec5d7e

At present, medical encounters in primary care are structured to prioritize patients and their needs. Although appropriate, this model often fails to engage and integrate caregivers who may be playing a vital role for patients in the home in addition to contending with their own medical conditions, which may impact their own and the care recipients’ health. Furthermore, the degree to which caregivers are involved or strained while providing care often goes unassessed.4,63 Increased awareness of caregiver strain among caregivers with diabetes appears to be needed by medical professionals because a high level of strain may be associated with alterations in caregivers’ behavior related to their own health.",91f975fa-93c7-4b0b-aeb0-43de1bab8cdf

Strengths and Limitations This study has strengths. The study included a large, geographically diverse cohort and oversampling of Black participants and had the ability to assess caregiver strain and characteristics among caregivers with diabetes. Furthermore, we were able to assess several domains of diabetes self-care.  This study also has limitations. Data collection occurred at 1 point in time. Therefore, we were unable to account for changes in caregiving intensity or strain or for changes in self-care behaviors that can occur for an individual throughout life. Second, diabetes status was ascertained at baseline by self-report of a physician diagnosis. Third, a small sample size of 510 used in the diabetes self-care score limits the power of this analysis.",17b3d123-f131-43bf-a070-581c55760446
32,discussion8,"  Conclusions In this cohort study of US adult caregivers with diabetes, a high level of caregiver strain was associated with worse self-care, particularly with respect to medication adherence, suggesting that high caregiving burden may interfere with caregivers’ self-care behaviors. Given the prevalence of caregiving in the US, increased awareness of the association of caregiver strain with self-care appears to be needed, particularly among those who have diabetes. Additional, prospective studies are needed to examine the association of our findings with health outcomes among caregivers with diabetes.  Supplement. eTable 1.
