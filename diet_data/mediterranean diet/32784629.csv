0,introduction0," Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is a group of debilitating, chronic, rheumatic diseases characterized by inflammation and new bone formation, mainly involving the spine and the sacroiliac joints. People living with axSpA often turn to lifestyle interventions to complement pharmacological treatment with a particular interest on diet [1]. Among environmental factors, diet has been suggested as a potential modifiable factor to improve inflammation in different rheumatic conditions [2–7]. Mediterranean diet (MD) has shown a protective role in terms of cardiovascular morbidity and overall mortality [6, 8].",31790a9a-485b-42f1-9ee5-400afd9232e2
1,introduction1," MD involves high consumption of olive oil, unrefined carbohydrates, fresh and dried fruit, vegetables, and fish; reduced intake of dairy products and red meat; and moderate red wine consumption; MD is very rich in antioxidants and particularly n-3 polyunsaturated fats, alpha-linoleic acid (alpha linoleic acid (ALA)), eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)), and docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)). There is evidence that in rheumatoid arthritis, these nutrients may have a beneficial effect by reducing inflammation, reducing pain and structural damage, and possibly reducing the incidence of the disease [8–13].  There is an unmet need to understand the effects of MD on axSpA, characterized by an increased cardiovascular risk [14–16]. A considerable issue in studies concerning the MD is to assess the adherence to MD.",f5330625-890f-42e8-9e28-9973f457fdee
2,introduction2," In the PREDIMED trial, a large case-control study on cardiovascular risk, a 14-item questionnaire was introduced with this aim: PREDIMED is consistent with other dietary questionnaires to evaluate MD and is more feasible in clinical practice [17].  We conducted a prospective study in a monocentric cohort of axSpA patients who received a 6-month nutritional advice based on the MD. We evaluated the impact of the nutritional advice on dietary habits, assessed with the PREDIMED questionnaire, and on axSpA disease activity in these patients compared to controls.  Patients and methods  AxSpA patients followed at the Padova University Hospital (Veneto Region, Italy) were offered advice by a nutritionist for a 6-month period, starting in May 2019. We collected the information of the patients in the nutritional group (N) and of a comparable group of consecutive axSpA patients who did not receive nutritional advice, controls (C).",24036e34-a4d8-48d3-9c96-eb902a29fece
3,introduction3," All patients were assessed every 6 months (T0 and T6) by a rheumatologist trained in the clinical assessment of axSpA and blinded to the study group. Patients in N underwent the nutritional evaluation in the day of the visits (T0 and T6) and in between every 2 months. Clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and assessment of the adherence to the MD and of cardiovascular risk were collected for all patients at T0 and T6.  Patients  We included patients who underwent two consecutive rheumatological assessments since May 2019. Only patients fulfilling the following criteria were included in the analysis: age ≥ 18 years, diagnosis of axial involvement (axSpA) according to ASAS 2009 criteria [18], and stable (≥ 6 months) biological/targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (b/tsDMARD) treatment. Exclusion criteria were rheumatological conditions other than axSpA, ongoing specific diet or optimal MD, and concomitant diabetes mellitus/metabolic syndrome.",4fb7fa18-a3db-4d14-9348-00fd7bf9ccd4
4,introduction4," Patients were allowed to change treatment in case of suboptimal disease control. However, in order to ensure a homogenous cohort of patients with stable treatment, patients with very high disease activity (i.e., Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)-C reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 3.5) were excluded. Eighty-one patients in N and 80 controls were consecutively enrolled.  The local medical ethical committee approved the study (Protocol No. 52723), and informed consent was obtained from all patients at study inclusion. The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975/1983.  Nutritional advice  Patients in N underwent an interview with a nutritionist at T0. Dietary habits were assessed through the PREDIMED questionnaire [17] and through a 24-h recall of meals consumed the previous day. Based on these evaluations, the nutritionist suggested dietary modifications in order to improve their adherence to the MD.",c2f0a5ff-04e7-4b56-af3a-0467742fe643
5,introduction5," Key recommendations of the nutritionist were as follows: fractionate daily caloric intake into 3 main meals and two snacks; ensure a daily caloric intake mainly consisting of carbohydrates (55%) preferably with low glycemic index, followed by fats (20–30%) and proteins (10–15%); include adequate amounts of fibers (25–30 g daily) and water (1.5–2 l daily); consumption of vegetables, fruits, sugar-free cereals, and olive oil in every meal; use of olive oil as the main culinary fat; daily consumption of low-fat dairy products and nuts and a moderate wine consumption; weekly consumption of fish, white meat, and legumes; reduced weekly consumption of red meat, eggs, and potatoes; limit the use of salt; and only occasional consume of pastries, sweets, and soft drinks. Importantly, adoption of a non-sedentary lifestyle and regular physical activity were also recommended (Additional file 1) [18].",00ab3561-ac3f-4508-801f-fb5c93b0ddda
6,introduction6," Every 2 months, the nutritionist asked the patients about their dietary habits and recalled the dietary modifications suggested at T0.

Cardiovascular risk assessment  Cardiovascular risk assessment in this study was evaluated with the systematic coronary risk evaluation (systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE)) and CUORE indices at T0 and T6. In chronic inflammatory arthritis, systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE) for the appropriate country (i.e., low-risk countries for Italy) is recommended [20]; alternatively, the cardiovascular risk index recommended by national guidelines may be used, such as the Italian CUORE [21].

An improvement ≥ 20% of the T0 value was considered as a positive outcome. As a measure of clinical improvement, the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)-C reactive protein (CRP) index was considered, which comprehends both clinical and laboratory measures [22]. The C reactive protein (CRP)-based index was also chosen, since it is required for the medical prescription of rheumatological treatments in the Veneto Region.

29,discussion1," The main reason for lost-to-follow-up was the isolation protocol during the COVID-19 emergency in Italy in February–April 2020.  An overall moderate adherence to the MD emerged at baseline in the entire cohort with most of the patients reporting a moderate adherence to MD. This finding is consistent with a study conducted in another Italian cohort of psoriatic arthritis patients showing very similar baseline PREDIMED score and only a few patients with optimal adherence to MD [24]. After 6 months, half of the patients in the nutritional group improved their adherence to MD, and the percentage of patients showing a PREDIMED improvement ≥ 20% as compared to baseline was higher in the nutritional group than in controls. Such small changes in the PREDIMED total score were expected given that a small number of subjects are indeed reported to effectively modify their diet following a nutritional intervention over a 6–12-month period [17, 25].",18b42430-dacf-480a-a671-b4fc712982d5
30,discussion2," Regarding specific nutrients, following nutritional advice, patients increased their olive oil, fruit, vegetables, and mixed nuts intake. Health improvements relating the specific food intake are not comparable with studies conducted in different countries, given the array of dietary habits compared to Italy [26, 27].  The multivariable analysis revealed that receiving nutritional advice increased by almost 5-fold the odds of achieving a ≥ 20% improvement in adherence to MD. The patients in the nutritional group have therefore undoubtedly benefitted from the suggestions provided by the nutritionist. Also, tight follow-up with frequent assessments may have improved the adherence to the given dietary recommendations. Patients with a lower body mass index (BMI) were more prone to achieve a PREDIMED improvement, which may reflect the fact that patients with an already good dietary control are more acquainted with food management and with the specific nutritional properties of the food.",fef22d68-e972-480b-9c70-db5407640b8a
31,discussion3," In addition, we observed that older patients (i.e., in their fifties) were more prone to improve their diet. This may be due to various factors: older patients may have more time to prepare meals according to the suggestion of the nutritionist, or could also be more compliant to the physician’s prescription.  No significant reduction in body mass index (BMI) was observed in any of the study groups, which was expected given the short duration of the study and mostly because the diet was not aimed at reducing the caloric intake. Notably, some studies in rheumatoid arthritis suggested that a slight increase in weight may also occur following MD introduction [28]. That being so, a stable body mass index (BMI) has not prejudiced the observed variations of disease activity in this study, which can be attributed to the diet modification [29].  A slight worsening of HbA1c was observed in the patients receiving nutritional advice.",d2fef84d-65a8-489a-bf3f-c6071aef7cba
32,discussion4," This finding may be explained by the fact that the MD may induce a higher glucidic intake compared to other diets which recommend a lower carbohydrate intake. We hypothesized that nutritional advice promoting low sugar intake (including non-sugary cereals) and complex carbohydrates with low glycemic index may be beneficial. Another possible explanation is that patients may have consumed predominantly fruits with a high glycemic index.  Adherence to MD emerged as the most significant predictor of improved disease activity in our study (≥ 20% vs. baseline, PREDIMED), resulting in a 7-fold increased likelihood of improving Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)-C reactive protein (CRP) as well.",ca9d3017-f99e-4047-9eff-b4a9310fbfd9
33,discussion5,"  Previous studies on MD nutritional interventions in rheumatic diseases have shown a beneficial effect on disease control and possibly a reduced incidence of inflammatory arthritis [2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 18, 22, 23, 25], though no comparable studies are currently available in axSpA patients. A recent Italian cross-sectional study, limited to psoriatic arthritis patients, confirmed the association between a better adherence to MD and improved clinical activity indices [24]. Two studies conducted in England and in Sweden showed that the implementation of MD in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was mainly associated with an improved perception of pain and disease activity but also clinical indices (e.g., C reactive protein (CRP)) [26, 27]. Likewise, in our study, both the patient’s evaluation (on a visual analogic scale (VAS) scale) and the laboratory measures of inflammation (i.e., C reactive protein (CRP)) improved in the patients who initiated MD.",bd1da3b8-0b96-4d2a-91f6-62038e749e25
34,discussion6,"  This improvement may be attributed to specific MD nutrients. During the study, patients receiving nutritional advice increased the consumption of olive oil and nuts which are rich in oleic acid and other n-3 polyunsaturated fats. There is evidence that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation—eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), found in fish oil—associates with better disease activity scores in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [3, 11, 13]. These findings are further corroborated by studies showing that olive oil reduces inflammatory cytokine production and autoantibody development, increases T regulatory cell activation, and decreases Th17 response [7, 8, 30]. Furthermore, saturated fats and dietary fibers may also have an immunomodulatory effect on the gut microbiome in patients with autoimmune diseases [31].",8d7e7841-1208-4493-8385-86d53edab85d
35,discussion7,"  Notably, although physical activity was not an outcome of the study, patients receiving nutritional advice more frequently reported increased physical activity as compared to controls. Physical activity reduces fatigue and improves sleep and innate immunity in SpA and rheumatoid arthritis patients [32, 33].  Psoriasis was negatively associated to Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)-C reactive protein (CRP) improvement, although this finding was not significant. Patients with psoriasis are known to have a heterogeneous disease, often representing a challenge for the rheumatologist [34]. Furthermore, these patients are often overweight, with an overlapping metabolic syndrome and a higher cardiovascular risk [14–16, 35–40]. Probably, axSpA patients with psoriasis will need studies with specific nutritional interventions.",91ece5bb-3d61-401e-b4ef-97eabad8b191
36,discussion8,"  Overall, a low cardiovascular risk was observed in all SpA patients in our cohort, irrespective of their diet, in line with previous findings of lower cardiovascular risk linked to Southern European diets [41, 42]. The lipid profile did not improve in our study nor did the blood pressure or systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE) and CUORE indices, which may be attributed to the short time of the study. Except from an improvement in blood pressure following a 6-week MD intervention in rheumatoid arthritis [26], no other study reports improvements of cardiovascular risk factors over a short time in rheumatic diseases and specifically in SpA [15].  The first limitation of this study is that the adherence to the MD was evaluated based on a questionnaire given to the patient and not with a regular meal control and hospital admission as in other studies in rheumatoid arthritis [27]. Questionnaires are prone to biased results from socially desirable answering [43].",e267ffb1-6d47-4cdf-9182-44b8a545f573
37,discussion9," Nonetheless, the adoption of a questionnaire allows to conduct a study in a large cohort of patients and is necessary to recall the dietary habits of the patients. Secondly, a 6-month study period may be regarded as a short time to evaluate diet and disease improvement following a dietary modification. An intrinsic problem of all studies considering nutritional intervention is to ensure an adequate and persistent adherence to the dietary modifications designed by the nutritionist: it has to be considered that a 6-month study challenges the patients’ compliance, making it difficult to maintain strict control over their eating habits for the course of study. This difficulty was one of the main reasons of drop-outs from the study, which was also affected by the isolation measures during the COVID emergency.",de36da02-43a5-4ef0-a8c1-d4217f1d094e
38,discussion10,"  Conclusions  To date, this study is the first describing the effects of the MD in patients suffering from axSpA and reporting a successful modification of dietary habits and a trend toward an improvement of disease assessment. Higher body mass index (BMI) and a younger age patients affected by axSpA are less prone to modify their diet towards the Mediterranean diet following nutritional advice. A better adherence to the Mediterranean diet may improve disease activity in axSpA; nonetheless, patients with psoriasis may have a limited benefit from a dietary improvement. The results may be relevant for personalized treatment approaches for axSpA patients.  Supplementary Information  Additional file 1.
