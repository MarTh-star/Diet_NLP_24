0,introduction0,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator, involved in the regulation of vascular homeostasis. NO inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion, leukocyte—endothelial cell interaction and smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration [1,2]. In the last years, several studies demonstrated that endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation is reduced in various diseases, such as diabetes, heart failure, coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)), hypertension, atherosclerosis and chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease (CKD)). In these pathologic conditions, NO bioavailability is reduced by oxidation due to excessive production of superoxide anions in the vascular wall, suggesting that antioxidant compounds may have a role in the modulation of endothelial-dependent vasodilatation [3–5].  Epidemiological studies reported that a diet enriched in vegetables and fruits may contribute to reduce the incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease [6,7].",6f307dbc-7e06-42ca-be65-421799f193bf
1,introduction1," In particular, a significant reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) was observed in certain areas of France where fat intake is high, leading to the concept of the “French paradox” [8]. The Mediterranean diet, which is characterized by food containing phenols, was also correlated with a reduced incidence and delayed progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [9,10]. Further studies evidenced a protective effect of dietary intake of phenols contained in red [11,12] or white wine [13–15], and olive oil [16,17]. It has been reported that wine-derived phenols may reduce endothelial dysfunction by enhancing NO availability and/or generation [18–20]. Oral administration of red wine polyphenolic compounds decreased blood pressure in hypertensive rats. This hemodynamic effect was associated with an enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxation and stimulation of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 gene expression within the arterial walls [21].",e0921eb3-2893-4bae-b3fb-c6baa9efaa56
2,introduction2," The cardioprotective activity of red wine has been ascribed mainly to phytocomplex rich in polyphenols, in particular resveratrol (resveratrol (RSV)). However, several reports indicated that also white wine may exert cardiovascular protective effects despite the very low content of resveratrol (RSV) [22–25]. White wine contains phenols with antioxidant properties such as Caffeic Acid (Caffeic acid (CAF)) and Tyrosol (Tyrosol (TYR)). In particular, Prasad and co-workers [26] reported that Caffeic acid (CAF) significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and decreased DNA damage in UVB-irradiated lymphocytes. Furthermore, Caffeic acid (CAF) pre-treatment significantly maintains antioxidant status and decreased UVB-induced cytotoxicity[26]. Moreover, Khan et al. [27,28] demonstrated that Caffeic acid (CAF) can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate in vivo.",a45d6aa1-7f7b-4477-ad4c-10287070d449
3,introduction3," However, the effect of these compounds on NO production has not been extensively investigated.  The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether low doses of Caffeic acid (CAF) comparable to those assumed with moderate white wine consumption may exert a protective effect on endothelial injury induced by hypoxia and uremic toxins.

38,discussion0,"In the present study, we demonstrated that Caffeic acid (CAF) modulates endothelial NO production in a dose-dependent manner. These results may suggest a potential role of Caffeic acid (CAF) in the inhibition of oxidant stress-associated endothelial dysfunction induced by hypoxia or by incubation with the uremic toxins and calcification [58] Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate. This potential protective effect of Caffeic acid (CAF) was confirmed in an experimental model of kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury in which this compound significantly reduced tubular cell apoptosis and granulocyte infiltration.  We first observed that Caffeic acid (CAF) induced an enhancement of basal and Ach-induced NO production by Human umbilical vein derived endothelial cells (HUVEC)s. This effect was not due to an increased expression of eNOS but rather to a scavenger. activity of Caffeic acid (CAF).",9fd5f84a-a2aa-4fdb-b927-ef36008283a1
39,discussion1," Indeed, we did not observe an increased phosphorylation of eNOS in endothelial cells treated with Caffeic acid (CAF), suggesting that NO production was not directly stimulated by this compound. Furthermore, the experiments performed with the pro-oxidant A23187 confirmed the anti-oxidant and scavenger activity of Caffeic acid (CAF).  Previous studies demonstrated that Caffeic acid (CAF) has a potential anti-atherogenic activity through the reduction of cell adhesion molecule expression and chemokine production by Human umbilical vein derived endothelial cells (HUVEC)s incubated with inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α [41]. In the present study, we demonstrated that Caffeic acid (CAF), at doses comparable with those observed after moderate white wine consumption [42–43], induced NO production in endothelial cells [28, 42, 44, 45].",b2a991b0-4633-4206-bc23-d6d4af651901
40,discussion2," The efficacy of Caffeic acid (CAF) in modulating NO metabolism has also been recently confirmed in an experimental model of cerebral infarction in adult male New Zealand rabbits [46]. These results are in accordance with previous studies showing Caffeic acid (CAF)-induced vasorelaxation in isolated rat aorta [47], whereas other phenols such as Tyrosol (TYR) were ineffective [48]. Tyrosol (TYR) is an extensively investigated phenol present in wine and olive oil, main components of the Mediterranean diet. Tyrosol (TYR) is known to exert anti-oxidant activities in different in vitro studies and experimental models [48]. Our results confirmed the anti-oxidant properties of Tyrosol (TYR).",6e359d1e-b273-442e-a40b-7f0a544c5417
41,discussion3," However, Tyrosol (TYR) was less effective than Caffeic acid (CAF) in NO production by Human umbilical vein derived endothelial cells (HUVEC)s, suggesting that Caffeic acid (CAF) may be one of the key mediators involved in the reduction of endothelial dysfunction observed in subjects adherent to Mediterranean diet [49].  The typical endothelial dysfunction could be ascribed either to eNOS inhibition or to an increased superoxide production [50]. In our experiments, the increase of endothelial NO bioavailability induced by Caffeic acid (CAF) was not due to an enhancement of eNOS expression but rather to an anti-oxidant activity in accordance with previous studies [51].",bba65535-4b2c-42c5-b4da-7606ad57af32
42,discussion4," Basing on these observations, we investigated the protective effect of Caffeic acid (CAF) on oxidant stress-induced endothelial dysfunction in two different in vitro models using Human umbilical vein derived endothelial cells (HUVEC)s cultured under hypoxia or with known uremic toxins such as and calcification [58] Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate. Indeed, hypoxia as well as uremic toxins plays a crucial role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression through a pro-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic activity on endothelial cells [52].  We observed that increasing doses of Caffeic acid (CAF) reduced the cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effect induced by hypoxia on Human umbilical vein derived endothelial cells (HUVEC)s.",dea836d3-d530-4bca-846f-833b239a0c47
43,discussion5," Moreover, Caffeic acid (CAF) significantly reduced the adhesion of leukocytes on hypoxia-stimulated Human umbilical vein derived endothelial cells (HUVEC) monolayers, suggesting a role in the inhibition of the inflammatory endothelial response typical of ischemia-reperfusion injury [53]. Indeed, in the present study, we found that in an experimental model of acute kidney injury (acute kidney injury (AKI)) due to ischemia-reperfusion, Caffeic acid (CAF) significantly reduced the percentage of tubular cell apoptosis as well as the number of infiltrating granulocytes. These results suggest a dual protective role of Caffeic acid (CAF) on hypoxia-associated tubular injury and inflammation.  Ischemic-induced tissue hypoxia is a condition shared by different pathologic conditions associated with endothelial dysfunction including acute kidney injury (AKI), coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) [53].",03bce3e8-f93a-49df-a21b-736c76bf7e1e
44,discussion6," Indeed, it has been shown that alteration of oxygen pathways and NO play a key role in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (acute kidney injury (AKI)) and in the cellular mechanisms of progression toward chronic kidney disease (CKD) [54]. In particular, chronic hypoxia in the renal tubulo-interstitial compartment is responsible for the hemodynamic changes and for the altered oxygen metabolism of resident kidney cells that lead to the typical histological findings of chronic kidney disease (CKD) such as peritubular capillary rarefaction, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis [55]. Hypoxia causes endothelial apoptosis and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through the increased expression of extracellular matrix proteins and oxidative genes [56]. Moreover, it has been shown that uremia induces an alteration of oxygen consumption in kidney resident cells leading to the deterioration of renal function through oxidative stress [55–56].",44588997-264e-4a19-afd8-747e9b0c117a
45,discussion7," Our results suggest a protective effect of Caffeic acid (CAF) in the course of events leading to oxidative stress-induced endothelial injury and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in presence of hypoxia. In addition, it has been shown that several uremic toxins, biologically active uremic retention molecules known to accelerate renal dysfunction, are able to deregulate oxygen metabolism, thus worsening the hypoxic damage and the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [57]. Among uremic toxins, guanidino compounds are known to induce endothelial production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), cytotoxicity and calcification [58]. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (and calcification [58] Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)) is a key mediator of uremia-associated endothelial dysfunction and triggering of atherosclerosis.",8cf6e2e0-eb7f-4d78-bd46-c9cb99edf056
46,discussion8," and calcification [58] Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous L-arginine analogue acting as inhibitor of NO synthase whose levels are significantly increased in end stage renal disease patients. In addition, elevated and calcification [58] Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels are associated with an enhancement of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and with an increased incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases due to oxidative stress damage [59]. Other protein bound uremic toxins such as p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate are increased in uremic patients and are known to induce an intense production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and senescence of endothelial cells [60]. Moreover, indoxyl sulfate inhibits NO production and facilitate leukocyte endothelial interaction through the up-regulation of E-selectin, ICAM-1 and MCP-1 on endothelial cell surface [61].",b69ea336-05af-4693-a988-c599b20cfcbe
47,discussion9," A similar effect of indoxyl sulfate as well as of p-cresyl sulfate has also been observed on kidney tubular epithelial cells through Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production, activation of NF-kB and p53 and production of TGF-beta able to enhance the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [62]. As described for hypoxia-induced damage, we found that Caffeic acid (CAF), at low doses present in the white wine, protected endothelial cells from apoptosis and functional alterations induced by and calcification [58] Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate at levels found in the uremic milieu. In particular, Caffeic acid (CAF) increased cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and in vitro angiogenesis that were all reduced after treatment with uremic toxins. In addition, Caffeic acid (CAF) significantly reduced the adhesion of leukocyte to Human umbilical vein derived endothelial cells (HUVEC)s incubated with uremic toxins.",d0ff87e7-4af8-444b-9238-bee41728bb5b
48,discussion10,"  Caffeic acid (CAF)-associated endothelial protection was mainly ascribed to the inhibition of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) expression and to the increase of NO release. However, gene array analysis revealed that Caffeic acid (CAF) was able to modulate the endothelial expression of several genes involved in angiogenesis and inhibition of apoptosis of hypoxic endothelial cells independently by NO production. In particular, Caffeic acid (CAF) induced the endothelial expression of different growth factors and angiogenic molecules such as angiopoietin-1, EGF, FGF, HGF, IGF-1, IL-6, VEGF, MMP-2 and growth factor receptors including FGF-R, Flt1 and KDR.  In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that Caffeic acid (CAF)-induced NO bioavaibility and inhibition of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production may explain, at least in part, the potential endothelial protection associated with moderate white wine assumption typical of Mediterranean diet.",b2d7da44-cc34-40d6-8965-101f9d8eebce
49,discussion11, The Caffeic acid (CAF)-induced inhibition of the inflammatory and apoptotic injury and the triggering of angiogenesis of Human umbilical vein derived endothelial cells (HUVEC)s may be responsible for a cardio-protective and reno-protective effect of this phenol due to the limitation of oxidant stress-induced microvascular derangement in presence of hypoxia and/or uremic toxins.
