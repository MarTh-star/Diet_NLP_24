0,introduction0,"Numerous prenatal environmental exposures including smoking, stress, maternal obesity, and dietary factors have been associated with health and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children (Huizink et al., 2002; Wiebe et al., 2009; Steenweg-de Graaff et al., 2012; Gartstein and Skinner, 2017), with some exposures conferring life-long associations . In a recent meta-analysis, pre-pregnancy obesity was estimated to be associated with a 51% increased risk of any neurodevelopmental impairment and a 62% increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)) symptoms or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) related impairments . Prenatal nutrition may also have lasting effects on child neurodevelopment .",5e084754-bff3-4ae2-8e9b-8a39898bc6b7
1,introduction1," While extensive research concerning maternal obesity, gestational weight gain, and child behavior has been conducted [for reviews see (Rivera et al., 2015; Contu and Hawkes, 2017; Sanchez et al., 2017)], less is known about particular types of maternal diets in humans and their effects on early childhood behavior.  Numerous studies suggest that there may be beneficial effects of maternal diet in pregnancy on child neurodevelopment, albeit, again with mixed results . Intakes of antioxidants, n-3 fatty acids, and foods rich in these nutrients have been associated with child developmental outcomes with inconsistent findings (Guxens et al., 2012; Brew et al., 2015; Delgado-Noguera et al., 2015; Emmett et al., 2015; Bolduc et al., 2016; Catena et al., 2016; Ishikawa et al., 2016; Julvez et al., 2016; Bruce-Keller et al., 2017; Lipton et al., 2017).  Far fewer studies have examined overall diet patterns .",9aed8585-0b1e-4834-b0b8-d86efb19bc1c
2,introduction2," Among 23,020 children in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, Jacka et al. (2013) reported that “unhealthy” maternal diet patterns during pregnancy were associated with increased externalizing child behaviors. A recent study in the United Kingdom suggested that maternal diets characterized by higher intakes of fruits and vegetables and lower intakes of meat and potatoes are associated with higher child IQ at age 8 years (Freitas-Vilela et al., 2017). In the Generation R study involving 3,104 children, investigators reported decreased levels of externalizing behaviors from children born to mothers who adhered to a Mediterranean diet during pregnancy, and increased child externalizing behaviors in children born to mothers who consumed a “Traditionally Dutch” diet consisting of high meat intake (processed and unprocessed), margarines and potatoes (Steenweg-de Graaff et al., 2014).",0107abfe-19d7-4a9d-a81e-5cbf15746877
3,introduction3,"  Precise definitions for the “Mediterranean diet” vary, but all share the following similarities: rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes; higher amounts of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) such as olive oil, whole grains, and fish, while sparse in meat (Trichopoulou et al., 2003; Bach et al., 2006; Sofi, 2009; Korre et al., 2014). The Mediterranean diet has long been associated with a myriad of positive outcomes, both observationally and in randomized controlled trials. These include improved cognition in adults , as well as reductions in cancer mortality (Trichopoulou et al., 2003; Schwingshackl et al., 2011; Dilis et al., 2012), all-cause mortality (Trichopoulou et al., 2003; Knoops et al., 2004; Panagiotakos et al., 2006), cardiovascular/chronic heart disease (CVD/CHD) mortality and morbidity (Renaud et al., 1995; Estruch et al., 2006; Martínez-González et al., 2008; Fung et al., 2009; Sofi, 2009; Kastorini et al.",c328f1f8-c60a-4db5-a2dc-914ff70455ec

In children, Mediterranean diet adherence (Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA)) has been associated with reduced odds of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and improved school performance (Esteban-Cornejo et al., 2016; Rios-Hernandez et al., 2017).  Although mechanisms linking Mediterranean diet and outcomes are still unclear, epigenetic modifications are hypothesized as one mechanism to explain associations between environmental cues such as maternal diet, and child temperament/behavior (Harper, 2005; Lee, 2015; Arpon et al.",0f1a58f3-fb40-40e8-aa6a-93706d35e04b
5,introduction5,", 2016; Lorite Mingot et al., 2017); for review see (Lillycrop and Burdge, 2015). Animal studies have demonstrated changes in DNA methylation in the offspring of mice from dams fed different diets during pregnancy . In addition, dietary choline deficiency in dams has been shown to alter methylation patterns in mouse fetal brains . In humans, low maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) has recently been associated with altered CpG methylation of the imprinted MEG3-IG control region in female offspring (Gonzalez-Nahm et al., 2017). In other studies, imprinted IGF2 was altered at birth in offspring with periconceptional exposure to famine during world war II (1944–1945) . Additional support for epigenetics as a mechanism for modulating behavior in humans is recent work identifying altered methylation in brain associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (Xiao et al.",c630e517-39a8-485e-af80-673b358eaff4

(2016) relating methylation of the regulatory regions of imprinted genes with infant temperament.  Sex-specific methylation differences are common in the genome . As shown in Gonzalez-Nahm’s work (Gonzalez-Nahm et al., 2017), differential methylation of imprinted genes from maternal dietary exposures in offspring can also be sex-specific. Additional evidence for sex-specific differences in the methylation of imprinted control regions (ICRs) in response to prenatal exposures comes from work showing that female infants, but not males, exhibited differential methylation of ICRs of IGF2 and H19 in response to maternal anxiety .",ae776ae4-3493-472f-807a-6b8b0481c261
7,introduction7," Likewise, lead exposures have been associated with sex-specific changes to the methylation patterns in multiple ICRs (Goodrich et al., 2015; Li Y. et al., 2016), and while not statistically significant, sex-specific differential methylation of the H19 and IFG2 DMRs were associated with prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke (Murphy et al., 2012a).  In the current study, we sought to test the hypothesis that maternal adherence to a dietary pattern favorably associated with multiple health outcomes (Mediterranean) would be associated with offspring behavior and changes in methylation of ICRs, many of which have been associated with other behavioral offspring outcomes from prenatal exposures.

8,methods0," Among 325 mother/infant pairs, we used regression models to evaluate the association between tertiles of maternal periconceptional Mediterranean diet adherence (Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA)) scores derived from a Food Frequency Questionnaire, and social and emotional scores derived from the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA)) questionnaire in the second year of life. Methylation of nine genomically imprinted genes was measured to determine if Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) was associated with CpG methylation.  Newborn Epigenetics STudy (NEST) Cohort and Study Population Study participants included mother and infant dyads enrolled in the Newborn Epigenetics STudy (Newborn Epigenetics STudy (NEST)), a prospective cohort for which accrual protocols have been previously described in detail .",2be6b450-db5f-478d-a3e4-114f0278bb7e

To be included, women had to be aged 18 years and older and speak English or Spanish. From these, women with an established HIV infection or who intended to relinquish custody of offspring were excluded. To facilitate specimen collection at birth, women who receive obstetrics care at hospitals other than Duke Obstetrics or Durham Regional Hospitals were also excluded. Between 2009 and 2011, 1700 pregnant women were enrolled, and 396 were lost to the cohort due to fetal wastage (n = 113), refusal of further participation (n = 146), received obstetric care at an outside hospital (n = 114), or other reasons (n = 23), such that 1,304 (76.7%) women remained enrolled in the study up to the time of analysis.

Because we were interested in maternal diet and because of the potential epigenetic vulnerability due to the requirement to maintain methylation at imprinted DMRs during the reprogramming that occurs immediately post-fertilization, mothers were specifically asked to recall foods consumed at or near their last menstrual cycle. food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) responses were converted to intakes of foods, food groups, energy, and nutrients by Nutrition Quest1.",d4e18602-fe2e-4a85-88b5-120784e17b21

The Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) tool has been validated and used extensively to examine social-emotional behavioral outcomes and temperament in early-childhood (Carter et al., 2003, 2010). Scales of the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) have demonstrated acceptable test–retest reliability and inter-rater reliability; Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for the internalizing and externalizing domains were 0.80 and 0.86, respectively .",b034a946-fee6-4b9e-a2a9-bcbfef6bc51e

In addition, the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) contains 13 questions to assess Maladaptive behavior, 10 questions to assess Social-Relatedness behavior and 8 questions to assess Atypical behavior. We also examined a composite autism spectrum disorder index calculated from the problem and competency portions of the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) as described in Kruizinga et al.

Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment questions are scored from 0 to 2 (0 = Not True/Rarely, 1 = Somewhat, 2 = Very True/Often) and final domains are scaled by the number of questions in the domain. To examine associations of diet on Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) assessed child behaviors (Figure 1), and as many items were not normally distributed, even after log-transformation (Supplementary Figure 1), Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) behavior scores were divided into tertiles and associations with dietary exposures were assessed using ordinal logistic regression. We did not assess the peer aggression subscale of externalizing behavior due to lack of non-zero scoring (>2/3 of data were zero; data not shown).",2827f97f-097c-4bea-bb6a-66e983f8afeb

In brief, intakes of food categories were adjusted by total energy to grams/1000 kcals and a modified version of Trichopoulou’s Mediterranean diet scoring was used . Participants were scored a 0 for below-median consumption of meats (including red meat, pork, poultry, game, but excluding processed meats) and a 1 for above-median consumption of the following: fruit (including fresh, dried and frozen, but excluding juice), vegetables (excluding vegetable juice and white potatoes), fish, dairy (including full-fat dairy but excluding dairy desserts), whole grains, nuts and seeds (including nut-butters), beans and legumes (including soy), and the ratio of mono-unsaturated fat to saturated fat.",1bfc3a57-83d8-4529-9759-c2220cb50eab
16,methods8," Alcohol consumption was not scored as it is not recommended during pregnancy and was extremely low in this cohort. The final Mediterranean diet score ranged from 0 to 9 with 9 as most adherent (Supplementary Figure 2). This composite Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score was divided into tertiles (referent = first tertile) and subsequently used to assess associations of Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) with child behaviors. The normal distribution of these scores (Supplementary Figure 2) was maintained by offspring sex and by the sub-cohort used to assess associations of maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) on CpG methylation.  DNA Methylation Assessment For n = 142 children of the 325 included, 800 ng of genomic DNA from umbilical cord-blood was treated with sodium bisulfite. Treated DNA (40 ng) was used for bisulfite pyrosequencing (Fuemmeler et al., 2016; Gonzalez-Nahm et al.",d3b89db5-70f9-4142-b0f9-e50e22664201

These regions are described in detail elsewhere , as are complete assay conditions including primers and post-assay quality control (Murphy et al., 2012b; Nye et al., 2013; Gonzalez-Nahm et al., 2017). For the assessment of Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) on methylation, the number of subjects with maternal dietary information, all covariates, and cord blood methylation varied.  Statistical Analysis For analysis of child behavioral outcomes, the following maternal covariates were included: age at delivery, education level (any college vs. none) pre-pregnancy obesity (BMI > 30 vs.",9b013e06-8257-4ff7-8149-a44516afc71c

We also adjusted for paternal age as well as child sex, child birthweight, full term status (≥37 weeks gestation or not), parity (nulliparous vs. not), and age of Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) assessment (Table 1). As neither post-birth-breastfeeding-status nor child age at Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) would be expected to impact cord-blood methylation patterns, these covariates were removed for assessment of associations of diet with differentially methylated imprinted gene DMR CpGs in cord-blood.

Trend tests were conducted with ordinal logistic regression on tertiles of behavioral outcome while treating tertiles of maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) exposure as a linear predictor (1 = least adherent, 3 = most adherent). In results, unless otherwise specified, trend p-values are not adjusted. For assessing the relationship between maternal dietary adherence and the percent methylation of CpGs (continuous) as well as the relationship between percent methylation of CpGs and child behavior (continuous), linear regression was conducted using lm() from the base R stats package.

The permutation analyses used covariate-residualized of responses, permuted relative to the covariate-residualized predictors of interest. An alternate analysis used 10,000 permutations of DMR β values vs. maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA), covariate-residualized and using the partial correlations as the test statistic.

CpG Methylation and Child Behavior For the significant associations of maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) on offspring behavior (Figure 1) and maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) on methylation of imprinted gene control regions (Figure 2), we examined associations of mean methylation on child behaviors (Supplementary Figure 5).",dbedb2fa-ea4f-4340-a8b4-3dd1a5566c55
32,results12," In males, increased methylation of IGF2 was associated with increased Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Composite Index behaviors and increased Atypical behavior, increased methylation of MEG3 was associated with increased Social Relatedness and decreased Maladaptive behaviors, increased methylation of SGCE/PEG10 was associated with increased Atypical behavior, while increased methylation of the PLAGL1 DMR was associated with increased Atypical and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Composite Index behaviors (Supplementary Figure 5). In females, increased methylation of the control region of SGCE/PEG10 was associated with decreased risk of depression, anxiety, and atypical behaviors. These estimates were unstable as evidenced by large confidence bounds and we were underpowered to conduct mediation analyses.",4223f14c-b24f-428d-bdda-f16452175d78
33,results13," In spite of this, we were able to identify multiple consistent associations of maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) on child behavior, of maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) on differential methylation of imprinted gene control regions, and of these DMRs on child behavior (Figure 3).  FIGURE 3 Sex Specific Maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) and CpG Associations on Child Behavior. In females (orange), maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) is associated with increased methylation in the control region of SGCE/PEG10 locus. In turn, this is associated with decreased odds of depression, anxiety, atypical, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)) composite index behaviors, as is maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA).",33637cfc-337c-43f8-b4ec-89d8c70743d4
34,results14," In males (green), maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) is associated with hypo-methylation of the control region of IGF2 and SGCE/PEG10 loci and hyper-methylation of the MEG3 control region which are, in turn, are consistently associated with maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) associations on atypical and social relatedness behaviors.

35,discussion0,"While much research has been conducted on the role of individual nutrients or foods on child outcomes, few studies have examined the potential role of the overall quality of maternal diet during pregnancy on child behavioral and other neurodevelopmental outcomes ; the results so far are limited. In this study of a subset of the ethnically diverse Newborn Epigenetics STudy (NEST) cohort, we observed a reduced risk of adverse child behaviors in relation to maternal diet patterns around the time of conception. Maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) was associated with child social relatedness behaviors, and inversely associated with the internalization subscales of depression and anxiety. Further, maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) was inversely associated with atypical, maladaptive, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) behavioral patterns.",48f5b7ee-b4a6-41f3-a4fa-1ceaeaed7a52
36,discussion1," To minimize maternal depression as a potential confounder of the association between maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) and offspring depression (Figure 1), we included maternal post-natal depression in our adjusted model and estimates were materially unchanged (data not shown). In addition, although covariate proportions differed (except sex and child birthweight), between our cohort and the parent cohort (data not shown), estimates for our significant findings were materially unchanged between unadjusted and adjusted models (Figure 1).  Our results suggest that during pregnancy, maternal adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, rich in legumes, vegetables, fish, and healthy fatty acids, and lower in red meat, may promote behavioral and emotional well-being in children.",d34c4541-fe55-456e-85e2-22a267f41165
37,discussion2," These findings are consistent with earlier studies reporting that maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA), or to a dietary principal components pattern characterized as “healthy,” is beneficially associated with child behavioral and emotional problems (Jacka et al., 2013; Steenweg-de Graaff et al., 2014). In adults, adherence to this diet pattern is associated with better cognitive outcomes and decreased depression, suggesting a role of diet on cognition and emotional functioning (Crichton et al., 2013; Rienks et al., 2013; Trovato et al., 2014; Hardman et al., 2016; Aridi et al., 2017; Loughrey et al., 2017; Molendijk et al., 2018). Maternal adherence to this diet pattern during pregnancy has also been associated with protection from allergic disease in human offspring (Netting et al., 2014; Castro-Rodriguez and Garcia-Marcos, 2017). Given the rapid increase in the incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders in children (CDC, 2010; Visser et al.",fef768a0-eaff-440e-9af9-8a0fd55243f1
38,discussion3,", 2013, 2014), if replicated, our results relating maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) during gestation with child neurodevelopmental outcomes may present new avenues for prevention.  Consistent with our findings, laboratory studies suggest that maternal diet during pregnancy may affect offspring behavioral health. Numerous studies in rodents have found associations between maternal diet and offspring neurodevelopment and behavior, such as recent work associating high maternal caloric intake with increased anxiety in male rats . Offspring from female rats fed a high fat diet pre-gestational through lactation suffered cognitive deficits that were ameliorated by dams who also had access to exercise . Anxiety, cognition, and compulsive behaviors were altered in male mice weaned from mothers who had received gut microbiota from high fat diet mice (Bruce-Keller et al., 2017).",a55df3d9-4de0-498a-ac80-27c019580e4a
39,discussion4," Rather than reductions in fat or increases in energy intake, the Mediterranean diet is thought to beneficially influence health outcomes as a result of increases in intakes of micronutrients, including MUFAs, antioxidant vitamins, and phytochemicals . Most rodent research to date has focused on the high-fat paradigm when examining outcomes. Further, nearly all studies examine high-fat in the context of excess energy, further reducing the ability to elucidate whether observed changes in offspring are due to excess body weight, excess energy or fat intake, or some combination.  Imprinted genes have parental allele specific silencing via epigenetics. These patterns are laid down during gametogenesis in imprinting control regions (Bartolomei and Ferguson-Smith, 2011). Germline ICRs are typically more epigenetically stable throughout life and aberrant epigenetic marks for imprinted gene ICRs are associated with effects on metabolism, neurodevelopment, and growth.",af2cd7e7-d178-4eb2-aa60-62a25ef42614
40,discussion5," Because of our findings that maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) is associated with changes in methylation patterns of imprinted genes, changes which can vary by sex, we did re-examine associations of maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) on child behavior stratified by sex despite being underpowered to gain real insight. For a subset of our cohort, we were able to conduct targeted assessment of the CpGs in the control regions of imprinted genes (Supplementary Figure 4), providing evidence for novel associations of maternal diet with changes in methylation in imprinted ICRs of offspring. Our data suggest that high maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) is associated with altered methylation of the MEG3 ICR independent of sex, and of the SGCE/PEG10, PLAGL1 and IGF2 ICRs in a sex-dependent manner.",1a7b98f6-0dfa-4bfc-8b0a-70c0deb93204
41,discussion6," These changes in methylation, are in turn, consistently associated with offspring behaviors that are also associated with maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) (Figure 3).  We report here that maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) is associated with increased methylation of the maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) ICR in males. Several lines of evidence suggest that increased methylation of the MEG3 ICR, regulating a known tumor suppressor , is associated with decreased expression of MEG3, albeit with increased expression of the reciprocally imprinted DLK1 gene . In genome-wide methylation arrays , MEG3 DMR methylation was associated with maternal smoking and in human adults, DLK1 dysregulation has been associated with schizophrenia . In both mice and humans, hypo-methylation of the MEG3 control region has been associated with adverse neurobehavioral phenotypes (Kagami et al.",bd3b1db6-2974-4d8a-8eac-1ec7ce983fc3
42,discussion7,", 2015; Fuemmeler et al., 2016; Drobna et al., 2018). Microarray data from the mouse forebrain have shown differential spatial expression of the imprinted gene Gtl2 (aka Meg3) between the ventral and dorsal telencephalon of the mouse at a critical time point in the generation and migration of cortical neuronal populations . In an effort to boost power, and given the sex independent associations of maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) on the two control regions associated with MEG3, we examined if methylation at these loci mediated our findings of associations of maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) on behavior, but were underpowered to draw conclusions (data not shown).  We also found sex-dependent associations of maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) and the methylation of the epsilon sarcoglycan and paternally expressed gene 10 (SGCE/PEG10) ICR.",338a62e8-7ee2-4252-bd9e-bcfdc3163231
43,discussion8," PEG10 is essential for proper placental development, and over-expression of PEG10 protein has been associated with multiple tumor phenotypes (Okabe et al., 2003; Li X. et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2016), while differential methylation of the SGCE/PEG10 ICR has also been associated with cancer . Hypomethylation of the SGCE/PEG10 ICR has been associated with higher expression of PEG10 as well as maternal stress and depression, although mechanisms are still unclear . In males at age 1 and 3, increased methylation at PEG10 has been associated with greater weight for length ratios (Gonzalez-Nahm et al., 2018), and paternal obesity has been associated with decreased methylation of PEG10 in sperm .  Less is known about Pleiomorphic adenoma-like protein 1 (PLAGL1 or ZAC1). PLAGL1 is a zinc finger protein associated with cell growth suppression and with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus .",4c979171-f9d6-4022-b28e-e70aa0c413bb
44,discussion9," We found maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) associated with hypomethylation of the ICR in males. Interestingly, in the EDEN cohort, maternal alcohol and dietary vitamin B2 were associated with ZAC1 methylation while increased ZAC1 methylation was associated with estimated fetal weight, weight at birth and at 1 year of age .  Lastly, we report a strong association of maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) with hypomethylation of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) in male offspring as well as an association of IGF2 hypomethylation with decreased atypical behavior (Figure 3). Hypomethylation of IGF2 and increased IGF2 protein have been associated with paternal obesity, as well as increased offspring obesity risk (Lawlor et al., 2012; Tobi et al., 2014; Dunford and Sangster, 2017). Decreased methylation of the IGF2 DMR has been associated with increased IGF2 transcripts (Murphy et al., 2012b) and protein .",d0d13f38-d7cb-4bd8-b56d-db0e622a1484
45,discussion10," Differential methylation of IGF2 has been associated with both periconceptual exposure to extreme caloric restriction during the Dutch Famine , and lower circulating folate concentrations . In the ALSPAC cohort, prenatal dietary patterns comprising high fat and high sugar were associated with lower IGF2 methylation and an earlier onset of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) behaviors . Dunford and Sangster provide a more thorough review of parental nutrition and offspring epigenetics in the context of metabolic syndrome risk (Dunford and Sangster, 2017).  Additional studies are needed to replicate these findings, but together, these data support mechanistic relationships between high adherence to Mediterranean diet and shifts in methylation of regulatory sequences of imprinted genes in offspring.",01b4a5f3-c97b-4dca-9622-80405817ac99
46,discussion11,"  We adjusted for a wide array of covariates, including factors such as maternal education, BMI, maternal energy intake, and breastfeeding. Nonetheless, an important limitation of this research is uncertainty of the extent to which associations between child neurodevelopment and maternal diet quality during pregnancy may reflect differences in caregiving which are difficult to measure, or be influenced by confounding by factors such as maternal IQ . Our study was limited to child outcomes in infancy; the persistence of effects in later life, and whether lasting effects may depend on childhood diet, remains uncertain. Though results are promising, more research is needed to elucidate whether this relationship is causal, and to identify the pathways through which maternal adherence to Mediterranean Diet may affect child behavior.  Our study also had some limitations including small sample sizes for stratified analyses.",9b410536-3601-4051-93c7-05deaff0ae7c
47,discussion12," Despite this, all of the overall findings of associations of maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) on offspring behavior and maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) on offspring mean DMR methylation have an false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.15, suggesting these associations warrant further studies to replicate these findings. A lack of dietary data in infants to evaluate the extent to which neurodevelopmental outcomes may have been driven by postnatal dietary exposures other than breastfeeding is a limiting factor of this study, although dietary variability should be somewhat homogeneous at the age of behavioral assessment [12–24 months (mean = 13.9 months)]. Ideally, one would have whole-genome methylation data to identify the strongest associations of diet with CpG methylation. Our study has only focused on the effects at imprinted DMRs; there are likely effects at many other regions throughout the genome that more comprehensive epigenetic analyses would reveal.",a00cc46a-d9d6-4ca2-9dfb-00db9a1fff9d
48,discussion13," Although maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) was associated with half of the imprinted gene regions evaluated, many of these imprinted gene control regions are related to major cell proliferation pathways such as TGF-β and TP53 which would impact vast downstream signaling pathways, so this may be expected. Further, we have not examined any potential effects on other epigenetic regulatory elements, including histone modifications or the expression and actions of non-coding RNAs. Additional epigenome-wide studies are needed to both replicate and clarify these findings and to characterize an epigenomic signature associated with maternal diet. Recall bias in dietary recall questionnaires is often an issue. To minimize recall bias, mothers in our study were asked to fill out a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) about the foods they ate near conception inside of a dozen weeks.",948c1ce1-0ea9-4c1c-b08d-3cac38ed7736
49,discussion14,"  Conclusion We report novel significant associations of maternal periconceptional Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) both with positive neurodevelopmental phenotypes in offspring as well as associations of maternal Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) on differential methylation of CpGs in the control regions of imprinted genes. If confirmed in other studies, these findings may pave the way for early identification of adverse behavior risk in offspring and for tailored interventions.
