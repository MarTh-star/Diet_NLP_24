0,methods0," Seventy-eight breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet) group or control group, and seventy-one were finally analyzed. Body composition, nutrient intake, and metabolic parameters were assessed at baseline and after the 8-week intervention. Fat mass and obesity-associated (Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO)) rs7185735 and melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) rs476828 variants were genotyped.   Study Design and Participants  This 8-week, randomized, controlled dietary trial was performed at Gangnam Severance Hospital in Seoul, South Korea, from September 2019 to September 2020. The study design and experimental protocol were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gangnam Severance Hospital (number 3-2019-0140), and the trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT04045392) in August 2019. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.",c1e490e1-4b92-46a8-8c94-82c797b9c281
1,methods1," All participants provided written informed consent before screening and data collection.  Study participants were recruited via poster and online advertisements at Gangnam Severance Hospital from August 2019 to June 2020. They were also recruited through direct referrals from breast surgeons. Inclusion criteria were as follows: breast cancer patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer stage I–III, who completed cancer treatment (surgery alone or surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy), and who are receiving adjuvant hormone therapy, postmenopausal, overweight or obese [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 23.0 kg/m2, according to the World Health Organization definition (23)].",847efbd1-998e-483c-980e-350e1e078f1b

Randomization  Participants were randomly assigned to the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet) group or control group. Block randomization was performed using a computer-generated random number sequence with a block size of four. An independent statistician generated the allocation sequence, and the study coordinator assigned each participant to the intervention in chronologic order according to the enrollment date.",b21a65f6-b99e-4721-825e-ac3c9e95d0c5
3,methods3," Only outcome assessors were blinded to the group allocation.  Dietary Intervention  Each group was instructed to follow their assigned diet protocol. All participants received dietary advice from research nutritionists at the first (baseline), second (week 4), and last (week 8) visits.  Participants in the MeDiet group received home delivery of two meals daily (breakfast and dinner) on 5 days per week during the 8-week intervention. Participants were advised to follow the Mediterranean diet, even for meals not delivered. The home delivery meals were prepared under the supervision of professional nutritionists by chefs trained on the principles of the Mediterranean diet. Each meal was restricted to 500 kcal, and the composition of nutrients was as follows: 50–55% of calories from carbohydrate, 20–25% of calories from protein, 30–35% of calories from fat, 8–11 g of fiber, and an omega-6:omega-3 ratio of 4–8:1.",233c7ae4-5ee5-4ee8-893b-265880b754f2
4,methods4," The composition of macronutrients was based on the results of the Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT)) (24), as well as the macronutrient ratio with the lowest all-cause mortality identified in our previous study based on Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANS)–linked cause of death data (25). We used a ratio of omega-6:omega-3 of 4–8:1 rather than 4:1 in consideration of Korean dietary habits. In addition, two home delivery meals per day included 15 g of olive oil (3 servings), 1.5 servings of fruit, 4 servings of vegetables, 1 serving of nuts, and 3.5 serving of fish or meat. To assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet, we used the Korean version of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (K-MEDAS), which was developed and validated by our research team (26). However, the item for wine consumption was excluded because of negative evidence linking alcohol consumption with breast cancer.",543a3331-f104-4554-832c-88f79fb9022c
5,methods5," Consequently, K-MEDAS scores used in this study ranged from 0 to 13, with scores above 9 defined as high adherence to the Mediterranean diet.  The control group received only dietary advice based on recommendations of the 2015 Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans (Koreans (KDRI)) (27). We aimed for an energy intake of 1,500 kcal per day with 55–65% of calories from carbohydrate, 7–20% of calories from protein, 15–30% calories from fat, 4–10% from omega-6, ≤ 1% from omega-3, and ≤ 300 mg of cholesterol per day.  Genotyping  DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. All DNA samples were amplified and randomly cleaved into 25–125 bp fragments, which were then purified, resuspended, and hybridized with a Theragen Precision Medicine Research Array (Theragen PMRA), which is a customized array based on the Asian Precision Medicine Research Array (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States).",b14eddd1-f3c8-4edd-af83-4444e1e5d2b7

7,methods7," The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (Supplementary Table 1).  Assessment of Outcomes  Body weight and composition were evaluated at each of the three visits. Body weight (to the nearest 0.1 kg) and height (to the nearest 0.1 cm) were measured using an automatic extensometer (BSM 330; Biospace, Seoul, South Korea) while patients were wearing light-weight clothing and no shoes. BMI was calculated as the ratio of weight (kg) to height squared (m2). Skeletal muscle mass, fat mass, and fat percentages were measured using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer (ACCUNIQ BC720; SELVAS Healthcare Inc., Daejeon, South Korea).  Participants were asked to complete self-reported questionnaires at baseline and after the intervention. The 24-h dietary recall method was used to calculate the total calorie intake and the composition of macro- and micronutrients.",1453eca2-4321-4ec9-a06a-18e73a82aa59
8,methods8," Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated using the aforementioned K-MEDAS, which included 13 items. The quantity of physical activity was calculated in metabolic equivalent-hours per week using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire.  Fasting blood samples were collected from an antecubital vein to assess metabolic parameters at baseline and after the 8-week intervention. White blood cell counts were quantified with an XN-9000 hematology analyzer (Sysmex, IL, United States). Fasting glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were measured with the ADVIA 1650 Clinical Chemistry system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Tarrytown, NY, United States). Fasting insulin was measured by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using an Elecsys 2010 instrument (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, United States).",9999971a-aa18-4d4a-95bc-c25c1edc748f

20,discussion1,"  The Mediterranean diet has been proposed as one of the healthiest dietary patterns worldwide. Although the duration of dietary intervention was short, our results are consistent with those of previous clinical trials demonstrating beneficial effects of the short-term Mediterranean dietary intervention for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk improvement (29, 30). We found that body weight, BMI, fat mass, and fat percentage were significantly decreased in the MeDiet group compared to the control group after adjusting for age and initial BMI (Supplementary Table 4). Among metabolic parameters, only triglycerides significantly decreased in the MeDiet group compared to the control group. The MeDiet group had greater weight loss and metabolic improvement with no significant change in caloric intake (Supplementary Table 5).",03de6ca3-0ccd-4073-af0e-9af297b7eed7
21,discussion2," Several previous studies have also found that calorie-unrestricted Mediterranean diet intervention reduces weight and cardiometabolic risk, supporting the importance of diet quality as well as quantity (29, 31). With its emphasis on plant-based foods, the Mediterranean diet contains a high amount of fiber, low energy density, and low glycemic load, which is a major contributor to its weight-loss effects (32). monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) from olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids from nuts and fish, both of which are important components of the Mediterranean diet, have been shown to reduce serum triglycerides by suppressing the postprandial increase in triglycerides, enhancing triglyceride clearance, and decreasing overall synthesis of triglycerides (33, 34).",8bc9f716-832b-4a44-a5dd-ca5d82608c5a
22,discussion3," Although direct effects of the Mediterranean diet on breast cancer were not examined in this study, improvements in obesity and metabolic parameters are believed to improve the prognosis of patients with early stage breast cancer.  In this study, we also investigated the influence of two representative obesity-associated genes (Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) and MC4R) on body composition, metabolic parameters, and nutrient intake, as well as changes in these factors after intervention within the MeDiet group and control group. At baseline, only total cholesterol and LDL-C were significantly higher in risk allele carriers of the MC4R rs476828 variant, unlike previous studies reporting higher BMI and waist circumferences in risk allele carriers of both Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) and MC4R variants (35, 36).",66b96037-5f51-405c-9696-2a2cb6139372
23,discussion4," This discrepancy may reflect the methodology of the current pilot study, which included a smaller number of participants and only overweight or obese patients, although we did analyze two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s found by our research team to be highly associated with obesity in the Korean population (unpublished data).  According to our results, there were no significant interactions between obesity-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants and dietary intervention for changes in body composition or metabolic parameters, which is consistent with the results of several previous studies (37, 38). By contrast, there were significant interactions between MC4R rs476828 and dietary intervention for changes in both saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake and trans fat intake. Di Renzo et al.",0c08fe7f-441a-4b95-8e59-1fcadc0cdebf
24,discussion5," (39) reported a significant gene-diet interaction only for total body fat mass among body composition parameters and suggested that this finding may reflect the considerable total body fat mass gained by risk allele carriers of the Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) variant in the control group. Ortega-Azorín et al. (21) showed that risk allele carriers of Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) and MC4R variants had a higher risk of type 2 diabetes when adherence to the Mediterranean diet was low; however, these associations disappeared when adherence was high. Similarly, we found that risk allele carriers of MC4R rs476828 had a significantly greater increase in saturated fatty acid (SFA) and trans fat intake (compared with the TT genotype group) after the 8-week intervention only in the control group, whereas no significant differences were found between genotypes in the MeDiet group.",94a67b2b-7f77-4135-b89f-66ddb8ba5559
25,discussion6,"  The precise mechanism whereby only the MC4R variant exhibited significant gene-diet interactions for changes in saturated fatty acid (SFA) and trans fat intake is unclear. Our findings are in line with the results of previous experimental and observational studies demonstrating that MC4R plays a role in controlling fat consumption (40–42). MC4R knockout mice exhibited severe high fat–induced hyperphagia (40), and injection of an MC4R agonist into the amygdala of mice reduced preference for a high-fat diet (41). Furthermore, the prospective cohort study of Qi et al. confirmed a significant association between MC4R rs17782313 and high intake of dietary fat (42). Nevertheless, it is difficult to explain the differences in Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) and MC4R effects observed in our study.  The lack of significant differences between genotypes in the MeDiet group may be attributed to a protective role of the Mediterranean diet.",3bd8208b-a89e-4347-9eae-be47a68dfcfd
26,discussion7," Previous nutrigenomic studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet reduces the expression of genes related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and atherogenesis (43, 44). Furthermore, anti-inflammatory effects of the nutrients and bioactive food components of the Mediterranean diet have been associated with hypermethylation of pro-inflammatory genes (45). Although the direct effects of the Mediterranean diet on Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) and MC4R remain unknown, the Mediterranean diet may modulate the effects of these genes through epigenetic mechanisms since both Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) (46) and MC4R (47) genes are regulated by methylation.  Increased intake of unhealthy fats, such as saturated fatty acid (SFA) and trans fat, another potential risk factor for breast cancer (48), was significant only in risk allele carriers of the MC4R variant in the control group, whereas significance was not observed in the MeDiet group.",e04c5ee1-d01c-4819-904d-88a7a66a131c
27,discussion8," This finding suggests that considering the role of genotypes may be most important when a healthy (Mediterranean) diet is not followed.  Our study had some limitations. First, this pilot study included a relatively small number of participants. Second, the 8-week intervention may not have been long enough to investigate sufficient changes in metabolic parameters, and could not confirm the prognosis or recurrence of breast cancer. This is a preliminary pilot study for the future studies, and further randomized controlled trials with a longer intervention period and larger sample size are required to determine the effects of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s and Mediterranean diet on cardiometabolic risk and breast cancer prognosis. Third, nutrient intake was analyzed using the 24-h dietary recall method, which may have led to recall bias. However, the changes in nutrient intake in the MeDiet group were consistent with the composition of the Mediterranean diet.",14930fd2-cddc-4d88-a0af-d4bd90a73613
28,discussion9," Fourth, body composition was measured using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer instead of more reliable methods, such as dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (49). Nevertheless, bioelectrical impedance analysis is also a validated methodology, with the advantages of low cost and non-invasiveness. Finally, since only one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in each of the Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) and MC4R genes was analyzed, we could not determine the influence of other potential genetic variants in these or other genes. Further studies are required to explore associations between the Mediterranen diet and various other genetic variants including Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) rs9939609, MC4R rs17782313, TMEM18 rs939583, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs16917237.",9491662d-24d8-4b04-a97a-c54fea442acb
29,discussion10,"  The main strength and novelty of our study is that, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to examine the association between two obesity-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s and the Mediterranean diet intervention in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, although this is a pilot study, it is a randomized controlled trial with a control group, and the MeDiet group was provided with home-delivered meals prepared according to Mediterranean diet principles for more precise dietary intervention. Third, we used the validated K-MEDAS questionnaire to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet.  Conclusion  In summary, we found that the Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) rs7185735 and MC4R rs476828 variants did not influence weight loss or improvement of metabolic parameters within the Mediterranean diet intervention in overweight or obese postmenopausal women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant hormone therapy.",1aa19bfb-c2ad-4d1b-a1d4-d9d812a8912d
30,discussion11," Among nutrient intake parameters, only changes in saturated fatty acid (SFA) and trans fat intake were influenced by the MC4R rs476828 variant in the control group and showed a significant gene-diet interaction.
