To reduce the influence of increasing age during follow-up, we also conducted sensitivity analyses by excluding participants whose baseline measures were obtained earlier than 1.5 years before confinement.  In order to identify potential determinants of lifestyle changes or health decline during confinement, we then evaluated the relationship between baseline variables and changes in lifestyles and health outcomes. With this purpose, we used either linear or multinomial regression models that adjusted for baseline socio-demographic factors, housing conditions, smoking status, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, body mass index (BMI), recreational activity and household activity, night-time sleep, chronic morbidities, time since last follow-up visit, cohort of study, and week of confinement.",e88dc6ed-a99f-49aa-9045-df427075571b

At baseline, the mean age was 74.5 years and the proportion of men 42.3%, although this latter figure varied widely across cohorts (from 21.2% in EXERNET to 50.5% in ENRICA 2 (ENRICA)). The prevalence of university studies also differed across cohorts and ranged from >15% in the ENRICA 2 (ENRICA) and ES to 8% in Toledo Study for Healthy Aging (TSHA)A and EXERNET. Similarly, participants in ENRICA 2 (ENRICA) and ES showed a higher prevalence of Internet access. Overall, 65% of participants were married, 4% to 10% lived in houses with no outdoor views, and 24% to 37% lacked an outdoor terrace or balcony to go outside during confinement.",67df895e-991e-4f3e-9116-0601ed165c5d
20,methods20," Regarding social factors, the proportion of participants who lived alone was similar at baseline and during confinement (around 20–25% in all cohorts except for EXERNET, where the frequency was 35%). However, the percentage of participants without daily contact with family or friends halved during the pandemic. Moreover, in ENRICA 2 (ENRICA), the single cohort where this information was available, no increases in lonely feelings during the study period were observed.  3.1. Changes in Tobacco Exposure, Alcohol Intake, Diet Quality, and Weight  Table 1 shows results for changes in the prevalence of smoking, second hand smoke (SHS), alcohol intake, and diet quality between the pre-confinement and confinement periods. While the prevalence of active smoking remained stable, the likelihood of quitting smoking increased during follow-up.",90093f89-50ce-4c9b-8c13-3556acc8cf33
21,methods21," About half of the active smokers at confinement reported no changes in the frequency of tobacco consumption, while 22% reported an increase and 27% a decrease in the frequency of smoking since the start of the pandemic. The risk of increased consumption was higher among smokers with bad sleep quality at baseline and was lower among those lacking a terrace or balcony to smoke (Supplementary Table S2).  In ENRICA 2 (ENRICA), the prevalence of second hand smoke (SHS) increased during follow-up, although this association was lost when excluding participants who had been followed-up for more than 1.5 years. The prevalence of current alcohol drinking was very similar in both periods, whereas a decreased likelihood of daily intake and a non-significant increased probability of daily intake were observed.",4689b17b-68a7-46f8-8a30-c54eb01a8078
22,methods22," Despite this change in the frequency of consumption, data from ENRICA 2 (ENRICA) showed that the prevalence of binge drinking (defined as having >5 units of alcohol in a session in men, or >4 in women) was lower during confinement (1.8%) than before (2.7%) (data not shown in tables). Among drinkers, only a few baseline factors were associated with the odds of changing the frequency of alcohol consumption; notably participants who lacked a terrace or balcony and former smokers showed a lower odds of increasing their frequency of alcohol intake during follow-up (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S2).  The upper graph shows the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of worsening (red color) or improving (blue color) alcohol intake according to the presence of the variables represented on the horizontal axis. Worsening was defined by increasing alcohol frequency from not daily to daily and improving as decreasing alcohol frequency from daily to not daily.",d65fcd58-25da-4e8c-98db-2f3ff7848c7d
23,methods23," For instance, the graph shows that participants who lacked a terrace or balcony and former smokers presented a lower odds of increasing their frequency of alcohol intake (worsening) during follow-up. The lower graph shows the same type of results for adherence to the Mediterranean diet. In this case, worsening and improving were defined by changes in the Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) score in one or more points during follow-up. Variables on the horizontal axis were selected with a backward stepwise regression from the list of candidate variables shown in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.  Most study participants reported eating at a regular time during confinement, and a very low proportion declared eating more ultra-processed food than before (Supplementary Table S1). During confinement, 51.5% of study participants shopped face-to-face, 41.7% asked someone to shop for them, and 6.8% shopped online (data not shown in tables).",8138f344-71fc-43a2-8ed8-1a4cd17c8067
24,methods24," In ENRICA 2 (ENRICA), the odds of snacks consumption and that of use of food to calm anxiety was lower during the State of Alarm than in the pre-confinement period ((odds ratio (OR): 0.72; 95%CI: 0.60; 0.85) and (OR: 0.56; 95%CI: 0.41; 0.76)), respectively (Table 1), although the association with snacks consumption was lost when excluding participants whose follow-up was longer than 1.5 years. Data from all cohorts combined showed a mean reduction of 0.5 points (95%CI: −0.60; −0.45) in the Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) score during follow-up (Table 1). The items that were most negatively affected by the State of Alarm were fruits and vegetables, fish, wine, olive oil, and sofrito (a sauced made of olive oil and garlic); while the preference for olive oil and red meat, consumption of legumes, and consuming fewer sweets and cakes improved.",ee84d9b2-2148-4c02-8ea2-c70974462023
25,methods25," Predictors of increased odds of worsening diet quality with confinement included having better Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) scores at baseline, being older, lacking outdoor views, and sleeping > 9 h/night (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S3). A lower odds of worsening diet quality was observed for daily moderate drinkers and for individuals who performed more physical activity, while those with better general health and non-hypertensives were more likely to experience improvements in the Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS). No differences in changes in the Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) score were observed by grocery modality (data not shown).  Although 29% and 19% of participants reported “feeling they were getting fatter or thinner” with confinement, respectively, no changes in weight between study periods were observed in those with objective information (mean change: −0.57 kgs; 95%CI: −1.29; 0.15).",13d182a2-96f1-4201-bb4c-7cfce4cb1853
26,methods26," Still, self-reported and objective information showed some correlation: on average, those who self-reported “feeling they were getting fatter” had gained 1.3 kg since the pre-confinement measure was taken, while those who self-reported “feeling they were losing weight” had lost, on average, −2.3 kg. Women, those with university studies, short night-time sleepers, and those who took longer naps at baseline experienced greater weight loss during follow-up than their counterparts (Supplementary Table S4).  3.2. Changes in Physical Activity and Sedentary Time  Physical activity and sedentary time were the lifestyle behaviors that changed the most with confinement (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Compared with the pre-confinement period, participants in ENRICA 2 (ENRICA) and EXERNET showed a mean reduction in recreational and household physical activity of 17.48 METs h/week (95%CI: −18.61; −16.35) and 11.32 METs h/week (95%CI: −12.24; −10.",275aa90f-b570-44e5-8b8f-df45b788c3f7
27,methods27,"41), respectively; participants in Toledo Study for Healthy Aging (TSHA) showed a mean reduction in the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score of 16.66 points (95%CI: −19.59; −13.73). Alleged reasons for not doing any physical activity during confinement among those who used to engage in some type of recreational activity before confinement included not being able to go outside (52.4%), not knowing how to perform physical activity at home (11.4%), not having the resources to do physical activity at home (13.3%), or not having enough time (3.4%). Only 3% of study participants increased their physical activity during confinement, and in general this was a slight increase (<4 METs h/week).  Regarding sedentary time, the ENRICA 2 (ENRICA) and EXERNET cohorts showed an average increase of 91.68 min/day (95%CI: 81.21; 102.11), which, according to the ENRICA 2 (ENRICA), was more marked for active (i.e., time on the computer or tablet, time reading) than passive (i.e.",90ec452e-8a6f-41ae-a506-85fd7aec250f
28,methods28,", television viewing) sedentary activities.  Interestingly, changes in physical activity and sedentary time seemed to reverse with time. Compared with those interviewed in the first weeks of total confinement, those interviewed when confinement measures started to be lifted showed a progressive increase in activity and a decrease in sedentary time: average changes per 1 further week of the State of Alarm were 1.45 METs h/week (95%CI: 0.24; 2.66) for recreational activity, −0.30 min/day (−0.44; −0.15) for sedentary time, and 8.83 points (95%CI: 4.31; 13.4) for the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score (Figure 3 and Supplementary Tables S5 and S6).  The upper graph shows the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of decreasing physical activity more than the observed 75th percentile change (red color) or decreasing physical activity less than the observed 25th percentile change (blue color) according to the presence of the variables represented on the horizontal axis.",7f5ee4e2-c94b-4539-8395-9b7e410c62f2
29,methods29," For instance, the graph shows that females and those with greater adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (higher Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) scores) were more likely to decrease physical activity less than the observed 25th percentile change, while those with no daily contact with family or friends or with a lack of outdoor views were more likely to decrease physical activity more than the observed 75th percentile. Similarly, the lower graph shows the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of increasing sedentary time more than the observed 75th percentile change (red color) or increasing sedentary time less than observed 25th percentile change (blue color) according to these variables. Variables on the horizontal axis were selected with a backward stepwise regression from the list of candidate variables shown in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6.  Compared with men, women showed higher odds of presenting healthier changes in activity (OR: 1.34; 95%CI: 1.03; 1.",4e49093a-1445-4fed-87b0-6809de0d2491

In general, sub-optimal housing conditions such as not having outdoor views or lacking a garden/yard were associated with unhealthier changes in physical activity, as well as with higher increases in TV time with confinement, while not having internet access was associated with lower increases in sedentary time, particularly in screen time.",998d0eda-40b2-42eb-bf24-e1a9b6c0ac47
31,methods31," Participants with higher baseline Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) scores were less likely to experience unhealthy changes in physical activity or sedentary time, while those who performed more activity were less likely to increase sitting time, and those who spent more time seated were less likely to reduce physical activity. Poor night-time sleep duration and day-time sleepiness at baseline were also associated with unhealthier changes in activity and sedentary time.  3.3. Changes in Sleep Duration and Sleep Quality  In multivariate models adjusted for changes in other potential confounders, data from all cohorts combined showed no changes in night-time sleep duration with confinement (−0.00 h/night; 95%CI: 0.06; 0.05). However, slight decreases were observed in day-time sleep duration (−12.08 min/day; 95%CI −13.73, −10.42) as well as in the “poor sleep quality” scale (0.12 points; 95%CI: 0.09; 0.15) (Table 1).",770ceb3c-34ab-4009-83a5-30cd21328c4d

In multivariate analyses, participants in ENRICA 2 (ENRICA) showed a mean increase of 4.79 points (95%CI: 4.72; 5.38) in the physical component score (PCS) of the SF-12, a reduction of 1.19 points (95%CI: −1.81; –0.58) in the mental component score (MCS) of the SF-12, and an increase of 0.18 points (95%CI: 0.05–0.30) in the pain scale (Table 1), while the participants in the ES study showed a non-significant 0.18-point decrease (95%CI: −1.85; 1.48) in the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2 0 (WHODAS) score.

Other predictors of unhealthier changes in the physical component score (PCS) were lacking a garden/yard, poorer sleep quality, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, depression, mobility limitations, and lower general life satisfaction. Predictors of unhealthier changes in mental component score (MCS) were living alone, feeling lonelier, having too much noise at home, doing less physical activity, taking very long naps, having mobility limitations, a negative aging experience, and low Mini Mental State Examination Score (MMSE) scores.",49f0b3a2-521d-412e-b778-4df23d224d9f

The relationship with changes in some Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) items (i.e., vegetables, red meat, wine, sweets and cakes) also disappeared, and a slight decrease in night-time sleep was now observed (mean change −0.16 h/day; 95%CI: −0.27; −0.06).  4.",be9bc8e4-e7ba-41d7-890b-e8b437bd9832
36,methods37," Discussion  This study, conducted with older adults from four Spanish population-based cohorts, showed that, on average, strict confinement was not associated with a deterioration in lifestyle risk factors, except for physical activity and sedentary time, whose effects seemed to reverse with the end of the State of Alarm. Despite this, results from the ENRICA 2 (ENRICA) suggested moderate declines in mental health that did not seem to reverse after restrictions were lifted. On the other hand, the apparent improvements in physical health in participants from this last cohort did reverse with the end of the State of Alarm and may have been related to a better self-perceived performance at a less physically demanding time.",8f561c69-30ca-40f4-aada-dbb508e3e7b8
37,methods38,"  This study identified subgroups of individuals at increased risk of developing unhealthier lifestyles with confinement, including males (for physical activity and sedentariness), those without daily contact with family and friends (for diet and physical activity), married participants (for sleep quality), those with feelings of loneliness (for diet and sleep quality), those with sub-optimal housing conditions (for diet, physical activity, TV viewing time), those with unhealthy sleep duration, as well as those with worse overall health or chronic morbidities (i.e., subjects with obesity or diabetics suffered greater reductions in physical activity and greater increases in screen time). On the other hand, having a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and doing more physical activity protected older adults from developing unhealthier lifestyles with confinement.",be36061d-0a32-4c65-9ba4-c1438cf0d054
38,methods39,"  What do other studies say about changes in smoking, alcohol intake, diet quality, and weight during the COVID-19 pandemic?  Different on-line surveys conducted during the first months of the pandemic in adults from China [45], France [46], the Netherlands [47], or the United Kingdom [48] have shown that current smokers were similarly likely (around 20–25%) to increase or decrease their tobacco consumption with the pandemic. In the Dutch survey, authors found that this apparently contradictory relationship was driven both by a negative effect of stress, boredom, and restriction on smoking and by a positive effect of motivation to quit smoking from fear of contracting COVID-19 and becoming severely ill. Consistently, in a Chinese survey, participants with higher epidemiologic concern were more often willing to improve their diets [49]. In the UK study, on the other hand, symptoms of mental distress (i.e.",fb746b67-3afe-453c-8684-56192c8ed9d4
39,methods40,", anxiety, low mood, sleeping problems) during quarantine were more frequently associated with increasing than decreasing tobacco smoke. Although in secondary analysis we did not find a relationship between symptoms of psychological distress and depression (measured at follow-up with the General Health Questionnaire-12 [50] and the Geriatric Depression Scale [51]) and changes in smoking frequency, we did observe that smoking older adults who spent more time listening or reading news related to the COVID-19 outbreak were more likely to increase their tobacco consumption (data not shown in tables). Our study provides evidence that smokers with poor sleep quality may be at higher risk of increasing smoking frequency in stressful situations than those who have good sleep quality.",a77d5698-0cd3-4bb7-8dd6-b1c44dd78a53
40,methods41," It also shows that while “lacking a terrace or balcony” was positively associated with unhealthier changes in physical activity and sedentary time with confinement, it reduced the risk of smokers and drinkers to increase their frequency of tobacco and alcohol intake, respectively.  In our study, the proportion of alcohol drinkers who increased and that of those who decreased alcohol intake with lockdown was very similar, around 15%. Compared with other surveys, the frequency of increased alcohol consumption was much lower in our population than in adults in Germany (34.7%) [52], Australia (20.0% [53] to 30.8% [54]), or the USA (29%) [55] and was more similar to that reported in other Spanish [14,22], French [46,56], and Italian surveys [57]. In fact, in these studies, declining alcohol consumption during quarantine was more common than increasing it.",d7fb3f64-e47c-4033-9c95-c6d50b8dec76
41,methods42," Although some of the observed differences across countries may be accounted for by discrepancies in study designs (pre-post comparisons vs online surveys) and age of participants, they may also be influenced by the more social nature of drinking in Southern European countries than in other cultures. In any case, to our knowledge, ours are the first results that are entirely based on an elderly population.  Results for changes in diet quality are difficult to compare because of differences in diet assessment across studies, with some showing the proportion of those who increased or decreased the consumption of certain products [11,15,57,58], others asking participants to report their self-perceived changes in quality [56,59], and only a few studies providing validated diet quality scores [17,18,60]. Even for the latter, comparisons are limited due to the use of different scales; for instance, in a Spanish study, confinement was associated with a mean increase of 0.",e83f650e-51a5-437b-b79b-91fdd071436f
42,methods43,"8 points in the Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) score [17], in one French study it was associated with a mean reduction of 0.32 points in the simplified PNNS-GS2 index [18], while in another study it was associated with equivalent increases or decreases in the Alternative Healthy Eating Index [60]. Other factors compounding this comparison are the retrospective collection of pre-confinement information and the lack of focus on older adults.  Our results were somewhat expected because, during the State of Alarm, both older adults (the segment of the population that is more used to daily shopping for foodstuffs in Spain [61]) and the whole the population inevitably had to decrease the frequency of shopping for foods that are typically consumed fresh (i.e., fruits, vegetables, or fish). In line with our results, two Spanish surveys indicated a reduction in the consumption of these fresh foods in younger adults during confinement [17,22].",112af19a-2211-4b51-b10f-a0743304869d
43,methods44," Despite this, we observed some compensations in diet quality in older adults thanks to a decrease in the intake of foods not typical in the Mediterranean diet (i.e., red meat, sweets and cakes), or an increase in the consumption of legumes, which are typically prepared at home.  Previous surveys described mental health during confinement as an important predictor of reductions in diet quality, a fact confirmed in our study, where those with higher follow-up GDS-10 scores showed a higher risk of diet quality decline (relative risk ratio (risk of diet quality decline (relative risk ratio (RRR)) per 1 point increase in the GDS-10: 1.25; 95%CI: 1.13–1.39). We also identified a number of baseline predictors of diet decline with confinement: social isolation (which may reflect not having someone to buy fresh foods for them), a lack of outdoor views (which is associated with lower income), the insufficiency of physical activity, or suffering with poor general health or hypertension.",1184c040-f08c-474a-a8be-7aa2f25cc9b8
44,methods45,"  Changes in weight occurring in short periods of time may be important if, as the literature on obesity suggests, they remain over time [62]. Fortunately, though, most surveys either showed no or small changes in weight with confinement [14,15,16]. In our study, despite mean declines in diet quality and physical activity, only specific subgroups of older adults (mainly hypertensives and those with a negative aging experience) presented significant weight gains. Moreover, we observed that women, those with university studies, and those with short sleep and very long naps presented significant weight loss. The fact that weight loss was not associated with either baseline or follow-up (secondary analysis) overall health, psychological distress, or depression symptoms reduces the probability that it was involuntary, and thus indicative of an increased risk of frailty [63]. In any case, underlying changes in body composition (i.e.",cf688fe6-c60d-4e97-9489-e82629be1756
45,methods46,", reduction in muscle mass and increase in fat mass) associated with the COVID-19 lockdown deserve further study in the older population.  What do other studies say about changes in physical activity and sedentary time during the COVID-19 pandemic?  Surveys on non-institutionalized adults have shown declines in physical activity and increases in sedentary time with confinement, which varied according to varying degrees and lengths of lockdown [11,19,20,64,65,66], with unhealthier changes generally observed among those with higher activity and lower sedentariness at baseline [19,64,66] and among those who had follow-up symptoms of loneliness and worse mental health [12,19,64,66]. In our study, we corroborated the association between previous levels of activity and sedentariness and changes in these behaviors with confinement, probably reflecting the regression to the mean phenomenon.",e9946f3e-3b6a-42b1-b6d7-0fded60f570b
46,methods47," Additionally, we first identified subpopulations of older adults who may be at increased risk of decreasing PA or increasing ST during quarantine. This information can help prioritize subgroups for health promotion or for being allowed to go outside, should future home confinements take place (i.e., the oldest old, those with worse housing conditions, or individuals with diabetes).  What do other studies say about changes in sleep duration and sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic?  Worse sleep quality with confinement has been reported among the adult general population in different countries [11,12,13,66], and it is partly attributed to inactivity [12] and higher anxiety and mental distress during isolation [21]. In our study, the association with mental health during quarantine was confirmed, with an increased risk of reducing sleep quality in individuals with higher GDS-10 scores (risk of diet quality decline (relative risk ratio (RRR): 1.25; 95%CI: 1.13–1.",c5f24508-640c-4aa1-9e37-e31114d90bfd
47,methods48,"39; data not shown in tables). Moreover, our study identified for the first time predictors of these changes, showing that older women who live alone and feel lonely, those with worse diet quality, as well as those with worse overall health and higher pain are at increased risk of developing sleep problems with confinement.  What do other studies say about changes in overall health and pain during the COVID-19 pandemic?  A quantity of evidence supports a link between confinement and decline in mental health, both in middle-aged and older adults, and provides evidence that female gender [9] and being younger [67] are risk factors of these declines. However, we have only found one study evaluating the effect of confinement on chronic pain, which showed a mild improvement of migraine features during quarantine [68].",048bdf04-a99f-46ee-aeca-1792727fe8ac
48,methods49," Now we have identified subgroups of older adults who are more vulnerable to mental health decline with confinement, including those who feel lonelier, perform less physical activity, have mobility limitations, low Mini Mental State Examination Score (MMSE) scores, or a negative aging experience. In addition, we found that individuals who lacked a garden/yard or who had poor sleep quality, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, depression, or mobility limitations were at increased risk of deteriorating physical function during confinement. Finally, we observed that women with short sleep, worse overall health, and lower overall life satisfaction, osteo-muscular disease, and depression, as well as those who suffered from mobility limitations were at increased risk of pain worsening.",f8451496-ba83-4bc8-b807-931df7bf279c
49,methods50,"  Study Limitations and Strengths  Among the limitations of the present study are that not all cohorts had information in all of the studied variables and that there was a lack of data on the longer-term (July–December) effects of isolation measures. Moreover, the study cohort did not include institutionalized older adults, so results may not be generalizable to them. However, ours is one of the very few studies that have evaluated the effects of the pandemic in non-COVID-19-infected community dwelling older adults. Moreover, unlike most of the reviewed web-based surveys, it relied on telephone interviews and used pre-pandemic in-home collected information on participants’ health behaviors and health status, reducing the risk of information bias (i.e., people not accurately reporting their past exposures or symptoms).  5.",4921287e-2f6c-4f4c-998a-1b53ed83feaa
50,methods51," Conclusions  The lockdown during the first wave of COVID-19 in Spain, which was one of the most restrictive in Europe, was not associated with a deterioration in lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol intake, diet, or weight), except for decreased physical activity and increased sedentary time, which reversed with the end of confinement. However, mental health was affected, particularly in those living alone, feeling lonelier, with mobility limitations, and with lower cognitive function. If another lockdown is imposed in this or in future pandemics, public health programs should specially address the needs of older individuals of male sex, with greater social isolation, sub-optimal housing conditions, and chronic morbidities because of their greater vulnerability to the enacted movement restrictions.
