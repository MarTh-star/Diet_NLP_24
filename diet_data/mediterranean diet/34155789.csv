0,methods0," Population and study design  All primary and secondary schools in the Valle de Ricote (Region of Murcia, Spain) were asked to take part in this research. Similarly, participants from 22 secondary schools from the province of Cáceres (Extremadura, Spain) were enrolled. For this study, participants were recruited by a convenience sample. A final sample of 2890 Spanish schoolchildren (46% girls) aged 6–17 years were included. Of the total number of participants, 1318 (46%) were from Murcia and 1572 (54%) from Extremadura. Information about the selection of the study sample is shown in Fig. S1. Likewise, the characteristics and differences according to the participants’ exclusion/inclusion are shown in Table S1. Children, adolescents, their families, and school staff were previously informed about the study’s procedures. To be included in this study, an informed consent form signed by parents or legal guardians was required.",9aed4d23-93e3-4590-9002-917813433396
1,methods1," Regarding inclusion criteria, we only included schoolchildren aged 6–17 years with informed consent signed by parents or legal guardians. In relation to exclusion criteria, schoolchildren did not enroll when they (a) did not participate in Physical Education lessons, since questionnaires and tests were performed during this subject; (b) had some kind of dysfunction that reduced the participation in PA (i.e., motor problem, any disease); and (c) were under some drug therapy.  The Ethics Committee of the University of Extremadura (ID Nº. 89/2016) and the Bioethics Committee of the University of Murcia (ID Nº. 2218/2018) approved the study protocols, and it was conducted in line with the Declaration of Helsinki and with full respect for human rights.  Procedures  Breakfast status  To determine the habit of breakfast, a dichotomous item about breakfast status (yes/no) was used from the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index for children and teenagers (KIDMED) [26].",f5109ec9-2297-45c5-9678-17edafcef66c
2,methods2," According to this question, children’s and adolescents’ breakfast was classified as breakfast or skipping breakfast. The questionnaires were administered and managed by trained staff.  Anthropometric measures  To measure the body height of participants, a portable height rod (precision: 0.1 cm) was used. Bodyweight was determined by an electronic scale (precision: 0.1 kg). Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was computed by dividing body weight (in kg) by body height (in meters squared), and, then, Body mass index (BMI) was converted into z-scores and, therefore, excess weight status (i.e., overweight and/or obesity) was established according to World Health Organization criteria for sex and age [27, 28]. All measurements were performed by the same researcher in the Region of Murcia and another in Extremadura, respectively.",8699f251-c6d6-425d-8c1a-a54751044db8
3,methods3,"  Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity  Participants fulfilled the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ)-A) or the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ)-C) to provide an estimation of the time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during the last seven days [29, 30]. These tools have been previously translated and validated into Spanish and include nine items scored on a [31, 32].  Respecting individuals aged 6–7 years, former recommendations about the fulfillment of Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ)-C were adopted [33], as this tool was validated for youths from 8 to 14 years old. Thus, these recommendations indicate that parents can help their children to fulfill the questionnaire, without offering any guidelines for responding.  Furthermore, the mean of daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was computed following Saint-Maurice et al.",93e19248-e9ca-4586-b70c-05167b8e254e
4,methods4,"’s equation [34] and used for further analysis.  Covariates  Participants’ sex and age were self-reported. The annual household income was considered as a proxy of the level of socioeconomic status (socioeconomic status (SES)). Data on this matter was acquired by the Extremadura Statistics Institute and the Regional Statistics Center of Murcia, which categorize the socioeconomic status in relation to the annual household income in each of the municipalities of the Extremadura and the Region of Murcia, respectively. The choice of these covariates was based on the scientific literature [13, 14]. ",5a8285d2-5bb9-45ca-81fe-3e6162ee91d1
5,analysis0," The participants’ characteristics of the analyzed sample were shown as frequency distribution for categorical variables and as mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables. The assumption of normality was checked by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Differences between sexes were verified by Student’s t test. Binary logistic regression analyses, adjusted by potential covariates (age, region, and socioeconomic status (SES)), were computed to verify the associations between daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), breakfast status, and excess weight status. Moderation analyses were conducted using PROCESS macro 4.0 in IBM SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0, Armonk, NY, USA).",6977683d-570b-42bc-a257-e5039de85e0a
6,analysis1," The PROCESS macro applies ordinary least squares (ordinary least squares (OLS)) analysis to estimate moderation models (model 1 in PROCESS) using Body mass index (BMI) z-score/excess weight status as dependent variables, breakfast status as the independent variable, and daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as the moderator variable, with a bootstrapping-resampling procedure (10,000 samples) [35]. Simple linear regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship of the daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with breakfast status and Body mass index (BMI) z-score. Furthermore, the pick-a-point approach was performed as a method for probing moderation, including arbitrary values (i.e., mean and ± 1 SD) for daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). These values were categorized into low (− 1 SD), medium (mean), and high (+ 1 SD). For simple linear regression analyses, we used the following parameters: effect size (f [2]) = 0.",4fa0c519-af00-44e7-aa72-e82edf001b75

Therefore, the minimum number of participants was 652. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of the daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with breakfast status and excess weight status. For logistic regression analyses, we used the following formula n > 10 (k + 1) [36], where k is the number of independent variables. Therefore, as we had five independent variables, the minimum sample of participants required was 600. ",471a4442-adb7-4b02-8a62-69847ce52d30

11,discussion0," The present study suggested that the relationship between skipping breakfast and excess weight was moderated by daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in two Spanish regions. Although the number of breakfast skippers was higher among girls and the number of participants with excess weight was greater in boys, the moderator role of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in the association between skipping breakfast and both Body mass index (BMI) (z-score) and excess weight was consistent in both sexes. One possible reason is that girls who eat breakfast in a daily basis have shown a higher quality breakfast than boys [37]. Supporting this idea, different breakfast habits among European boys (i.e., higher intake of breakfast cereals, fruit, milk, and dairy, and fewer sugar-sweetened beverages) and girls (i.e., lower intake of pasta, rice, and others) have been inversely related to excess weight [38].",e495f4af-89c0-4747-bfef-31a62e60fa29
12,discussion1," Despite its cross-sectional design, our results indicate that promotion of a healthy eating habit such as having breakfast should be accompanied by increases in daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), as young participants who have breakfast and with higher daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) seem to be more likely to have no excess weight [38].  In accordance with the present results, previous studies have indicated that skipping breakfast is linked with obesity [5, 9, 10]. There are several factors which could justify this finding. First, breakfast skipping is related to changes in decreased satiety and higher appetite, which may result into overeating and altered insulin sensitivity [39]. Second, having breakfast is helpful for controlling appetite, and it can also enhance blood glucose levels and increase insulin sensitivity in the following meals [39].",1a616a3b-b948-4c7d-948c-af9921f1b67c
13,discussion2," Third, skipping breakfast can extend the overnight fast and more fasting time may result into increased release of ghrelin (a peptide hormone that promotes hunger) [40]. Fourth, children who skipped breakfast could have a low overall diet quality [41], which could lead to excess weight [21]. Fifth, cultural differences related to meal timing among countries could influence on excess weight [42]. For instance, Spain is located relatively westward within its time zone, resulting in sun rise and sun set occurring at a later time as compared to many other countries within the same time zone. The late meal timing in Spain is thus less extreme in comparison with solar time and it has been related to greater Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in Spanish schoolchildren [43]. Notwithstanding the above, the mechanisms linking skipping breakfast and excess weight are still unclear [13].",d123e055-6c9e-4f14-8633-46eb606fa283
14,discussion3,"  Another important finding was that daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and excess weight were inversely associated. This fact is consistent with the scientific literature [44, 45]. Thus, higher levels of PA (including non-exercise activity thermogenesis) have been linked to lower Body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage, as well as for those who have excess weight, increased PA levels can be effective for reducing Body mass index (BMI) [44, 45] and body fat percentage [45]. More specifically, moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) has proven to be especially relevant in the prevention and treatment of childhood and adolescent obesity [44]. Notwithstanding, PA levels are mainly low among young people with obesity [46]. Moreover, a meta-analysis by Wang et al. [47] found that only the 31% of single PA had significant and favorable results to prevent childhood obesity.",741049bc-db33-4717-8301-0edd6cf032c6
15,discussion4," However, it is important to take into account that a significant body of research indicates that small changes in nutrition in addition to PA are also necessary to control weight [21].  Findings also seem to indicate that a sufficient amount of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) could moderated the association between skipping breakfast and excess weight in both sexes. Some studies have shown that moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was not a mediator variable in this relation neither in girls nor boys (adolescents), as well as in Latin and African American girls with excess weight [23, 24]. Conversely, Albertson et al. [48] revealed in a longitudinal study that PA is a mediator in relationship between eating breakfast and Body mass index (BMI) over time in White and Black adolescent girls.",29dd55b3-03de-4deb-8309-6b12ce1cd9bd
16,discussion5," Based on our findings, it seems that although young people who skip breakfast show higher risk of suffering obesity [9], greater levels of PA might be a valuable contributor to energy balance and weight control [45]. There are some mechanisms which could explain the associations obtained. As was previously mentioned, breakfast skipping is related to variations in decreased satiety and appetite, which may result into overeating and altered insulin sensitivity [39]. It might be explained by the reason that a higher PA level may lead to an increase in total calories consumed. Nevertheless, individuals with greater PA levels may be more sensitive to appetite control system by improved compensatory regulations for the density and energy content of food [49]. Supporting this idea, Schubert et al.",58f1ea76-35e1-4bf3-92b2-0e4977bf17f7
17,discussion6," [50] in their meta-analysis showed that exercise is successful to induce a caloric deficit (in a short term) and that people do not tend to compensate for the energy expenditure during physical exercise in the following hours post exercise by modifying food consumption. Additionally, another meta-analysis has shown that acute exercise might affect appetite by suppressing levels of some hormones (e.g., ghrelin), which could facilitate alterations in food/beverage consumption post-acute exercise. Also, a systematic review with meta-analysis conducted by García-Hermoso et al. [51] pointed out the efficacy of interventions including aerobic exercise on insulin resistance indicators in youths with obesity.",f39d38e9-d25b-4012-9c23-47c2194aa8ac
18,discussion7," In relation to the previously mentioned Spanish’s late meal timing, one study showed that a large dinner or late-evening snacking is associated with higher Body mass index (BMI) only in children with low PA levels, suggesting that increased PA levels seem to compensate for the negative effects of late-night excessive caloric intake on children’s Body mass index (BMI) [52]. Similarly, another study found that children at the lowest quartile of PA level had a positive association between the calories consumed at dinner and Body mass index (BMI), being this association inverse for children at the highest quartile of PA level [52]. These same authors found that high-energy intake at dinner and evening snack was related to skipping breakfast in children. However, the dinner consumption was not assessed in this study.",5d3570c3-e08e-4353-9095-d0096081ae7b
19,discussion8," Based on these facts, it is hypothesized that moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) could moderate the association of skipping breakfast on excess weight in both boys and girls.  Breakfast is one of the more debated meals, contemplated as the most essential of the day on some occasions [6] and questioned in others [53]. For instance, a recent systematic review with meta-analysis concludes that breakfast consumption should be promoted to increase the macronutrient quality and food intake in both children and adolescents [54]. Conversely, one systematic review and meta-analysis including randomized controlled trials by Sievert et al. [55] (in adults) pointed out that caution is required to recommend breakfast for reducing body weight, since it may have the contrary result, regardless of established breakfast habit. Breakfast may not or may be the most essential meal, but it is undoubtedly a meal that needs further research [56].",9b84888b-b0eb-46e1-8a09-ee094ba09570
20,discussion9," What our results do suggest to point to is that if breakfast is skipped, high levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) could reduce the association of skipping breakfast on excess weight in young people.  One strength of the current study is that, to date, the moderator role of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) level in the relation between skipping breakfast and excess weight in young people has not been extensively studied. Thus, our study evaluated this association in a large sample of Spanish young people. Conversely, our research also had certain limitations. A causal relationship was not developed due to the cross-sectional nature of this study. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (with or without skipping breakfast) promotes having excess weight or, contrariwise, that skipping breakfast causes decrease in the moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) level (i.e.",f6ee77ef-1be8-445c-a9c9-5cf3a8b8e992
21,discussion10,", the reverse causality). Hence, despite the reason that a specific dependence direction between variables was discussed, several directions of these associations are also possible. In addition, the estimation of PA level would be more accurate with the use of accelerometers instead of questionnaires. However, Saint-Maurice et al.’s Equation [34] has shown a high correlation with accelerometry values (r = 0.63) and there were no statistically significant differences between the recorded and estimated moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). One difficulty found to analyze the evidence of the association between eating breakfast and health is the description of what a healthy breakfast includes, in relation to the type of food that it is composed of, the frequency of its consumption, or the energy content, aspects which were not analyzed in the present study [57].",cc871ac0-c717-4311-8f89-c8977dff0184
22,discussion11," Also, it has been pointed out that energy density (in breakfast) should be considered as a further element of breakfast intake [58], since it could be associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in young people with excess weight. Finally, fatness by a 4-compartment model, which is considered the gold standard for assessing body composition, was not measured. However, it is high-priced and involves specific tools to independently determine the body water, total bone mineral content, and body volume [59]. For all of these abovementioned reasons, caution is required to interpret our results.  In conclusion, our results showed that daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) moderates the association between skipping breakfast and excess weight, meaning that PA of sufficient intensity seems to reduce the effect of skipping breakfast on young body weight status.",7badfd57-cdb1-4bcd-870b-a2b2b3a158ac
23,discussion12," This finding may be important for the establishment of public health policies that will help to the prevention of childhood obesity. Therefore, interventions planned to promote the sufficient practice of PA among children and adolescents could be crucial for maintaining a more appropriate weight status, especially in those who are skipping breakfast.
