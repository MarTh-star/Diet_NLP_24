0,methods0,"From December 2013 to May 2014, individuals between 18 and 65 years of age, who attended the outpatient HIV Clinic at the University Hospital Santa Maria, Lisbon, were selected. Adherence to Mediterranean diet was evaluated with MedDietScore, a scale from 0 to 55 that punctuates 11 food items according to the frequency of intake. Higher scores represent higher adherence. cardiovascular risk (CVR) was assessed using D.A.D tool (classified as low, moderate or high risk). We excluded individuals with opportunistic disease, hospitalized in the past three months or with renal disease diagnosis. All participants gave written informed consent.

1,results1," No relation between MS and Mediterranean diet was found. Higher cardiovascular risk (CVR) was associated with the presence of MS in the antiretroviral treatment (ART) group (p=0.001). In this group, individuals with moderate cardiovascular risk (CVR) presented higher rates of adherence to Mediterranean diet (p=0.036) when compared to low and high cardiovascular risk (CVR) score.  Conclusions In this cross-sectional study, na√Øve individuals presented a trend to higher adherence to Mediterranean diet. On the antiretroviral treatment (ART) group, higher adherence to Mediterranean diet was found in individuals with moderate cardiovascular risk (CVR) score. We think that this might suggest that this group of patients adopt this diet only in the presence of metabolic alterations or perceived cardiovascular risk (CVR). Prospective studies in HIV patients are required to determine the impact of adherence to Mediterranean diet on the reduction of cardiovascular risk (CVR).  ",33990ef9-968d-4ca5-8d8a-5b993b0f064b
