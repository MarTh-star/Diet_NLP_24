0,background0," Several studies have investigated the relationship between dietary patterns and the risk of bladder cancer (BC) in different regions including Europe, the United States, and Asia, with no conclusive evidence. A meta-analysis was undertaken to integrate the most recent information on the relationship between a data-driven Western diet (WD), the Mediterranean diet (MD), and dietary-inflammatory-index (dietary inflammatory index (DII)) and the risk of BC.  Method  We looked for published research into the relationship between dietary patterns and the incidence of BC in the PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up until February 2021. Using a multivariate random-effects model, we compared the highest and lowest categories of WD, MD and dietary inflammatory index (DII) patterns and provided the relative risk (RR) or odds ratios (OR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs) for the relevant relationships.

1,methods0," This study was carried out in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses (PRISMA)) standard recommendations [27].  Protocol and registration  The aim of this study was to see if there was an association between dietary habits and the risk of developing BC. In August 2020, the study protocol was registered with the CRD42020155353 registration number in the international prospective register of systematic reviews database (PROSPERO) (Available at: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=155353).  Search strategy and selection criteria  Without restrictions, we searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science (ISI), Cochrane library, Clinicaltrials.gov, and SCOPUS databases for papers that indicated a relation between dietary patterns and the risk of BC up to February 2021.",ff7c720b-d4ac-41cd-ac87-0e9a7d14d747

Additionally, the reference lists of the included papers and recent major reviews were carefully evaluated to find other relevant publications in order to prevent missing any related article. Review studies, and if the retrieved publications didn’t fulfilled the following inclusion criteria, they were excluded in our study: studies with a case–control or cohort design, reported the associations between dietary patterns and BC, included newly diagnosed cases of BC, diagnosed all cases using pathological biopsies or other standard methods, and provided relative risks (RRs), hazards ratios (HRs), or odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals for the dietary patterns.",b0b5ab98-73ee-4b96-93ba-ef206ff30e50
3,methods2," We included the most often identified dietary patterns across studies to reduce the possibility of misclassifications, and we made sure that the selected dietary patterns were specified consistently in terms of factor loadings of the most frequently consumed foods as much as feasible. The categorization of Western, Mediterranean and dietary inflammatory index (DII) dietary patterns was based on selected peer-reviewed publications. When several publications from the same data were found, the publication with the most participants/person-years was chosen. The selected articles and reading the titles and abstracts of the searched papers independently were examined by two independent reviewers (NA and DB). If both reviewers agreed that a publication did not fulfill the above-mentioned inclusion criteria, it was excluded. Inconsistencies (if any) were to be solved by a consultation with a third author (MD).",ad34f421-d58b-4270-b285-6d6b6e96cc1c
4,methods3,"  Data extraction and quality assessment  Using a standardized data collection form, two reviewers independently extracted the required information. From each study, we gathered the following data: first author's last name; year of publication; study location; study design; sample size; duration of follow-up; method of analysis; diagnostic criteria; gender; average age of participants; dietary valuation methods; dietary patterns; RRs, HRs, or ORs and the corresponding 95% CIs for the highest vs. the lowest categories; of dietary patterns from the final adjusted models and potential confounders adjusted in the multivariate analysis. The authors were contacted by email at least twice, one week apart, when the full text of a paper was unavailable or if any essential information was missing in the provided data. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS)) was used to measure quality assessment of the included studies [28].",302c505d-12c5-4ea1-bd96-ec27ca8998e7
5,methods4," Concisely, we used a nine-score tool based on the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess the quality of the studies characterized by three broad criteria: [1] appropriate study population selection, [2] study group comparability, and [3] ascertainment of the exposure (for cohort studies) or outcome (for case control studies) of interest. Each study's quality was independently assessed by two reviewers (NA and DB). Disagreements were once again resolved by discussion among the reviewers. Studies having a score of 7 or above, with 9 being the maximum, were deemed to be of high quality.  Statistical analyses  The observed relationship between dietary patterns and the risk of BC was measured using RRs as the common scale. As RR estimators, HRs, ORs, and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were also utilized [29]. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis to obtain the pooled RR and its 95% confidence intervals.",09b5f461-d604-4a33-82fb-45f883e1b7cb
6,methods5,"  Because of the potential heterogeneity in clinical and methodological characteristics within and between studies, the random-effects analysis was used [30].  To assess heterogeneity across studies, we utilized Q statistics with a significance level of P < 0.10. We also used the I2 statistic to indicate the variance between studies that may be attributed to heterogeneity rather than chance. Moderate heterogeneity was defined as an I2 value larger than 50% [31].  To measure the impact of individual or a group of studies on the results e conducted a sensitivity analysis. We tested for publication bias by visual inspection of Begg’s funnel plots presenting log RRs against their standard errors (SEs) [32, 33]. STATA version 15.0 was used for all analyses (Stata Corp LP, College Station, Texas). Except otherwise specified, statistical significance was defined as a P-value of less than 0.05.

We observed a direct association between WD and risk of BC, and an inverse association between MD and risk of developing BC. However, there was no association between dietary inflammatory index (DII) and BC risk.  Several systematic review and meta-analyses have investigated the association between dietary patterns and the risk of cancer of other organs, WD was associated with increased risk of colorectal [37, 38], stomach [39], and prostate cancers [40]. Similar to our results, a meta-analysis with 12 observational studies reported that WD is related to an increased risk of prostate cancer but no association between healthy pattern and prostate cancer risk [40]. However, to date no meta-analysis is available on the association between dietary patterns and BC.",5018ad69-2a5e-4b38-ab2e-34347daef579
22,discussion1," The results published from studies that have examined the relationship between WD and risk of BC are in accordance with our findings [9–11]. For example, the results of a recently published pooled analysis on 13 cohorts suggested that adherence to a WD pattern is associated with an increased risk of BC [10]. Also, Westhoff et. al. found that greater adherence to a WD was associated with a higher risk of BC recurrence [11]. This finding supports the hypothesis that WD plays a role in the etiology and prognosis of BC. According to the results, although a strong association was observed between higher adherence to a WD and BC in cohort studies (RR 1.55, 95%CI: 1.37 to 1.70), we found no significant association between WD and risk of BC in case–control studies (RR 1.30, 95%CI: 0.81 to 1.88). This might be due to recall bias in these studies and even small sample size of the included case control studies.",d683a172-56f6-4441-b1d3-a6f213590d09
23,discussion2,"  Epidemiological studies have concentrated on some key elements of WD and reported a positive associations between red and processed meat, refined grain and saturated fats and risk of BC [41]. Red and processed meat is one of the important key elements of this dietary pattern and it is positively associated with the risk of BC [42]. Potentially hazardous materials present in the WD, such as N-nitroso-compounds, heterocyclic aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in red meat, are excreted in the urine. As a result, they come into direct contact with the inner lining of the bladder wall, potentially causing cancer in urothelial cells [43]. Moreover, it is suggested that red and processed meats contain saturated fat and heme iron, potential inducers of oxidative stress and DNA damage [44]. Also, more mutagenic substitutes during the cooking procedure of these nutrients takes place. As mentioned by Matteo et. al.",59fa21b9-27f0-4f68-9489-6cd52701b560
24,discussion3,", cooking meat or fats, main components of WD, at higher temperatures (roasting) or for prolonged times (e.g., stewing) were associated with an increased BC risk [45]. According to the previous studies, components produced during food processing, particularly when meat is cooked at higher temperatures or for longer periods of time, can damage DNA and increase the risk of cancer [45–47]. However, the lack of information on cooking and preparing food in the included studies prevented us to conduct a subgroup analysis according to the cooking methods.  Regarding adherence to MD and cancer risk, results of a systematic review reported that MD was inversely associated with cancer mortality and risk of colorectal, breast, gastric, liver, head and neck, gallbladder, and biliary tract cancers [48]. However, a meta-analysis of 10 epidemiological studies provided evidence that MD is not related with prostate cancer risk [49].",ba9e6341-688e-44a0-b5ae-b35ff906bee2
25,discussion4," In our meta-analysis the association between MD and risk of BC was reported by 6 studies [12–17]. We found a stronger association between MD and BC in cohort studies rather than case–control studies. A pooled analysis of 13 cohort studies showed that adherence to the MD was associated with a reduced risk of developing BC (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.93), suggesting a positive effect of a MD on BC risk [16]. In addition, Dugué et al. discovered a moderate inverse relationship between MD adherence and urothelial cell cancer [17]. Also, Buckland et al. found an inverse associations between adherence to the MD and occurrence of overall, aggressive or non-aggressive, BC for both gender [14]. It is suggested that, among key elements of this diet, some of them had beneficial effects on the prevention of BC. For example, it has been shown that the consumption of vegetables and fruits, as the main components of the WD, are inversely associated with the risk of BC [50, 51].",544ffb0d-8b00-4521-800c-953b8d1ae9a3
26,discussion5," It is suggested that, polyphenols, carotenoids, and vitamins C and E are abundant in both vegetables and fruits, and they serve as antioxidants, preventing DNA damage by neutralizing reactive oxygen species [52]. Olive oil is another significant component of the MD that has been examined as a single dietary item in relation to bladder cancer. Brinkman et al. showed that a higher consumption of olive oil was inversely related to the risk of BC [13].  Regarding dietary inflammatory index (DII), A meta-analysis found that higher pro-inflammatory diets are linked to an increased risk of prostate, kidney, and bladder cancer [53], results that are different with our finding. In this study, we investigated 2 case–control and 2 cohort studies [17, 34–36] on the association of dietary inflammatory index (DII) and BC. Our pooled estimates show that dietary inflammatory index (DII) was not significantly associated with the BC risk.",fc981d45-e403-467c-a214-196dd81e4bd7
27,discussion6," Null association between a dietary inflammatory index (DII) and BC in cohort studies suggests that the significant association found in case–control studies may be due to recall bias rather than a real association. The discrepancies between the individual studies could be attributed to the small sample sizes, study design or population substructure. Chronic inflammation causes oxidative and nitrative DNA damage in stem cells, which might be one of the processes behind the observed positive relationship between dietary inflammatory index (DII) and BC [54].  There are probably differences in the definitions of diets in different studies, so we used the most common definition. However, there are some limitations to this meta-analysis, as such, the results are combined from studies conducted with different methods in different populations, resulting in heterogeneity. Among several potential explanations, recall bias occurs a lot in case control studies rather than cohort studies.",7dd8b15c-0c7d-48b8-bfa0-afc486dd1fa5
28,discussion7," Moreover, a possible misclassification within the considered dietary patterns may existed. We cannot generalize our results to the whole world because the most studies that we found were from European and developed countries. As a result, more studies are needed, especially in Asian and African countries, to support these findings.  Conclusions  Our results specified a direct association between WD and risk of BC, and an inverse association between MD and risk of developing BC. Also, there was no association between dietary inflammatory index (DII) and BC risk. According to our findings dietary patterns might play an important role in BC prevention and guidelines might provide more attention to recommend consuming MD components and reducing WD components. However, further researches are needed to confirm our findings and to study the possible mechanisms for the WD effects on carcinogenesis of BC and MD and their effects on BC prevention.",895d2500-230d-4149-8f5c-8c4874844cc0
