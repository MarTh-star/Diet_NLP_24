0,methods0,"2.1. Design of the Study and Description of the Study Population A total of 3020 subjects were enrolled between 2015 and 2017 from different primary healthcare centers in an ongoing study dealing with subclinical atherosclerosis in Lleida, Catalonia, Spain Ilerda Vascular (Ilerda Vascular (ILERVAS)) project, ClinTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03228459) [24]. The inclusion criteria were as follows: women between the ages of 50 and 70 and men between the ages of 45 and 65 with the presence of at least one cardiovascular risk factor (such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, smoking, or having a first-degree relative with premature cardiovascular disease). The exclusion criteria were the presence of known pulmonary disease, prior medical history of cardiovascular disease, any type of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, active neoplasia, a life expectancy less than 18 months, and pregnancy.",878764d6-2dab-47c6-b1d6-be561d900b5e
1,methods1," The Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines were followed to classify participants into high risk (clinical coronary heart disease or a clinical coronary heart disease risk equivalent, such as other clinical forms of atherosclerotic disease (peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and symptomatic carotid artery disease) and diabetes), moderate risk (two or more cardiovascular risk factors), and low risk (0–1 risk factors) [25].Therefore, this is an initial cohort of asymptomatic population with a low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk that will be followed up until January 2025 to observe the onset of cardiovascular events [24,25].  2.2. Pulmonary Function Measurements Forced spirometry was done using a portable ultrasonic spirometer (Datospir©, Sibelmed, Barcelona, Spain). Pulmonary function examinations were performed by trained and certified pulmonary experts in agreement with the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society guidelines [26,27].",db3f2866-90ae-4ce6-90c8-7b77d8cd6b83
2,methods2," Subjects were required to achieve at least three reproducible maneuvers, and the outputs that produced the highest total of forced vital capacity (forced vital capacity (FVC)) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) were selected for the analysis. A bronchodilator test was not included in the evaluation of pulmonary function. The spirometric parameters were measured as a percentage of the predicted values, and included forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1, and the relationship between them (FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC)).   An anomalous FEV1 was defined as a value lower than 80% of that predicted. In addition, a “non-obstructive ventilatory defect” was well defined by an forced vital capacity (FVC) <80% of the predicted value with an FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio ≥70%, with a flow-volume curve showing a convex pattern.",3bec179c-aa5a-4ee1-b0bb-6cfd30cae8a9
3,methods3," Finally, an “obstructive ventilatory defect”, an unequal reduction of greatest airflow in relation to the maximal volume that can be displaced from the lung, was defined by an FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) <70% according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)) [27].  2.3. Adherence to Mediterranean Diet Assessment To quantitatively estimate the adherence to the MedDiet, we used the validated 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) that was developed to rapidly control for compliance with the dietary intervention in the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED)) trial [4,28]. Final scores ranged from 0 to 14 and categorized subjects according to their level of adherence to MedDiet: (i) high (score ≥ 11 points), (ii) moderate (7–10 points), and (iii) low (≤6 points) [28,29].  2.4.",337c9db4-58e6-41d0-9976-dac56fcd60c4
4,methods4," Physical Activity Level and Type Assessment  All participants also participated in the short version of The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)), a questionnaire developed for checking adults’ physical activity and inactivity [30]. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form inquires about three detailed types of activity undertaken in four domains: leisure time, domestic and gardening, work-related, and transport-related physical activity. The specific types of activity that were assessed were walking, and moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity actions. The metabolic equivalent of task (metabolic equivalent of task (MET)), a multiple of the resting metabolic rate, was calculated and was expressed in metabolic equivalent of task (MET)s per week.",802f66bc-2acc-47c9-98ff-e18083d2e567
5,methods5," Following International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) guidelines, the participants were classified as engaged in vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity, and low physical activity [30].   2.5. Covariate Assessment The smoking habit (never, former, or current smoker) was documented. Smokers who stopped smoking ≥1 year prior to enrolment were considered former smokers. Body weight and height were measured without shoes and slight clothes, and body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated from weight (kg) divided by height (meters) squared. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate, after relaxing at 2-min intervals, and the mean of the last two values was calculated (Omron M6, Omron Healthcare Europe BV, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands). Dried capillary blood testing was carried out to obtain levels of total cholesterol (mg/dL) using the system Reflotron® plus (Roche Diagnostics, Mannhein, Germany).   2.6.",7c006aa3-587d-429c-b8b9-0b80977b51e3
6,methods6," Ethical Approval  The protocol was approved by the Arnau de Vilanova University Hospital ethics committee (CEIC-1410). Additionally, the study was conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration, and Spanish legislation regarding the protection of personal information was also followed. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.  2.7. Statistical Analysis The normal distribution of the variables was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Owing to its skewed distribution, quantitative information was described using number (percentage) or the median (interquartile range). Participants were classified into three groups according to adherence to the MedDiet (high, moderate, and low) and in three other categories according to the frequency of physical activity (vigorous, moderate, and low).",1b2f860a-1efb-407a-80b1-2c8d4d0d2867
7,methods7," Main clinical data across categories of both MedDiet and physical activity were compared using the Krustal-Wallis test (with a Bonferroni post hoc analysis for pairwise comparisons) for continuous variables. The Pearson’s chi-squared test was used for categorical data. In addition, the relationship between continuous variables was assessed using the Spearman correlation test.  Three multivariable logistic regression models for the presence of an abnormal FEV1 (FEV1 < 80% of predicted), as well as non-obstructive and obstructive ventilatory defects for the development cohort, were done for each gender including the following confounding factors: age, body mass index, and both the adherence to the MedDiet and physical activity. The calibration and the discrimination of the logistic model were evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test of fit and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (receiver operating characteristic (ROC)) curve, respectively.",09b54d8d-c3e7-4701-b552-c56d8d60e9cf
8,methods8,"   We explored the joint associations of combining the adherence to the MedDiet (three categories) and physical activity practice (three categories) with FEV1 and the presence of ventilatory defects. Therefore, each participant was cross-allocated to one of the nine joint categories, and the low adherence to the MedDiet plus low physical activity practice was considered as the reference category. The interaction between the adherence to the MedDiet and physical activity practice in their associations with each outcome was examined by calculating the likelihood ratio test between the fully adjusted model and the same model including the interaction product.  All p-values were based on a two-sided test of statistical significance. Significance was accepted at the level of p < 0.050. All statistical analyses were completed using SSPS statistical package (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0., IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).  3.",9bc35604-a53c-4f2d-93ed-ed86e6c937f9
9,methods9," Results  Adherence to the MedDiet was primarily moderate (80.1%) in our middle-aged population without known pulmonary disease. Main clinical data according to levels of adherence to the MedDiet are displayed in Table 1. Participants with high adherence to the MedDiet were older, showed a superior prevalence of women and non-smoker subjects, and expended more weekly energy in comparison to subjects with lower adherence. In addition, participants who scored ≥11 points in the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire also exhibited significantly higher values of forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1 than subjects with lower values (forced vital capacity (FVC): 100 (87–109) vs. 94 (82–105) % of predicted, p = 0.003; FEV1: 100 (89–112) vs. 93 (80–107) % of predicted, p < 0.001), together with a lower prevalence of abnormal FEV1 and pulmonary patterns. Similar results were observed when participants with high and moderate adherence to the MedDiet were compared (Table 1).",fffab592-9a0e-44a5-91b1-45eef3f9fcd7
10,methods10," In addition, the total score of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire was slightly and negatively correlated with both forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1 value in the bivariate analysis (r = −0.046, p = 0.012 and r = −0.063, p = 0.001, respectively). As the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score results increased, the probability of anomalous FEV1 significantly declined (p = 0.020) (Figure 1).  Table 2 shows the clinical characteristics of the study population according to their physical activity measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) questionnaire. The physical activity was mostly low (62.2%) in our study population. Participants with vigorous physical activity were younger, mainly female, and with a lower body mass index in comparison to participants with low physical activity. However, their adherence to the MedDiet was similar between the three groups.",50df7157-81b2-469d-bca0-8ff345e1320a
11,methods11," Furthermore, when compared with participant with low physical activity, subjects with vigorous activity exhibited higher forced vital capacity (FVC) (100 (88–107) vs. 94 (83–105) % of predicted, p = 0.027) and higher FEV1 (100 (89–110) vs. 95 (84–108) % of predicted, p = 0.047), together with lower prevalence of abnormal FEV1 or ventilatory defects (Table 2). In the bivariate analysis, the final score of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) questionnaire showed a negative correlation with forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1 values (r = −0.102 and r = −0.073 respectively, p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Additionally, as the metabolic equivalents increased, the presence of abnormal FEV1 also decreased (p = 0.022) (Figure 1).",b1d4d65c-d0b8-478e-807d-3077579fbf2c
12,methods12,"   The multivariable logistic regression models (Table 3 and Table 4) showed that, in women, low and moderate adherence to the MedDiet were significant and independently associated with the presence of abnormal FEV1 and a non-obstructive ventilatory pattern, respectively. However, in men, low adherence to the MedDiet only predicted the existence of an obstructive ventilatory defect.  Finally, no interaction between adherence to the MedDiet and physical activity with the presence of abnormal FEV1, non-obstructive ventilatory patterns, or obstructive ventilatory patterns were observed.  4. Discussion The interventions to promote dietary lifestyle and physical activity changes for cardiovascular risk reduction are well established in adults [3,4,5,31,32]. This is the first study to analyze the associations between some lifestyle behaviors and respiratory function in a median-age population free from lung diseases but with the presence of at least one cardiovascular risk factor.",ad65e7b6-1325-4ff8-8806-9629a2f285ad
13,methods13," Interestingly, a low adherence to the MedDiet was associated with impaired spirometric values and higher prevalence of abnormal lung function when compared to participants with high adherence to this dietary pattern. Similarly, vigorous physical activity was accompanied by better results in lung function than that observed in inactive subjects. However, in our population, with a low percentage of participants with high adherence to the MedDiet (7.4%) and vigorous physical activity (3.3%), the coexistence of both characteristics was not associated with better spirometric results.   The MedDiet is a traditional dietary pattern that demonstrated valuable effects on health, quality of life, and longevity [1,2,33]. In fact, the MedDiet was shown to prevent cardiovascular events and premature total mortality owing its hypocholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties [12,13,14,15,34].",fa2810e3-44f5-490a-8e3a-4e09b68ca7be
14,methods14," In addition, a potential beneficial effect of the MedDiet on pulmonary function was previously evaluated in cross-sectional studies carried out in smokers and subjects with lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis [16,17,18,19]. Especially in asthma, the importance of the dietary pattern was highlighted in two systematic reviews and meta-analyses, concluding that adherence to the MedDiet may be effective in the prevention of asthma or wheeze in children; however, these associations are controversial in the case of adults [35,36]. Our study expands these results to a population without pulmonary disease, because, compared to those participants with high adherence to the MedDiet, those with low adherence had lower forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1 values during spirometric maneuvers and had a higher prevalence of abnormal lung function patterns.",dbce8b4f-5a65-408f-bb83-8dffc916d930
15,methods15,"   The mechanisms to explain the cluster of pulmonary benefits associated with high adherence to the MedDiet are not yet fully understood. However, it was argued that the most suitable explanation could be related with its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties associated with the high content of carotenoids, polyphenols, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and antioxidants contained in the food groups defining the MedDiet [37,38,39,40,41]. In this way, in case of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)) cohort, the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS)), and other studies, it was recognized that the combination and interaction of several nutrients may be more important than individual dietary components [39,41]. More recently, alterations in gut microbiome modulated by dietary intake were proposed as additional potential mechanisms modulating lung function [42].",7952acb2-1e34-426b-a3d5-9f1d58a181da
16,methods16,"  Moreover, the effect of the MedDiet over a four-week period reduced serum advanced glycation end products (AGEs) compared to the effect of a Western diet rich in saturated fat [43]. Similarly, a three-month hypocaloric diet promoting the consumption of typically MedDiet food was able to decrease serum N(ε)-carboxymethyl-lysine in overweight/obese premenopausal women [44]. In this way, our group recently showed that skin AGE deposition was associated with lower spirometric values and higher prevalence of abnormal ventilatory patterns in the Ilerda Vascular (ILERVAS) population, providing another mechanism explaining the association between diet and lung function [45].   On the other hand, strong evidence showed how physical activity practice may help patients with lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and cystic fibrosis, to improve better lung function and disease control [46,47,48].",991e00db-5765-4307-a421-602c287b0d51
17,methods17," Regarding healthy subjects, it is worth mentioning that higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with lesser decline in lung function across the lifespan [49]. Our results reinforce the protective effect of physical activity on lung function, showing how higher degrees of inactivity according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) score are independent risk factors for pulmonary impairment assessed by FEV1 <80% and non-obstructive ventilatory pattern.   Although, in our study, lung damage and respiratory abnormalities were of moderate magnitude and even subclinical, there could be a long-term deleterious impact. In this regard, after a 29-year follow-up of the Buffalo Health Study, FEV1 (% predicted) was demonstrated to be a long-term predictor for all-cause mortality, as well as ischemic heart disease [50].",f94cd074-78f3-4ae2-91e4-b135ae075949
18,methods18," Similarly, in another 26-year follow-up prospective study cohort including 1623 apparently healthy males aged 40–59 years, the relative risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and respiratory death increased by 10%, 7%, and 34% for each 10% of reduction in FEV1 [51]. These results were obtained after adjusting for smoking, age, systolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterol, and physical fitness [51].  Our results showed a sexual dimorphism regarding the impact of the MedDiet on pulmonary function. It was previously suggested that lung function may be influenced by sex-linked biological differences [52]. Dominelli et al. described that central airways in healthy women are significantly smaller than men, by approximately 30% [53]. Similarly, female smokers appeared to experience an accelerated decline in FEV1 compared with male smokers [54]. Additionally, women are usually exposed to different respiratory occupational risk factors than men [55].",46434880-5247-4adb-b102-804eddfb6161
19,methods19," Our data, with a different impact of the MedDiet on pulmonary function according to sex, reinforce the relevance of this variable when evaluating lung function.  The finding in our study of no interaction between adherence to the MedDiet and physical activity with pulmonary function deserves a comment, as their synergic effect was observed in other clinical situations. In this way, in people with impaired glucose tolerance, diet plus physical activity decreases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to standard treatment, without firm evidence of the effect of both components alone [56]. Similarly, a combined diet-plus-exercise program for a minimum of six months provided greater weight loss than a diet-only program among obese or overweight adults in eighteen randomized controlled trials [57].",ed3ab9a2-6d8b-4557-9aad-29daaee695bb
20,methods20," The effectiveness of exercise mode (aerobic training, resistance training, or combined) in influencing lung function also needs to be considered, as different effects were reported in improving functional status of dieting obese older adults [58]. In our study, the sample of participants with high adherence to the MedDiet was low, similar to the percentage of subjects who undertook vigorous physical activity (7.4% and 3.3%, respectively), preventing us from achieving sufficient statistical power to analyze the joint associations of combining adherence to the MedDiet and physical activity.  There are some potential limitations that should be considered in evaluating the results of our study. Firstly, the cross-sectional characteristic of the study limits us from establishing a causal relationship of the reported associations. Secondly, a post-bronchodilator spirometry to confirm the obstructive pattern was not conducted in our population.",c6b8c582-aefb-457e-9eaa-73134750c899
21,methods21," This test reduces the overall prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by approximately 33% in community-based health check-ups [59]. Thirdly, results from this study cannot be extrapolated to other populations, since our population comprised Spanish middle-aged individuals at low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk. Finally, no data about the total calorie intake are available from participants in our study. Moreover, the present study also has some strengths: the large study sample, the validated tools used, and the adjustment of the models for a large number of potential confounders.  To sum up, the present study provides initial clinical evidence about the independent and deleterious effect of both low adherence to the MedDiet and low physical activity practice on lung function in subjects without known pulmonary disease.",abc0d05b-55a3-479e-831a-936c024684fd
22,methods22, More prospective and clinical trial interventions are warranted in the future to confirm the effectiveness of a healthy diet and physical activity in preventing respiratory disorders. ,f4161aaa-3a17-4697-9938-6956714a6d38
