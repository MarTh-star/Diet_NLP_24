0,introduction0," An increasing body of evidence points to a number of natural polyphenols as protective tools against cell sufferance and death in a wide number of human pathologies spanning from neurodegenerative to cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes, including ageing. These molecules include compounds such as resveratrol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG)), curcumin, morin, quercetin and oleuropein aglycone (oleuropein aglycone (OLE)) found in a number of foods of plant origin and believed to be at the basis of the claimed beneficial properties of these foods [1].",9c83149a-4a5c-402a-9e3c-f23444def9ad
1,introduction1," The wide interest raised around these molecules as potential tools to combat such a wide range of diseases or, at least, to reduce the severity of their symptoms and/or age of occurrence has prompted many groups to investigate various aspects of their physiological actions both at the cellular and molecular level and in animal models of a number of pathological conditions, particularly cancer, inflammatory, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases [2,3]. A number of shared properties of these compounds includes their anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic power, and many benefits following their intake have been rationalised in the light of these recognised effects. However, more recently, other properties of these compounds arising from their interaction with cellular systems and potentially explaining their beneficial effects have been described.",5ed81b59-0dd9-4a14-a101-b1ad0ec88b61
2,introduction2," One of these is their ability to raise, in a number of different cell types, the autophagic response involved in protection against neurodegeneration, liver and vascular diseases [4-6].  Autophagy is a key process involved in cell homeostasis of proteins (proteostasis), lipids and organelles and contributes to clear materials of endogenous or exogenous origin. Together with the ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy participates to cellular proteostasis as one of the two main pathways of intracellular proteolysis, even though the former applies to the short-lived intracellular proteins, whereas the latter concerns proteins with longer half-lives. Autophagy encompasses the different routes used by cells to deliver cytoplasmic substrates to lysosomes through the formation of autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with lysosomes to form autophagolysosomes [7].",98bba85b-320b-4569-a6cf-e6d7c76827f0
3,introduction3," Usually, autophagy is triggered upon starvation, however it can be activated also by the presence of deposited materials as well as to degrade aged cellular organelles, principally mitochondria (mitophagy). Autophagy efficiency declines with age, with consequent accumulation of harmful protein aggregates and damaged mitochondria, which leads to increased ROS production [8]. The resulting increased cell stress favors inflammation and cell death [9].  Canonical autophagy, also known as macroautophagy, is a highly conserved process shared by all organisms which can be triggered in different ways and requires the participation of over 20 ATG proteins in yeast. The most straightforward path requires the inhibition of a cytoplasmic kinase receptor, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).",93851318-6559-4c01-95b1-4a60a70e340f
4,introduction4," mTOR forms two functionally distinct protein-mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) that are at the centre of an intricate, and still incompletely described, signalling pathway that is activated in response to a number of stress stimuli [10]. At the onset of the process, these complexes control the activation of the autophagy-initiating kinase (ULK1). mTORC1 inactivation in response to nutrient deprivation results in the activation of the ULK1 complex with ensuing induction of autophagy [7]. Autophagy senses, among others, the energy status of the cell and therefore responds to any cytosolic alteration of the AMP/ATP ratio which, in turn, signals to a number of kinases including liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK)).",8fe7fd85-f0ca-4446-a1d3-23bf2e23db26
5,introduction5," adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) is activated upon phosphorylation by a number of upstream kinases including LKB1 and calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ ), the latter in response to free Ca2+ increase, following the stimulation of the cAMP-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)/Akt and calpain-G-stimulatory protein α (Gsα) pathways [11]. In turn, activated adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) promotes autophagy by phosphorylation and activation of ULK1 [12] and inhibition of mTORC1.  Autophagy abnormalities may contribute to many different pathophysiological conditions [13]; thus autophagy is increasingly considered as a promising target to treat a number of pathologies, particularly those associated with neurodegeneration [10] as well as ageing [14].",4ce9492f-e954-45ba-8f1e-84f600149178
6,introduction6," Actually, increased mTOR activity has been reported in cellular and animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [15] as well as in Huntington animal models and disease [16, 17]; inducing autophagy can also be beneficial in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [18].  Plant polyphenols are able to regulate autophagy in several ways. In particular, some polyphenols, such as resveratrol and epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG), appear to promote the autophagic pathway by increasing cytosolic Ca2+ levels and activating adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) by the CaMKKβ [4-6, 8]. Our previous data have highlighted the beneficial effects of oleuropein aglycone (OLE) against protein/peptide aggregation in vitro [19, 20].",deaa55e5-37af-4624-9acc-799ad8cfee38
7,introduction7," More importantly, our findings showed that TgCRND8 mice, a strain widely used as a model of amylod beta (Aβ) peptide deposition, fed with oleuropein aglycone (OLE) displayed strongly improved performance in behavioural and cognitive tests; this effect was paralleled by reduced plaque load and plaque disassembly, in the affected brain areas, reduced inflammatory response, recovered dysfunctions of transgene-induced long-term potentiation (long term potentiation (LTP)) in the CA1 hippocampal area and reduced production of the pyro-Glu-Aβ 3-42 peptide, a recognised amyloid nucleator. These effects were, at least in part, accompanied and explained by epigenetic modifications [21] and, most remarkably, by a strong activation of autophagy [22, 23]. Autophagy stimulation by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) agrees with the data previously reported for other plant polyphenols [24, 25], however, at variance with those, our data did not highlight any mechanistic explanation.",21b83fd3-d615-478a-a26f-7471a9a69462
8,introduction8," To fill this gap and to expand the knowledge in the field not only in cultured cells but also in model animals, we investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms of autophagy induction by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) both in vitro in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and in vivo in TgCRND8 mice.

Finally, the cells were washed three times with the same solution (1 × Assay Buffer-FCS 10%) and the coverslips were placed on microscope slides. The stained cells were analyzed by using a confocal Leica TCS SP5 scanning microscope (Mannheim, Germany) equipped with an argon laser source for fluorescence measurements at 488 nm and a Leica Plan Apo 63 × oil immersion objective. A series of optical sections (1024 × 1024 pixels) 1.0 μm in thickness was taken through the cell depth for each examined sample.

Statistical analysis of the bands was performed on results from at least three independent experiments, using ANOVA and Bonferroni's post-test.  Measurement of intracellular Ca2+ levels The cytosolic levels of free Ca2+ were measured by using the Fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-3AM) probe (Molecular Probes) whose fluorescence largely increases in response to Ca2+ binding. Subconfluent SH-SY5Y cells grown on glass coverslips were treated with 50 μM oleuropein aglycone (OLE) for different time periods.",eae4271f-06e6-4969-8402-534b025ab1a0

18,results0," oleuropein aglycone (OLE) induces a biphasic increase in adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation at its regulatory Thr172 We previously showed that diet supplementation with oleuropein aglycone (OLE) strongly ameliorates AD-associated symptoms in TgCRND8 mice, a model of Aβ deposition, in several ways, including induction of autophagy [21-23]; a similar behaviour was also shown in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-treated murine N2a neuroblastoma cells [23]. We therefore sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying autophagy activation by investigating at which level oleuropein aglycone (OLE) interfered with the autophagy cascade in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Previous data suggested that other polyphenols, such as resveratrol and epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG), promote the autophagy flux by increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ levels with subsequent activation of adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) by CaMKKβ [4-6].",112f7bf1-df53-4a11-ae9a-f982c0d3f98b
19,results1," Therefore, our primary aim was to assess if the molecular mechanism of autophagy induction in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-exposed SH-SY5Y cells was similar to that previously reported for other natural polyphenols. To do this, we initially exposed the cells to 50 μM oleuropein aglycone (OLE) for 24 h, the conditions we previously reported to trigger autophagy in N2a cells [23] and then checked the cells for both Beclin-1 level (whose increase is an early marker of autophagy) and adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. However, no variation in the phosphorylation of the adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) catalytic subunit at the regulatory Thr172 residue was observed at these conditions in spite of a significant increase in Beclin-1 expression (Figure 1A).",15fcd5a3-9f41-4d69-9b0b-95bda586f4f6

This negative result prompted us to explore whether an hypothetical oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-mediated adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activation was an early event that disappeared after 24 h of cell treatment. In order to reduce the time frame of our treatments, at first we checked if autophagy was induced in SH-SY5Y cells after only 4 h of cell treatment with 50 μM oleuropein aglycone (OLE). At these conditions, autophagic vacuoles staining was evident suggesting that autophagy was indeed triggered even at this short time of treatment (Figure 1B).

To this purpose, we investigated the trend of the increase of intracellular free Ca2+ in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-treated cells to check whether it was associated to the biphasic character of adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. By using the fluorescent probe Fluo3-AM we found an early increase of the cytosolic Ca2+ after 5′-10′ of oleuropein aglycone (OLE) treatment, with a subsequent decrease at 30′ (yet significantly above the basal level) followed by a late increase after 1-2 h, while after 5 h the Ca2+ level was no more significantly different from the basal level (Figure 2).",5fad3d9f-895c-4d1c-8f34-9d8a7d5a7105

At these conditions, we found that only CPA abolished the oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-induced Ca2+ increase, whereas cell treatment with EGTA did not induce any significant effect (Figure 3), suggesting that the free Ca2+ increase in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-treated cells resulted from ER release. We concluded that, in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-treated cells, adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation paralleled Ca2+ increase coming from the ER, which suggested a pivotal role of the Ca2+-activated CaMKKβ.",a6e909d6-516a-49d6-a7ce-368eace8a66c

29,results11," Therefore, we investigated whether such a short-time treatment was sufficient to trigger autophagy and, if so, whether Ca2+ increase and CaMKKβ activation did play a role.

Then the cells were washed and incubated for 5 h in complete fresh medium after which autophagy induction was measured. At these conditions, the cells displayed a significant increase in autophagic vacuoles staining (Figure 5A), suggesting that autophagy activation resulting from Ca2+ release from the ER in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-treated cells is an early event, and that longer times of incubation with oleuropein aglycone (OLE) are not needed for autophagy induction. In fact, the latter was absent in cells pre-treated with CPA, confirming that Ca2+ release from the ER induced by a short acute (10 min) stimulus by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) is essential for autophagy activation.",21fdc954-bef4-410b-a53c-b30dcd8d4478

We expected no autophagy induction in the presence of CC; however, we observed that autophagy was still activated, though to a reduced extent, at these conditions. To explain this effect, we checked whether CC induced basic autophagy in control cells; actually, we observed that CC is an autophagy activator per se (independently of any effect on adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activity) in this cell line (Figure 6), as it was previously reported for other cancer cells [27, 28].",bf51416c-9ba4-4105-9539-bdd7f5c96db2
34,results16," Nevertheless, CC, even though did not completely abolish, significantly reduced oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-autophagy activation, suggesting a strong prevalence of the pathway proceeding through adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) even in this case. To confirm this hypothesis, we used a different, CC-insensitive, cell line chosen after testing a panel of different lines. We found an useful model in the rat pancreatic insulinoma RIN-5F cells, in which CC does not trigger autophagy. In these cells, oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-treatment activated autophagy similarly to what observed in SH-SY5Y cells but this effect was significantly counteracted by cell pretreatment with CC, as shown both by autophagic vacuoles staining (Figure 7A) and by western blot analysis of LC-3 II (Figure 7B).",6a5bceca-c042-41ab-bee8-2b36d0dd96b7
35,results17," These results fully confirmed, in a different cell line, that the activation of adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) signaling plays a paramount role in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-induced autophagy, supporting the hypothesis that autophagy activation occurs mainly, if not exclusively, through the path oleuropein aglycone (OLE) - Ca2+ increase - CaMKKβ activation - adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation.

37,results19,"  oleuropein aglycone (OLE) inhibits mTOR via activation of adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in the cortex of TgCRND8 mice To confirm and extend in tissue the proposed mechanism of autophagy activation by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) in cultured cells, we used TgCRND8 mice, an in vivo model, of Aβ deposition which mimics some features of AD. We previously reported that oleuropein aglycone (OLE) supplementation for 8 weeks to daily food of TgCRND8 mice induces an intense autophagic response and lysosomal activity in the cortex of animals of different ages (23). On the basis of these data, we explored the involvement of mTOR and adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-triggered autophagy in the cortical tissue of 6/12 month-old TgCRND8 mice fed with oleuropein aglycone (OLE).",3c3602ff-a6ec-4877-ac13-a7a2ad8608ac
38,results20," As expected, in the cortex of control, oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-untreated, TgCRND8 mice we found enhanced phospho-mTOR immunoreactivity (Figure 8A) and increased levels of the phosphorylated mTOR substrate p70 S6K (Figure 8B); however, these modifications were markedly reduced in the cortex of oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed TgCRND8 mice, where no significant differences with controls were detected. These data further support the idea that autophagy activation by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) proceeds through mTOR inhibition. Next, we assessed whether the latter matched adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activation; we found enhanced levels of phospho-adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK), and hence adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activation, in the cortex of oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed TgCRND8 mice as compared to untreated animals (Figure 6C).",172aedbf-d066-4dc6-8331-5b79349e3bca
39,results21," Altogether, these data indicate that in the cortex of oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed TgCRND8 mice the activation of autophagy likely occurs following adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activation, and that the latter matches mTOR inhibition. No age-related differences in both mTOR and adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) data were detected in 6 month-old and in 12 month-old mice, thus the two age groups were pooled and reported as 6/12 months. Taken together, these results confirm those obtained with cultured cells and match those previously reported with a different neuroblastoma cell line [23], confirming that comparable molecular mechanisms of oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-autophagy activation are present both in cultured cells and in tissue.",9932c32f-0a14-46ea-8ca0-8bd364513286

41,discussion0," A growing body of research has shown that polyphenols of plant origin have beneficial properties against ageing and a number of pathological conditions spanning from cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, age-related metabolic deterioration and diseases including type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome and neurodegenerative diseases. The presence of plant polyphenols at substantial levels in a number of foods that characterize the Mediterranean and the Asian diets, has been recognized as a leading explanation of the benefits for health of these alimentary regimens [1, 29]. Plant polyphenols possess a number of properties that can contribute to explain their effects on health, the most recognized being their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-aggregation power. However, these properties, although of importance, cannot explain by themselves the remarkable effects of these molecules that appear not generic but, rather, very specific, even though shared.",b5b5394f-5563-427a-9182-845929cdcd85
42,discussion1," In fact, they are able to impact on cell viability by interfering with a number of basic processes including transcriptional regulation through epigenetic effects and autophagy [8, 21, 23].  Recent research has sought to decipher the polyphenol-cell biology relations by investigating some of these substances that are present in foods of large use including red wine, green tea, extra virgin olive oil and the turmeric. The data reported in recent years have shown that specific polyphenols such as resveratrol, epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG) and curcumin are able to elicit the autophagic response thus improving such housekeeping tool that results in increased cell longevity and favors the clearance of misfolded/aggregated peptides and proteins in several human amyloid diseases [8].",c19accfb-29c4-4a89-a069-7bc1ca06a530
43,discussion2,"  It is widely known that autophagy activation can result from different pathways including the phospho-inositol-(IP3) signalling, the Ca2+-calpains-Gsα pathways [30], in addition to the Ca2+ -CaMKKβ (LKB1)-adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK)-mTOR pathway. The molecular basis of autophagy activation by a number of polyphenols have been investigated; they include the pivotal role of adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK), a heterotrimeric Ser/Thr kinase, that is activated by several upstream kinases, including LKB1 and CaMKKβ, and, in turn, negatively controls mTOR, a potent inhibitor of autophagy [31-33]. CaMKKβ is activated by free Ca2+, whose cytosolic levels appear important to initiate the autophagy flux. Ca2+ increase seems to be the main upstream biochemical modification induced by several polyphenols as well as a primary cause that eventually leads to the activation of autophagy.",9817820c-b8ed-4799-870a-c2410f4367d0
44,discussion3," However, at present, it cannot be concluded that this is a basic effect shared by plant polyphenols known to be protective against ageing and disease, nor whether different polyphenols trigger different autophagy pathways.  Recently, we have shown that, in the TgCRND8 mice, oleuropein aglycone (OLE) administration with the food results in reduction of Aβ peptide production and neuroinflammation; more remarkably, it induces other significant effects, restoring long term potentiation (LTP), reducing the number and compactness of the plaques, activating the microglia and, most importantly, promoting an intense autophagic response [21, 23]. However, nothing was known at the molecular level about the mechanism of the latter effect. In this study we tried to fill the gap by investigating some molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy activation by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) both in vitro in neuronal cells and in vivo in TgCRND8 mice.",665b71e5-2b3d-4821-ad11-c47ee88a51bd
45,discussion4," In the latter, the activation of adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) which, in turn, negatively modulates mTOR, could underlie the previously reported oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-induced intense autophagic and lysosomal response in the brain cortex of oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed mice [23].  Here, we found that oleuropein aglycone (OLE) induces autophagy in cultured neuroblastoma cells by a mechanism substantially in accordance with those previously reported for other polyphenols, confirming that in cells treated with polyphenols the Ca2+/CaMKKβ/adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK)/mTOR axis is actually at work. We found that the Ca2+ rise in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-treated cells was the result of Ca2+ exit from the intracellular stores rather than of its entry from the external medium. This implies that oleuropein aglycone (OLE) penetrates inside the cell though the plasmamembrane without damaging it.",e9a2038f-b3c3-4f8b-884c-8e94b3d93324
46,discussion5," We did not checked the presence of oleuropein aglycone (OLE) inside the cells, however, this would not be surprising, considering that the molecule is hydrophobic. Moreover, such a possibility is supported by a recent report where it has clearly been shown that compounds from olive leaves, including oleuropein aglycone (OLE), are found inside treated cells in a breast-cancer cell line [34]. We have previously reported that a time-dependent decrease of phosphorylation of the mTOR substrate p70 S6K occurs in N2a cells, a different neuroblastoma cell line, treated with oleuropein aglycone (OLE) at the same concentration used in this study [23], confirming that autophagy activation by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) proceeds through adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activation and mTOR inhibition.",9aec9cb5-23dc-42d5-b037-e38ab7d5d7e1
47,discussion6," Of interest, in the same study, adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activation was evident at 3-6 h of oleuropein aglycone (OLE) treatment, a time similar to that at which, in this study, we found the highest peak of adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that autophagy activation by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) proceeds via the adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK)/mTOR signalling pathway. That a panel of coherent, yet not completely matching, results were found with different cultured cells does not weakens the take-home message of this study; rather it strengthens it, confirming that similar molecular mechanisms underlie oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-induced activation of autophagy in different cell types as well as in mouse tissue.  The above considerations open intriguing consequences.",a0323ef3-1bb3-481c-9739-c895f350ff5f
48,discussion7," For example, it has been repeatedly reported that some polyphenols, including oleuropein aglycone (OLE), are able to induce epigenetic modifications, in terms of histone acetylation and DNA methylation, particularly in cancer cells [35] and that, in the brain of oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed TgCRND8 mice, modified expression levels of key proteins including glutaminyl cyclase, Beclin-1, LC-3 II and histone deacetylase-2 were found [21]. In such a scenario the transcriptor factor EB (transcriptor factor EB (TFEB)), a transcriptional regulator of lysosomal biogenesis that controls the expression of central autophagy genes [4-6], could perform an important role; in fact, it appears to be inhibited upon phosphorylation by mTORC and activated upon dephosphorylation by calcineurin, a phosphatase that has recently been shown to be activated by lysosomal Ca2+ [36].",22ce138e-6c6b-4622-ab4a-17d190e94ade
49,discussion8," Hence, autophagy appears to be regulated by Ca2+ signals coming from different cell stores that affect independently but, possibly, synergistically, the autophagic flux. In this context, the Ca2+/CaMKKβ/adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK)/mTOR axis could synergize with calcineurin maintaining transcriptor factor EB (TFEB) in a de-phosphorylated, and hence activated, form for longer time periods. An aspect that merits further investigation.  Another aspect of potential interest is represented by the positive control exerted by insulin and several growth factors on mTORC that should result in reduced ability to trigger autophagy and, possibly, reduced synergy to the calcineurin effects. Impaired insulin sensitivity, with increased insulin incretion, is a common phenomenon in aged people that can affect autophagy efficiency [37, 38]. Accordingly, type 2 diabetes could find a right place in such a scenario.",1b8181cb-effc-47cb-9f04-c08d9f9a22a5
50,discussion9," Actually, it has recently been shown that autophagy activation through positive control of transcription of key autophagy genes is decreased under conditions of insulin resistance [39].  In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the mechanism of autophagy activation by polyphenols resides on quite general effects of these substances on cell regulatory mechanisms underlying the control of autophagy. Our data add further knowledge to the molecular basis of oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-induced autophagy that confirms and extends our previous studies carried out both in vivo and with a different cell line. When added to the available literature, our findings provide strong support to the idea that plant polyphenols are indeed useful to treat ageing and age-related diseases where autophagy dysfunction plays an important role such as cancer, neurodegeneration and type 2 diabetes thus reinforcing the theoretical basis for their use to combat these conditions.
