0,introduction0,"On a global scale, prostate cancer is an important health consideration. It is the fourth most common cancer internationally, and in men ranks second only to lung cancer . Prostate cancer incidence is highest in developed nations, compared to less-developed countries, a difference that is only partially explained by the higher use of prostate specific antigen (prostate specific antigen (PSA)) as a screening tool in developed nations . In New Zealand, cancer of the prostate is the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality, with death rates disproportionately higher in Māori men (28.7 c.f. 16.7 deaths per 100,000 (age-standardised rates per 100,000) male population, standardised to the WHO world standard population) (MOH, 2013).  Worldwide patterns of prostate cancer incidence and mortality support the hypothesis that diet and lifestyle are likely contributors to both development and progression of this malignancy.",f4cbf12c-997b-4ba9-b03b-1efb61168d70
1,introduction1," Furthermore, alterations in risk associated with migratory patterns and the westernisation of dietary patterns associated with globalisation (Baade, Youlden & Krnjacki, 2009; Melnik, John & Schmitz, 2011) give added credence to this theory.  Chronic inflammation and infection have been implicated in the development of around one-fifth of all cancers , including prostate cancer . Other influences include genetic and epigenetic factors , imbalances between reactive oxygen species and antioxidants, and DNA damage (Waris & Ahsan, 2006) (Fig. 1).  10.7717/peerj.1080/fig-1Figure 1 Factors involved in the pathogenesis of tumour development (Pantuck et al., 2006; Waris & Ahsan, 2006). The role of inflammation in prostate cancer is unclear. Elevated levels of inflammatory markers have been associated with high-grade prostate cancer in some studies (Shariat et al., 2001; Platz & De Marzo, 2004; Huffman et al., 2006; Gurel et al.",439123ea-19d0-435c-8ae5-8cf4d8b2264a
2,introduction2,", 2014) but not in others (Il’yasova et al., 2005; Stark et al., 2009). Systemic inflammation has been associated with earlier cancer mortality (McArdle, Qayyum & McMillan, 2010; Shafique et al., 2012), which adds weight to an argument for a detrimental effect of chronic inflammation and the potential benefit of alow-inflammatory diet.  Increased levels of free radicals and pro-oxidant compounds (Arsova-Sarafinovska et al., 2009; Qu et al., 2013; Kanwal et al., 2014), and decreased levels of antioxidant enzymes have been found in prostate tissue , and in association with prostate cancer (Arsova-Sarafinovska et al., 2009). Both prostatic cancer cells and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia are notably deficient in the important endogenous antioxidant, glutathione S-transferase (Platz & De Marzo, 2004). This may be due to inflammation-induced inactivation of genes that have roles in cellular protection and restoration of damaged DNA (Kundu & Surh, 2012).",62041509-4e5d-4af0-b317-42d16c8c5851
3,introduction3," Reduction in the ability of cells to produce protective antioxidants may occur due to alterations in cell morphology, leaving the prostate vulnerable to damage by carcinogenic compounds that might otherwise be neutralised by antioxidants. Indeed, proliferative inflammatory atrophy, a precursor to development of prostate cancer, is a cellular change that is postulated to be the result of cell damage (Platz & De Marzo, 2004; Brawer, 2005).  The Mediterranean diet has been extensively examined and its benefits in terms of reductions in oxidative stress and inflammation are generally well-accepted (Urpi-Sarda et al., 2012; Viscogliosi et al., 2013). This dietary style is centered on consumption of high amounts of extra virgin olive oil, fruit and vegetables, pulses and legumes, whole-grains, and poultry, along with some fish and seafood. Intake of red meat, dairy products and processed or refined foods is traditionally low .",5d65917d-bd18-4ad8-814b-8e75bd9f9070
4,introduction4," Deviation away from such a pattern, towards a more western-style diet, has been associated with increased prostate cancer incidence (Ambrosini et al., 2008; Stott-Miller, Neuhouser & Stanford, 2013). Couto et al. (2011) examined data from the large European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) study and concluded that a Mediterranean diet is particularly beneficial in protecting against breast, colon, and prostate cancer.  The brassica family is not emphasised in general Mediterranean diet guidelines. However, this family of vegetables has attracted much interest in recent years, primarily on account of the levels of glucosinolates, which are particularly high in broccoli . Nutrigenomic effects of broccoli are discussed in detail in Ferguson & Schlothauer (2012).",df684773-4af9-4fe0-a655-e97db735708d
5,introduction5,"  Pomegranate, and its juice, has received a great deal of attention related to potential chemo-protective effects, including beneficial effects in slowing of prostate-specific antigen (prostate specific antigen (PSA)) doubling time in men with prostate cancer (Pantuck et al., 2006; Pantuck et al., 2009; Paller et al., 2012). This benefit is attributed to high levels of polyphenols (particularly punicalagin, an elligatannin ), that contribute to pomegranate’s overall antioxidant capacity, which is greater than either red wine or green tea . Polyphenols are also high in extra virgin olive oil, red wine, and green tea (Tuck & Hayball, 2002). These phytochemicals have demonstrable epigenetic effects , which may account for at least some of the benefits attributed to their consumption. As pomegranate is found throughout the Mediterranean area, it is logical to assume it would be commonly consumed in the region.",b8225a6f-35d8-4b4b-a918-4be152d02a31
6,introduction6," However, this has not been reported in nutritional research which focuses on Mediterranean dietary patterns. It is quite possible that pomegranate may be a contributor to documented advantages associated with diets in the Mediterranean region.  High fibre diets, including consumption of legumes and whole grains, have been linked to a wide range of health benefits. Legumes are an important food group in the Mediterranean diet (Ferrís-Tortajada et al., 2012), and have been associated with reduced prostate cancer risk (Chan, Lok & Woo, 2009). Consumption of legumes (particularly soy) is significant in Asian diets where prostate cancer incidence is also low (Chan, Lok & Woo, 2009). Mechanisms for benefit are numerous and include: high fibre content, which may be advantageous by reduction of post-prandial glycaemia (Gropper, Stepnick & Smith, 2013), lower levels of insulin-like growth factor , and increases in sex hormone binding globulin .",4c6424b5-67f4-4be1-b2a1-f51dae1f5f4f
7,introduction7," The minimisation of post-prandial rises in blood sugar level is desirable in men with prostate cancer, due to glycaemia-associated increases in markers of inflammation and oxidative stress . Additionally, foods that promote a high glycaemic response induce insulin and insulin-like growth factor (Melnik, John & Schmitz, 2011), which may contribute to prostate cancer progression .  In some studies (Gao, LaValley & Tucker, 2005; Koh et al., 2006; Allen et al., 2008), but not all (Huncharek, Muscat & Kupelnick, 2008; Pettersson et al., 2012), consumption of dairy foods has been linked to higher risk of developing prostate cancer. Risk has been associated with the quantity consumed  and dairy intake during adolescence . Prostate cancer mortality has also been correlated to milk consumption .",b93bfa8d-949b-4645-9c30-d3ad2b6e4402
8,introduction8," While these data are inconclusive, it does, nonetheless, raise concerns over the recommendation of dairy as a source of calcium for men at risk of developing osteoporosis, including those with prostate cancer who have had hormonal ablation treatment .  Fish is not considered a major component of Mediterranean diets , but is generally considered preferential to red meat for men with prostate cancer (Terry et al., 2001; Chavarro et al., 2008; Bosire et al., 2013). Fish is regarded as a good source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, promoting anti-inflammatory pathways , which has been considered to be desirable in men for whom lowering inflammation is a goal. However, the benefit of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in prostate cancer has recently been challenged . The role of dietary fats in prostate cancer is discussed in more detail by Bishop et al. (2015).",ecb6c1c0-be6a-4b28-aace-2c63c6a57dc0
9,introduction9,"  Green tea is not a dietary feature in the Mediterranean region but is a common beverage in East Asian countries, where mortality rates from prostate cancer are the lowest, globally . A mounting volume of evidence supports the recommendation of consumption of green tea, due to its antioxidant potential, largely from polyphenols, in particular epigallocatechin-3-gallate (epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG)) . epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG) has documented anti-proliferative properties  and affords protection to DNA in prostate cells . Furthermore, green tea consumption has been associated with lower prostate cancer incidence  and reduced risk of progression to advanced disease .",c2b36889-3444-4e1e-8b04-a1416ab5e0b2

28,discussion1,"  Adherence to a low inflammatory diet such as that used in this study may help to mitigate inflammation-associated increases in oxidative stress, genomic instability and damage to DNA (Kundu & Surh, 2012).  Inflammation was evaluated by measuring C-reactive protein, a non-specific acute phase protein that serves as a surrogate for interleukin 6, an inflammatory cytokine associated with angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastases. Within 6 h of an inflammatory assault, C-reactive protein increases. Constant levels are maintained commensurate with inflammatory processes and rapid clearance occurs when the stimulus is removed (Pepys & Hirschfield, 2003). No change in C-reactive protein was observed in our cohort after three months of the dietary intervention, which is in contrast to other studies using a similar dietary regimen .",0705dc0a-6e79-4886-b78a-5d67d7ddbe53
29,discussion2," Noteworthy in this regard is that baseline C-reactive protein in this group was low, with 95% of the cohort within the normal range of <5 mg/L, leaving little room for improvement. An inverse association between C-reactive protein and physical activity levels that was noted at the outset of this study was not evident at study end. Medication did not change in the group, with the exception of one participant who ceased taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during the study period. There was no resultant increase in C-reactive protein in this participant.  The effect of excess adiposity is an important consideration on the results seen. Obesity is a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state, which has been associated with both incidence and progression of prostate cancer . It was expected that study participants, four of whom were obese at the beginning of the study, might lose weight by following the dietary recommendations (Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2012).",a1523605-c0c4-4287-a8c3-02a4f924b5ac
30,discussion3," This did occur (mean weight loss 2.3 kg), and while desirable in overweight men, may have masked anti-inflammatory attributes of the diet. When stored adipose tissue is catabolised, the pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid, tends to be liberated . Thus true benefit in terms of lowering of inflammation might be better observed once body weight has stabilised. This would be best assessed following a longer intervention. No significant associations between body weight, BMI (or changes thereof) and DNA damage were noted in this study. C-reactive protein responds to a number of factors. Participants were not evaluated for injury or opportunistic infection at either the beginning or end of the study. While men retrospectively reported that they were “well” at the time of both blood draws, minor injuries or low-grade infections have the potential to increase acute phase inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein included.",c1154bd1-3407-4671-996f-c0f8d6f6dfc8
31,discussion4," Similarly, study participants were not assessed for other factors that might impact C-reactive protein, such as sleep disturbances (Meier-Ewert et al., 2004) and food intake the day of sample collection (Margioris, 2009; Farnetti et al., 2011).  Levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) were largely unchanged over the course of the study. However, prostate specific antigen (PSA) was below the level of detection in the majority of study participants, as is associated with successful treatment of prostate cancer. The lack of change in prostate specific antigen (PSA), particularly in those men who had not undergone treatment for prostate cancer (n = 6), may indicate benefit in terms of prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time. While this is best evaluated over a longer period of time, mitigation of prostate specific antigen (PSA) increases have been demonstrated after 3 months of a dietary shift towards a more plant-based pattern .",1d2e5bda-7ad1-4215-9bc9-14784e939081

The health advantages of a diet that is high in fruit and vegetables, ostensibly due to the diversity of nutrients, with high levels of antioxidants and fibre associated with such dietary patterns is generally accepted.Indeed, lower levels of inflammation and increases in antioxidants have been correlated to fruit and vegetable intake . While not all studies concur , there is evidence suggesting benefit from vegetable and fruit intake in regards to prostate cancer (Riso et al., 1999; Hardin, Cheng & Witte, 2011; Shahar et al., 2011).  The main benefit (weight loss aside) associated with this dietary intervention was reduction in DNA damage after three months, when compared to baseline data. This outcome was inversely associated with dietary adherence (p = 0.013).",98afcc71-5d9a-48af-9914-41d43b732593
33,discussion6,"  Three months is considered sufficient time to determine the impact of diet on DNA repair in lymphocytes. As part of the circulatory system lymphocytes are constantly exposed to the positive and negative effects of diet and lifestyle. Therefore, they are an ideal target cell to assess the nutritional or chemical effect on DNA damage, regardless of their age. Other studies have demonstrated the effect of dietary on DNA repair in lymphocytes in as little as 21  and 24 days .  DNA damage has been positively associated with prostate cancer risk , hence increased DNA protection and repair is a highly desirable outcome, further supporting the benefit of a diet high in antioxidants and low in saturated fat. Specific foods and nutrients, particularly antioxidants and polyphenol compounds, can positively affect DNA repair (Duthie et al., 1996; Giovannelli et al., 2002; Machowetz et al., 2007; Guarnieri et al., 2008).",e965ea5d-3a03-483f-b1ef-20b6b4fd404f
34,discussion7," For example, consumption of green tea , broccoli  and vitamin C intake  have been associated with increased DNA repair in previous studies, while increases in DNA damage have been attributed to oxidative stress (Freitas et al., 2012; Kundu & Surh, 2012) and peroxidation of fatty acids (Gropper, Stepnick & Smith, 2013). The benefit of a Mediterranean diet on markers of DNA damage has been reported in women with the metabolic syndrome . As far as the authors are aware, this has not previously been reported in men with prostate cancer.  Diet is a complex interaction of a wide range of foods and numerous individual compounds. Genetic and epigenetic modifications can be affected by dietary phytonutrients, which modulate DNA methylation and may induce or enhance DNA repair, the isolation of these compounds is a commonly used, but reductionist approach, to nutritional research.",e6ebfec5-db9d-4051-b8a5-13396deda01c
35,discussion8," In this study, dietary adherence scores informed a comparison of the adoption of the diet as a whole, as well as the integration of various aspects of it. The aspects of this diet that study participants found the most acceptable were the incorporation of whole grains, olive oil, pomegranate juice, substitution of red meat for chicken, and reducing consumption of sweetened beverages. Each of these achieved >85% compliance overall. On the other hand, the least embraced components were inclusion of sofrito, green tea, vegetables, broccoli, and adoption of recommended guidelines for alcohol (in particular red wine). While compliance on these latter items was less than 60%, changes in most did reach statistical significance (Tables 4, 6 and 7).  It is apparent from the inverse association of adherence to the recommended diet with DNA damage that this overall dietary pattern could be of benefit for men with prostate cancer.",c39acd64-2987-4c79-94fb-dfe9ef38e156
36,discussion9," While the possibility exists that reduced damage to DNA may be attributable to other characteristics of this cohort, no parameter reported here suggests that this was the case. Other factors associated with the Mediterranean diet, when compared to a typical western diet, include alterations in the type of dietary fat and resultant changes in blood fatty acids. Such changes did occur in this study, as is evident by the decrease in energy from saturated fat (Fig. 2). Relationships between DNA damage, dietary fats and blood fatty acids are explored elsewhere .  An inquiry into relationships between individual food items and the benefits seen on this diet aids in justification of continued inclusion or otherwise in future studies. Such data is particularly useful when recommending the incorporation of foods that may be considered unusual and to support the development of strategies to aid increased compliance with less accepted recommendations.",3de16731-53ee-4eeb-a634-8ccac8c059f1
37,discussion10,"  While participants indicated that they were more inclined to choose chicken over red meat, overall complicity to the criteria for restriction of red meat consumption (to less than once weekly) did not indicate that this had actually occurred. In general, New Zealand consumption of beef and lamb is high (FAO, 2013), which is reflected in the baseline data. At the beginning of the study participants were consuming almost 4 servings of red and/or processed meat per week. Hence, while the reduction noted was significant (p < 0.001), intake was still higher than requested, suggesting that minimising red meat was a difficult change for participants to make. This may have been caused or compounded by the fact that this study was conducted over the summer period. The New Zealand summer coincides with the festive season during which barbeques, as social events, are a common aspect of the culture.Thus avoidance of red meat may have been challenging for some participants.",fc3ae6e7-9e5d-4ee6-9c96-046696ede573
38,discussion11," If indeed this was a major factor, it also raises the possibility that consumption of pro-carcinogenic heterocyclic amines, as is associated with meat cooked at high temperatures , may have negated some of the benefits of the overall diet.  Green tea was not well accepted, with palatability being the reported obstacle. Nevertheless, green tea intake was associated with significant reduction in DNA damage (p = 0.002). This is in alignment with the remarkable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties associated with green tea, which contribute to its effect on DNA methylation (Roda & Eubank, 2012). Green tea consumption was reported by 25% of participants at baseline and 60% at study end. However, less than half were consuming the recommended intake of 2 cups daily. This relatively low uptake, but notable benefit, suggests that the incorporation of a beneficial dietary component may result in substantial gains, even if target levels are not attained.",54364899-7e36-4f9a-8932-2835d4808ed0
39,discussion12,"  No associations were noted for broccoli intake, which is in contrast to other reports (Latté, Appel & Lampen, 2011; Ferguson & Schlothauer, 2012). However, the inverse correlation noted between folate intake and DNA damage is consistent with current understanding of the role of folate in DNA methylation (Gropper, Stepnick & Smith, 2013), and concurs with a recent study in which folate’s role in DNA stability was demonstrated (Ong, Moreno & Ross, 2011). In the current study, folate intake was calculated from diet diaries, and broccoli intake was determined from an adherence questionnaire, which was not sensitive to other sources of either folate or other cruciferous vegetables.  The role of vitamin C in regards to cancer is conflicting  making the finding of this study difficult to compare with other research.",447290b7-223e-4311-bca2-a0492b1a48b2
40,discussion13," A dose–response relationship has been observed in regards to protection from DNA damage, with increasing vitamin C benefiting those with low baseline levels . In our study a significant inverse association was apparent between vitamin C intake and DNA damage (p = 0.007) at study end. Dietary vitamin C in the cohort was not low (Table 6). Examination of the data indicated that the source of this water soluble antioxidant shifted from fruit at baseline to vegetables at the end of the study. However, overall vegetable intake did not change. Furthermore, vegetables are more likely to be consumed cooked, which reduces vitamin C content (Gropper, Stepnick & Smith, 2013). Together, this suggests that vitamin C was not solely associated with the effect noted, but rather, that a nutrient–nutrient interaction, such as with vitamin E, may have occurred. Vitamin E intake increased over the course of the study (p = 0.005) (Table 6).",589dde0f-4bf8-41d6-91e6-d854657b8cb7
41,discussion14,"This is congruent with current understanding of the synergistic relationship that exists between these two antioxidant vitamins (Gropper, Stepnick & Smith, 2013). A large prospective study by Wright et al. (2007) suggested that dietary (but not supplemental) vitamin E may be an important nutrient in reducing the risk of advanced prostate cancer.  Diet is a complex interaction of phytonutrients and it is an accumulative and/or synergistic effect of these that confers overall benefit. In other words, overall dietary patterns are possibly more important than individual components—a concept that has been proposed elsewhere .  From the results, it appears that the adoption of such a dietary pattern is feasible in motivated men. Not only were the changes, for the most part, embraced, but feedback from individual participants was encouragingly positive.",e3407d61-82dc-414f-abd3-77905faa4a5c
42,discussion15," While not part of the study design, at the end of the study and 3 months later, informal feedback was gathered from the participants. The information provided indicated that participants were heartened by their weight loss and the majority continued with the new diet. Study participants also reported improvements in overall energy and well-being, as well as positive effects on a range of other factors, including serum cholesterol, arthritic pain, and nocturia. Formal collection and evaluation of such data in future studies would contribute to strategies for supporting dietary change in men with prostate cancer.  The ethnic homogeneity of the group in the current study meant that the influence of variances in genetic expression was reduced. However, a number of other confounders, including genetic influences, were not controlled for as this would have rendered the group too small for meaningful analysis.",188b2a71-e945-49dc-bbbb-d0b1616cd20d
43,discussion16," The authors recognise the importance of gene-diet interactions and acknowledge that any testing related to genetic expression requires a larger study to demonstrate relevance. Despite the fact that this was a small feasibility study, positive outcomes were noted within a short time frame. In order to apply the findings to a general population, it is necessary to confirm the results with a larger cohort. Such a study would allow stratification to control for a variety of confounding factors, such asadiposity, baseline dietary patterns, co-morbidities and lifestyle habits. The inclusion of a control group of men without prostate cancer would also be advantageous.  Conclusions We demonstrated that dietary change towards a Mediterranean-style pattern is both achievable and beneficial for men with prostate cancer in New Zealand, albeit in a small and motivated group.",9c4cf0e4-69e5-4968-8d37-0c4cca499791
44,discussion17," While there have been numerous studies evaluating the impact of a Mediterranean diet on clinical indicators of disease (Giovannelli et al., 2002; Menendez & Lupu, 2006; Fernández-Real et al., 2012; Kontogianni et al., 2012; Marlow et al., 2013; Mitjavila et al., 2013; Viscogliosi et al., 2013; Ellett et al., 2013) including prostate cancer (Ferrís-Tortajada et al., 2012; Kenfield et al., 2014), we believe this is the first time such a study has been conducted in regards to prostate cancer in New Zealand. This pilotstudy shows that a holistic approach to diet may contribute to modulation of DNA damage in spite of low baseline levels of inflammation. This is quite possibly due to an undeterminable synergistic effect of dietary components and associated phytonutrients.  Reduction in DNA damage was significantly associated with overall conformity to the general dietary pattern as well as intake of green tea, legumes, dietary vitamin C and folate.",53401df0-442d-4f12-ad45-388cfdb0195e
45,discussion18," While no effect on inflammatory markers was demonstrated, baseline inflammation in this small cohort was low. Nonetheless, the results obtained add weight to the notion that a low-inflammatory, high antioxidant diet may be of benefit for men with prostate cancer.  Certain aspects of the diet were more acceptable to participants than others. An exploration of the challenges faced in integration of specific dietary components would inform strategies to encourage ongoing compliance, and ultimately, long-term benefit for men with prostate cancer, including those with more advanced disease.
