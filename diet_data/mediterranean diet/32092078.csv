0,methods0,"We have selected the most recent literature on CD, viral infections, and diet with 37/49 references from the last 10 years and 26/49 from the last 4 years.  5. Conclusions The observations discussed in this commentary could have an important impact on the understanding of CD pathogenesis and also on clinical practice. The protective role of anti-rotavirus vaccination has still to be completely established, but at least theoretically the vaccine could prevent or delay the onset of the disease in children at risk [11]. It could be even reasonable to reduce the inflammatory insults during enterovirus infections by introducing a gluten-free diet for preventive purposes in subjects at genetic risk for CD. An important clinical practice to be implemented should be the introduction of the MD very early in life, at weaning, as a general way to prevent inflammation and dysbiosis.
