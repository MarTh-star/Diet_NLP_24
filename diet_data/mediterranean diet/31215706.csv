0,background0,"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are leading causes of death globally due, to a large extent, to unhealthy lifestyle choices of the last century [1].  In 2015, seven of the ten leading causes of death in Israel were NCDs [2]. Contrary to recommendations, an estimated 19.7% of the adult population smoked, 53.5% were overweight or obese, only 18.9% consumed at least five servings of vegetables and fruits per day, and only 35.2% routinely fulfilled physical activity recommendations [3].  More than 40% of chronic conditions could be avoided through the adoption of healthy lifestyle recommendations, according to Mokdad et al. [4], with data from the Nurses’ Health Study (1980–2014; n = 78,865) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986–2014, n = 44,354) suggesting that healthy lifestyles could substantially reduce premature mortality in U.S. adults. This would require healthier lifestyle habits such as not smoking, maintaining a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) of 18.5 to 24.",2f554de5-280d-4965-ab24-24ba8b1e7eac

Physicians have the ability to influence patients’ lifestyle behaviors [6–8]. In a randomized controlled trial in four community-based group family medicine clinics in southeastern Missouri (adult patients, − N = 915), a physician’s advice was a catalyst for changes made by patients, such as quitting smoking, eating less fat, or getting more exercise, prior to receiving intervention materials on the same topic [8].  Nevertheless, most physicians do not routinely advise on lifestyle behavior changes during medical clinic visits [6, 9–11]. Healthy Israel 2020 places primary care physicians at the forefront of health promotion and preventive medicine [12]. This can be achieved by incorporating Lifestyle Medicine (LM) as part of routine clinical work and medical education programs [13, 14].",742e772b-4f7e-4e23-9369-03b9987c3639
2,background2,"  Physicians’ personal health behaviors are also related to patients’ health behaviors [15, 16]. Counseling by a physician is strongly and consistently related to the physician’s own health practices, so addressing those practices is key to increasing health promotion counseling in practice. Patients also find physicians who briefly relate that they have such healthier habits more credible and more motivating [17].  In 2015, the World Medical Association recommended [18] that national medical associations “should recognize the strong and consistent link between physicians’ and patients’ personal health practices, providing yet another critically important reason for health systems to promote physician health” and that physicians’ “workplaces should promote conditions conducive to healthy lifestyles, including access to healthy food choices, exercise, nutrition counseling and support for smoking cessation.",ad4d56dc-69c0-45a4-b1bf-0ea7fd18aeda
3,background3,"”  A scientific statement from the American Heart Association published in 2016 recommended that all primary care residencies would benefit from incorporating lifestyle modules into their training programs [19]. The American College of Lifestyle Medicine recently launched a LM Residency Curriculum, starting its beta version application in July 2018 at four selected pilot sites [20].  The Israeli syllabus [21] for LM was developed in 2014. Since then, the Israeli Society of Lifestyle Medicine has promoted LM syllabus-based teaching in Israel. In Israel, there are five centers with Family Medicine (FM) residency programs delivering an academic diploma course of three to 4 years of weekly study days. Even though LM curricula are considered important and have been implemented in some of the FM residency programs in Israel, we know little about residents’ LM knowledge attitude nor their confidence in delivering LM counseling.",84098d3b-d840-4415-9d08-d1fe657c3cfc

All senior Israeli FM residents (those in their third or fourth years of a 4 year Israeli FM residency, n = 169) were included; these sites cover all geographic regions in Israel and include residents from all Israeli Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). LM training is usually delivered during the second year of residency or later.  Procedure A manual survey was provided by the researcher during one of the diploma course sessions for self-completion in one to three waves until all attended residents had completed the survey (May–June 2017). Residents were not required to provide any identifying information, and voluntary survey completion implied consent.",b6ef9c50-8cd2-4205-8af4-6b518695c50f
6,methods1,"  Survey Questions focused on participants’ self-reported attitudes and confidence about LM counseling, personal lifestyle behaviors, previous exposure to LM education, and LM knowledge assessment.  Knowledge assessment included ten questions either from FM board examinations (2010–2013) or from experts in each field. Missing answers were considered incorrect. Answering at least seven questions correctly was considered a passing level of knowledge. A score of 60% or less was considered failing the knowledge test.  Participants’ self-reported attitudes and confidence toward LM counseling was assessed by the Lifestyle Questionnaire. This validated questionnaire was developed to assess FM current status (internal reliability ɑ = 0.84) [22]; the questionnaire was used in a similar population in our previous study [23].",dd8ff5b4-37a7-4171-8fca-c36cc9cbdafe

Composite mean scores, a serial variable, were also measured for all attitude items combined and for all confidence items combined.  Lifestyle behaviors were assessed using the physician’s health questionnaire [24]. This questionnaire was developed to assess the health behavior of Israeli physicians and was subjected to internal validation by an expert panel and a convenience sample of 30 respondents.

In some sites, residents are exposed to limited LM topics. Residents may be exposed to LM materials in their HMO family department training opportunities. “Trained” residents were considered those who said they attended the LM-specific course or spent 20 h or more on LM learning.  Sociodemographic items were collected, including age, gender, country of birth, and country of graduation. A copy of the survey is available (in Hebrew) upon request from the authors.

19,discussion1,"  Trained residents had a higher level of LM knowledge and were more confident in their ability to succeed and impact a patient’s behavioral changes. However, in the multivariate linear regression models, participation in the LM training was not found to be a significant predictor of either the mean composite attitude or confidence score. Personal health behaviors (such as eating a Mediterranean diet) and completing medical school in Israel were found to be significant predictors of both the mean composite attitude and confidence scores.  Personal positive health behaviors were correlated with a higher level of confidence to provide patients with knowledge and skills to change their unhealthy lifestyles.  In a study of Ohio primary care residents, scores of attitude and self-efficacy regarding obesity, nutrition, and physical activity counseling were low [27]. Another study of U.S. residents (n = 101) areas found that only 19% felt competent in prescribing weight-loss programs [28].",9e7349df-20f6-43fd-88f1-e1ffb6dce41f

Yet, in the multivariate linear regression models, LM training was not found to be a significant predictor of high confidence level. Our previous study demonstrated that immediately after a LM course, trainings improve residents’ knowledge levels and confidence in delivering LM [23].  We are aware of the low number of trained residents passing the knowledge test and their therefore appropriately limited confidence in their ability to deliver LM interventions. This may mean that more in-depth training is needed to achieve better results. The challenge is to prioritize effective LM education as an essential part of FM residency.  The LM-positive attitude of Israeli FM residents is an important finding, since it implies that there is no need to convince them of the importance of LM.",11cbb4c5-d8e3-4cf6-a695-943e2eab03e1

FM residents see themselves as role models for their patients, and the high correlation we found between residents’ lifestyle behaviors and their perceived efficacy to impact patients demonstrates it. Prior studies have presented similar findings of a strong and consistent relationship between physicians’ and their patients’ health behaviors [15, 16, 18], and recommend investing in physicians’ health as an efficient and beneficent way to increase high-quality LM counseling and more distal patient outcomes [15, 16, 18, 30]. These findings that the residents’ personal health behaviours were correlated with their LM related attitudes and confidence, also support the need to invest in physicians’ personal health.

Second, the data collected were based on self-report, including self-reported lifestyle behaviors and residents’ recollections of the amount of LM training. This is similar to other studies in this field, but we cannot rule out reporting bias around attitudes and behaviors and an incorrect recollection of the amount of LM training. Third, this study did not track LM counseling in residents’ clinics with real patients.",cc12f82f-3032-4e42-8d62-2b9f9d7e287a
23,discussion5," After evaluating residents’ perceptions about LM counseling and the feasibility of LM training in Israel, our next step will be to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of LM training, with a personal health promotion component, on residents’ actual counseling skills and practices. This has been shown in one four-year-long medical school intervention to be effective [30–32], but never with residents or practicing physicians.  We are in the beginning of offering widely scaled LM education programs [33]; such can be found here at the LifestyleMedicineEducation.org/curricular resources/ website. It is clear that such offerings can help developing training programs for physicians in order to enhance the health of the population.
