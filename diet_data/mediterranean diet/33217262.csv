0,abstract0," Aberrant circulating omentin-1, which is an anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic adipokine, has been reported in various solid tumors. Therefore, we investigated whether circulating omentin-1 could be associated with postmenopausal BC (postmenopausal BC (PBC)) and could be used as a potential diagnostic and clinical tool taking into consideration clinicopathologic features, tumor markers, as well as anthropometric, metabolic, and inflammatory parameters. Serum omentin-1, tumor markers (CA15-3 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)); metabolic (insulin, glucose, HOMA index, and serum lipids), anthropometric (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and fat mass), and inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6, hsCRP) parameters; classic adipokines (leptin and adiponectin); the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) score; and cardiovascular (cardiovascular (CVD)) risk were determined in 103 postmenopausal women with pathologically confirmed incident invasive BC, 103 controls matched on age,",96f1813b-47ae-4e42-ba1e-95764c0fa240

The mean serum omentin-1 was significantly lower in cases than in controls and patients with benign breast lesions (BBL) (p < 0.001). In the patients, omentin-1 was inversely associated with tumor, metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers, cancer stage, and the number of infiltrated lymph nodes (p < 0.05). In all study participants, omentin-1 was negatively correlated with cardiovascular (CVD) risk and positively correlated with MedDiet score. Lower circulating omentin-1 was independently associated with postmenopausal BC (PBC) occurrence above and beyond known risk factors. According to the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the overall diagnostic performance of omentin-1 (0.84, 95% CI 0.79–0.89) is similar to CA15-3.",b4eb84fb-b279-40c1-97b5-d780fb387875

3,abstract3," Besides the well-established risk factors including age, genetic susceptibility, reproductive and hormonal factors, lifestyle and environmental determinants (sedentary life, alcohol consumption, diet, etc.), obesity, and metabolic syndrome (Mets) have also been associated with an increased risk of BC, particularly, postmenopausal BC (postmenopausal BC (PBC)) [5,6,7,8,9,10].  Indeed, BC, obesity, and Mets follow a parallel increasing trend globally, attributed mainly to an energy-dense diet and physical inactivity [8,9,10]. Excess body weight may be responsible for at least 7% of all postmenopausal BC (PBC) [1]. The overgrowth and dysfunctionality of the adipose tissue in obesity, particularly, visceral obesity, may lead to substantial alterations in its cellular composition, as well as in the dysregulation of adipocytokines that synergically promote chronic subclinical inflammation, insulin resistance, microenvironmental and cellular perturbations, and tumor transformation [4,7,11,12].",76b25e2c-740e-4311-9d86-28df73cb9277
4,abstract4," While classic adipocytokines, such as leptin and adiponectin, have been associated with BC in in vitro, animal and epidemiologic studies, little is known about novel adipocytokines [7,10,13,14].  Omentin, also known as intestinal lactoferrin receptor ITLN1 or intelectin-1, represents a novel hydrophilic 34 kDa adipocytokine of 313 amino acids, which is expressed mostly by visceral fat and exhibit pleiotropic inflammatory, metabolic, and immune-related actions [15,16]. Omentin-1 is the predominant abundant circulating isoform in the plasma, presenting 83% amino acid identity with omentin-2 and it is encoded by a gene in the 1q21.3 chromosomal region, which is associated with diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) in many subjects [17,18,19]. Paradoxically, although omentin-1 is mainly secreted by the visceral adipose tissue, circulating levels of omentin-1 are downregulated in obesity-associated metabolic disorders, i.e.",461c2831-de86-482d-8a80-71d59c43c584

The postmenopausal healthy control group (median age 61, range 49–85 years), the group of patients with benign breast lesions (BBL) (median age: 60, range 50–85 years), and the group of subjects with obesity (median age 61, range 49–84 years) were randomly selected from the outpatient clinics of the internal medicine and the laboratory departments of the same hospitals among women who were submitted to an annual check-up examination and presented a negative mammogram result indicating absence of BC. These participants were included if they had never been diagnosed with any form of cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer).",1d69896c-2eb5-4724-8608-96127286faa5
10,methods2," In particular, for every eligible case, an attempt was made to randomly identify a healthy control participant from the outpatient department matched to cases on age (±5 years) and as closely as possible in time to the diagnosis and sampling of the corresponding case (±1 month). Moreover, based upon the mammogram and cytopathology reports, a group of 51 women with benign breast lesions (BBL) and a group of women with obesity of similar age were also selected in order to evaluate the possible effects of benign breast lesions (BBL) and obesity on omentin-1.  All study participants did not present any infection at the time of enrolment in the study. Other exclusion criteria included endocrine disorders, DM, cardiovascular (CVD), renal disease, malignancy, liver disease, autoimmune disorder, muscular, neurologic, or psychiatric disorders and routine intake of any drugs including drugs for hyperlipidemia and thyroid disorders.",d2f53be3-3155-4ac5-83d4-2eb2cc39fe7f

Postmenopausal women with follicle-stimulating hormone (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)) above 40 IU/L were included in the study. The mean time since menopause was similar across groups. All study participants provided a written informed consent. The study protocol was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1964 and successive revisions, and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of both hospitals (NIMTS #1, 10 June 2009 and Attikon #7, 14 April 2014). The present study followed the STROBE guidelines for observational cross-sectional studies (Supplementary Materials).  2.2.

Family history of cancer, including BC was collected for first-degree relatives (parents and siblings) and for second-degree relatives (grandparents, uncles, and aunts). Medical records with cytopathology reports including stage, grade, size, lymph node involvement, and hormone receptor status were recorded. The same physicians performed weight, height, waist circumference (W.C.), and blood pressure (B.P.) measurements under similar conditions at the same time in the morning (8–9.30 am).",b0b3b776-28ea-474b-b196-16e5d589e1d6
13,methods5," Moreover, the aforementioned determinations were obtained at the time of diagnosis for cases with BC and benign breast lesions (BBL), and at the time of the enrolment in the study for control and obese participants. There were no missing data.  body mass index (BMI) was determined based on the formula: body weight (kg)/height2 (m2). Body fat percentage and fat mass were determined based on the Deurenberg equation [28]. Two BP determinations with the same instrument were performed 5 min apart after 10 min of rest for each participant. BP was calculated by taking into consideration the average of 2 determinations. The Framingham risk score algorithm was used to assess the 10-year general cardiovascular (cardiovascular (CVD)) risk of subjects [29]. Mets was defined according to the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program (National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)) Adult Treatment Panel (Adult Treatment Panel (ATP)) III [30].",d3910cf2-87a1-4b78-ba4b-383a93925f85
14,methods6," Women presenting three disorders were considered to be low-grade Mets and women presenting more than three disorders (four or five) were considered as high-grade Mets [31,32]. A validated 11-item questionnaire, the MedDietScore, was used to evaluate the adherence to the MedDiet [33,34,35]. This score (from 0 to 55) shows the level of adherence to the MedDiet; a score from 0 to 20 is considered to be low adherence, a score of 21 to 35 is considered to be medium adherence, while a score of 36–55 is considered to be high adherence [33].  2.3. Laboratory Determinations  The blood collection was performed under similar conditions early in the morning, after 12 h of fasting, and prior to the initiation of any therapeutic approach for the cases. The peripheral blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min in the laboratory. Serum was separated and stored at –80 °C until analysis of adipokine levels, as well as metabolic and tumor biomarkers.",15d80029-c0d4-443d-9ecd-c00b87da412f

Statistical Analysis  The statistical analysis was performed using the IBM® SPSS® version 25 for Windows. Categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages, while continuous variables were presented as a mean ± standard deviation. Data were evaluated through simple cross-tabulations and by using a chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, a t-test for normally distributed variables, and the Mann–Whitney U test for not normally distributed variables.

17,methods9," A one-way analysis of variance (A one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) for normally distributed variables or the Kruskal–Wallis test for not normally distributed variables were used for between group comparisons in the cases of more than two groups of continuous variables. The Spearman correlation coefficient (r) and partial correlations were used as the measurements of correlation for continuous or ordinal variables. Statistically significant predictors of circulating omentin-1 (dependent variable) found in univariate linear regression models were introduced in a multiple stepwise linear regression analysis, which was used to identify, in the final model only, significant independent variables affecting circulating omentin-1 (stepwise criteria of entry in the model ≤0.05 and removal from the model ≥0.1) [43].",8e44c718-8120-489c-a287-bbba4b3eff93

Unconditional logistic regression can be used without loss of validity, if the matching factors (age in our study) are accounted for [43]. Skewed continuous variables were logarithmically transformed in the models. A receiver operator characteristic (receiver operator characteristic (ROC)) curve analysis and calculation of the area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) were carried out in order to evaluate the ability of serum omentin-1 to correctly distinguish between patients with postmenopausal BC (PBC) and controls, patients with benign breast lesions (BBL), and subjects with obesity.",69843bee-a457-42d1-a3f5-110ad33d8ebc

Similar findings for lower omentin-1 levels have also been reported in other malignancies including renal cell cancer [45]. Nevertheless, another study of modest sample size (N = 72 postmenopausal women with treatment-naïve BC) has shown increased serum omentin-1 in treatment-naïve BC patients as compared with healthy controls in unadjusted analyses [24].",78897c94-994f-4d11-9fa1-dd917998d799
32,methods24,"  A considerable percentage of BC in postmenopausal women is due to obesity due to subclinical chronic inflammation and alterations in hormonal systems, including sex steroid hormones as well as peptide metabolic hormones, such as insulin, bioavailable insulin growth factor (insulin growth factor (IFG))-1, and adipokines [1,46]. Furthermore, excess visceral adiposity, which is an important source of free fatty acids, proinflammatory cytokines, and adipokines, is independently linked to all criteria constituting Mets as well as BC and cardiovascular (CVD) risks [31,47,48,49]. Interestingly, omentin-1 is synthesized in the visceral fat, particularly in stromal-vascular cells, and is downregulated in obesity following the same pattern as the anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic adipokine adiponectin [50]. Decreased levels of omentin-1 could be a marker of abdominal fat accumulation with an increased risk of BC and cardiovascular (CVD) [11,18,19,21,51].",9aa1a41c-084c-4e33-a86c-50f2bd4bdad3
33,methods25," Although, the precise pathophysiologic functions of omentin-1 via its unknown cellular receptor have not been elucidated so far, potentially plausible networks underlying the association of lower omentin-1 with postmenopausal BC (PBC) risk may include the following (Figure 4): Omentin-1 exhibits pro-apoptotic actions in cancer cells (HepG2 and HuH-7 cells) as observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) via the activation of the JNK/p53/bcl-2/caspase-3 signaling pathway and the increase and stabilization of p21 and p53 proteins, the latter being a tumor suppressor protein [52]. In vitro studies have also shown that omentin-1 diminished the viability of prostate tumor cells, while knocking down omentin-1 augmented the proliferation of these cells [53].  Omentin-1 presents tumor-suppressive, anti-proliferative, anti-invasive, and anti-metastatic potential.",765ea4ac-9450-401c-ad3d-8927a8ced50f
34,methods26," In gastric cancer cells, omentin-1 had a negative association with Ki67, an index of cell proliferation, and markers related to invasion and metastasis such as heparanase [54], while it inhibited the progression and metastasis of gastric cancer cells in vivo and in vitro [55]. Similar to our findings in BC, omentin-1 has been found to be inversely associated with tumor stage and lymph node infiltration in gastric cancer patients [54]. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that omentin-1 may attenuate the aggressiveness of gastric cancer cells (invasion and metastasis) via suppression of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/Nuclear factor-κΒ (NF-κB) signaling pathway [55].",eb40b185-d210-4cf6-adbc-15ad7d06e271
35,methods27," Interestingly, omentin-1 may influence the growth and aggressiveness of neuroblastoma cells through the upregulation of the N-myc downstream regulated gene 2, which attenuates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) [56].  Omentin-1 has been reported to show anti-inflammatory properties via downregulation of the NF-κΒ signaling pathway, antagonism with the Toll-like receptor-4, and decreased expression of chemokines and cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, etc.), and adhesion molecules [18]. This is in line with our study findings regarding the inverse relationship of omentin-1 with inflammatory biomarkers such as hsCRP, TNF-α, and IL-6.  Omentin-1 exhibits antioxidant potential through the suppression of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) and oxidized LDL synthesis, and the protection of mitochondrial function [18,57].",3fc3cf41-d247-43bf-ac54-74be228c78ae
36,methods28,"  Finally, omentin-1 exerts beneficial metabolic properties through the enhancement of insulin’ s actions by activating glucose uptake in subcutaneous and omental fat cells [15], as well as through the prevention of glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction via the stimulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) pathway [58].  In contrast to cancers presenting with low levels of omentin-1, recent evidence has shown elevated circulating omentin-1 in patients with colorectal, prostate, gastric, and pancreatic cancers [22,54,59,60,61]. This discrepancy may be due, among others, to the different cancer types and locations, the study population, the study design (prospective versus retrospective), the sample size, or the presence of cachexia at an advanced cancer stage, a complex metabolic state characterized by adipose and muscle loss [8,61,62]. Indeed, in our study, higher levels of omentin-1 were observed at stage IV.",621f5c6f-d8ba-495e-840e-6b59aee779d2
37,methods29," More and larger studies are needed to explore circulating omentin-1 across BC stages and its significance.  In addition to BC risk, omentin-1 may function as a biomarker of cardiovascular (CVD) risk in postmenopausal women [4,14,63]. In agreement with a bulk of previous studies analyzing the associations of omentin-1 with cardiometabolic risk factors, we have found negative associations with anthropometric variables, such as body mass index (BMI), WC, and fat mass; inflammatory biomarkers, such as hsCRP, TNF-α, and IL-6; metabolic and lipid markers, such as glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides; and blood pressure parameters, as well as positive associations with cardioprotective and anti-atherosclerotic markers such as HDL-C and adiponectin [19,20,45]. The dyad of adiponectin and omentin-1 are considered to be cardioprotective with beneficial actions in insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism via the increase of AMPK phosphorylation [63,64,65].",73115a7e-b4ca-45fc-b52e-dc312a1a8413
38,methods30," However, it is still unclear whether the regulation of omentin-1 could rely on adiponectin or the opposite effect [20]. In line with previous reported associations, circulating omentin-1 was linked to the presence of Mets and its severity, which is related to an increased occurrence of BC in postmenopausal women [31,66,67].  The findings of our study may present practical and clinical value as omentin-1 could be used as a non-invasive screening and clinical tool of BC in postmenopausal women as well as a preventive and therapeutic target. Low circulating omentin-1 may signal lymph node invasion, negative hormonal receptor status, and increased cardiometabolic risk [25,26,27,63]. More importantly, from a preventive perspective, circulating omentin-1 may increase through weight loss, physical exercise, and the adoption of a healthy diet such as the MedDiet which was found to be a positive predictor of serum omentin-1 in line with another study [68,69].",e7dac691-d4ce-4881-80dd-5468555c64a8
39,methods31," All three interventions, particularly the adoption of the MedDiet, are beneficial in the prevention of postmenopausal BC (PBC), Mets, obesity, and cardiovascular (CVD) [7,70,71,72]. The majority of individuals presenting Mets are unaware of their condition and its repercussions [73]. Because of its beneficial metabolic, anti-inflammatory, anti-neoplastic, cardioprotective, and anti-atherogenic properties, omentin-1 could be a promising therapeutic target. Antidiabetic agents, such as metformin, PPAR-γ agonists (pioglitazone), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (exenatide), and antilipidemic drugs such as atorvastatin may increase circulating omentin-1 [18]. Interestingly, the administration of omentin-1 delayed the development of atherosclerotic lesions in Apoe(−/−) mice [74].",be076bd9-9fd1-4320-9e98-e64443aff8d1
40,methods32,"  The strengths of the study include its novelty; the considerable number of clinical and laboratory data; the blind determination of parameters by the laboratory staff; the use of a highly specific ELISA kit for omentin-1 determination; and the enrolment of four groups (newly diagnosed treatment-naïve patients, healthy control participants, cases with benign breast lesions (BBL), and obese postmenopausal women) of similar age. The limitations of our study include: (1) its cross-sectional nature which cannot demonstrate causality, but could unravel hypotheses to be examined in future large, prospective, and multicentric studies; (2) its modest sample size of cases and controls to enable reliable estimates of joint effects, to identify effect modifiers, and to conduct multivariate subgroup analyses; (3) its small sample size of postmenopausal women with benign breast lesions (BBL) and obesity; (4) its dependence on a single blood sample from study participants,",5b7c8240-1ed9-4bc2-a6f1-41f7770ea47d
41,methods33," although there are no significant issues regarding reproducibility and reliability in omentin-1 determinations over a chronic time period [75]; (5) the potential of residual confounding by other undetermined variables, which always exist as a possibility in all studies; (6) the non-use of the standard methods of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) to quantify abdominal adipose tissue in study participants. Due to ionizing radiation risks, it is not appropriate to determine abdominal fat with CT in many research and clinical studies. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is low risk, it needs specialized resources that are expensive for determining fat distribution alone. Finally, we did not study the expression level of the omentin-1 gene in adipose tissue or cancerous tissue in study participants.  5.",bf753876-90b3-47d0-8929-c164b7b8e011
42,methods34," Conclusions  In conclusion, in this cross-sectional study of modest sample size, we provided evidence for an independent negative association between circulating omentin-1 and postmenopausal BC (PBC) above and beyond known BC risk factors, as well as metabolic and inflammatory parameters. Circulating omentin-1 was negatively associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and positively associated with the MedDiet. Its circulating levels may be modulated by the adoption of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant MedDiet; however, more, larger studies are needed to confirm this finding. Moreover, circulating omentin-1 as a biomarker presented a similar diagnostic performance to that of tumor biomarker CA15-3 in BC with a poorer discriminative ability in postmenopausal women with obesity.",74f61135-aa2b-4ba1-be1c-3ac4f8e658f0
43,methods35," More mechanistic and larger well-designed, multicentric, prospective, and longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the ontological role of omentin-1 in breast tumorigenesis and cardiovascular (CVD), its screening and prognostic utility as a non-invasive biomarker, and its therapeutic potential.
