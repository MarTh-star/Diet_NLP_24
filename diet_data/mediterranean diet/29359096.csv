0,introduction0,"Colorectal cancer (colorectal cancer (CRC)) remains one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies worldwide with 1.8 million new cases estimated in 2018 (1). Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence greatly diverge among different geographic areas reaching the highest rate of incidence in developed countries where a high-fat western dietary pattern is largely adopted (2). In particular, the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rates are found in Australia/New Zealand, Northern America, Eastern Asia and some parts of Europe (e.g., Hungary and Norway) (1).  A clear relationship between long-term unhealthy dietary habits and increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) is widely recognized (3), while prudent dietary patterns have been associated to colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention (4).",c65d4034-93f0-49bc-bd1a-bce160077259
1,introduction1," Among healthy dietary patterns, a pescovegetarian diet has been correlated with an overall lower colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence highlighting the importance of fruits, vegetables, cereals, and fish consumption for colorectal cancer (CRC) risk reduction (5). Moreover, it is known that Mediterranean Diet (MD), which is characterized by a daily consumption of whole grains, legumes, nuts, olive oil, fish, fruits, and vegetables protects against colonic adenoma recurrence and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in different cohort studies (6–8). Importantly, data obtained from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)) study involving 10 European countries and about 520,000 healthy subjects (aged 25–70 years) showed that adherence to Mediterranean Diet was associated with a reduction of colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (8–11%) (9).",86719fe2-ce17-4bd4-94c3-c7f36c658cab
2,introduction2," The preventive effects of these prudent dietary patterns on colorectal cancer (CRC) are mainly associated with the high content of polyphenols and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3-PUFAs) (10–12). Some of the phenolic compounds commonly found in the MD are: catechins (from apples and walnuts), ferulic acid (from whole grain), naringenin (from tomatoes), and hydroxytyrosol (from olive oil) (13). We previously demonstrated that polyphenols extracted from annurca apple as well as the ω-3-PUFA Eicosapentaenoic acid as free fatty acid (EPA-FFA) were able to exert chemopreventive properties in the ApcMin/+ mouse model of familial adenomatous polyposis (14, 15). Also, the anticancer effect of walnut consumption have been recently demonstrated in the Azoxymethane (azoxymethane (AOM)) mouse model of colorectal cancer (CRC) (16).",1d523c56-a68a-41e4-bf11-d5d0c598b753
3,introduction3,"  There is mounting evidence that the gut microbiota composition is critically influenced by dietary habits and that an imbalance in the relative abundance of specific bacterial strains may have a pivotal role in colorectal cancer (CRC) initiation and progression (17). Recently, the impact of MD on the gut microbiota structure has been investigated in humans demonstrating that the beneficial effects associated with MD may be driven by changes in the gut microbiota composition (18, 19).  Although the anticarcinogenic properties of single food-derived compounds have been evaluated in colorectal cancer (CRC) (20), the combined effect of food bioactives, typically consumed in the MD regimen, has not been investigated so far.",4f685b56-4479-45cb-a1c9-a89689a3d345
4,introduction4,"  In this study, we hypothesized that extracts from MD components in combination with the fish-derived EPA-FFA (referred as MD-MIX) may be able to counteract the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) in azoxymethane (AOM)-treated mice undergoing different dietary protocols. We found that the MD-MIX prevented the development of colonic malignant lesions mainly acting on apoptosis in mice fed a low-fat diet (low fat (LFD)) or modulating the gut microbiota structure in mice fed a high-fat western diet (high fat western diet (HFWD)).

5,methods0,"Mediterranean Diet Mix Composition The Mediterranean Diet Mix (MD-MIX) was obtained by combining the ω-3 PUFA EPA-FFA (provided in the diet as outlined in the next paragraph) and a mix of bioactive phytochemicals extracts resembling the main categories constituting the Mediterranean diet and contributing to the total phytochemicals intake (Annurca apples 25%, cherry tomatoes 25%, walnuts 15%, wholegrain wheat 15%, and olive oil 20%). Phytochemicals sources and quantity were selected in order to have a good balance of the different families of polyphenols (flavanols, anthocyanins, ellagitannins, secoiridoids).  The polyphenol profile of the mix of extracts was characterized (see Supplementary Methods) and its concentration was expressed as equivalents of the most represented polyphenols: catechins (from apples and walnuts), ferulic acid (from wholegrain wheat), naringenin (from tomatoes), and hydroxytyrosol (from olive oil) (Supplementary Table 1).",5baab93c-f5d8-406a-a4ad-584e16543c10

The number of mice “n” in each arm is shown.  Body weight was monitored weekly, while rectal bleeding and diarrhea daily. Nineteen weeks after the first azoxymethane (AOM) injection, mice were euthanized through isofluorane overdose followed by cardiac puncture. Urine was collected at sacrifice by bladder aspiration and stored at −80°C. The colon was immediately removed, opened longitudinally, washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, and its length was recorded.",e1300196-ee9f-4054-9118-155adfddd3ad
10,methods5," The number, location and size of macroscopical lesions was determined using a stereomicroscope and measured using a digital caliper. Fresh tissue samples from normal colonic mucosa (1 cm length) were collected from middle colon and stored at −80°C for molecular analyses or formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE)) for immunohistochemistry (immunohistochemistry (IHC)). Then, the remaining colon was fixed in Bouin solution and paraffin-embedded to be processed for histopathology (21).  Histopathology Histopathological evaluation was performed by one expert blinded pathologist (TB) on multiple hematoxylin and eosin stained sections obtained from the whole colon of each mouse. Dysplastic areas were classified as low-grade dysplasia (low grade dysplasia (LGD)), high-grade dysplasia (high grade dysplasia (HGD)), or adenocarcinoma (AdenoK).",28b154b7-6171-4578-b30a-c4336672f83c
11,methods6,"  Mucosal Fatty Acid Analysis Mucosal fatty acid content was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on fresh tissue samples as previously described (22).  Determination of Urinary Polyphenols Polyphenols were extracted from urine samples as previously reported (23) with minor modifications (see Supplementary Methods). The molecular formula and the selected ion for quantified polyphenols are reported in Supplementary Table 3.  Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL Assay For immunohistochemistry (IHC), formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) colonic tissues were sectioned at 4 μm thickness and processed as previously reported, using Ki67 primary antibody (1:400 Cell Signaling Technology #9027). The percentage of Ki67+ cells was obtained dividing the number of positive nuclei on total nuclei on 15 colonic crypts (when possible longitudinal crypts were selected).",4bfaf22b-d734-4802-8a52-eb73d0fdb661

For quantitative analysis of TUNEL, ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), coupled with the Color Deconvolution plug-in, was used to quantify the percentage of positively stained nuclear area as previously (24).  RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-Time PCR Total RNA was extracted from fresh normal colonic tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen™, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNA concentration was measured using the Nanodrop 1,000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, total RNA was reverse transcribed using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA™ Kit (Applied Biosystems™, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions.",12cfc73b-45e8-4e08-9c98-72787d710f34

Gapdh was used as reference gene for mRNA normalization. Fold induction levels were obtained using the 2−ΔΔCt method by normalizing against the reference gene. Data were plotted as Bax/Bcl2 ratio.  Microbiota Analysis and Bioinformatics For microbiota analysis fecal samples were collected from mice at different time points: 9 (T1: 1 week after the beginning of the feeding protocol), 17 (T2: 1 week after the first azoxymethane (AOM) injection), and 35 (T3: at the sacrifice) weeks of age. Feces from mice grouped in the same cage were pooled at each time point and total bacterial DNA was extracted using the QIAmp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).",80c59661-df2f-42c3-af6e-de9b8012fc27
14,methods9," Microbiota data were obtained by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene by using an Illumina platform. For each sample, the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified using primers carrying Illumina overhang adapter sequences (25). Amplicons were purified with a magnetic bead-based clean-up system (Agencourt AMPure XP; Beckman Coulter, CA). Indexed libraries were prepared by limited-cycle PCR using Nextera technology and cleaned up with AMPure XP magnetic beads. Libraries were pooled at equimolar concentrations (4 nM), denatured and diluted to 6 pM before loading onto the MiSeq flow cell. A 2 × 300 bp paired end protocol was used, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Raw sequences were processed using a pipeline combining PANDAseq and QIIME (26, 27).",a577ecd3-3144-4bd2-a671-d3f272dfc8bc

Taxonomy was assigned using the RDP classifier against Greengenes database (May 2013 release). The percentages of OTUs assigned to the different bacterial phylogenetic groups (from genus to phylum) were calculated as relative abundances for all samples. Average abundances were calculated for each time point and for all diet combinations. Values for bacterial genera present at a relative abundance >0.05% in at least one sample were used to produce a heatmap with horizontal scaling, plotting the z score (i.e., number of standard deviations from the mean, from −3 to 3) for each time point.

The MD-MIX supplementation was able to reduce the number of colonic lesions in both low fat (LFD) and high fat western diet (HFWD)-fed mice and to induce apoptosis, in particular in the low fat (LFD)-MD-MIX arm. Moreover, a preventive effect on low-grade dysplasia and macroscopical lesions (>1 mm) development was found in high fat western diet (HFWD)-fed mice together with a regulation of the azoxymethane (AOM)-driven intestinal dysbiosis.  Conclusions: MD-MIX was able to counteract colorectal cancer (CRC) development in mice under different dietary backgrounds through the regulation of apoptosis and gut microbiota.  colorectal cancerchemopreventionmicrobiotaMediterranean dietomega-3Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro10.",ca73ffe4-2fb2-4912-8a80-07f3166533eb

The A/J strain was chosen given its high sensitivity to azoxymethane (AOM)-driven colon carcinogenesis (29). Tumor incidence was 100% in azoxymethane (AOM)-exposed mice, while no tumors were observed in both low fat (LFD) and high fat western diet (HFWD) healthy mice indicating that high fat western diet (HFWD) alone is not sufficient to induce tumor development during a lifespan of 27 weeks.

19,results2," Importantly, MD-MIX feeding significantly reduced tumor multiplicity in the low fat (LFD)-MD-MIX group respect to the low fat (LFD) arm and also protected against colonic lesions development in high fat western diet (HFWD)-fed mice (Figure 2B). Noteworthy, high fat western diet (HFWD) group showed a significant higher number of lesions compared to low fat (LFD)-MD-MIX arm (Figure 2B). Analyzing the effect of the diet (low fat (LFD) or high fat western diet (HFWD)) or MIX on the number of lesions, we found that the MIX significantly affects the number of lesions in mice fed both diets with no interaction between diet and MIX. Regarding lesion size, high fat western diet (HFWD) arm displayed a significant higher number of lesions larger than 1 mm compared to low fat (LFD) and low fat (LFD)-MD-MIX arms (Figure 2C).",473e1ac7-c345-4b74-a596-2efcc62b62b9
20,results3," Treatment with the MD-MIX in high fat western diet (HFWD)-fed mice was associated with a significant lower number of lesions larger than 1 mm while no significant differences in terms of lesions smaller than 1 mm were observed among all groups (Figure 2C). Interestingly, histological analysis showed a higher number of low grade dysplasia (LGD) lesions in the high fat western diet (HFWD) arm, which was partially counteracted by the MD-MIX (Figure 2D).

Effect of Dietary Protocols on Body Weight, Colonic EPA Incorporation and Urinary Polyphenol Content We did not observe a significant weight increase in mice fed a high fat western diet (HFWD) compared with low fat (LFD)-fed mice (Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover, azoxymethane (AOM) exposition was associated with a significant weight reduction in all treated mice independently from the diet (Supplementary Figure 2).

Unexpectedly, high fat western diet (HFWD), but not low fat (LFD) feeding, was associated with an increased urinary polyphenol content which is detectable both in healthy and azoxymethane (AOM)-treated mice. Moreover, MD-MIX exposure led to a further increase in urinary polyphenol concentration in high fat western diet (HFWD) mice, but not in low fat (LFD) arm (Supplementary Table 4).  These results indicate that EPA was efficiently incorporated in colonic epithelial membranes upon EPA-FFA supplementation in particular in low fat (LFD)-fed mice and that urinary polyphenols excretion was increased under high fat western diet (HFWD) regimen.

Effect of azoxymethane (AOM) and MD-MIX on Gut Microbiota Structure The pivotal role of the diet and colon carcinogenesis in modulating the gut microbiota composition has been described (31, 32). Thus, we evaluated whether azoxymethane (AOM) treatment under different dietary regimens may induce changes in specific bacterial populations. The 16S rRNA amplicons obtained from DNA samples extracted from pooled mice feces were sequenced, resulting in 226,372 high quality sequences, ranging between 2,166 and 5,802 with an average value of 4,527 sequences per sample.

In particular, our results showed that dietary supplementation with the MD-MIX may provide protection against early carcinogenic events, also in mice exposed to high fat western diet (HFWD).  The impact of dietary habits on colorectal cancer (CRC) risk has been extensively investigated. In particular, there is a great interest in identifying an effective dietary regimen that could counteract the adverse events associated with long-term unhealthy dietary habits and the widespread development of obesity, including colorectal cancer (CRC).",085340e3-6849-41b7-ba5a-32dc9340470e
32,discussion1," However, many observational human studies conducted to evaluate how food habits may affect obesity and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk often suffer from confounding factors thus providing inconsistent results (32). The MD is recognized as a healthy dietary pattern. The effect of MD on colorectal cancer (CRC) risk has been extensively discussed in a recent review (8). Overall, a protective effect of MD pattern on colorectal cancer (CRC) risk has emerged from case-control studies and meta-analyses, although data obtained from cohort studies were less consistent. These discrepancies appeared to be mainly due to different factors including: indexes used to quantify the adherence to MD, age, sex, and tumor site. Importantly MD was found to be more protective against the development of distal colorectal cancer (CRC) in young adults, particularly inhabiting the MD geographic area (8).",221ef4e4-5672-4466-a5da-0bd64eeb48b6
33,discussion2,"  To the best of our knowledge this is the first study aiming to approximate a MD regimen in mice and to clarify its impact on colorectal cancer (CRC) onset. Despite being less obesity-prone compared to other mice strains (i.e., C57BL/6J), we opted to use the A/J strain for its increased susceptibility to azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon carcinogenesis (29). Indeed we obtained a 100% tumor incidence in azoxymethane (AOM)-treated mice, while no tumors were observed in healthy mice fed with high fat western diet (HFWD) alone. These results are consistent with previous literature data showing that a long-term exposure to high-fat diet is necessary to obtain colonic malignant lesions in the absence of a mutagenic agent (33).  Being chemoprevention the main objective of this study, all the analyses performed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms that precede cancer development in this setting, were conducted on non-neoplastic colonic mucosa.",f4c033aa-d20e-4e5f-8dfc-b75f85ffe103
34,discussion3,"  In order to evaluate EPA and polyphenols bioavailability, EPA incorporation in colonic tissues and urinary excretion of polyphenols were assessed. Data showed that mice treated with the MD-MIX efficiently incorporated EPA in colon tissues, independently from the diet, although low fat (LFD)-MD-MIX group showed a higher EPA percentage respect to high fat western diet (HFWD)-MD-MIX arm. Thus, it is possible that high fat western diet (HFWD), containing a higher percentage of linoleic acid compared with low fat (LFD) may result in a lower EPA incorporation. Importantly, we found a higher level of apoptosis in the MD-MIX treated mice, particularly in low fat (LFD)-MD-MIX. Different dietary components present in the MD extract have been associated with apoptosis induction (34). Among these, omega-3 are known to have pro-apoptotic properties in colorectal cancer (CRC) (15, 22, 35).",23b3765c-7f07-4a99-81c2-7eaf34408ddf
35,discussion4," In addition, we observed a higher polyphenol bioavailability in high fat western diet (HFWD) than low fat (LFD) arms exposed to the MD-MIX. Since it is known that insoluble dietary fibers can speed intestinal transit time and bind polyphenols in the intestine (36), we hypothesized that the higher content of cellulose in low fat (LFD) compared with high fat western diet (HFWD) might affect polyphenols absorption.  The role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) is widely demonstrated (37, 38), and it is known that dietary habits may cause relevant differences in the gut microbiota structure (39). Recently, the beneficial effect of the consumption of foods typical of a MD regimen on gut microbiota composition have been highlighted in an Italian (18) and a Spanish cohort (40).",e6198379-82d5-42c6-9762-7151ad0cdabe
36,discussion5,"  Interestingly, in our study, despite the chemopreventive effects of MD-MIX in both low fat (LFD) and high fat western diet (HFWD) arms, we observed that the MD-MIX effect in counteracting the azoxymethane (AOM)-associated gut microbiota dysbioses was strictly dietary dependent. This leads us to hypothesize that the impact of MD-MIX on the gut microbiota may act with distinct mechanisms based on dietary regimens, as previously suggested (41). Indeed, although azoxymethane (AOM) exposure led to a rapid increase in the relative abundance of Lactobacillaceae family in both low fat (LFD) and high fat western diet (HFWD) arms, MD-MIX was able to redress this dysbiotic drift only in mice fed high fat western diet (HFWD). The increase in Lactobacillaceae observed in azoxymethane (AOM)-treated mice happened concomitantly to a decrease in members of the Firmicutes phylum (mainly Oscillospira and Uncl_Clostridiales).",1f121199-7af2-42bb-ba94-c1f67708d6c0
37,discussion6," Importantly, high fat western diet (HFWD)-MD-MIX group showed Firmicutes profile similar to healthy high fat western diet (HFWD) mice with increased abundance of Oscillospira genus belonging to the Ruminococcaceae family. Recent findings in a Spanish cohort living in the Mediterranean area showed an inverse association among Oscillospira abundance with BMI and dietary intake of proteins and cholesterol indicating that changes in specific bacterial strains may reflect differences in nutrient consumption (40). Moreover, increased levels of Oscillospira have been also associated with MD consumption in non-human primates respect to Western-diet consumers (42).  An overgrowth of the Allobaculum genera, a member of Erysipelothricaceae, was found in high fat western diet (HFWD) arm at T3. A hyperproliferation of Allobaculum-like bacteria has been observed in fecal samples of rats treated with the carcinogen 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine which is a metabolic precursor of azoxymethane (AOM) (43).",e33d72a1-736b-4eec-ae0d-3097d7ba992f
38,discussion7," In addition, increased levels of Erysipelotrichaceae, in particular genera Allobaculum in mice fed a low-fat diet have been reported (41, 44), while controversial results regarding changes in members of Erysipelotrichi class of bacteria in mice undergoing a high-fat diet or western dietary pattern have been described (45, 46). As observed for Lactobacillus and Oscillospira, the high fat western diet (HFWD)-MD-MIX maintained a healthy-like abundance of Erysipelotrichi as well. Interestingly, in the context of the low fat (LFD) regimen, the MD-MIX treatment strengthens the increase in Erysipelotrichi, consolidating the dysbiotic potential of azoxymethane (AOM).  Our data indicate that the effects of MD-MIX on the azoxymethane (AOM)-driven gut microbiota dysbiosis are strictly dependent on the underlying dietary regimen.",499f2da4-72b6-4407-9e10-b7e075d20077
39,discussion8," Indeed, while MD-MIX keeps the gut microbiome ecosystem in an eubiotic configuration under high fat western diet (HFWD) exposure, it consolidates an azoxymethane (AOM) dependent dysbiotic gut microbiota signature in the low fat (LFD) fed groups.  In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that the supplementation with bioactives typical of MD could be effective as a chemopreventive approach in subjects who adhere to either a balanced or a western dietary regimens. Further clinical studies involving human subjects are warranted to clarify the role of MD on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention and to investigate the potential combined effect of dietary supplementation in association with a pharmacological strategy to obtain a stronger protection.
