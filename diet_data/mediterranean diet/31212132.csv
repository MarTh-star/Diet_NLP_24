0,introduction0,"The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is a dietary pattern characterized by high consumption of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and cereals, use of olive oil as the main culinary fat, moderate consumption of alcohol, and low consumption of red meat and dairy products . Observational studies show a positive association of the MedDiet with cognitive scores including general cognitive function, memory, and executive function (Wengreen et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2015; Hardman et al., 2016). However, randomized controlled trials reported no significant differences between the MedDiet group and the comparison group . A multimodal neuroimaging approach might provide clarification as to apparent unsuccessful translation from observational studies to clinical trials.",1ed9e25b-0dd8-465a-96e4-20db862fd31e
1,introduction1,"  Studies in older adults applying a multimodal neuroimaging approach and neuropsychological testing have shown that the MedDiet is associated with several brain correlates, such as global volumes and white matter integrity, but not always with cognitive performance. For instance, higher adherence to the MedDiet was associated with lower diffusivity values as measured by diffusion tension imaging, which, in turn, was linked to memory scores . Yet, no association was detected in other brain correlates reported to be related with cognitive decline such as the total volume of gray and white matter, or hyperintensities . In contrast, high adherence to the MedDiet was associated with larger gray matter volumes (GMVs) of the dentate gyrus, but not with hyperintensities .",cc31415a-e1ad-44cf-bc44-1cebca4a9c83
2,introduction2," Interestingly, in this case, high adherence to the MedDiet was also associated with higher learning and memory composite score, but the GMV of the dentate gyrus did not mediate the association between the MedDiet and cognition . These findings suggest that the MedDiet potentially exerts its effects through diverse mechanisms that can only be fully understood by resorting to a multimodal neuroimaging approach.  Even though several studies of the association of the MedDiet with cognition have been done regarding brain volumes and hyperintensities volumes, few studies have also focused on the white matter integrity  and none on the brain structural connectivity. An approach combining dietary assessment, neuropsychological evaluation, and several neuroimaging brain-based measures has the potential to provide complementary information in understanding the relationship between eating patterns, brain structure, and cognition.",12f78e88-479e-44c7-b358-e61b7bf2776a
3,introduction3," Here, the present work aims to address whether MRI-based measures differ among aging community-dweller older adults as a function of the MedDiet adherence. We hypothesized that high adherence to the MedDiet was associated with larger global brain volumes, preserved white matter integrity, and higher structural connectivity.

The primary exclusion criteria included inability to understand informed consent, participant choice to withdraw from the study, incapacity and/or inability to attend the clinical and neuropsychological assessment session(s), dementia, or diagnosed neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disorder (medical records). A team of clinicians performed a standardized clinical interview that included current medication and allowed to further detect and exclude disorders of the central nervous system (epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders) as well as overt thyroid pathology, and a team of psychologists carried out the neuropsychological assessment .",33553bb3-506e-4491-a97a-16a89ad14add
5,methods1," Of the original 1,051 participants, 246 individuals were randomly selected and contacted. Of these, 120 integrated the prospective cohort whose main aim was to study the healthy cognitive aging. From these, 86 individuals accepted to be reevaluated for follow-up. Of these, 77 performed the MRI acquisition protocol, but 1 was excluded due to missing data, which resulted in a total of 76 individuals (Figure 1). Clinical assessments took place at the Clinical Academic Center – Braga (2CA-B; Braga, Portugal). All participants provided informed consent to participate in the present study. The study was approved by the national and local ethics review boards and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  FIGURE 1 Sample size and timeline of procedures.  Dietary Assessment The dietary assessment was measured on an average of 18 months (range 16–25 months, 10.",ecfb7ead-2408-4015-9463-103838fc5697
6,methods2,"2% > 19 months) prior to the MRI scan, and neuropsychological assessment and consistency of the dietary pattern was confirmed by a non-significant paired t-test between the two moments. To ascertain the total energy intake, a 24-h dietary recall was applied, whereas the adherence to the MedDiet was measured through the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (MEDAS)). As for the 24-h recall, a manual adaptation of the Automated Multiple-Pass Method  was applied by an experienced dietician. After obtaining a list of all food items eaten on the previous day, the interviewer probed for frequently forgotten foods such as savory snacks or candies. Then, the time and name of the eating occasion (e.g., breakfast) and a detailed description of the type of food item, cooking method, and other relevant aspects were collected. At last, a final revision of the dietary intake took place .",4bf2d45d-e075-4bff-a5c4-50be45a13032
7,methods3," Once the data were collected, energy intake was determined by Nutrilog SAS software (version 3.1). For this analysis, a single 24-h recall was collected.  Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screening is a 14-item questionnaire (12 questions on food consumption frequency and 2 on food intake habits) aiming at measuring adherence to the MedDiet . Each question is scored according to the cutoff points of each item that better represented the observed dose–response relationships between the MedDiet and a statistically significant protection against myocardial infarction in a case-control study (Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2002). Thus, one point is assigned when one (1) uses olive oil as the principal source of fat for cooking, (2) prefers white over red meat, and (3) eats a dish with sauce of tomato, garlic, onion, or leeks sautéed in olive oil twice per week.",ab88fc6e-e4fd-4baa-9ee6-27c50ef8edd5
8,methods4," One point is also assigned when one consumes: (1) ≥4 tablespoons of olive oil/day; (2) ≥2 servings of vegetables/day; (3) ≥3 pieces of fruit/day; (4) <1 serving of red meat, hamburger, or sausages per day; (5) <1 serving of animal fat/day; (6) <1 cup of sugar-sweetened beverages/day; (7) ≥7 servings of wine/week; (8) ≥3 servings of pulses/week; (9) ≥3 servings of fish or seafood per week; (10) <2 commercial pastries/week; and (11) ≥3 servings of nuts/week. In case the conditions are not met, 0 points are recorded. The final score ranges between 0 and 14 points, and values equal to, or greater than, 10 ensure high adherence (Martínez-González et al., 2012). Whereas item 1 (use of olive oil as the principal source of fat for cooking) and item 2 (preference for white over red meat) measure food intake habits, all other items measure food consumption frequency.",99ec5316-b8a7-4368-b245-8b12253bdea1
9,methods5," Thus, adherence to the MedDiet was dichotomized as per the cutoff of 10, yielding two groups: high adherence to the MedDiet (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (MEDAS) ≥ 10) and low adherence to the MedDiet (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (MEDAS) < 10) (Martínez-González et al., 2012). Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (MEDAS) reliably ranks the MedDiet adherence  with a moderate correlation with dietary intake , corroborated with objective blood biomarkers .  Neuropsychological Assessment and Cognitive Scores Trained psychologists carried out the neuropsychological evaluation. The battery of tests was selected to assess specific cognitive profiles (general cognition, executive and memory functions). The mini-mental state examination (mini mental state examination (MMSE)) evaluated the global cognitive status (Folstein et al.",af6a454e-7635-4891-9a5b-6bdd729c3112
10,methods6,", 1975), the multiple trial verbal learning – the selective reminding test (selective reminding test (SRT)) assessed memory function ; and Stroop color and word test (Stroop color and word test (STROOP)) measured executive function with response inhibition/cognitive flexibility . Then, two latent variables were defined: executive function and memory. These two latent variables were previously validated through a confirmatory factor analysis, which found that a two-factor solution composed by a so-termed memory factor (MEM) and general and executive factor (general and executive factor (GENEXEC)) better represented the factor structure of the neuropsychological measures . Executive functioning included the mini mental state examination (MMSE) and Stroop color and word test (STROOP), whereas memory performance resorted to selective reminding test (SRT) . The final scores of each subtest, i.e.",bd786b16-60f9-473e-a81c-3b81a5abb346
11,methods7,", Stroop color and word test (STROOP) (words, colors, words/colors) and selective reminding test (SRT) (memory score long-term storage, consistent-term retrieval, and delayed recall), were transformed according to the proportion of maximum scaling, where each test score was subtracted from the minimum of the sample and divided by the difference between the maximum and the minimum .  Brain Measures MRI Data Acquisition The brain imaging sessions took place at the Hospital of Braga (Portugal) on a clinically approved Siemens Magnetom Avanto 1.5 T MRI scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany), using a 12-channel receive-only head coil. Two acquisitions comprising the imaging protocol were considered in this study: structural and diffusion-weighted imaging (diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)).",a971f2e2-badf-48e8-8437-9bda77dc3f39
12,methods8," For the structural acquisition, a 3D T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE)) sequence was used with the following parameters: 176 sagittal slices, TR/TE = 2,730/3.48 ms, flip angle = 7°, slice thickness = 1.0 mm, in-plane resolution = 1.0 × 1.0 mm2, FoV = 256 × 256 mm, slice gap = 0 mm. As for the diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) scan, a spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence was used with the following parameters: TR = 8,800 ms, TE = 99 ms, FoV = 240 × 240 mm, acquisition matrix = 120 × 120, 61 2-mm axial slices with no gap, 30 non-collinear gradient directions with b = 1,000 s/mm2, one b = 0 s/mm2 acquisition, and two as total number of repetitions.  Prior to data preprocessing, all acquisitions were visually inspected by the authors, including a certified neuroradiologist, to confirm that none of the participants had brain lesions nor critical head motion or artifacts that could compromise data quality.",c97b2fc2-8dfb-4bf1-8d75-a132dc2019bb

First, DICOM files were converted to NIfTI format, and each participant’s anatomical image was centered and then segmented into gray, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid using the SPM12 segmentation tool. Individual images were then coregistered between participants using Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL)).",9297039c-38b0-4447-8ea4-90933199d5a9

Total values of gray matter volume (Total values of gray matter volume (TGMV)), white matter (Total values of gray matter volume (TGMV) white matter (TWMV)), and cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) were obtained from the sum of the product of the voxel value and the voxel volume. Total intracranial volume (intracranial volume (ICV)) was obtained from the sum of the GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes.",1b0c5c46-3ac5-4154-979a-93425bccffac
15,methods11,"  White matter hypointensities volume White matter hypointensities (White matter hypointensities (WMH)) were estimated after white matter segmentation and white matter signal abnormalities (white matter signal abnormalities (WMSA)) volume estimation of structural images. Briefly, the standard semi-automated workflow implemented in Freesurfer toolkit version 5.12 comprises 31 processing steps, which include the spatial normalization to Talairach standard space, skull stripping, intensity normalization, tessellation of GM–WM boundary, and cortical, subcortical, and WM segmentation.

Covariates Age, sex, number of years of formal education, and data on lifestyle factors such as physical activity and smoking habits were also collected.",f5886ae6-7eaa-4239-b010-bc64ba28d8f7
19,methods15," The physical activity level was assessed through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire—Short form (IPAQ-SF) that assesses the types of the intensity of physical activity and sitting time over the previous 7 days. Estimates are given in MET-min/week and time spent sitting . As for the smoking habits, participants were categorized as non-smoker, former smoker, or current smoker. In addition, the mood and the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) were also assessed. Depressive mood status was ascertained by the Geriatric Depression Scale (Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)) . The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is a 30-item questionnaire, whose scores range from 0 to 30 representing the total of depressive symptoms. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated according to the standardized manual based on international recommendations (Stewart et al.",81a4a50b-b249-4b6c-aaa7-d7a5ce288534

Data Analysis Diffusion structural connectivity analyses resorted to a connectomics approach, and the networks were built using the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas. To estimate the structural connectivity based on the diffusion data, the probtrackx tool from the FMRIB’s Diffusion Toolbox (FDT) toolbox  was used. Thus, the structural connectivity was estimated by computing the number of streamlines, i.e., white matter fibers connecting gray matter regions, connecting each pair of regions of interest from the atlas, through sampling the principle directions previously calculated at each voxel. Per voxel, 5,000 streamlines were attempted, which resulted in a matrix of streamlines connecting each pair of ROIs.",e3d9f097-d307-4698-9765-33bf2ed072d5

Then, the matrix was filtered by applying a one-sample t-test to each individual connection, and only connections with p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons with false discovery rate (false discovery rate (FDR)) were kept.  Voxel-wise statistical analysis of scalar maps was performed using tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) procedures , implemented in FSL. First potential outliers from diffusion tensor fitting were removed by eroding the FA maps of each participant and zeroing the end slices.",63fa95ed-a4d2-49bc-a7cf-95816b9a9c1b
22,methods18," Then, a non-linear registration procedure was applied to align all FA images to a 1 × 1 × 1-mm standard space. To find the most representative FA image (i.e., the one requiring the least warping to align all images) that served as the study-specific template, the FA image from each participant was non-linearly registered to each other. Then, after this template image was affine-transformed into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 standard space, each FA map was transformed into standard space by combining the non-linear transformation to the FA target with the affine transformation into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Then, the skeleton image was obtained by skeletonizing the average of all FA images. The resultant skeleton image was thresholded at 0.3 so that skeleton regions, including multiple tissue types, could be removed. Finally, all scalar maps (FA, MD, AD, and RD) were projected onto the mean FA skeleton using the transformations applied to the FA images.",ec6294f5-840f-496e-9d7e-cfc944460329
23,methods19,"  Statistical Analyses Descriptive statistics were computed and reported as mean ± standard deviation for the continuous variables and number and percentages for categorical variables. Statistical differences between groups were studied through the Welch’s test due to the unequal groups’ sizes for continuous variables and x2 test for categorical variables.  To examine the association between the adherence to the MedDiet and cognitive scores, a multiple linear regression was performed. After the study of the statistical assumptions, the association of the adherence to the MedDiet, as measured by Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (MEDAS) (continuous variable) with memory and executive scores, was studied while controlling for age, sex, years of education, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score, body mass index (BMI), occupation, and energy intake.",846770f7-04e2-48e6-ab30-690c0b97608d
24,methods20,"  To study the association between adherence to the MedDiet and total brain volumes and White matter hypointensities (WMH), multiple linear regressions were performed. The three regression models tested accounted for (1) time between dietary assessment and MRI scans (time between dietary assessment and MRI scans (TBA)) and intracranial volume (intracranial volume (ICV)); (2) time between dietary assessment and MRI scans (TBA), intracranial volume (ICV), and age; and (3) time between dietary assessment and MRI scans (TBA), intracranial volume (ICV), age, sex, years of education, and body mass index (BMI). These analyses were rerun, excluding participants with implausible intake, i.e., participants whose energy intake is less than 500 kcal/day and greater than 3,500 kcal/day . In these analyses, two participants were excluded based on implausible intake criteria (Supplementary Material).",35a8c097-0101-4335-afc7-5f84328e0e8c

26,methods22," First, it tests the hypotheses at each individual connection in the network and thresholds it with a user-defined threshold (primary threshold). Then, subnetworks composed of connections whose significance exceeds the primary threshold are identified, and its significance is determined. The subnetwork significance is calculated by comparing their sizes to the distribution of the size of subnetworks obtained through 5,000 random permutations of the original hypothesis. To capture different effects, it is recommended to use different primary thresholds . Thus, in the present study, five different primary thresholds were used (p < 0.01, p < 0.005, p < 0.001, p < 0.0005, p < 0.0001) to capture less pronounced, but more extent, effects (less stringent primary threshold – p < 0.01) as well as localized and pronounced effects (most stringent threshold – p < 0.0001).",11276022-f8fe-408b-baaa-ae5b48a62fb2

The statistical analysis of the skeletonized maps of FA, MD, AD, and RD was performed using the permutation-based cross-participant statistics methods implemented randomly  and distributed with FSL. The same model was used as in the structural connectivity analysis. Ten thousand random permutations were used in the inference of the contrasts of interest. Threshold-free cluster enhancement (Threshold free cluster enhancement (TFCE)) was applied to detect widespread significant differences, and family-wise error (family wise error (FWE)) correction at p < 0.05 was used to correct for multiple comparisons.",9aa944f0-900e-4fc3-98a7-bf2fa5cb1dc2

35,results7,"Higher MedDiet Scores Associated With White Matter Integrity In a voxel-based tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis adjusted for time between assessments, age, sex, years of education, body mass index (BMI), and controlling for multiple comparisons, a higher MedDiet score was associated with higher fractional anisotropy (FA) values in several WM areas, including the corpus callosum, right superior longitudinal fasciculus, and corona radiata (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S7). Similarly, lower values of RD and MD were associated with high adherence to the MedDiet (Figure 3 and Supplementary Tables S8, S9).

37,results9,"  Adherence to the MedDiet Is Associated With Increased Structural Connectivity As for the pattern of structural connectivity in the brain (Figure 4), participants with high adherence to the MedDiet had a higher number of white fibers connecting a network in the left hemisphere for a threshold of p < 0.0005; such a network, with five connections, is composed of the olfactory cortex, amygdala, calcarine, lingual, and middle occipital gyri (MMediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (MEDAS)<10 = 0.0022 vs. MMediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (MEDAS)≥10 = 0.0066, p = 0.046, d = 0.642).

39,discussion0,"Mixed findings on the association of the MedDiet with cognitive function might be clarified by combining a multimodal neuroimaging approach with neuropsychological and dietary assessments. Thus, the present work focused on MRI-based measures as a function of the MedDiet adherence. This study reveals that a higher adherence to the MedDiet is associated with higher executive functioning scores. Moreover, it shows an association between adherence to the MedDiet and the microstructure of WM, as well as higher structural connectivity in a specific brain network. Yet, the multiple regression analysis showed that high adherence to the MedDiet was not associated with global brain volumes nor HypoV. These findings suggest that the MedDiet is associated with brain correlates that have been linked with cognitive performance .",c94dc65f-d2be-4fef-9ea0-a51487fcdf0a
40,discussion1,"  Our results are in line with studies showing that higher adherence to the MedDiet is associated with cognitive scores and white matter integrity . As for the cognitive scores, similar to that of McEvoy et al. (2019), high Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (MEDAS) was associated with executive functioning but not with memory scores. These findings might be related to the age of our cohort as executive functioning appears to decline earlier than other cognitive domains . Our results also confirm that high adherence to the MedDiet was associated with lower diffusivity values, including MD and RD . Interestingly, we found that differences in WM integrity, despite global, were also present in bundles linking limbic regions with the prefrontal cortex, including corpus callosum, internal capsule, cingulum, corona radiate, and superior longitudinal fasciculus.",0bf2edd9-9d4d-4a34-a006-14b44187a743
41,discussion2," As these brain areas are associated with reward and cognitive processes, and an association was found between obesity and WM integrity of bundles within the limbic system and tracks connecting the temporal and frontal lobe , it is possible that such alterations of the WM partially are associated with cognition and eating behaviors.  The observation herein reported that the MedDiet is associated with brain structural connectivity offers an important insight into the relationship between dietary patterns and brain structure. Participants with high adherence to the MedDiet displayed higher structural connectivity in a network linking the olfactory cortex, amygdala, calcarine, lingual, and middle occipital gyri on the left hemisphere. Such anatomical pattern, together with the fact that fiber length and numbers influence synaptic transmission (Honey et al.",c7ad832e-b142-41fd-b7b0-d82afceb53c1
42,discussion3,", 2009), allows us to speculate that this structural connectivity pattern might be related to the integration of sensory stimuli and reward. For instance, odor , visual food cues , and taste stimuli  have been reported to elicit amygdala activation. In addition, as the amygdala drives dopamine activation in the reward cycle , receives afferents from taste areas and somatosensorial and visual stimuli (Rolls, 2016), and projects to the orbitofrontal cortex , which is involved in the computation of the value of the stimuli (Gottfried et al., 2003; Rolls, 2016), it is possible that the higher connectivity between these specific regions is associated with a better integration of sensory/taste stimuli and, thus, is related with food intake.",8b820dfc-7ffa-4222-a71e-7e296bf48ecc
43,discussion4,"  In the same way that the amygdala was implicated in stimuli processing, the left middle occipital and left lingual were implicated in the integration of visual food stimuli . Interestingly, in a study where participants were exposed to a single food choice task, the left lingual gyrus and the left calcarine sulcus were more strongly activated in response to high-energy food cues when compared to low-energy choices. Additionally, the middle occipital gyrus activation covaried positively with the proportion of rejected high-energy choices (van der Laan et al., 2014). Altogether, as reduced neural responses to fat, sweet, and umami flavors in the reward circuit, executive control, and gustatory brain regions have been associated with increased intake of highly palatable food (Kure Liu et al., 2019), it is likely that the combined contribution of food-related stimuli integration systems is associated with food intake.",d859776d-63f2-4f9b-9a37-708fd2913b88
44,discussion5," Additional experiments are required to elucidate the relationship between the MedDiet, structural connectivity, and eating behaviors. If these findings are confirmed for future studies, these results might help to develop more effective interventions.  Note that the lateralization to the right reported in the white matter integrity is in line with that of Pelletier et al. (2015), where FA differences were represented on the right hemisphere . In terms of the structural connectivity, the network found on the left hemisphere might be related to the handedness of the studied population. That is, the functional lateralization of the taste processing was found to be lateralized according to the participants’ handedness, i.e., right-handed participants displayed a stronger activation of the left insula . As the participants of this study are all right-handed, that can partially explain our findings.",5c05ad37-c49b-457d-90fe-cfb25cd970e8
45,discussion6," Alternately, a lateralization was also hypothesized in terms of dietary decision making. More specifically, when individuals were asked to make decisions regarding which foods they would like to consume, increased activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was shown to be associated with healthier decisions .  The strengths of the present study include the use of a dietary assessment tool whose scoring allows comparisons between studies and a multimodal MRI approach. The scoring of Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (MEDAS) is based on cutoff points that better represented the observed dose–response relationships between the MedDiet and a significant protection against myocardial infarction in a case-control study (Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2002). This is in opposition to tools that use population sex-specific median, i.e., the scoring of each item of the questionnaire depends on the sample’s median consumption of each item.",922573d2-2803-4b1f-8a4e-b5f68816cbf0
46,discussion7," This scoring method makes it difficult to compare results between studies. Additionally, the multimodal MRI approach offers valuable understanding of the relationship between brain structure and dietary habits. Nonetheless, the results presented here should be interpreted with caution for several reasons. First, self-report of food intake can incur in underreporting of unhealthy food items and the opposite for healthy items (Zuniga and McAuley, 2015). However, the exclusion of participants with implausible dietary intake did not change the results (Supplementary Tables S10–14). At the same time, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (MEDAS) does not capture certain eating habits such as more processed foods, ready meals, and savory snacks, which might yield different scores ; yet, this does not seem to be the case as ascertained by the 24-h dietary recalls. The researchers were not blinded to the group assignment, i.e.",7236c048-1853-48de-a4da-6aebf0e993d0
47,discussion8,", low Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (MEDAS) vs. high Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screening (MEDAS), during the statistical analysis. However, the groups were formed based on a cutoff previously reported to indicate high adherence to the MedDiet. Also, dietary assessment was measured on an average of 18 months (range 16–25 months, 10.2% > 19 months) prior to the MRI scan and neuropsychological assessment. Yet, the consistency of the dietary pattern was confirmed by a non-significant paired t-test between the two moments. Second, the small sample size (n = 76) limits the generalization of the findings, precluding the use of sensitivity analyses to exclude participants with lower cognitive scores. Yet, it should be noted that none of the participants at baseline had a diagnosis of dementia nor mild cognitive impairment. Third, ApoE e4 status was not ascertained; however, its reported prevalence in the Portuguese population is lower (Rodrigues et al.",385c886c-c982-4e55-ad0e-402c430515aa
48,discussion9,", 2005) than for other cohorts . As for the probabilistic tractography connectivity analyses, this approach does not determine an absolute fiber count; instead, this method informs about the connection strength or whether the number of axons exceeds a certain value , and the results are deemed valid when compared to direct white matter neuron tracing . Last, despite adjustment for several factors, residual confounding cannot be ruled out as in all observational studies.  In summary, we have shown that high adherence to the MedDiet is associated with higher executive functioning scores and preserved white matter integrity of white matter bundles linking limbic regions with the prefrontal cortex and taste-processing regions.",16dc2b73-c31c-4fa8-aba3-0d967b07fc49
49,discussion10," Our results, together with findings from research on food decision making and weight loss programs, suggest that the low adherence to the MedDiet might be associated with brain alterations of regions involved in the processing and integration of taste, reward, and decision making, which could interfere with normal food–reward–decision function.
