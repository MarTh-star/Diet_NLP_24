0,introduction0,"In recent years, innovation in food industry has mainly been related to new scientific and technical approaches to food processing and to the introduction of novel 'functional' foods. The relevance of this latter type of food relates to the increasing cost of healthcare, increase in life expectancy, and the desire of elderly people for an improved quality of life in their latest years [1].  Most early developments in the above respect are related to food fortified with vitamins and/or minerals such as vitamin C, vitamin E, folic acid, zinc, iron, and calcium [2]. Subsequently, the focus shifted to food fortified with various micronutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids, phytosterols, and soluble fibre to promote good health or to prevent cancer and other dangerous diseases [3]. More recently, food companies have taken further steps to develop food offering multiple health benefits in a single product [4].",26ab1dd8-7974-476a-b303-7091f5615853
1,introduction1,"  Within the above frame, olive oil plays an important role in human diet and health, in the whole Mediterranean Area, thanks to its high contents of monounsaturated fatty acids and functional compounds, including tocopherols, carotenoids, phospholipids, and phenols. In this manuscript we will focus on these latter compounds, which have shown very good antioxidant properties and thus may help protect the organism from reactive species [5] and reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases [6; 7]. In addition, phenolic compounds can have beneficial effects also on the sensorial characteristics of olive oil, by protecting it against oxidation [8]. There is a strong interest in producing virgin olive oil (virgin olive oil (VOO)) or extra-virgin olive oil (Evirgin olive oil (VOO)) with high content in phenolic compounds, in order to increase the human daily assumption of these beneficial substances [9].",fa1235e3-7920-47d0-b106-2fc66c1dfdd0
2,introduction2,"  Phenolic compounds, including lignin, flavonoids, phytoalexins, tannins, originate from the metabolism of phenylpropanoids (PPs), which belong to the largest group of secondary metabolites produced by plants, also in response to biotic and abiotic stresses [10; 11]. L-Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase (Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL), EC 4.3.1.5) is the key enzyme for this biosynthetic pathway and its activity shows considerable variation according to the development stage of the olive fruit [12], as well as to possible stresses of various nature, such as irradiation, wounding, nutrient deficiencies, water shortage, herbicide treatment and viral, fungal, and insect attacks [13]. In general, the accumulation of phenolic compounds in olive drupes is a highly variable process, depending on the physiological state of the plant/fruit and it is the result of a complex balance between phenol biosynthesis and catabolism [14].",f8a31855-e34e-4d84-b76f-4c6c68680a67
3,introduction3," Furthermore, it should also be taken into account that, despite a wide range of phenolic compounds have been identified in virgin olive oil (VOO)s, only around 2% of these is transferred from the olive fruit to the virgin olive oil (VOO) during the mechanical extraction process, while the other 98% is retained in the olive cake and in the vegetation water. Therefore, the final phenol concentration in virgin olive oil (VOO) may be rather low, ranging from 20 to a maximum of 800 mg kg-1 [15]. As the consequence, the intake of phenolic compounds from olive oil is rather low for humans, compared to that from other phenolic sources [16]. Indeed, increasing phenolic content in virgin olive oil (VOO) and Evirgin olive oil (VOO) by using innovative cropping techniques and processing methods becomes relevant.  One possible way to reach the above objective is by using phenolic extracts in the form of additives.",aefa7075-ca81-4d78-af3d-2fc5e2c9f13b
4,introduction4," Some authors [15] added different concentrations of individual and combined phenolic compounds to virgin olive oil (VOO) lipid matrix of a refined olive oil, while other authors [17] studied the enrichment of edible oils with a phenolic extract obtained from olive leaves. Bouaziz et al. obtained similar results by adding olive leaf extracts to husk olive oils [18]. Suarez et al. evaluated some possible strategies for the development of phenol-enriched virgin olive oil (VOO), by using phenolic compounds obtained from olive cake [19].  Another possible strategy would be to exploit abiotic stresses, which produce an effect on Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) activity and, therefore, on the concentration of phenols within the plant. In this respect, research has shown that it was possible to increase the concentration of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil (VOO)s by inducing water stresses to olive trees [20; 21].",e84c2443-a724-4d83-bdb2-33a8166ea271
5,introduction5,"  A third line of action may be to adjust the cropping techniques of olive trees in order to promote a higher content in phenols. D’Amato et al. have studied the possibility of producing Se-enriched Evirgin olive oil (VOO) [22], by spraying the olive tree canopy at flowering with sodium selenate (Se-fertilization). The above authors showed that such Se-enrichment produced effects also on oxidative and water stresses, playing a role on the process of plant senescence [23; 24; 25]. Furthermore, other researches have shown that the biofortification with Se may increase Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) synthesis and/or Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) activity in several plant species [26; 27; 28]. As a consequence, it could be expected that Se-fertilization of olive trees may bring to a higher content of phenols in virgin olive oil (VOO), although no reference is available in this respect.",f45bc62d-5e51-4a6e-bbfc-c566371a67d2
6,introduction6,"  The aims of this research were to assess the effects of Se-fertilization on yield quality of olive trees (Olea europea L. cv. Leccino). In particular, this study considered the content of pigment and total phenols in leaves and drupes, the overall profile of phenolic compounds in olive drupes and the content of phenols in Evirgin olive oil (VOO).

7,methods0,"Plant material, site characteristics, and agronomic treatments This research was carried out in Central Italy (Torgiano, 220 m a.s.l., 43°02′ N and 12°43' E) in 2013 and 2014. Climatic conditions during the two years were monitored by the meteorological station at the Experimental Farm of the Department of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Sciences (University of Perugia), which is located nearby. The soil, derived from calcareous marl and classified as Typic Haploxerept (Soil Survey), is characterised by an alkaline pH (8.1), a loamy texture (sand 41%, silt 34%, clay 25%), 10.0 g kg-1 organic C, 2.0 g kg-1 total N, 5.5 mg kg-1 available P, and 190 mg kg-1 exchangeable K. Soil total Se concentration was 0.01 mg kg-1.  The seventeen years-old olive trees (cv. Leccino), were trained on monocone training system (about 4 m high) and with planting distances of 6.0 m between the rows and 3 m along the rows (North-South).",fea4fc3e-f689-470e-b5b9-31820c2ca284
8,methods1," The trees, pruned annually in the spring, were fertilized with manure. Irrigation was carried out in the morning, from late July to mid-September, using drip lines (two drippers per tree, each through a flow rate of 4 L h-1) for a total amount of 110 m3 ha-1; irrigation interventions were implemented according to measurements of the leaf water potential made by pressure chambers (Scholander chamber).  Treatment with selenium At the end of April (26th of April 2013 and 28th April 2014), before flowering, 21 randomly selected trees in 2013 and 21 randomly selected trees in 2014, were sprayed with a solution containing 100 mg L-1 of Se. This solution was obtained by dissolving sodium selenate (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) in water. For each treatment, 0.5% of the wetting agent “Bagnante” (Albamilagro International S.p.A., Parabiago, MI, Italy) was added. Each plant was treated with 10 L Se solution and wrapped with filter paper to prevent the solution from dripping onto the soil.",1aa45601-019b-4730-869f-507bfb98ea35
9,methods2," The paper was weighed before and after spraying to calculate the amount of solution that was absorbed by the plant, which was indeed 7.3 ± 1.4 L. On the other hand, twenty randomly selected ‘control’ trees were sprayed with the same technique, but with a water solution containing only the wetting agent.  Olive harvesting Olive drupes and leaves were hand-sampled at 15 days interval, starting from mid July to early November. Sampling dates for the two years are reported in Table 1.  10.1371/journal.pone.0176580.t001Table 1 Sampling dates for the two experimental years.

10,methods4,"  Virgin olive oil mechanical extraction process The experiments were conducted with an industrial plant using a TEM 200 system (Toscana Enologica Mori, Tavarnelle Val di Pesa, Florence, Italy) composed of a hammer mill, a malaxer with a gas controller system (with a working capacity of 200 kg of olives), and a two-phase decanter; for the separation of olive oil, a UVPX 305 AGT 14 centrifuge (Alfa Laval S.p.A., Tavarnelle Val di Pesa, Florence, Italy) was employed. The extraction was performed on a sample of 150 kg of olives and the malaxation was carried out by using a top-covered malaxing machine, for 30 min at 25°C, which is commonly found in industrial plants.  Extraction of Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase (Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL)) in fruits Samples of olive pulp (from 30 olives) were ground to a paste and used for biochemical assay.

The supernatant, stored on ice, was filtered through glass wool, placed on ice, and used as the source of crude enzyme.  Assay of Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) activity Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) activity in the enzyme extract was measured using the method of Lister et al. (1996) [29]. The reaction mixture comprised 1 mL of enzyme extract, 1 mL of 50 mM phenylalanine, and 1 mL of 150 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.4) and incubated at 37°C in a water bath for 1 h. Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) enzyme activity was assessed by measuring absorbance at 290 nm using a UV spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 210, Varian, Walnut Creek, CA, USA). Triplicate assays were performed for each enzyme extract.",ed994bd1-aa25-4f24-a3c4-b5d9a5e2063a
12,methods6," Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) enzymatic activity was expressed in μM cinnamic acid liberated per mg of protein per hour (μmol cinnamic acid ((mg of protein h)-1). Protein content in the enzyme extracts was measured using the method Bradford, using bovine serum albumin (bovine serum albumin (BSA)) as a standard [30].  Determination of total selenium content in fruits and oils The determination of total selenium content in fruits was made on samples dried in a hot air circulation oven at 65°C, for approximately 8–10 hours to constant weight. The fruits were milled into paste, while the analysis of oil was conducted on unaltered samples. Acid digestion of paste and oil samples (0.25 g each) was performed with a mixture of 10 mL of HNO3 and H2O2 (8:2 v/v) that were added to each vessel and the heating for 30 min to 200°C was applied [31]. All steps were performed at an applied power of 1000 W. Maximum pressure was set at 120 bar.",a2eb37b8-eceb-49c4-8683-96a3ef6e33ce

All analyses were carried out in triplicate.  Determination of total poliphenols in olive fruits The methodology to extract phenols followed an adaptation of the method of Fantozzi and Montedoro, 1978 [32]. Analyses were performed in triplicate. Approximately, 1 g of ground olive pulp from 25 olives was mixed in duplicate with 40 mL of hexane and the mixture was homogenised using an Ultra-Turrax homogeniser for 2 min; the upper phase was recovered and the extraction was repeated twice successively with the lower phase to allow removal of pigments and most of the lipids.",858412b4-149a-4329-86b6-a05801bb574f
14,methods8," Phenolic compounds were extracted twice with 80 mL of a mixture of methanol/water 80%/20% (v/v) containing 400 ppm of sodium metabisulphite. The aqueous methanol phases were combined and filtered. The supernatants containing the phenolic compounds were filtered through 0.45 μm syringe filters.  Aliquots of these extracts were assayed for total phenol content using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent according to the Folin–Ciocalteu method [33]. The extract (100 μL) was mixed with 50 μL of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent. After mixing thoroughly, 300 μL of saturated sodium carbonate solution was added and the mixture was shaken for 0.5 min. Finally, the solution was brought up to a volume of 1 mL with distilled water. After 30 min of reaction at ambient temperature in dark, the absorbance was measured at 765 nm in a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 210).",df02a177-4a69-4872-801b-8c2e52f259d7

Determination of chlorophylls and carotenoids in fruits Pigments (chlorophylls and total carotenoids) were also determined in fruits. Two grams of fruit samples (exocarp and mesocarp) were dissolved in 25 mL of 80% acetone in water. The solution was filtered through a double layer of cheese cloths and absorbances at 663.2, 646.5, and 470 nm were determined using a Varian Cary 210 spectrophotometer.

18,methods12," The phenolic compounds were quantitatively determined with DAD at 278 nm; fluorescence detector (FLD), operated at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission of 339 nm, was employed only to confirm the lignans peaks.  Data analysis Results for all experimental variables were submitted to three-way repeated measures ANOVA, by considering the 'treatment', 'sampling date' and 'year' as experimental factors. The 'tree' was included as the 'subject' random effect to account for the repeated measures in each tree and the variance was assumed as proportional to the mean, to account for heteroscedasticity. The analyses were performed by using the lme() function in R [37]. In order to summarise the results obtained in olives, the two-way matrix relating to Se content, Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) activity, total phenol content, total chlorophyll content, and carotenoid content for all observations (i.e.",4c4ccd5a-63bc-4791-a929-32121fc8221b
19,methods13," the data for all combinations 'treatment x sampling date x year') was submitted to Principal Component Analysis (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)). Data were standardised previous to the analysis and results were displayed on a distance-biplot [38].  Results and discussion In the year 2013 the total amounts of olives harvested were 527 kg and 519 kg for the control and Se-treated trees, respectively, while in the 2014 were 469 kg and 474 kg for the control and Se-treated trees, respectively.  Concerning weather conditions, the two experimental years showed contrasting characteristics. The year 2013 was characterised by a low rainfall level in summer (581 mm from April to October, with the lowest value, 27.2 mm, in August), while 2014 was more rainy, with rather abundant rainfall levels in summer (614 mm from April to October, with the lowest value, 44.6 mm, in August). Rainfall level in June-August was 56 mm in 2013 and 211 mm in 2014. The average temperature was 19.5 in 2013 and 18.",476b22f0-a237-4388-b711-3db3e5ea74e2

Considering olive drupes, total Se-content, Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) activity and total chlorophylls were significantly affected by the interaction ‘Se-fertilization × year × sampling date' (P levels respectively equal to 0.0001, 0.0052 and 0.0001). Otherwise, the content in carotenoids was significantly affected by the interaction ‘Se-fertilisation × sampling date' (P = 0.0123), while the content in phenols was significantly affected only by ‘Se-fertilisation’ (P = 0.0001) and such an effect was consistent across years and sampling dates (the interactions ‘Se-fertilisation × sampling date’ ‘Se-fertilisation × year’ and ‘Se-fertilisation × sampling date × year’ were not significant).",8427b38f-167a-478d-bcd7-3ea195b86b47

Indeed, both Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) activity and phenol concentration tended to decrease with sampling dates, although they were generally higher in Se-fertilized trees, with respect to the untreated controls (see Tables 3 and 4).",b0ea6aae-75d3-42f0-bac3-87f31b0779b2
23,methods23," Data followed by the asterisks are significantly different from the untreated control at the same year and sampling date (P < 0.05).  However, such a total increase in phenols should be better characterised by considering the different chemical classes (Tab. 6). In both years, phenolic alcohols slightly decreased, while secoiridoids derivatives increased. Considering the profile in terms of percentage variations, it is very interesting to note that the phenolic substances that were most positively affected by the treatment were 3.4-DHPEA-EDA (dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol or oleacein), which was increased on average by 57% (61% and 53% for the first and the second year, respectively) and ligustroside aglycone, with an average increment of 51% (54% in 2013 and 49% in 2014) (Table 6).",c2a18d6f-5de0-4e23-918d-59094c4c43ba
24,methods24,"  The p-HPEA-EDA (dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to tyrosol or oleocanthal), another important secoiridoid derivative, showed a lower increase (27 and 19%, respectively). The 3,4-DHPEA-EA was unchanged in the first year, while it increased considerably (32%) in the second year. Lignans did not show any change relating to Se-treatment. These results are relevant, because several studies show that 3.4-DHPEA-EDA is the main phenolic compound in Evirgin olive oil (VOO)s and it is characterised by a high antioxidant activity, which contributes to a good shelf-life and hypothensive and anti-inflammatory effects on human health [39; 40].  The average content of Se in Evirgin olive oil (VOO)s from Se-fertilised plants was 120 μg kg-1; considering a mean daily consumption of 20 g of Evirgin olive oil (VOO) and an Acceptable Daily Intake (Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)) of 55–70 μg Se day-1, the actual daily intake of Se would be 2.4 μg, corresponding to 4.3% and 3.",5b695507-5920-41a5-bdc0-f90f9bd44492
25,methods25,"4% of the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), respectively (Se), which seems to be a safe amount [41; 42].  In conclusion the practice of Se-fertilisation in olive trees (cv. Leccino) grown in years with different climatic trends positively influenced the phenolic composition of extra virgin olive oil, both in terms of total phenolic content and above all, in terms of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA. Therefore, this agronomic practice could represent a valid tool for improving the chemical profile of poor cultivars in terms of polyphenols, and, in particular, in terms of oleuropein derivatives. Furthermore, such an effect was consistent in two experimental seasons with contrasting weather patterns, particularly in terms of different water availability.",eab3e396-c40f-4b73-ba47-3933e279d73b
26,methods26," Indeed, the effect of Se-fertilisation helped maintaining a good phenolic profile, particularly in the year with more abundant rainfall level, while it is well known that phenolic accumulation in drupes is higher in years with warm temperatures and low water availability [43]  It is relevant to note that the improvement of phenolic profile in Evirgin olive oil (VOO)s was obtained by treating olive trees, with no direct enrichment of the final commercial product, which would be prohibited for Evirgin olive oil (VOO)s, considering that only physical treatment methods are allowed during the mechanical extraction process. It is also important to highlight that this procedure may be particularly useful with Evirgin olive oil (VOO)s characterised by a poor phenolic profile, which cannot meet the European Food Safety Authority (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)) statement about the admissibility of the health claim for Evirgin olive oil (VOO)s.",2cc25f66-cf56-4104-8c92-b351ff1fa688
27,methods27," Indeed, a well planned Se-fertilisation before flowering may help these Evirgin olive oil (VOO)s reach the minimum content of 5 mg of hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives (e.g. the oleuropein complex and tyrosol) in 20 g of product (corresponding to 250 mg kg-1 of oil) (EU, 2012) [39].  Future work should confirm that the above results can be reached also in other olive cultivars, apart from Leccino.  Supporting information S1 Table Original dataset. Table of original data.
