0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design and Population The Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA)) multicentric and cross-sectional study included a total sample of 4356 adolescents (51.6% females), aged 11–19 years [18]. Data were obtained from 10 European cities located in different geographical points within Europe, during 2006–2007. The Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study was designed to obtain reliable and comparable data on nutrition and health-related parameters, applying standardized procedures [19]. The Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of each study site and followed the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki 1964 (revision of 2000), good clinical practice, and the legislation about clinical research in humans in each one of the countries involved in the study [20].",3818dcf4-c6cb-436a-b84a-d62a24a37d13
1,methods1," Written informed consent was obtained by the parents/legal guardians of all participants. Blood sampling was performed in one third of the individuals randomly selected from the total sample (N = 1172) [19]. Inclusion of specific parameters to develop the present study (genomic, adiposity, cardiometabolic risk factors, and dietary data) provided a final number of 605 adolescents (51.6% female) meeting the selection criteria. Information of selection procedure is displayed in a flow chart (Figure 1).  2.2. Physical Examination, Adiposity Measurements and Cardiometabolic Risk Score Anthropometric measurements were performed by trained researchers following standard protocols [21]. Height was measured barefoot in the Frankfort plane with a telescopic height measuring instrument (Type SECA 225) to the nearest 0.1 cm, and weight was measured in underwear and without shoes with an electronic scale (Type SECA 861) to the nearest 0.1 kg.",c0376430-f134-4d44-a996-5f888f2b7c34
2,methods2," body mass index (BMI) was calculated from weight and height (kg/m2) [22]. Waist circumference (WC) was measured in triplicate with a nonelastic tape (SECA 200) to the nearest 0.1 cm as the mid-point between the lowest rib and the iliac crest [21], and the average of the three measures was used. Systolic blood pressure (Systolic blood pressure (SBP)) and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) were measured twice in sitting position separated in a 10- minute interval with a blood pressure oscillometric monitor device OMRON HEALTHCARE® (M6-HEM7001; OMRON HEALTHCARE®, Kyoto, Japan) The lowest blood pressure (BP) reading was used. Thereafter, the mean of arterial pressures (mean of arterial pressures (MAP)) of all participants was obtained from the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) + [(Systolic blood pressure (SBP) − diastolic blood pressure (DBP))/3)] formula.",1b95f6c3-70af-4102-938c-f6dee5e08376
3,methods3," Total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c), triglycerides (TG), and glucose were measured using enzymatic methods (Dade Behring, Schwalbach, Germany). Insulin levels were obtained from frozen serum using an Immulite 2000 analyzer (DPC Bierman GmbH, Bad Nauheim, Germany). As measurement of insulin resistance, the homeostatic model assessment (homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)) index was calculated from glucose and insulin measurements [23]. Moreover, a clustered cardiometabolic risk score was computed from the sum of the standardized z-scores of TC/HDL ratio, WC, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index, and mean of arterial pressures (MAP) [7]. The standardized z-scores of intended variables were calculated from the age and gender specific cut-off points [24]. Lower values in the score indicate better cardiometabolic risk profile.",f12181ea-b9ee-41a7-877c-9c97de704671
4,methods4," As sensitivity analyses, a second MetS risk score, comprising HDL-c, WC, Glucose, Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and TG, was obtained from the International Diabetes Federation (International Diabetes Federation (IDF)) guidelines [5]. HDL-c was multiplied by −1 as characterized by lower metabolic risk with increasing values. Results obtained with both cardiometabolic risk scores in adolescents have been included in the present analyses.  2.3. Dietary Intake Assessment and Mediterranean Diet Score Dietary habits were determined from a self-administered, computerized, validated 24-h dietary recall called the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) Dietary Assessment Tool (Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA)-DIAT) [25,26], a tool validated first in Flemish adolescents [26] and then adapted to be used in the 10 cities [27].",97d0c8a9-28a0-4782-85b1-4f5bace41a22
5,methods5," Participants completed the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA)-DIAT on two non-consecutive days within a time span of two weeks. This method has been used and recommended to assess dietary intake in European children and adolescents [28]. In order to calculate individual usual dietary intake, the multiple source method (multiple source method (MSM)) was used [28]. This method allows correction of dietary data for between and within individuals’ variability.  We used a Mediterranean diet score (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)) based on nine single components: vegetables, fruits and nuts, cereals and roots, pulses, fish, monounsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio, dairy products, meat, and alcohol. A scale indicating the degree of adhesion/adherence to the traditional MD was developed [29]. The description of MD food subgroup components is described elsewhere [30].",6d14ac96-8f74-4a09-aa29-0757c9b1d5b8
6,methods6," Vegetables, fruits and nuts, cereals, legumes, fish, dairy products, and unsaturated to saturated fat ratio positively contributed to the MD adherence, whereas meat (including processed meat) and alcohol consumption were inversely considered. Of note is that dairy products are positively considered as they are recommended during growth and development periods, such as adolescence [31]. Alcohol intake was regarded as an unhealthy habit among adolescents. Therefore, in a no-alcohol consumption situation, the value 1 was assigned, while any alcohol intake was computed as value 0. The MD adherence was constructed by a 0 to 9 points scale, with higher scores indicating greater adherence [32]. The sex-specific median intake (g/day) of all subgroups forming the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) is shown in Supplementary Table S1.  2.4. Genomic Information and Genetic Risk Score Standard methods for blood collection, transport, and analysis was performed by a certified laboratory [33].",59922aae-8815-4ca6-85db-bbd7975f1678
7,methods7," Blood sampling (EDTA K3 tubes) for DNA extraction, collection, and storage was performed at the Institute of Nutritional and Food Sciences (Institute of Nutritional and Food Sciences (IEL)) of the University of Bonn, and sent to the Laboratoire d’Analyse Genomique Centre de Ressources Biologiques (LAG-CRB) BB- 0033-00071 Institut Pasteur de Lille, F-59000 Lille, France. DNA was obtained from white blood cells with the Puregene kit (QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, France) and stored at −20 °C. The genotyping was done by an Illumina system (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) using the Golden Gate technology (sampling procedure scheme, GoldenGate; Software, Inc, San Francisco, CA, USA).",195b15e5-c24d-4c09-ace5-66c0bfd710fe
8,methods8,"  To analyze the influence of genetic information on the association between MD and adiposity and cardiometabolic biomarkers, we used the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) developed from Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) adolescents (submitted but not yet accepted) [34] using 21 SNPs significantly associated with overweight/obesity, defined as the equivalent to body mass index (BMI) > 25kg/m2. The main characteristics of SNPs forming the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) are displayed in Supplementary Table S2. Also, a comparative analysis by sex is shown in Supplementary Table S3.  2.5. Statistical Analysis To test the variables´ normality, the Shapiro–Wilk test was performed. As not all variables follow a normal distribution, the descriptive sex-specific characteristics are displayed as median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)) for continuous variables; absolute and relative frequencies are shown for categorical variables.",2e6fa064-8d12-473a-9492-69b8364cbc8b
9,methods9," In order to compare differences by sex, the statistical Pearson’s chi-square test was used for categorical variables and the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test for continuous variables.  Sex-specific multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between adiposity and cardiometabolic parameters and the interaction effect between the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) and MD, adding to the effect of MD alone in the same model.  RStudio Version 1.2.5001 (RStudio Team (2015). RStudio: Integrated Development for R. RStudio, Inc., Boston, MA, USA, URL http://www.rstudio.com/) was used to perform all statistical analyses and p < 0.05 was the significance level set in the present analysis.  3. Results 3.1. Descriptive Characteristics of the Study Sample The main characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1. In summary, there were significant differences between males and females for weight and height (p ≤ 0.",1bad8a81-7186-4cff-9bcd-013986eb6c07
10,methods10,"001) although no significant differences were found for body mass index (BMI). Regarding cardiometabolic risk factors, girls had higher WC (p ≤ 0.001) and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) (p = 0.044), whereas boys showed higher Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p ≤ 0.001), mean of arterial pressures (MAP) (p ≤ 0.001), and MetS (p ≤ 0.001) than girls. There were no significant differences for the remaining cardiometabolic parameters. The distribution of obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) among participants is displayed by sex in Figure 2. Focusing in the SNPs included in the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS), no statistically significant differences between sex were found in Supplementary Table S3.  3.2.",c966deaa-2366-4def-8a83-64c28a2e5693
11,methods11," Interaction between MD and Obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) on Adiposity/Cardiometabolic Variables Table 2 shows the association between the cardiometabolic parameters in relation to MD and the interaction between MD and the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) in the additive model, by sex groups.  Considered within the additive model (Table 2), MD adherence had a protective role over body mass index (BMI) (male p < 0.01 vs. female p ≤ 0.001), WC (male p < 0.05 vs. female p ≤ 0.001), and MetS (male p < 0.05 vs. female p ≤ 0.01) in both sex groups. However, the association of the MD with homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) (p < 0.05) and Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p < 0.05) was only observed in females, and the association of the MD with mean of arterial pressures (MAP) (p ≤ 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p < 0.05) only in males.",423567d3-7af7-4411-aa88-d25f14a0e208
12,methods12,"  Furthermore, both the MD and the interaction between MD and obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) were significant in the case of body mass index (BMI) for both sex groups; the inverse association between the MD and body mass index (BMI) was higher in females than in males (females p ≤ 0.001 vs. males p < 0.01). When studying the cardiometabolic variables, we observed significant interactions between obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) and MD in both sex groups for WC (p < 0.05) and MetS (p < 0.05). For both adiposity and cardiometabolic variables, females showed stronger interactions than males. Moreover, the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) and MD showed a significant interaction on mean of arterial pressures (MAP) (p < 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p < 0.01) for males only, whereas the interaction on homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) was only significant for females (p < 0.05).",7ea41916-63a1-4d73-a74a-5601b2dc0eec
13,methods13,"  Figure 3 shows the interaction effects of the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) and the MD on body mass index (BMI), WC, and MetS for male and female participants. The relations between the MD and body mass index (BMI), WC, and MetS were modulated by the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) values. In order to interpret the abovementioned variables, different sub-figures have been displayed in a matrix panel according to each sex group for body mass index (BMI), WC, and MetS. Different lines were drawn to relate MD and adiposity and cardiovascular biomarkers modulated by the distribution of the genetic predisposition to obesity in our population. It must be remarked that the majority of the adolescents were concentrated in the central parts of the graph, within 20-26 risk alleles (82.3% of the total population); therefore, extreme values should be interpreted cautiously.",17ad1fac-f161-4cd6-a174-fff63d10571d
14,methods14," Thus, for those participants represented with a negative slope, a higher MD adherence could act as a protective factor in relation to cardiometabolic factors despite their genetic predisposition to obesity (high or low).  Regarding the adiposity parameters, a total of 46.8% of males (those with 22 risk alleles or below) with higher MD adherence had lower body mass index (BMI); in 98.1% of females (in those individuals scoring 27 risk alleles or below), a higher MD adherence was associated with lower body mass index (BMI), attenuating the genetic risk to obesity. For WC, we also observed that 19.8% males (≤20 risk alleles) with higher MD adherence, had lower WC; however, 95.2% of females (≤26 risk alleles), had also lower WC levels.  Concerning MetS, 4.8% of males with higher MD adherence had lower cardiometabolic risk score if the risk score was ≤18. More so, 95.2% of females having higher MD adherence showed higher MetS scores if the risk score was ≤26.",3874fe2b-82c9-41f3-a6a2-642feddf52d2
15,methods15," In terms of sensitivity analyses, the MetS analyses were repeated using the MetS score following the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommendations. In males, the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) and MD showed a significant interaction on MetS (p = 0.001) but not on the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) MetS score (p = 0.092). However, the interaction was significant for both MetS scores in females (p = 0.005 vs. p = 0.003).  There were sex-related differences in the interaction between genes and diet on other cardiometabolic parameters, such as homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean of arterial pressures (MAP). Specifically, in females with higher MD adherence, those having ≤25 risk alleles had lower homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) levels (89.4% of the adolescents). Male participants with higher MD adherence with an obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) ≤21 (31.4% of the adolescents) had lower diastolic blood pressure (DBP).",af447561-9ca8-4ddb-8096-bc15cb3cfe31
16,methods16," Likewise, males with higher MD adherence and an obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) ≤22 (46.8% of the adolescents) had a lower mean of arterial pressures (MAP). The interaction effects of the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) and MD on homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean of arterial pressures (MAP) for male and female participants are displayed in Supplementary Figure S1.  4. Discussion The main findings of the present study indicate that the influence of high MD adherence on adiposity and MetS was only expressed when a limited number of risk alleles were present. As a result, the gene–diet interaction effect was higher in females than in males.  The MD has previously been shown to provide numerous health benefits [35], such as the reduction of risk factors for non-communicable diseases [36,37]. However, little is known about how the genetic variations among individuals determine the response to MD adherence [38].",a65dd91d-758c-45e0-b1fa-be1c8219a489
17,methods17," To our knowledge, no previous studies have assessed their interaction effects using an obesity-related genetic risk scores (GRS). Instead, isolated SNPs from candidate genes previously associated in the literature with adiposity or MetS were examined. More so, no gene–diet interaction studies on adiposity and cardiometabolic parameters considering the MD were found in adolescents, as the majority of studies have been conducted in adult populations.  Concerning adiposity, similar findings were observed in a study where the FTOrs9939609 and MC4Rrs17782313 polymorphisms showed an interaction with the MD adherence, which reduced the risk of obesity and T2DM [39].",5d9fdf89-f508-43be-bd82-7ea7548b5f73
18,methods18," In line with our findings, one study also showed low adiposity levels in relation with the interaction effect with different allele combinations, and considering other dietary approaches different to the MD: low polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) intake showed an inverse association with obesity risk (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2) when the ADAM17i33708A polymorphism was present [40]. Another study, considering high saturated fat intake, showed a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) in the GG carriers of the THRArs1568400 than in the A carriers [41], suggesting counter-productive effects in comparison to our study.",d04eb5dd-3b90-4d07-9aad-2739ac8071d9
19,methods19," In the current study, not only body mass index (BMI), but also WC, a surrogate marker of abdominal adiposity, showed lower levels in both male and female adolescents, as a result of the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS)–MD interaction; to our knowledge, no similar findings have been reported in other studies with similar characteristics.  Regarding MetS, we found no studies assessing a gene–diet interaction effect on a MetS risk score. We have also assessed cardiometabolic parameters individually. Our results showed low homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) levels in the majority of females modulated by the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS) when adhering to the MD. One study assessing the effect of increasing the ratio of saturated fat to carbohydrate intake, showed higher homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) levels in carriers of the minor allele (PLIN11482G>A) [42].",d65036e2-6453-42a7-bb76-a386625e4111
20,methods20,"  Concerning diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the male adolescents with higher MD adherence had lower levels of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when having 21 or fewer risk alleles. Our findings are coincident to one intervention study promoting the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) diet, where AA carriers of the Angiotensinogen genotype (G-6A ANG polymorphism) showed the greatest reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [43]. No interaction studies considering the mean of arterial pressures (MAP) levels were reported in the literature.  Despite the fact that we did not observe an effect on HDL-c, we included the TC:HDL ratio variable in our MetS score, showing a significant association with the gene–diet interaction. In this sense, Ordovás et al.",56eb6811-5a63-40ed-a2ce-be297854f3ae
21,methods21," observed that women carriers of the A allele of the APOA1 gene (G-A polymorphism) responded with higher HDL-c concentrations to a high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake, whereas the opposite effect was observed in the G carriers [44]. Other authors have also pointed novel genes–nutrients interactions with high-carbohydrate diets in GG carriers of KCTD10i5642G>C and MMAB3U3527G>C and C allele carriers of KCTD10V206VT>C, contributing to lower HDL-c concentrations [45].  When adhering to the MD, no associations were found in terms of TG levels. However, another study showed that, after 12 months of a MD-based intervention, higher levels of HDL-c and TG were seen in those individuals carrying the T allele of the CETPrs3764261 than in those with the GG genotype [46]. Another study showed that the TNF-alphars1800629 GG subjects had higher levels of TG than A carriers in MetS patients after another MD intervention [47].",8567eec0-985d-434a-82df-ae374fa756d4
22,methods22," Finally, other authors assessed the interaction between PPARAL162V and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake, noticing lower TG levels with higher intake in the V carriers [48].  In order to compare the present results to other cardiometabolic definitions, the development of our MetS score was compared to another MetS score, following the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommendations. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) score showed no association with the genetic risk scores (GRS)–MD interaction in males. This fact could be due to the different age and gender specific criteria selected to define the cut-off points between authors. Nevertheless, positive associations of the genetic risk scores (GRS)–MD interaction were seen in the female group for both MetS scores. The consensus to use unified criteria to identify adolescents at risk of MetS remains under development.  The present study has some limitations.",d30787e9-d3a5-40e3-846c-878113a2b568
23,methods23," As the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) project is a cross-sectional study, cause–effect relationships cannot be established. Moreover, only selected risk loci are available in the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study. When constructing the obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS), it has been calculated that body mass index (BMI) changes can be explained by a small proportion of genetic variants discovered so far [49], so potential rarer variants yet to be found might emerge when Genome-Wide Association Studies (Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)) are carried out.  On the other hand, the study presents several strengths. Most analyses from previous studies were focused on specific single SNPs interactions, whereas the present study used an obesity-genetic risk scores (GRS), considered as a useful genetic tool [50], to predict adiposity and MetS in European adolescents.",554370c6-c1db-4038-a449-8fec89a9fe0a
24,methods24," More so, the development of the cardiometabolic risk score was considered appropriate for the present study as it provides higher sensitivity and low susceptibility to errors compared to other approaches [51]. Furthermore, we included the whole MD pattern developing a cluster of different food groups in an adherence scale rather than considering single macronutrients or individual specific food groups´ intake. Additionally, different effects were identified in males and females. There is different behavior dependent on sex, not attributable to genetic predisposition, maybe associated with physical activity. Due to the multicentric design of the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study, congregating participants from 10 European cities, the researchers have been provided with large datasets from diversely distributed populations across Europe.",e581a51b-48bd-435d-89b7-d76e8d848f5c
25,methods25," Finally, the study is focused on adolescents, a population age that is understudied and where early detection plays a key role in the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Little has been found in the literature using a similar approach, where most similar studies are available on adult populations.  As MetS and excess of adiposity may occur at any stage from childhood to adulthood, early detection and diagnosis is fundamental to elaborate on health prevention programs among youth to effectively reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and T2DM [52,53]. At the same time, it has been previously shown that greater adherence to MD was associated with a significant improvement in overall health status among youth, suggesting the implementation of a MD dietary pattern for primary prevention of major chronic diseases [54]. The effect of the interventions would be heterogeneous depending on the genetic background of the individuals and should be considered in the efficacy analyses.",d9d6ac06-d5f5-4d62-be91-6b56d734d7c2
26,methods26,  5. Conclusions Obesity-related genotypes had a modulation effect in the relationship between MD adherence and obesity and MetS risk in European adolescents. The genes–diet interaction effect on MetS was stronger in females than in males. These observations strengthen the idea of applying genomic information to promote targeted dietary advice. ,3ab1751d-e28c-4dba-8582-6089f00d0968
