At 630 nm, the Total Phenolic Content (TPC) of the extracts was carried out in a concentrations range of 5–0.156 mg/ml.  At concentrations of 5, 2.5, and 1.25 mg/ml, aqueous/methanol extract showed the highest Total Phenolic Content (TPC) with 0.44, 0.24, and 0.100 mg/ml equivalent of gallic acid, respectively. Ethanol extract results were 0.40, 0.24, and 0.16 mg/ml at the same mentioned concentrations. The third one in a raw was water extract with values of 0.33, 0.142, and 0.065 mg/ml gallic acid equivalent, and, finally, the lowest content was n-hexane with values of 0.12, 0.046, and 0.024 mg/ml (Figure 2).",35ffdceb-c45a-416a-8b14-32cf103b4d54

31,results12,"  The Effect of Barley Bran Different Extracts on Phagocytosis  Phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages was identified by measuring the ability of NBT reduction after treatment with different extracts. We estimated the extracts' effects on phagocytic indices of the cells after 1-h incubation with yeast cells and NBT. The results revealed that peritoneal phagocytic activity was significantly increased after exposure to the extracts at concentration that ranged from 5 to 0.625 mg/ml. At concentration of 5 mg/ml, n-hexane had the highest increase with 1,108% of phagocytic activity, followed by ethanol with 784% and aqueous/methanol with 497%, while water extract had a lower activity at the same concentration with phagocytic index of 445% (Figure 4).

At a concentration that ranged within 5–0.625 mg/ml, the pinocytotic activity was enhanced under exposure to different extracts. N-hexane extract produced the highest increase in the pinocytotic activity with value of 2.9 compared with control value of 0.8. However, the pinocytotic activity of aqueous/methanol, ethanol, and water extracts was 2.3, 1.5, and 0.9, respectively (Figure 5).

33,results14," After that, we waited for 15 days with the continuing of feeding until the day of the sacrifice. Caliper digital was utilized to measure the tumor sizes, and then the tumors were weighed at the end of the study.  Tumor size in mice given fodders with barley bran was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared to the control group (Table 9). Feeding 10, 20, and 30% barley bran with fodders showed significant inhibition of tumors where a reduction in tumor size was reported −53.4, −54.2, and −47.7%, respectively. These values are significantly lower than the negative control group, which showed an increase in tumor size by 107.02% (Figure 6). Only one case of death was recorded for the control group. Groups-treated barley bran showed no mortality. The percentages of mice with no detectable tumor in groups Numbers 1 (10% BB), 2 (20% BB), and 3 (30% BB) were 20, 20, and 30%, respectively.

36,discussion0," Increased emphasis has now been put on complementarity and alternative medicine (complementarity and alternative medicine (CAM)) anti-cancer therapies due to the rapid rise in cancer incidence and mortality. Medicinal herbs have been used in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiotherapy as adjunctive therapy to minimize drug resistance and side effects such as osteoradionecrosis (14). Barley bran has secondary metabolites, such as saponins, tannins, phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, steroids, and carbohydrates that play a crucial role in cancer prevention (14). In this study, crude extracts of barley bran were prepared and assessed for their anticancer and immunomodulatory effect. Ethanol, n-hexane, aqueous/methanol, and water extracts were produced in vitro by maceration and examined for their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7, HCT-116, A549, EMT6/p, and the VERO normal monkey kidney cell line.",a961d877-e0a5-44ac-92b8-c064a1055bfb
37,discussion1," On the other hand, an in vivo study was performed to examine the prophylactic and antitumor effects of the barley bran on female Balb/C mice inoculated with the EMT6/p breast cancer cell line. Barley bran extracts were capable to inhibit tumor progression in vitro and in vivo experiments.  In a dose-dependent way, barley bran extracts showed potent inhibitory effects on cancer cells. Based on the registered results, n-hexane and aqueous/methanol extracts inhibited the cellular growth of all tested cancer cell lines (Figures 1B,C). Ethanol extract was active against all cancer cell lines; however, water extract was only active against EMT6/p and HCT-116 cell lines (Figures 1A,D).  As quantitative phytochemical screening tests were performed for all extracts, the phytochemical active constituents were revealed. N-hexane extract has terpenoids, steroids, flavonoids, and carbohydrates, while aqueous/methanol extract has saponins, phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, and carbohydrates.",7fb2d36e-7e78-4a9e-b895-21ea52cc9712
38,discussion2," Further analysis was applied using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to determine the most important phytochemicals in n-hexane and aqueous/methanol extracts (Tables 5, 6). These findings are consistent with previously conducted study, which revealed phenolic acids, flavonoids, lignans, tocols, and phytosterols as phytochemicals in barley (14). These phytochemicals affect cancer through the regulation of various molecular pathways involved in tumor growth and progression. Proliferation inhibition, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, immune system modulation, and improvement of the antioxidant environment are the particular mechanisms of phytochemicals (26). By modulating the levels of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) in cells, herbal extracts rich in phenolic compounds can control cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis.",dc17a5d9-a17a-46f4-a8eb-cd5dc285fd79
39,discussion3," Also, plant phenolic acids played an important role in inhibiting cancer growth in several in vitro observations, preclinical and epidemiological studies (27). Our qualitative phytochemical screening revealed the presence of phenolic compounds in many extracts. Reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) regulate cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis by causing genetic mutations, increasing oxidative stress, and activating oncogenes (28). A previous study showed that barley seeds extracts have antioxidant activities (29), which might explain the ability of our extracts to inhibit the viability of cancer cells.  Guneidy et al. (30) showed that there were large preventive effects and small cytotoxic effects of flavonoids on various cancer cell lines, for instance, the MCF-7 cell line. Flavonoids were also effective against A549, and HCT-116. Li et al. (31) revealed that the flavonoids can reduce cell proliferation and metastasis; also, they can strengthen apoptosis.",3714bda6-c558-43ac-9543-5d133a977219
40,discussion4," Moreover, trihydroxy-methoxyflavone showed antiproliferative activity against human leukemia cells through inducing apoptosis (cell-programmed death), and activating the MAPK pathway (32). As the four extracts contained flavonoids, the previous study confirmed the ability of all extracts to have antitumor properties.  Thoppil and Bishayee (33) showed the cytotoxic and chemopreventive effects of terpenoids on different cancer cell lines. Also, Bardon et al. (34) showed the inhibition effect of terpenoids on tumor growth. In order to demonstrate the antiproliferative activity of n-hexane against all tested cancer cell lines, Kumar et al. (35) showed that n-hexane was utilized as a main solvent in the terpenes extraction. Moreover, alkaloids are essential phytochemicals in plants. Several alkaloids isolated from natural herbs possessed anti-metastasis and anti-proliferation effects on various cancer forms, both in vitro and in vivo (36).",a4e17212-f254-4269-b247-8fa9e9b3df19
41,discussion5," Also, Talib (37) showed that the cellular growth of EMT6/p was inhibited by alkaloids. Our results showed that flavonoids and carbohydrates were found in both n-hexane and aqueous/methanol extracts, which confirms the potent cytotoxic effects of these two extracts against different cancer cell lines.  Barley is regarded as a good phytosterol source, even though the phytosterol level of barley is moderate compared to other major grains (38). Awad and Fink (39) showed that natural dietary plant sterol intake can have a beneficial impact and may prevent cancer of the colon, prostate, and breast. Sitosterol is the most abundant type of sterol in barley, as in most grains (38). Numerous mechanisms of action against cancer were proposed for phytosterols, including activation of apoptosis, reduction of carcinogen production, and stimulation of the sphingomyelin cell cycle (40). Beta glucans are complex carbohydrates made up of polysaccharides.",d13961fd-7f8d-4dc2-b0a6-280bf30c0508
42,discussion6," Beta-glucans were utilized to slow cancer growth and prevent it from spreading to other parts of the body (41). In our study, n-hexane and aqueous/methanol extracts possessed potent cytotoxic activity, which can be explained by the presence of steroids and carbohydrates, respectively.  In our study, saponins were detected in aqueous/methanol extract. Geronimo et al. (42) showed that the saponins inhibited the cellular growth of different cancer cell lines. Saponins and tannins possessed antitumor properties in MCF-7 and HCT-116 (42).  As we made Folin-Ciocalteu procedure, total phenolic content was highest in aqueous/methanol. The main phenolic groups in barley are ferulic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, and p-coumaric acid (14). A previous study showed that barley can act as an excellent natural diet for its anti-proliferative capacity because it has abundant content of phenolic acids (14). Anthranilic acid derivatives inhibited different cancer cell lines, including A549.",623c8654-d786-47d5-9bfa-fac433f26aeb
43,discussion7," A study revealed that γ-Linolenic acid exerted potent inhibitory effect on pheochromocytoma cancer cells (43). Palmitic acid was able to reduce cell viability in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by enhancing the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, including caspase-3, 9, Bax, and P53 (44). These results confirm the cytotoxicity effect of aqueous/methanol and n-hexane extracts, respectively.  Vero cells are cell lineages that were first isolated from kidney epithelial cells taken from an African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops). Yasumura and Kawakita developed the lineage in 1962. The original cell line was termed “Vero” after an acronym of verda reno, which means “green kidney”(45). The Vero cell lineage is continuous and aneuploid, which means it contains an aberrant number of chromosomes. A continuous cell lineage can be replicated through many cycles of division without becoming senescent.",1cc2c11f-7d2b-4b34-9f13-fef179fe1fa0
44,discussion8," Vero cells have the interferon-alpha/beta receptor; thus, they respond appropriately when recombinant interferon is given to their culture media (45). Ethanol, n-hexane, aqueous/methanol, and water extracts of barley bran showed limited toxicity against the VERO cell line with IC50 value more than 5 mg/ml. This may demonstrate the safety of all extracts against normal cells.  The immune system is a complex network of cells and proteins that defend the body against invading microorganisms and against tumor cells. Immune system modulation can be achieved through a range of specific and non-specific approaches. Immunomodulation refers to any changes in the immune system, and it can be induction, expression, amplification, or inhibition of any part in the immune system (46). Lymphocytes are a critical part of the acquired immune system, and their ability to proliferate is seen as a measure of the extent of cell immunity (46).",6ae1b739-c41f-4928-baec-34f71c3bcd8b
45,discussion9,"  According to our findings, the proliferation of both T and B lymphocytes was increased by barley bran extracts with some variation. The rising level of splenic lymphocytes upon using barley bran indicates an immune-stimulatory effect on the acquired immune system.  Either in the presence of Con A or LPS, n-hexane extract was the most effective extract with the highest stimulation index followed by aqueous/methanol (Figures 3A,B). Also, n-hexane extract was the most effective extract in the absence of both Con A and LPS. These findings may be clarified by the fact that most of the phytochemicals existed in plants had immune-stimulating activity (47). It was reported that methoxylated flavonoids have the ability to inhibit CYP1B1 activity and mRNA expression in human oral squamous cell carcinoma SCC-9 cells (48). Terpenoids had anticancer and immune-stimulating activities (49).",69a728c0-29d2-47ff-805e-da4e8a054144
46,discussion10," A study showed that the percentage of T and B cells along with the induction of Splenocyte proliferation in both resting and LPS-stimulated cells was risen by plant-derived polyphenols (50). Saponins were utilized to increase lymphocyte proliferation, enhance cytolytic activity of natural killer cells (NK), and produce a high CD4+/CD8+ ratio (51). Furthermore, the immunostimulatory effects of carbohydrates derived from barley leaf were revealed by enhancing splenocytes proliferation and NK cytotoxic activity with a significant rise in Th1 cytokines (52). Stearic acid derivatives can influence the anti-inflammatory activity through the inhibition of NO and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, significantly upregulates the expression of signaling lymphocytes-activation molecule family Member 3 through the JAK/STAT5 pathway as well as increased the induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL17A, and IL-2 (53).",b0141d5b-4b6a-4b64-bb3e-79c4fe80e2e5
47,discussion11," γ-Linolenic acid has been proved to boost lymphocytes, which are important components of immunological response. γ-Linolenic acid may also have crucial roles in cancer treatment. It demonstrated some improvement in immunologic status in patients with estrogen-sensitive breast cancer and bladder cancer (54). The relevance of γ-Linolenic acid stems from the fact that it is the precursor of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes, which operate as mediators of inflammation and immunological processes in diseases like cancer, diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and cellular aging (55). Other study showed that tricin, a type of trihydroxy-methoxyflavone, possessed antiangiogenic activity in vitro. It was able to reduce VEGF expression, inhibit HIF-1α accumulation in tumor cells, and modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in endothelial cells (52).",1efe0487-0126-4e4a-963f-d4e29e7f3b0e
48,discussion12,"  The effects of barley bran on innate immune system were evaluated by utilizing phagocytic activity test and pinocytic activity test. Endocytosis includes both phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking). The frontline defensive mechanism against pathogen invasion and a crucial part of the innate immune system was phagocytosis. Macrophages were recognized for their phagocytic activity and capacity to polarize into phenotypes, which are pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) (56). During carcinogenesis, M1-like polarization of anti-tumor macrophages was involved in the removal of more immunogenic tumor cells (57). This study showed that barley bran has the ability to increase the phagocytic activity of macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. N-hexane extract was the most active, followed by ethanol extract, while aqueous/methanol and water were less active (Figure 5).",3b7b25d4-c5fc-4557-a72e-1698e190f7ee
49,discussion13,"  The high immune-stimulating effect of n-hexane extract might be due to the high content of flavonoids. A previous study showed that oral flavonoids were utilized to enhance the activity of macrophages through converting β-glucuronidase to aglycones in macrophages (58). Immunostimulation in γ-Linolenic acid was characterized by a rise in phagocyte oxidative burst, CD4 + CD8-lymphocytes in blood, and the CD4: CD8 ratio (59). Stearic acid can stimulate the NF-κB pathway via TLR4 signaling (60). Other studies have shown that palmitic acid was able to enhance activation of TLR4 and NF-?B pathways as well as increase secretion of IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β, and activation of TLR2 (61). Immunostimulation activity and phagocytic induction were revealed by phytosterols by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhancing the production of NO (62).",8fbe666b-5bbc-4fa0-a72c-c7196bc386af
50,discussion14,"  For pinocytic activity assay, our findings revealed that the activity of pinocytosis of barley bran was increased in a dose-dependent model. N-hexane and aqueous/methanol showed high activity compared to control (Figure 5).  An in vitro study revealed that plant-derived polysaccharides could stimulate murine lymphocyte proliferation, increase murine pinocytic activity, and enhance releasing of nitric oxide (NO), IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in macrophages (63). Palmitic and stearic acids can activate inflammatory pathways in microglia, as evidenced by an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) (60). Other study demonstrated that the phytosterols stimulated phagocytosis and pinocytosis activity (64). These facts may describe the pinocytic activity of n-hexane and aqueous/methanol extracts of barley bran.",9f19a88e-2675-49f3-a813-d5e6420e83bf
51,discussion15,"  For the in-vivo part, the size of breast tumor was reduced compared to the control group with the usage of 30% bran fodder. This reflects the prevention ability of barley bran usage against breast cancer. Reddy et al. (65) revealed the prevention effect of bran on colon cancer in rats when bran oil was utilized with 2% in their food, leading to a significant decrease in the incidence of cancer when it was fed before and after inoculation. Other study showed that the rats were fed 20% wheat bran fodder and a significant decrease in the size of the colon cancer foci was revealed (66). Using tramp mice as a prostate cancer model, Carter et al. (67) found that the incidence of cancer was decreased significantly due to its antioxidant effect by feeding them wheat bran diet in different concentrations.  Xiao et al. (68) listed the prevention of breast cancer and how the estrogen binding capacity of wheat bran could contribute to prevent breast cancer.",eac4ff13-b0ff-42f2-b327-9ba3b9c4183d
52,discussion16,"  In determining the influence on cytokine's level, the 30% group showed higher concentration of interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-2 compared with the negative control group. interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-2 are Th1 cytokines, while IL-4 and IL-10 are Th2 cytokines. A balanced ratio of Th1/Th2 cytokines is observed in healthy humans. Increased concentrations of Th2 cytokines were observed in patients with different tumor types. Inhibition of Th2 cytokines and enhancement of Th1 were significantly observed in the 30% barley bran group. It revealed the influence of arabinoxylans present in the bran. Arabinoxylans had an immune boosting effect when Balb/c mice were fed enzymatically modified bran. Li et al. (69) showed that ergosterol has the ability to potentiate the immune system. Kumar et al. (70) revealed the immunomodulatory activity of terpenoids. The immunomodulatory and antitumor activities of carbohydrates were demonstrated by Gajos et al. (71).",8c43ac7b-cbf6-46d9-a769-add66c096bc3
53,discussion17," A previous study showed that the flavonoids could activate the secretion of interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-2 (72). Another study revealed that the production of interferon (interferon (IFN))-g was induced by beta-glucan.  Barley contains about 17% fiber, which is one of the highest percentages of any whole cereal grain. Fiber in barley bran includes beta glucan, arabinoxylan, and lignin. Barley bran fiber has been proved to improve glycemic response, blood lipid attenuation, intestinal enzymatic activity, dietary digestibility, and gut flora (73).  Fiber can aid in the prevention of constipation and diarrhea by generating a bulk within the digestive tract and so regulating bowel movements. A study investigated the impact of adding more barley to adult women's diets and discovered that, after 4 weeks, barley intake had a positive influence on both lipid metabolism and gastrointestinal function (74). Fiber is also necessary for a healthy bacterial balance in the digestive tract.",8e2caf4a-730c-4ced-ae42-90581296164f
54,discussion18," It essentially feeds probiotic bacteria in the gut, assisting in the production of short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, which have anti-inflammatory properties and may aid in the treatment of symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis (74).  Lignan may offer protection against the development of cancer and heart disease by assisting the body in metabolizing bacteria and maintaining a healthy ratio of “good-to-bad” bacteria within the gut, hence reducing overall inflammation (73). Lignans, polyunsaturated fatty acids, oligosaccharides, plant sterols, and saponins are components found in barley bran that can help fight free radical damage and inflammation. These compounds have mechanistic actions that include binding to and eliminating toxic carcinogens from the body (73).  The synergistic action of barley bran components can aid in the anticancer and immunomodulatory properties of barley bran.",20965fe1-91ad-4b7d-bb59-1da3312ca35d
55,discussion19,"  Conclusion  The present study was performed to evaluate the anticancer and immunomodulatory activities of barley bran. The outcomes revealed that the barley bran can diminish cancer cell viability and boost the immune system. The findings of this study revealed the immunomodulatory activity of barley bran by prompting splenic lymphocytes proliferation, phagocytosis, and pinocytosis. Also, when we tested the bran in vivo, the prevention percentage and the small-scale-produced tumors were a good simulation for the prevention effect of barley bran in reality. The presence of various phytochemicals in barley bran can explain its stimulator effect for the innate and acquired immune system.
