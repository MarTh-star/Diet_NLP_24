0,introduction0,"The large ensemble of bacteria that stably inhabit the distal part of our gastrointestinal tract, namely the gut microbiota (GM), is of vital importance for many physiological functions of our organism, exerting a key role in several biological processes, such as nutrition, immune function, and the regulation of the central nervous system (Neish, 2009; Hooper et al., 2012; Nicholson et al., 2012; Honda and Littman, 2016; Sharon et al., 2016). As a strategic partner of the human holobiont, the GM expands our metabolic potential by adding degradative functions, thus enabling the metabolism of a wide range of complex polysaccharides, otherwise indigestible, including exogenous carbohydrates introduced with diet . Indeed, despite the wide distribution of complex polysaccharides in edible plants (Lattimer and Haub, 2010), our genome is astonishingly poor in genes coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) , i.e.",bf7bc4fb-d276-4dac-8d5f-fae2573b5791
1,introduction1,", enzymes specifically devoted to polysaccharide degradation. Conversely, the gut microbiome (i.e., the cumulative genome of the GM) encodes for a much wider and diversified arsenal of CAZymes (El Kaoutari et al., 2013), allowing for the catabolism of the vast array of complex polysaccharides that reach the colon undigested. These molecules are converted to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), microbial metabolites with multiple roles in human physiology . This inter-kingdom cross-feeding is the basis of the mutualistic relationship we share with our intestinal microbial counterpart, which thus emerges as a key player in the co-metabolism of complex carbohydrates in our gut.",00695f1d-abeb-434c-8e71-b64d063dd075
2,introduction2," In this scenario, the dietary polysaccharides that are metabolically available to gut microbes have been specifically defined as microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) (Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg, 2014) and their abundance in the host diet, and consequently their availability within the gut, has proved to be crucial for microbiota–host homeostasis.  The MAC availability in the host diet is among the aspects that have deeply changed in recent human evolutionary history, with the transition from Paleolithic hunting-gathering to Neolithic rural populations and contemporary Westernized societies (Quercia et al., 2014; Schnorr et al., 2014; Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg, 2014; Obregon-Tito et al., 2015). In particular, along with Westernization, we have witnessed a progressive reduction of the MAC content and diversity in the diet, with the transition to foods high in refined simple sugars. According to Sonnenburg et al.",eba835ac-7a24-47bf-9946-f53edf64aa3b
3,introduction3," (2016), this reduction of dietary MACs forced the progressive impoverishment of the CAZyme repertoire in the human microbiome, compromising the overall metabolic plasticity of the human meta-organism. This was confirmed by gut metagenome studies comparing the CAZyme repertoire between traditional populations consuming high-fiber diets and Western urban citizens, which highlighted a relevant reduction of the microbial CAZyme diversity in the latter (King et al., 2012; Bhattacharya et al., 2015; Rampelli et al., 2015). Such wide GM comparative surveys provided important information on the GM-host co-evolutionary dynamics but they did not allow for a precise discrimination of the impact of individual covariates (e.g., diet, health, medication) on the GM functional repertoire.",f8542878-d063-4ee2-9273-d0e1d7e65478
4,introduction4," Aiming to fill this gap in knowledge, here we compared the imputed CAZyme repertoire from two cohorts of Western urban adults from Italy, overcoming the intrinsic variation of the CAZyme profiles according to geography and ethnicity . In particular, we analyzed the GM structure and metadata from16 healthy subjects following a Mediterranean diet and 40 obese, type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients consuming a high-fat low-MACs diet from two previously published studies . Our findings highlighted the existence of a potentially limited number of well-balanced host–microbe symbiotic configurations, with a possible connection to diet and health status.

5,methods0,"Determination of the Pan-microbiome from Italian Healthy Subjects The publicly available 16S rRNA sequencing data of the fecal samples of 16 Italian healthy subjects from Schnorr et al. (2014) were downloaded from the MG-RAST website1 and taxonomically characterized to the species level using the QIIME pipeline , with blastn as an assignment method and the HMP gastrointestinal 16S rRNA dataset as reference sequences2. The detected species were considered part of the so-called Italian “pan-microbiome,” i.e., the virtual entity gathering the vast majority of bacterial species present in the GM of the Italian population. The assembled reference genomes of these bacterial species were downloaded from the NCBI genome section3. Then, to characterize the CAZyme repertoire of these microorganisms, the CAZyme identification pipeline developed by Soverini et al. (2016) was applied. Briefly, ORFs were extracted from the assembled genomes using FragGeneScan 1.16 (Rho et al.",a23d0790-ea2f-4d69-82b4-5c2df8a47238
6,methods1,", 2010). From the translated ORFs, the CAZyme-coding sequences were detected using the hmmscan tool of the HMMER software package  and the dbCAN CAZyme database . The outputs were further processed by the script hmmscan-parser.sh4, selecting only the ORFs that showed a minimum identity of 30% to the query sequences and an alignment length of at least 100 residues.  Identification of CAZyme Co-abundance Groups within the Italian Pan-microbiome The CAZyme profiles were used to generate CAZy co-abundance groups (CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)s), which were conceived as groups of bacterial species sharing a similar CAZyme profile. In brief, the CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)s were generated by applying hierarchical Ward-linkage clustering based on Spearman correlation coefficients to the abundances of glycosyl-hydrolase (GH) and auxiliary activity (AA) families detected in the bacterial genomes.",45c3247a-bc1c-4c1f-9d15-96d012b02cb8
7,methods2," Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (function “adonis” of the vegan package in R) was used to determine whether CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)s were significantly different from each other. CAZymes were also manually classified for their ability to degrade specific substrates by consulting the publicly available CAZy database5. Specifically, we evaluated the ability to degrade different types of MACs: resistant starch (RS), non-digestible carbohydrates (non digestible carbohydrates (NDC)), non-starch polysaccharides (non starch polysaccharides (NSP)), and mucins/glycoproteins (M/G). When more than one activity was found, we selected the most relevant one, i.e., the one with the highest abundance of genes involved in the degradation of a given substrate.",41f9781d-80c0-4fc7-ae65-c84b3309dc72
8,methods3,"  Assessment of Redundant Patterns of CAZymes in Italian Healthy Subjects and Type 2 Diabetes Patients To explore CAZyme profiles in the Italian population in health and disease, we integrated the dataset used to determine the pan-microbiome with the 16S rRNA sequences of the GM from 40 patients affected by type 2 diabetes . The sequences were downloaded from MG-RAST6 and analyzed using QIIME  and the HMP database, as described above for healthy subjects. The CAZyme profile of each GM was obtained by quantifying the relative abundance of each CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG), as a sum of the relative contribution of component bacterial species. We then grouped the subjects using hierarchical Ward-linkage clustering based on Spearman correlation coefficients. Separation between clusters was tested using the permutational multivariate analysis of variance (function “adonis” of vegan).

10,results0,"The Italian Pan-microbiome from Healthy Adults The analysis of the publicly available 16S rRNA sequences of stool samples from 16 Italian healthy adults (aged 20–40 years, mean 32 years) consuming a standard Mediterranean diet  led to the identification of a total of 98 bacterial species, present at least once in the samples (Supplementary Table S1). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was the most represented species, with an average relative abundance of 11 ± 0.09% (standard deviation of the mean). Eubacterium rectale (7 ± 0.06%), Ruminococcus bromii (6 ± 0.05%), and Bifidobacterium adolescentis (6 ± 0.06%) occurred as co-dominant species.

CAZyme Repertoire in the Bacterial Species of the Italian Pan-microbiome Reference genomes from the bacterial species included in the Italian pan-microbiome were retrieved from the NCBI database, and the respective CAZyme-coding sequences were identified. The number of these sequences varied widely between the pan-microbiome components. In particular, Odoribacter laneus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and F. plautii showed the lowest amounts of CAZyme-coding genes, while Eubacterium biforme, Dialister succinatiphilus, and D.",eb97bffb-a28c-46b2-821d-33f3fd60e3c8
12,results2," formicigenerans the highest (see Supplementary Figure S1 for retrieving the number of CAZyme-coding sequences for each bacterial species).  To identify common patterns of MAC-degrading enzymes among the different species of the Italian pan-microbiome, we determined co-abundance associations between the bacterial CAZyme profiles and then clustered them based on similarity. Four robust CAZy Co-abundance Groups (CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)s) were identified in the Italian pan-microbiome, each one including GM species that share a similar CAZyme profile, describing the pattern of CAZyme variation within the Italian GM species (p-value < 0.001, permutation test with pseudo F ratios). CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)s were named according to the most abundant species in each group as follows: S. variabile (CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)1), E. rectale (CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)2), R. bromii (CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)3), and F.",36656114-a70e-4e66-b4e2-19fd9116a6cf

Interestingly, F. prausnitzii and R. bromii CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)s included species with the highest amount of CAZyme-coding sequences, such as D. succinatiphilus, D. formicigenerans, and E. biforme. On the other hand, CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)1 (S. variabile) and CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)2 (E. rectale) included species with a lower amount of CAZyme genes, such as O. laneus and F. plautii. It is important to note that the bacterial genome size is not predictive of the number of encoded CAZymes (El Kaoutari et al., 2013). For example, Bacteroides oleiciplenus, Bacterioides cellulosilyticus and Bacteroides ovatus, the three species with the largest genome size in the Italian pan-microbiome (Supplementary Figure S1), were found to be included within the S. variabile group and show the lowest richness in the CAZyme repertoire.",c2528c1f-5156-4123-9c51-f083c52f3ce4

Finally, we specifically evaluated the distribution of CAZyme families involved in the degradation of different types of MACs across the four CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)s (Figure 2). According to our findings, E. rectale and F. prausnitzii groups showed the highest number of sequences encoding for CAZymes involved in the degradation of non-digestible carbohydrates and non-starch polysaccharides, while the R. bromii group was the least rich in these enzymatic functions (p-value < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test).",a8f11fbc-527a-4e76-912b-91abc4cc8af2

CAZyme Distribution in the Gut Microbiome of Italian Individuals: Associations with the Diet and Health Status We next explored the variation of CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG) profiles in Italian subjects, also in association with the dietary pattern and health conditions. To this aim, the dataset of analyzed individuals was integrated with publicly available16S rRNA gene sequences from 40 Italian obese patients suffering from type 2 diabetes and consuming a high-fat low-MACs diet .",4b604dee-47af-4d93-9902-f2150d842dc4
17,results7," The addition of these samples did not result in an increase in the size of the Italian pan-microbiome, which still consisted of the previously identified 98 species. To compare the CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG) distribution among individual gut microbiomes, for each CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG), the sum of the abundances of constituent microorganisms was calculated, and the personal profile of CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG) abundance in the GM was computed for each subject. According to a clustering analysis of the individual CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG) abundance profiles, subjects could be clustered into four groups (p-value < 0.001, permutation test with pseudo F ratio), each including individuals that shared a comparable profile of the four CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)s, and therefore potentially a similar carbohydrate-degrading functional pattern.

According to our findings, the bacterial species belonging to the Italian pan-microbiome showed two different types of MAC-degrading profiles, essentially characterized by a high or low content of glycosyl-hydrolase-coding sequences, respectively. As expected, the CAZyme distribution in the various species of the Italian GM was heterogeneous, and the absolute number of CAZymes was independent from the genome size.",a89220e9-9d0f-476f-a2e7-94686d0c0b6b
23,discussion2," However, it should be mentioned that, for each identified species, the analysis of the CAZyme content was performed by using the type strain reference genome deposited in the NCBI database and therefore our classification was blind with respect to the possible strain-level functional variability in the CAZyme profile.

These observations suggest that the Italian pan-microbiome is diversified in at least four patterns of carbohydrate degradation, raising several open questions related to: (i) the major determinants of the co-evolutionary processes underlying this differentiation; (ii) the relative contribution of host genetics, lifestyle and diet as drivers of this functional convergence; (iii) the ultimate connections between the observed CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)s and the host metabolic phenotype.",e61e5a86-fc0d-4952-97db-d1e01679bd9e

Indeed, while CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)4 (F. prausnitzii group) appears to co-exist with all other CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)s, CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)2 (E. rectale group) and the CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)s 1 (S. variabile group)/3 (R. bromii group) are mutually exclusive. Confirming this, none of the CTs showed the simultaneous presence of CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)2 and CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)1 and/or CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)3.

28,discussion7," Although caution is needed in interpreting results, the analysis presented here suggests that a high-fat low-MACs diet, in the context of metabolic deregulation, such as obesity and T2D, could force changes in the GM CTs, supporting the presence of CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)1 (S. variabile group) and/or CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)3 (R. bromii group) to the detriment of CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)2 (E. rectale group). Interestingly, compared to CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)1 and CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)3, the CAZyme Co abundance Group (CCG)2 showed higher levels of enzymes involved in the degradation of non-digestible carbohydrates and non-starch polysaccharides, which are indeed abundant MACs in the Mediterranean dietary regimen.

29,discussion8," Indeed, the steady states CTs 2 and 4, that were generally associated with healthy hosts, seem to be the result of an adaptive microbiome-host co-evolution process, in which the interplay between diet, gut microorganisms and the host can contribute to overall metabolic health. On the contrary, the CTs 1 and 3 that were associated with T2D and a high-fat low-MACs diet, may result from a maladaptive microbiome–host process, in which this type of diet has led to the selection of CT steady states able to contribute to metabolic and/or immunological deregulation. Supporting these hypotheses, patients suffering from Behcet’s syndrome, a systemic inflammatory condition, showed a specific GM functional dysbiosis accompanied by a decreased production of SCFAs .",ea6be0fb-640b-4aeb-8c20-cf7896eaec8d
30,discussion9," Although the CAZyme profile has not yet been explored in patients with this disease, we can speculate that the observed reduction in SCFA biosynthesis could be the result of a maladaptive transition to CT1 or CT3, which would diminish the GM potential to provide the host with essential metabolites, such as butyrate, crucial to support immunological health.  Conclusion Our findings highlighted the existence of specific and well-defined GM functional layouts (CAZyTypes, CTs) for what concerns the ecosystem capacity to metabolize MACs, and support the hypothesis that the human GM has the ability to reconfigure its own CAZyme functional layout in response to dietary changes, with possible implications for the host health and metabolic regulation.
