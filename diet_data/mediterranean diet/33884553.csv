0,methods0, 2.1. Ethical Considerations  The project was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the San Carlos Clinical Hospital in Madrid and followed the ethical principles set out in the World Medical Association’s Helsinki Declaration [20]. Informed consent was obtained from each participant.  2.2. Participants and Data Collection  A general call for participation in the study was made to the members of the Spanish Professional Association of Commercial Aviation Pilots (COPAC) and the Spanish Union of Airline pilots (Spanish Union of Airline pilots (SEPLA)). Pilots who wanted to voluntarily participate were evaluated in the period between October 2019 and February 2020. Only pilots of commercial aircraft in active service who had passed the last medical check-up were included. A total of 304 male pilots aged between 24 and 64 years were analyzed. Women were not considered because the sample was too small.,9bebbb1c-c4e4-45c1-b9bb-baaa66d9b361
1,methods1," The personal interview consisted of questions related to the pilots’ professional history. Pilots were classified in two types according to the distance traveled. Long-haul pilots, those that work on transcontinental flights, and short-haul or medium/short-haul pilots.  2.3. Anthropometry and Bioimpedance  Height (cm), weight (kg) and waist circumference (WC)(cm) were collected according to the International Biological Program [21]. The body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were calculated. To assess the nutritional status, the body mass index (BMI) was classified following the World Health Organization criteria [22]. Central obesity was determined when the WHtR was ≥0.5 according to Hsieh and Muto [23]. Body fat percentage (BF%) was analyzed using electric tetrapolar bioimpedance (Tanita BC558) and classified according to Gallagher et al. [24].  2.4.",3ef0de7e-3955-4cf2-bf34-df4e68f34a47
2,methods2," Physiometabolic Parameters and the Atherogenic Risk  The data on blood concentration of glucose (mg/dL), total cholesterol (mg/dL), HDL cholesterol (mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (mg/dL) and triglycerides (mg/dL) were collected from the most recent clinical analysis provided by the participants. Although blood pressure could not be measured in situ, each participant was asked whether they had hypertension and/or took medication to control it. The guidelines of the International Diabetes Federation (International Diabetes Federation (IDF)) [25] were followed to establish hyperglycemia (>100 mg/dL) and hypertriglyceridemia (≥150 mg/dL). Hypercholesterolemia (≥200 mg/dL), HDL cholesterol (abnormal level for men < 35 mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol (normal-high: >100 and <160 mg/dL and high: >160 mg/dL) was classified following the Spanish Heart Foundation criteria [26]. The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) was calculated using the formula proposed by Frohlich and Dobiasova [27] (log10 (TG/HDL-C)).",bb944d3e-436a-4d29-83e7-86631d8a0e61
3,methods3," The cut-off points considered were low cardiovascular risk when atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is ≤0.11; medium: ≥0.12 and ≤0.21 and high: >0.21 [28].  2.5. Lifestyle Factors  To measure adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), we administered the 14-item PREDIMED questionnaire [29], and the total score was classified as: low adherence, 0–7 points; medium adherence, 8–10; high adherence, ≥11. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) was used to gather information on physical activity [30]. This instrument allows the classification of the daily activity into three intensity categories (low, moderate, vigorous). To calculate the metabolic equivalents (metabolic equivalents (MET)), each type of activity was associated with a value multiplied by the days and minutes reported for that activity.",7f44908f-72c4-4655-8439-cad54589bcd2
4,methods4," Using the metabolic equivalents (MET), the total physical activity was classified as low (<600 metabolic equivalents (MET)), moderate (600 to 3000 metabolic equivalents (MET)), or high (>3000 metabolic equivalents (MET)) [31]. The sedentary level was the time in hours spent sitting during a working day.  2.6. Statistical Analyses  The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to examine normality. To compare means between groups, a one-way ANOVA was applied with a Bonferroni-adjusted post hoc pairwise two-sided test to avoid type I error. To compare the nonparametric variables, the Mann–Whitney U test was applied. When the differences between groups yielded differences with a p-value less than 0.05, they were considered statistically significant. The medians, 25th, 75th percentiles, maximum and minimum values of each continuous variable with respect to the risk levels calculated for the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) were represented by boxplots.",dde7fb2a-8301-4ba7-aae3-3a48e9de95ea
5,methods6,"48, Mann–Whitney U: 65,000.00, p < 0.001).  3.2. Anthropometry and Bioimpedance  More than half of the sample (53.6%) presented excess weight, 47.2% being overweight and 6.4% having obesity. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.57 ± 3.09 kg/m2. The mean WC was 92.19 ± 10.73, and regarding the WHtR, the sample mean was 0.521 ± 0.057. A substantial proportion of the pilots presented abdominal obesity, according to the WHtR (64.6%), and the mean BF% was 23.83 ± 6.58, with 64.3% of high relative adiposity. Table 1 shows the comparative analysis of the anthropometric profile and the relative adiposity according to flight type. There were no significant differences between short/medium and long-haul pilots on any direct or derived anthropometric measures or for the BF%.  3.3. Physiometabolic Parameters and Atherogenic Index of Plasma  The self-reported high blood pressure rate was 10% for the total sample, affecting 6.9% of the short/medium-haul pilots and 13.",10b1bf89-cea5-4365-a719-d22ac94df0c7
6,methods7,"3% of the long-haul group (chi-square: 3.34; p < 0.05). The most prevalent altered metabolic parameter was total cholesterol, with 42.6% of pilots exceeding the upper limit of 200 mg/dL recommended by the Fundación Española del Corazón (FEC)23. The prevalence of LDL cholesterol above 160 mg/dL was 9.4% and HDL cholesterol under 35 mg/dL showed a rate of 10.6%. The percentage of pilots with hyperglycemia was 9.4% and with hypertriglyceridemia, 8.1%. The mean atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) for the total sample was 0.178 ± 0.253. Regarding the prevalence of the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) risk, it was low for 38.5%, 15.4% presented an intermediate risk and 46.2% a high risk. There were no significant differences between the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) averages according to the type of flight. Table 2 presents the mean values for the metabolic variables showing no significant differences for any of these parameters according to the type of flight.  3.4.",b90d4db4-f48d-44c4-acf2-2e88e1e6074c
7,methods8," Adherence to Mediterranean Diet  The mean score on the PREDIMED questionnaire was 9.49 ± 1.94, with no difference between flight types. In our sample, 14.7% of the pilots presented low adherence, 55.6% medium adherence and 29.7% high adherence. An analysis of each item on the questionnaire revealed that the lowest scores were in item 9 (“How many servings of legumes do you consume per week?”), item 4 (“How many fruit units (including natural fruit juices) do you consume per day?”) and item 10 (“How many servings of fish or shellfish do you consume per week?”). The item 1 was the one that obtained the highest score.  3.5. Physical Activity and Sedentarism  The reported level of physical activity was low in 4.4% of the pilots, moderate in 38.2% and high in 57.3%.",b41cf317-ef33-41e8-b9ea-65501434c56b
8,methods9," No differences were found for the metabolic equivalents (MET) expanded in the different types of activities between the pilots according to flight type, but we found significant differences in the hours spent sitting on a working day, which was higher in long-haul pilots with more than two hours apart on average (Table 3).  3.6. atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) Interaction with Age, Cardiometabolic Profile and Lifestyle Factors  The age of pilots did not show significant differences when comparing the three atherogenic risk categories (F: 0.364, p = 0.695). No differences were detected between the prevalence of arterial hypertension (chi-square: 0.462, p = 0.794). As shown in Figure 1, the mean values for the anthropometric indicators of obesity increased as a function of the risk category established for the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) (body mass index (BMI): F: 8.35, p < 0.001; WHtR: F: 7.70, p < 0.001; %BF: F: 4.54, p < 0.05).",29f32c6e-0ae2-42fa-aa7b-05e35ccaa913
9,methods10," In all three indicators, the Bonferroni post hoc test showed differences between low- and high-risk categories (body mass index (BMI) mean difference (MD): −2.23, p < 0.001; WHtR MD: −0.40, p < 0.001; %BF MD: −4.75, p < 0.05). Figure 2 shows the association between serum metabolic levels and risk categories for atherogenic index of plasma (AIP). Only the LDL cholesterol levels were significantly increased between the lowest to highest atherogenic risk categories (F: 8.60, p < 0.001; Bonferroni test: MD: −20.11, p < 0.001). As shown in Figure 3, there was an inverse relationship between the MedDiet adherence score and the risk of atherogenicity (Mann–Whitney U: 1301.50; p < 0.05). On the other hand, the average metabolic equivalents (MET)s expended was higher in the low-risk atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) category than the high-risk category (F: 7.302, p < 0.001, Bonferroni test: MD: 1620.61, p < 0.001).",4ba70556-d6ee-40bf-93d6-954d75d5ed9b
10,methods11," Figure 3 also shows that there was no association between the number of hours sitting and the atherogenic risk category.  4. Discussion  The present work analyzed various aspects of lifestyle and health in a sample of Spanish aviation pilots, a group of professionals that had been barely studied from this perspective. In this study, no significant differences were found for any anthropometric, physiometabolic, MedDiet adherence, or physical activity parameters according to the type of flight. Therefore, no distinction can be made in the cardiovascular risk profile between the two groups. Although significant differences were found in the time spent sitting, being greater among those who flew long-haul flights, no association was found with atherogenic index of plasma (AIP).  Excess weight, particularly abdominal obesity, has been associated with some chronic diseases, of which cardiovascular disorders are predominant, as well as diabetes and certain types of cancer.",57673c3c-e472-4c4c-a7dd-68190f13d06c
11,methods12," Moreover, it contributes to a reduced quality of life and life expectancy [32,33]. The total excess weight in pilots presented a rate practically identical to that reported for the general population in Spain (53.9%), in a comparative study among European countries [34]. However, the prevalence of obesity reported in that study (17.1%) was three times higher than in the current study.  Compared to other professionals, the mean body mass index (BMI) of Spanish pilots was similar to that found in 354 pilots of Swedish airlines (body mass index (BMI): 25.2 kg/m2). Moreover, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was comparable, 41% and 4%, respectively [35]. A similar overweight prevalence was found in a study that collected 8588 examinations for the licensing of UK pilots (46.8%), however, the obesity was twice as high (12.4%) [36]. Regarding the WHtR, the mean in this sample was more favorable than in 2913 men from the Canary Islands [37].",6f620c07-f2cc-422c-847d-5554efe32db5
12,methods13," It is important to highlight that this index has been a useful parameter in detecting different components associated with cardiovascular risk; in fact, it has been observed that individuals with a body mass index (BMI) below 30 kg/m2 may have excess abdominal fat and therefore be candidates for cardiometabolic risk [38]. Furthermore, the visceral fat depot has a worse prognosis of cardiovascular and type-2 diabetes morbidity than general obesity [39,40] and is highly associated with atherogenicity [27,41,42,43].  One of the critical risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is hypertension; therefore, prevention is fundamental during the development of the pilot’s career. The prevalence of hypertension in this sample was remarkably low (10%), compared to the Spanish general population in a study where the prevalence was 26.7% in men [44]. Likewise, hypertension were almost three times higher in the study of cardiovascular risk factors in the UK (28.7%) [36].",689c6daf-27dd-4c19-9253-5b9afdf0ee6e
13,methods14," However, an analysis of Colombian pilots reported a lower prevalence for this physiological parameter (7.8%) [45]. Dyslipidemia is characterized by alterations in the concentration of lipids/lipoproteins which are closely related to atherosclerosis development [46]. The prevalence of a high total cholesterol was lower than in the ENRICA study (50.5%) [47], but no less worrying, given that it affected 42.6% of the pilots. However, comparing it with a study conducted in 216,914 Spanish workers, all lipid parameters were lower, especially the high LDL cholesterol (9.4% vs. 19.3%) and low HDL cholesterol (10.6% vs. 24.9%), but also high total cholesterol (42.6% vs. 48.7%) and high blood triglyceride level (8.1% vs. 10.8%), showing that the cardiovascular risk was elevated generally, but mainly in certain types of employments [48]. Similarly, hyperglycemia was slightly lower here (9.",cb0d63f3-021e-480b-8072-587bfb52fefa
14,methods15,"4%), compared with the values reflected in a review of different studies, where the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was estimated between 10 and 15% [49]. In addition, the Di@bet.es study found that the overall prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 13.8% [50]. Likewise, the prevalence was almost twice less than that observed in 5226 Spanish adults attending dietary consultations (15%) [51]. Regarding hypertriglyceridemia, in the aforementioned study, the proportion of men with this pathology was 14.9%, almost double that observed in the present study (8.1%).  The literature has shown that a MedDiet helps avoid metabolic syndrome and prevents various cardiovascular events, decreasing mortality-related risk [52,53]. One of the critical elements of a MedDiet is extra virgin olive oil, which has anti-inflammatory properties, among others [54]. The PREDIMED studies have conclusively shown that greater adherence to a MedDiet protects against cardiovascular disease [53].",a7360724-e2cf-4a13-921e-7e18a5820f85
15,methods16," The assessment of MedDiet adherence in university students in Murcia showed a need to increase the intake of fruit, vegetables and legumes, these items scoring the lowest, as in this study [55]. In the PREDIMED study involving 7447 participants, the mean score was 8.7 ± 2.0 for men, lower than the one reported here. Moreover, they found an inverse relationship between adherence to MedDiet and obesity indices such as %BF or WHtR [29]. Regarding physical activity, both groups of pilots reported a greater total physical activity than that reported in the general population. For example, in a sample for the Di@bet.es study, sedentariness exceeded 30%. Furthermore, the total physical activity was considerably lower than in this sample [56]. In addition, another study carried out in 20 countries found that, in the Spanish sample, the rate of low-intensity physical activity was 24.2%, medium 36.2%, and high 39.",8ebc4be9-9ca8-40de-baf1-fb6b16aea386
16,methods17,"6% [57], while in our sample, the rate of low-intensity physical activity was substantially lower and there was a greater prevalence of moderate-intensity and vigorous physical activity.  The association of atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) with other factors showed that the higher the body mass index (BMI), WHtR or BF%, the higher risk of atherogenic index of plasma (AIP). Similarly, a cross-sectional study with 1000 participants found that atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) was significantly correlated with WC, a higher body mass index (BMI), and a lower level of physical activity, proposing the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) as a marker of cardiovascular disease [58].",ec063c63-dbba-4b11-8ed5-1ea2df3cb7d4
17,methods18," Another study analyzed the association between factors related to cardiovascular diseases, such as body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol and fasting blood glucose, showing that atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) increased as these parameters increased, with the most robust correlations between atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) and body mass index (BMI) and total cholesterol. As expected, atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) was found to be significantly lower in the group that engaged in regular physical activity [41]. The participants with the poorest cardiovascular health status were found to have a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis [41]. Another longitudinal study determined the association of atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) with cardiometabolic disorders.",d7dcd4a6-f24a-4f86-812b-eb1c2b14cd3b
18,methods19," Among men, they found that insulin levels, obesity and cholesterol were the main determinants, and higher quartiles of atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) significantly predicted coronary heart disease, diabetes and hypertension [59]. In another sample of 2701 adults, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was independently related to the likelihood of having an elevated atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), with this relationship being mediated by central adiposity [60]. In the present study, the pilots who engaged in the highest level of physical activity had a lower prevalence of elevated atherogenic index of plasma (AIP). This relationship was not so evident in the case of moderate exercise. Nonetheless, the anthropometric parameters associated with central adiposity also suggested a lower risk of high atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) when such parameters were below the established cut-off points for the obesity condition.",4181223a-43ec-4fe6-bad0-f01f54795e37
19,methods20," Regarding dietary patterns, our findings suggest that the greater the adherence to a MedDiet, the lower the risk of atherogenic index of plasma (AIP).  The results showed that the related cardiovascular factors of pilots are comparatively better than in the general Spanish population. However, further attention and prevention should be paid to this group, especially since their work is highly demanding. Additionally, the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) could be considered a cardiovascular risk biomarker among pilots. Likewise, we highlight the importance of promoting healthy lifestyle habits to prevent excess weight or abdominal obesity to improve cardiovascular status.  The present study is not without limitations, one of which is the small sample size, so the results cannot be extrapolated to the entire professional group. Nonetheless, we collected data on numerous variables for each participant, serving to enrich the study.",dc0fd404-1f09-437f-863b-614653bdc3e8
20,methods21," As the participation was voluntary, the data may be partially biased, with individuals more concerned about their health the most willing to attend interviews. Likewise, the time elapsed between the blood test performed in a laboratory as part of the last medical check-up and the rest of the parameters analyzed in the study may vary among participants, never exceeding eleven months. In that period, changes in habits could have occurred. Drug consumption was not recorded, so there could be cases of normal biochemical profile but pharmacologically controlled. Furthermore, the precise data on blood pressure were not included in the clinical reports and therefore, its association with atherogenic risk and lifestyle factors could not be analyzed. However, the study has several strengths, such as using personal interviews, collecting anthropometric data in situ and gathering data from reliable clinical sources.  5.",f55be15a-85ca-4f98-a396-2bad4382c1b2
21,methods22," Conclusions  This study provides unprecedented data on the anthropometric, atherogenic and lifestyle profile of Spanish aviation pilots. These professionals presented lower levels of hypertension, hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, a greater adherence to a MedDiet and a higher level of physical activity than the general Spanish population. However, they presented worrying rates of overweight, abdominal obesity and hypercholesterolemia contributing to an atherogenic risk. The results showed that atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) could be an effective and simple biomarker to monitor cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this professional group. The results obtained may help design specific prevention plans focused on reducing excess adipose and the reduction of blood cholesterol levels, the main predisposing factors to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Spanish aviation pilots.",76c2c866-4d66-4a67-8a3b-2f602b833c5b
22,methods23, It is crucial to continue research in this direction to safeguard the health of pilots during their careers and ensure flight safety. ,2b988453-6a3c-429b-a90e-bbc3592ce169
