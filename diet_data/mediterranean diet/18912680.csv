0,introduction0,"The metabolic syndrome is a combination of metabolic disorders, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, compensatory hyperinsulinemia and the tendency to develop fat around the abdomen [1]. People with metabolic syndrome are at high risk for atherosclerosis and, consequently, cardiovascular disease.  Alanine aminotranferase (aminotranferase (ALT)), aspartate aminotransferase (aminotransferase (AST)) and gamma -glutamyltransferase (γGT) are common markers of liver injury. Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) constitutes the most frequent explanation for abnormal liver tests results and accounts for asymptomatic elevation of aminotransferase levels in up to 90% of cases.",68c09928-2154-4431-8485-a9ee6c5edec6
1,introduction1," [2,3] It is proposed that Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be part of a wider coexistence of features, besides the core set of disorders which characterize the metabolic syndrome and liver enzymes-Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated biomarkers have indeed been correlated with metabolic syndrome, its components and cardiovascular disease. [4-8] Among the different liver enzymes, aminotranferase (ALT) has been related with hepatic fat deposition and insulin resistance which plays a major role in metabolic syndrome.",d2e7d17c-95a9-4038-b610-b203d4f9a9b3
2,introduction2," [9] In cases where aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) ratio has been used instead of aminotranferase (ALT), it has been found that this ratio is also correlated with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance [10,11] aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) ratio could be useful for distinguishing the etiology and severity of different liver damage as a value >2 may indicate advanced alcohol liver disease and on the other hand, aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) <1 may imply fat liver accumulation and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). [12-14] Nevertheless, the exact role of aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) ratio in assessing metabolic syndrome is unclear.  Previous data from the ATTICA and other studies have shown that Mediterranean diet is related with lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome. [15,16] However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.",1cf8fce2-076c-41f3-a123-fdad89ff3045
3,introduction3," Ôhe effect of this type of diet on liver enzymes and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is barely explored, so it is not yet investigated such a possible mediator for the effect of Mediterranean diet to the presence of the metabolic syndrome. [17] Therefore, the goal of the present work was to evaluate whether serum circulating liver markers, like γ-GT, aminotransferase (AST), aminotranferase (ALT) and aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) ratio are associated with the presence of the metabolic syndrome, in a Greek adult population, free from cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, we sought to investigate whether adherence to the Mediterranean diet plays a role in the relationship of circulating liver markers with metabolic syndrome.

5,methods0,"Participants of the study The ATTICA study is a health and nutrition survey, which is being carried out in the province of Attica (including 78% urban and 22% rural areas), where Athens, is a major metropolis. [18] The sampling was random, multistage and based on the age-sex distribution of the province of Attica provided by the National Statistical Service (census of 2001). The sampling anticipated enrolling only people without any clinical history of cardiovascular disease or any other atherosclerotic disease. People who reported chronic viral hepatitis or other known cause of chronic liver disease were excluded from the study. Participants did not have cold or flu, acute respiratory infection, dental problems or any type of surgery during the past weeks. From May 2001 to December 2002, 4056 inhabitants from the above area were randomly selected and of them, 3042 agreed to participate (75% participation rate); 1514 males (18–87 years) and 1528 females (18–89 years).",b3056982-0bec-48e4-a1fa-4cbbcea9dca9

All participants were interviewed by trained personnel who used a standard questionnaire that evaluated lifestyle habits and various socio-demographic, clinical and biological characteristics. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our Institution and was carried in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki (1989) of the World Medical Association.  Dietary assessment Consumption of non-refined cereals and products, vegetables, legumes, fruits, olive oil, dairy products, fish, pulses, nuts, potatoes, eggs, sweets, poultry, red meat and meat products were measured as an average per week during the past year through a validated food-frequency questionnaire (the EPIC-Greek) [19].",547b8595-17a5-4c53-a245-7a1e2d081ab5
7,methods2," The frequency of consumption was then quantified approximately in terms of the number of times a month a food was consumed. Alcohol consumption was measured by daily ethanol intake, in wineglasses (100 ml and 12% ethanol concentration). The Mediterranean dietary pattern [20] consists of: (a) daily consumption: of non refined cereals and products (whole grain bread, pasta, brown rice, etc), vegetables (2 – 3 servings/day), fruits (6 servings/day), olive oil (as the main added lipid) and dairy products (1 – 2 servings/day), (b) weekly consumption: of fish (4–5 servings/week), poultry (3 – 4 servings/week), olives, pulses, and nuts (3 servings/week), potatoes, eggs and sweets (3 – 4 servings/week) and monthly consumption: of red meat and meat products (4 – 5 servings/month).

8,methods3," To evaluate the level of adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern a special diet score was used, the MedDietScore [21]; the score has been found reliable, repeatable and valid, in previous works [22]. In particular, for the consumption of food items that are close to this dietary pattern we assigned score 0 for rare or no consumption, 1 for 1 to 4 times/month, 2 for 5 to 8 times, 3 for 9 to 12 times/month, 4 for 13 to 18 times/month and 5 for almost daily consumption. On the other hand, for the consumption of foods that are away from this traditional diet, like meat and meat products, we assigned the opposite scores (i.e. 0 for almost daily consumption to 5 for rare or no consumption). For alcohol, we assigned score 5 for consumption of less than 3 wineglasses/day and, progressively, score 0 for consumption of more than 7 wineglasses/day. Thus, the range of the diet score is between 0 – 55.",2db9d526-562f-49c9-822f-0aa20e749f6d

Moreover, only aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) ratio and not aminotransferase (AST), aminotranferase (ALT) or γ-GT, was a marker of the syndrome when dietary habits of people were taken into account, denoting that aminotransferases concentrations should be considered together when evaluating the development of the metabolic syndrome.",cb67af83-0f5b-4be3-a123-cb7731960cfd

Why aminotransferase (AST) behaves differently than aminotranferase (ALT) so the ratio becomes important is not clarified; nevertheless, there are some physiological differences that may explain it. aminotranferase (ALT) has low concentrations in skeletal muscle and kidneys, so it is more specific for liver damage than aminotransferase (AST) that is diffusely represented in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain and red blood cells.",c67b196a-e510-4ea0-ae71-f6abbcad1da7
27,discussion3," aminotranferase (ALT) and aminotransferase (AST) both require pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (vitamin B6) in order to carry out the reaction of transfer of α-amino groups from aspartate and alanine to the α-keto group of ketoglutaric acid but pyridoxal-5'-phosphate affects more aminotranferase (ALT). Finally, from observational studies aminotranferase (ALT) seems to correlate more with insulin resistance but the nature of this connection need to be elucidated [28,29]. The associations of aminotransferases levels with the metabolic syndrome or its constituents have already been reported [30,31]. Particularly, insulin resistance study show that liver enzymes may predict metabolic syndrome and additionally, that not only aminotranferase (ALT) but aminotransferase ratio also may be used as a marker for metabolic syndrome [11].",db4776a8-7c50-4bc0-9cc8-f851a6e3db86
28,discussion4," Liver enzymes and the related pathology of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are associated with metabolic syndrome through many metabolic disorders like overweight and obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes and hypertension, while insulin resistance is now considered the main link between metabolic disturbances and elevated liver enzymes [30-33]. Nevertheless, our study has revealed an association of metabolic syndrome only with aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) ratio and not also with specific liver enzymes, as the abovementioned studies. Regarding γGT, although it was not correlated with metabolic syndrome as a biniary entity, a trend analysis has shown that it is related with the number of metabolic components and this is in agreement with previous studies [8,31]. The majority of preceding related studies found no relationship between aminotransferase (AST) and metabolic disorders.",857172be-5707-4a85-9064-52a8610b5b75
29,discussion5," However, most of these studies have positively correlated aminotranferase (ALT) with metabolic syndrome; on the other side, in our study, men had considerably low levels of aminotranferase (ALT) (below the cut-off of 30 IU/L for men) in both groups -those with and those without metabolic syndrome [34,35]. In women, the insignificant difference of aminotranferase (ALT) levels between those with and without the metabolic syndrome may be partially explained by the vast distribution of aminotranferase (ALT). Moreover, because of the good level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet of the studied women and the protective effect of this diet to various metabolic abnormalities (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes), one can speculate that the burden of the metabolic syndrome in our female sample has a more ""benign"" profile compared with other populations.",84c0fb10-3860-41ed-87e2-aa739ea0fdb4
30,discussion6,"  Indeed, the favourable effect of Mediterranean diet to the metabolic syndrome has been demonstrated by a number of studies, including ATTICA [15,16,36]. However, it is not lucid if Mediterranean diet could have as well, a beneficial role to -metabolic syndrome related- liver fat accumulation and relative biomarkers. It is well-known that by managing obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes mellitus and by moderating alcohol consumption, liver fat may be prevented or minimized. Interventions like drugs, diet and exercise, that reduce insulin resistance, may decrease the amount of fat in the liver and normalize aminotransferase levels [37-39]. As Mediterranean diet is related with less insulin resistance, one can assume that such a diet could improve liver fat and enzymes [40].",e264e3bc-778a-4c3d-9578-5ac4062b704c
31,discussion7," Our study has established a relationship between Mediterranean diet and aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) ratio, apart from alcohol consumption and other potential confounders but further enquiry will show if insulin resistance is the basic mediator of this relation. The reason why aminotransferase (AST) elevation occurs independently than aminotranferase (ALT) elevation when someone has a great adherence to the Mediterranean diet is not clear but maybe it is due to the abovementioned differences of aminotransferase functions [28].  Furthermore, additional investigation is needed in order to comprehend how Mediterranean diet affects the relation of aminotransferase ratio with metabolic syndrome. A number of underlying mechanisms may interpret the phenomenon of the dissociation of the abovementioned parameters.",426c092d-488f-4ab0-93c4-bab8116885bf
32,discussion8," It is already mentioned that aminotranferase (ALT) and aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) are markers closely related to pathology of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), meaning with liver fat storage [9]. Adherence to Mediterranean diet may well be capable of protecting from building up more liver fat, even in people with metabolic syndrome or when the probability of having the metabolic syndrome increases. It is possible, that this type of diet reduces the effect on the liver, of cytokines and adipokines secreted from the extra adipose tissue. These mediators could affect the transcriptional factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) of hepatocytes, meaning the regulators of mitochondrial fatty oxidation and liver fat synthesis [41].",1be80885-9684-4982-94ac-93ca91cbb07c
33,discussion9," Furthermore, aminotranferase (ALT) and aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) are markers of insulin resistance and ""ATTICA"" and other studies have already shown that Mediterranean diet is associated with lower levels of insulin resistance and this can be true also in people with metabolic syndrome [36,40]. Moreover, hypoadiponectinemia which characterizes metabolic syndrome and its components and seems to correlate also with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), may be altered by a Mediterranean diet. In fact, there are indications that levels of adiponectin are related with this type of diet. [42]  On the other hand, Mediterranean diet could minimize the contribution of hepatic inflammation secondary to liver steatosis, to the low-grade inflammation associated with the metabolic syndrome, by reducing, for example, the hepatic production of tumor necrosis factor-α, which triggers the production of other cytokines [43].",e0354e2d-87b6-4112-8e73-5eb732a20d9d
34,discussion10," By turning down the inflammatory and oxidative processes, Mediterranean diet may also lessen the -derived from liver lipid storage- hepatic insulin resistance and the raise of endogenous glucose production, which in turn may accompany metabolic syndrome. Moreover, specific insulin pathway signalling events are altered in the adipose tissue of patients with NASH compared with non-progressive forms of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [44]. So, in case of a great adherence to Mediterranean diet, other factors apart from liver fat storage must be recognized as responsible for metabolic syndrome.  The possible advantageous quality of Mediterranean diet to aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) ratio and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) should be further investigated by intervention studies. Additionally, the underlying mechanisms by which this type of diet modifies the relationship of aminotransferases ratio with metabolic syndrome need to be elucidated.",248ed0fd-3029-4426-a37b-f34d030377c0
35,discussion11,"  Limitations This is a cross-sectional study, so it could not establish causal relationships, but only states hypotheses about the link between liver enzymes and aminotransferase ratio with metabolic syndrome and Mediterranean diet. In discussion, elevated liver enzymes and low aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) ratio were utilized as an estimate of liver fat accumulation, assuming that most cases are markers for Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). By excluding people with HBsAg+ or anti-HCV, this estimation is even more accurate and this is another limitation of our study, that participants did not underwent these measures.",b95c07d6-f7df-4c73-b23a-9e323748a8b4
36,discussion12," Although Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is ideally diagnosed by liver biopsy, histological and ultrasonographic studies of patients referred for unexplained aminotransferase elevations indicate that fatty infiltration of the liver is the cause in 90% of cases and on top, the use of liver enzymes as Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) markers is a common methodology in epidemiological cross – sectional surveys, and therefore, our results are comparable. [5,11] Although aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) ratio is inversely linked with liver fat, in a small percentage of asymptomatic subjects, it is also correlated with more severe liver damage and fibrosis, so, the true cause of liver enzyme elevations and the significance of aminotransferase ratio, in the study participants cannot be determined with certainty.",85790832-b0e6-4e84-a344-3b7366edcdcd
37,discussion13," Nevertheless, in our study the mean aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) ratio was <2 for people with but also without metabolic syndrome, while severe liver damage (from alcohol) is related with values >2 [13].  Conclusion Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is positively correlated with aminotransferase (AST)/aminotranferase (ALT) ratio and should be further examined for its favorable impact to non alcoholic fat liver disease. Furthermore, this type of diet modifies the relationship of the liver enzymes ratio with metabolic syndrome; hence in people with a great adherence in Mediterranean diet, alterations in liver enzymes do not affect the likelihood of having metabolic syndrome and vice versa.",620cc97a-27f6-4a87-a52d-059d6aa65a8e
38,discussion14," Our findings pose the need for further investigation on whether Mediterranean diet may have a positive effect in liver biochemistry and liver fat accumulation by moderating metabolic syndrome related mechanisms or its beneficial role to metabolic syndrome could partially be explained by its consequences to liver fat and associated biomarkers.
