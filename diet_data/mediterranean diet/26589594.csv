0,background0,"Overwhelming evidence demonstrates that even modest fish consumption (1–2 servings per week) has extensive health benefits, particularly for cardiovascular health. A recent systematic review reported that this relatively low level of fish consumption was associated with a 36% decreased risk of fatal coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) and a 17% decreased risk of total mortality compared to <1 serving/week of fish consumption. Health benefits of modest but regular fish consumption occur within only months, but greater benefits occur with longer duration of intake. Oily fish (e.g., salmon, herring, sardines) may be especially beneficial, as they are relatively higher in two long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) and docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)). eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been identified as the active constituents for cardiovascular benefits [1].",2461b933-92d2-4966-ba83-51a7867a710e
1,background1," Furthermore, in many western societies it is likely that fish consumption displaces and thus reduces consumption of red and processed meat, and this reduction is associated with many health benefits [2–10].  Despite these health benefits of fish intake, there is concern about the potential adverse effects of mercury from fish; fish is a major source of mercury [11], which, at extremely high levels, has been shown to result in serious health complications including cardiovascular disease [1]. Several studies investigating the relationship between fish intake, mercury exposure and cardiovascular disease in adults have generated inconsistent results [12–19]. As a result, government agencies and health organizations have identified mercury exposure from fish consumption as an area needing further investigation [1, 20–23].",d5a52232-d84e-43c9-9553-a51a41aea24a
2,background2," The present study seeks to clarify whether current Mediterranean diet recommendations of fish consumption (1–2 servings of fish per week), elevate mercury exposure to levels that increase risk of cardiovascular disease.  Extensive evidence supports that toenail concentration of methylmercury is an excellent biomarker for long-term mercury exposure [24–29]. A nested case-control study in the United States of 3427 cardiovascular disease cases and 3427 matched controls assessed mercury exposure by measuring toenail mercury concentration. They found no adverse effects of mercury exposure on coronary heart disease, stroke or total cardiovascular disease [11]. Another analysis using the same data found no adverse effects of mercury exposure on hypertension. This was true for levels 2.5-fold higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reference dose [30].",8cb9bd5b-99d3-484b-90d2-099dc1a52a06
3,background3,"  A 2012 review of mercury exposure and human health concluded that there is no clear relationship between mercury exposure and cardiovascular disease [31]. Thus, further evidence is needed before altering any policies or recommendations regarding mercury exposure through fish intake.

The Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea (PREDIMED) trial was a randomized, controlled, cardiovascular disease prevention trial based in 11 centers throughout Spain [35]. Institutional Review Boards at all participating centers approved the study protocol.  Eligible participants included men (55–80 year) and women (60–80 year) at high risk for developing cardiovascular disease at enrollment, but had never been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. High risk was defined as having type 2 diabetes mellitus or at least three of the following major risk factors: current smoking, hypertension, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, overweight or obesity or a familial history of premature coronary heart disease. 7447 participants were recruited between 2003 and 2009.",1fef784a-5760-426f-ba6d-732b5cd38c0f

The primary cardiovascular disease endpoint was defined as non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death. Hojiblanca and Patrimonio Communal Olivarero donated extra-virgin olive oil; the California Walnut Commission donated walnuts; Borges donated almonds; La Morella Nuts donated hazelnuts. Sponsors played no role in the design, analysis, interpretation or manuscript writing.  To evaluate the association between fish consumption, mercury exposure and cardiovascular disease, we designed a nested case-control study within the framework of the Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea (PREDIMED) trial.

The median follow-up period from time of toenail sampling to time of incident cardiovascular disease was 4.8 years (interquartile range 3.0–5.8 years). Outcomes were identified through repeated contacts with participants, contacts with family physicians, annual medical record review and consultation of the National Death Index. The End-Point Adjudication Committee was blinded to the randomized intervention group and every exposure, and ascertained outcomes.

We used this information to calculate average fish consumption (in grams per day).  Covariate assessment Covariates were measured at baseline and yearly over follow-up. We reviewed medical records and used standardized validated protocols [39] to collect information on sociodemographic, lifestyle, health, family history and medical diagnoses. A validated Spanish version of the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire [40] was used to evaluate physical activity.

12,analysis0,"To examine the association of toenail mercury concentration with cardiovascular disease in the nested case-control study’s total population, we used multivariate-adjusted conditional logistic regression, matching on age and sex. For separate analyses of the intervention groups or control group, we used multivariate-adjusted unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for matching factors. Mercury concentrations (μg/g) were categorized into quartiles based on the distribution among controls. To test for trend, we used the median value of the appropriate quartile of mercury and treated it as a continuous variable.  We again used multivariate-adjusted conditional logistic regression to evaluate mercury exposure in conjunction with fish consumption in the total nested case-control study.

28,discussion2," The lack of association after restricting to participants at very high risk of cardiovascular disease suggests that these levels of mercury exposure from moderate fish consumption probably do not represent reason for concern regarding cardiovascular risk even for the highest-risk, most susceptible individuals. We found no association after stratifying on baseline aspirin use (yes/no), suggesting that the potentially protective effect of aspirin on cardiovascular disease [45] also does not influence this relationship.  Many previous studies have investigated the relationship between mercury exposure and cardiovascular disease [11–18, 30]. The majority of findings are null, consistent with our own results. The few studies that observed positive associations had critical limitations [12, 13, 18, 19].

29,discussion3," Thus, selection and recall bias may have affected their results [12]. A prospective study found a positive association with incident coronary disease, but with no dose-response relationship, and no association with overall cardiovascular mortality [13]. Two cross-sectional studies found positive associations – one with cardiovascular disease [18], and another with arterial stiffness [19]. Yet cross-sectional designs cannot establish causality, and both of these studies measured blood rather than toenail mercury concentration. Blood samples are not as well time-integrated as nail samples; red blood cells typically have a 17-week turnover, compared to 26–52 weeks for toenails [46].",f34c99a1-02a6-4c9e-a576-d19f4fbbc5da
30,discussion4," However, these limitations do not entirely discount their credibility; policy and dietary recommendations regarding fish intake, mercury exposure and cardiovascular disease should be made in light of the entire body of evidence and should also take into account other non-cardiovascular harmful effects of mercury toxicity.  Our findings should not impact policies surrounding mercury pollution. The relationship between very high mercury exposure and increased risk of many health complications has been consistently demonstrated in other studies. The main application of our findings should be dietary recommendations for moderate to high fish consumption as part of ideal diets for cardiovascular disease prevention.  However, our findings do suggest that existing concerns for potential cardiovascular risk surrounding mercury exposure from fish consumption are probably unwarranted. Several aspects of our study population make these null results particularly meaningful.",3b2a6c0f-61cc-484b-af3c-b90f9a8bf8cd
31,discussion5," First, all participants are already at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, any increased risk from mercury would be very likely to cause cardiovascular disease events. Second, our participants consume very high levels of fish. Per capita seafood consumption in Spain is approximately twice the average for European countries [32]. The intervention group is encouraged to consume even more fish than what is typical in Spain. The mean fish intake in our study population is approximately 92.7 g/day, compared to approximately 31.6 g/day [11], 43 g/day [13], 30.4 g/day [14], and 39.3 g/day [19] in previous studies. The observed lack of increased cardiovascular risk in this population provides evidence that consuming even the highest levels of fish consumption do not increase mercury exposure to dangerous levels. The observed null findings in this population provide evidence that mercury exposure from relatively high fish consumption (e.g.",5e675a16-bd77-430a-8350-15debca4a6df
32,discussion6," 3 servings/week) is unlikely to increase risk of cardiovascular disease. Third, our population has much higher levels of mercury (0.66 μg/g) compared to three out of four of the populations that observed a positive association between mercury exposure and cardiovascular disease (0.26 μg/g [12], 0.45 μg/g [18], and 0.30 μg/g [19]). This suggests that higher mercury exposure is not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the context of a healthy Mediterranean diet with high fish intake.  These null results are likely generalizable to populations with lower cardiovascular disease risk and lower fish consumption, since any harmful effects of mercury exposure would have even less impact among these people. Toenail mercury concentration is an objective, stable and time-integrated biomarker. Our prospective study design and our exposure assessment using an objective biomarker prevents recall bias.",6bf8d76a-4034-4602-9384-be8866571cec
33,discussion7,"  In a recent report we showed the benefits of long-chain w-3 fatty acids from fish in the total data base of the trial.47 The hazard ratios for intake of corresponding to the levels of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids recommended by the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids were 0.84 (95% CI 0.67–1.05) for all-cause mortality, 0.61 (95% CI 0.39–0.96) for fatal cardiovascular disease, 0.54 (95% CI 0.29–0.99) for fatal coronary heart disease, and 0.49 (95% CI 0.22–1.01) for sudden cardiac death. In addition, there is extensive available evidence supporting the cardiovascular benefits of fish consumption discussed above. However, it should not be surprising that in the participants included in this sub-study we didn’t find associations between fish intake and cardiovascular disease. Virtually all established dietary guidelines recommend at least 1–2 servings of fish per week (1 serving = approximately 75 g) for cardiovascular benefits.",5eec052e-d6ae-4b78-acbd-8d47ee1e0564
34,discussion8," Furthermore, evidence suggests that higher levels of fish intake does not confer added benefits.1 Our study population consumes an average of 95 g of fish per day. It is likely that we have too small a sample size and an insufficient range of exposure (i.e. average fish consumption is too high) to observe the cardiovascular benefits of fish consumption within this case-control substudy of mercury exposure.  There are limitations to our study that warrant continued investigation of this issue. We only have one measure of toenail mercury concentration, but toenail mercury concentrations have high reproducibility over time and low within-person to between-person variation ratio. This suggests that our single measure is a strong indicator of long-term intake [26]. However, true associations may still be attenuated. For example, it is possible that measurement error contributed to our null results. We did not have biological measurements for n-3 fatty acids.",9796534a-e424-4d44-8377-e144c4f3b472
35,discussion9," Although the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) has been validated in this population, fish vary in their n-3 fatty acid content [47], and the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is still an imprecise measurement of n-3 fatty acids. Thus it is possible that imprecise measurement might have created residual negative confounding, as n-3 fatty acids would likely be positively associated with fish intake, and thus mercury levels, but inversely associated with cardiovascular disease. To address this, we conducted a bias analysis to assess the degree of plausible bias due to residual confounding by n-3 fatty acid intake (dichotomized at the median) based on our observed OR of 0.66 in Table 2, comparing the highest to lowest quartile of toenail mercury (Additional file 1: Table S7). We found that the odds ratio for the association between a dichotomous confounder (n-3 fatty acid) and cardiovascular disease would need to be as low as 0.",4eeccc3f-ea01-47c2-b4f2-2c0148037954
36,discussion10,"2, and difference in prevalence of the confounder (high n-3 fatty acid intake in the exposed (highest quartile of mercury intake) compared to unexposed (lowest quartile of mercury intake) must be very extreme (e.g. 0.2 in exposed, 0.8 in unexposed) to render the association as detrimental. Acknowledging that toenail mercury concentration is also a biomarker for fish intake, and fish intake is associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk, there could be negative residual confounding by fish intake or n-3 PUFA intake. This previously observed inverse association between fish intake and cardiovascular disease was not apparent in our data, probably because even in the lowest categories of fish consumption in our participants, the amount of fish consumed was already sufficiently high.",7434fc4a-5730-48f7-a115-56ba7d39fe95
37,discussion11," While we believe it is unlikely that fish intake may strongly confound our results, because we already adjusted for fish intake, we acknowledge that residual confounding may yet exist and that our bias analysis results are subject to different interpretations. Based on previous evidence, we believe that it is unlikely, that the cardiovascular benefits of n-3 PUFAs are strong enough to account for a residual confounding of such magnitude as to explain the lack of association observed between mercury levels and cardiovascular disease. High n-3 PUFA consumption would need to be associated with approximately 0.11 the odds of cardiovascular disease compared to low n-3 PUFA consumption assuming a high association (OR = 5) between mercury and n-3 intake (Additional file 1: Table S7).",a1305dde-6147-4a73-9f23-17d57d70fe77

The lowest RR of these 15 meta-analyses was 0.62 (0.46–0.82) [48]. Despite this, we still manipulated the prevalence of the confounder to be 0.11 and higher (0.23, 0.43, 0.62, 0.81). Even at a confounder-disease OR of 0.43, which is likely still too low given that the higher RRs from the extensive meta-analyses [48], the corrected RR would be 0.90. Under the 0.23 confounder-disease OR, almost certainly too extreme, it would be 1.13. While we believe that these results indicate that residual confounding from n-3 PUFA is probably insufficient to explain our results, we admit that this interpretation may be subjective and that under some of the scenarios shown in Additional file 1: Table S7, the association mercury-CVD could be detrimental.",ea4225ae-d9a2-4320-ba42-d1ebbeb2bd95
39,discussion13,"  To minimize participant burden, our food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) did not ask about consumption of specific types of fish. Thus, we could not obtain direct measurements of association between type of fish intake and toenail mercury concentrations. Seafood varies in mercury content [49], although mercury content of popular Spanish seafood have relatively consistent mercury levels [50]. Lastly, our sample size is small and many models are adjusted for many covariates, thus limiting our power, particularly when we adjust rather than match for sex and age in unconditional logistic regression models. However, it has been empirically demonstrated that the the rule of thumb usually suggested (adjusting for one confounder for every 10 events) can be relaxed [51].",8a80c285-f9e2-4b4a-903f-35713855de00
40,discussion14," However, the unique characteristics of our population described above, and the inverse association suggested by our point estimates, make it unlikely that we would have missed a material positive association between mercury exposure and cardiovascular disease. The role of other heavy metals in cardiovascular disease in this population merits further studies.  Conclusion Mercury exposure from fish intake did not appear to increase cardiovascular disease risk in our sample of high risk participants exposed to high levels of fish consumption and consequently mercury concentrations, though under some assumptions on residual confounding by n-3 fatty acids, a slightly increased risk could persist. We did not observe any substantial risk in this unique setting of elderly participants with high cardiovascular disease risk, high fish intake and relatively high toenail mercury concentrations.",59912e28-c419-4203-86ef-3eb078931870
41,discussion15," These findings have important public health implications, as they suggest that the mercury content in fish is not very likely to discount the well-known cardiovascular benefits of fish consumption. Based on our findings, dietary recommendations should continue to include high fish intake as part of a healthy diet. Our findings, coupled with previous extensive evidence, support the dietary recommendation of at least 1–2 servings of fish per week for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
