Other food groups included in MeD with strong correlations with pasta intake in both genders were onions and garlic, olive oil, seasoned cheese and rice (P for all<0.05).  Simple linear regression analysis indicated that pasta intake expressed as grams per day was positively associated with body mass index (BMI) in both genders (Figure 1).

26,discussion0,"Despite the evidence supporting the role of MeD adherence in the management of a favorable body weight,21, 22, 23 according to the best of our knowledge, there is no study evaluating this association for pasta as a MeD component. Our findings show a negative association of pasta consumption with general and central obesity in two methodologically and geographically different, large Mediterranean populations.  Pasta as a product of cereals has been since ancient times consumed in the Mediterranean area and it has been considered as one of MeD's traditional components, placed at the basis of the pyramid.1, 2 Our comparative analysis of data from two different Mediterranean populations supports that pasta intake is negatively associated with both indexes of obesity status and prevalence of overweight and obesity.",d320f539-9500-4df5-addd-6b0796025caf
27,discussion1,"  Our results are in agreement with a relatively recent study examining food and nutrient intakes in association with body mass index (BMI) in 1794 US middle-aged adults, showing that pasta intake among other food groups is negatively associated with body mass index (BMI).39 Moreover, evidence from Greek islands supports a favorable role of carbohydrate intake on central and general obesity.40  On the other hand, bias of over-estimation or under-estimation presented generally in dietary data was evident also in the present datasets especially in women. As a result, pasta intake expressed as grams per day, seemed to be positively associated with body mass index (BMI) in crude analysis. However, to overcome the related bias, the correction of food group consumption by total caloric intake using the 'energy residual methodology' was elaborated as a relatively frequent procedure in dietary analysis.41 The association changed direction and from positive became negative.",d56f5b30-a914-4257-9c90-a1068d47108a
28,discussion2,"  To strengthen our results, we also performed multiple approaches in dietary analysis. In fact, we used both 'energy residual methodology' and residual methodology for correcting pasta intake for body weight of the subjects.  This approach was derived from the observation that in both Moli-sani and Italian Nutrition & Health Survey (INHES) datasets, the association of pasta intake as grams per day with body mass index (BMI) from positive became negative after stratification for the body weight of the subjects. Standardized residuals were predicted in both datasets, using linear regression analysis with main outcome pasta intake (grams per day) and independent variable body weight (kg).  The generated pasta-body weight residuals were produced to be mathematically independent from body weight.",74251ace-3b89-4732-abad-bf13ddf9230a
29,discussion3," This was evident because the standardized residuals (that is, 'pasta-body weight residuals') that were predicted by using linear regression analysis with main outcome pasta intake (grams per day) and independent variable body weight (kg) are mathematically independent from body weight.  Again, pasta-body weight residuals were negatively associated with body mass index (BMI) in both populations and in both genders. Altogether, these different approaches strengthen the negative association of pasta intake with obesity indexes.  The measurement of body weight, as carried out in the Moli-sani study, is a simple physical examination that has limited systematic or random errors and might result in a reduction in overall error because the reported energy intake can be under miss- or over-reporting bias.",632616da-d55b-4a78-bf74-5aeef20f66ec
30,discussion4," The evidence that with both methodologies the negative association of pasta intake with obesity status was confirmed is possibly an indicator of the validity of the proposed methodology, although further investigation in prospective studies is needed.  During the last decades, a progressive increase in red meat consumption, fats, dairy products and simple sugars has been recorded in Italy.10, 42 The adherence to the MeD that may offer weight management advantages is significantly lowered.42 Pasta consumption has been modified, because it is frequently considered as a dietary factor that should be restricted in a weight loss program.  In this work, pasta intake was positively associated with the intake of other important food groups included in MeD such as tomatoes, tomato sauce, onions, garlic, olive oil, seasoned cheese and rice.",5ad6a469-0ee2-4821-ae90-51ac208b5397
31,discussion5,"5, 6, 21, 22, 23 However, it was interesting that the negative association of pasta intake with body mass index (BMI) was independent from MeD adherence and total daily caloric intake. Indeed, the negative association was not affected by either the addition of both MeD adherence index and total daily caloric intake into multivariate analysis or by the stratification for MeD adherence level.  From an epidemiological and clinical perspective, it could be important to evaluate the role of other food groups associated with pasta consumption on the management of body weight. The study of dietary patterns such as MeD or others not 'a-priori' defined in association with human anthropometry would be useful to understand the effect of the combination of pasta with other food group intake on the management of body weight.",013b4efa-4154-489e-8fc8-a9e764f89a66

Another novelty of the present work is the comparative assessment of the study hypothesis in both Moli-sani and Italian Nutrition & Health Survey (INHES) datasets.

Beyond the relevance of the findings of the present work, limitations do exist. First, because both Moli-sani and Italian Nutrition & Health Survey (INHES) are cross-sectional studies, they do not allow to provide cause–effect considerations in the observed associations. Prospective anthropometric data on these populations are still missing and limit the clinical significance of the present conclusions. In addition, bias of over- or under-estimation by the use of the dietary methodologies and for the extracted data (that is, pasta intake, adherence to MeD) should be acknowledged for both studies. The co-linearity presented in food group intake data (that is, pasta intake with other food groups) limits also the present analysis.",931b567d-8287-4a50-8b50-394a931c06f9
35,discussion9,"  In the Moli-sani study, although adequate from a broad epidemiological perspective, a food frequency questionnaire is less accurate at the individual level than other measurement methods. In addition, dietary information was retrieved only once and, thus, may be prone to recall bias and seasonal variation. Possible errors because of misreporting by the participating subjects should also be acknowledged. However, to rule out the possibility that the associations found were dependent on either changes in lifestyle (particularly in dietary habits) as a consequence of a disease or to the presence of less healthy food intake in healthy people, we had preliminarily excluded from our analyses all subjects with previous CVD or cancer and participants under special diets. Furthermore, the cross-sectional analysis design does not allow for concluding on the causality of the present associations.

36,discussion10," The one 24-h dietary recall could not be considered as representative of the dietary habits of an individual. The telephone-based interviews are under the limitation of misreporting or under/over-estimation of food consumption. The body weight and height was self-reported and under the related bias.  In conclusion, this study for the first time has observed a negative association of pasta consumption and central and overall obesity in a large sample of Mediterranean population. Pasta as the traditional component of MeD was studied for its association with obesity indexes. The comparative assessment of two different epidemiological datasets and the similarities revealed in the studied associations provide reliability and support to the present results.",7df7c135-396e-4881-af3d-52c8eb64cbec
