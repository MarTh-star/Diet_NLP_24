0,introduction0,"Aging is an irreversible process that is associated with a significant decline of the immune system that leads to increased susceptibility to infection, reduced efficiency of vaccination protocols and significantly higher incidence of autoimmune disorders and cancer (Castle, 2000; Dewan et al., 2012). Chronological age may also result in vascular aging with deterioration in arterial function (Jani and Rajkumar, 2006) associated with cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD)) that are the most common world-wide cause of morbidity and mortality in persons aged over 65 years, particularly those with diabetes mellitus. The negative impact on vascular function compromises the ability to resist oxidative stress and inflammation. Aging is characterized by a chronic, low grade inflammatory status termed “inflammaging” (Franceschi et al., 2000, 2007; Monti et al.",3e9cc38b-6316-48e3-bd41-429fdc03fb21
1,introduction1,", 2017), which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of major age-related chronic diseases and in important geriatric conditions (De Martinis et al., 2006; Pedersen, 2009; Lencel and Magne, 2011; Franceschi and Campisi, 2014) and in so doing contributes to both a poor quality of life and elderly mortality . Increased production of inflammatory mediators and the simultaneous down-regulation of anti-inflammatory ones takes place in a variety of tissues, organs and systems including adipose tissue, muscles, brain, and contribute to the onset and progression of such a systemic inflammatory state (Cevenini et al., 2010, 2013).  Immunosenescence is a hallmark of the aging organism and both the innate and adaptive arms of the mucosal and systemic immune systems are affected (Maijó et al., 2014; Man et al.",986a26b5-397e-40f4-9611-5609e5f10a5d
2,introduction2,", 2015), with alterations in constituent cells linked to the onset of chronic diseases and it is generally accepted that immunosenescence is accelerated in those subjects who present inflammaging. The design of interventional strategies to delay, halt or even possibly reverse immunosenescence requires a detailed understanding of the aging process at cellular level.  Although the individual genetic make-up that dictates immune responses cannot be modified, other factors contributing to aging such as lifestyle and diet  could be changed in the attempt to halt/reverse the progression of the detrimental effects of aging on immune effectiveness . To this end, the adoption of nutritional regimen to improve immune function in the elderly is a potentially important approach.",ab6597de-d791-4df7-bbf9-5799a6dd7880
3,introduction3," Indeed, a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, legumes, unrefined cereals and olive oil and accompanied by low intake of meat, dairy products and alcohol consumption typical of the Mediterranean is effective in decreasing the incidence of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases and increased longevity (Mena et al., 2009; Vasto et al., 2012; Casas et al., 2014, 2018; Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2015; Santangelo et al., 2018).  The recognition of nutrition as a possible determinant of successful aging was acknowledged by the European Union by funding a dietary intervention study, the NU-AGE project 1. A multidisciplinary European consortium developed a tailored dietary strategy to address the needs of the elderly (65–79 years) for promoting healthy aging in Europe.",46f58f99-748f-413d-97b3-f3a935cba235
4,introduction4," The dietary strategy included the daily supplementation of a low dose of vitamin D (10 μg or 400 IU/day) to minimize differences between study sites part of the whole NuAge project across different areas of Europe that differed in the diet and exposure to sunlight, two very critical factors for determining the vitamin D status. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of consuming a Mediterranean-like dietary pattern (NU-AGE diet) with vitamin D3 for 1 year on a large variety of parameters of immunity that included immune cell phenotype, co-receptor expression and innate immune responses.

8,methods3,"  Dietary Intervention The NU-AGE dietary intervention has been previously described . In brief, all participants (control and intervention groups) completed a 7-day food record diary within 2 weeks after the baseline assessment. This was followed by an interview with a specialized team member to review the records. The consumed food recorded in the food diary was coded according to standardized coding procedures . The control group, following a habitual diet, received only a leaflet with national dietary guidelines. The intervention group was given individually tailored Mediterranean diet advice plus a daily vitamin D3 supplement of 10 μg. The combination of the Mediterranean dietary pattern and vitamin D is henceforth referred to solely as MedDiet. The nutritional intervention was from the Food Based Dietary Guidelines for older adults (Berendsen et al.",aff8698f-bb9e-4a7f-99b7-8e4184c7bbb1

Participants were advised to consume on average 15–20% of their daily energy from protein, 50–60% from carbohydrate, 25–30% from fat (<10% from saturated fat, <1% from trans fatty acids, <12% from polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 8–28% from monounsaturated fatty acids). In addition, subjects were recommended to consume 30–40 g/day of fiber, <10–20 g/day of preferably red wine (1 serving/day for women and 2 for men), 2 g/day sodium, 1.3 g/day potassium, 10 mg/day iron, 15 μg/day of vitamin D3, 400 μg/day of folate, and 5 μg/day of vitamin B12.

Expression of Co-stimulatory Molecules on Freshly Isolated PBMC We then sought to investigate the effects of the MedDiet on the expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD28, KIRDL4 (CD158d), CD161 and TCR Vα24-Jα18 (NKT) on freshly isolated PBMCs. We observed that 1-year intervention had no effect on the expression of these immunoregulatory molecules between the different study groups (Table 6).",d8a9af85-7e4c-434d-9f46-1690f8a19af0
30,results11," Also, changes (Δ) of parameter values in MedDiet and control diet at baseline and after 1-year of intervention were determined (mean ± SD in inset) and compared (B).  Plasma Biomarkers Plasma was used to monitor the levels of the regulatory cytokines IL-9, IL-23, IL-2, IL-22 prior and after the 1-year dietary intervention. The cytokines IL-9 and IL-23 in plasma were above the lower limit of detection in only 4 of the 115 volunteers analyzed. IL-2 was present in more than 90% and IL-22 in more than 60% of the plasma samples analyzed. The statistical analysis of IL-2 and IL-22 did not show any significant MedDiet-associated change (Table 7).  Table 7 Effects of MedDiet on plasma levels of regulatory cytokines.

31,results12,"Discussion The MedDiet has been shown to down-regulate cellular and soluble inflammatory biomarkers related to the atherogenic process in subjects at high risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD)  and metabolic syndrome . However, the immunological outcomes have not been extensively studied. It is important to highlight that the MedDiet was supplemented with Vitamin D3 (10 μg/day, 400 IU). The reason for giving a low dose vitamin D supplement was to minimize differences between study sites part of the whole NuAge project, which covered North, South, East and West Europe in which habitual diet and sunlight exposure affect vitamin D status. This combined intervention design does not allow defining the relative influence of the MedDiet and/or vitamin D on innate immune parameters.",f3f805a6-8c90-4657-876d-9bc01b3e4689
32,results13," However, it has to be stressed that previous study showed that higher daily dose of vitamin D supplementation appeared to be effective on innate immunity and T cell reactivity . In our volunteers, adherence to a MedDiet diet for 1 year led to significant increase in the expression of CD40+CD86+ lymphocytes in women with a body mass index (BMI) < 31. The initiation of an adaptive immune response, requires multiple signals, including the expression of costimulatory molecules. CD40 is expressed in B cells and Allophycocyanin (APC)s and contribute to activate T cells through the CD40 ligand, in the absence of CD40 many cellular and immune functions are defective . CD86 is also necessary for T cell activation and survival, is the ligand for CD28 and CTLA-4 and works in tandem with CD80.",79c269da-655b-4cbd-bb57-48792969c5d2
33,results14," As these costimulatory molecules are important in immune activation, an association with gender may be related to the fact that women exhibit stronger cellular- and humoral-mediated immune responses compared to men, with a higher risk of autoimmune disease.  Within the MedDiet group we observed that the ratio of IL-12p40/IL-12p70 tended to decline. IL-12 up-regulates the expression of its own receptor, and elderly individuals have increased production of IL-12. The biological activity of the IL-12 is driven by the heterodimeric molecule IL-12p70, while IL-12p40 may antagonize IL-12. Indeed, total IL-12, IL-12p40, and the ratio IL-12p40/IL-12p70 increase significantly in aging . So, a decrease of the ratio IL-12p40/IL-12p70 may improve IL-12 functionality in elderly people. If this was the case, it is plausible that increased functionality of IL-12 might contribute to inflammageing.",3e90df89-ba8c-477b-9dcf-215221849982
34,results15," Also, a trend of decreased secretion of IL-12Rβ1 in the intervention group was observed. IL-12Rβ1 is a type 1 transmembrane receptor physically associated with the p40-domain common to both IL-12/IL23 and promotes their respective signaling pathways (Robinson, 2015). Regarding the trend in higher IFN-β but lower SOCS3 production in the MedDiet intervention group, IL-12 and IFN- β both signal through STAT4 phosphorylation, and a defective type I IFN response is described in T cells from elderly people . Higher production of type I IFN may improve the immune response of elderly people against infection. Upregulation of TGF-β would therefore result in suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-12 and, also SOCS3 that down-regulates the STAT4-mediated IL-12 signaling by binding to the STAT4 docking site in IL-12Rβ2 . SOCS3 proteins are constitutively expressed in naïve T helper cells and tends to decrease after cell stimulation.",e58f858d-8b0a-41ba-b1c7-2236d511e2ff
35,results16," In aging, expression of SOCS3 is higher than in young people and does not decrease after stimulation . Our results showing a trend toward lower expression of SOCS3 after Toll Like Receptor (TLR) stimulation would suggest the potential of MedDiet to exert beneficial effects.  DCs in human peripheral blood are divided in two subsets. Myeloid (m)DC are characterized by the production of high levels of IL-12 when stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α or CD40 ligand and trigger a Th1-polarized immune response. Plasmacytoid (p)DCs drive an IL-4-independent Th2 polarization of naive T cells and secrete high levels of type I IFN, and IL-12 in response to certain bacteria (Stout-Delgado et al., 2008). In the elderly people, a decrease in pDCs but not mDCs (Shodell and Siegal, 2002; Pérez-Cabezas et al., 2007; Jing et al., 2009) was reported although others have reported conflicting results (Della Bella et al., 2007).",c1494c64-8a3c-4f32-a957-b8f998152932
36,results17," However, it appeared that in frail individuals both populations are affected . Our data did not show any significant change in the mDCs and pDC populations in the control group compared to the intervention group, but it would appear that the mDC/pDC ratio tend to decrease. This finding suggests a TH2 predisposition of immune responses in the MedDiet group related to a polarized mDC:pDC balance toward pDCs, but a prolonged intervention study would be needed to confirm and possibly extend this observation.  The number, phenotype, and functions of NK cells are affected by the aging process in humans  and NKT cell numbers are increased . T cells from aging individuals showed increased expression of KIR whose expression is mostly found on senescent memory T cells that have lost CD28 expression .",183e0f64-d3c6-45e8-b691-a9dd65762cde
37,results18," Cells that produce IL-17 express CD161, and in the elderly, there is a decrease in expression of CD161+CD4 T cells . Our study shows no change in the expression of these markers following MedDiet intervention.  The majority of studies on aging to date have involved at-risk populations such as, for example individuals with pre-existing hypertension or metabolic syndrome. Instead our study focused on healthy elderly that did not have any signs of chronic disease or significantly impaired immune function; it is likely that this approach might have made more difficult to observe striking beneficial effects of the MedDiet.  Conclusion After 1 year of adherence to a Mediterranean-like dietary pattern with vitamin D3 supplements the only significant changes observed were in female participants with a body mass index (BMI) < 31.",3dbd59f4-75ad-4d25-9a90-79164d713e1a
38,results19," However, it is important to stress there was a tendency toward improvement of certain importance in some of the inflammaging-related parameters measured, such as a greater T cell response after Toll Like Receptor (TLR)s stimulation. For the other parameters studied, it is likely that in the absence of overt risk factors or overly compromised immune function overt benefits cannot be detected after a relatively short-term adoption of the MedDiet.
