0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design In the current analysis, we used data from the Mamma & Bambino project, an ongoing mother-child cohort settled in Catania, Italy, which aims to understand the effects of social, environmental, behavioral, and molecular factors on maternal and infant health. Study design and protocols have been fully described elsewhere [47,48] and at the website http://www.birthcohorts.net. From 2015, this cohort prospectively recruits pregnant women during their prenatal genetic counselling (median gestational age = 16 weeks; range = 4–20 weeks) at the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria “Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele” (Catania, Italy). Pregnancy is the unit of observation with planned follow-up of children at birth, one and two years. Women with plurality, pre-existing medical conditions or pregnancy complications (i.e.",632606db-ff68-45b6-bb22-1a411a59822a
1,methods1,", autoimmune and/or chronic diseases, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and diabetes), intrauterine fetal death, and congenital malformations were excluded from this study. The study protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of the involved Institution (CE Catania 2; Prot. N. 227/BE and 275/BE). Participants were informed and gave written their informed consent of the purpose and procedures of the study, which was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.  2.2. Data Collection At the recruitment, socio-demographic and behavioral information was collected by trained epidemiologist through structured questionnaires. Educational level was classified as low (primary school), medium (high school), or high (degree or higher), while employment status was categorized as unemployment (including students and housewives) and employment (both part-time and full-time). Women were also classified in those who lived alone or in couple, and in those who had children or not.",a3d5c805-249f-45dd-929b-a0528940cb08
2,methods2," With respect to smoking status, women were classified as non-smokers, former smokers, or current smokers. Women were asked to report their weight and height before pregnancy and pregestational BMI was calculated as weight in kg divided by height in m2 and classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria [49]. Women were also asked to report if they followed dietary restrictions or suffered from food intolerances.  2.3. Assessment of Dietary Folate Intake and Adherence to Mediterranean Diet Dietary folate intake was evaluated using a 95-item semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) referred to 30 days before recruitment [12,13,50,51,52] and hence to the early phase of pregnancy (i.e., from the beginning to the 16 week of gestation).",7b3c54f7-0a08-4ad8-929c-e7045c9d079b
3,methods3," The extended form of this tool was adapted from a 46-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), which has been validated for the assessment of folate intake in Italian women of child-bearing age [13]. For each food item, information on frequency of consumption (twelve categories from “almost never” to “two or more times a day”) and portion size (small, medium, and large) were collected using an indicative photograph atlas, and then converted into daily food intakes. Dietary folate intake was calculated using the table of food composition of the US Department of Agriculture (http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/), adapted to typical Italian food consumption. Inadequate folate intake was defined as an intake < 600 μg/day of dietary folate equivalents (DFEs) [53]. Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) was evaluated using the 9-item Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)), as previously described [54,55].",6119cb0b-ebda-4eb1-a0ef-041363a20d7f
4,methods4," For this reason, ranged from 0 (non-adherence) to 9 (perfect adherence) and adherence to MD was classified as low (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) ≤ 3), medium (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) = 4–6), or high (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) > 6) [56].  2.4. Use of Folic Acid Supplements Women were also asked to report the use of folic acid supplements, alone or in combination with other multivitamin supplements, before pregnancy and during the first trimester of pregnancy. The current Italian recommendation suggests that women who plan to become pregnant should use folic acid supplements for 4 weeks before and until 12 weeks after conception [57]. Accordingly, women were classified as non-users (i.e., women who did not use folic acid supplements), insufficient users (i.e., women who did not take folic acid supplements as recommended), and recommended users.  2.5.",6e64d5ff-0715-44be-bc8e-047c76d5af03
5,methods5," Neonatal Outcomes Gestational age and neonatal anthropometric measures were assessed at birth, among women with who completed singleton pregnancy. At recruitment, gestational age was assessed by ultrasound evaluation and used to define preterm birth as spontaneous delivery before 37 weeks. According to sex-specific national reference charts, birth weight and length were used to assess birthweight for gestational as follows: small for gestational age (birth weight < 10th percentile for gestational age), adequate for gestational age, or large for gestational age (birth weight > 90th percentile for gestational age) [58].  2.6. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 26.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Characteristics of pregnant women according to dietary folate intake and folic acid supplement use were described using frequency (%) or median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)).",d87b5527-7d1c-494c-8720-12a005efe658
6,methods6," Categorical variables were compared using Chi-squared test. Continuous variables were checked for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify main determinants of inadequate folate intake and folic acid supplement use. The models included variables that were significantly associated with inadequate folate intake or folic acid supplement use in the univariate analysis. Results were reported as Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical tests were two-sided, and p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  3. Results 3.1. Dietary Folate Intake Among Pregnant Women The current study included 397 pregnant women from the “Mamma & Bambino” cohort (aged 15–50 years old, median = 37 years old) recruited from 2015 to 2019, 282 out of which completed pregnancy at the time of this study. In general, the average dietary folate intake was 533.4 μg/day (median = 516.",dc322c77-3b2e-4918-b918-1e3c53430e81
7,methods7,"3 μg/day; range = 68.9–2633.5 μg/day), and 64.7% of women (n = 257) did not meet the current recommendation of 600 μg/day during pregnancy. Figure 1 displays the distribution of women according to dietary folate intake and the use of supplements. Table 1 shows the characteristics of women according to their dietary folate intake. We observed that women who did not meet dietary recommendation were more likely to be smokers (p = 0.028) and exhibited higher pregestational BMI (p = 0.029) than their counterpart. With respect to dietary habits, women who did not meet dietary recommendation were more likely to follow dietary restrictions (p = 0.003) and less likely to adhere to MD (p < 0.001). Interestingly, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that following dietary restrictions (OR = 2.180; 95%CI = 1.085–4.378; p = 0.029), being a smoker (OR = 1.457; 95%CI = 1.046–2.030; p = 0.026), and low adherence to MD (OR = 3.194; 95%CI = 1.958–5.210; p < 0.",163383bd-aca6-4648-8d66-c25963380efe
8,methods8,"001) were the main determinants of inadequate folate intake. In the subsample of 282 women who completed pregnancy, we also noted a higher percentage of small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) among those with inadequate folate intake (p < 0.001).  3.2. Use of Folic Acid Supplements We next examined the use of folic acid supplements among women of the Mamma & Bambino cohort. Figure 2A shows that only 2.8% of women did not take supplements, 74.8% were classified as insufficient users before pregnancy, while 22.4% met the recommendation before and during pregnancy. We also compared supplement use between women with inadequate folate intake and those with adequate folate intake (Figure 2B). Compared with the latter, we observed higher proportions of non-users and recommended users among women with inadequate folate intake. By contrast, a higher proportion of insufficient users has been observed among women with adequate dietary folate intake.",9f410ae6-9b03-49b5-818d-d9eb23e691a1
9,methods9," However, these differences were not statistically significant. With respect to neonatal outcomes, we did not observe differences in the proportion of preterm birth and inadequate birthweight for gestational age (p = 0.430 and p = 0.770, respectively).  3.3. Determinants of Folic Acid Supplement USE Among Women with Inadequate Folate Intake We next aimed to identify the main determinants of folic acid supplement use among 257 women who did not meet the recommendation of dietary folate intake. Univariate analysis showed that women who did not take supplements were less educated (p < 0001) and reported lower Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (p = 0.047) than supplement users (Table 2). Notably, logistic regression analysis further confirmed that women with low educational level were more likely to not take folic acid supplements than their more educated counterpart (OR = 5.574; 95%CI = 1.487–21.435; p = 0.012).  3.4.",a240b09d-5c3c-4630-962c-645c6a9c9ed2
10,methods10," Use of Supplements and Neonatal Outcomes Finally, we examined the effect of folic acid supplement use on neonatal outcomes among women with inadequate folate intake. With this in mind, we investigated 184 women with inadequate folate intake, who completed singleton pregnancy. In this subsample, median gestational duration was 39 weeks, with 9.8% of preterm deliveries. With respect to neonatal anthropometric measures, median values of birth weight and length were 3.25 Kg (range = 1.0–4.75 Kg) and 50.0 cm (range = 41–56 cm), respectively. According to sex-specific national reference charts [51], approximately 84.1% of newborns were adequate for gestational age (adequate for gestational age (AGA)), while 5.5% and 10.4% have been classified as small for gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA), respectively.",150cd8bb-b571-41a6-a583-5eb3886e670d
11,methods11," Compared with women who met supplement recommendation, we observed a higher proportion of small for gestational age (SGA) newborns among those who did not take supplements before pregnancy and those who did not take any at all (p = 0.009) (Figure 3A). By contrast, the proportion of adequate for gestational age (AGA) newborns was the highest among women who took supplements before and during pregnancy. Instead, no difference in the distribution of large for gestational age (LGA) newborns was evident. We also noted that the proportion of preterm newborns was higher among non-users and insufficient users of folic acid supplements (Figure 3B). However, these differences were not statistically significant.  4. Discussion The recommended intake of folate for pregnant women is 600 μg/day DFE, an estimation that was introduced to account for difference in the bioavailability between synthetic folic acid and naturally occurring folate [53].",05f477f5-6bde-44f3-8233-f7ad4d691197
12,methods12," Magnitude of folate deficiency varies between and within countries, with higher prevalence in those without folic acid fortification of cereal-grain products [59,60]. In our study, two out of three women did not meet current recommendation. The high prevalence of deficient women was in line with figures obtained by previous studies from the same Italian region [12,13,50,61,62].  The primary aim of our study was to uncover the main determinants of dietary folate intake, an approach that could help the development of public health strategies against folate deficiency in states of increased demand (e.g., pregnancy and lactation). With this in mind, we observed that women who followed dietary restrictions and those with low adherence to MD were more likely to report inadequate folate intake.",6b3a0426-2410-41e2-8d94-557a8895361a
13,methods13," In fact, naturally-occurring folates are present in high concentrations in green leafy vegetables, dark green vegetables, legumes, and some fruits [63], so that higher intakes can be expected among people who follow a varied and balanced diet such as the MD. Moreover, we noted that inadequate folate intake was higher among current smokers than in former or non-smoking women. This is in line with previous findings reporting unhealthy diet among smokers [64,65,66], with greater intake of saturated fat and cholesterol, and lower intake of vitamins and fiber [67].  Beyond folate intake, supplementation of folic acid during the periconceptional period represents one of the best strategies to tackle pregnancy adverse outcomes, as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2006 [17]. However, the prevalence of folic acid supplementation remains often inadequate in several countries [20,68].",f8843649-819c-4070-95c2-5b7d49e0fb58
14,methods14," Although we showed that only ~3% of pregnant women did not take folic acid supplements, ~75% of them did not take supplements as recommended (i.e., 4 weeks before conception until 8 weeks after). Our data were consistent with a previous study reporting that only 3% of Italian pregnant women used folic acid supplements as recommended [69]. By contrast, in other European countries, prevalence of recommended users reached 50% [70]. In our study, the proportions of insufficient or non-users were not significantly different according to dietary folate status. However, among women with inadequate folate intake, those with low educational level were more likely to not use folic acid supplements than their more educated counterpart. Several studies aimed to identify the main determinants of inadequate supplement use during pregnancy.",13bfc1c6-55bf-413d-a764-246e358e7013
15,methods15," Among social factors, for instance, it has been demonstrated that younger age [20], low income [71], educational level [68], and employment status [21] might affect the use of folic acid supplements. In our opinion, social inequalities in the use of supplements could be partially explained by the reduced level of knowledge, attitude, and awareness among the more disadvantaged groups [22]. Our findings, together with those from previous studies, underline the need for increasing the prevalence of folic acid supplementation through the identification of people at the highest risk for folate deficiency.  It has been clearly demonstrated that low maternal folate intake during the periconceptional period increases the risk for neural tube defect (e.g., spina bifida, anencephaly) and perhaps for other congenital anomalies (e.g., congenital heart defects, oral cleft lip and plate) and adverse outcomes [17].",9ff91f17-0fae-4fd0-98a0-1547f60f2224
16,methods16," In our study, for instance, we reported higher proportions of small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) births among women with inadequate folate intake compared with those who met dietary recommendation. However, these data did not take into account the use of folic acid supplements. For this reason, we also evaluated the effects of folic acid supplements among women with inadequate folate intake. In this subgroup, we consistently reported a higher proportion of small for gestational age (SGA) births among women who did not take supplement before pregnancy and those who did not take at all. It is worth mentioning that small for gestational age (SGA) is one of the main risk factors for adverse outcomes and mortality at birth [72,73], as well as for chronic diseases in later life [74,75,76,77,78].",bbee0b94-d1cd-42a2-b26e-7047750f3e4a
17,methods17," In line, the implementation of policies based on folic acid supplementation should be one of the main goals to tackle the burden of low birthweight, especially in developing countries. However, there are still controversies about the effect of folic acid supplementation on low birth weight and small for gestational age (SGA) risks. The majority of studies demonstrated that supplement use before and during pregnancy reduced the risk of small for gestational age (SGA) [31,36,38,40,42,44,79]. However, others demonstrated an opposite [39,41] or null effect [30,45]. Thus, further research should be encouraged to understand the effect of folic acid supplement use on the risk of small for gestational age (SGA) and associated outcomes.  Our findings should be interpreted with cautions due to some limitations. Firstly, the Mamma & Bambino study is an ongoing mother-child cohort that recruits pregnant women during their prenatal genetic counselling.",a1fc6ff3-eb03-4c11-ba77-fbdeaa9a8fe4
18,methods18," For this reason, there is a discrepancy in the number of pregnant women with those who completed pregnancy. We described prevalence and determinants of dietary folate intake and supplement use among 397 pregnant women. Instead, findings on the neonatal effects of folate deficiency were obtained in a subsample of women who completed pregnancy, and thus should be confirmed by future analysis. In general, low sample size in some subgroups (e.g., women with inadequate folate intake and those who completed pregnancy) did not allow us to adjust for potential confounders. Moreover, we cannot rule out the possibility of bias from residual unknown or unmeasured factors. For instance, it has been demonstrated that several genetic polymorphisms involved in folate metabolism affected folate status in healthy subjects before and after folic acid supplement use [80,81].",772577bc-0c50-4dd0-a1f5-70c45bd0188e
19,methods19," Secondly, data on dietary folate intake and folic acid supplement use relied on self-reported interviews, which cannot completely exclude reporting errors. For instance, we previously reported that folate intake was higher when assessed with the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) than with a 4 days weighed dietary record [13]. To overcome this limitation, in the future, studies should evaluate folate status by measuring folate blood concentration and reviewing the size and morphology of blood cells.  In spite of these limitations, our study underlined the need for improving the adherence of pregnant women with recommendations for dietary folate intake and supplement use. On one hand, this could be achieved with the promotion of a healthy diet rich in vegetables and fruits.",d4196ff9-5160-403a-b03e-79503d49213a
20,methods20," On the other hand, the identification of social determinants that might affect the use of folic acid supplements could help the development of public health strategies and policies to reduce the burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Although we demonstrated a protective effect of folic acid supplement use on risk of small for gestational age (SGA), further research is encouraged to corroborate our findings.
