1,methods1," Sample Collection VOO samples of the Picholine marocaine cultivar were purchased in a local market and belong to four different regions of Northern Morocco: Fes-Meknes (Taounate and Taza), Drâa-Tafilalet (Errachidia), Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima (Chefchaouen) and Beni Mellal-Khenifra (Beni Mellal) [41]. According to the label reported, olives were harvested between October and December 2018.  3.3. Determination of Acidity Five grams of VOO was dissolved in a mixture of diethyl ether and ethanol solvents (50:50, v/v). Then, 50 mL of titrated sodium hydroxide 0.1 M was used, with the addition of phenolphthalein as an indicator [26]. Acidity is expressed as follows:  Acidity (%) = 100 (M × V × M’/m)  where: M: molarity of sodium hydroxide solution (0.1 M); V: volume of titrated sodium hydroxide solution (mL), m: the weight of olive oil (g); M’: the molar weight of oleic acid (282 g/mol).  3.4.",4afebb31-32a3-4391-a17a-11812d7d4b05
2,methods2," Phenolic Compounds Extraction The extraction of phenolic compounds from VOO was determined following a protocol described previously [36,41,42]. Briefly, 1 g of VOO was dissolved in 1 mL of n-hexane, and then hexane phase was discarded. Then, 1 mL of a mixture of methanol:water (60:40, v/v) was added, vortexed, sonicated with ultrasound bath (rt, 37; Hz, 60 W) and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 relative centrifugal force. The procedure was repeated three times. The extract was then dissolved in 500 µL of a mixture of methanol:water (60:40, v/v) and filtered through a 0.45 µm pore size membrane filter. Before injection to HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS, 20 µL (1000 ppm) of ethyl gallate, as an internal standard, was added to each extract.  3.5.

The separation of phenolic compounds was carried out on an Ascentis Express C18 (150 × 4.6 mm, 2.7 µm) analytical column (Merck Life Science, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Mobile phases were as follows: A (H2O/0.1% HCOOH) and B (acetonitrile/0.1% HCOOH); the flow rate was 1 mL/min. The elution gradient was: 0.1 min 10% B, 4 min 35% B, 12 min 47% B, 12.5 min% B, min 60% B,16 min 75% B, 21 min 100% B and the injection volume was 10 µL.

4,methods4,"  The chromatographic method was validated by determining the linearity, repeatability and recovery of the extraction at two fortification levels; limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (limit of quantification (LOQ)s) were estimated on the basis of 3:1 and 10:1 (signal-to-noise ratio). The calibration curves of the gallic acid, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, caffeic acid, oleuropein, luteolin and apigenin were constructed by injecting 5 μL of standard solution five times at four different concentrations (1 mg L−1, 25 mg L−1, 50 mg L−1 and 100 mg L−1) into the HPLC configuration. Derivates and isomers of oleuropein, elenolic acid and oleacein were quantified with the calibration curve obtained, using oleuropein as a standard. Verbascoside isomers and acetoxypinoresinol were quantified with the calibration curve of hydroxytyrosol. Tyrosol glucoside and ligstroside aglycone were quantified with the calibration curve of tyrosol.  3.6.",b6b1e253-4b63-4f6c-bb45-4a2b70c6287e

Then, the solution was mixed for 2 min at 2000 rpm and heated for 15 min at 95 °C. Subsequently, 50 µL of boron trifluoride diluted in methanol (14% w/v) was added to the reaction mixture and the solution was mixed for 2 min at 2000 rpm and heated for 15 min at 95 °C.

7,methods7,"20 µm film thickness) (Merck Life Science, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The column oven temperature program ranged from 50 to 280 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The injection temperature was set at 280 °C/min, with an injection volume of 0.2 µL, using a split ratio of 1:50. Then, helium was used as a carrier gas with a linear velocity of 30 °C/cm and an inlet pressure of 26.6 kPa. For mass spectra analysis, a mass range of 40–550 m/z, electron ionization of 70 eV, an ion source temperature of 250 °C, an interface temperature of 200 °C and a detector voltage of 0.98 kV were used. FAMEs were identified by linear retention indices (LRIs) calculation, using C4–C24 standard solution. MS similarity spectra (over 90%) and LRI compared to the database values of lipids (LIPIDS Mass Spectral Library, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) were used for peak assignments.",0114a39c-b7f8-45fc-a845-e0a07f4e9f89
8,methods8,"  GC-FID analyses were carried out using a GC-2010 (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) instrument equipped with a split/splitless injector, AOC-20i autosampler and FID detector. The column and temperature program was the same as that described for the GC–MS analysis. The FID parameters were as follows: FID temperature at 280 °C, hydrogen flow at 40 mL/min, make-up flow (nitrogen) at 30mL/min and air flow at 400 mL/min. All experiments were performed in triplicate.  3.9. Statistical Analysis The results were expressed as mean values ± standard deviation (SD). All data were subjected to principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) and were included in a heat map. Olive oil origins (provinces) were considered as the variables in these plots and the different biological compounds (phenolic compounds, vitamin E, and fatty acids), except for the acidity, as treatments.",26f5c2c5-5f62-4fcc-abda-d5962c45c183
9,methods9," principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to examine the relationship between the studied provinces and different biological compounds.  4. Conclusions In this study, phenolic compounds, vitamin E and fatty acids of Picholine marocaine VOO from different provinces of Morocco were characterized by HPLC-PDA/ESI-MS, NP-HPLC/fluorescence detector (FLD) and GC–MS/FID, respectively. Picholine marocaine VOOs of the studied provinces showed a variable amount of phenolic compounds such as tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein aglycone, as well as vitamin E. According to the International Regulations in force, the phenol content of three of them, namely Taounate, Chefchaouen and Beni Mellal, reached the established limits [27]; only one, viz. Taounate, complied with Regulation 432/2012 of the European Union in terms of vitamin E [28], whereas all of them satisfied the limits contained in Consiglio Oleicolo Internazionale (COI) 2001 for fatty acid content [29].",c84f8daa-9705-4f08-8cdc-ee4de4278148
10,methods10," This suggests that the Moroccan VOO production needs to be improved in order to provide consumers with higher quality products in favor of their health.  The heat map and the principal component analysis allowed us to classify the provinces studied in terms of VOO chemical composition, representing a valuable method for the characterization of samples of different regions. These preliminary results could be a starting point for a further investigation to be applied to a more consistent number of commercial VOO (and EVOO) samples from Picholine marocaine.
