0,methods0," A longitudinal study was conducted in 296 patients from primary care. All patients had obesity or overweight and were diagnosed with MetS according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) ATP III definition [36], meeting at least three of cardiovascular risk (CVR) criteria (high BP, impaired fasting plasm glucose (FPG), HDL-C and TG levels or increased WC). In order to ensure menopause status, men and women were aged older than 55 and 60 years, respectively, to make cardiovascular risk (CVR) comparable between sexes [37,38]. Outpatients were consecutively recruited from December 2014 to December 2016 in Granada (Spain) and followed up for one year. All of them were Caucasian and did not present active cancer or previous history of cancer, morbid obesity (≥40 kg/m²), any prevalent cardiovascular disease or bone diseases and/or any health problem that could interfere with the study protocol.",21f3c1d0-75bb-4ded-8ea3-69d1fb00d33f
1,methods1," The study was approved by the ethics committee of Granada in accordance with the principles of the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki. All patients signed the informed consent before being included. Anthropometric data were determined by standard procedures and sociodemographic variables were collected by questionnaire. Patients reported smoking status, pharmacological treatment and T2D prevalence. Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) were obtained using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer reporting the mean BP by the equation (2 ∗ DBP + SBP)/3) [39]. Diet quality and physical activity were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of follow-up by the 14 items MedDiet adherence [40] and the Nurses’ Health Study for Spanish population [41] questionnaires, respectively.",e83ca881-72f8-4502-945a-ab15d6d9a273
2,methods2," Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast and conventional analyses of lipid profile (total, HDL and LDL-Cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) level), fasting plasm glucose (fasting plasm glucose (FPG)) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were performed. Serum ucOC levels were measured in duplicate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) according to Takara Bio, Japan instructions at baseline, 6 and 12 months of follow up. Intra- and inter-assay variations precision testing were consistent with reported by the manufacturer (6%–10% and 5.21%–8.33%, respectively).",835f32e7-eeb8-4399-8918-9b1ab38dceee
3,methods3,"  Although all MetS patients were treated as usual from primary care professionals, they were recommended to follow a healthy MedDiet to increase the consumption of olive oil, fruits, vegetables and nuts and decrease the consumption of meat, simple sugars and saturated fats and encouraged to practice physical activity according to the WHO recommendations (at least 150–300 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity; or at least 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity; or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity throughout the week) [42].  In order to classify cardiovascular risk (CVR) in MetS patients, a Z-score (CV-ZS) was calculated at baseline and during follow-up using the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) ATP III cardiovascular risk (CVR) criteria [36]. The mean-centering and standard deviation (SD) normalization were sex-specific for each variable by the (x-mean (x))/SD equation.",18f64804-ad95-4ea5-87f3-47a7dbf7cfef
4,methods4," Global cardiovascular risk (CVR) punctuation was the average of the Z-scores of mean BP, TG levels, WC, fasting plasm glucose (FPG) and the inverse Z-score of HDL-C [43]. The cardiovascular risk (CVR) Framingham score was estimated by the Wilson P.W. et al. equation including age, T2D prevalence, smoking and sex-adjusted cardiovascular risk (CVR) variables (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, systolic and diastolic BP) [44]. The cut-off point corresponding to the 25th percentile of baseline log ucOC levels was used to evaluate the cardiometabolic profile and cardiovascular risk (CVR) of MetS patients at baseline and at 6 and 12 months follow-up.  Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The normality of the variables was checked by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and a log transformation was performed for serum ucOC levels.",28434a9b-d75e-4e3f-9735-e194c5982375
5,methods5," Continuous variables with normal distribution were presented as mean ± SD, and categorical variables were expressed as percentages. Student’s t and ANOVA tests for continuous variables and χ2 test for categorical variables were used to determine statistical differences among the means of two or more groups. ANCOVA model was performed when an adjustment by covariates was required. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to analyze the associations between continuous variables. The variables influencing cardiovascular risk (CVR) such as age, sex, smoking, sedentary activities and pharmacologic treatment for MetS (lipid-lowering, antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs) were identified by multiple linear regression analysis. Multiple logistic regression model was applied to analyze ucOC as an estimator of T2D. A ROC curve was performed to estimate the usefulness of circulating ucOC levels as a marker of T2D risk.",91f74c04-7f22-4551-a954-161aebe20b79
6,methods6," Values of the area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) higher than 0.75 indicate a good predictive performance [45]. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.10 for multiple linear regression analysis and at p < 0.05 (two tailed) for the other analyses.  3. Results  Baseline characteristics of the study population according to sex are shown in Table 1. The proportion of women and men was 21.7% and 20.0%, respectively, of patients that had been previously diagnosed with T2D considering the American Diabetes Association criteria [46], with no differences by sex. More than 90% of the patients were hypertensive, 72.6% were obese and 94% of the females and 87.4% of the males showed high risk waist circumference (WC). The prevalence of dyslipidemia was similar for both sexes, however men showed significantly lower baseline HDL-C levels and women showed significantly higher LDL-C levels. Regarding lifestyle habits, mean MedDiet index was 8.",e5765bfc-eca6-4f9a-b507-ca6e260cd3e0
7,methods7,"6, without significant differences by gender, and men showed a higher prevalence of smoking and sedentary habits. In addition, males showed significantly lower ucOC serum levels and higher cardiovascular risk (CVR) measured by CV-ZS and Framingham score.  Table 2 shows the evolution of MetS risk factors (anthropometric measures, lipid and glycemic profile), MedDiet index, serum ucOC levels and cardiovascular risk (CVR) scores at the 6 and 12 month follow-up. The general population showed a general improvement especially at the 6 month follow-up. BMI, WC, HDL-C and BP decreased significantly, which slightly reduced total cardiovascular risk (CVR) measured by CV-ZS and Framingham scores. Mean MedDiet index increased above the recommended (nine points) and lipid and glycemic profiles showed an improvement, but only serum TG showed significative differences during the follow-up period.",19d628c9-96b9-48fe-a5cb-0b2f664536ab
8,methods8," Serum HDL-C and ucOC levels increased significantly at the 6-month point but decreased again at the 12-month point, showing a significant correlation during the follow-up (Figure 1).  Table 3 shows the variables correlated with serum ucOC levels. Apart from HDL-C levels, ucOC showed a significant negative correlation with HbA1c levels and cardiovascular risk (CVR) at baseline measured according to CV-ZS and Framingham, as well as with sex.  Serum ucOC levels increased from baseline 6.06 ng/mL to 9.44 ng/mL at 6 months and decreased to 6.39 ng/mL at the 12-months follow-up. We compared ucOC levels between patients with and without prevalentT2D at baseline, at the 6 and 12 month follow-up. Since ucOC levels were correlated with sex, we adjusted for sex and age (Table 4).",4f420c4a-1a8f-4caa-b53a-6ef0d156f89a
9,methods9,"  The independent association of ucOC serum levels (log) and CV-ZS was estimated through multiple linear regression model adjusting for age, sex, smoking, sedentary status, prevalent T2D and any MetS pharmacological treatment previously described. Baseline serum levels of ucOC appeared as an independent variable associated with CV-ZS for non-T2DM patients (Table 5). However, this association was not statistically significant at the 6- and 12-month follow-up analysis.  In order to analyze the influence of serum ucOC levels on cardiovascular risk (CVR) factors, they were compared according to the 25th percentile of the logarithm of baseline ucOC serum levels (0.92 ng/mL) previously reported [43] by ANCOVA analysis, adjusting for sex (Table 6). This cut-off point was applied at the 6- and 12-month follow-up. A cardiometabolic profile were significantly disturbed when ucOC levels were below 0.",3db79441-2404-4ce9-b830-7dad5f27e0d3
10,methods10,"92 ng/mL, and thus cardiovascular risk (CVR) estimated by CV-ZS was higher for these patients during the follow up period.  Finally, the relationship between serum ucOC levels and T2D prevalence was analyzed by performing logistic regression including biological variables classically linked to T2D (age, sex, sedentary status, lipid profile and WC) in addition to ucOC serum levels as independent variables, showing a negative association (OR = 0.051; [0.011/0.226], p < 0.001).  An ROC curve was performed to analyze circulating ucOC ability to identify T2D prevalence. The model including ucOC serum levels best described T2D prevalence, since it showed the highest area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.894; p < 0.001). This trend remained at the 6- and 12-months follow-up (OR = 0.98; [0.96/0.99], p = 0.005 and (OR = 0.11; [0.01/0.70], p = 0.019 respectively) (Figure 2).  4.",53bf051b-4081-4ddb-b49e-4d64226c2d1c
11,methods11," Discussion  Our results showed a decrease of cardiovascular risk (CVR) associated with a better adherence to the MetDiet resulting in higher HDL-C and ucOC levels in MetS patients. SerumucOC showed an association with HDL-C levels after one year of follow-up and seems to be a potential biomarker to classify cardiovascular risk (CVR) in the MetS population, especially for MetS patients without prevalent T2D. Finally, circulating ucOC appears to be a good predictor for the risk of developing T2D in MetS patients. Patients with ucOC levels below the 25th percentile showed six times more of possibility of suffering T2D and these results were confirmed at the 6- and 12-month follow-up. The reversion of MetS factors and the reduction of cardiovascular risk (CVR) through lifestyle habit improvement have been largely documented [38,39]. In this cohort of MetS patients an increase of mean MedDiet adherence score and a slight reduction of sedentary activities is observed.",95ffbc24-3e06-4ebb-97f3-ee1181269f6e
12,methods12," The consumption of olive oil and nuts is associated with the increase of HDL-C levels which correlates with ucOC levels during the follow-up, as previously reported in some studies [47,48,49].  Our results point to ucOC as a potential biomarker capable of stratifying cardiovascular risk (CVR) in MetS patients. In this way, our results show a strong association between cardiovascular risk factors (cardiovascular risk (CVR)Fs) and circulating ucOC and observing significative lower levels of ucOC in those MetS patients presenting higher cardiovascular risk (CVR). Considering the close association of serum ucOC levels with cardiovascular risk (CVR)Fs, we evaluated its role as a predictor of cardiovascular risk (CVR) in our study population. Our results showed that serum ucOC level is an independent estimator of cardiovascular risk (CVR) adjusting for lifestyle variables and pharmacologic treatment at baseline.",db165a6d-2151-46af-b3e2-6b84478aa60b
13,methods13," This association was stronger when patients with prevalent T2D were excluded from the analysis since glucose levels are the main regulators on energy [50,51,52,53] and the presence of diabetes is the main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) rather than circulating ucOC. Agreeing with our results, other studies have previously reported the association between the individual cardiovascular risk (CVR) factors and total OC and ucOC [48,54,55]; however, this is the first study that shows an association with a total score of cardiovascular risk based on the MetS factors.  In order to validate the cut-off point established in our retrospective study as a threshold for stratifying cardiovascular risk (CVR) [43], the cardiometabolic profile of the study patients was analyzed during the follow-up period according to the cut-off point of 2.53 ng/mL ucOC.",d7946e14-0779-4cfc-8c2f-f6e4ea1a6681
14,methods14," Our results showed an association between lower ucOC levels and worse cardiometabolic profile and, thus, with higher cardiovascular risk (CVR) in terms of CV-ZS score during the whole follow-up period. Similar results were reported in a cohort of elderly men, showing a positive correlation between higher ucOC/OC ratio and lower incidence of myocardial infarction [56].  The better results in terms of improvement of cardiovascular risk (CVR) associated with higher HDL-C and lower ucOC levels were found at the 6-month follow-up when the participants were more aware of the intervention program. However, the strength of ucOC as a predictor variable of cardiovascular risk (CVR) was weaker at this point since the proportion of patients with values of circulating ucOC lower than 2.53 ng/mL was very low due to the improvement of lifestyle habits. Nevertheless, a relaxation in lifestyle habits was observed after 12 months of follow-up, thus the number of patients with values of ucOC below 2.",6ed3b50d-5013-44ab-a693-da3259a373d8
15,methods15,"53 ng/mL was raised again and the predictive value of serum ucOC for cardiovascular risk (CVR) was nearly significant.  Based on the close association between ucOC and cardiovascular risk (CVR)Fs, recent studies carried out in animal models have reported its effectiveness in vitro as a therapeutic treatment on atherosclerosis, showing an increase on capillary density and neovascularization and improving myocardial fibrosis [57,58].  Finally, the assessment of the usefulness of circulating uCOC for prediction of T2D risk in MetS patients positioned the ucOC as a powerful predictive strategy. Since MetS patients show an important heterogeneity, some of them may suffer higher glycemic disturbance, thus they will be at higher risk of T2D. Our results showed that patients with baseline levels below the cut-point of 2.53 ng/mL showed six times more of a risk of T2D. These results were confirmed at the 6- and 12-month follow-up, agreeing with previous findings [59].",97b76b7f-77d1-49a9-abce-d38741c3e494
16,methods16," These findings suggest that the measurement of serum ucOC levels could represent a promising screening tool in order to classify MetS individuals at high risk of developing T2D.  However, this study has some limitations. On the one hand, it is an observational study, so there is a possible residual confounding in the results due to a classification bias introduced by the self-reported data. On the other hand, because it is a population with cardiovascular risk (CVR), it could lead to a social desirability bias, increasing the score on the lifestyle scales. In addition, total OC, N-MID OC, vitamin D and K, which may have an influence on serum ucOC values, were not determined.",ab2597ce-4ebd-4e21-92e6-17d9a6f4b645
17,methods17," However, it should be noted that the main strength of this study is the novel assessment of cardiovascular risk (CVR) in patients with MetS using a global score of the accepted variables for the diagnosis of MetS, which allows a more accurate characterization of cardiovascular risk (CVR) in this heterogeneous population. Additionally, in contrast to other studies, confounding factors have been considered such as the presence of T2D and the pharmacological treatment for the management of MetS. This is therefore the first study to show the relationship between serum ucOC levels and the global cardiovascular risk (CVR) in this population. Furthermore, its considerable sample size and therefore its statistical power provides robustness to our results. Another strength is the longitudinal design, as the 12-month follow-up allows us to establish a causal relationship between weight loss due to the improvement of lifestyle and the decrease of cardiovascular risk (CVR) in MetS patients.",ce858d9e-7c92-4038-80e7-2fbe7cd902da
18,methods18,"  In conclusion, at the one year follow-up, it was shown that the improvement of lifestyle in a sample of MetS patients may have a double effect on their cardiometabolic health: on one hand through anthropometric changes and the improvement of MetS parameters, and on the other hand, by the increase of ucOC levels, which improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity by its action on beta pancreatic cells. Thus, ucOC is postulated as a good biomarker to classify T2D and cardiometabolic risk in such a heterogeneous population as MetS patients and to initiate early intervention in those at higher risk.
