Midday Napping and Successful Aging Of the 2564 participants of the Mediterranean Islands Study (MEDIS) study, 74% reported midday napping. Midday nappers were 56% males and 44% of females (p = 0.02). Table 1 illustrates participants’ characteristics according to midday napping behavior and sex. Overall, compared to non-midday nappers, midday nappers had a 20% higher level of successful aging index (SAI) score (3.5 vs. 2.9, p = 0.001), were more likely to be physically active (p = 0.01), and to have higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (p = 0.02).",328fd0ee-0340-4f96-9dc7-d9f3edfe1922
10,methods11,"   As residual confounding may always exist in observational studies, Table 2 presents results from multi-adjusted, nested linear regression models that evaluated the association of midday napping on successful aging (outcome) among Mediterranean Islands Study (MEDIS) study participants, after taking into account various potential confounders. It was found that compared to non-midday nappers, participants who reported midday napping had 0.577 units (or 5.7%) higher successful aging index (SAI) score (p < 0.001), after adjusting only for age. This association remained significant, and became even stronger after adjusting for several lifestyle factors related to sleep, such as sex, smoking habits, coffee and tea consumption. Specifically, in the fully adjusted model 5, midday nappers had 6.7% higher successful aging index (SAI) score compared to the rest of the participants. When cognitive function was included in the models, the results did not show statistical significance (p > 0.05).",9f5eedec-74c3-40f5-918f-2eab1f6eb127

When smoking habits, as well as coffee and tea consumption, were included in the models, the aforementioned association became stronger, but the effect of midday napping among males became more prominent as compared to females. In particular, female midday nappers presented an increase of 6.2% ± 1.3% in successful aging index (SAI) score compared to non-midday nappers (p = 0.002), while male midday nappers had an increase of 7.4% in successful aging index (SAI) score (p < 0.001) (for sex comparisons, p < 0.001).

As it can be drawn from Figure 1, older old (i.e., over 80 years) midday nappers had 9-times higher odds of having “high” successful aging index (SAI) scores (p < 0.001) compared to their no midday napping counterparts; the effect of midday napping among younger individuals was less prominent (i.e., 1.9-times higher odds of having “high” successful aging index (SAI) scores, p < 0.001). Concerning the effect of marital status, widowed midday nappers had 14.8-times higher odds of having “high” successful aging index (SAI) scores (p < 0.",f29f3090-2722-4a1e-93b3-b82ed6c3329d

Further analysis was applied to assess the role of some lifestyle-related sleep behaviors, like coffee and tea drinking and alcohol consumption. It was found that compared to non-midday nappers, midday nappers who did not consume tea had 3.9-times higher odds of being in the upper 50% of successful aging index (SAI) score levels (p < 0.001). However, no significant association was observed for midday nappers who reported as tea drinkers (p = 0.40). Moreover, midday nappers who also reported as coffee drinkers had 2.",c4a8135b-6912-4d0a-9d6f-adcd3c6b5890

Then, successful aging index (SAI) was categorized into quartiles (i.e., <1.6, 1.6–2.6, 2.6–3.7, and >3.7) and the main characteristics of the participants were explored focused on the highest tertile (i.e., over 3.7). It was observed that participants belonging in the highest tertile of successful aging index (SAI) were mainly males (i.e., 64%), 22% of them were over 80 years of age, 71% were married (17% widowers/widows), and 72% were midday nappers. The total mean hours of sleeping per day was 8.02 ± 1.6. In Figure 3, the characteristics of the successful “aging” person are illustrated.  4. Discussion The present study aimed to evaluate the association between midday napping, sleeping hours (as a duration of sleep), and successful aging among older individuals living in the Mediterranean region. Our results, based on a large-scale, multi-center epidemiological study, revealed that midday napping was positively associated with higher levels of successful aging.",d472e179-8d51-46c7-bf8f-95327c222bd4
17,methods18," Stronger associations were observed in male midday nappers compared to females, in non-tea drinkers, but also among coffee drinkers. Alcohol consumption did not have any synergistic effect with midday napping on successful aging level of the participants. Moreover, age-group analyses showed that among >80-year-old, those who reported midday napping had almost 9-times higher odds of achieving “high” successful aging levels, as compared to non-midday nappers; this effect was less prominent among younger participants. Regarding duration of sleep, it was observed that the optimal hours of sleep in order to achieve the best possible successful aging level was 8.5 h/day. Those 8.5 h need not be all at night and there is an indication that it is more beneficial if they are not slept all together. Despite the limitations of the present cross-sectional, observational study, the presented findings revealed an important role of sleep behaviors, i.e.",d829567d-2db2-4bad-ad85-9c3978c7fd90
18,methods19,", midday napping, on successful aging in a Mediterranean population.   Mediterranean people were traditionally known for their low levels of heart disease. However, nowadays, the prevalence of heart disease in the Mediterranean region has increased, and could be attributed to many factors. One of the main factors is that Mediterranean eating habits, traditionally high in plant-based foods, are slowly deteriorating, while Western eating and lifestyle habits are becoming more prevalent [22]. Meanwhile, midday napping is a feature of normal life in Mediterranean and Latin American countries. Like many traditional lifestyle habits around the world, napping in the day has become less common because of globalization, new employment regimes, and a busier, more stressful lifestyle, especially in countries and regions with economic instability [23]. An interesting observation, however, is that midday nappers had better nutritional habits, i.e.",bffdf9f9-32f7-4172-b5f6-6d0cad0437f0
19,methods20,", they are better adherents of the Mediterranean diet compared to non-midday nappers. Therefore, it is suggested that the adherence to the Mediterranean diet may help to improve the quality of sleep or vice versa in older people [24], supporting a potential idea that lower adherence to traditional habits may lead to worse health and quality of life.   Sleep is a vital indicator of overall health and well-being, and it is estimated that humans spend up to 33% of their life asleep. Sleep habits and needs vary across ages and sex and are impacted by lifestyle behaviors and health [25]. Previous research has shown that sleep latency increases with age in females, whereas sleep efficiency decreases in both females and males [26]. Females usually report worse quality and disrupted sleep across the ages. This could be attributed to sex steroids in sleep modulation [27].",3b369bb7-3c41-445f-9885-e1e44e28d2c0
20,methods21," In the present study, it was found that midday napping affects both males and females positively, but there were still some differences between them. This is further supported by Madrid-Valero et al [28], who, after examining 2144 individuals from Spain, found that not only age is inversely associated with quality of sleep, but also that quality of sleep varies by sex, with females following a steady worsening in sleep quality [28]. Additionally, another study examining the association between circadian alignment and body mass index (BMI), body fat, and obesity-related behaviors revealed that circadian alignment was associated with dietary intake, while a sex difference between the previously mentioned association was suggested [29].   Married people usually sleep together with their spouse, while divorced or widowed people sleep alone. There is evidence suggesting that “sleep divorce”, i.e., sleeping in a separate bed to your partner, may benefit both health and quality of life.",a3b143e2-5df4-422b-ac04-9f54d02f55cb
21,methods22," According to a survey conducted in 2000 Americans, almost half of the respondents reported that they prefer to sleep alone, while 19% blamed their partner for their poor sleep [30]. A cross-sectional study of 405 couples aged between 51 and 94 years in the United States also identified a negative impact of spousal sleep problems with their partner’s health and well-being [31]. Widowhood and divorce are usually distressing and disturbing events in life, but the level of sleep disturbance may vary. These could be potential reasons why widowed midday nappers presented higher levels of successful aging index (SAI) compared to non-midday napping counterparts, as well as married or never-married individuals, or even those divorced.   Sleep is usually regulated by two body systems, i.e., sleep/wake homeostasis and the circadian rhythm [32]. However, stimulants such as coffee, tea, energy and soft drinks, or even alcohol may interfere with the circadian rhythm [33].",616c0040-9c8a-408c-8b66-f06daa187882
22,methods23," Alcohol has a soporific effect; as blood alcohol levels decrease, the rate of arousal increases [34]. In addition, caffeine has psychoactive effects, and may reduce total sleep time and sleep quality if consumed later in the day [35]. However, in the present study, it was found that midday napping was associated with higher levels of successful aging among coffee and no-tea drinkers. In a recent study by Spadola et al., [36], examining the night-to-night association of evening use of alcohol and caffeine among others with sleep behaviors, it was observed that alcohol disrupted sleep, but caffeine seemed to have no effect [36]. Moreover, results from the Mediterranean Islands Study (MEDIS) study have previously shown that tea consumption and, more specifically, green but not black tea consumption may enhance successful aging [37].",ca71aa68-68b5-42e0-8ef5-369422132289
23,methods24,"   The fact that middle-aged individuals spend many hours working and their sleep duration is usually short has been associated with a variety of health consequences in older age, such as decreased physical functioning [28], a component of successful aging. According to the National Sleep Foundation, sleep duration recommendations for older adults, in order to avoid serious health problems or maintain health and well-being, range from 7 to 8 h/day [38]. This was supported by a study of older Chinese people who slept less than 6 h or more than 7 h/day, and had lower odds of successful aging [39]. In the present study, however, it was found that 8.5 h (not necessarily slept all together) seems to be the optimal sleeping hours for older Mediterranean people to achieve successful aging. As Chaput et al. [40] suggest, sleep needs are determined by several genetic, environmental and behavioral factors, and sleep duration should be personalized based on these factors [40].",b7e69126-fdb6-40c5-b395-a075d4b5cb33
24,methods25," It is also suggested that longer sleep has been associated with mental health problems in older people [41]; however, people living in the Mediterranean region traditionally practice napping in the day and therefore increase their overall duration of sleep without necessarily acquiring health-related problems. In general, older people tend to go to sleep earlier and wake earlier than younger adults for a number of different reasons, such as insomnia and sleep apnea, which are the most common sleep problems among older people [42]. A survey in older African-American people from disadvantaged financial areas of South Los Angeles revealed that insomnia symptoms co-exist with many mental, physical, and financial challenges and that sleep could be one of the ways to cope with these challenges [43].",0c6b71d8-e883-42d8-89e2-82a722cafe47
25,methods26," Sleep apnea can also cause other problems as well, such as memory loss, high blood pressure, or even stroke [44], and all of these problems affect the quality of life of older people, their sleep duration, and therefore their course of aging.   Sleep is essential for health and quality of life. However, sleep is actually a complex phenomenon, similarly to successful aging. For that reason, it is vital to understand the underlying causes of sleep problems and to identify and overcome age-related sleep problems to promote the quality of sleep and, therefore, the quality of everyday life. Adequate sleep may improve mental health so as to maintain mental functionality and physical performance throughout the day, and may help to avoid chronic conditions such as depression and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Thus, midday napping, as well as restful sleep during the night hours, should be highly promoted to increase odds of successful aging and mental and physical functionality.",149de122-0c16-42e2-ae20-79816b0d2457
26,methods27," Nowadays, an increasing number of people tend to spend time exposed to blue light watching television or using a computer, which can potentially cause sleep deprivation and consequently affect their quality of sleep [45]. Electronic devices which emit blue light are commonly used in the hours before sleep, decreasing melatonin and increasing alertness [46]. As such, the role of frequent use of technology in the evening hours on sleep quality and successful aging represents an important area of future research.  To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to evaluate the associations of midday napping on successful aging in older people living in the Mediterranean region. However, the conclusion of the present study should be considered under the existing limitations. The observational nature of the cross-sectional design does not allow for causal associations to be drawn. Moreover, blood evaluation and genetic evaluation of biological age were not feasible.",7e010ae6-91ed-4f9d-836a-0b27b36f326f
27,methods28," Sleeping behaviors and hours of sleep were not evaluated via actigraphy, but were based on questionnaires, and thus recall bias may exist. Finally, successful aging was not evaluated through cognitive behavior, neither was mobility nor physical function of the participants. These factors often characterize successful aging, along with low probability of disease and active engagement with life, and this may constitute another limitation. However, the successful aging index, used in this work, has already been validated [14].  5. Conclusions Sleep is an essential component of a healthy lifestyle, with both short and long duration of sleep associated with various morbidities and higher mortality. However, the effect of midday napping has rarely been investigated, especially regarding the successful aging process. As reported here, midday napping was independently associated with higher levels of successful aging, whereas 8.",2a37a158-1b7c-4144-ba6b-c48570c4211f
