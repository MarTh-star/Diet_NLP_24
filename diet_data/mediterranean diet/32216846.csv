Available from: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020218784 (accessed on 23 February 2021).  2.1. Searching Strategy  A comprehensive search was conducted in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library), searching all years of record up until October 2020. The language restriction was English and Spanish.",89f8c9bb-228d-434f-b338-a833991085af
1,methods1," Search terms were categorized into 3 key concepts: study population, high density lipoproteins (HDL) modulation, and nutritional intervention; specific terms used were: (adult OR “middle-aged” OR young OR m?n OR wom?n OR obese OR healthy) AND (“Mediterranean diet” OR “olive oil”) AND (“high density lipoproteins (HDL) remodel*” or “high density lipoproteins (HDL) function*” OR “high density lipoproteins (HDL) dysfunction*” OR “high density lipoproteins (HDL) change” OR “high density lipoproteins (HDL) component”), respectively. Whereas, reference lists of retrieved articles were manually searched for relevant publications (Table 1).  2.2.",f79d57c9-8b55-408a-8ddc-e3f2d1015bbe
2,methods2," Selection Criteria  Published studies included in this review were require to adhere to the following criteria: (1) original research; (2) adult human studies; (3) articles including high density lipoproteins (HDL) changes in composition, high density lipoproteins (HDL) component modifications or high density lipoproteins (HDL) functionality changes; (4) dietary intervention with MD or MD-related foods; (5) obese, dyslipidemic and healthy humans.  2.3. Data Extraction and Reliability  The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta analysis (PRISMA) recommendations were followed. Firstly, titles were screened and abstracts were analyzed in order to identify relevant articles. Then, articles chosen were downloaded and reviewed in detail by different researchers.  3. Results  3.1. Search and Selection of Studies  The searching and selection strategies are detailed in Figure 1.",30b064cf-2d27-418b-b0f4-c68326ab2475
3,methods3," A total of 55 records were identified through database searching and 38 through other sources, search of reference list of retrieved articles. Duplicates were removed and a set of 34 records were left to select the ones to be screened. From these 34, 7 records were excluded due to article type and 27 records were susceptible of full-text assessment. Consequently, 13 records were excluded with criteria, and 14 records were assessed for eligibility. Finally, 1 record was excluded because of the methodology used and 13 records were analyzed.  3.2. Comparison between Studies  Nine different study populations have been found in the records chosen, whereas, ten nutritional interventions were studied (Table 2). Two records studied the same 296 individuals with three nutritional interventions [13,14]. Otherwise, after the interventions, Hernaez et al., 2019, made an evaluation of foods consumed by 196 individuals from the initial study population, in order to create different groups [13].",b2e985db-e164-4bf3-ba8c-22b1e2118bb7
4,methods4," Individuals in each study population were different between studies, healthy individuals were included in a total of 5 study populations [15,16,17,18,19], and the rest of the study populations included high cardiovascular risk individuals, which suffered from dyslipidemia, obesity or hypercholesterolemia [13,14,20,21,22,23,24,25].  Intervention time varied between studies. The longest intervention time was 1 year [13,14] and the shortest 4 days [17].  3.3. high density lipoproteins (HDL) Functionality Modulation  A set of 7 records measured cholesterol efflux capacity (cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC)), cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) measurements were conducted on THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages [13,14,15,18,20], on J-774A.1 macrophages [22,23,24,25] and on primary cultures [19].",1c0045ce-09c2-43e6-a616-29291b1a999c
5,methods5," PON, lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT)), and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)) activities were determined in a set of 5 [13,14,16,20,22,23,24,25], 3 [15,16,22,23,24,25] and 4 [13,14,15,16] populations, respectively, by enzymatic activity measurements.  Specific MD-related foods were able to modulate high density lipoproteins (HDL) functions (Table 3). An increase of cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) was showed after virgin OO (virgin OO (VOO)), whole grains and nuts [13] eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) [20] and extra virgin OO (VOO) [18] consumption compared to baseline. Enzyme activity was variable after different interventions: cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity was decreased by diets enriched with legumes, fish and virgin OO (VOO) [13].",5903f3bb-8685-4c2a-b82c-b14173c398da
6,methods6," PON1 activity was increased by nut, legume and fish enriched diets [13], eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) consumption [20], lycopene rich and supplemented diets [16] and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T)) intervention [22,23,24,25]. lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity increased with lycopene supplemented diets [16]. Although there was no change after virgin OO (VOO), functional virgin OO (VOO) (Fvirgin OO (VOO) and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T)) interventions in lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity, it was significantly higher after functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T) in comparison with virgin OO (VOO) intervention [22,23,24,25].  3.4.",32eade5f-a256-455b-a672-79030ec44af6
7,methods7," high density lipoproteins (HDL) Oxidation  high density lipoproteins (HDL)s are affected by oxidative modifications and the fatty acids contained in high density lipoproteins (HDL)-associated lipids are the most susceptible components to oxidation. high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation state (Table 4) is related to high density lipoproteins (HDL) functionality. high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation rate was measured as equivalents of malondialdehyde production [14,19], and other high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation-related parameters were measured by Hernaez et al. 2017: high density lipoproteins (HDL) capacity to prevent low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) oxidation and high density lipoproteins (HDL) resistance to oxidation in a pro-oxidant environment [14].",56bfa4c3-dd2e-4e6d-80d4-ed7d22fb799b
8,methods8," After a virgin OO (VOO)-enriched traditional MD, high density lipoproteins (HDL) antioxidant properties were improved, lower high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation rate, higher high density lipoproteins (HDL) resistance to oxidation and higher prevention of low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation were found [14]. In addition, linoleic supplemented diet showed capacity to reduce high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation rate compared to lycopene rich diet [19].  high density lipoproteins (HDL) antioxidant properties were measured after different virgin OO (VOO) interventions (virgin OO (VOO), Fvirgin OO (VOO) and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T)) [22,23,24,25]. However, no change was found in high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation rate, high density lipoproteins (HDL) resistance to oxidation and glutathione peroxidase activity.",87c936ba-d42c-4e1f-93c0-67ee9053f8d5
9,methods9," To highlight, high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation rate was measured as white blood cells production of dihydrorhodamine 123 [22].  3.5. high density lipoproteins (HDL) Monolayer Fluidity  high density lipoproteins (HDL) monolayer fluidity was analyzed by a determination of steady-state anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,4-hexatriene (diphenyl 1 3 4 hexatriene (DHP)) (Table 5). High-polyphenol content olive oil (High polyphenol content olive oil (HPCOO)) [15] and extra virgin OO (VOO) [18] consumption were found to increase high density lipoproteins (HDL) monolayer fluidity. However, different virgin OO (VOO) interventions (virgin OO (VOO), Fvirgin OO (VOO) and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T)) did not show effect over high density lipoproteins (HDL) monolayer fluidity [22,23,24,25].",19e4f8d5-1324-4e6a-b67b-823d2790e0c9
10,methods10,"  Correlation models between high density lipoproteins (HDL) monolayer fluidity and high density lipoproteins (HDL) functionality-related parameters found that free high density lipoproteins (HDL)-C and triglyceride contents and high density lipoproteins (HDL) size were the main determinants of high density lipoproteins (HDL) monolayer fluidity [23].  3.6. high density lipoproteins (HDL) Composition  high density lipoproteins (HDL) lipidome is modulated by diet, even by a short-time dietary intervention. After two 4-day dietary interventions, high density lipoproteins (HDL) lipidome was widely modulated and fatty acids contained in high density lipoproteins (HDL) phospholipids were the most variable lipids by diet [17]. The 4-day MD intervention increased the quantity of phosphatidylcholine with very long chain and double bonds fatty acids, compared to baseline and to the 4-day fast food diet intervention.",511d66bb-89b7-4897-bcfb-b1984973b04a
11,methods11," Fatty acid length, which was found to increase after the 4-day MD intervention, was directly related to monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) consumption [17]. In addition, an oleic acid rich diet, as MD, increased oleic acid and its derivatives in high density lipoproteins (HDL) phospholipids [19,23]. A linoleic acid rich diet increased linoleic high density lipoproteins (HDL) quantity, but linoleic acid binding capacity was lower than oleic acid [19].  Phenolic compounds contained in OO were found to present ability to bind to high density lipoproteins (HDL) particles. high density lipoproteins (HDL) showed higher phenolic compounds after High polyphenol content olive oil (HPCOO) intervention [15] and after virgin OO (VOO), Fvirgin OO (VOO) and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T) diets [23], specifically α-tocopherol, β-cryptoxanthin and coenzyme Q [23].",6d03c8b3-9ef7-4309-a59d-36fafbd896b0
12,methods12," Lycopene rich and supplemented diets modulated high density lipoproteins (HDL) composition, higher high density lipoproteins (HDL) lycopene quantity was found after lycopene interventions [16].  high density lipoproteins (HDL) proteome showed to be influenced by nutritional interventions. After three interventions with virgin OO (VOO) (virgin OO (VOO), Fvirgin OO (VOO) and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T)), the high density lipoproteins (HDL) proteome was remodeled: 15 high density lipoproteins (HDL) metabolism-related proteins were identified as the most importantly modulated after the interventions, including PON3, apolipoprotein (apo)-AI, apoA-II and apoD [25]. However, no change in apo-AI quantity was found after interventions with High polyphenol content olive oil (HPCOO), LPCOO [15] and lycopene [16].",7b7ebca0-389c-4304-8590-b0ceac7eff56
13,methods13," While, higher apo-AI quantity was found after a traditional MD-enriched diet enriched with nuts and virgin OO (VOO) [14] and after three diets with virgin OO (VOO) (virgin OO (VOO), Fvirgin OO (VOO) and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T)) compared to baseline [25].  3.7. high density lipoproteins (HDL) Size  high density lipoproteins (HDL) size range between 8–10 nm of diameter and two groups are defined in terms of high density lipoproteins (HDL) size: large and small, also named as high density lipoproteins (HDL)3 and high density lipoproteins (HDL)2, respectively. The effect of different OO interventions on high density lipoproteins (HDL) size is shown in Table 6. Large high density lipoproteins (HDL) number was found to be increased after a MD enriched with virgin OO (VOO) and with nuts [14] and after High polyphenol content olive oil (HPCOO) [15] consumption.",17b185cb-3e18-4ec5-a529-c78834898387
14,methods14," In addition, High polyphenol content olive oil (HPCOO) consumption showed to decrease small high density lipoproteins (HDL) number. When High polyphenol content olive oil (HPCOO) consumption is compared with LPCOO, large high density lipoproteins (HDL) number was increased and small high density lipoproteins (HDL) number decreased [15]. However, different virgin OO (VOO) enriched with polyphenols (Fvirgin OO (VOO) and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T)) showed to decrease large high density lipoproteins (HDL) number and to increase small high density lipoproteins (HDL) number [22,23,24,25]. On the other hand, extra virgin OO (VOO) did not show capacity to modulate high density lipoproteins (HDL) size [18].  4. Discussion  high density lipoproteins (HDL)-C is clinically considered a Cardiovascular disease (CVD) protective factor.",7f9dc35a-4460-4252-a6b2-a17509ff07e3
15,methods15," However, pharmacological strategies that led to an increase in high density lipoproteins (HDL)-C did not reduce Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk [26]. The lack of effect of high density lipoproteins (HDL)-C raising strategies puts into question high density lipoproteins (HDL)-C concentrations as a protective factor against Cardiovascular disease (CVD). high density lipoproteins (HDL)-C should be in the spotlight as a Cardiovascular disease (CVD) lowering risk factor and high density lipoproteins (HDL) modulations should be considered in order to predict Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk [3].  high density lipoproteins (HDL) composition is demonstrated to change in different physiological and pathological conditions [27,28]. Diseases associated to higher Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, such as obesity and diabetes, remodel high density lipoproteins (HDL) composition and functionality.",1e488003-550d-402d-a924-e810b4b190a3
16,methods16," Diabetic people showed glycosylated and oxidized high density lipoproteins (HDL)s that presented lower high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [29]. Moreover, lifestyle remodels high density lipoproteins (HDL)s and influences on their biological activities. In particular, unhealthy diets contribute to the development of dysfunctional high density lipoproteins (HDL)s, even in people without diseases [27]. In addition, healthy diets such as MD, have shown capacity to remodel high density lipoproteins (HDL) functionality even in pathological conditions, like obesity [28].  In a whole view of the data analyzed in this review, MD showed capacity to produce changes in high density lipoproteins (HDL) by modulating high density lipoproteins (HDL) functionality, oxidation, composition, and size.",15c803d9-b67d-4dec-8f7d-71e7eed9428f
17,methods17," MD-induced changes in high density lipoproteins (HDL) are variable between records analyzed and not all data were comparable because the same measurements were not always performed. This variability could be influenced by population differences, healthy and high cardiovascular risk populations. Moreover, despite all records performed interventions with MD, different foods or dietary patterns were used in each record, which may contribute to different changes in high density lipoproteins (HDL)s, highlighting the need for greater consistency between studies in the amount of foods and nutrients administered as part of a MD. Interestingly, intervention time in the studies included in this review was found not to be a limiting factor, because even after short interventions high density lipoproteins (HDL) were remodeled.",0207c93f-a765-4ba8-9d8c-6273e78e38ca
18,methods18," Several studies were conducted over different samples of the PREDIMED population, which demonstrated that high density lipoproteins (HDL) are widely altered by diet and that MD improves high density lipoproteins (HDL) quality [13,14,21].  A set of 5 studies made an intervention with virgin OO (VOO) [13,14,18], OO or components isolated from OO, specifically polyphenols [15,22,23,24,25] and oleic acid [19]. high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) was the most OO-enhanced high density lipoproteins (HDL) function [13,14,15,18,22,23,24,25], due, at least in part, to OO polyphenols [15,22,23,24,25]. cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) was not significantly decreased after OO interventions, with the exception of a traditional MD-enriched with virgin OO (VOO) [14]. However, when the study population was subdivided, the new virgin OO (VOO) group did not show changes in cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity [13].",27e0e385-03db-4446-8d01-25faf55a48be
19,methods19," lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity showed significant change only after functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T) when compared to virgin OO (VOO) [22,23,24,25], which suggests that lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity is specially modulated by polyphenols. However, a High polyphenol content olive oil (HPCOO) diet did not increase lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity, against baseline neither against LPCOO [15]. In addition, lycopene rich and supplemented diets were the only interventions that showed an improvement of lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity compared to baseline [16]. functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T) differs from Fvirgin OO (VOO) and High polyphenol content olive oil (HPCOO) in that it is enriched in thyme polyphenols. Thus, lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity may be susceptible to thyme polyphenols when compared to other OO and OO polyphenols.",b3d418ae-0a50-4350-9cd0-641167d7bf64
20,methods20,"  In regards to antioxidant functions of high density lipoproteins (HDL), a traditional MD enriched with virgin OO (VOO) and an oleic acid enriched diet lowered high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation [14,19], but no significant change in oxidation rate was found after phenol enriched virgin OO (VOO) diets (Fvirgin OO (VOO) and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T)). However, PON1 activity was higher after a functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T) intervention [22,23,24,25], but no significant change was found after a traditional MD enriched with virgin OO (VOO) [14]. functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T) was demonstrated to increase high density lipoproteins (HDL) antioxidant function but not to alter high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation rate. On one hand, a traditional MD enriched with virgin OO (VOO) decreased high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation but did not change PON1 activity.",c2979986-aa7e-4313-ba0c-9bc20805ff1d
21,methods21," PON1 is not the only high density lipoproteins (HDL) antioxidant component, so the reduction on high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation rate described after a traditional MD-enriched with virgin OO (VOO) could be due to other high density lipoproteins (HDL) antioxidant components, or to a MD-induced lower pro-oxidant environment, which in addition to virgin OO (VOO) leads to lower high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation rate. On the other hand, PON1 activity could be increased by the higher presence of polyphenols on functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T), not altering other high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation parameters or the environment. The study population is not widely differential between interventions, since high cardiovascular risk people were included in both.",7abb0291-356e-47c3-b0d8-cfb5ed2f7d09
22,methods22," However, the number of participants in the traditional MD enriched with virgin OO (VOO) intervention was higher compared to the intervention with functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T), and the high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation rate was differently measured. It would be necessary to determine high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation rate after Fvirgin OO (VOO) and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T) interventions as malondialdehyde production to be able to compare.  A High polyphenol content olive oil (HPCOO) diet and an extra virgin OO (VOO) intervention increased high density lipoproteins (HDL) fluidity [15,18]. There was no change in high density lipoproteins (HDL) monolayer fluidity in phenol enriched virgin OO (VOO) (functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T) and Fvirgin OO (VOO)) and virgin OO (VOO) diets [22,23,24,25].",baf715b9-7d5b-48d4-80fa-95c23aaf19ab
23,methods23," Opposed evidences are exposed in terms of virgin OO (VOO) and polyphenols influence on high density lipoproteins (HDL) monolayer fluidity. However, it is important to highlight that there were differences between the study populations. When the study population was healthy, high density lipoproteins (HDL) monolayer fluidity was increased by OO, but no change was found when the study population was hypercholesterolemic. OO does not benefit high density lipoproteins (HDL) monolayer fluidity when hypercholesterolemia is present.  Taken all data together, OO showed ability to modulate high density lipoproteins (HDL) functionality, and polyphenols may be very influencing components. Despite controversial results were found in high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation and monolayer fluidity, and the missing data of some enzyme activities, high density lipoproteins (HDL) functions could be modulated by OO. The remodeling pattern needs to be clarified, suggesting the need for further research.",28028c84-2d52-437e-a362-182951a3e294
24,methods24,"  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an essential fatty acid, which has showed anti-inflammatory functions (complete). Fish is an eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-rich food highly consumed in MD. An eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) enriched diet showed ability to increase high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) and PON1 activity [20]. In addition, a traditional MD enriched with fish increased high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) and PON1 activity and decreased cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity [13]. Dyslipidemia did not alter eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-related high density lipoproteins (HDL) functionality improvement.",1cdf5791-e0c8-4997-9582-15a0c8f10b3f
25,methods25," Whereas, the data is not contradictory compared to interventions with virgin OO (VOO) enriched with polyphenols (Fvirgin OO (VOO) and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T)) in hypercholesterolemia, because PON1 activity and cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) were improved after functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T) intervention and virgin OO (VOO), Fvirgin OO (VOO) and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T), respectively. It would be interesting to study the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in hypercholesterolemic population over high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation rate as malondialdehyde production, to clarify if high Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk population is not susceptible to improve high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation rate by diet.  All records in which high density lipoproteins (HDL) compositional change was analyzed, high density lipoproteins (HDL) composition was modulated by a MD.",bf918afc-7750-48c0-8ae4-465c8b33ba3c
26,methods26," high density lipoproteins (HDL) seem to be susceptible to the kind of lipid consumed. high density lipoproteins (HDL) lipid composition was enriched on dietary lipids. However, there is not a high density lipoproteins (HDL) composition change pattern by MD and no correlations could be made between high density lipoproteins (HDL) composition and high density lipoproteins (HDL) functionality.  high density lipoproteins (HDL) do not only vary in composition and functionality, they are subdivided by size in different types of high density lipoproteins (HDL)s. high density lipoproteins (HDL) size is variable due to high density lipoproteins (HDL) metabolism, since high density lipoproteins (HDL)s bind different components and modulate their size, as a result of high density lipoproteins (HDL) synthesis and catabolism, and it is also reflected in the high density lipoproteins (HDL) functions.",c7e5fcef-584a-48c7-a76e-1b19a9a67bac
27,methods27," high density lipoproteins (HDL) type in terms of size seems to influence Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Owing to the relation between high density lipoproteins (HDL) size and high density lipoproteins (HDL) functionality development, MD could change high density lipoproteins (HDL) size distribution. Results found by different researches are controversial, since virgin OO (VOO) and nuts enriched diets increased large high density lipoproteins (HDL) quantity [14], and a High polyphenol content olive oil (HPCOO) intervention increased large high density lipoproteins (HDL) quantity and decreased small high density lipoproteins (HDL) quantity, compared to baseline and to a LPCOO diet [15]. Nevertheless, two diets based on virgin OO (VOO) enriched with polyphenols (Fvirgin OO (VOO) and functional virgin OO (VOO) with thyme (Fvirgin OO (VOO)T)) showed to have the contrary effect [22,23,24,25].",34b2e290-7e30-4757-a03b-4b7a96a95ee9
28,methods28," high density lipoproteins (HDL) size could be differently modulated when the study population is hypercholesterolemic, since hypercholesterolemia could alter OO benefits over high density lipoproteins (HDL) functionality.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, this systematic review shows that MD influences high density lipoproteins (HDL) functionality, composition, and size. high density lipoproteins (HDL) functionality is improved by MD, in terms of enzymatic activity and cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), also high density lipoproteins (HDL) antioxidant properties are improved, as high density lipoproteins (HDL) oxidation is reduced. There is a need to clarify MD-derived modulation of high density lipoproteins (HDL) size to determine high density lipoproteins (HDL) components which fundamentally are influenced by MD. In addition, further research is needed to determine MD specific food high density lipoproteins (HDL)-modulating abilities and the effect of the global MD.",2e8787c4-0a78-48bb-8352-b8c5ab5d2bba
29,methods29," While, it would be interesting to clarify the MD abilities over healthy and hypercholesterolemic or dyslipidemic population separately. Taken together, MD has demonstrated to be an influencing factor over high density lipoproteins (HDL) quality, which indicate that MD could be a target to improve cardiovascular health via high density lipoproteins (HDL) modulation.
