0,methods0," 2.1. Participants  The number of primary school students who decided to participate in the study was 1113 (511 boys and 602 girls), aged between 9 and 12 years old (M = 10.78; SD = 0.66). The students were enrolled in different schools in the province of Burgos (Spain). Of the participants in the study: 671 were in public schools, 262 were in private schools and 180 were in state schools.  2.2. Measurements  Scale of Perceived Teacher Support [27]. It is a Likert-type scale (from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)) with two factors: autonomy support (12 items) and psychological control (7 items). This scale assesses, from the student’s perspective, perceived teacher support and control.  Scale of Perceived Support by Parents [27]. This is a Likert-type scale (from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)) with two factors: autonomy support (12 items) and psychological control (7 items).",653c8c41-c714-476f-9273-75e515930602
1,methods1," This scale assesses, from the student’s perspective, perceived parental support and control.  Scale of Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction in Physical Education [33]. This is a Likert-type scale (from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)) with four factors: competence (4 items), autonomy (4 items), novelty (6 items) and relatedness (4 items). This scale assesses, from the student’s perspective, basic psychological needs satisfaction in PE.  Scale of frustration of basic psychological needs in physical education [34]. It is a Likert-type scale (from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)) with four factors: competence (4 items), autonomy (4 items), novelty (5 items) and relatedness (4 items). This scale assesses, from the student’s perspective, basic psychological needs frustration in PE.  Motivation in physical education. The Spanish version is used to analyze student motivation [35].",12f7bb1f-f52e-491e-8162-a2f2f5e94e44
2,methods2," The scale is a Likert-type scale (from 1 (not true) to 7 (completely true)) with six factors: intrinsic motivation (4 items), integrated regulation (4 items), identified regulation (4 items), introjected regulation (4 items), external regulation (3 items) and amotivation (4 items). This scale assesses, from the student’s perspective, the motivation in physical education classes.  Social cognition and intention: The scale from the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), which has been used successfully in several studies [30,31], was used. The scale consists of four factors: subjective norm, intention, perceived behavioral control and attitude. The responses given by the students were on a Likert-type scale (strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7)), except for one item of the subjective norm factor (no control (1) to strong control (7)). This scale assesses, from the students’ perspective, their future behavioral predisposition towards balanced eating.",80cc4cee-98b1-429a-a71b-055a54daed01
3,methods3,"  Balanced diet: The Spanish version of the scale linked to the Mediterranean diet [36] was used. This scale consists of 16 items, with an overall score ranging from 0 to 12.  2.3. Procedure  Before starting the study, contact was made with the Bioethics Committee of the University of Almeria in order to obtain its approval. Once approval was obtained (Ref. UALBIO 2020/008), the management teams of various educational centers were contacted in order to obtain their collaboration in order to carry out the study and to inform them of the objectives of the study. Subsequently, contact was established with the students of the educational centers to request their participation in the study, for which they had to provide informed consent, detailing the objectives of the study, signed by the parents or legal guardians. The questionnaires were completed individually and on paper at the beginning of the PE lessons.",02a92c73-90d3-4c53-aa33-336e476826dd
4,methods4," In addition, a member of the research group was present to answer any questions from the participants.  The completion of the questionnaires took around 25 min, and all ethical procedures established in the Helsinki Declaration were respected at all times.  2.4. Data Analysis  In order to achieve the objectives of the study, several statistical analyses were necessary. First, the data were analyzed descriptively, calculating mean standard deviation and bivariate correlations. Subsequently, the reliability of the Cronbach’s Alpha, Omega coefficient and above 0 70 In terms of discriminant validity (AVE) factors were analyzed (Table 1). Finally, structural equation modelling was carried out in order to analyze the predictive relationships between the study factors. The statistical programs SPSS v25 and AMOS v22 were used for these analyses.",5e94b47e-5bb8-4a0c-a3e8-7a3d8e0776cc
5,methods5,"  The hypothesized model (Figure 1) was analyzed using the maximum likelihood method, as it takes into account the non-normal distribution of the data and is also the most suitable for Likert scales [37]. Next to the maximum likelihood method, a bootstrapping of 6000 interactions was used [38]. The following fit indices were used to define the model as good [39]: the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)), with its 90% confidence interval (CI), should have been found with values below 0.06, indicating an adequate and excellent fit. The incremental CFI (Comparative Fit Index), IFI (Incremental Fit Index) and TLI (Tucker–Lewis Index) with values above 0.95 were also considered adequate and excellent indices. The χ2/df index was considered adequate and excellent when it was between 2 and 3. Finally, the SRMR (Standardized Root Mean Square Residual) with values below 0.08 was also considered adequate and excellent.  3. Results  3.1.",0e0065f2-46ca-4863-b483-572e058bebbc
6,methods6," Descriptive Statistics, Reliability Analysis and Bivariate Correlations  Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations and reliability analysis. The correlations showed a positive score between those factors that showed a closer relationship, while those factors that were more distant showed a negative correlation. Reliability analysis through Cronbach’s alpha and the Omega coefficient showed a score above 0.70. In terms of discriminant validity (above 0 70 In terms of discriminant validity (AVE)), the score was above 0.60, reflecting the non-existence of overlap between the factors.  3.2. Structural Equation Model Analysis  The hypothesized models (Figure 1) tested through structural equation modelling were adequate: χ2 (301, n = 1113) = 867.78, χ2/df = 2.88, p < 0.001, TLI = 0.96, IFI = 0.96, CFI = 0.96, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.063.

7,methods7," The predictive relationship between each of the factors was examined through standardized regression weights, the results of which are as follows.  (1) Teacher-perceived interpersonal control style showed positive effects on psychological need frustration (β = 0.55, p < 0.01) and negative effects on basic psychological need satisfaction (β = −0.27, p < 0.01). In contrast, teacher autonomy support showed positive effects on basic psychological need satisfaction (β = −0.29, p < 0.01) and negative effects on psychological need frustration (β = 0.46, p < 0.001).  (2) Parental-perceived interpersonal control style showed positive effects on psychological need frustration (β = 0.44, p < 0.01) and negative effects on basic psychological need satisfaction (β = −0.31, p < 0.001). In contrast, parental autonomy support showed positive effects on basic psychological need satisfaction (β = 0.52, p < 0.01) and negative effects on psychological need frustration (β = −0.33, p < 0.001).",69883b4a-9765-4843-aaa7-6882bed21b94
8,methods8,"  (3) Frustration of psychological needs showed negative effects on motivation towards PE classes (β = −0.49, p < 0.01). However, satisfaction of psychological needs showed positive effects on motivation towards PE lessons (β = 0.71, p < 0.001).  (4) Motivation towards PE classes showed positive effects on attitudes (β = 0.29, p < 0.01), behavioral control (β = 0.37, p < 0.001), subjective norms (β = 0.41, p < 0.01) and intention (β = 0.61, p < 0.001).  (5) Intention to follow a healthy and balanced diet was positively predicted by attitudes (β = 0.28, p < 0.001), behavioral control (β = 0.42, p < 0.001) and subjective norms (β = 0.34, p < 0.01).  (6) Intention to follow a healthy and balanced diet showed positive effects on the Mediterranean diet (β = 0.46, p < 0.01).  4. Discussion  The present study aimed to analyze the influence of parents and the PE teacher on the basic psychological needs, motivation and intentional eating habits of school-aged children.",b78ebcd6-f0b0-4043-8f58-63fd948ee75b
9,methods9," In this sense, PE classes are a discipline that can be fundamental in order to strengthen future adaptive behaviors related to healthy and balanced eating [40,41,42]. However, the studies in the field of Primary Education are certainly laconic, focusing mainly on the effect of satisfying the psychological needs and motivation of students on the classroom climate (e.g., fun, boredom, etc.), ignoring the instrumental objective of the subject. In this sense, it is in childhood that many of the behaviors that will take place during adolescence and adulthood are established, which is why the present study focused on this stage [43].  The results of the study showed how the social context exerts a significant influence on the satisfaction and frustration of basic psychological needs, in such a way that support for autonomy has been positively related to satisfaction and negatively related to frustration, with psychological control being the opposite.",3cde3ee6-dab5-4de6-9491-80dd16da680c
10,methods10," These results are in accordance with the postulates of Self Determination Theory (SDT) [16] and with the results achieved in several studies in the context of Secondary Education [44,45], since in Primary Education, there is no evidence of these relationships presented in the present study. Thus, the results presented here highlight the negative influence that the social context can have on the perceptual development of the environment and the psychological development of young people [46]. It is therefore necessary to create a positive classroom climate based on personal introspection and less on external demands and pressures [47].  On the other hand, basic psychological needs were positively related to motivation, whereas psychological need frustration had a negative influence on motivation. These results are similar to several studies in the context of primary education, but only taking into account the variables of psychological need satisfaction and motivation [21,22].",3aa88311-3e13-4c98-9556-d48e08bd2ed5
11,methods11," However, in the context of Secondary Education, there are several studies that endorse the results achieved in the present study [47,48,49]. In this sense, a study conducted by Trigueros and Navarro [50], with secondary school students aged 12–16 years, showed that satisfaction of psychological needs positively predicted motivation, while frustration exerted a negative influence. These results are in line with the postulates of Self Determination Theory (SDT) [16], endorsing that if students are presented with achievable challenges, have a good classroom climate and have room for self-decision, they will be more receptive and involved in classroom dynamics [17].  In addition, the results showed that motivation towards PE lessons was positively related to attitude, subjective norms, behavioral control and intention, and this, in turn, was positively related to Mediterranean diet. It is difficult to compare these results with studies in primary education.",955d1ddb-ec38-4458-98c2-e501550c7549
12,methods12," However, at the secondary school level, studies have shown that a high internal motivation towards PE classes is positively related to attitude, intention to be physically active and adopting a positive predisposition towards the Mediterranean diet as a result of a positive mental representation of the Mediterranean diet. In this sense, a study conducted by Lirola et al. [51] in a population of adolescents showed how motivation towards PE classes has a positive influence on attitude, behavioral control and subjective norms, favoring healthy and balanced eating. In the same way, but with regard to the practice of physical activity, a study carried out in a population of adolescents by Trigueros et al. [8] analyzed how motivation towards PE classes was positively related to attitude, behavioral control and subjective norms, and, in turn, attitude, behavioral control and subjective norms showed a positive relationship with regard to the intention to practice PA.",4de5d90a-0372-4321-8342-1e8651c7b9be
13,methods13,"  However, the results achieved in the present study are not without a number of limitations: (a) the use of self-reported questionnaires severely limited the information to be captured, although it allowed for a greater amount of information to be collected from several subjects; (b) the population participating in the study came from the same geographical location, which limits the overall representativeness of the participants; (c) the present study ignored the influence of other factors, such as emotional factors, which play a fundamental role in the adoption of behaviour. In this sense, emotions play a precursor role to motivation in judging the facts of the environment.  5. Conclusions  The results shown in this study confirm the clear reciprocity between Self Determination Theory (SDT) and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB).",99a4b2c6-9e4e-43d2-85da-cf2b4eab2753
14,methods14," In this way, the influence of the social context is key in the perceptual–psychological development of young people and in the reinforcement of behaviurs related to the healthy and balanced diet that the Mediterranean diet represents.
