The results are summarized in  Tables 2 and 3. The highest activity was obtained with 20 mM Mg2+ in the presence of 0.5 mM EDTA (P < .05), which was routinely used.

13,results4,"  In order to study the effect of EDTA concentration on the Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity of human mesangial cell (HMC), microsomal fractions of human mesangial cell (HMC) 0.05 mg/mL were incubated in the presence of different concentrations of EDTA in a range of 0.01–10 mM, as well as in the presence of 20 mM Mg2+, in the reaction medium. As shown in  Figure 4, the maximum enzyme activity occurred at 0.5 mM EDTA final concentration in reaction medium, which was routinely used.  Concentration of EDTA of 10 mM abolished Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity.  In conclusion, the presence of 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 15mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 20 mM Mg2+, and 0.5 mM EDTA in the reaction medium of Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT assay resulted in maximum activity,  and was routinely used.  3.6.",690372ce-90c8-468a-8d37-6e0e2ecbe29a

Moreover, the characterization of Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT of human mesangial cell (HMC) was also performed for the first time. In order to evaluate  Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity of human mesangial cell (HMC), a new enzymatic assay procedure was achieved. In contrast with all previous reported enzymatic assays for the determination of Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT, (a) in this assay the amount of the added sample protein in the reaction mixture is much lower, giving the opportunity to detect Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity in samples with low protein distribution, (b) this assay does not need the use of radiolabeled compounds, reducing though the risk and expense of the procedure.",8dad3f57-9038-409d-a3cb-5d2476846cfa
18,discussion1,"  According to this assay, Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity was detected mainly in the microsomal fraction and its biochemical characteristics were found similar to previously published data from other groups in other types of cells and tissues  [7–12, 14, 15]. Specifically, Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity is significantly increased in the presence of specific concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA), dithiothreitol (DTT), Mg2+, and EDTA.  dithiothreitol (DTT) was added in reaction mixture in order to inhibit PC-CPT, as posphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis by its cholinephosphotransferase, PC-CPT, is known to be strongly inhibited at these dithiothreitol (DTT) concentrations  [8, 14]. Moreover, dithiothreitol (DTT) seems to increase Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity.",49507bd2-2d36-45eb-8f2b-e0860f058184
19,discussion2,"  In accordance to reported data, exogenous Mg2+ are essential for enzyme action, while exogenous Ca2+ exhibit a dose-dependent inhibitory effect that was partly abolished by the presence of EDTA. In several studies, various chelate reagents were used in order to reduce the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT  [8–12, 14]. It is well known that the chelate reagent EDTA prefers to bind to Ca2+ than to Mg2+ in the copresence of these divalent cations in the reaction medium.  In the absence of exogenous Ca2+, a small range of EDTA concentration, near 0.5 mM, enhances enzyme activity by primary binding endogenous Ca2+ than Mg2+. Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT of human mesangial cell (HMC) required a specific concentration of EDTA for its activation as both lower and higher concentrations result in its inactivation,  by either the inhibitory effect of the unbounded Ca2+ or by the reduction of Mg2+  levels from its binding with the EDTA excess, respectively.",0f708853-3dad-43bd-89a4-2f6772b141c3
20,discussion3," However, in these high concentrations of EDTA (up to 10 mM), it is possible that the inactivation of the enzyme  may be caused not only by the binding of Mg2+, but also by the effect of this chelate reagent directly on the enzyme.  In addition, Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to both its substrates,  alkyl 2 acetyl sn glycerol (AAG) and CDP-choline. The kinetic parameters of the enzyme  (K m and V max)  for both substrates were similar to reported ones in other tissues and cells  [7, 8, 14, 15].  On the other hand, pefabloc (a sulfonyl-type serine protease inhibitor) had no significant effect  on the enzyme action supporting the absence of serine(s) in the active site of the enzyme. Moreover, since Pefabloc is also Platelet activating factor (PAF) AH inhibitor [42], the formed Platelet activating factor (PAF) is not affected from the possible presence of Platelet activating factor (PAF)-AH.",0ecac384-d28e-44ed-aeec-5516d1fedfe3
21,discussion4,"  It has been reported that several other factors can regulate Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT, suggesting that this enzyme serves as an important control point in the de novo synthesis of Platelet activating factor (PAF) [7–12, 14]. For example, Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT forms a complex with membrane phospholipids and other protein molecules, while environmental membrane phospholipids seem to regulate this enzyme [11].  Moreover, the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and dopamine as well as the activators of protein kinase  C 12-myristate-13-acetate phorbol (phorbol (PMA)) and oleoylacetylglycerol (oleoylacetylglycerol (OAG))  (molecules that are implicated in several pathological situations) also stimulate the de novo Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT,  while they do not activate the enzymes of the remodelling pathway  [8, 9, 43,44].",b46ce5b8-9054-44ef-b1cb-705988cc02f3
22,discussion5,"  Although it is believed that the remodeling pathway is activated under inflammatory situations, the de novo pathway, and especially Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT, may contribute to systemic disorders such as cancer [13] and central nervous system failure [12], by a slightly long-term enhance of Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity that could lead to steady increased levels of Platelet activating factor (PAF), which subsequently maybe implicated in systemic disorders. These pathological situations may be reversed by inhibiting Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT, as it was reported in two studies where the reduction of Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity in human renal cell carcinoma (renal cell carcinoma (RCC)) in patients who had received IFNa, as well as in brain striatum of rats who had received CDP-choline,",f1fbb561-192b-41c8-8878-f89dd030add8
23,discussion6," resulted in reduced levels of Platelet activating factor (PAF) with beneficial effects (inhibition of tumor progression and various disorders of the central nervous system) in both cases [12, 13].  In this study, preliminary in vitro experiments were conducted in order to test the effects of several bioactive compounds of Mediterranean diet and various drugs, which are related to several manifestations where inflammation dominates  [26, 27, 31–41, 45, 46], on Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity. The results have revealed that the drugs Symvastatin and Rupatadine, and several bioactive compounds of Mediterranean diet, such as resveratrol (found also in wine) and polar lipids of olive oil, olive pomace, and sea bass, exhibit an inhibitory effect on Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT of human mesangial cell (HMC) in a dose-dependent manner.",fd4bfa8b-cd9b-4a73-a0cb-a6a3cce81f53
24,discussion7," Several other drugs such as INFa, Aspirin, and Tinzaparin, as also as other bioactive compounds of Mediterranean diet such as polar lipids of see bream inhibited Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT in a non-dose-dependent manner.  In conclusion, these data demonstrate that dithiothreitol (DTT)-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase (Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT) activity is present in human mesangial cells and the biochemical properties and kinetic parameters of this enzyme of human mesangial cell (HMC) were established for the first time. Concerning previous data, Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT of mesangial cells seems to have similar properties with Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT characterized in several cells and tissues including human kidney. Platelet activating factor (PAF) production in kidney, mainly by mesangial cells, is involved in the pathogenesis of renal damage.",89d0ea41-089e-4e45-aa86-0673bb8d7b92
25,discussion8," The characterization of Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity in human mesangial cells enables further investigation of Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT regulatory mechanisms, and therefore its contribution in Platelet activating factor (PAF) production under physiological and pathological conditions. Several drugs and bioactive compounds of Mediterranean diet with beneficial effects in various pathological conditions  [26, 27, 31–41] seem to exhibit an inhibitory effect on Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity that maybe correlate with their general biological action. It is possible that the inhibition of Platelet activating factor (PAF)-CPT activity in several pathological manifestations (mainly systemic) can restore pathologically long-term slightly increased basal Platelet activating factor (PAF) levels to their physiological ones, and therefore might reverse these pathological conditions. This new point of view need to be further studied.",0740ca1b-ac14-4bda-bd6a-6e211ed102e4
