0,methods0,"4.1. Reagents and Chemicals The synthetic hydroxytyrosol (HyT), ≥98% in purity, was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). HyT was dissolved in ethanol (EtOH) and added to the medium, while EtOH vehicle alone was also used as a control. Two different lots of A009 (L3 and L4) were used. When not specified, experiments showing only one A009 extract were performed using the L4 lot.  4.2. Preparation of A009 and Phenolic Quantification of a waste material termed ‘olive mill wastewater’ (OMWW)s were kindly provided by Agriturismo La Vialla (Castiglion Fibocchi, Arezzo, Italy) and used to obtain the phenol-rich purified extract A009 (Patents No. 1420804; No. 1420805). The experiments were performed using two different batches of A009 (batch L3 and L4, Table S1). A009 was obtained from of a waste material termed ‘olive mill wastewater’ (OMWW) using two sequential cross-flow filtration processes, as previously described [18].",9724e152-03aa-494c-bb03-24a479ff61fe
1,methods1," Briefly, microfiltration (MF) was performed on a pilot plant equipped with tubular ceramic module membranes in alumina oxide with a MWCO of 0.45 microns. The MF permeate was further concentrated by reverse osmosis (RO) in a polyamide spiral wound module (Microdyn Nadir, Wiesbaden, Germany) with a filtering surface of 7 m2. The RO permeate, representing ultrapure water, was discarded. Finally, the RO concentrate, with a volume concentration ratio (volume concentration ratio (VCR)) of 3.6, constituted the A009. Phenolic composition of A009 was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)) analysis. Quantification revealed that the major phenolic component of A009 is HyT, along with several other phenolic compounds (Table S1).  4.3. Cell Cultures All experiments were performed using three cell lines of prostate cancer, human metastatic hormone-sensitive LNCaP and hormone-resistant cells PC-3, and DU-145.",919b7bf8-52ee-4627-8f8a-9da43219fd00
