All participants and their parents received a detailed explanation of the study’s purposes. Thus, we obtained a verbal consent from all the enrolled adolescents, after they were informed that participation was voluntary. Parents of adolescents were provided written informed consent prior to the adolescents’ enrolment in the trial. This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethic Committee of the University of Calabria, Italy (#5727/2018).  2.",b51be220-5c97-4a7a-a167-2ab213ea8c50
1,methods1,"1. Study Population A total of 92 subjects, including 44 girls and 48 boys, aged 14 to 17 years, were recruited from students of the public high school “Istituto Istruzione Superiore”-Castrolibero (CS) and several swim, soccer, and squash teams located in Calabria Region, Italy, during the period from December 2018 to January 2019. The exclusion criteria included lack of completing the questionnaire of adherence to a MD, evident health-related problems, use of medications, any kind of restrictive diet (i.e., hypocaloric, low carbohydrate, and low fat). Participants did not have any kind of cognitive or physical/motor limitation.  2.2. Nutritional History Assessment The nutritional and medical history of participants were investigated during an oral interview by a team of professionals in nutrition, using a nutritional history record, as previously reported [31,32].",b56e92ea-fb07-44d6-9b97-af4fcd3c4659
2,methods2," Our interview included the following sections: general data (date of birth and sex); medical history (illness, taking medications, vitamins, minerals or other dietary supplements, presence of allergy and food allergy, and food intolerance); nutritional habits to assess usual food intake and eating patterns; physical activity habits (Supplementary Table S1). On the basis of the WHO recommendations [33], the intensity of physical activity (PA) levels were classified as follows: physical inactivity (<3 metabolic equivalents (METs), moderate PA (3 to 6 METs), and vigorous-intensity PA (>6 METs).",03c3ba0b-9c7a-4adb-b3b0-85a7ee64a063
3,methods3," On the basis of at least 60 min daily of moderate-intensity PA, such as bicycling, dancing, brisk walking, gymnastics, ballet, aquatic aerobics, recreational swimming or vigorous-intensity PA such as jogging or running, boxing, tennis, soccer, basketball, squash, swimming, aerobic dancing, and volleyball the enrolled population was divided into the following three groups: Group A (physical inactivity, 25 subjects), Group B (moderate-intensity PA, 35 subjects) and Group C (vigorous-intensity PA, 32 subjects).  2.3. Questionnaire of Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (KIDMED Test) The KIDMED test, used to assess the adherence to the MD in the study population [9], was updated according to the new MD pyramid by the International Foundation of Mediterranean Diet (IFMed) [34]. The MD adherence score, from 0 to 12, was based on a 16-point test that was administered through a paper questionnaire (Supplementary Table S2).",f850320d-d261-4446-aa85-ac987bad164d
4,methods4," Questions denoting a positive aspect with respect to the MD were assigned a value of +1 (consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, whole cereals or grain, nuts, oil, dairy products, and yogurt) and those with a negative connotation −1 (skipping breakfast, consumption of baked goods, sweets, and going to a fast food). The sum of the values from the questions was classified into the following three levels of MD adherence: optimal (≥8 points), medium (4 to 7 points), and poor (≤3 points) [9].  2.4. Anthropometric Parameters The basic anthropometric data were collected using validated protocol by the anthropometric evaluation manual of nutritional status [35]. Participants’ weight was determined using KERN MPC 250K100M with a capacity of 250 kg and a precision of 100 g. Height was determined using a Seca stadiometer (Model 206, Seca Deutschland, Hamburg, Germany), which has a maximum capacity of 220 cm and precision of 1 mm.",d49ffa37-9391-45bd-9aa6-9bb740bdb0b3
5,methods5," Weight and height were measured with subjects wearing light clothing and no shoes. Body circumferences (waist and hip) of each participant were measured by Seca 201 validated ergonomic circumferences measuring tape, with a measurement range of 1 to 205 cm and a division of 1 mm. Weight and height were used to calculate the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), i.e., weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.  2.5. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis Body composition evaluation was performed after a 12 h overnight of fasting. Each subject underwent a bio-impedentiometric analysis (bio impedentiometric analysis (BIA)) (single-frequency 50 kHz bio impedentiometric analysis (BIA) 101 S, Akern/RJL Systems, Florence, Italy) which was carried out to evaluate resistance, reactance, phase angle (PhA), total body water (total body water (TBW)), body cell mass (body cell mass (BCM)), free fat mass (free fat mass (FFM)), and fat mass (FM).",ef5f5cb8-6d7e-49db-9935-1ada46917958

Shoes and socks were removed, and contact areas were scrubbed with alcohol immediately before electrode placement. Electrodes (bio impedentiometric analysis (BIA)TRODES Akern Srl Florence, Italy) were placed proximal to the phalangeal metacarpal joint on the dorsal surface of the right hand and distal to the transverse arch on the superior surface of the right foot. Sensor electrodes were placed at the midpoint between the distal prominence of the radius and ulna of the right wrist, and between the medial and lateral malleoli of the right ankle according to measurement procedure protocol [36]. Data were analyzed by Bodygram Plus (software) Version 1.2.2.8. (Akern Srl; Florence, Italy).  2.6. Biochemical Measurements Venous blood samples were collected after 8 to 10 h overnight fasting conditions.",ab576510-3ab4-4d08-93b9-35ccf63af841
7,methods7," Serum was obtained after centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min and stored in sterile tubes at 4 °C for no longer than 4 h during the morning of collection. Biochemical parameters were determined on a Konelab 20i Chemistry Analyzer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Vantaa, Finland) according to the standardized procedures. Afterward, the serum samples were stored at −80 °C.  2.7. Hormonal Level Assessments Serum insulin levels were measured with an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)) kit (Novatec Immundiagnostica GmbH, Dietzenbach, Germany) following the manufacturer instructions. The lowest detectable concentration of insulin was 0.25 µIU/mL at a 95% confidence limit, the intra-assay variability was within ≤5%. Insulin action was expressed as HomeOstasis Model Assessment for estimating Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) which was calculated as the product of fasting glucose concentration (mg/dL) and fasting insulin concentration divided by 405.",43d7aaf3-c16f-4a63-98c8-685161f01616

The kit has a detection sensitivity limit of 6.25 ng/mL irisin.  2.8. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot Version 12.0 (Systat, San Jose, CA, USA). A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (with Lilliefors’ correction) was used to verify data normality. Data were reported as the mean and standard deviation (SD). The data that was not normally distributed were log10-transformed before evaluating statistical differences between samples by using parametric tests (one-way ANOVA and Student’s t-test). Linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between independent and dependent variables. The regression coefficient was used to graph the straight line that most closely described the association between variables, and the statistical significance was evaluated by Pearson’s correlation test.",128bb677-6531-4d26-8571-03d5449b5eda
9,methods9," Qualitative variables were described as frequencies (%) with respect to an ideal situation (100% compliance) and the statistical differences were evaluated by Chi-squared tests and summarized in graph (radar plot) and tables. The overall accuracy of each predictor of physical activity (irisin, LDL, HDL, body mass index (BMI), free fat mass (FFM) (%), body cell mass (BCM) (kg), PhA and total body water (TBW)) was determined by a receiver operating characteristic (receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC)) curve analysis by using MedCalc for Windows, v 8.1 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium).

Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.  3. Results Anthropometric characteristics, KIDMED score, and physical activity levels of participants enrolled within the Italian project Di, Me, Nu are presented in Table 1. The mean age of the total population studied was 15.76 (±0.99) years without gender differences. The MD adherence evaluated by the KIDMED score was 5.86 (±2.41) for the total adolescent sample independent of sex, indicating a medium adherence to the MD (Table 1).",938116f8-a20c-41ae-aa75-eb3b9a91d586
11,methods11,"  On the basis of the KIDMED test, the compliance rates for each food were calculated and depicted in radar charts, which illustrate the gap between the current state (percentage of participants currently adhering to each dietary recommendation) and the ideal situation (100% compliance) in the total population sample, as well as in girls and boys (Figure 1). Importantly, in the entire population, the intake of a second fruit (27%), nuts (30%), more vegetables (38%), and yogurts or cheese (40%) resulted definitively outside the recommendations, furthermore, those who consumed baked goods or pastries for breakfast (59%) were also located outside current nutritional guidelines (Figure 1). A comparison of girls and boys showed significant differences for the intakes of fish (48% vs. 81%, p < 0.001) and nuts (20% vs. 40%, p < 0.05) and for the habit of having breakfast (68% vs. 85%, p < 0.05), respectively (Figure 1).",4ccaaf16-d3ce-4a4c-9d6c-2d90f7cb23bd
12,methods12,"  In Table 1, based on the different levels of the intensity of physical activities or exercise established by the WHO [33], we classified the whole sample into the following three groups: Group A of physical inactivity in which adolescents did not achieve physical activity guidelines [11], Groups B and C categorized according to their moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA, respectively. According to this categorization, body composition parameters were evaluated in all subjects enrolled and in relation to gender, which were analyzed separately (Table 2). Specifically, significant differences were observed in the total sample for all the variables (body mass index (BMI), PhA, body cell mass (BCM), free fat mass (FFM), FM, and total body water (TBW)) as comparing with Group A vs. Group C.",7c8cb17e-d3f7-4ef9-b814-cb4108000bde
13,methods14,"45 ± 3.46 vs. 32.18 ± 5.32 and 29.91 ± 4.21, p < 0.05, respectively), while total body water (TBW) resulted higher in Group C vs. Groups A and B (60.1 ± 4.73 vs. 53.61 ± 7.06 and 54.34 ± 4.66, p < 0.05, respectively). In boys, statistically significant differences for all the variables analyzed were found (Table 2).  Analyzing population sample into the three intensity levels of PA, no differences in the KIDMED score were found (Figure 2). However, in the three groups, the differences in the compliance rates for each food were also calculated and depicted in radar charts, as shown in Figure 2. Although among the three groups of PA levels there were no significant differences in the food rates for most of the dietary recommendations, adolescents of Group C showed the intake of nuts higher than those of Groups B and A (47% vs. 23% and 20%, p < 0.05), as well as the percentage of subjects having breakfast was higher in Group C as compared with Groups B and A (94% vs. 71% and 64%, p < 0.",7f05a2f8-d025-4fe4-932f-3ac2d20445c7
14,methods15,"05), even the intakes of whole cereals, bread, and rusks for breakfast were 34% vs. 51% and 84% in Group C vs. Groups B and A, respectively (p < 0.05) (Figure 2).  Table 3 shows the metabolic profile results for all subjects and in relation to gender according to different levels of PA intensity. We found, in the total sample, a significant increase in serum glucose levels as comparing with Group C vs. Group A (85.85 ± 6.37 vs. 81.72 ± 7.05, p < 0.05) and for the presence of reduced serum insulin levels between Groups C and B vs. Group A (9.74 ± 3.78 and 9.13 ± 4.20 vs. 12.61 ± 5.97, p < 0.05). To be noted, in adolescents from Group A, HOMA-IR values were significantly higher as compared with those from Group B (2.56 ± 1.22 vs. 1.84 ± 0.85, p < 0.05) and a similar reduced trend was found in Group C. When analyzing differences in these metabolic parameters for gender, we observed a significant reduction in insulin levels in boys of Group C vs. Group A (9.54 ± 4.14 vs. 13.93 ± 7.",75b16d90-60cf-41a9-93ea-c77bc3501105
15,methods17,"54 ± 7.00, p < 0.01), whereas in girls, higher levels were observed in Group C vs. Group A (30.00 ± 4.50 vs. 24.30 ± 5.51, p < 0.05). More interestingly, total adolescents from Group C, as well as girls, had significantly higher irisin levels than those from Group A (55.02 ± 81.19 vs. 12.3 ± 8.88, p < 0.05, total sample; 27.05 ± 16.14 vs. 12.93 ± 8.92, p < 0.05, girls) (Table 3).  Interestingly, assessing the correlation of irisin with metabolic parameters, we found a negative association between irisin and both total cholesterol (r = −0.428 and p = 0.04) and LDL (r = −0.468 and p = 0.02) in Group C (Figure 4).  Finally, we analyzed the usefulness of anthropometric indices, body composition parameters, lipid profiles, and irisin as predictors of vigorous-intensity PA with respect to inactivity in adolescents (Group C vs. Group A).

Particularly, free fat mass (FFM) and total body water (TBW) had the highest sensitivity (>90%), while irisin, BMC, and PhA showed the highest specificity (>80%).  The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) curves for the most predictive measures are shown in Figure 5.  4. Discussion The present study aimed to analyze and describe the impact of PA and adherence to a MD on body composition, as well as on health-related metabolic and hormonal parameters in Italian adolescents.",ab74d7e5-985f-406d-9c06-fee3a398abae
17,methods19," The main findings are that adolescents performing vigorous-intensity PA have the following characteristics: (1) better distribution of compliance with food-related recommendation of MD, (2) body composition parameters reflecting lean metabolic active body mass, (3) reduced insulin concentrations and insulin resistance, (4) lower lipid profile markers, and (5) elevated serum irisin levels.  It is widely accepted that adherence to the MD pattern has been shown to be associated with a better health status, due to its protective effects against a wide range of chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and several cancers [5,6,37,38,39]. Recently, higher MD adherence was found to be positively correlated to well-being in a young population [40].",57bda97d-28aa-429a-8b96-5cd304f4febc
18,methods20," Thus, it is worth highlighting the importance of promoting the MD model, particularly during adolescence as a tool to achieve an overall healthy condition that improves life expectancy. In this cross-sectional study, the results of the KIDMED test (poor 16.3%, medium 60.87%, and optimal adherence 22.83%) were similar to those of studies carried out in other countries in which a medium adherence to the MD was reported [41,42,43,44,45]. Furthermore, no significant differences were found in adherence to the MD according to gender, in agreement with the data reported by other authors among adolescents living in the Mediterranean region [42]. We have also recently found an average adherence to the MD in the adult population from the same Mediterranean area, which was independent of sex, but directly associated with age [46].",493400d1-6ca4-4fb7-a74a-fd0ac33b6d6c
19,methods21," Importantly, in all samples, the percentage of adherers to recommendations for fruits, nuts, and fish, estimated by a validated 14-point Mediterranean adherence screener (Mediterranean adherence screener (MEDAS)) result was outside the dietary guidelines [46]. Referring to the evaluation using the KIDMED to assess the adherence to the MD in our adolescent sample, the compliance rates for consuming yogurts or cheese every day, more vegetables a day, nuts every day, and a second fruit each day resulted in being definitively outside the recommendations. When analyzing the results of dietary habits by gender, surprisingly boys were more compliant in fish and nuts intake and had less tendency to skip breakfast.",d969df25-4dc3-438d-86f0-164fc069e40a
20,methods22," However, this research underlines the need to reinforce the adherence to the MD in adolescents, since emerging experimental evidences have been recurrently established that a MD, rich in fiber, minerals, vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, and monounsaturated fatty acids, provides an equilibrated mix of nutrients with beneficial effects due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, probiotic and antineoplastic functions [47].  More importantly, in association with adherence to a MD, PA is a crucial indicator of healthy lifestyles, since it is considered to be a cornerstone in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and age-related muscle wasting [48,49]. The benefits of PA or better exercise or sport are related to an adequate body composition that, in turn, can assure a good physical fitness and/or high rate of adherence to a MD along with high levels of a health-related quality of life [50,51].",eb3ff3d0-f81b-48c4-875e-aa9e78f9a153
21,methods23," Interestingly, when categorizing our population sample of adolescents according to physical inactivity or different intensity levels of PA, we found in Group C a better compliance in nuts intake and a lower tendency to skip breakfast. It is worthwhile to highlight that, although the MD adherence was similar among adolescents studied, subjects performing vigorous-intensity activity showed an overall healthier diet. In addition, profound differences in anthropometric measurements and body composition parameters assessed by the bio impedentiometric analysis (BIA) method among groups were observed. Particularly, the comparison between inactive subjects and those engaged in regular vigorous PA displayed reduced body mass index (BMI) values concomitant with decreased FM, while body cell mass (BCM) indices and the percentages of total body water (TBW) were significantly increased.",12d018f3-c804-419b-a21c-6eac8023b642
22,methods24," Of note, the PhA values, that reflect body cell mass, the integrity of the cell wall, cellular health, and, consequently, the health of the individual [52] were higher in adolescents grouped according to their vigorous-intensity PA as compared with inactive subjects. Our results are in line with data from a recent meta-analysis showing that PA had a positive effect on PhA that were significantly higher in the active group than in the control group, suggesting the importance of routinely including exercise in health care [53]. When analyzing the data by gender, significant differences were observed for anthropometric and all body composition variables tested between boys of Group C as compared with Group A, while in girls significant differences were observed for body mass index (BMI), body cell mass (BCM) expressed in kilograms, and total body water (TBW), likely due to the diverse adaptation, also mediated by hormonal status, to the same level of PA.",4e8d4331-3987-4336-ace0-7516c933b758
23,methods25,"  Beneficial effects of PA are mediated by metabolic and molecular remodeling of skeletal muscle able to modulate glycemic and lipid profiles [21]. Indeed, adolescents performing vigorous-intensity PA had increased levels in fasting glycemia, along with a significant reduction in insulin levels as compared with their inactive counterparts, that conversely had higher values of HOMA-IR, reflecting a higher insulin resistance in all samples and in boys. These results endorse that physical exercise activates the insulin-signaling pathways and facilitates the process of glucose diffusion via GLUT-4 [54]. Thus, sensitivity to insulin action is increased and lower levels of insulin release are required for glucose uptake. Furthermore, insulin was also inversely correlated to free fat mass (FFM) in adolescents of Group C, clearly underlining the impact of this hormonal parameter on body composition in relation to the level of PA.",5fa21a09-e6f5-4825-a69f-b65eac0015b4
24,methods26," Controversial data has been reported regarding the association between PA and lipid profile in a young population [55,56,57,58]. In agreement with previous studies [59,60], we found a lipid profile marker which consisted of lower LDL levels and higher HDL concentrations in Group C as compared with Group A, whereas TG levels were unmodified among groups.  The favorable effects of PA could be, at least in part, achieved by so-called exercise mimetics, including cytokines released from muscle and termed myokines, which communicate with other tissues and act locally on muscle to exert metabolic effects in an autocrine/paracrine/endocrine manner [22]. Among myokines, irisin has been suggested to mediate some of the beneficial effects of PA by inducing uncoupling protein 1 and, subsequently, increasing energy expenditure in white adipocytes [23]. However, currently, there is growing interest in exploring the impact of different levels of PA intensities in circulating serum irisin.",cf893e1d-d88e-49ce-b1c7-6821d7279dd9
25,methods27," In our study, according to the PA intensity levels, we observed a trend toward a progressive increase in irisin concentration, which showed the highest levels in adolescents engaged in regularly vigorous PA. More importantly, in the same subjects, a negative association between irisin and both total cholesterol and LDL levels was observed, suggesting irisin as a potential favorable link between PA and lipid metabolism. Analyzing the usefulness of irisin, as well as the lipid profile, as predictors of vigorous-intensity PA in adolescents using area under the ROC curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) curves, we observed an appreciable accuracy of these predictors. Similarly, results obtained from receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis for free fat mass (FFM), body cell mass (BCM), PhA, and total body water (TBW) suggest that these selective body composition variables are predictable markers of PA.",f8fd8aed-93c4-44a7-aad3-93d51fc8f32b
26,methods28,"  There are a number of potential limitations of the study that need to be taken into account when interpreting the results. First, this is an observational and cross-sectional investigation, limiting the ability to make causal inferences about the association between irisin and body composition, as well as lipid profile in relation to PA. Another limitation of the study was the relatively small sample size, particularly for some PA groups (e.g., girls of Group C) that could potentially impact on the statistically differences of the results when evaluated by gender, and a suspected confounding effect of hormonal changes occurring during puberty. However, results from the present study document profound differences in anthropometric, body composition, biochemical, and hormonal parameters, as well as in food-related recommendation of MD in adolescents categorized into different intensity PA level groups.",25ed2a7f-a1cb-468c-a0b7-7566194dc026
27,methods29," Future studies with more potential factors, larger number of participants, and using objective methods to measure physical activity are needed to confirm our results.  5. Conclusions In summary, we found that serum irisin levels were higher in active than in inactive adolescents and negatively correlated with unhealthy metabolic parameters in subjects performing vigorous-intensity PA. Our findings highlight the importance of developing prevention programs that include improving the intensity of PA, and, in addition, adherence to a MD among adolescents, given that this combination is a superior strategy for ensuring a better quality of life.
