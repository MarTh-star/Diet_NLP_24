0,background0, Colorectal cancer in adults 50 years old and younger is increasing in incidence worldwide. Diet may be a modifiable risk factor. The objective of this study was to examine evidence regarding the association between diet and the risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer (EOColorectal cancer (CRC)) and early-onset colorectal adenomas in young adults. ,a28c8f0f-99b0-4fa8-a228-521ab7a0d1b8
1,methods0," Search Strategy  The methodology follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Databases searched include PubMed and Web of Science. The databases were searched using the following key words: risk, early-onset colorectal cancer, diet, young-onset colorectal cancer, risk factors. “And” and “or” were used to combine the keywords listed and to minimize search duplications. There were no language restrictions on the searches. A backwards search was also conducted, i.e., references of accessed studies were evaluated for relevant studies that may have been missed through the database search. A gray literature search of Google was performed. Finally, the Embase database was searched for any articles missed from the above searches. No new articles were found in Embase.

Relationship Between Dietary Patterns and Early Onset Colorectal Cancer Risk  Four studies explored how different dietary patterns were associated with EOColorectal cancer (CRC) risk (26–29). In a case control study, consumption of deep fried foods > 5x/week was associated with an elevated risk for rectal cancer and tumors on the right side of the colon (OR = 4.3, CI = 1.5–12.1, p = 0.01; OR = 3.9, CI = 1.4–10.7, p = 0.008, respectively) (29). Consumption of refined foods including corn flakes, pastas, noodles, pizza and refined sugars, appeared protective against EOColorectal cancer (CRC) as reported in the Khan et al. case-control study (OR = 0.",cb625bcb-2edd-43cf-a560-62c30f2e8924
30,results18,"01, CI = 0.00–0.04) (28). Greater consumption of sugary drinks (7+ drinks/week) and desserts (3–6x/week) was associated with an elevated risk of EOColorectal cancer (CRC) (OR = 2.99, CI = 1.57–5.68, p = 0.002; OR = 2.28, CI = 1.28–4.04) (27). Consumption of fast food two or more times/week showed a suggestive, but not significant, association with increased risk of EOColorectal cancer (CRC) compared to consumption <1x/week (OR = 1.84, CI = 0.98–3.46, p = 0.07) (27). Two studies categorized diets according to their adherence to a plant-based diet. Khan et al. found a vegetarian diet contributed a protective affect against EOColorectal cancer (CRC) (OR = 0.06, CI = 0.02–0.22) (28); however, a plant-based diet was not associated with Colorectal cancer (CRC) (HR = 1.24, CI = 0.72–2.16, p = 0.54) in a study with only female participants (24). Two studies observed a protective effect against EOColorectal cancer (CRC) for increased citrus fruit and vegetable consumption (p = 0.",55614463-fa79-423c-9a98-660147975f1b
31,results19,"006) (29) (Vegetables: OR = 0.40, CI = 0.28–0.56, p < 0.001, Citrus Fruits: OR = 0.61, CI = 0.45–0.84, p = 0.002) (26). A greater consumption of red meat was associated with an increased risk of EOColorectal cancer (CRC) in a study with only female participants (OR = 1.10, CI = 1.04–1.16, p < 0.001) (25); however, three studies that included male participants showed no association (26, 27, 29).  Relationship Between Diet Quality and Early Onset Colorectal Cancer Risk  Two studies examined the relationship between diet quality and EOColorectal cancer (CRC) risk (27, 28) and showed that the overall quality of the diet was inversely associated with the risk of developing Colorectal cancer (CRC) at a young age. Categorizing and scoring diets according to their similarities to a Western diet showed an elevated risk of developing EOColorectal cancer (CRC) for those with the higher Western diet score compared to lower (OR = 1.92, CI = 1.01–3.66, p = 0.047) (27).",0c932810-9211-4f88-95dd-a8d2ea3bae84
32,results20," Additionally, a high fat diet was significantly associated with a higher chance of developing EOColorectal cancer (CRC) compared to those who did not consume this diet (OR = 1.98, CI = 1.13–3.49, p = 0.017) (28). ",0231d1c7-7c9a-4c91-9dd6-89ab00920601
33,discussion0," Currently, there is extensive evidence pointing to an association between certain dietary factors and risk for developing older-onset colorectal cancer. However, there is much less known about the modifiable risk factors for developing early-onset colorectal cancer. As such, it has been difficult to identify groups of people at risk for EOColorectal cancer (CRC) based on modifiable risk factors, such as dietary patterns, and flag them for early screening or other preventative actions. Unlike other published systematic reviews, this systematic review focused solely on diet as a risk factor for developing or preventing early-onset colorectal cancer and colorectal adenomas.  Approximately 85% of early-onset colorectal cancer cases develop through the conventional adenoma-carcinoma sequence (20). Therefore, it was important to investigate dietary risk factors for both potentially precancerous early-onset colorectal adenomas and EOColorectal cancer (CRC).",b169c87c-0dc8-45a8-9841-6996e81f6fe6
34,discussion1," One of the four studies that analyzed risk factors for colorectal adenomas focused on sugar sweetened beverage (sugar sweetened beverage (SSB)) consumption both during high school and adult life (20). It was shown that a high sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) and fructose consumption during high school significantly increased the risk of developing colorectal adenomas before the age of 50. Additionally, women who consumed less fruit during adolescence were shown to have stronger associations for adenoma risk than those who consumed more. Fruits and liquid fructose have different intestinal release rates due to the fiber content and other cellular components of whole fruits (20). Liquid fructose is rapidly digested, and large amounts of fructose at one time can exceed small intestine uptake capacity and overflow to the colon (20). In addition to the study looking at adenomas, one study found similar results for sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and EOColorectal cancer (CRC) risk.",725485b5-9e85-446f-9031-dbbd4876b350
35,discussion2," A higher consumption of sugar sweetened beverages was significantly associated with an increased risk of EOColorectal cancer (CRC) (27). It is believed an overall unhealthy diet combined with excessive sugar intake may exacerbate chronic insulin release, thereby promoting colorectal carcinogenesis. High fructose corn syrup, the main sweetener in beverages since the 1980s, has negative impacts on insulin sensitivity and the gut microbiota, which may play a role in EOColorectal cancer (CRC) etiology (27).  One study investigated how a diet which promotes sulfur-metabolizing bacteria influences early-onset adenoma risk. It was found that a high sulfur microbial diet score significantly increased the risk of developing a colorectal adenoma before age 50 (21). A higher score indicated that a participant consumed more foods associated with the enrichment of sulfur-metabolizing microbes in the gut, which may lead to a higher production of pro-carcinogenic hydrogen sulfide (21).",3bb8add3-6968-49fa-88f4-78966333485c
36,discussion3," Processed meats were included in the category of foods positively associated with the enrichment of sulfur-metabolizing bacteria. Plant-based sulfur sources are distinct from animal-based sources because they are composed of primarily cancer protective compounds, such as glucosinolate, and are negatively associated with the enrichment of the bacteria (21).  Red meat and processed meat are well documented risk factors for colorectal cancer (23) due to their genotoxic effects (30). Despite this, red meat consumption was not shown to be a risk factor for early-onset colorectal adenomas and results were mixed for EOColorectal cancer (CRC). It was speculated that the lack of significance may have been due to the fact that individuals under 50 years old have experienced a shorter duration of meat exposure, which may not be long enough to produce a significant effect (23).",e4be7317-3d28-4cad-8df7-f192ee1a6b0e
37,discussion4," Three large cohort studies agree that red meat consumption may not impact adenoma development until later in life (23, 31, 32). It has not yet been confirmed at what stage of carcinogenesis red meat plays its largest role. However, processed, barbequed and cured meats did increase the risk of EOColorectal cancer (CRC) (27, 29). This is consistent with the hypothesis that N-nitroso compound formation increases Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (29), and that N-nitroso compounds are highly genotoxic (33). Existing evidence is in line with the findings that processed meat is directly associated to EOColorectal cancer (CRC) risk (26, 34).  It has been well established in Westernized countries but also globally over the past several decades that dietary patterns in younger generations are shifting toward more unhealthy diets, such as a Western diet (25).",2f4de972-0d1a-46c1-b042-b374890a2768
38,discussion5," Diets are becoming increasingly heavy in meat, fats, oils, added sugars and sweeteners while vegetables, fruits and whole grain consumption is decreasing (22, 25). The Western diet is characterized by low-fiber, high fat and high sugar, and is known to be more pro-inflammatory than it is anti-inflammatory (27). In the studies reviewed, a high Western diet score was associated with an increased risk of adenoma development, specifically those in the distal colon and rectum (22). A recent cohort study found that a Western diet induces both inflammation and gut dysbiosis, potentially explaining its role in increasing early onset colorectal adenoma risk (27). Consistent with the studies on adenoma risk, a Western-like diet was related to an increased risk of EOColorectal cancer (CRC) (27). A Western diet is more strongly associated with tumors of molecular subtypes common in EOColorectal cancer (CRC) (22).",09698be7-ab8a-4914-8d52-57e35af36fca
39,discussion6," These molecular subtypes are more likely to originate through the conventional adenoma-carcinoma sequence (21), therefore it is not surprising that a Western diet was consistent with an increased risk of both EOColorectal cancer (CRC) and adenomas. Western diets have also been shown to be associated with traditional Colorectal cancer (CRC) (22). The results of a Western diet on EOColorectal cancer (CRC) risk suggest overall poor diet quality may also be a risk factor for early-onset Colorectal cancer (CRC) (27), which is currently considered a putative risk factor for traditional Colorectal cancer (CRC).  In line with the findings that poor diet quality is a risk factor for EOColorectal cancer (CRC) are studies reporting that a high-fat diet was associated with an increased risk for EOColorectal cancer (CRC) (28), and common among those who developed adenomas before age 50 (23).",0a190211-a967-460b-b8fa-2e93cbabdf7f
40,discussion7," This is consistent with data that found an increased risk of EOColorectal cancer (CRC) to be associated with a high intake of processed foods, as these foods are often high in fat (29). Unhealthy diets, characterized by high fat and processed food consumption, are linked to obesity which has been shown to be associated with the risk of EOColorectal cancer (CRC) in previous studies (22, 35). However, direct evidence for the effect of consuming a high-fat diet on EOColorectal cancer (CRC) risk is needed.  Healthy diets, as indicated by recommendation based dietary indices, have been shown to be associated with a lower risk of traditional Colorectal cancer (CRC) (24). Adherence to the Prudent diet, alternative Mediterranean diet, AHEI-2010 and Diet (DASH) diet, were shown to have an inverse association with early onset colorectal adenoma risk in both the distal colon and rectum. The Diet (DASH) diet is characterized by being high in low fat dairy, which is a good source of calcium.",a7834ad4-8501-4555-87dc-2ef8bce53a4f
41,discussion8," High calcium intake has been shown to be inversely related with distal colon cancer, potentially because of its capability to reduce cell proliferation and promote cell differentiation and apoptosis (22). This is in agreement with the two studies included in this review which found low calcium intakes increased EOColorectal cancer (CRC) risk (25). The protective effect of calcium is consistent with evidence for traditional Colorectal cancer (CRC), signifying calcium may have implications for chemoprevention research (27).  It is important to note alcohol consumption was considered when scoring both the sulfur microbial diet and the alternative Mediterranean diet (21, 22). This review excluded most data related to alcohol consumption; however, the intake of these beverages was not able to be separated out of the published results.",bec016cb-9e82-4b0a-a31c-c4ecb5a86b23
42,discussion9," It cannot be ruled out that the significance seen in these studies' results may have been influenced by the alcoholic beverage consumption, a known risk factor for Colorectal cancer (CRC) (36). The sulfur microbial diet score was influenced by liquor and beer intake. Liquor was considered one of the food groups positively associated with the enrichment of sulfur-metabolizing bacteria. Beer was included in the group of foods negatively associated with the enrichment of sulfur-metabolizing bacteria. A higher sulfur microbial diet score indicates one's diet is more enriched for sulfur-metabolizing bacteria, which could enhance the production of pro-carcinogenic compounds (21). Therefore, liquor was considered to be more harmful when it comes to enhancing the risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenomas, and beer may be more protective. Zheng et al. measured alcohol consumption when scoring diets according to the Alternative Mediterranean diet (AMED) score (22).",1fd14798-aac4-4de7-9165-ebef845d855c
43,discussion10," A traditional Mediterranean diet includes moderate consumption of ethanol, typically in the form of wine (37). Resveratrol, found in the skin and seeds of grapes, is one of multiple polyphenolic compounds found in wine. Polyphenolic content is higher in red wines but varies by the grape varietal and the vinification process (38). Resveratrol's proposed cancer protecting properties include defending against reactive oxidative species induced damage and repressing platelet aggregation (39). Resveratrol in combination with other polyphenolic compounds is believed to be useful in advanced stages of cancer through its ability to deregulate many pathways affecting cancer cell growth and oncogenic signaling (40). Additionally, resveratrol has been shown to have beneficial effects for tumor prevention (41, 42). A greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet has been linked to lower levels of cancer mortality (43).",56494805-3dbe-47d2-b075-629776be6d45
44,discussion11," Previously published studies have demonstrated mixed results when it comes to alcohol consumption and traditional Colorectal cancer (CRC). A retrospective analysis performed by Crockett et al. found that moderate intake of wine was inversely associated with Colorectal cancer (CRC) (44). However, multiple meta-analyses have found that alcohol increases Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in a linear dose-related manner (45–47). According to the study included in this review, a higher Alternative Mediterranean diet (AMED) score was associated with a lower risk of early-onset colorectal adenomas, although the amount of alcohol consumed by participants was not listed (22).  Other micronutrients shown to lower the risk for EOColorectal cancer (CRC) include beta-carotene, vitamin, C, vitamin E and folate (26). A second study found that low folate and fiber intake increased the risk for developing EOColorectal cancer (CRC) (25).",15c6124d-6235-4f1b-87d8-d788d0ba5e76
45,discussion12," It was unsurprising high intakes of citrus fruits and vegetables also appeared protective against EOColorectal cancer (CRC) because they are high in fiber and micronutrients, like the ones described previously (26, 29). The positive association between fruit and vegetable intake and EOColorectal cancer (CRC) risk is in line with existing evidence (26). The anti-inflammatory compounds found in various fruits and vegetables may help modulate cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis (28). One study found the consumption of fresh fruit and raw vegetables to be protective in the colon, but not the rectum, which is in agreement with previous case-control studies (29, 48). Despite the positive results from fruit and vegetable consumption, vegetarian diets produced mixed results. One study found a vegetarian diet to be protective, whereas another saw no effect (24, 28).",4c0d8abc-3168-4e58-ae8f-10864c587452
46,discussion13," It is possible that the plant-based diet indices used to measure vegetarian diets in one study is tailored more toward critical factors for heart disease, and therefore may be less important for cancer (24).  Many of the studies examined colorectal cancer and adenoma by subsite. The subdivisions of the colorectal area have different blood supplies, patterns of motility and physiological function (29). It has been hypothesized that the specific mechanisms of carcinogenesis parallel the physiological differences (29). This may explain why different areas of the colorectal region were affected by different dietary habits. Because EOColorectal cancer (CRC) typically occurs in the distal colon and rectum, it may be more important to focus on the dietary habits which exhibit risk factors for cancers occurring in these regions. From the studies investigated in this review, the Western diet was associated with an increase in colorectal adenoma risk in the distal and rectal regions (22).",2532f45d-2d87-4082-80c8-48b873aaba7a
47,discussion14," The Prudent, Diet (DASH) and AHEI-2010 diets were protective against adenoma risk in distal and rectal region (22). Low folate, fiber and calcium intakes were related to a higher risk of early-onset rectal cancer, as well as high levels of fast food consumption (25, 29).  Listed in Table 4 are the covariates adjusted for in the included studies. Half of the studies in this review included body mass index (BMI) as a covariate adjustment. body mass index (BMI) was considered a potential confounder due to the link between obesity and traditional Colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as data suggesting obesity is significantly associated with increased EOColorectal cancer (CRC) risk (10, 49). The five studies which did not adjust for obesity cannot rule out the possibility that participants body mass index (BMI) may have impacted their findings.",0193aa3c-4617-4bb2-a934-1c6829486133
48,discussion15," It has been hypothesized that obesity is linked to EOColorectal cancer (CRC) cases because the increasing prevalence of obesity parallels the increasing incidence of EOColorectal cancer (CRC) (49). Obesity has been shown to be associated with earlier onset of metabolic conditions and diseases such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and dyslipidemia (50). These metabolic conditions may be underlying mechanisms for colorectal neoplasia. The time of body mass index (BMI) measurement relative to disease diagnosis is important when studying EOColorectal cancer (CRC), as weight loss is a common symptom (6). Therefore, body mass index (BMI) measured at the time of diagnosis may not be as relevant to body mass index (BMI) before diagnosis (49).  Table 4 Data adjustments for included studies.

54,discussion21,"	  Of the ten included studies, four exclusively included women (20–22, 24), four were over 50% women (25–28), one exclusively included males (29), and one was predominantly men (62% of participants under 50 years old and 68% of participants over 50 years old were male) (23). EOColorectal cancer (CRC) differs from older-onset Colorectal cancer (CRC) in that it affects men and women equally; however, it has not been determined if they also share the same risk factors (36). Due to the heterogeneity of the studies and their range of dietary measures, it was difficult to determine if specific diet components or approaches affected men and women's risk differently. A study with 62% male participants (23) and two studies with 100% female participants (22, 27) both found a pro-inflammatory diet to increase the risk of EOColorectal cancer (CRC) and adenomas.",960be0f3-d7c2-4f43-bad0-c03977dba1cb
55,discussion22," Furthermore, red meat's effect on EOColorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma risk was not statistically significant when comparing results from men and women (23, 25, 27, 29). When analyzing the demographics of the included studies', nine out of the ten studies included mostly white males and females (20–27, 29), and the tenth included only Pakistani participants (28). The studies with mostly white participants consistently found pro-inflammatory diets, such as the Western diet, and unhealthy foods including sugar sweetened beverage (SSB), fast food and desserts to have a negative impact of EOColorectal cancer (CRC) and early-onset adenoma risk (20, 22, 23, 27, 29). Healthy dietary choices such as fruits, vegetables and consuming high levels of various micronutrients appeared to be protective against EOColorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma risk in the studies with white participants (24–26, 29).",fd5ee649-a8a1-42ac-a550-384cdfa1668f
56,discussion23," When comparing the two predominant demographics of the included studies, refined foods and high fat foods increased EOColorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma risk, and a more plant-focused diet was protective against EOColorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma risk in both demographics (23, 26–29). The lack of diversity in the studies' participants limited the generalizability of the results, making it difficult to determine if similar dietary habits would affect other races in a comparable manner.  The strengths of this systematic review include reporting according to the PRISMA guidelines. Several limitations exist as well. While this review provides a summary of the most current evidence regarding diet and early-onset colorectal cancer, there were a limited number of studies included, and a meta-analysis could not be conducted due to the heterogeneity of the studies. A lack of dietary assessment of patients with EOColorectal cancer (CRC) is a limitation of the published research.",157dcbc8-258a-488d-bbcb-55bde622aaf6
57,discussion24," The age range of included participants is a limitation of this review. Currently, there is no clear or widely accepted consensus for a definition of age groups for EOColorectal cancer (CRC) (51). This study intended to adhere to the definition of early-onset as before screening age, i.e., < 50 years old, however; it was difficult due to the limited number of published studies. The mean age of cases in one study was 52.2, with 76.5% of cases being diagnosed before age 55 (20). The average age of cases in a second study was 41.47, with the standard deviation of ages from the mean was 15.54, therefore adults up to the age of 57 were included (28). Long follow-up studies with young individuals are cost-prohibitive; therefore there is a lack of diverse populations studied for EOColorectal cancer (CRC) and adenomas. Four of the included studies utilized the NHSII cohort for their data, limiting the diversity of the populations studied (20–22, 24).",a3e3e78d-ab3d-4658-8475-1e1c94149ed8
58,discussion25," Many of the included studies share similar limitations. While food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s are commonly used in nutrition research, they still are associated with recall bias, misclassification and measurement error. Though multiple countries were included across the studies, most participants were white and often female, reducing the generalizability of these results. It appears EOColorectal cancer (CRC) is similar between males and females, therefore the predominant inclusion of females is not a limitation of the results (7, 52, 53). The possibility of residual confounding factors cannot be ruled out in the observational studies due to the nature of the studies.  The rising incidence in early-onset colorectal cancer cases makes identifying risk factors imperative. More detailed studies on the differences in dietary index and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk by anatomic sites in young adults are needed.",336f3da6-2bb0-46d3-94b9-cf2bfdea1e12
59,discussion26," Large prospective cohort studies with long follow-ups are needed to confirm results and to help screen for strategies that can be targeted at this sub-population. Elucidating modifiable risk factors for early-onset colorectal cancer, such as diet, is necessary to help slow the rising incidence and preserve life years for the population.  Conclusions  This review demonstrated that various dietary habits, some of which are already confirmed risk factors for traditional colorectal cancer, may be risk factors or protective against early-onset colorectal cancer and adenomas. These results should be interpreted with caution, as a meta-analysis was not able to be conducted and the generalizability of the results is limited to the populations studied. The lack of knowledge on EOColorectal cancer (CRC) risk factors make the associations identified in this review helpful starting points for dietary habits to be examined in future studies.",76e24001-33d6-4f8e-a68f-41626229087c
