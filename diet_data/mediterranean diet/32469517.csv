0,methods0," 4.1. Animals and Diets  Adult male Wistar rats were purchased from Harlan Interfauna Ibérica S.A. (Barcelona, Spain). The experiments were approved according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Jaén, with code project number P.I.Universidad de Jaén (UJA)_2005_acción 14 (1 January 2006). Rats had free access to experimental diets and water during 24 weeks, and they were maintained under a controlled temperature (20–25 °C) and humidity (50 ± 5%) environment, in a 12 h light/dark cycle. At the beginning of the study, the mean body weight and age of animals were ±495 g and six months old, respectively. Experimental procedures for animal use and care were in accordance with European Communities Council Directive 2010/63/UE and Spanish regulation RD 53/2013, and the study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Jaén.",e0214ba9-d72e-4a0e-8e8c-9cac711b1b47
1,methods1," Rats were randomly assigned into three groups: in the standard diet (S, n = 6) group, rats were fed with a commercial chow for laboratory rodents (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) whose nutritional composition was 16.5% protein, 3% total fat, 60% carbohydrates (nitrogen-free extract (NFE)), 5% minerals, and 4% fiber. The other two diets were HFDs. One group of rats was fed with the S diet supplemented with 20% of virgin olive oil (virgin olive oil (20%) (VOO), n = 5), composed of a total fat content (%) of ω-9-monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid, C18:1) 75.5%, saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid, C16:0) 11.5%, and ω-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid (linoleic acid, C18:2) 7.5%). The second group of rats was fed with the S diet supplemented with 20% butter plus cholesterol (0.",d18e7091-db0f-4017-b384-8ba1fd7fb948
2,methods2,"1%) (Bch, n = 5), composed of a total fat content (%) of monounsaturated fatty acid (C18:1) 29%, saturated fatty acid (C16:0 y C18:0) 62%, polyunsaturated fatty acid (C16:0) 4%, and short and medium chain fatty acids (C4–C14). The Bch diet was supplemented with cholesterol (0.1%), in order to reach the average cholesterol content of the Western diet. The HFD diets were isocaloric, 1848 KJ/100 g and 1827 KJ/100 g for Evirgin olive oil (20%) (VOO) and Bch diets, respectively, compared to 1392 KJ/100 g S diet. The water and food intake of each group were measured during the balance periods.  After obtaining the blood samples, at the end of the experimental period the animals were perfused with a saline solution (9‰) through the left cardiac ventricle under Equithensin anesthesia (2 mL/kg body weight).",057a6a6a-fdc3-4537-87dd-937d336fd094
3,methods3," The left kidney was dissected, and the samples were immediately placed in liquid nitrogen to separate into two parts (cortex and renal medulla), as previously described [89], and were frozen at −80 °C until their use.  4.2. Systolic Blood Pressure, Water Intake and Diuresis Quantification  The systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) measurement was performed with the Letica-5000 measurer in unanesthetized animals, using the “tail-cuff” pneumatic plethysmography method as previously described [89,90]. The animals were placed in plastic holder and warmed to 37 °C for 15–20 min. Air was blown into the occlusion cuff until 250 mmHg was reached, the reference value for occlusion of the caudal artery. The occluder cuff was then abruptly deflated until an indicator light on the meter was signaled, corresponding to the systolic blood pressure (SBP) value and indicating the appearance of increased and turbulent blood flow as a result of hyperemia.",a0f82aa9-8d99-41ff-9315-a20ba6f20d28
4,methods4," At least seven measurements of systolic blood pressure (SBP) were carried out in each session, considering the mean of the three lowest values within a range of 5 mmHg as the systolic blood pressure (SBP) value. All measurements were performed during the same period of the day (10 a.m–12 a.m.), knowing systolic blood pressure (SBP) has diurnal variations.  Individual metabolism cages were used at the second and sixth experimental month, in order to obtain values of food and water intake, as well as urine excretion for each group. Urine samples were analyzed using a colorimetric reagent strip (Multistix, Siemens, Tarrytown, NY, USA) for the detection of leukocytes, nitrites, pH, protein, density, glucose, ketones, bilirubin.  4.3. Aminopeptidases Activities Assay  In order to obtain the soluble fraction, the tissue samples were homogenized with 0.5 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and ultracentrifuged at 100,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C.",a0e40a82-add2-4f94-889e-c7cffae555c1
5,methods5," The resulting supernatants were used to measure the enzymatic activities corresponding to the soluble fraction, and the protein content. To solubilize the membrane proteins, the pellets were rehomogenized in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) with 1% Triton-X-100, and ultracentrifuged at 100,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were kept for at least 4 h at 4 °C and shaken with SM-2 biobeads, in order to remove the detergent used to solubilize the membrane proteins. The resulting samples were used to measure the enzymatic activities of the membrane-bound fraction, and the protein content.",cdc0a2ea-0e77-4ef9-b0c1-b913a6ff6318
6,methods6,"  The enzymatic activities of soluble and membrane-bound fractions of AlaAP, ArgAP, AspAP, insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), GluAP, pGluAP and TyrAP, were measured by a fluorimetry assay using as substrates aminoacyl-β-Naphthylamides (aa-β-NA): L-Ala-β-NA, L-Arg-β-NA, L-Asp-β-NA, L-Cys-β-NA, L-Glu-β-NA, L-pGlu-β-NA, and L-Tyr-β-NA, respectively, according to the methods of different authors [91,92,93] modified by Prieto and Ramírez [71,94]. The 96-well black plates were used, and 10 µL of the supernatant sample was pipetted into each well and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 100 µL of substrate solutions. After 30 min of incubation, the enzymatic reactions were stopped by adding 100 µL of 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.2). The β-NA released as a result of the enzymatic activity, was quantified fluorometrically at 412 nm emission with an excitation of 345 nm. Each determination was made in triplicate.",4ba4c0c4-4f65-4f27-b19c-4316525e5785
7,methods7," The soluble and membrane-bound activities were expressed as pmoles of L-Ala-β-NA, L-Arg-β-NA, L-Asp-β-NA, L-Cys-β-NA, L-Glu-β-NA, L-pGlu-β-NA and L-Tyr-β-NA hydrolyzed per minute and per mg of protein (pmol aa-β-NA/min/mg prot).  4.4. Protein Measurement  For the quantification of proteins, the method of Bradford [95], based on the emission of light at 595 nm, was used. Bovine serum albumin (Bovine serum albumin (BSA)) was used as a standard.  4.5. Statistical Analysis  Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. When the normality test failed, Kruskal–Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks was performed. Significant differences were estimated with Sigmaplot v11.0 software (Systat Software, Inc., San José, CA, USA), and p-values below 0.05 (p < 0. 05) were considered statistically significant. All data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (standard error of the mean (SEM)).",314bc811-ccfd-45b7-ac85-1b37c2fe526e
8,methods8," Quantitative variables that were meant to be nonparametric univariate statistics, median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)) were used.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, this study presents new data regarding the aminopeptidases’ regulation on blood pressure control and local renal renin angiotensin system (RAS). The intake of saturated fat raised systolic blood pressure related to an increase of GluAP, and insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) activity in renal medulla. However, extra virgin olive oil presents a protective effect on systolic blood pressure, showing a slight increase in GluAP activity in the renal medulla, lower than in Bch diet.",38919bf0-8f65-4130-80e1-838f023bc0e4
9,methods9," Virgin olive oil seems present an indirect effect on the sympathetic system and the metabolic activity in kidney through changes on the TyrAP and pGluAP activities, reducing the release of tyrosine residues necessary for the formation of new catecholamines and the degradation of thyrotropin releasing hormone pGlu His Pro NH2 (TRH).
