Animals Male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River and then housed in a 12 h light/dark cycle, in a humidity and temperature (22 ± 2 °C)-controlled environment with ad libitum access to food and water. The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospitales Universitarios Virgen Macarena y Virgen del Rocío (Project identification code: 11-09-15-323). All procedures were performed in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines and Spanish legislation, and in accordance with EU Directives.  2.2. Diets All of the diets studied here were kindly designed by Dr Francisco J. G. Muriana from the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Nutrition, Instituto de la Grasa, CSIC, Seville, Spain.

The diets used in this study were: a standard normal-fat A04-10 diet (low-fat, low-cholesterol diet (low fat diet (LFD))) containing 3% of energy as fat, or three different high-fat, low-cholesterol custom diets (high fat diet (HFD)s), in which 24% of the energy was supplied through fat. The three different high fat diet (HFD)s were prepared by replacing the fat source from the A04-10 diet with: cow’s milk cream rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs, 24% energy, high-fat diet rich in saturated fatty acids (high fat diet (HFD)-SFA)), refined olive oil rich in MUFAs (24% energy, high-fat diet rich in olive oil (high fat diet (HFD)-OO)), or refined olive oil rich in MUFAs (23% energy) plus the omega-3 PUFAs, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), in the form of ethyl esters (1% energy, high fat diet (HFD)-OO-ω3).

The fatty acid composition of the dietary fats in each customized diet (high fat diet (HFD)-SFA, high fat diet (HFD)-OO and high fat diet (HFD)-OO-ω3) is shown in Table 2 and was similar to that described in [25].  2.4. Experimental Design The experimental protocol is shown in Figure 1. Six-week-old C57BL/6J mice were randomly allocated to the four experimental groups and fed for 4 weeks with low fat diet (LFD), high fat diet (HFD)-SFA, high fat diet (HFD)-OO, or high fat diet (HFD)-OO-ω3 diets before experimental cerebral ischemia was induced. The food pellets were replaced twice a week in order to prevent lipid peroxidation and body weight was monitored weekly throughout the experiment. Food intake was monitored for the first 10 days of the experiment.

Additional mice were allocated taking into account mortality and technical issues that arise during the experiments based on experience. Surgical inclusion criteria were: a reduction in blood flow to <25% of baseline value during the ischemia period, and a recovery of 75% of the baseline value in the reperfusion period. Mice that met the following criteria were excluded: (i) mice that failed to meet the inclusion criteria explained above (3 mice); and (ii) mice that died during the induction of middle cerebral artery occlusion (middle cerebral artery (MCA)o) (3 mice).  2.6.",b81f8483-3018-4d93-b0cb-0e311b43a93b

Edema was calculated using the following formula: Edema (%) = ((Ipsilateral Hemispheric Volume − Contralateral Hemispheric Volume) × 100)/Contralateral Hemispheric Volume.  The infarct severity was evaluated by performing a grayscale analysis of the tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o using 2 3 5 tetrazolium chloride (TTC)-stained brain sections, as described in [29,30], with slight modifications. The mean grayscale of the lesioned area of the hemisphere and the contralateral area were analysed in each mouse using the Image-J software, and the difference of both values was determined and expressed as an absolute value.",2d9f6e6c-68f9-4c2d-bdda-edaaf95e4230

All mice were habituated to the corridor over three training runs prior to testing and six different aspects of gait were then measured: fore and hind limb stride length, front and base width, overlap, stance, steps/m, and stride coordination (to determine the coordination between strides, the length of the shortest stride was subtracted from the length of the longest stride, as described in [39]). For each parameter, three values were obtained from each test session, excluding footprints made at the beginning and the end of the run, and footprints made by mice that walked along the corridor at an irregular speed. The footprints were scanned, and the distances were measured using Image Pro Plus software.

To analyse the adherence to the different diets, food intake was evaluated over the first 10 days of the experiment. Animals in the high fat diet (HFD)-SFA, high fat diet (HFD)-OO, and high fat diet (HFD)-OO-ω3 groups seemed to have a higher mean food intake those in the low fat diet (LFD) group, yet no significant differences were observed between the four experimental diets studied (Table 3).  3.2.",ecb189a3-5944-46a9-b905-dc206fcf5c13

21,methods21," Gait Analysis and Weight Loss The footprint test was performed 48 h after the onset of tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o to analyse how the high fat diet (HFD) with a specific fatty acid composition affected the gait impairment in mice. Several gait parameters were analysed: stride length, front and base width, overlap, stance, steps/m, and stride coordination. high fat diet (HFD)-OO-ω3 and low fat diet (LFD)-fed mice had better coordination of the paretic right hindlimb than high fat diet (HFD)-SFA-fed mice (Figure 8A). Moreover, mice fed with high fat diet (HFD)-OO-ω3 and low fat diet (LFD) took fewer steps per meter (steps/m) than animals fed with a high fat diet (HFD)-SFA diet (Figure 8B). Interestingly, animals fed with high fat diet (HFD)-OO did not show any improvement in any of these parameters compared to the rest of the groups.",6714fea8-0b5b-401f-b23d-c2ae3599973c
22,methods22," These results indicate that high fat diet (HFD) enriched in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and olive oil, and low-fat diets, can diminish the gait impairment in animals that suffer cerebral ischemia, as opposed to high fat diet (HFD)-SFA-fed mice. In addition, we analysed body weight as an indicator of the general welfare of the mice 48 h after tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o (Figure 8C). Thus, all animals subjected to focal cerebral ischemia experienced a 5% weight loss, with no significant differences between the groups.  3.7. Effect of Custom high fat diet (HFD)s on the Antioxidant Enzyme Activities in the Plasma The activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase (Catalase (CAT)), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were assessed 48 h after the induction of cerebral ischemia in the plasma from mice fed with low fat diet (LFD), high fat diet (HFD)-SFA, high fat diet (HFD)-OO, or high fat diet (HFD)-OO-ω3.",4e798355-ca2b-4e49-8c07-23143cab879e
23,methods23," Catalase (CAT) converts the hydrogen peroxide formed in injured tissues to oxygen and water. The activity of this antioxidant enzyme was significantly higher in mice fed high fat diet (HFD)-OO (Table 4). GPx reduces lipid peroxides to lipid alcohols and hydrogen peroxide to water, and GR catalyses the reduction of glutathione disulphide (GR catalyses the reduction of glutathione disulphide (GSSG)) to the sulfhydryl form of glutathione (glutathione (GSH)), which plays an important role in oxidative stress and preserves redox homeostasis in cells. We analysed the activity of GR and GPx in the plasma from mice fed with low fat diet (LFD), high fat diet (HFD)-SFA, high fat diet (HFD)-OO, or high fat diet (HFD)-OO-ω3, yet no significant differences between mice were found (Table 4).",4d73f240-d7b3-4775-b98d-56520b4e3f14
24,methods24," However, the mice fed with high fat diet (HFD)-OO and low fat diet (LFD) had a higher GR/GPx ratio than mice fed with high fat diet (HFD)-SFA, an indicator of the status of the glutathione redox system (Table 4).  4. Discussion In this study, we demonstrated that dietary fat composition influences the evolution of cerebral injury after tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o in mice. The beneficial effects of olive oil and omega-3 PUFA dietary supplementation were evident, both histologically and in neurological behaviour. We showed that a 4-week administration of a high-fat diet enriched in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and olive oil (high fat diet (HFD)-OO-ω3) significantly reduces the infarct area and infarct severity in mice subjected to focal cerebral ischemia. Moreover, a high fat diet (HFD)-OO-ω3 diet ameliorates the motor deficits and gait disturbance in these animals.",a4386e9f-5bdc-47f7-b7dd-0130f257ef77
25,methods25," The data also show that the administration of a high-fat diet enriched in olive oil (high fat diet (HFD)-OO) prior to cerebral ischemia protects against the ensuing neurological and motor deficits in mice. We reported an improvement in the evolution of cerebral damage and in neurocognitive function through the administration of diets enriched in olive oil and omega-3 long-chain fatty acids, reflecting the importance of the type of fat in the diet. These findings confirm the importance of the presence of omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fatty acids in the diet.  In recent years, the MUFAs and PUFAs present in olive oil and fish oil have been considered to be compounds with neuroprotective effects, particularly against the brain damage associated with stroke. The effectiveness of administering these fatty acids in models of brain ischemia prior to the ischemic insult has been reported in several studies [22,42,43,44].",60a2a9bf-1060-412e-89a9-cd36804875fc
26,methods26," Specifically, neuroprotective effects have also been seen in animals subjected to cerebral ischemia that were pre-treated with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [45,46], eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) [43,47], or fish oil containing both these omega-3 fatty acids [44,48]. In addition, recent studies have shown the beneficial effects of pre-treatment with olive oil, reducing infarct size and improving neurological outcomes in experimental models of brain ischemia [21,22]. In line with these studies, our results show that maintaining a diet enriched in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and olive oil reduced the brain damage and ameliorated the neurological deficit produced by ischemic insult, indicating the importance of dietary fat composition on the damage produced by stroke. We also show for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that the combination of olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids has a positive effect in a model of experimental stroke.",7d58165f-7743-4416-b6d3-495cb877f8f1
27,methods27,"  High-fat diets rich in SFAs are associated with a poor outcome in animal models of cerebral ischemia [7,49,50]. Long-term intake of a high fat diet (HFD) before traumatic brain injury altered the effects on cognitive function and the recovery sensorimotor activities, and it was associated with a greater loss of cortical tissue after the insult [11]. Even a short-term high fat diet (HFD) without obesity or the induction of a metabolic imbalance through the diet may be detrimental to brain vasculature, producing an exacerbated response to cerebral ischemia, particularly in terms of functional outcomes [14]. Similar effects of high fat diet (HFD)-SFA diets were observed under our experimental conditions, with a worse outcome in grip strength and gait after lesion in mice fed with a high fat diet (HFD)-SFA than in mice fed a low-fat diet (low fat diet (LFD)).",25381920-c3b8-4dbf-8037-0e57b1eb5e86
28,methods28," However, the motor deficits observed in the high fat diet (HFD)-SFA mice were in most cases reversed when SFAs were reduced by partial substitution with PUFAs (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) and MUFAs (from olive oil). In addition, mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) enriched in MUFAs from olive oil also produced better neurological scores and performed better in the grip test than mice in the high fat diet (HFD)-SFA and low fat diet (LFD) groups. Taken together, these results indicate the beneficial effects of the partial substitution of SFAs with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and MUFAs from olive oil in mice subjected to cerebral ischemia.  There are additional consequences linked to high fat diet (HFD) consumption, such as the induction of systemic inflammatory responses.",cb77ba9c-58b8-4d0a-bc5c-1dbf2b80a435
29,methods29," High-fat diets are characterized by a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio and it is well-known that a higher intake of omega-6 fatty acids may induce a proinflammatory state [51]. Several studies have demonstrated that stroke patients generally maintain an unhealthy diet, and this is an important factor in the poor outcome of ischemic stroke [6,7,14]. Moreover, a worse outcome in patients following ischemic stroke has been related to neuroinflammation [6,7].  We consider that the composition of dietary fat may influence and modulate the outcome of stroke and the patient’s subsequent evolution by regulating antioxidant and anti-inflammatories activities.",d130a0e6-1a41-46d1-ac2e-eac8de386d43
30,methods30," Olive oil has antioxidant and neuroprotective properties [52], and recent studies demonstrated the positive properties of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment after middle cerebral artery (MCA)o in rat stroke models, producing a reduction in infarct volume and edema, and an improvement in the neurological deficits due to the activation of NPD1 synthesis [53,54]. Furthermore, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduces apoptosis in the brain by stimulating antiapoptotic processes, dampening responses to ROS, downregulating the expression of proapoptotic proteins, upregulating the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, and preserving mitochondrial function and integrity [55]. Combining multiple agents that target different cellular pathways could maximize the suppression of ischemic signalling, as we have shown in this study, producing additive or synergic effects and improving the outcomes after cerebral ischemia.  A healthy diet is an important part of stroke prevention [56].",1b56efd3-811e-4ccd-8fab-97cd3f9cca7b
31,methods31," International guidelines recommend the reduction of saturated fats, cholesterol intake (such as butter, cream), and high salt diets to prevent vascular risks [1]. Nevertheless, diets enriched in bioactive compounds may also help to reduce brain damage when a stroke occurs. As we have shown here, the consumption of a diet rich in olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids before the ischemic insult occurs may protect the brain and minimize the damage produced. This strategy could be a healthy recommendation especially for patients at high risk of a stroke. Indeed, this type of diet could be a candidate to prove what we proposed previously, a novel alternative approach referred to as advanced neuroprotection strategy [57]. Further research will be required to explore the benefits of this approach.  We should also mention the limitations of this study, such as evaluating the outcome in the acute phase (24–48 h) and only using male mice.",0cc7c13b-1086-4780-97f1-7ff2b32792a4
32,methods32," Further studies are warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms and to define which type of dietary fat improves short and long-term stroke outcomes in both female and male mouse models, in different strains, or when faced with co-morbid conditions, as well as in aged mice that might better resemble stroke patient profiles.  5. Conclusions This work provides novel evidence of the early impact of a high fat diet (HFD) enriched in olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids on the outcomes and neurological function after stroke.
