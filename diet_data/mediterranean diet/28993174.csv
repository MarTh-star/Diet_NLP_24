0,background0,"The Mediterranean diet (MeD) is considered one of the healthiest dietetic pattern in the world [1]. It is characterized by a high consumption of olive oil, fish, fruits, legumes, vegetables, unrefined cereals, a moderate consumption of wine and dairy products, and a low consumption of non-fish meat products [2]. According to several studies, thanks to its peculiar distribution of macro and micronutrients, this dietary model plays a key role in the prevention of a wide number of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (CDVs), diabetes and metabolic syndrome [3–5], making an important contribution to the weight loss, especially if it is associated with energy restriction and constant physical activity [6]. In view of above, it is worth recalling that this dietary models can also prevent and treat obesity [7], a disease, usually classified through that provides alterations in body composition like abnormal or excessive fat accumulation [8–10].",9cbd47b1-5139-4122-a372-aed8592cc6de
1,background1," This medical condition is caused by a several numbers of co-factors, such as psychological problems, sedentary life and incorrect dietetic habits [11, 12], and it is an important risk factor for all those aforementioned diseases fought by the Mediterranean diet [13]. Therefore, in this context, it is understandable why this dietary model plays a key role in the health protection.  Nevertheless, independently from the dietetic habits, also genetics play a key role in the development of obesity [14]. In the human genome, a several number of genes are involved in the obesity, and Fat mass and obesity-associated gene (Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO)) is surely one of the most important. This gene, widely expressed in several fetal and adult tissues, is located on chromosome 16 (16q12.2), and encodes for the enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase [15].",167b1095-b91a-49c5-8c23-fa77bab44df4
2,background2," This enzyme is implied in the regulation of both the control of adipocyte thermogenesis and differentiation, contributing considerably to the body fat accumulation [16]. Furthermore, it contributes to the regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic rate [17], increasing also the food intake [18]. Finally, among the other activities, is implicated in the repairs of alkylated DNA and RNA via oxidative demethylation [19]. Among the several variants of this gene, Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 is one of the best-know. It is located in the first intron of the gene and, in 2007, it was for the first time associated with the body mass [20]. Subsequently, further studies demonstrated that the allele A of Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 is related to both a higher body mass index and body circumferences [21, 22], and, among different ethnicities, also Italian population demonstrated the same results [23].",ec0f4734-c8a9-45a4-8ae3-054b14aed053
3,background3," Furthermore, this SNP is included among the genetic etiological factors in the development of both metabolic syndrome and Type-2 diabetes [24, 25], and allele A was also associated with a higher fat and lean mass [26, 27]. In a PREDIMED substudy, it was observed that homozygous subjects for A allele had the highest baseline body weight, but also the lowest body weight gain after 3 years of Mediterranean-style intervention, compared to TT genotype. However, no interaction between nutritional intervention and the polymorphism was found [28, 29]. On the other hand, Ortega-Azorín et al. [30] demonstrated consistent gene-diet interactions between Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 and Melanocortin-4 Receptor (MC4R) rs17782313 genes and to the Mediterranean diet adherence in the type 2 diabetes risk. The same effect was observed in obese phenotypes in Iranian population.",aaf45ea5-40f7-492a-9c7e-a4b21e58b570

In the light of these observations the objective of this study was to investigate about the possible influence of Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 variant on both weight loss and modification of body composition in Italian subjects, after having followed a 4-weeks dietetic intervention based on the Mediterranean model, in order to see if this polymorphism could influence the response to a specific dietary treatment.

24,discussion0,"Among the different dietetic patterns, the Mediterranean diet is surely one of the healthiest in the world [1]. In fact, several studies demonstrated its capability to prevent different cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, such as metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes [2, 4, 5]. Moreover, this type of dietetic model turns out to be fundamental both in preventing and treating the obesity [6, 42], which is becoming one of the most widespread medical condition in the world, since recent statistics demonstrated that, by 2030, the 20% of the global adult population will be obese, and the 38% will be overweight [43]. Nevertheless, also genetics plays an important role in the development of the obesity [14]. So far, a wide number of genes are associated with the body composition, and one of the most studies is certainly Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO).",d7a1c7f5-c10b-405b-a676-8dd86e3df556
25,discussion1," Several variants of this gene were associated with the BMI, and Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 is certainly one of the most known [44, 45]. In fact, its allele A is highly related with higher BMI [20, 46], fat and lean mass [26, 27]. On the contrary, for the time being, several studies demonstrated that, during a dietetic treatment, Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 do not seem to influence the weight loss [28, 47]. In view of above, we have conducted this study in order to analyze whether and how Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 variant influence both weight loss and body composition in Italian patients, within a Mediterranean dietetic treatment.  According to our results, total body water (TBW) is highly influenced by Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO).",c5e6f2e4-cda5-4cf8-b006-c7b663c50604
26,discussion2," In fact, analyzing the alteration of this value in each group (Table 4), it is possible to see that A carriers lost a higher quantity of body water compared to TT genotype (MeD/TT genotype = − 0.83 ± 1.63; control group (CTR)/TT genotype = 0.70 ± 3.04; MeD/A carriers = − 1.88 ± 4.35; control group (CTR)/A carriers = − 1.75 ± 3.28) (Table 4), whilst no difference due to MeD intervention was found. This result may be a confounding factor in the weight loss, since it influences the decreasing of both BMI and body weight during nutritional treatments, overestimating the effective fat mass loss. Analyzing the results of body composition evaluated via dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA), both dietetic treatment and interaction diet-gene influence the total body fat mass, whilst Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) alone did not demonstrate the same effect.",60672547-3b99-4d40-8eef-1e0f7626ddaa
27,discussion3," Moreover, Gynoid BFat% declining was highly related to the dietetic therapy, confirming that MeD treatment had an effect on body composition, confirming its capabilities, already demonstrated in several studies [48, 49], to reduce body fat, giving its important contribution against all the diseases related to the body fat mass. In our sample, the difference between the two nutritional treatments is highly considerable, since both MeD groups lost weight in a similar manner. It is also important to highlight that, in our sample, Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) did not influence the outcome of the nutritional treatment, thus confirming the results of previous studies [28, 50]. These results might mean that, during a dietetic therapy, this SNP should not be taken into consideration, since it does not influence the outcome of both body composition and anthropometric measurements.",81edb93e-cb96-4d7b-86a2-749bf5e9d930
28,discussion4," However, the fact that also the interaction gene-diet had an effect on the TBFat suggests that, even though slightly, Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) might influence the outcome of the Mediterranean diet on this specific value, as previously proposed by another study [51]. Nonetheless, analyzing our results, it can be assumed that this statistical significance may be given by the incredible amount of TBFat gained by the A carriers/control group (CTR) group, thus suggesting an interesting role of this SNP in the development and preservation of body fat mass outside periods of nutritional therapies, as previously assumed by studies on murine models [18, 52].",48bd2862-300c-44f8-bbb6-380a66c5aaa5
29,discussion5," Considering these results, we suggest that understanding whether and how Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO), along with other genes or alone, influence the fat mass loss during nutritional treatments could help us to draft better clinical pictures of patients, and prevent difficulties of weight loss due to genetic factors. Moreover, both nutritional treatment and Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) alleles did not influence the lean mass, which, in contrast to the fat mass, remained almost steady within the studied period in all the analyzed groups. Finally, according to the statistical significance, in our sample, Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 did not influence body circumferences, weight, and consequently BMI.",b4b9804a-4114-4ba7-be0d-7b76754147f5

Conclusions To conclude, Mediterranean diet confirmed to be useful in the prevention and treatment against obesity, since it demonstrated, in our sample, to reduce the body fat mass. On the contrary, data about Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) remain uncertain, and considering the importance of this SNP in the relation with BMI and body composition, further studies are needed to clarify definitely whether this SNP influences the outcome of the dietetic therapies.",bce5d1ef-3fd9-42da-9404-322df64bae90
