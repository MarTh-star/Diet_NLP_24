0,methods0," Population  In this study 121 individuals (67–84 years) were recruited from a population-based cohort on aging, the Seniors-ENRICA-2 cohort in Spain. The cohort was established in order to examine the associations between lifestyle and healthy aging in older adults (18). This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Research Committee of the «La Paz» University Hospital (Madrid). The participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.”  Studied Samples  The 121 Individuals included in the study were selected using a nested case-control design. Cases (n = 61) were individuals affected by T2DM based on self-reported physician’s diagnosis and/or being on anti-diabetic treatment (oral medication or insulin) at the time of data collection. Controls (n = 60) were selected concurrently and were free of diabetes at the time of data collection.",031361af-37b1-4e50-aff2-be86f2005170
1,methods1," For the present study, we used the following information from each participant: sex, age (years)—categorized as old (i.e., 67–75 year) and oldest old (i.e., 76–84 y), body mass index (BMI) (calculated as measured weight in kg divided by the square of measured height in m), T2DM status, smoker status (never, former, current), food consumption, and adherence to the MedDiet.  Dietary Surveys and Assessment of Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet  Food consumption data were collected using a validated electronic diet history (19). Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was assessed by calculating the MedDiet assessed using an adapted (MEDAS) score (20). The MedDiet assessed using an adapted (MEDAS) score ranges from 0 to 13, with higher values indicating higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet.",fd0ebec8-7e53-40b1-8134-16b6ccd2c27f
2,methods2," We restricted the analysis to the 11 MedDiet assessed using an adapted (MEDAS) items describing the consumption of food groups, namely olive oil, cooking with olive oil, vegetables, fruits, red meat, butter/margarine/cream, carbonated sweet drinks, wine, legumes, fish/shellfish, sweet snacks (confectionary, biscuits, and commercial pastries), and nuts. For each food group, the participants were classified as high or low consumers based on the cut-off points defined for the MedDiet assessed using an adapted (MEDAS) score calculation. High consumers or each “healthy” food item scored 1 on MedDiet assessed using an adapted (MEDAS) and low consumers scored zero, whilst high consumers of the food items red meat, butter/margarine/cream, carbonated sweet drinks and sweet snacks scored zero and low consumers scored 1.",8b693259-2ba3-47b6-ac42-34401b4f4397
3,methods3,"  Oral Health Questionnaire  Oral health was assessed by questionnaire (Supplementary Table 1) containing the following features: mouth condition was scored from very good (1) to poor (5); wearing of dentures (yes or no); number of visits to the dentist, from less than 1, 1, 2 or greater than 2 visits per year (scored 1–4); oral health was scored from 0 to 5 based on presence of the following items, each scoring 1: bleeding gums, painful gums, painful teeth, mouth ulcers, loss of 2 or more teeth in last 2 years.  Saliva Sampling and Handling  Participants collected unstimulated saliva at home early in the morning after overnight fasting. Drinking water was permitted up to 5 min before saliva collection and participants sat comfortably, tilted their heads slightly downwards, allowed saliva to pool on the floor of the mouths and spat into 40 ml polypropylene tubes.",751fbab0-1a3a-4b34-aa33-f6f3589dec0b
4,methods4," Sampling was performed for 10 min but in case a participant wished to stop before the end of the 10 min, the time was recorded in order to be able to calculate the saliva flow (expressed in mL/min and categorized as follows normal (> or = 0.25 mL/min), low (0.1–0.24 mL/min), or hypofunctional (<0.1 mL/min) (21). Saliva samples were immediately placed on ice, transported to the laboratory, and placed at -80°C as soon as possible (never longer than 4 h on ice). At the end of the collection from the participants, samples were shipped to the analytical facilities on dry ice.  DNA Extraction and 16S rRNA Gene Pyrosequencing  DNA was extracted from saliva samples using the GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA extraction kit (NA2120, Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s instructions with an additional lysozyme (45 mg/ml) (89833, Thermo Fisher Scientific) incubation step for 30 min at 37°C.",585aced8-21ce-45a3-b72d-4500145c2b0a
5,methods5," DNA purity and integrity were evaluated via NanoDrop 7000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and 1% agarose (BIO-41025, Bioline) gel electrophoresis, respectively, and DNA was stored at -80°C for subsequent experiments. The V1-V2 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using a 27F-YM and 338R-R forward and reverse tagged primer pairs (Eurofins Genomics) in a polymerase chain reaction (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)). A negative control (no template) was included on each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plate and the ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community DNA Standard (D6305, Cambridge Bioscience) was added as a sample in the library and used as a positive control to evaluate the quality of the sequencing.",798edbe1-c72d-419b-b2e0-39c3cbd09d8c
6,methods6," The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) program was: initial denaturation at 98°C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 10 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were run on a 1% agarose gel with GelRed§ Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (41002, Biotium) to confirm successful amplification of the ∼350-bp fragment. The purified amplicon polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were quantitated using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (P7589, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and pooled at equal quantities. In order to achieve successful cluster amplification, the pooled polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were further cleaned up using QIAquick polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Purification columns (28106, Qiagen). Pools were quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (10606433, Fisher Scientific Ltd.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",02e14ce8-57bb-4366-8efe-226f40be7e88
7,methods7," Then, pools were diluted to the same concentration and mixed at the same ratio to get the final sequencing pool. The library was sent to the Genome Centre at Queen Mary University London for multiplex sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of the tagged samples.  Bioinformatics and Statistical Analysis  A total of 3,788,644 raw sequences were obtained from MiSeq Illumina sequencing. The Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm (DADA2) pipeline of R software (version 1.8.0) was used for quality-filtering, trimming, error correction, exact sequence inference, chimera removal, and generation of amplicon sequence variant tables (amplicon sequence variant tables (ASV)) (22). The final dataset contained an average of 24,621 sequences per sample, leading to a total 6,840 amplicon sequence variant tables (ASV)s. Bacterial taxonomic classification was determined by reference to the Human Oral Microbiome Database (Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD)).",dc83a8c3-1d8b-478d-8f57-931dd2ab305e
8,methods8," Diversity indices such as Observed, Shannon, and Inverse Simpson were calculated using the DADA2 R package and compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. For the ordination plot, multi-dimensional scaling (multi dimensional scaling (MDS)) was performed using Bray-Curtis distances. Group differences by diabetic status on the ordination plot were calculated based on the PERMANOVA test (R vegan package). Contrasted taxa were investigated by R DESeq2 negative binomial tests. The Dirichlet multinomial mixtures method was applied to identify optimal numbers of distinct clusters representing unique oral microbiome communities (23).  Participant cohort characteristics, dietary intake, and health characteristics were expressed as means ± SD and compared by Chi-square tests. ",645a2abd-9465-4147-893e-6ab6b7b9a704
9,results0," Participant Characteristics  Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the participants included in the current study. There were no differences in gender or age distributions; smoking and MedDiet assessed using an adapted (MEDAS) score between the T2DM and non-T2DM groups (P > 0.05). In total, 21 out of 56 diabetic participants had obesity and 8 of 56 were lean (body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2) whilst 14 out of 60 non-T2DM participants had obesity and 16 out of 60 were lean (Table 1). Oral health was similar in T2DM and non-T2DM participants as revealed by the oral health questionnaire (Supplementary Table 1). Salivary flow rates varied from 0.005 to 1 ml/min and mean salivary flow rate was not reduced in the T2DM group compared to controls, but 20 out of 61 in the T2DM group had salivary gland hypofunction (<0.1 ml/min) compared 12 out of 60 non-T2DM participants (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1).",40f26e5a-d6a5-453d-8807-a7120fac9131
10,results2,"  Intake of Dietary Components Comprising the MedDiet Assessed Scores  The numbers of high and low consumers of 11 food groups separated by T2DM status are presented in Table 2. The dietary patterns were overall comparable between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals except for one food group, “sweets snacks” (confectionary and commercial pastries) which showed a higher proportion of high consumers among non-T2DM subjects. Correlation analysis of selected food items from the MedDiet assessed using an adapted (MEDAS) score indicated that some were better correlated with T2DM or high body mass index (BMI) (Supplementary Figure 1).

11,results4,"  Salivary Microbiome Richness and Diversity in Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus and Non-type-2 Diabetes Mellitus Subjects  Following assessment of the quality of isolated DNA, we generated a total of 109 samples of oral metagenomics data based on 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Rarefaction curves were plotted to verify the efficiency of the sequencing process (Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 2). Using the R Dada2 software package, we pre-processed short reads and checked observed amplicon sequence variants (amplicon sequence variant tables (ASV)s) by the sequencing depths, observing no increase in the number above our minimal sequencing depth; those samples (n = 5) with less than the minimal depth were excluded from the analysis (Supplementary Figure 2). Therefore, the final number of samples for assessment of the microbial community was n = 99.  The microbial diversity of the oral microbiome was determined in T2DM and non-T2DM participants (Figure 1).",429f2d3c-0964-4646-9545-7101bbe8b45f
12,results5," Based on the number of observed species, the Observed diversity, Shannon, and Inverse Simpson indices, indicated significantly decreased alpha-diversity of the oral microbiome in T2DM participants (Wilcoxon rank sum tests p < 0.05 or p < 0.01; Figures 1A–C). Overall, this was also true when the analysis was stratified by weight status (Figure 1E), although the difference reached statistical significance only for participants with obesity. We also performed multi-dimensional scaling of Bray-Curtis distances of all samples and observed distinct separations of diabetic and non-diabetic groups (PERMANOVA p-value < 0.01; Figure 1D).  FIGURE 1 Analysis of microbial diversity. Based on (A) observed, (B) Shannon, and (C) inverse Simpson diversity, we found that alpha-diversity of oral microbiota decreased among diabetic groups (** Wilcoxon rank sum tests p-value < 0.01).",c9a7f3bd-d0d0-4b86-83a1-30d9d832da02

Bacterial Community Structure of the Salivary Microbiome in Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus and Non-type-2 Diabetes Mellitus Groups  The relative contributions of the more dominant bacterial genera were not significantly different between the T2DM and non-T2DM groups although there was a trend suggesting increased abundance of Veillonella and Lactobacillus in T2DM (Figures 2A,D,E). There was a significant reduction in the proportion of “Others,” the grouped less-dominant genera, as exemplified by Tannerella and Dialister (Wilcoxon rank sum tests, one-sided, p-values < 0.005; see Figures 2B,C and Supplementary Table 3).",6d954ef3-a824-4705-8af9-0298eb8f16e3
14,results7," Based on correlation analysis, we found that many taxa negatively correlated with T2DM status were positively correlated with MedDiet status, possibly reversing T2DM-specific microbial community (Figure 2F).

15,results8,"  To identify optimal numbers of distinct clusters representing unique oral microbiome communities, we applied an unsupervised clustering method, Dirichlet multinomial mixtures, which has been applied to identify “enterotype,” which represents unique gut microbial community structure associated with diets, lifestyle and dysbiosis (24) (Figure 3A). Here we observed three distinct clusters herein called salivatypes. Salivatype-1 was enriched with the genera Streptococcus, Rothia and Veillonella whereas salivatype-2 was enriched in Prevotella, Actinomyces and Veillonella and salivatype-3 with Neisseria and Porphyromonas (Figures 3A,D). Interestingly, we found significant changes of salivatype proportions between the T2DM and non-T2DM groups with salivatype-1 increased among diabetic participants, and salivatype 3 was increased among non-diabetic participants (Figure 3B and Supplementary Table 4). Salivatype 2 was enriched in obese subjects.",f8a45ff0-c554-4d9d-9bef-2cb60b0091d2
16,results9," Salivatype 1 had a reduced diversity compared to salivatypes 2 and 3 (Figure 3C), and there was a reduced proportion of the less dominant genera, grouped as “Others” (Figure 3D). Salivatype 1 when present in non-T2DM, obese, and non-obese subjects had a similar decreased diversity (Supplementary Figure 3).  FIGURE 3 Hidden microbial community structure (salivatype) among diabetic and non-diabetic groups. (A) Based on unsupervised clustering, we identified three clusters of different microbial compositions, named salivatype 1, 2, and 3. Salivatype 1 was enriched in Streptococcus, salivatype 2 enriched in Prevotella, and salivatype-3 enriched in Neisseria. (B) Salivatype-1 was enriched among diabetic subjects compared to non-diabetic subjects (Chi-square tests p-value = 0.116).

17,results10," Streptococcus was highly enriched in salivatype1, as compared to other salivatypes (Wilcoxon rank sum tests p-value = 1.2 × 10–5). T2D, Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Relative Abundance of Microbiome Genera in Participants of Differing Body Mass Index Status or Adherence to a Mediterranean Diet  Figures 4A,B show the relative abundance of the microbiome salivatypes in obese (n = 30) compared to non-obese (n = 66) participants and the median body mass index (BMI) values of participants showing each salivatype. There is a trend of reduction in salivatype 3 in obese subjects, accompanied by an increased abundance of salivatype 2 compared with lean participants.  FIGURE 4 Different enrichment of salivatype (SL) in obesity and in relation to consumption of food groups.

18,results11," (B) Salivatype-2 was associated with a high median body mass index (BMI) (ANOVA p-value = 0.082). Together, (C) sweet snacks, (D) fish, and (E) nuts were differently consumed among subjects with different salivatypes (Chi-square tests, p-values < 0.1) and their coordinate changes were associated with salivatypes (PERMANOVA p-value = 0.008).  Salivatype 2 tended to be associated with a higher (7–11) MedDiet assessed using an adapted (MEDAS) score whilst a low (≤ 6) MedDiet assessed using an adapted (MEDAS) score tended to be associated with a salivatype 1 microbiome, but these were not statistically significant differences. When single dietary items included in the MedDiet assessed using an adapted (MEDAS) score were considered, there was a lower consumption of sweet snacks in participants with increased presence of salivatype 1. The items on eating of fish and nuts were greater in those with increased presence of salivatype 3. Collectively these food (i.e.",1a487f06-403d-4a40-999e-74d6d161724a

20,discussion0," In this study of older adults, we observed a reduced richness and diversity of the salivary microbiome in T2DM, a result which agrees with some previous studies (4, 5, 25). However, T2DM has been associated with an increased prevalence of periodontal disease and subjects with the latter can show an increased oral microbial diversity and richness (25). We used a questionnaire to assess the oral health of participants and it asked about a diagnosis of periodontal disease, the presence of bleeding and painful gums, and loss of 2 or more teeth in the last 2 years; the responses to these questions suggested that levels of periodontitis were similar in both the T2DM and non-T2DM groups.  The most abundant genera in this study, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Neisseria, Rothia, Porphyromonas, and Haemophilus have similarly been observed previously (7, 26, 27).",20466acd-9f68-4ff6-8b01-a4b972152c7d
21,discussion1," Comparison of the relative abundances of bacterial genera in T2DM and non-T2DM participants suggested that the major genera Veillonella and Lactobacillus tended to be increased but this did not reach statistical significance. Such changes might implicate the over-production of lactate in the microbial community of subjects with T2DM, due to altered host metabolism. There were also decreases in the relative presence of non-dominant genera in T2DM, which needs further investigation of their roles as keystone species.  Unsupervised clustering of the microbiome sequencing data suggests 3 salivatypes characterized by distinct relative abundances of some major bacterial genera. Recently, similar unsupervised clustering was applied to the gut (fecal) microbiome and microbial community signatures were identified, suggesting distinct communities of the gut microbiome, referred to as enterotypes (28).",54bbf2d8-4be2-43c5-b9cc-2acf26436e3f
22,discussion2," Co-occurring and co-excluding genera of the salivatypes identified in the present study, show many similarities with the distinct clustering of the salivary microbiome described previously in healthy subjects (7). We found that salivatype 1 (increased Streptococcus, Veillonella, Rothia) was predominant in subjects with T2DM, which supports a similar finding of combined increases in Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Rothia in a previous study of diabetic compared to normoglycemic subjects (5). The increases in genera containing aciduric species may be due to altered host metabolism of sugar to lactate, and further metabolism of lactate by species in the genus Veillonella may contribute to the resilience of the oral microbiome to acidification (3, 29). There was predominance of a different microbiome-related salivatype (SL2) in obese subjects, compared to lean subjects. Salivatype 2 is characterized by increased Prevotella and Actinomyces.",5ac5c46f-e348-48a3-8640-ec7dffd5e6c2
23,discussion3," It has previously be found that obesity alters the composition and diversity of the oral microbiome in patients with T2DM independently of glycemic control (4), and that Prevotella and Actinomyces species are increased in the salivary microbiome of obese adults without periodontal disease (30).  Although the (MedDiet assessed using an adapted (MEDAS)) scoring of adherence to a Mediterranean diet did not differ between T2DM and non-T2DM groups or subjects with and without obesity, a combination of three dietary items (low sugar snacks, high fish/shellfish and high nuts) were associated with an altered microbial community structure. Subjects consuming fewer sweet snacks, showed an enrichment of salivatype 1, whilst those consuming more fish and nuts, showed enrichment in salivatype 3. An association of salivatype 1 with low sugary snacks and T2DM seems logical since sugary snacks were consumed less frequently in the T2DM group.",0b24e721-55fa-4992-97a2-6feeae27da28
24,discussion4,"  The present study has some limitations, including the selection of subjects based on diabetic status and the absence of a clinical assessment of oral health. In a future study saliva samples should be collected longitudinally from subjects with T2DM, subjects with obesity and matched control subjects, before and after adoption of a Mediterranean diet. We used 16SrRNA gene amplification and sequencing, which has been shown to capture the majority of bacterial taxa in many previous studies of the oral microbiome (31). We did not use whole genome sequencing in this study; although there are a number of advantages over 16SrRNA gene amplification sequencing, including bacterial classification down to species and strain level, characterization of fungal species and the microbial resistome (32); a further consideration was that saliva sample volume was limited, since other omics analyses were undertaken (33).",2e306be3-c2f6-47e0-93e8-32a33ebbc7d2
25,discussion5," A future longitudinal study should utilize genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing of saliva, rather than 16SrRNA gene amplification and sequencing, which would provide more detail of the structure and function of the microbial community, especially the community of minor microbial taxa, in T2DM, obesity and its response to components of the MedDiet. If salivary microbiome biomarkers are validated in such a study then these could be usefully employed in monitoring adherence to a MedDiet and the course of metabolic disease.
