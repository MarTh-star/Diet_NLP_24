0,introduction0,"Depression affects over 350 million people worldwide and is considered to be a major contributor to global disability [1]. The annual economic cost of depression in Europe has been estimated at up to €118 billion [counting direct costs (outpatient care, drug cost, hospitalization) and indirect costs due to morbidity and mortality], making depression the most costly brain disorder in Europe [2]. In a context where conventional treatments only address one-third of the disease burden linked to mood [3], it may be crucial to identify modifiable risk factors on which intervention strategies can be based. Amongst those modifiable risk factors, dietary behaviours have raised increased interest in the last few years [4].  Research to date has focused on the associations of specific nutrients like fatty acids [5–9] and B vitamins, such as B6, B9 and B12 [6, 10–12] with depression.",5c302fa2-cedc-4247-8c42-8fec21066d59
1,introduction1," Results of those studies are inconclusive and research has increasingly moved from focusing on the effect of isolated nutrients to those of dietary patterns/indices, aiming the consideration of overall effect of diet on depression. Dietary indices measure the quality of a diet by calculating healthy diet scores based on dietary guidelines. Similarities in the recommendations for a healthy diet are a high intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and a low intake of red or processed meats. Differences between dietary indices are the method used to calculate the dietary scores and inclusion of specific food items or nutriments (such as sodium, alcohol, sweet beverages).  Our recent systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies assessed the association between healthy dietary scores and depressive outcomes and concluded that adhering to a healthy diet appears to confer some protection against depression [13].",016ffd12-f235-4308-a9c9-9cee5cb4ad0e
2,introduction2," Amongst the studied dietary indices, the Mediterranean Diet Score was the most examined index, regarding depressive symptoms/depression and was robustly associated to the incidence of depressive symptoms/depression [13]. Other indices such as the Alternate Healthy Eating Index of 2010 and the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension have also been studied in relation to depressive symptoms/depression [13]. However, longitudinal studies assessing the long-term impact of dietary habits on depressive disorders remain scarce. Even though some studies provide evidence that the quality of diet is associated with depressive symptoms/disorders, they also suggest that more prospective studies are needed to confirm this association [14].  Temporality is a major issue in the assessment of the healthy diet-depression relation, especially in a public health context and dietary guidelines to reduce the risk of depressive symptoms.",a023d813-c628-4a74-a0c5-c641b0172b5f
3,introduction3,"  Accordingly, we aimed to examine whether long-term adherence to the existing dietary recommendations,  assessed by the Alternate Healthy Eating Index using the 2010 criteria (AHEI-2010), ﻿the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) and the transformed Mediterranean Diet Score (tMDS), are associated with the recurrence of depressive symptoms assessed over 13 years in a British cohort of men and women. ",a69f8a5d-fff0-47c9-b956-fd866de2cf2c
4,methods1," 4949 participants were thus included in main analyses as detailed in the flow-chart diagram (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Flow chart diagram mapping the selection of participants    Depressive symptoms (DepS) assessed over a 13 year period (2002/2004–2015/2016) Depressive symptoms (DepS) were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [16]. This scale is composed of 20 items matching DepS, the frequency of DepS was evaluated using a four-point scale. The scale ranges from ‘less than once a week’ to ‘5–7 days a week’. Participants self-reported details of current medications use (generic name, brand name, or both); these were subsequently coded using the British National Formulary to determine antidepressant use. We defined cases of DepS as participants with a CES-D score ≥ 16 or those treated by antidepressants at four phases (2002/2004, 2007/2009, 2012/2013 and 2015/2016).",d0717ef1-1f29-4355-96ae-0a96c15730ab
5,methods2,"  Recurrence of DepS was defined as presenting DepS at two, three or all the four phases of follow-up, while non-recurrent cases were defined when participants reported one or no DepS episodes over the 13 years of follow-up.  Assessment of dietary intake Dietary intake was assessed in 1991/1993, 1997/1999 and 2002/2004 with a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [17, 18] based on one used in US Nurses' Health study [19]. Participants were asked how often, on average, they had consumed a common unit or portion size of each food item during the previous year. A nine-point scale was used to assess the frequency at which food items were consumed. The scale ranges from ‘never or less than once per month’ to ‘six or more times per day’. Daily food consumption was computed for each participant based on the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).",c8be3b28-86d5-4bbb-a586-b6f0926efb67
6,methods3," Nutrient intakes were calculated by multiplying the consumption frequency for each food by its nutrient content (for specified portions) and then summing nutrient contributions from all foods. This was done using the computerized system developed for the Whitehall II dietary data and based on the 4th and 5th editions of McCance and Widdowson’s The Composition of Foods and supplementary tables as detailled elsewhere [20].  Diet indices Scores Three dietary scores assessing the overall diet quality were derived from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data at all three phases:  The Alternate Healthy Eating Index of 2010 (AHEI-2010) [21] is based on 11 components, six components for which the highest intakes are considered to be ideal (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and legumes, long chain omega-3 fats (DHA and EPA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids), one component for which moderate intake was supposed to be ideal (alcohol),",942248f9-7c2d-4f06-85d5-9e61eaa75433
7,methods4," and four components for which avoidance or lowest intake are considered to be ideal (sugar-sweetened drinks and fruit juice, red and processed meat, trans fat, and sodium). Each component is given a minimal score of 0 and a maximal score of 10, with intermediate values scored proportionally. All the component scores are summed to obtain a total AHEI-2010 score, which ranges from 0 to 110, with a higher score representing a healthier diet.  The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) [22] is based on seven components, four components for which the highest intakes are considered to be ideal (vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes) and three components for which avoidance or lowest intake are considered to be ideal (transformed and red meat, sweet beverages and sodium). Each component is given a minimal score of 1 and a maximal score of 5, with intermediate values scored proportionally.",880a540d-23b8-43ce-b09a-bda3d4494bc9
8,methods5," All component scores are summed to obtain a total Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, which ranges from 5 to 40, with a higher score representing a healthier diet.  Transformed Mediterranean Diet Score (tMDS)  [23] is based on 9 components, five components for which higher intakes are considered to be ideal (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, legumes, mono unsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids ratio) and thee components for which lowest intake are considered to be ideal (meat, dairy products and alcohol). Each component is given a minimal score of 0 and a maximal score of 1 according to population’s median components’ consumption. All component scores are summed to obtain a total tMDS score, which ranges from 0 to 9, with a higher score representing a healthier diet.",c7535c6a-fb85-48ff-ab2c-535dd3ba66e1
9,methods6,"  To represent long-term dietary intake and to reduce measurement errors, we calculated the cumulative average of the diet scores over 11-years of exposure period, using the repeated measures of dietary intakes in 1991/1993, 1997/1999 and 2002/2004. To analyse the association of 11 year change in the diet scores with recurrent DepS, scores assessed in 1991/1993 and 2002/2004 were categorized as high or low according to the median value of diet scores in 1991/1993 (58 for AHEI-2010, 24 for Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and 5 for tMDS).",c045d6ed-c4f8-4561-ab2f-8b23d3de3d0d
10,methods7," Four categories were then defined: participants who maintained a high score (both scores of 1991/1993 and 2002/2004 ≥ median score), those who maintained a low score (both scores of 1991/1993 and 2002/2004 < median score), participants who improved their diet score (score of 1991/1993 < median score and score of 2002/2004 < median score) and those who decreased their diet score (score of 1991/1993 ≥ median score and score of 2002/2004 < median score).  Covariates assessed in 2002/2004 Three types of covariates were considered, socio-demographic factors, health behaviours and health status factors and were derived from the questionnaires completed by the participants and from measures assessed during the physical examination in 2002/2004 (measures of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, weight, height, fasting glucose and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol assessed from fasting blood samples taken from participants).",296cb3f1-8ce0-4d3a-9230-c697f9aa933f

Health behaviours included smoking (classified as “current smoker” or “noncurrent smoker” (including former smokers)), alcohol consumption (classified as “no alcohol consumption in the previous week”, “moderate alcohol consumption” (1–14 units/week in women and 1–21 units/week in men), and “heavy drinkers” (15 + units in women and 21 + units in men)), total energy intake (estimated from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) and physical activity (classified as “active” (> 2.",79030965-f02d-461c-8cda-d4b768caaaf8

Adjustments on alcohol consumption were only added for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index since alcohol is part of AHEI-2010 and tMDS scores construction.

28,discussion1,"  Literature on prospective associations between overall diet and depression focuses primarily on the impact of the Mediterranean Diet on incident DepS [13]. Our results on the associations between dietary scores and recurrent DepS further support the relation between a Mediterranean diet and depressive outcomes. This study is, however, the first to show that adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is also associated to recurrent DepS and our results are consistent with existing observational studies showing significant associations between Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and depression [28–30]. The importance of considering the impact of dietary electrolytes on mood disorders points out in these studies, a low-sodium diet seems for instance to be associated with greater fatigue compared with a weight reduction or usual diet [31].",580ccb9d-799c-4afa-8173-f710f0f27bfa
29,discussion2,"  For the AHEI, our previous analyses carried out on Whitehall participants showed that the preceding version of the AHEI was associated with the recurrence of DepS assessed over 5 years [32]. This association was reported in women but not in men. However, this sex-specific association was not explained by baseline covariates and the possibility that the study was underpowered remained plausible. In the present analysis, we assessed for the first time whether the updated criteria of the AHEI—the AHEI-2010—was associated with the recurrence of DepS and we reported a significant and robust association with no sex differences.  All three dietary indices showed some similarities as reflected by the high correlations coefficients between their scores.",02bf3e5d-341a-4f3e-a482-a99e595b74e2
30,discussion3," Despite higher correlation between AHEI-2010 and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) compared to AHEI-2010 and tMDS, analyses of the association between diet scores at baseline and recurrent DepS showed closer estimates of the AHEI-2010 and tMDS z-scores associations with recurrent DepS compared to AHEI-2010 and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) z-scores—recurrent DepS associations. While sharing common components, one explanation might be related to the fact that both tMDS and AHEI-2010 account for the alcohol consumption while the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) did not. Further studies need to quantify the relative importance of alcohol component compared to other components of a diet in regards to depression.  The assessment of the long term adherence to healthy guidelines provided by the three indices and their association with recurrence of DepS constitutes novel findings.",20046859-5417-498f-8225-e97cc9e36c02
31,discussion4," The reasons we observed an association with the AHEI-2010 but not with the two other dietary indices regarding the long term impact of diet on depressive outcomes remains unclear. One possibility might be that the scoring system of most components of the AHEI-2010 is based on fixed cut-off while the scoring method of the tMDS is based on the binary attribution of 0 or 1 point according to population medians of components’ consumption. Another possibility is that the sodium and the trans fatty acids intakes taken into account in the AHEI-20110 score but not in the tMDS play a differential role on the observed associations assessing the long term impact of diet on the recurrence of DepS. Finally, it is also possible that in this specific population, the AHEI-2010 score is more adapted than the tMDS or the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH).",8a444203-6aaf-4d26-971b-9ff3a398236a
32,discussion5," However, at this stage, additional studies are needed to replicate our findings and further identify the most adapted dietary recommendations for each population regarding onset or recurrence of DepS.  Limitations of the present findings include, firstly, the use of a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (covering 127 specific food items) to assess the dietary intakes, since it is considered to be less precise than other dietary assessment methods such as dietary records. Specifically, estimation of sodium intake considered in the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and the AHEI-2010 scores was obtained by nutrient analysis of food intake collected by the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and did not account for salt added during cooking or to prepared food.",88fd809a-753e-48b4-8c3e-7b71e8c091e1
33,discussion6," Nevertheless, nutrient intake estimated by this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) has previously been shown to be well correlated with biomarkers concentrations and intake estimates from generally more accurate 7 day diary [17]. A second limitation of this study is the use of the CES-D to assess DepS. Even though the CES-D scale has been shown to be a reliable and valid measurement tool [33], the repeated measurements of CES-D may not capture the severity or the chronicity of DepS. We sought to take into account this limitation by considering recurrent DepS defined as participants with a CES-D DepS episode at least 2 out of 4 follow-up phases. However, our results cannot be extended to major depression. Another limitation is the bi-directional aspect of the diet depression association. It is hard to conclude to a direction of this association, even with the prospective design of this study.",3548490a-9c87-493e-9cde-6f31cfb067c7
34,discussion7," To take into account this limitation, we conducted sensitivity analysis, excluding participants who have previously been considered depressive. Finally, a third drawback concerns the generability of our findings. As Whitehall II participants consist mainly of white, office-based civil servants, which is not fully representative of the British general population. In addition, some bias owing to selective retention of participants is possible as we found socioeconomic status, number of DepS episodes and in a less extent diet indices scores to be associated with the likelihood of being included in the analyses. If anything, this could contribute to an underestimation of the association between healthy dietary scores and recurrent DepS on the account of the overrepresentation of individuals with no recurrent DepS episode who follow a health-conscious diet.",ca8106e6-80f8-4f53-a316-b1a32f7021f2
35,discussion8,"  Strengths of this study are, first, its large sample size (nearly 5000 participants) allowing us to assess the associations between diet and recurrent DepS considering 658 cases with recurrent DepS. Second the use of three different diet indices that allows to compare different diet styles, applicable on a British population. Third, the prospective design of this study with 13-year follow up on DepS and an 11-year of exposure period for dietary assessment makes possible to study the longitudinal effect of diet on DepS.  In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the association between long-term adherence to dietary guidelines as those provided by the AHEI-2010 and lower risk of future recurrent DepS over adult life. The use of AHEI-2010 was a definite strength, its fixed cut-offs provides some clear dietary guidelines to the clinicians to assess dietary behaviours and provide a good tool for dietary counselling to patients.",e8edd572-4604-4290-974a-63f04f75f504
36,discussion9," Our results add support to the existing evidence suggesting the importance of diet in mental health care [34] and prevention [4]. To go further, the efficiency of dietary improvement intervention based on the AHEI-2010 guidelines on depression outcomes need to be tested.
