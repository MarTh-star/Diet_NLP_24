0,methods0,"2.1. Subjects and Design A non-experimental, cross-sectional and ex post-facto study was carried out with a single measurement in a single group. The sample consisted of 775 university students from the eight provinces of Andalucia (Spain), with a gender representation of 58.7% (n = 455) for men and a 41.3% (n = 320) for women. The mean age was 22.22 ± 3.76 (range: 20 to 29 years old) and the criteria for sample selection was to study the mention of Physical Education in the Degree of Primary Education in any of the eight provinces of Andalucia. The students enrolled in PE degrees in Andalucia were 1167 for the academic year 2016/2017, according to the data provided by the different universities. For this population, 775 students were selected using simple random sampling following the statements established by Merino-Marban et al. [38] for natural groups.  2.2.",1bec19b4-671e-48bb-8489-b8928a63478c
1,methods1," Measures Motivational climate was evaluated through the Perceived Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire (PMCSQ-2, [39]), using the Spanish version validated by González-Cutre et al. [40]. This scale is composed of 33 five-point items ranging from 1 to 5 (1 = Strongly Disagree; 5 = Strongly Agree). This questionnaire is comprised of two dimensions (Task-climate and Ego-climate), each containing three subscales: Cooperative Learning, Effort/Improvement, and Important Role; and Punishment for Mistakes, Unequal Recognition, and Member Rivalry, respectively. For this scale, the internal consistency got an acceptable value of Cronbach’s alpha (α = 0.82).  Alcohol consumption was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), [41]), which was translated to Spanish by Rubio [42]. This 10-item scale is evaluated using a five-point Likert scale where 0 is “Never” and 4 is “Daily” for the first eight items.",cab6e340-e8fd-43b9-8c50-e11d40a02efb
2,methods2," In addition, the last two items are evaluated using a three-point Likert scale which generates a point score of 0, 2 or 4 points. Responses are summed to produce an overall score relating to alcohol consumption. This instrument got an acceptable Cronbach’s alpha of α = 0.75.  Levels of PA were evaluated using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A; [43]), which was translated to Spanish by Martínez-Gómez et al. [44]. This scale is used in order to evaluate the level of practice of PA during the last week. This instrument allows to get a summation from 10 items which are scored through a five-point Likert scale where 0 is “Never” and 4 is “Always”. In the present study, this scale obtained an acceptable Cronbach’s alpha of α = 0.80.  The level of adherence to MD was assessed through The Evaluation of the Mediterranean Diet Index (KIDMED) [45].",9c4261e5-9981-4311-997d-417a8d41a35a
3,methods3," This scale is composed of 16 dichotomous items which can be answered with yes or no (there are 12 positive items and 4 negative items). Finally, these items conform an overall punctuation which lies in the range of −4 to 12. This scale obtained an acceptable internal consistency, showing a Cronbach’s alpha of α = 0.83.  The Spanish adaptation by Villareal-González [46] of The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND, [47]) was employed in order to evaluate tobacco consumption. This instrument evaluates the number or amount of cigarettes, impulse to smoke and nicotine dependency. It includes six questions. The first four are dichotomous (0 = No and 1 = Yes), and the other two follow a four-option Likert-type scale (0 = Never and 3 = Always). The sum of items ranges between 0 and 10, establishing the level of dependence to nicotine. This study got an excellent Cronbach’s alpha of α = 0.96.  The “Meter Shuttle Run Test (20mSRT) [48] was used for measuring the VO2MAX.",55d234de-a109-4dce-ae33-0074bfdb69c3
4,methods4," This test consists of running repeatedly a distance of 20 m with an incremental speed, starting with an initial speed of 8 km/h which increase 0.5 km/h per minute. The VO2MAX is indirectly calculated through the speed achieved in the last period. For this aim, the following formula is used: VO2MAX (mL/min/kg) = (6 × FA) − 27.4 [49,50].  Finally, self-concept was assessed through the Five-Factor Self-Concept Questionnaire (AF-5) [51]. This test includes 30 items which are rated on a five-point Likert scale (1 = Never; 5 = Always). The negative items are inverted and a summation of the score obtained in each one is made in order to obtain a total score for the self-concept. The AF-5 showed an acceptable Cronbach ‘s alpha with a value of α = 0.86.  2.3. Procedure First, the participants’ collaboration was requested using an informative document prepared from the Corporal Area of the University of Granada.",dd30e6fe-0722-49d3-ba09-3d595a5d9681
5,methods5," It was administered to the university students who attended the Mention of Physical Education in the Degree of Primary Education in the eight Andalusian provinces through the departments of the different universities. The nature and objectives of the research to be performed were detailed in this document. Moreover, the informed consent to participate in this investigation was requested.  Second, respondents were instructed for the data collection process. All scales were applied in a normal teaching lesson at the university without providing incentives for that aim. Furthermore, a research assistant was present in order to help those respondents who had any difficulty. It is important to establish that the Ethics Committee of the University of Granada approved this research (462/CEIH/2017). In addition, this study followed the Ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki for medical research.  2.4.",e990a64c-9ff0-4240-a38e-c074a178cfeb
6,methods6," Statistical Analysis Descriptive analysis was carried out using the software SPSS® version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), while the Structural Equation Model (Structural Equation Model (SEM)) was developed through the software AMOS® version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). For theses analysis, the level of significance was set at 0.05 using the Pearson Chi-square test. In addition, the Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient was used to establish the internal reliability of the scales, fixed at 95.5%. The Structural Equation Model (SEM) developed is shown in Figure 1.  The Structural Equation Model shown in Figure 1 is composed of two latent variables (ovals) and 12 observed variables (squares). In addition, each observed variable is associated with an error term (circles). Task Climate (TC) and Ego Climate (EC) represents the latent variables which are exogenous.",e04b730e-38cf-4336-b29e-45d4af228a2f
7,methods7," These two latent variables were inferred by the following six observed variables: Cooperative Learning (CL), Important Role (RI) and Effort/Improvement (EI) for Task Climate (TC), and Unequal Recognition (UR), Member Rivalry (MR) and Punishment for Mistakes (PM) for Ego Climate (EC). Other latent variables were Tobacco consumption (Tobacco consumption (TOB)), adherence to Mediterranean diet (MD), Physical Activity (PA), Alcohol consumption (Alcohol consumption (ALC)), VO2MAX, and Self-Concept (SC), which act as endogenous variables. Furthermore, the unidirectional arrows associate with the observed variables showing the influence between them, while bi-directional arrows relate to the latent variables. It is important to highlight that these arrows can be interpreted as multivariate regression coefficients.",eba80a20-8af5-4769-b6d2-79cec7a0d065
8,methods8,"  Model fit was examined in order to verify the reliability of the Structural Equation Model (SEM) developed through several indices [52] and the method of maximum likelihood (ML) was employed to estimate associations between constructs. Chi-squared analysis show a good fit for non-significant p-values. In addition, other indices are employed such as Normalized Fit Index (Normalized Fit Index (NFI)), Increase Fit Index (Increase Fit Index (IFI)) and Comparative Fit Index (Comparative Fit Index (CFI)). Values higher than 0.90 indicate an acceptable fit, and values higher than 0.95 show an excellent fit. Finally, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)) set an acceptable fit for values below 0.08, and an excellent fit for values below 0.05.  3. Results The indices analyzed for this Structural Equation Model (SEM) suggest a good fit. First, the chi-square showed a significant value (χ2 = 462.83; df = 78; p < 0.001).",b4fa15f3-4334-4297-82ef-a7e2c03b3613
9,methods9," Nevertheless, it is important to establish that this index is really sensitive to sample size, and it is essential to take into consideration other standardized indices [52]. The Normalized Fit Index (NFI) got a value of 0.91, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) showed a value of 0.92 and the Increase Fit Index (IFI) yielded a value of 0.92, showing an acceptable fit for the model. Moreover, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) showed a value of 0.08, revealing an acceptable fit for this index [52]. Thus, these values suggest that the Structural Equation Model (SEM) fits the empirical data properly.  Table 1 and Figure 2 show the regression weights of the structural model for men. Analyzing the motivational climate in sport as an exogenous variable, a negative association was found between task climate and ego climate (p < 0.001; b = −0.37).",10f4221a-0415-4639-91de-e2f6e07a36e6
10,methods10," Furthermore, the three observed variables which define these two latent variables were directly associated with their respective dimension (p < 0.001). The strongest indicator for task climate was an important role (b = 0.88) and for ego climate was unequal recognition (b = 0.93). The indicators with the lowest regression weight were effort/improvement (b = 0.79) and member rivalry (b = 0.62), respectively.  Addressing the relationship between motivational climate and healthy habits, PA was associated with task climate (p < 0.001; b = 0.22) and ego climate (p < 0.01; b = 0.14) in men, showing a positive relationship in both cases. Nevertheless, the MD and tobacco consumption were not related to the dimensions established for motivational climate. In addition, there was a positive relationship between MD and PA (p < 0.001; b = 0.27) and a negative association between MD and tobacco consumption (p < 0.01; b = −0.15).",c5aff591-27cf-42b7-93fa-fdaf0a411dc5
11,methods11,"  Finally, the second level of the model analyzes the relationship between healthy habits and indicators of health status. PA was directly related to VO2MAX (p < 0.05; b = 0.10) and self-concept (p < 0.01; b = 0.14), as well as MD was positively associated with self-concept (p < 0.05; b = 0.08), but not with VO2MAX. Results showed a positive relationship between alcohol and VO2MAX (p < 0.05; b = 0.09). Tobacco consumption was negatively associated with VO2MAX (p < 0.01; b = −0.14) and alcohol consumption was inversely related to self-concept (p < 0.01; b = −0.12). In addition, tobacco consumption was not associated with self-concept.  Table 2 and Figure 3 show the regression weights for women. Analyzing the motivational climate in sport as an exogenous variable, a negative association was found between task climate and ego climate (p < 0.001; b = −0.54).",ec96c04e-1174-45d2-8e63-df9ae9019bca

The indicators with the lowest regression weight were effort/improvement (b = 0.83) and member rivalry (b = 0.52), respectively.  Addressing the relationship between motivational climate and healthy habits, PA was associated with task climate (p < 0.001; b = 0.17) and ego climate (p < 0.01; b = 0.24), showing a positive relationship in both cases. Nevertheless, the MD was not related to the dimensions established for motivational climate. Tobacco consumption showed a negative relationship with task climate (p < 0.001; b = −0.24) and ego climate (p < 0.001; b = −0.26). In addition, there was a positive relationship between MD and PA (p < 0.001; b = 0.23), while MD was not associated with tobacco consumption.",6edab815-5e79-47dc-8597-67adcc66004d
13,methods13,"  Finally, the second level of the model analyzes the relationship between healthy habits and indicators of health status. PA was directly related to VO2MAX (p < 0.001; b = 0.28) but there were no associations with self-concept. On the contrary, MD was directly related to self-concept (p < 0.01; b = 0.17), but not with VO2MAX. Results did not show relationships between alcohol and VO2MAX. Tobacco consumption was directly associated with VO2MAX (p < 0.01; b = 0.15) and alcohol consumption was negatively associated with self-concept (p < 0.01; b = −0.14). In addition, tobacco consumption was directly related to self-concept in women (p = 0.05; b = 0.11).  4. Discussion The present research was conducted with university students of Physical Education given the interest that this sample presents as emerging adults who will train and educate children in the field of health in the future.",e358b22a-244b-46f3-aac7-081e5865b347
14,methods14," The main objective of this research was to develop a structural model that explains the relationship between the motivational climate in sport and healthy habits. Moreover, a second level is added to the model, in which two indicators of the level of physical health (VO2MAX) and mental health (self-concept) appear. This is done in order to check the direct effect of healthy habits on these variables and the negative effect of the motivational climate in them. In addition, a multi-group analysis is developed in order to compare the relationships between these variables according to the gender of the students with the aim to provide a view closer to reality. In this way, some researches of similar line are those developed by Chacón et al. [5], Hardcastle et al. [33], Varela-Mato et al. [53], Ganasegeran et al. [54] and Chacón-Cuberos et al. [55].",f06077f3-6b34-4284-a90c-a6e59de386ab
15,methods15,"  First, it is important to point out that the motivational climate in sport represents the exogenous variable of the structural model, and that it will have an effect on the other endogenous variables (healthy habits). In this way, an inverse association could be observed between the task-oriented climate and the ego-oriented climate, which acquired greater strength for women. Although these findings have been previously demonstrated given the greater tendency of women to position themselves for task-oriented motivational climates [31,56], it should be noted that in this research, a difference was not as pronounced as in others [5,57]. This is due to the fact that both sexes are academically and professionally engaged in sports, so their tendency towards competition is higher and shows elevated values in both ego climates.",f89a74e0-81bc-47fc-92ff-94136665c8b2
16,methods16," A clear example of this is that the most influential indicators for both motivational orientations are the same, although unequal recognition and rivalry between members is higher in men [32,33].  Considering the relationship between motivational climate and different healthy habits, PA was related to both motivational climates, obtaining a greater correlation strength for task climate in men and for ego-oriented climate in women. It could indicate that women practice sport, being motivated by extrinsic goals such as competition or achieving physical attractiveness [29,58], while men pursue more self-determined motivations such as enjoying or learning new skills in sports practice [59]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that in the case of the relationship between task climate and PA in women, the level of significance is set at p < 0.05, which means that statistical differences are shown for relatively low regression weights.",4a313c06-d088-4d96-b618-6dd556dad0d0
17,methods17," Furthermore, MD was not related to the motivational climate for both groups, and this relationship was deleted from the path model. These results are contrary to those obtained by Chacón et al. [5] or Leyton et al. [60]. This may be due to the fact that respondents follow a diet of good quality, since it influences sports performance and all participants are athletes. In spite of this, it has been demonstrated that in non-sporting contexts, the task-oriented motivational climate is linked to a better quality of the diet, since the subjects who are intrinsically motivated will not suffer stress and frustration in the face of sports defeats, which would lead them to make unhealthy meals as a mean to generate satisfaction [5,60]. Likewise, motivational climate was not associated with alcohol and tobacco in men, while tobacco consumption has a negative relationship with both motivational climates in women.",4456c144-bb18-4acf-a1a3-6f909f4489fa
18,methods18," Thus, it could be concluded that the promotion of physical-sport practice could help reduce this type of harmful habit [5,33,53].  Subsequently, the relationships between healthy habits were analysed. According adherence to MD, findings reveal a direct relationship between this variable and the practice of PA, which was higher in women. This could be explained by the greater association found in this sex for the ego-oriented motivational climate, which would imply a greater care of the diet for the improvement of the physical fitness for competition and physical attractiveness [36,61]. In addition, MD was inversely associated with tobacco consumption in men, which could demonstrate that to follow an appropriate diet could help to prevent the consumption of this substance, as shown by Phull et al. [62]. In this line, adherence to MD was positively related to self-concept, especially in women. Zurita-Ortega et al.",b6dc394d-d7ff-4c63-9d05-2b7e6acf7e4f
19,methods19," [63] show how following a healthy diet helps in the improvement of physical and academic self-concept by improving body composition and school performance.  Analysing the second level of the model—the association between healthy habits and indicators of health status—it was found that PA showed a positive and direct relationship with VO2MAX and self-concept. The first relationship should also be interpreted with caution in men, since a low level of significance was obtained for the reasons described above. Nevertheless, the relationship between PA and VO2MAX acquired greater strength in women. It is evident that physical exercise will produce various physiological benefits such as the improvement of cardiac output, the exchange of pulmonary gases or muscle capillarization, which will increase the maximum oxygen consumption [13,19,20]. Moreover, PA will also improve body composition, which will directly affect the physical dimension of self-concept [26,64].",c836c72b-d4d0-46c4-a158-54bdebce4cf0
20,methods20," It should be noted that MD was not related to VO2MAX, which could be justified by the greater dependence of this indicator on sport habits and training intensity parameters. In addition, it has been demonstrated that a high adherence to MD is linked to a better health state, but not with the adaptations linked to a higher VO2MAX such as lung volume or better perfusion of respiratory gases [19,61]. Finally, PA did not reveal statistically significant associations with respect to alcohol consumption. This could be due to the expansion of this substance among young adults [65,66], which means that conclusive results cannot be obtained in this regard.  Analysing the consumption of harmful substances, it should be highlighted that alcohol consumption was not related to VO2MAX in women. Nevertheless, a negative relationship was observed between tobacco consumption and VO2MAX for men as well as a positive association for women.",45a23daa-298c-40d4-8c37-f3190fb0c482
21,methods21," These results may seem contradictory given that tobacco consumption decreases lung function in addition to increasing the risk of suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [67]. Nevertheless, these findings could be justified by the positive effect of the practice of PA in women, decreasing the negative effect of tobacco on VO2MAX. With respect to self-concept, it has been proven that alcohol intake is negatively related to it, since Chacón et al. [66] and Lindgren et al. [68] establish the negative relationship of this substance with its familiar, academic and physical dimensions. In these studies, only positive relationships were found with the social dimension of self-concept. In fact, this premise could justify the direct relationship given between the consumption of tobacco and the self-concept of women in the present research, even though it is a relationship with a low level of significance.  Finally, it is essential to highlight the limitations of this research.",058e0283-d381-4aa5-a558-3af8c240c78f
22,methods22," The first of these lies in the design of the research, since cross-sectional studies do not allow to establish causal relationships. Nevertheless, the structural model developed allows knowing the associations given between the variables in an effective way. Another limitation is related to the values of significance given for p-value. The structural equation model considers three levels of significance (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001). This means that having a high sample, significant relationships are obtained at p < 0.05 for several variables, making them show relatively low regression weights. As a solution, the significance level could be set to p < 0.001 for future studies. Nevertheless, it can be established that the sample size is adequate for the model developed since the method of maximum likelihood in the analysis of covariance is employed.",b99b7a61-acdd-4eaa-bdb7-7c1015f2f61e
23,methods23," In addition, a valid coefficient is obtained for the root Mean Square Error of Approximation and the standard error bias for parameters does not exceed 5% [69]. Finally, the variables used could represent another limitation, since only VO2MAX was used to assess health status. Thus, as future perspectives there is a need to replicate this model in other groups by expanding the sample, as well as the inclusion of other indicators of health, such as the percentage of lean and fat mass or hand grip strength. It would also be interesting to include other psychosocial factors related to these habits and mental health, such as self-esteem or body image.  5. Conclusions As main conclusions, it can be noted that there is a positive association between MD and PA in both genders, being slightly higher in women.",9c5449f0-9903-4b3f-83ba-89203f55b5a4
24,methods24," There is a direct relationship between MD and self-concept, which is higher in women despite the fact that MD is not related to the motivational climate in sport and VO2MAX for men and women. In addition, PA was related to both motivational climates, obtaining a greater correlation strength for the task climate in men and the ego climate in women. Likewise, PA was positively associated with VO2MAX in both sexes and with self-concept in males, showing its beneficial effects. Finally, alcohol was negatively related to self-concept in both sexes, while smoking was positively related to self-concept in women due to social issues. It can be established that following an active lifestyle and good nutrition is related to a better state of physical and mental health. Although the motivational climate was not related to MD, it was associated with PA, which was directly related to the diet followed.",b714ea94-a2a9-49d1-8cee-2c068fe0fad8
25,methods25," Thus, the importance of developing task-oriented motivational climates in order to promote healthier habits and to avoid negative behaviour in university students should be highlighted.
