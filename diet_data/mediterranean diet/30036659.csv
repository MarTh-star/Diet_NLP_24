0,methods0,"2.1. Animals The present study was double-blinded randomized and performed at the Preclinical Imaging Center (Preclinical Imaging Center (PRIME)) of the Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) using 28 male 2–3 months old C57BL/6JRj mice (Harlan Laboratories Inc., Horst, The Netherlands). Before tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)O, the mice had ad libitum access to standard food pellets (Ssniff rm/h V1534-000, Bio Services, Uden, The Netherlands) and autoclaved water and were individually housed in Digital Ventilated Cages (DVC) cages (Digital Ventilated Cage, Tecniplast S.P.A., Buguggiate (VA), Italy) during the experiments to study individual locomotion via calculation of Digital Ventilated Cages (DVC) metric measures (activity, walked distance, walked velocity, total turns, laterality index) during day and night time, before and after surgery [23,24].",5ab46e95-d7a7-4d85-8ce3-373feeaeb64d
1,methods1," The animals were kept on an artificial 12 h light-dark cycle (lights on at 7:00) in rooms controlled for humidity and temperature (21 ± 1 °C) and background music playing during the light cycle. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Dutch federal law for animal experimentation (“Wet op de Dierproeven,” 1996) and the regulations of the European Union Directive of 22 September 2010 (2010/63/EU). All experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the RadboudUMC (protocol number: RU-DEC 2017-0021) and performed according to the ARRIVE guidelines.  2.2. Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o) At ~3 months of age, mice underwent transient (30 min) occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o), as previously described [9]. Mice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane in a 2:1 (air:oxygen) mixture and were kept under anaesthesia for the duration of the surgery.",9a854716-164c-472c-903e-6875f6ef6bcc
2,methods2," Just prior to the occlusion procedure, a Laser Doppler probe (moorVMS-LDF2, Moor Instruments, Axminster, Devon, UK) was placed on the skull of the mice to monitor cerebral blood flow (cerebral blood flow (CBF)) as an assessment of the efficacy of the occlusion (≥ 80% loss of cerebral blood flow (CBF)). A 7-0 monofilament (190–200 μm, coating length 2–3 mm, 70SPRePK5, Doccol Corp., Sharon, MA, USA) was inserted in the right carotid cerebral artery (carotid cerebral artery (CCA)) and pushed upward to the proximal part of the middle cerebral artery (middle cerebral artery (MCA)). The filament occluded the middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 30 min, after which it was retracted to allow reperfusion. As a control, part of the mice underwent sham surgery instead of tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o. In these mice, the filament was immediately retracted after touching the Willis’ circle.",7c757fcc-673a-4936-99d0-60890dd8f912
3,methods3," After surgery, all mice were carefully assessed for pain and other discomfort, weighed every day at 12:00 for seven days, and food intake was monitored. Exclusion criteria were decreased motor activity (<50% of the baseline measurements combined from the baseline values of each behavioral test) or extreme weight loss (>20% within three consecutive days). Using a T2-weighted RARE sequence to measure lesion size and ratio between stroke (right) and unaffected (left) hemispheres, all stroke animals showed a comparable lesion size at seven days post-stroke and no dietary effect on lesion size (data not shown). Notably, both dietary groups demonstrated atrophy over time in a decrease in left-to-right ratio (D7: 0.97 ± 0.03; D35: 0.85 ± 0.08; F(1,12) = 31.3, p < 0.006). The time line of the experimental design is illustrated in Figure 1.  2.3.",7c570441-5cc7-4307-bfef-53b99ac935fe
4,methods4," Group Allocation and Diet After stroke, mice were randomly allocated, using a random sequence generator, to one of two diets: an HT-enriched diet (n = 13; stroke (n = 6), sham (n = 7)) or an isocaloric control diet (n = 15; stroke (n = 8), sham (n = 7)). Group sizes were calculated according to effect sizes (p = 0.05, statistical power: 0.80), exclusion, and mortality rates previously determined by a similar study of our group [9]. Both diets contained 24.0% kcal protein, 15.0% kcal fat, and 61.0% kcal carbohydrates (Research Diet Services B.V., Wijk bij Duurstede, The Netherlands), and their detailed composition is described elsewhere [25,26,27]. The HT-enriched diet was supplied with 0.03% HT (Seprox Biotech, Murcia, Spain) incorporated into the pellets, resulting in approximately 45 mg HT/kg bw/day (human equivalent dose of 3.6 mg HT/kg bw/day). Food intake and body weight was measured before and during the weeks after surgery. Excluded mice per test are shown in Table S1.  2.4.",37e1b428-0ec4-46ff-b369-00d1f6c3c13e
5,methods5," Open Field Mice were placed in a square open field (45 × 45 × 30 cm) for 10 min to assess locomotion and explorative behavior. The open field test was performed three times: once prior to surgery, and at three and 21 days post-surgery. Locomotion was automatically recorded, using EthoVision XT 10.1 (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands). In EthoVision, the floor of the open field arena was divided in zones to distinguish the periphery, corners, and center. The frequency of entering these zones was automatically recorded. Additionally, manual scoring of exploratory behaviors (sitting, walking, grooming, wall-leaning, rearing) was performed, as previously described [28].  2.5. Grip Test Grip strength of the mice was measured with a grip strength meter (Grip Strength Meter, 47200, Ugo Basile, Italy) at three time points: pre-stroke and day 15 and day 29 (post-stroke).",b5031d39-4cbc-4a1f-8c84-61b294b66c79
6,methods6," Mice were held by their tail so they could grab a trapeze or grid (connected to the grip strength meter) to measure, respectively, muscle strength in the fore limbs (trapeze) or strength in all four limbs collectively (grid). Trials in which mice grabbed the trapeze with only one forepaw or the grid with less than four paws were excluded. Additionally, trials in which the mouse grabbed the side of the trapeze were also excluded. The maximum value of peak force (in gram per force (gf)) was averaged per experimental group for both trapeze and grid.  2.6. Pole Test The pole test is used to monitor motor function. It was performed pre-stroke and post-stroke at day 14 and day 28. The mouse was placed on a vertical pole with its head pointed upward and had to turn 180 degrees to walk down the pole. The time needed to fully turn 180 degrees (turning time) and the turning direction were manually recorded.",de6a5059-758e-4ff7-a83c-c38985f6e6c9
7,methods7," Additionally, video recordings of each trial were automatically analyzed with EthoVision XT 10.1 (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands) to calculate the velocity (cm/s) with which the mouse walked down the pole. Trials that were excluded from statistical analysis consisted of every first trial of a mouse (acclimatization), trials in which the mouse was already turning when placed on the pole, and trials in which the mouse showed no motivation and was assisted by the researcher to go down.  2.7. Rotarod As a measure of balance, coordination, physical condition and motor planning the Rotarod (ITC LifeScience Inc., Woodland Hills, CA, USA) was performed pre-surgery and at day 10 and day 21 post-surgery. The mice were placed on the Rotarod and left to acclimatize for 10–30 s. Then, the Rotarod was turned on to accelerate for 300 s from 4 to 40 rpm. The latency time to fall was recorded. No significant effects (data not shown) were found.  2.8.",2c0f8908-1599-48e3-803a-3fc546a425ef
8,methods8," Prepulse Inhibition (Ppi) The Prepulse inhibition (Ppi) test was performed 16 days post-stroke to examine the sensorimotor gating integration of the mice, as previously described [29]. To measure the startle reactivity, the mouse was placed in a restrainer in the chamber of the SR-LAB startle response system (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA) and exposed to blocks of startle pulses. Pre-pulse inhibition was calculated during the second block of startle pulses as 100 - response to startle pulse after pre-pulse/response to startle pulse × 100%. Additionally, habituation to startle pulses was investigated by comparing the startle response to the first startle pulse block to the startle response in the third (last) startle pulse block.  2.9. Morris Water Maze (Morris Water Maze (MWM)) The Morris water maze (Morris Water Maze (MWM)) was used to test spatial learning and memory in rodents.",c9954157-ffd8-4f12-b1ba-459bc852234b
9,methods9," In short, before surgery, all mice were placed in a circular pool, filled with opaque water, and were trained to find a submerged platform in the northeast (NE) quadrant of the pool by using distant visual cues. At the end of the fourth day, mice additionally performed a single probe trial, in which the platform was removed from the swimming pool. Mice were allowed to swim for 120 s, and the time spent swimming and searching in the NE quadrant (where the platform had been located) was recorded. The Morris Water Maze (MWM) is used to analyze spatial learning and memory before surgery (data not shown). All mice learned to find the hidden platform revealed by a decrease in latency time from acquisition day 1 to day 4 (−16.33s ± 5.68s; F (3,81) = 3.8, p < 0.013).  2.10. Novel Object Recognition Test (Object Recognition Test (ORT)) Short-term memory of the mice was measured with the novel object recognition test (Object Recognition Test (ORT)), as previously described [9].",ecfd48c1-c6aa-4e7c-9e18-abd07de9fa49
10,methods10," This test spanned three days. On the first day, mice were acclimatized to the open field box by letting them explore freely for 10min. On the second and third day, mice underwent object recognition trials. First, mice performed a familiarization trial. In this trial two identical objects (eggs, tea light holders, yellow plastic ice cream cones, or bottles filled with sand) (F1 and F2) were placed in the open field, equidistant from the center, and the mouse was then placed in the open field to freely explore the objects for 4 min. After a certain delay (30 min on day 2 and 60 min on day 3), the trial was repeated, with one of the familiar objects (F3) and one object replaced for a novel object (N1). Exploratory behavior of the mice was measured using EthoVision XT 10.1 (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands) as direct contact with the object, or movement within a 2cm diameter around the object.",64090169-01b9-451e-8e8d-1758ca082b86
11,methods11,"  To measure object recognition, several indexes were calculated in both the familiarization and the test phase. In the test phase, discrimination between objects was calculated with the discrimination index (DI), as the time spend around N1 minus F3, divided by the time spend around both objects (DI = (N1 − F3)/(N1 + F3)). From this index, a number between +1 and −1 is obtained, where closer to +1 shows more time spend around N1, closer to −1 more time spend around F3, and 0 shows no difference in time spend at either object. To measure recognition memory, the recognition index (RI) was calculated as the time spend around N1 as a fraction of the time spend around both objects (RI = N1/ (N1 + F3)). The preference for either object was calculated with the preference index (PI), as time the mouse spend around N1 (or F3) as a percentage of the time spend around both objects (PI = 100 × ([N1 or F3]/(N1 + F3)).",0975525f-753f-40ec-8f17-7849a66e6a75
12,methods12," If N1 is the numerator, closer to 100% indicates preference for N1, 50% indicates no preference, and below 50% preference for F3 (vice versa if F3 is the numerator) [30].  2.11. Digital Ventilated Cages (Digital Ventilated Cages (DVC)) As previously described [23,24], animals were single housed in Digital Ventilated Cages (DVC) cages during the experiment to study individual locomotion via calculation of Digital Ventilated Cages (DVC) metric measures (activity, walked distance, walked velocity, total turns, laterality index) during day and night time before and after surgery. A detailed explanation of the calculations on the aforementioned Digital Ventilated Cages (DVC) metric measures can be found in the Supplementary Materials (Figure S1). For analysis of the processed results, we compared week 1–5 individually to pre-surgery values.  2.12.",0d232e54-4a9e-4045-8042-19c1a93a38b7
13,methods13," In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements were performed seven and 35 days after surgery with an 11.7T BioSpec Avance III small animal MR system (Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) operating on Paravision 6.0.1. software (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) under full isoflurane anaesthesia (3.5% for induction and 1.8% for maintenance; in a 2:1 (medical air:oxygen) mixture). Body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe, and maintained at 37 °C using hot air flow. A pneumatic cushion respiratory monitoring system (Small Animal Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, New York, NY, USA) was used to measure the respiration rate of the mouse. Mice with scans that showed motion and/or echo planar imaging artifacts were excluded from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis.  2.13.",5047585a-6972-41f4-bf55-d893f6cf3114
14,methods14," Arterial Spin Labelling (Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL)) To assess cerebral blood flow (cerebral blood flow (CBF)), perfusion imaging was performed using a flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery arterial (flow sensitive alternating inversion recovery arterial (FAIR)) technique as previously described [5,9]. Hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus, according to the Paxinos and Franklin atlas [31], were analyzed as regions of interest (regions of interest (ROI)) by a researcher blinded to the surgery and treatment groups. For each regions of interest (ROI), cerebral blood flow (CBF) was analyzed in the affected (ipsilateral/right) and unaffected (contralateral/left) hemisphere separately for each group.  2.14. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)) Diffusion of water was imaged as described previously [32,33,34]. In short, 22 axial slices covering the whole brain were acquired with a four-shot SE-EPI protocol.",32e3db7a-b9f1-49e6-8dc4-d1c49408c37e
15,methods15," B0 shift compensation, navigator echoes, and an automatic correction algorithm to limit the occurrence of ghosts and artefacts were implemented. Encoding b-factors of 0 s/mm2 (b0 images; 5×) and 1000 s/mm2 were used, and diffusion-sensitizing gradients were applied along 30 non-collinear directions in three-dimensional space. The diffusion tensor was estimated for every voxel using the PATCH algorithm [35]. Mean water diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were derived from the tensor estimation following a protocol as described elsewhere [34]. MD and FA values were measured in several white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) areas, manually selected based on an anatomical atlas [36].  2.15.",db4253f3-3ba6-45fc-84fe-5759af9b1d29
16,methods16," Resting State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (rs-fMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)) Subsequently after the acquisition of the anatomical reference images, resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rsfMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)) datasets were acquired using a single-shot spin-echo sequence with echo-planar readout (SE-EPI) sequence. Six hundred repetitions with a repetition time (TR) of 1.8 s and echo time of 16.9 ms were recorded for a total acquisition time of 18 min. The rsfMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets were first realigned using a least-squares method and rigid-body transformation with Statistical Parametric Mapping (Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)) mouse toolbox (Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)5, University College London; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/; Sawiak et al., 2009).",6bb5cbaa-16a7-4dcc-9113-b064c858a1de
17,methods17," Mean and maximum displacement across the six degrees of freedom (along the x-, y-, and z-axes and on three rotation parameters pitch, roll, and yaw) were measured in each mouse. The mean SE-EPI images for each mouse were then used to generate a study-specific template through linear affine and nonlinear diffeomorphic transformation (ANTs. v1.9; http://picsl.upenn.edu/ANTS/). Visual inspection of the normalized dataset was performed to screen for possible normalization biases. On the template, 12 areas were selected in left and right hemisphere. The selected regions were based on previous work concerning functional connectivity in mice [37] and included left and right dorsal hippocampus, left and right ventral hippocampus, left and right auditory cortex, left and right motor cortex, left and right somatosensory cortex, and left and right visual cortex.",1cd18573-6ac0-4205-9ed9-3117568620f5
18,methods18," All cortical regions of interest (ROI)s were selected 1–2 voxels away from the edge of the cortex to minimize the impact of susceptibility artefacts, which are more prominent in areas close to tissue interfaces (e.g., near the skull or near the ear canals). In-plane spatial smoothing (0.4 × 0.4 mm), linear detrending, and temporal high-pass filtering (cut-off at 0.01 Hz) were applied to compensate for small across-mouse misregistration and temporal low-frequency noise. Functional connectivity (FC) group comparison between regions of interest (ROI)s were calculated from the BOLD time series using total correlation analyses implemented in FSLNets (FSLNets v0.3; www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Pearson’s correlation values were Fisher transformed to Z-scores for group comparisons and statistical analysis.  2.16. qPCR RNA was isolated from frontal parts (divided in to left and right) of the brain (bregma: −0.10 to 4.28 using TRIzol method (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).",70151936-7fe8-4cae-ba6b-154e2e0fc7b1
19,methods19," The samples were treated with RNase-free DNase I (RQ1, Promega, Fitchburg, MA, USA) to eliminate any genomic DNA. cDNA was synthesized using the iScript kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). qPCR was done in 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific) using a StepOnePlus system (Thermo Scientific). Gene expression of postsynaptic density protein 95 (Psd-95), brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) were quantitatively assessed by using hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (Hprt) and beta-2 microglobulin (B2m) as the normalizing genes. The sequences of primers are shown in Table S2.  2.17. (Immuno)histochemistry After the last scanning session, the mice were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion using 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The brains were harvested and stored separately.",0593c1c5-bcbb-402a-b5ce-64b8dbb761f8
20,methods20," The brains were postfixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and transferred to 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.01% sodium azide the next day. One part of the brain (bregma: −0.1 to −4.36) was cut in 30 μm frontal sections using a sliding microtome (Microm HC 440, Walldorf, Germany) equipped with an object table for freeze-sectioning at −60 °C. Then, 24 h before cutting, the brains were transferred to 30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Eight series were cut and stored in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.01% sodium azide so multiple immunohistochemical stainings could be performed.  All sections were stained in one session to minimize differences in staining intensity.",1e1126c0-091b-49d4-b685-9f0491e46518
21,methods21," In total three stainings were performed for vascular integrity measured via glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1), for activated microglia via ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1) as indicator for neuroinflammation, and for immature neurons (measure for neurogenesis) with antibodies against doublecortin (doublecortin (DCX)) on free-floating brain sections on shaker tables at room temperature. Immunohistochemistry was performed using standard free-floating labelling procedures, using previously described protocols [38]. The GLUT-1 amount was visualized using polyclonal rabbit anti-GLUT-1 antibody (1:40,000, Chemicon AB 1340, Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA, USA) and as secondary antibody donkey anti-rabbit biotin (1:1500 Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA).",32e5bc95-2f74-4bb1-826e-0bb948c65d3e
22,methods22," For IBA-1, as primary antibody against IBA-1 polyclonal goat anti-IBA-1 (1:3000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and for doublecortin (DCX), polyclonal goat anti-doublecortin (DCX) (1:8000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was used as a primary antibody to assess neurogenesis. For both, donkey anti-goat biotin (1:1500; Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as a secondary antibody. A more frontal part of the brain tissue (bregma: −0.10 to 0.98) was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and embedded in paraffin according to a standard protocol.  2.18. Quantification (GLUT-1, IBA-1, and doublecortin (DCX)) Brain sections (bregma: −1.46 to −2.30) were preselected for quantification accordingly to the atlas of Franklin and Paxinos [31]. Quantification was done on images taken with a 5× objective using an Axio Imager A2 (Zeiss Germany).",aa415af0-4820-4cff-9c19-ad3e1030bbe1
23,methods23," ImageJ (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to analyze the regions of interest (GLUT-1 + IBA-1: Cortex (bregma 0.62 & −1.94), hippocampus, thalamus, caudate putamen, and corpus callosum (only IBA-1); doublecortin (DCX): Hippocampus).  2.19. Determination of Serum NO Level Nitric oxide production was indirectly quantified by determining nitrate/nitrite and S-nitroso compounds (NOx), using an ozone chemiluminescence-based assay adapted to serum samples [39,40]. In brief, serum samples were deproteinized with 0.8 N NaOH and 16% ZnSO4 solutions (1/0.5/0.5). After centrifugation at 10,000× g for 5 min, the resulting supernatants were removed for chemiluminescence analysis [41] in an NO analyzer (NOA 280i; Sievers Instruments, Boulder, CO, USA). NOx concentration was calculated by comparison with standard solutions of sodium nitrate. Final NOx values were expressed as µM.  2.20.",2289219e-b171-45dc-807f-5388b8b8b7a6
24,methods24," Determination of Serum Oxidative Stress Level Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)), a major indicator of oxidative stress, was determined using an adaptation of the method described by Buege and Aust [42]. Specifically, 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate was added (1:1) to each serum sample. Samples were vortexed and mixed (1:6) with a reagent containing 15% trichloroacetic acid, 0.38% thiobarbituric acid, and 2% HCl and then heated for 30 min at 96 °C, cooled, and centrifuged (3000× g for 5 min). The supernatants were collected, and the absorbance was measured at 532 nm. The concentration of Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was determined by extrapolation from a malondialdehyde standard curve. Results were expressed as µM.  2.21. Statistical Analyses A random and blinded selection procedure was maintained throughout the study.",b9628e51-42f7-4640-a0cd-b4ef0327d1b2
25,methods25," Group means were compared using univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing with a statistical program, SPSS 24 (IBM SPSS Statistics 24, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Nonparametric tests were used when assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were not met. p-values lower than 0.05 were considered significant. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.  3. Results 3.1. Food Intake and Body Weight Food intake and body weight was measured before and during the weeks after surgery (Figure 2). Body weight (Figure 2A) of sham mice did not decrease over time comparing pre-surgery with the first week after surgery (F(1,12) = 3.3, p < 0.095), while body weight of both dietary stroke groups decreased post-stroke versus pre-stroke (F(1,12) = 18.2, p < 0.002). Food intake (Figure 2B) of both stroke and sham mice decreased over time comparing pre-surgery with the first week after surgery (Stroke: F(1,12) = 19.8, p < 0.001; Sham: F(1,12) = 40.",c1fabfce-b2fb-4683-afbc-3851ec6e108c
26,methods26,"5, p < 0.001).  Investigating the development of body weight and food intake over time, these parameters were analyzed weekly after surgery. Sham mice showed a significant time interaction in body weight (F(1,48) = 14.5, p < 0.001) and also in food intake (F(1,48) = 16.5, p < 0.001). In detail, sham mice lost body weight comparing week 1 with week 2 (p < 0.001), while this effect was not present in the upcoming weeks comparing week 2 with week 3, week 3 with week 4, and week 4 with week 5. Sham mice had a lowered food intake comparing week 1 to week 2 (p < 0.006) and also week 3 to week 4 (p < 0.009). Notably, sham mice on HT diet had a higher food intake during all post-surgery weeks than sham mice on control diet (F(1,12) = 5.3, p < 0.041). Stroke mice demonstrated a time interaction in food intake (F(1,48) = 10.2, p < 0.001). After further statistical analysis, stroke mice ate less comparing week 1 with week 2 (p < 0.025) and started to eat more comparing week 2 with 3 (p < 0.008).",13e4274e-2bee-437c-a3df-2ecd25c3b728
27,methods30," Grip Test Forelimb strength of the mice was quantified with a grip test by letting the mice grip a small trapeze connected to a grip strength meter (Figure 5). Fore- and hind-limb strength was determined in a similar fashion, using a grid instead of a trapeze. At week 2, only sham mice showed a lower grip strength on the grid compared to pre-surgery (F (1,12) = 13.0, p < 0.004) (Figure 5A). Stroke mice showed no significant decrease in grip strength on either the trapeze or grid 2 weeks after stroke compared to baseline. A surgery effect was observed at week 2, shown by weaker grip strength in forelimbs in stroke-control mice compared to sham-control mice (F (1,9) = 17.3, p < 0.002) (Figure 5A). At four weeks post-surgery, sham mice show a decreased forelimb grip strength compared to two weeks post-surgery (F(1,10) = 26.0, p < 0.001) (Figure 5A).",775f8966-7f1b-4845-b251-552da223898c
28,methods31," Interestingly, HT-fed stroke mice demonstrated a higher grip strength on the trapeze at weeks 2 and 4 compared to stroke control–diet mice (F (1,12) = 497.0, p < 0.018). No diet effects were observed on the grid (Figure 5B).  3.2.3. Pole Test The pole test was performed to assess motor dysfunction. The time needed to make a full 180 degree turn on the pole and the turning direction was manually scored, and the velocity with which the mice walked down the pole was calculated. There was no change in velocity between baseline measurement and the first measurement after surgery (at 14 days). At 28 days post-surgery, sham mice (F (1,12) = 21.4, p < 0.001) and stroke mice (F(1,9) = 5.2, p < 0.049) walked down the pole with a lower velocity compared to 14 days post-surgery (Figure 6). Neither time nor diet effects on turning side preference or turning time were observed.  3.2.4. Prepulse Inhibition (Ppi) The pre-pulse inhibition test was performed to assess sensorimotor gating after stroke.",c6b5bf06-774f-426a-8d7b-a6914ed22d67

HT mice showed a higher startle amplitude to the basal and final startle stimulus of 120 dB than control mice (F (1,22) = 8.3, p < 0.009) (Figure 7).  3.2.5. Novel Object Recognition Test (Object Recognition Test (ORT)) The object recognition task (Object Recognition Test (ORT)) was performed once after stroke to measure short-term memory of the mice. In the 30 min trials of the familiarization phase, all discrimination index (DI), recognition index (RI), and preference index (PI) showed that stroke animals have a preference for object 2 and sham animals a preference for object 1, as they visited it more frequently (F(1,22) = 5.7, p < 0.026). However, in stroke animals, this effect was largely caused by mice on control diet, as they only showed as PI above 50% (Figure 8).",f38a4acd-f758-4934-8dbb-6f4483dea80b

No diet effects were found on Digital Ventilated Cages (DVC) metrics.  Activity Pre-surgery to Post-surgery Week 1  No effects of both types of surgery (stroke and sham) were found on daytime activity.  During the night time, only stroke mice were less active after surgery over time (F(1,12) = 5.3, p < 0.040).

NO production was quantified indirectly by the determination of nitrates/nitrites using an ozone chemiluminescence–based assay. A reduction in NO levels was detected in stroke animals with no evident diet effect (F(1,23) = 12.6, p < 0.002). Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels were also indirectly quantified by analyzing the level of lipid peroxidation. No changes were detected.  3.4.5.

Discussion Although ischemic stroke is one of the main causes of death and disability worldwide, the only medical treatment for this disease is reperfusion by using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or by endovascular thrombectomy with medical devices. However, the risk of hemorrhage and the narrow therapeutic window make it urgent to find other treatment options focused not only on reperfusion but on neuroprotection as well. In this sense, it has been previously described that olive oil and an olive leaf extract exert a neuroprotective effect in ischemic rats [12,43]. Oleuropein, another polyphenol from olive oil and a precursor of HT, has also been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia [44].",cdd6969b-ae26-48c5-9532-8a346d0edad5
38,methods48," However, a comprehensive analysis of the effect of HT as a therapeutic approach in an in vivo stroke model is lacking. The HT concentration in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is highly variable but can reach over 74.3 mg/kg [45]. It should be noted that these values do not take into account the HT available from oleuropein and oleuropein-aglycone. Therefore, the total exposure to HT may be estimated to be six times higher than the exposure to only free HT [46]. A daily intake of 50 mL of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) will mean an consumption of about 20 mg HT/day from this source [11]. Furthermore, this dose can be safely supplemented due to its very low toxicity [47].",3489dbbd-6b4c-40a4-a6d5-aafc8fe7312f
39,methods49," In this context, the present study shows that an HT-enriched diet with a nutraceutical relevant dose of HT [25,26,27] could be used as a therapeutic approach in stroke recovery by improving (i) learning, short term memory, and grip strength; (ii) cerebral blood flow (CBF) and FC; and (iii) different parameters related to neurogenesis and neuroinflammation.  Motor functions, behavior, and cognition are severely affected after focal ischemia and decisive in the quality of life of stroke patients [48,49]. In our previous study, we described that a multicomponent diet, Fortasyn, improved grip strength in male mice [9]. In the current study, we show that HT improved grip strength on the trapeze, highlighting the potential restorative effect of this single dietary compound on motor network connections. Exploring the HT effects on behavior and motor skills, no diet effects were detected in the open field, Digital Ventilated Cages (DVC), nor the pole tests.",045e0a2c-eeeb-47ba-9b51-28b670757c5d
40,methods50," Notably, in this study, Digital Ventilated Cages (DVC) were used for the first time to study individual mouse locomotion via calculation of Digital Ventilated Cages (DVC) metric measures (activity, walked distance, walked velocity, total turns, laterality index) during the day and night time before and after surgery. This novel approach helped to reveal decreased nighttime activity in stroke mice one week after surgery. Notably, during the nighttime of the second post-surgery week, only stroke mice showed a left turning preference. This latter result is in line with standard behavioral tests like the corner test used in preclinical stroke studies [48,50]. Short-term memory of mice was also evaluated with the novel object recognition test (Object Recognition Test (ORT)). Here, mice on HT diet visited the novel object more frequently than mice on the control diet.",e14425c0-f9f2-4137-b6ac-fd816fe9f986
41,methods51," Similarly, in the PPI test, HT-fed mice showed a higher startle amplitude to the basal and final startle stimulus of 120 dB control mice. Altogether, the Object Recognition Test (ORT) and PPI results suggest that HT improves short-term memory and promotes non-associative learning processes such as habituation, being a promising approach to reduce stroke-associated cognitive deficits.  Moreover, with rsfMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) alterations in neuronal functional architecture, both in animal models and in humans, has been found after ischemic stroke [51]. In a human study, it was demonstrated that the alteration of sensorimotor function after a stroke correlated with a loss of interhemispheric connectivity between sensory-motor regions, and that this disruption normalized partially weeks after the infarction [52]. Thus, in patients with stroke, changes in neuronal activity are closely associated with functional recovery.",2c015325-69a9-43de-b35c-87b470df3574
42,methods52," The increase in rsfMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) activity in the supplementary motor cortex, the lateral premotor cortex and the superior parietal cortex in the first 14 days after infarction correlates with an improvement in motor function of the upper extremities during this period [53]. In the present study, we also investigated brain diffusivity with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) as an imaging biomarker for white and grey matter (GM) integrity. Here, we revealed only impaired GM microstructure in the stroke mice on control diet measured by a decreased FA accompanied by an increased MD at seven days post-stroke in the right hippocampus and right motor cortex compared to their corresponding left counterpart. This effect was not visible in stroke mice on the HT diet, which is in line with our previous study in which a multicomponent diet improved functional and structural connectivity after stroke [9].",b09842d4-ea75-4632-aa13-635ca0ca84f7
43,methods53,"  In our study, the HT diet improved functional and structural connectivity between several cerebral regions in the stroke animals. We suggest that these improvements in connectivity could be related to the increase in the grip strength of the HT-fed mice as well as with their higher habituation and improved short-term memory described above and on the up-regulation of different neurogenic markers that will be discussed later.  cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations are also clinically associated with cognitive and motor dysfunction, especially after stroke [54]. In fact, we already described that a post-stroke diet intervention can improve cerebral blood flow (CBF) [9,55]. Other phenolic compounds such as resveratrol have shown to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the frontal cortex of healthy humans after a task performance [56]. Moreover, in a rat ischemic model, resveratrol increased hippocampal cerebral blood flow (CBF) [57].",5e6c2d9a-6597-4241-aee4-4e4ba94c424e
44,methods54," Our results show that an acute therapeutic approach with an HT diet was able to significantly increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the right hippocampus of all mice on HT diet, and to mitigate the decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the left hippocampus stroke-control mice. Additionally, in the left cortex, the HT diet also increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) after stroke. The positive effect of HT on this parameter probably underlies the improvement in short-term memory and learning processes described above.  cerebral blood flow (CBF) is linked to a balanced production of NO. The particular effect of NO varies depending on the stage of evolution along the ischemic process and on the cellular source of NO [58,59]. Of the three NO synthase (NOS) isoforms responsible for NO production, the activity of neuronal NO synthase (NOS) and inducible NO synthase (NOS) results are detrimental while endothelial NO synthase (NOS) activation is related with neuroprotective effects.",4996a743-5bc8-451f-9948-f29269c87ef6
45,methods55," We have previously shown in stroke patients that an initial elevation of NO favors neurological recovery while a latter elevation predicts growth of the infarct volume [60]. In the present study, we have observed a significant decrease in serum NO concentration in stroke animals. This decrease has also been reported by us and by other research groups and may be attributed to the low profile of L-arginine, the NO precursor, in stroke patients [60,61,62].  A burst in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) follows the stroke insult damaging cellular macromolecules and leading to cell death and tissue loss [63]. HT has been consistently described as an antioxidant compound in several models [64]. Therefore, we evaluated if the HT diet was able to modulate the oxidative level in serum samples obtained from mice after sacrifice.",92180e49-0601-45d6-b20f-2a0bbe18f4aa
46,methods56," The fact that no changes were detected in any experimental group, not even between sham and stroke animals, seems to indicate that 35 days after surgery may be too late to detect changes in serum Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels. In fact, in a previous study with hypoxic mice we observed that Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) brain levels begin to normalize two hours after the insult [65]. As previously mentioned, further analysis with more animals should be carried out, both in serum and in brain samples, and at time-points closer to surgery to re-evaluate the temporal profile of NO production and the particular isoenzymes of NO synthase (NOS) modulated by HT and to analyze the antioxidant capacity of an HT diet after stroke.  HT has shown its anti-inflammatory capacity in different models [66,67,68], although its particular effect on microglia-mediated neuroinflammation remained unexplored.",1ebcc4fc-2322-4eeb-9d4f-0212d05111d8
47,methods57," Other phenolic compounds such as oleuropein have been shown to attenuate microglia activation [69]. The decreased level of IBA-1 immunoreactivity 35 days after stroke in the cortex and corpus callosum of mice on the HT diet corroborates that HT can also reduce the inflammatory environment after stroke. This effect is probably involved in the improved impairments of stroke mice on an HT diet and points to the interest of carrying out future experiments to deepen the investigation into the activity of HT on neuroinflammation.  Neurogenesis is an important process in stroke recovery and a number of therapeutic strategies to promote this process after ischemic events have been investigated with poor outcomes [70]. Stroke insult also involves synaptic degradation which dampens the activity of the CNS. Bdnf is a neurotrophin that regulates synaptic connections, synapse structure, neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity [71].",3cd67d1c-3ded-46d7-93c1-ab7a610496cc
48,methods58," Moreover, Bdnf is required for the induction of neurogenesis and lack of this protein can lead to a lack of neurogenic response in a heterozygous knockout mice model [72]. Additionally, the postsynaptic protein Psd95 is also involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and synaptogenesis. Previous studies demonstrate that the administration of olive leaf or oil polyphenol extracts increases Bdnf levels in the olfactory lobes and hippocampus [73,74]. The synaptogenic potential of HT has been also reported in prenatally stressed rats in which HT prevented the stress-induced downregulation of Bdnf [75]. In accordance, in our study the expression of Psd95 was significantly induced in all HT-fed mice. Unfortunately, no diet effect was found on amount of doublecortin (DCX)+ cells. However, the HT diet only induced Bdnf expression in stroke HT-mice, suggesting a difference in the response between Bdnf and doublecortin (DCX) [76].",a94ca81e-a8af-437f-9157-b681344ff6be
49,methods59," Although further analyses at the protein level are necessary, it is remarkable that HT, a single compound, exhibits these promising effects.  5. Conclusions The data presented here indicate that a post-stroke intervention with a HT-enriched diet favor the recovery after ischemic stroke by ameliorating stroke-associated learning and motor impairments. This effect, probably linked to an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF), functional and structural connectivity, and to its anti-inflammatory and neurogenic potential, makes HT an interesting and safe compound to be further tested in ischemic stroke treatment.
