0,methods0,"The study was offered to local (Auckland, New Zealand) breast cancer survivors of any ethnicity. A six-month, three-arm, parallel-randomised control trial with baseline testing and post-intervention testing was conducted. Specifically, it focused on the effects that dietary changes bring to the body in terms of weight, waist circumference, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), and blood lipid and glucose profiles. The study also explored the effects that nutrition education had on the uptake of dietary changes and the outcome results.  2.1. Participants Trial participants were post-menopausal women aged 50 years and over who had previously been diagnosed and treated for stage 1–3 breast cancer, confirmed by individual medical data. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. The study was approved by the Health and Disability Ethics Committee, New Zealand, reference, 15/STH/184/AM01.",0720ade6-f53f-4bee-b513-a55893678c13
1,methods1," Participants were eligible for the trial if they were three or more months following active treatment (chemotherapy and surgery), were no more than 3 years after active and hormone treatment, and had a body mass index (BMI) > 25. Present or past hormonal therapy was not an exclusion criterion. The participants were excluded from the trial if they were on anti-inflammatory medication, drank more than two standard alcoholic beverages per day, smoked tobacco, or were diagnosed with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.   Potential participants (180) contacted the research team for information. Of these, 75 showed further interest, with 25 of these excluded on the basis of being too young, having advanced stage cancer, or unable to attend the education sessions. Fifty were recruited and completed baseline testing.  2.2. Dietary Arms Participants were randomly block allocated to one of three sets.",ec25a476-30a2-4e65-bdca-188225dc01c6
2,methods2," Set 1 was deemed Arm 1: the MD, set 2 was titled Arm 2: the healthy, low-fat diet (LF), and set 3 became Arm 3: the no-treatment control. Consequently, 17 participants were assigned to Arm 1, 16 to Arm 2, and 17 to Arm 3.  Diets were ad libitum. The MD arm were provided with olive leaf extract to trial; while the LF arm were provided complimentary rice bran oil. The MD diet was based on the main dietary principles of the Mediterranean region and consisted of increasing the intake of olive oil, vegetables, fruit, legumes, fish, nuts, onions, leeks, tomatoes, and garlic while limiting the intake of red meat, butter, margarine, cream, carbonated drinks and sweets, chocolate and baking. The LF diet was based on the New Zealand Ministry of Health Eating and Activity Guidelines for Adults [6].  2.3. Intervention Education Sessions Dietary Arms 1 and 2 each received six group nutrition and lifestyle education sessions from the same educator.",2933ccfd-3bf8-4ff9-8333-4e5916cf71ec
3,methods3," The no-treatment control group did not receive any dietary guidance or intervention over the course of the study. Education sessions occurred once monthly, with a summary newsletter sent two weeks thereafter. Attendance to the scheduled group education sessions was monitored via roll call at each session. Each intervention group received a total of six education sessions and six newsletters. The education topics are outlined here, numbered according to education session:Introduction to group members, the assigned diet, and the concept of lifestyle change including dietary, activity, and social aspects  Discussion of barriers to achieving dietary, activity, and lifestyle goals,",7bd533cb-8cc4-408b-a41d-02b558ac37f6
4,methods4," and how the environment can affect weight and lifestyle choices  Practical exercise on calorie definition and estimating portion sizes including education on completing food diaries  Discussion around stress management and fatigue in terms of eating  Practical exercise in correctly reading food labels  Introduction of weight loss tips to the participants  Discussion of tips for shopping successfully to maintain new dietary habits  Session was conducted via email to save participant travel. It involved a recap of the assigned diet and education of correct portion sizes and maintaining portion control  Discussion between the participants on their experience with the study and the changes they had made, with focus given to maintenance, staying in control, and avoiding relapse     2.4. Dietary Assessment 2.4.1. PREDIMED Questionnaire Participants completed PREDIMED questionnaires at baseline and post-intervention.",ef575618-f5ec-4ddc-9178-8ac2d2d42a62
5,methods5," The 14-item questionnaire was the primary measure used in this study to appraise adherence of participants to the MD. The characteristics of participants were compared according to three categories of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (≤5 (low), 6–9 (medium), and ≥10 (high) points of the 14-item questionnaire). Each question was scored 0 or 1. If the condition of a question was not met, 0 points were recorded for the category. The final PREDIMED score ranged from 0 to 14.  2.4.2. Three-Day Food Diary Participants were required to complete one three-day food diary during the intervention period. Verbal (face-to-face and/or telephonic) instructions were provided to the intervention groups, written instructions and phone support were provided to the control group. Collected data reflected a combination of actual (measured or weighed) and estimated food consumption.",57fd0a86-cc87-48f6-8544-58d4f1cd135f
6,methods6," The diaries were assessed and analysed for total servings across a range of food groups (grains and grain products, milk and dairy products, chicken, red meats and its products, eggs, fish and seafood, fruit, vegetables, nuts or seeds, legumes and beans, sweets, baking and chocolate, sugar, honey, olive oil, other fats and oils, coffee, alcohol, sweet drinks, and tea). Standard serving sizes were used, according to the New Zealand Ministry of Health Nutrition guidelines [6].  2.5. Quality of Life. FACT-B Questionnaire Participants were asked to complete a functional assessment of cancer therapy-breast (FACT-B) questionnaire at baseline and post-intervention to assess the effects of group education.",dae135e9-72ad-4189-9a99-67831b064965
7,methods7," This questionnaire is a self-reporting tool designed to measure multi-dimensional quality of life in patients with breast cancer, and is split into six subscales, namely physical well-being (physical well being (PWB)), social/family well-being (social/family well being (SWB)), emotional well-being (emotional well being (EWB)), functional well-being (functional well being (FWB)), relationship with doctor (relationship with doctor (RWD)), and the additional concerns for breast cancer (breast cancer (BCS)). A higher score indicates a higher health-related quality of life in the participant.  2.6. Blood Tests The glycosylated haemoglobin percentage (HbA1c %) and lipid panels were conducted on whole blood immediately following blood sample collection in EDTA vacutainers, with remaining sample aliquots frozen at −80 degrees Celsius for later analysis using the Afinion AS100 Test Cartridge (Waltham, MA, USA).  2.7.",afed268c-3433-4f92-a1d6-e25193f5af80
8,methods8," Anthropometry All measurements were conducted using the International Society for Anthropometry and Kinanthropometry (International Society for Anthropometry and Kinanthropometry (ISAK)) protocol by a Level 3 International Society for Anthropometry and Kinanthropometry (ISAK) Certified Practitioner. Weight (kg) was taken on calibrated load scales (Advasco Scales Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) without shoes or extraneous clothing. Height (m) was taken as a freestanding height measurement on a stadiometer (University of Auckland, Grafton Campus) without shoes. body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the equation: weight (kg)/height (m)2. The weight measurements were taken at two time-points—at baseline and at post-intervention—using the same scales. Height was recorded at baseline. body mass index (BMI) was calculated at the same time as each weight measurement, using the single height measurement as the denominator.",cf61aa36-7ca8-4a2f-b8c3-9cc9ccddce44
9,methods9," Waist circumference was measured twice—once at baseline and once post-intervention—using Lufkin steel tape. All measurements were taken by the same individual.  2.8. Outcome Measures The primary outcome measures for this study included: change in body weight (kg), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), and waist circumference (cm).  The secondary outcome measures included: change in lipids (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol:HDL cholesterol ratio, and triglycerides), HbA1c %, adherence to a Mediterranean eating pattern (PREDIMED questionnaire), quality of life score (FACT-B questionnaire), group education attendance, and three-day food diary intake.  2.9. Data Analysis SPSS Version 23.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. Data was assessed for normality using the D’Agostine & Pearson normality test, and data was normally distributed.",946c2a22-2fb9-4937-9428-1d00ccd71956
10,methods10," The study compared the means and standard deviations (SD) or 95% confidence intervals (CI) of outcome indexes (weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood lipid levels, PREDIMED and FACT-B questionnaire data) across the three dietary arms. Associations between these baseline and post-intervention measurements were evaluated using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significance was defined as p < 0.05. Statistical analyses excluded missing and undetermined data. Tukey honest significant difference (honest significant difference (HSD)) post-hoc testing was performed if there were statistically significant differences in the results with the aim of determining where those differences lay.  3. Results The final analysis was conducted on those participants who completed the study (MD n = 15, LF n = 12, control group n = 13). Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.",37b22de7-451c-4e33-982b-c472da491863
11,methods11," The mean body mass index (BMI) across all dietary arms showed that the participants were categorised as being overweight according to the body mass index (BMI) criteria (<18.5 underweight, 18.5–24.9 normal, 25–29.9 overweight, and >30 obese). The vast majority of participants (68%) identified as being of New Zealand European ethnicity; all other ethnicities are listed in Table 1. All other variables, including weight, waist circumference, HbA1c %, total cholesterol, HDL and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterols, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol:HDL cholesterol ratio levels were similarly matched across the three dietary arms. There were no deaths over the course of this study.  Greater weight loss was observed among MD participants, compared to the LF participants, whilst the control arm participants on average gained weight (Table 2). The range of weight change was greatest in the Mediterranean group.",5fd8f02d-7efe-4ec7-a45c-460dd2fe7dfe
12,methods12,"   Following analysis using a one-way ANOVA to compare means, the body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference variables experienced significant differences between groups (p = 0.047 and p = 0.045, respectively). The control group saw a small increase in score (Table 3). Significant differences were observed between groups in the post-intervention PREDIMED score.  No significant differences were observed between groups both pre- and post-intervention in the FACT-B quality of life questionnaire scores.  4. Discussion The results of this study demonstrate that the adoption of an MD induces weight loss amongst participants and decreases body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference towards more desirable measurements. The LF dietary arm also lost weight; however, the changes were less marked.",e1ddf0d2-3b8e-44b9-92da-fa5f58f23bf7
13,methods13," Conversely, the control participants gained weight, and increased waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) measurements, thus suggesting that dietary education and support for dietary change elicit these findings. The control group gained on average 1.10 kg per participant, suggesting that significant input is required to even maintain weight. As such, dietary educational input for healthy weight attainment is needed in the breast cancer survivor population. Participants demonstrated that they were able to adhere to either intervention.  At present, a diet low in saturated fat and high in fruit and vegetables is advocated to those with cancer, along with maintaining a healthy body weight. Previous research has demonstrated effective weight loss and improved inflammatory outcomes in both cardiac and diabetic populations [7]. Breast cancer patients typically gain weight post diagnosis, which is associated with a worse prognosis.",f5759513-2452-4b00-9bbb-0baf8273e24d
14,methods14," As such, the MD may assist in weight loss and improve the inflammatory profile to a greater extent than the currently recommended healthy, low-fat diet. The MD is a plant-based dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of olive oil, legumes, whole grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and fish, and is rich in dietary polyphenols. The diet has been linked to a decreased risk of developing breast cancer [8]. Little research has been conducted on those already diagnosed with breast cancer.  There was a tendency for desirable shifts in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), HDL, and total:HDL cholesterols from baseline to the final measures taken after the intervention in the dietary arms that received group education; however, the changes observed were not statistically significant.",51743822-f806-43c9-ba1c-80eba8571848
15,methods15," Those participants asked to follow an MD diet decreased the average total cholesterol the most, but the participants following an LF diet showed more remarkable desired changes in HDL, low density lipoprotein (LDL), non-HDL, and total:HDL cholesterols, and triglyceride levels. However, the post-intervention measurements still fall within recommended parameters.   Additionally, the control group showed no change in their total cholesterol or low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The results regarding HbA1c %—a longer-term measurement of blood glucose levels—are less clear, and a true pattern cannot be seen from this study; however, the measurements were deemed to be within the normal range [9].  Follow-up studies should continue to include a no-treatment control group, but define the intervention to a particular histology and stage of cancer given the heterogeneous nature of the disease.  5.",04821217-2821-464f-b8b8-4e9e95a09cbb
16,methods16," Conclusions Nutritional education and group support appears to be beneficial to breast cancer survivors, and of lesser importance is the type of diet that forms the basis of the education. With regards to breast cancer, weight is an important factor worthy of intervention and monitoring past the stage of active treatment. Women would benefit from regular assessment, routine follow-up visits until treatment cessation, complimented with regular dietitian and dietary follow-up post-treatment.
