0,methods0," Participants and recruitment  A cross-sectional study was undertaken amongst community-dwelling older adults ≥60 years. Older Australians who were permanent residents of Australia, free from dementia or cognitive decline and could independently complete an anonymous online survey in English were invited to participate. Participants were recruited via social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn, and networking with the Local Government Councils from February 2022 to May 2022 requesting voluntary participation. The investigators disseminated the survey link using the aforementioned social media platforms weekly across these dates. Qualtrics™ survey software was used to construct and distribute the survey. A link to the survey was disseminated via social media platforms where the study protocol and potential risks were clearly outlined to all interested participants.",914d1688-6230-434d-be97-8eac370a3e5d
1,methods1," Exclusion criteria included those <60 years of age, those with dementia or cognitive decline and/or unable to complete the online survey in English and/or did not permanently reside in Australia. This study was conducted according to the guidelines described in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Research Ethics Committees at the University of the Sunshine Coast (S221680) and the University of South Australia (204450). Participants acknowledged an informed consent statement prior to participation in the study.  Data collection  A 75-item self-administered questionnaire was used to assess the relationship between adherence to a MedDiet, risk of cognitive impairment and ADLs. The questionnaire was divided into six separate sections and included previously validated tools including the Lawton's iADLs scale (41, 42), AD8 dementia screening intervention (43–45), Depression Anxiety Scale (DASS-21) (46) and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) (47, 48).",99e25649-96a7-454f-a79f-e90d547900f4
2,methods2," An additional four questions pertaining to eating behaviors and socialization characteristics related a traditional MedDiet lifestyle were also adapted from the MediCul tool (49). The questionnaire also consisted of open and closed-ended questions related to participant demographic characteristics, which included self-reported height and weight, presence of disease, medications, physical activity status, sleep duration and smoking status. The questionnaire was designed to be completed in ~30 min. There were no time restrictions applied to complete the questionnaire and participants were not required to answer all questions before proceeding to subsequent questions. The link to the survey was recognizable once only to the server it was sent thus preventing duplication when responding to the survey. The investigators also screened all of the participant responses (IP address and postcode viewed) to ensure all responses were consistent with the eligibility criteria.",d479e1d1-386d-4865-91ba-b4976c2c05ab
3,methods3," For the purpose of the present study, we will report on data from the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), Lawton's iADLs and the AD8 dementia screening intervention.  Instrumental activities of daily living  The modified Lawton iADL scale was used to assess functional ability (41). This previously validated tool comprised of eight questions assessing instrumental activities including: ability to use the telephone, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, mode of transportation, responsibility for own medications and ability to handle finances (41, 42). For each question, participants were asked to select the option that closely resembles their highest level of function. Each question was rated a dichotomized value (0 for less able and 1 for more able). The aforementioned eight items were summed to form a score ranging from 0 to 8, with 8 representing no disability in iADLs.",8db38e8c-a148-4179-8546-2c4a6fad225b
4,methods4,"  Cognitive function  Cognitive function was assessed using the self-administered AD8 dementia screening intervention which is a validated instrument to help discriminate between signs of normal cognition and mild dementia (43). The tool is comprised of eight items which assess cognitive abilities related to memory, orientation, judgment, and executive function (44). For each of the items, participants were asked to rate if they had noticed any changes in the last few years. Each question was rated in accordance with three possible categories: yes, a change; no change; do not know. A score of one for each ‘yes, a change' and zero for each ‘no change' or ‘do not know' were applied. As such, higher scores are suggestive of cognitive decline (44, 45). Specifically, a score ≥2 is suggestive of cognitive impairment.",ec740d24-1761-4270-be13-b75f51bbed88

The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) includes 12 questions which assess the main dietary elements of a traditional MedDiet, and two questions related to food intake behaviors that are consistent with a MedDiet (48). Each of the 14 questions is scored dichotomously as 0 or 1, generating a maximum score of 14 where higher scores are reflective of greater adherence to a MedDiet (48). Specifically, for food intake behaviors consistent with a MedDiet pattern, one point was awarded if participants identified using olive oil as their main source of dietary fat; one point was also awarded for preferentially consuming white meat over red meat.",0e96a08f-19f1-4895-a01e-f45b78f3cd6d

19,discussion1,"  Our findings are indeed consistent with previous literature suggesting that adherence to a MedDiet is positively associated with self-reported ADLs (50, 51). Unlike our findings, in a community-based, multiethnic longitudinal study of older adults (n = 1,696) aged ≥65 years from the United States, Guo et al. (52) reported that higher levels of adherence to a MedDiet was inversely associated with disability in accordance with BADL but not for iADLs. However, this inverse association was not observed across all multiethnic groups and no longer significant when adjusted for smoking status and co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. In the present study, the level of significance was maintained across a broad range of covariates including smoking status and self-reported diabetes. Importantly however, we did not adjust for ethnicity or other chronic diseases known to influence functional status and risk of disability, such as cardiovascular disease (53).",665ae160-57c7-4cfb-8270-4f7f708b9a13
20,discussion2," Furthermore, unlike the aforementioned studies, we used different instruments to assess MedDiet adherence and ADLs. As such, any observed differences in associations between MedDiet adherence and ADLs can at least be partially explained by the marked heterogeneity (e.g., study population, study design, length of follow-up, assessment tools, residual confounders etc) across different studies. Nevertheless, there is indeed overwhelming evidence to support that adherence to a MedDiet is inversely associated with incident frailty risk (30, 31) and characteristics of the physical frailty phenotype, in particular gait speed (54–57).  We further showed that MedDiet adherence was inversely associated with cognitive risk in community-dwelling older adults.",e7f4dae6-b582-4acf-83f2-e701d293bad6
21,discussion3," These findings are consistent with recent meta-analytical data supporting that high adherence to a MedDiet is cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with overall cognitive function, MMSE scores and memory in older adults free from dementia (58). These findings have also been demonstrated in non-Mediterranean countries, including the United States and Australia (59, 60). In a longitudinal analysis of community-dwelling adults living in Central New York (MSLS study), Wade et al. (59) reported longitudinal associations between MedDiet adherence and global cognitive and executive functioning in older adults ≥70 years. Similarly, in a cross-sectional analysis of the Sydney Memory and Aging Study (Memory and Aging Study (MAS)), Chen et al. (60) reported that adherence to a MedDiet was positively associated with visuospatial cognition. Nevertheless, these findings are not all consistent. A recent systematic review by Limongi et al.",ee8ffcec-109d-4246-8b8c-688178337fa5
22,discussion4," (61) suggested that whilst adherence to a MedDiet may indeed be associated with improved cognitive health, its relationship with other specific cognitive domains (e.g., memory, language, executive function) remains unclear, likely due to the heterogeneity in the modalities used to assess cognitive outcomes, thus making the interpretation of the findings challenging. Importantly, methodological differences in how the MedDiet is operationalized is also likely to contribute to inconsistent findings. As such, many of the aforementioned studies assessed adherence to a MedDiet using (or an adaptation of) the Mediterranean Diet Score developed by Trichopoulou et al. (62) which is dependent on the habitual dietary characteristics of the studied population and may not reflect true adherence to a MedDiet, particularly in non-Mediterranean countries (63).",36bf4710-9d76-42d9-98c9-de7022b20160
23,discussion5," In the present study, we assessed adherence to the MedDiet using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), which is based on normative criteria and reflective of a Mediterranean-style diet.  Given the heterogeneity and potential limitations associated with MedDiet adherence tools, examining individual dietary constituents of the dietary pattern may assist in standardizing research methodologies and help quantify intake of specific food groups to ensure maximum health-related benefits. In the present study, we showed that nut consumption (as defined by the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) was inversely associated with cognitive risk, independent of age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking status, sleep duration, physical activity duration, diabetes status, and level of education.",9b2708b2-3db1-46fa-879a-dac211cd38f8
24,discussion6," These results are consistent with the Memory and Aging Study (MAS) study (60) which showed significant positive associations between nut consumption and better global cognition and higher scores in multiple cognitive domains, including processing speed, language, visuospatial and executive functioning. Using cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, Tan et al. (64) reported that moderate nut intake (15–30 grams per day) was associated with better cognitive performance in older adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, a comprehensive systematic review found inconsistent evidence related to regular nut consumption and cognitive health in adults across a range of different ages (65). Although marked heterogeneity across individual studies was reported, more homogeneous findings were observed in studies examining the association between walnut consumption and cognitive performance, particularly in older adults.",b476b1e1-26e9-4e95-8232-b7c0c1705205
25,discussion7," This is also supported from the results of the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) study which showed that a MedDiet supplemented mixed nuts (almonds, walnuts, and hazelnuts) or EVOO improved global cognitive performance after 6.5 years of the nutritional intervention when compared against a low-fat control group (47). Nevertheless, not all clinical trials have identified significant differences in cognitive performance in older adults after dietary interventions supplemented with nuts (66, 67). Of note, in our sensitivity analyses, the inverse relationship between nut consumption and cognitive risk observed in the present study was no longer significant in participants free from cognitive decline. Irrespective, nuts are nutrient dense, providing rich amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, fiber and antioxidants which contribute to a healthy dietary pattern, such as the MedDiet (68–70).",7654a01d-2a43-426f-8697-7138c0b00560
26,discussion8," As such, the underlying mechanisms attributable to nut consumption and better cognition are likely to be multifaceted, including improvements in endothelial function and enhanced cerebral blood flow, regulation of brain glucose concentrations and enhanced intestinal microbiota composition (71–73).  Further, we also observed an inverse relationship between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and cognitive risk. In a subsample (n = 806) of the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN)) cohort, Munoz-Garcia et al. (74) also reported that the consumption of more than 1 sugar-sweetened beverage per month, compared to seldom consumption, was significantly associated with a decline in cognitive function after 6 years. However, unlike our study, the aforementioned study was a longitudinal analysis of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption from the previous year using a validated 136-item semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire.",9fba16cc-9130-447d-8bbe-7b81f39ed936
27,discussion9," Moreover, the investigators also used an alternative instrument to assess cognitive risk [modified Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (STICS-m)] and different frequency of consumption criteria to define sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, making comparisons of the study findings difficult. Our sensitivity analyses also showed that this relationship was no longer significant in participants free from cognitive decline in our study sample. However, we also observed that low consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and increased vegetable intake (≥2 serves per day in accordance with the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) were both positively associated with iADLs. This finding was also consistent in our sensitivity analyses. These observations are also consistent with previous longitudinal (75) and meta-analytic analyses (76) related to sugar-sweetened beverage and vegetable consumption on the risks associated with physical frailty.",d2f5e2be-173a-47e2-acaf-2aac0d7499c0
28,discussion10," Specifically, in older women (n = 71,935) participating in the Nurses' Health Study, Struijk et al. (75) showed that habitual consumption of ≥1 serving per day of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with a higher risk of frailty during a 22-year follow-up. Moreover, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported that greater vegetable consumption was associated with lower risk of incident frailty among community-dwelling older adults (76).  However, the paradigm of assessing dietary patterns as opposed to individual nutrients or single foods as a determinant of chronic disease risk has been recognized for some time (77). With respect to the MedDiet, there are several nutritive mechanisms associated with the beneficial effects of an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern on cognition and functional status (78–82).",4326af17-0474-44ae-aa12-8e3495f91451
29,discussion11," In particular, anti-inflammatory dietary patterns have been shown to reduce central adiposity, blood pressure and platelet aggregation, all of which are protective against atherosclerosis and improve vascular blood flow, leading to reduced cardiovascular risk and improved brain functioning (78, 80). In addition, oxidative stress and low-grade chronic inflammation are also observed with age-related chronic diseases, including cognitive decline and physical frailty (83–85). As such, the high antioxidant capacity of the MedDiet has a key role in modulating signaling pathways involved in the up regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species (86), and therefore may play an important role in preserving physical and cognitive status with age. Lastly, the MedDiet is also rich in bioactive properties, including omega-3 fatty acids (87), which may have direct effects on gut microbiota, which has been shown to influence neurocognitive health (73, 78).",4758e542-8efc-4797-8d24-33a269428e79
30,discussion12,"  There are several limitations that must be considered when interpreting the results of this study. Firstly, the cross-sectional study design prevents causality from being determined. Additionally, our results may be overstated given that our sample were relatively healthy, independent, and free from mobility disability and cognitive impairment (as per iADL and AD8 scores). Nevertheless, our sample was not entirely homogenous given that one-quarter of the study sample were at risk of cognitive impairment, as defined by AD8 scores. Importantly, when we removed participants at risk of cognitive impairment in our sensitivity analyses, no significant relationship between MedDiet adherence (or individual MedDiet components) and cognitive risk was observed.",0d8e12af-e6f0-4342-bda7-8d0ed5d8e348
31,discussion13," This is indeed an interesting finding given that it could be hypothesized that nutrients and dietary patterns alike are more likely to exert a greater influence on cognition before the onset of cognitive decline or neurodegenerative diseases. However, this was not observed in the present study; nevertheless, by and large our participants were independent and relatively healthy and therefore may have a narrower range of normal cognitive function. Perhaps most pertinently, the limited scale which defines ‘normal cognition' (e.g., AD8 score <2) in the AD8 dementia screening tool that was used in the present study is likely to reduce the magnitude of the association in our sensitivity analyses. Further to this, the lack of association between adherence to a MedDiet and cognitive risk in participants free from cognitive decline may also be due to modest adherence scores, and in particular a lack of participants with high adherence, thus limiting the generalizability of our study findings.",695f5d40-0a46-4e5e-8a41-834c5ec330f8
32,discussion14," Moreover, it is unknown whether these findings are generalizable to more vulnerable populations at greater risk of functional and cognitive decline, such as institutionalized older adults. Given the nature of our study cohort and method of recruitment (e.g., participation in an online survey), the potential for selection bias is an important consideration in the interpretation of these study findings. In addition, although our multiple regression analyses were adjusted for important confounders, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. In particular, we did not consider nor capture all aspects of dietary intake. For example, western dietary patterns (higher in free sugars and saturated fat) have been found to be associated with risk of physical frailty and cognitive impairment, respectively (88–91). Further to this, we did not adjust for other important covariates associated with cognitive status and physical frailty such as total energy intake.",45eed4a3-1ba0-45b1-940a-a46a53566208
33,discussion15," There is also a possibility that our multiple regression analyses were over-adjusted, leading to selection bias and thus reducing the precision of the effect estimates (e.g., influence of MedDiet adherence) (92). Another important limitation was that dietary intake data and the iADL and AD8 instruments were self-reported thus increasing the potential for recall or social desirability bias. In addition, both the Lawton's iADL and AD8 dementia screening intervention instruments used in the present study are screening tools and are not typically used to assess mobility disability and cognitive impairment, respectively. Nevertheless, the AD8 has previously been validated against performance based cognitive screening assessments such as the MMSE and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) which are both commonly used as cognitive assessment tools (43).",d2cfae34-0da2-4781-9def-25d1aad526a1
34,discussion16," Moreover, the Lawton iADL scale has been widely used and is validated to assess functional status in older adults with or at risk of dementia (42).  In conclusion, these cross-sectional analyses demonstrated that adherence to a MedDiet was positively associated with functional status (iADL) and inversely associated with risk of cognitive decline in community-dwelling older adults.
