0,analysis0, Characteristics of participants are described as mean and standard deviation (sd) for continuous variables and as numbers and percentages (%) for categorical variables. Non-normally distributed variables are presented as the median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)). Independent Student's t-test and χ2 test were used to examine the baseline differences in characteristics between participants included and participants excluded for data analysis. The differences in characteristics and dietary patterns between malnourished and non-malnourished participants were examined using the χ2 test for categorical variables and by t-test for continuous variables.  The association between each dietary pattern and the presence of malnutrition was analysed using binary logistic regression models. The DQI-I score and the three dietary pattern scores derived by the factor analysis were first stratified into tertiles based on the distribution of each sex.,7c97a188-d0f2-4c6c-9428-bbc2afbc9608
1,analysis1," The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was divided into two levels of adherence, using at least 4⋅5 as a cut-off value(27). The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) score was divided into three levels of adherence, namely low (0–3), medium (4–5) and high (6–9)(28,31). Test for trend was examined by entering tertiles of each dietary pattern or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence or three levels of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) as a continuous variable in all models. We also examined the interaction between sex and each dietary pattern by the addition of cross-product terms to the regression models. The interaction was significant, and all subsequent analyses were stratified by sex. Model 1 was the crude model.

12,discussion0," Our findings supported that healthier dietary patterns were associated with malnutrition according to the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria in Chinese community-dwelling older adults. In men, a higher DQI-I score, a higher ‘vegetable–fruit’ dietary pattern score and a lower ‘meat–fish’ dietary pattern score were associated with a lower risk of malnutrition. In women, higher adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with a lower risk of malnutrition. However, after the Bonferroni correction, the associations remained statistically significant only in men for the DQI-I score.  The gender difference in the results may be explained by several factors. Men, in general, showed less healthy dietary patterns and lifestyles than women.",75e276f4-bd8a-41bd-b7b5-5578178a6501
13,discussion1," Therefore, data from men may be more heterogeneous compared with women, in which significant associations between dietary patterns and malnutrition were more easily detected in the present study. Another factor may be due to the fewer number of women being classified as malnutrition compared with men. These results may reflect the more unfavourable eating habits of older men (particularly those who lived alone) of not cooking at home but relying on fast food and takeaway lunch boxes(32–34). Taking away is an alternative for people who do not like cooking nor eating alone in restaurants(35). Further exploration of our data showed that men who lived alone had lower dietary quality as assessed by the ‘vegetable–fruit’ dietary pattern score than those who lived with others. Although the dietary data were collected almost 20 years ago, research has shown that the dietary habits of older adults are relatively stable over time(36–38).",8237d28e-281b-4376-aca5-5bee553b5e1b
14,discussion2,"  To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first study to examine different dietary patterns on malnutrition according to the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria in community-dwelling older adults. Direct comparison with similar studies was therefore not feasible due to the different criteria used to classify malnutrition such as MNA(9,39,40), low body mass index (BMI) and/or involuntary weight loss(8). In general, previous studies supported our findings that higher dietary variety(39) and better diet quality(10,11) were associated with a lower risk of malnutrition.  As our participants that were identified as malnourished fulfilled the aetiologic criterion of inflammation or disease burden; therefore, the influence of diet on disease-related malnutrition according to the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria is expected.",f20c6aa0-7d94-4c06-970c-547afaee398f
15,discussion3," The literature has shown the association between diet and inflammatory statuses such as high hsCRP and disease burden(15,41,42). In Chinese community-dwelling older adults, a higher DQI-I score was associated with a lower hsCRP level in men but this association was not observed in women(15). A higher meat and instant food dietary pattern score has also been reported to be associated with higher hsCRP levels in Taiwanese community-dwelling older adults(43). Furthermore, a systematic review supports the notion that a positive association exists between meat-based diets and low-grade chronic inflammation(44), which may contribute to the higher levels of overall inflammation and oxidative stress that are often associated with muscle ageing and chronic diseases(45,46). Although the positive association between the ‘meat–fish’ pattern and malnutrition was not significant after the Bonferroni correction, the direction of the association was somehow reasonable.",d4e852a1-4037-4cff-a917-14a1372b6a77
16,discussion4," Inflammation contributes to malnutrition through associated anorexia and decreased food intake, as well as altered metabolism with an elevation of resting energy expenditure and increased muscle catabolism(12). The ‘meat–fish’ pattern had high factor loadings for dim sum, red and processed meats, poultry, fish and seafood; however, it did not load high on vegetables and fruits. Although adequate protein intake may play a role in counteracting disease-related malnutrition, too much protein intake may raise an acidic environment. It has been proposed that metabolic acidosis can cause tissue damage, which can further initiate inflammatory responses(47). Vegetables and fruits could provide antioxidants to quench free radicals and reduce damage from reactive oxygen species and inflammatory status(48). The absence of these foods may partly explain the positive associations observed with the ‘meat–fish’ pattern.",e11455f5-4dcf-44be-a1b3-57438a964692
17,discussion5," The findings suggest that the balance of total diet and variety may be most important in determining its role on the risk of disease-related malnutrition.  It should be noted that our participants that were identified as malnourished fulfilled more often the phenotypic criterion of low muscle mass than of low body mass index (BMI). A previous study showed that adherence to a Western dietary pattern (high in red meat, fried foods and high-fat dairy) was associated with higher D3Cr muscle mass, while the healthy dietary pattern (high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meats) was not associated with D3Cr muscle mass or appendicular muscle mass assessed using dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) in older men(49). The findings are somewhat different from those found in the present study, in which a lower adherence to ‘meat–fish’ dietary pattern was associated with a lower risk of malnutrition. The previous study did not specify the aetiology of low muscle mass.",d9472419-63e9-4091-9dfa-6acf55bc7c69
18,discussion6," Therefore, the different findings may be explained by inflammation/disease burden as the aetiology in our participants as described earlier, compared with other aetiologies of low muscle mass such as reduced food intake or assimilation(12). However, the absence of associations between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and malnutrition in the present study were similar to those reported by Huang et al. in which Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were not associated with muscle mass among Japanese older adults(50). The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) uses the group median intake of each component as the cut-off value for calculation.",35793736-3822-42bc-a298-ffe7285edc1f
19,discussion7," This scoring system may result in bias in that the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) calculation is based on cohort- and sex-specific median values across food categories of the studied population; therefore, the score may not be related to a healthy level of intake per se(51).  Given the association between DQI-I score and malnutrition found in the present study, it appears that improving dietary quality could potentially reduce the risk of malnutrition in older adults, particularly in the aspects of a high variety of foods, adequate intake of healthy foods, moderate intake of nutrients that are related to chronic diseases and an overall balance in macronutrients and fatty acids(25). Nonetheless, it should be noted that older adults often encounter barriers to healthy eating, including social determinants (e.g. eating alone), health problems (e.g. impaired mobility, vision and dental problems) and decreased financial and social support.",17731dd5-6035-44ed-900d-aed5fe122840
20,discussion8," This age group also seems to struggle with change more than other age groups, as ‘resistance to change’ and ‘giving up liked foods’ have been identified as barriers unique to this age group(52). This emphasises the importance of promoting healthy eating through a life-course approach and the need for healthcare professionals to address these age-specific barriers during health promotion(53).  The strengths of the present study included the analysis of various dietary patterns, which allowed assessment of the interaction among synergistic components in the diet and facilitated the development of food-based dietary guidelines(7,54). A wide range of participants’ lifestyle factors allowed us to adjust for their confounding effects in the analyses. However, the cross-sectional data cannot infer a causal relationship because data of dietary patterns and malnutrition according to the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria were obtained at the same time.",64ddfc3b-768e-43e9-a916-82d183a63caa
21,discussion9," Second, dietary data were collected using food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) which may be subject to recall bias. Third, our participants were of higher educational level and were able to travel to the study site; therefore, they were more likely to be more health-conscious and have a better diet compared to the general population. Therefore, the results may not be extrapolated to the general target population or applicable to other countries with different cultures and dietary cultures. Fourth, although a statistically significant difference of DQI-I score was found between men with and without malnutrition, whether it is a clinically relevant difference is not well-defined in the literature. Lastly, data of weight loss and reduced food intake were not available in our dataset.",8039ad3e-ea84-4094-9946-fb1b1506cc6b
22,discussion10," These criteria are important, as it has been shown that Chinese community-dwelling older adults who had a lack of appetite and meal skipping behavior (may imply insufficient food intake and subsequent weight loss) had a higher risk of malnutrition defined by the MNA(55). However, based on our data collected at the 2-year follow-up, the prevalence of weight loss (10⋅2 %) and reduced food intake (6⋅0 %) was low. Therefore, although the prevalence of malnutrition may have been underestimated using the modified Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, we do not expect a huge difference in the association between dietary patterns and malnutrition if the original Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria was applied in our population.",c9993668-07e4-4e2c-9fa1-57424d7c939c
23,discussion11,"  Conclusions  In community-dwelling Chinese older adults in Hong Kong, a better diet quality as characterised by a higher DQI-I score was associated with a lower risk of malnutrition according to the modified Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria in men, whereas dietary patterns were not associated with malnutrition in women. Nutritional strategies for the prevention and management of disease-related malnutrition could potentially be targeted on dietary quality in the aspects of variety, adequacy, moderation and overall balance, with the consideration of age-specific barriers to healthy eating.
