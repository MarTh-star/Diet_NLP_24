0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design  The present cross-sectional study is about the nutritional quality of menus offered in restaurants and the availability of allergen-free dishes of Tarragona province restaurants. It includes the baseline data of the Healthy Meals Randomized Controlled Trial (Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)), which is a multicomponent intervention applied to restaurants and their staff, including training, menu nutritional quality analysis and identification of food allergens, to promote healthier meals for each member of a family and improved management of food allergens, and to satisfy customers with specific needs (food allergies and intolerances). It was carried out from September 2019 to March 2021, before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This study is part of a European funded project called PECT-TurisTIC en Familia, through which the University Rovira i Virgili (Tarragona, Spain) has led the “Healthy Meals” operation, one of the twelve operations included in the project.",5b1fba9c-8b9f-4837-bb5e-ba5157a2cf24
1,methods1," The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [28], and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institut d’Investigació Sanitaria Pere Virgili (ref CEIM: 179/2018). The trial was registered in 2019 at the international registry of clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov) [29] with the project identification code NCT03826576. All restaurant owners gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. Moreover, to ensure the study quality, the present study followed the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)) criteria [30] for observational cross-sectional studies (Table S1).  2.2. Study Population and Setting  The study population consisted of full-service restaurants offering traditional and Mediterranean cuisine that were recruited from the province of Tarragona (Spain).",ad84a727-f169-4fb2-a85c-e7614d424a67
2,methods2," Restaurants were searched, considering the population density of the different counties of the Tarragona province [31], through the tourism offices of each participating town and online restaurant databases, such as TripAdvisor [32]. The study researchers visited the restaurants and explained the study to the owner/responsible party of each restaurant to obtain informed consent. Then, the researchers verified whether the restaurants met the inclusion criteria: (1) being a full-service restaurant; (2) having a minimum of 5 serviced tables; (3) offering Mediterranean/traditional/local cuisine; (4) having technical details of the recipe for each dish, including ingredients and cooking details; (5) being willing to share food product information with the research team; and (6) the owner signing an informed consent form for participation in the study.",c5b6c69c-6eb9-4bfc-91bc-f372abbfd8c2
3,methods3," On the other hand, restaurants were excluded if they (1) were ethnic or fast-food restaurants; (2) had fewer than 5 serviced tables; or (3) had not yet received the Mediterranean diet (AMed) certification.  Furthermore, restaurant owners had to (1) have a minimum of one year of experience and (2) be available to continue working during the one-year intervention. Not fulfilling any of the above inclusion criteria led to exclusion from the study.  2.3. Outcomes and Data Collection  The primary outcomes included the following:(1) number of compulsory AMed criteria, which must be fulfilled by restaurants to obtain a certification that the restaurant offers a Mediterranean diet (described below), as determined through face-to-face interviews with the restaurant owner;  (2) number of SMAP criteria fulfilled by restaurants,",e2233589-da9e-4d8c-99d7-cfaf5c11d3bf
4,methods4," as assessed through face-to-face interviews with the restaurant owner to determine the potential for obtaining the corresponding certification;  (3) number of dishes per restaurant with a green rating in the traffic light rating system on the Healthy Meals app for the evaluated nutrients (energy, carbohydrates, sugar, fat, saturated fat, protein, sodium and fibre), which indicates good nutritional quality, according to the analysis of the recipes of the dishes, including the ingredients, weights and cooking details;  (4) nutrient content of the restaurants’ meals (kcal of energy; grams of carbohydrates, sugar, fat, saturated fat, protein and fibre; micrograms of sodium), assessed by the Healthy Meals web-based app, which was designed and developed by researchers according to the framework of the PECT-TurisTIC en Familia project;  (5) allergen content assessment, identified through the Healthy Meals web-based app;  (6) adequacy of vegetarian and vegan dishes,",08829ac8-27a9-4067-b171-5f0c0e0d57bf
5,methods5," also evaluated through the Healthy Meals app.  As a secondary outcome, restaurant staff knowledge about the Mediterranean diet and food allergens was evaluated through paper-based questionnaires.  The primary outcomes were assessed as follows:  2.3.1. AMed Criteria  The AMed criteria were designed by the Spanish Public Health Agency as the basis for an official certification that can be provided to restaurants and the establishment of a food service that guarantees the offering of a menu based on the Mediterranean diet [33]. The criteria are divided into nine mandatory and eight optional criteria (available at www.amed.cat, accessed on 20 January 2019) [33].",ac781582-b398-4cd7-820d-b1a4a0197a9f
6,methods6," All 17 criteria were evaluated, but for the purpose of achieving the primary outcome, only the nine mandatory criteria were considered: (1) olive oil is used in dressings, and olive oil or high oleic sunflower are used for cooking; (2) 25% of the first course offerings are vegetables and/or legumes; (3) whole-grain products are included; (4) 50% of the second course offerings are based on fish, seafood or lean meat; (5) 50% of the dessert offerings are based on fresh fruit (whole or prepared); (6) dairy desserts without added sugar are offered; (7) free nonpackaged drinking water is offered; (8) wine, beer and cava are measured in glasses or individual units; (9) culinary preparations that do not require the addition of large amounts of fat, and culinary techniques that use little or no fat are used.  2.3.2.",fe843993-433d-48c5-bcd3-cd912da0f6ad
7,methods7," Gluten Management (SMAP) Criteria  The SMAP criteria were developed by the Catalan Celiac Association [34] as the basis for obtaining the official SMAP certification for gluten-free food preparation. This recognition is intended to encourage restaurateurs to implement correct practices for allergen-free cooking and to avoid cross-contamination. The SMAP criteria include 18 recommendations that were evaluated in this study for assessing one of the primary outcomes [34].  2.3.3. Nutritional Content Assessment of Restaurant-Offered Dishes  Dishes offered by the included restaurants were classified as starters, main dishes and desserts.  The nutritional quality of each meal was analysed through the Healthy Meals app using the recipes for each dish, including the ingredients used, their quantities and the cooking process. Home-spun ingredient measurements were converted to the equivalent quantity in grams.",22a77494-0a6a-415e-9f8a-864c38a81263
8,methods8," A food composition database for the extraction of the necessary nutritional data was generated from the nutritional information of commercial food products and data from different public databases [35,36,37,38,39]. The food ingredient database was used for the development of the Healthy Meals web-based app, which was used for the nutritional assessment of the restaurants’ dishes. The information obtained for each dish included the energy (Kcal), protein (g), total carbohydrates (g), sugar (g), total fat (g), saturated fat (g), fibre (g) and sodium (mg).  From the nutritional information calculated, a traffic light rating system for a single-plate portion was created; the system classified the content of each nutrient according to three colours, namely red (high), orange (medium) or green (good), in agreement with the cut-offs of the UK Food Standards Agency [40]. Based on a single-plate portion, nutrients were classified as (a) green when the dish contained <7.",82985b06-7e89-49e3-8b23-9c9524763eac

However, the fibre content was classified inversely so that a red label corresponded to a low fibre content according to the recommendations.  Single dishes from the included restaurants were then evaluated through the traffic light system, and a number of healthy meals were identified as green-light dishes.  2.3.4.",642a9adf-c6dc-4366-b162-92195f128815
10,methods10," Allergen Assessment  For each of the 297 dishes, the following 14 most common food allergens that should be declared according to European Regulation 1169/2011 [16] were identified taking into account the ingredients used and the cooking process: (1) cereals containing gluten, (2) milk, (3) eggs, (4) fish, (5) crustaceans, (6) tree nuts, (7) peanuts, (8) soya, (9) celery, (10) mustard, (11) sesame, (12) sulphites, (13) lupin and (14) molluscs.  2.3.5. Adequacy for Vegetarian and Vegan Diet  According to the ingredients used, vegetarian- and vegan-adapted meals were identified. In particular, plant-based meals not containing animal products were labelled vegetarian, while meals not containing animal products or their derivates were marked vegan [42].  2.3.6. Restaurant Staff Knowledge about the Mediterranean Diet and Food Allergens  Restaurant staff were divided into cooks and waiters, and their knowledge was evaluated according to two topics: Mediterranean diet and food allergens.",d1456013-ef44-470e-818e-ceed6c0e1957
11,methods11," The questionnaires used were adapted from AMed to evaluate Mediterranean diet knowledge [33] and from those designed by McAdams B. et al. to evaluate food allergy knowledge; however, these questionnaires have not been validated [43]. The information collected about the waiters’ knowledge on the Mediterranean diet included the identification of foods adhering to the Mediterranean diet (10 items), and regarding food allergens, the waiters had to identify the following: (1) the presence of food allergens in common traditional meals (14 items), (2) the critical points of food allergen management (13 items), and (3) food allergy and intolerance reactions (20 items). The information collected about the knowledge of kitchen staff about the Mediterranean diet included their identification of (1) foods adhering to the Mediterranean diet (10 items), (2) healthy food (8 items), and (3) the AMed criteria (8 items).",f452cc3f-6e1d-466d-9c24-1889bfb8aa93

Staff knowledge was evaluated on a 10-point scale for the two evaluated themes (Mediterranean diet and food allergens) and for a total knowledge score.  2.4. Additional Data  The following information about the included restaurants’ general characteristics and offered meals were collected: (1) type of restaurant; (2) capacity; (3) location; (4) years in operation; (5) frequency of menu changes over a year; (6) restaurant administration (owner and his/her family, owner and recruited staff, or a recruited manager); (7) type of cuisine; (8) menu labelling; (9) availability of child/daily/weekend menu; (10) number of employees; (11) quality of the foods by purchases cooks and owners (fish, meat, fruit, vegetable, eggs,",60bb1a83-06b9-4570-ac8b-5f4e0c5ddeb7

15,methods15," Results  A total of 61 restaurants were recruited for the present cross-sectional analysis; however, 17 restaurants were excluded before the collection of the baseline data because of problems encountered due to the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 3), restaurant internal problems (n = 6), loss of interest or time to participate (n = 4), and nonresponse (n = 4) (Figure 1). As a result, 44 restaurants were analysed, as shown in Figure 1, and 297 dishes were analysed from 32 restaurants. A total of 47 questionnaires on staff Mediterranean diet and food allergen knowledge were collected from waiters, and 53 were collected from cooks.  3.1. General Characteristics of the Included Restaurants  Of the 44 included restaurants, the majority were urban (68.2%; n = 30) and coastal (18.2%; n = 8), offering dishes from both menus and daily specials (54.5%; n = 24). Restaurants had a medium average size of 134.1 ± 86.8 m2 with 17.7 ± 10.8 tables available to receive 61.7 ± 38.7 customers (Table 1).",07b752b0-7aac-4924-9d5b-16d1bad327c9
16,methods16," Twenty-two of the included restaurants were located in Tarragonès County which has the highest population density, including the cities of Tarragona, Salou and Torredembarra (50.0%); 17 were located in Baix Camp, which is the second most populated county [31], including the cities of Reus, Cambrils, Prades and Vinyols (38.6%); the others were located in different counties of the Tarragona Province with the least population density (Table 1). The restaurants had been open for 13.2 ± 18.9 years, offering the same menus throughout the entire year (25.0%; n = 11) or changing their offered dishes two or more times a year (68.1%; n = 30). Half of the included restaurants were run by the owner and his/her family (50.0%; n = 22) or by the owner with recruited staff (38.6%; n = 17), with an average of 5.4 ± 4.2 employees (Table 1).  The included restaurants reported offerings of Mediterranean cuisine (72.7%; n = 32), traditional cuisine (54.5%; n = 24), Catalan cuisine (43.",1cce7ea0-6a2e-4f9a-8c96-d873ecf49755

None of the restaurants presented nutritional information, such as the traffic light labels, Guideline Daily Amount (GDA)s or healthier choice indicators, on the menu, while 29.5% (n = 13) identified the presence of allergens or gluten-free options, vegan/vegetarian options or traditional dishes prepared using local food. Only 29.5% (n = 13) offered children’s menus; on the other hand, 77.3% (n = 34) had a daily menu, and 56.8% (n = 25) had weekend menu offerings (Table 1). The majority of the included restaurants recognized that there were points that could be improved regarding the availability of allergen-adapted options (38.6%; n = 17 of 20 respondents) and menu offerings (29.",449b6818-a5cb-4322-ba97-9b3df9119e47

Meanwhile, the quality of restaurant service (72.7%; n = 32 of 41 respondents) and the quality of gastronomic offerings (63.6%; n = 28 of 41 respondents) were meant to be competitive differences with respect to other restaurants.  A significant positive correlation was observed between restaurateurs who considered their menu to be based on healthy offerings and the total AMed number of criteria fulfilled (ρ = 0.32; p-value = 0.04) [44]. Although the association was weak, when the restaurateur’s perception of the healthiness of the menu was positive, the number of AMed criteria fulfilled was higher.  3.2. General Characteristics of the Included Restaurant Owners and Their Employees  As shown in Table 2, the restaurant owners had an average of 18.0 ± 10.6 years of experience in the catering sector.",8fac8cfb-1417-488d-9976-a5d9395c023a

For instance, an observational study in 2017 found that US restaurant meals exceeded the American Heart Association’s (American Heart Association’s (AHA)) criteria, which indicate good nutritional content in terms of calories, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium [45]. Similarly, another study reported that 25 of 32 restaurants analysed did not meet the criteria of the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey for Restaurants (NEMS-R); the study assessed the factors that contribute to increasing healthy food choices in restaurants, such as the availability of, promotion of and signage about healthy meals on the menu [46].",d9e8e24c-b92e-4fe7-9ec0-6949990d2ed0
30,methods30,"  Although eating outside of the home is a pleasurable event for consumers, especially in Spain, where restaurants serve as a context for social and familiar interaction [47], eating pleasure should not be considered an enemy of health; in this sense, restaurants should offer healthier meals to customers without sacrificing taste [48] and should recognize the role of “food as wellbeing” [49]. Specifically, the present cross-sectional analysis showed that many restaurants do not include whole foods and desserts with no added sugar or based on fresh fruit on their menus. The importance of whole grain consumption is based on the recommended daily consumption of 2–3 servings per day of whole grains (±45 g/day) [50], as well as of fruit and vegetables (≥400 g/day) [51], which has been associated with a lower risk for developing noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes type 2 and metabolic and gastrointestinal disorders [50,51].",2cea74ba-69bf-4c2e-b82b-d8b341765334
31,methods31," However, the consumption of whole grains, fruit and vegetables worldwide still does not meet the recommended guidelines (38.4 g/day, 81.3 g/day and 208.8 g/day are actually consumed, respectively), thus constituting a global public health goal to be reached [52]. For instance, to help customers improve their daily consumption of whole grains and fresh fruits, restaurants should increase the availability of these healthy foods on their menus by directly substituting refined-grain foods with whole-grain foods [53] and serving fruit and vegetables as attractive side dishes or entrees [54]. Actually, a recent study about the changes that occurred in dietary habits of the Spanish population during the COVID-19 confinement revealed an increase in the consumption of Mediterranean diet-related foods such as olive oil, fruits, vegetables and legumes [55], reflecting that people desire to approach healthier dietary behaviours that restaurateurs should take into account.",46b05775-ccf6-4c14-b784-e4f331e1faea
32,methods32," For instance, the closing of restaurant establishments could have improved people’s consumption, pointing out the lack of healthier offerings offered by restaurants.  According to the traffic light nutritional content assessment, the starters were mainly rated green for carbohydrates but did not meet the recommended Guideline Daily Amount (GDA)s for fibre, sodium, energy or total fat. These results confirm the observation regarding unfulfilled AMed criteria, pointing out that restaurants should provide more fruit, vegetables and whole-grain ingredients in first courses. Similarly, the main dishes were high in total fat, saturated fat and sodium, with only 59.1% of the restaurants providing fish, seafoods and lean meat as second courses; the latter strategy would result in lower fat content, as demonstrated by the significant correlation between fulfilment of the AMed criteria and green ratings for fat according to the traffic light system.",fe986e81-5f12-4393-b633-b6d6ea3a20a4
33,methods33," Finally, few desserts were rated green for fibre and sugar since the restaurants did not include fresh fruits or pastries with no added sugars, as observed based on the unfulfilled AMed criteria. Furthermore, the average nutrient content was higher than the recommended Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) values per single portion. Similarly, a Canadian cross-sectional analysis found that sit-down restaurant meals were high in calories, saturated fat and sodium with respect to the recommended daily values and that these contents were even significantly higher than those of fast-food restaurant meals [20]. To decrease caloric content, an effective strategy could be substituting fat and caloric foods with greater portions of vegetables, which improves the healthiness and sustainability of the diet [56].",78415f04-6177-4778-97e0-8c90042a51dd
34,methods34,"  Furthermore, none of the included restaurants presented nutritional information on the menu, such as Guideline Daily Amount (GDA)s and healthy choice indicators or symbols, and the majority of the restaurateurs (79.5%) considered their menus already to offer healthy meals. Previous studies have demonstrated that there is a growing demand for nutritional labels on restaurant menus, especially by consumers between 35 and 65 years of age with healthy lifestyles who frequently eat outside of the home. In this sense, restaurants should be proactive and responsive to the request of an important part of the customer population through the design of menus with nutritional information to encourage healthier choices [57].",282d1db5-aac2-4744-9ee9-02c4c71f8080
35,methods35,"  In relation to the food allergen content, the restaurants included in the present cross-sectional analysis offered different allergen-free options on their menus and considered the availability of appropriate meals for people with food allergies as a point to be improved, but they did not recognize the lack of allergen-free options as a weakness (81.8%). The prevalence of food allergies in Europe relates to cow’s milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanut, tree nuts, fish and shellfish [58]. In particular, although wheat is the main source of food in the world, providing up to 50% of the daily caloric intake in developed and developing countries [59], it is also the main source of gluten, whose disorders already affect the 1.4% of the global population [60].",68731adf-eb21-4a8d-907d-6e9281db31d1
36,methods36," For people who cannot consume foods containing gluten, the possibility to choose gluten-free meals when eating outside the home represents an important factor for their quality of life [61]; thus, restaurateurs should come across to these needs, improving menu offerings’ options and communication [61]. However, as observed from the present cross-sectional analysis, only 29.5% of the restaurants identified food allergens on their menus, and only 9.8% of the offered dishes were allergen-free, despite European Union legislation recommending the disclosure of the 14 most common allergens [16]. On the other hand, 47.8% of the offerings are gluten-free, pointing out that restaurants are starting to take more account of this emerging consumers’ need regarding food allergies.  The assessment of staff knowledge indicated that the waiters scored significantly higher than cooks for knowledge of the Mediterranean diet and total knowledge.",3271bf18-cced-43cb-a443-ad5c42d97caa
37,methods37," On the other hand, concerning food allergen knowledge, both waiters and cooks received a barely passing score (5.8 ± 1.7 and 5.5 ± 1.5, respectively, out of 10 total points), and only 43.1% of the restaurateurs reported attending more than one training course on allergen management. Based on the described experience, although proper training on food safety is provided to restaurant staff, these courses are not always effective and have little impact on overall allergen management since theoretical courses are not combined with appropriate practical demonstrations [62]. However, it is essential to provide efficient training to restaurant staff about food allergy prevention and response, in case of adverse reactions [63], and about celiac disease and gluten-free diet management [64], as cooks still have many knowledge gaps in this area [65]. In the management of food allergens, the restaurants included in the present analysis fulfilled an average of 12.9 ± 2.",eb3eb6a3-c394-412b-9521-31241234dbe5
38,methods38,"8 SMAP criteria out of the 18 total recommendations defined by the Catalan Celiac Association [34], highlighting that restaurants were generally careful to avoid cross-contamination in the kitchen and dining room. However, few restaurants were equipped with tools for exclusive gluten-free preparations (ovens, fryers, etc.) or took special precautions such as providing single-serving dressings for allergic customers and closed containers for salt and spices. Although different studies have demonstrated that shared ovens for the cooking of gluten-free and gluten-containing pizza [66], as well as of kitchen utensils as spoons and knives [67], do not pose a relevant risk when specific requirements are complied, these tools could undergo cumulative contamination throughout the day and involve a higher risk during dinner service [68].",b32ccc63-45b7-44d4-9995-86bd90509d6c
39,methods39," Thus, further precautions should be taken by restaurants for the preparation of allergen-free food to avoid adverse reactions and the endangerment of consumers’ lives [69].  Additionally, few restaurants indicated meals suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets (29.5%) on their menus, and the offerings were very limited (26.9 and 9.8%, respectively). Although restaurants still have limited plant-based meal options, in 2019, 1.5% and 0.5% of the Spanish population reported following a vegetarian or a vegan diet, respectively [70], while in 2020, the sales volume of vegetarian and vegan food products in Spanish supermarkets increased by 20% [71]. Thus, as demonstrated by a recent study, the increase in vegetarian and vegan meal options could have a positive impact both on meal sales and on the improvement of consumers’ sustainable food choices and satisfaction [72].  Finally, few of the included restaurants in this cross-sectional analysis offered child menus (29.",4294f03b-3958-4923-a4e1-6b2efd5b3ef9
40,methods40,"5%), but the majority of them would prepare half-portion meals (88.6%). However, as suggested by previous studies, regarding the offering of half portions or smaller serving sizes of adult dishes to children, restaurants should include healthier options to accustom children to selecting and consuming healthy meals [73,74]. Similarly, as reported by Mueller et al., the improvement of healthy child menus seems to encourage the selection of healthier meals by adults [75].  Based on the present cross-sectional analysis, several recommendations could be proposed to restaurants to increase Mediterranean menu offerings and improve food allergen management (Table S4).",20caf020-0715-43b4-a136-6350872f481b
41,methods41," In particular, when limited resources can be invested in the development of new offerings, as is the case for most independent restaurants that operate with narrower profit margins [13], restaurants should improve the promotion of existing healthy options and encourage consumers to select such offerings through symbols and indicators on menus.  Similarly, regarding food allergen management, according to the present analysis, restaurants should provide more training courses to their staff and provide more information to customers about the presence of food allergens on the menu (Table S4). On the other hand, several positive practices were observed at the included restaurants: the use of extra virgin olive oil for dressing and cooking, which has been associated with many health positive effects due to the high content of oleic acid and bioactive compounds (e.g.",218388b0-57fe-4f4b-bba8-69523190a9e0
42,methods42,", polyphenols) [76], as well as the preference of fresh seasonable and traditional fruit and vegetables, which contribute to a sustainable diet [77,78] (Table S4).  Several notable limitations were encountered in the present cross-sectional analysis. First, there were difficulties experienced during data collection since many restaurants did not respond or withdrew from the study before the beginning of data collection. Second, the present cross-sectional study occurred in the midst of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, limiting the participation and inclusion of restaurants in the study, many of which closed during the pandemic. Third, due to the pandemic, the restaurant industry has adapted its offerings according to national dispositions, so the current data could differ from the presented analysis.",71e83544-05ac-4a4e-9041-402cea8b4132
43,methods43," Fourth, since the majority of the included restaurants in the present study were urban, the inclusion of more rural and coastal restaurants in the same proportion would homogenize the results more, making them more representative of the province of Tarragona. Fifth, data collection methods are validated in our local area, being designed and developed by Catalan entities for local realities. However, the use of these data collection methods limited the comparison among international studies. Finally, some restaurant information was lost due restaurants not completing the questionnaires or not providing all the information requested.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, the restaurants did not meet all of the AMed and SMAP criteria. An increase in fibre and a decrease in saturated fat content are needed to improve the nutritional quality of dishes and the consumers’ adherence to healthy diets.",47a0fe1c-00f6-440b-ab11-30113ee1b268
44,methods44," Additionally, for restaurant staff, training courses on food allergens should be considered to improve the allergen management in restaurants. Furthermore, more information should be provided to customers on menus about the presence of food allergens, healthier food choices and vegetarian and vegan options.
