0,background0,"Coronary artery disease (coronary artery disease (CAD)) is a common term for the buildup of the plaque in the heart’s arteries that could lead to heart attack. It remains the leading cause of death in different countries in the world. Altered cholesterol metabolism and pro-inflammatory mechanisms have been associated with the development of atherosclerotic plaques [1].  In addition to dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, which are risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis [2], fatty acid metabolic abnormalities became also an important risk factor. The severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) is evaluated by a Gensini score (GS) [3], which became the standard score reflecting the vascular severity of coronary lesions.  The relation between diet and coronary artery disease (CAD) has been studied intensively for nearly a century and FA lipotoxicity has gradually became a new research point.",558fa5b1-be97-4df9-b42c-d08328d94a2d
1,background1," Dietary fat plays an important role in heart disease by affecting atherogenesis, thrombosis, and coronary infarction [4].  FA are classified as saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)), monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)), and n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFA) (n-3 PUFA). All these fatty acids are known to have different effects. A high intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA) is now considered to be a positive risk factor for coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) which accelerates atherogenesis, whereas monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and PUFA generally reduce coronary artery disease (CAD) by reducing plasma lipids [5].",3f7ffc89-c95b-4865-ad67-3369e9b07100
2,background2," It was also proved that a low consumption of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and a proportionally higher intake of n-6 PUFAs, were associated with a significant reduction of coronary artery disease (CAD) [5], and that n-3 PUFA had a preventive effect on coronary artery disease (CAD) by modulating eicosanoid synthesis and thus may have potential for the amelioration of atherogenesis and thrombosis.  Several studies have reported an inverse relation between linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) concentration and risk of atherosclerosis showing its role to reduce cardiovascular risk [6]. Dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) can also prevent acute coronary syndrome, and heart failure [7]. The concentration of plasma FA is influenced not only by dietary intake but also by the endogenous metabolism of FA and genetic variation [8].",2b2fa169-eb2b-477f-ade9-ae8990f1f6a6
3,background3,"  In humans, there are three key enzymes in FA metabolism which are stearoyl-CoA desaturases (stearoyl CoA desaturases (SCD)), known as delta-9-desaturase (D9D), catalyzing the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA); delta-5-desaturase (D5D) and delta- 6-desaturase (D6D) catalyzing the endogenous synthesis of long-chain unsaturated FAs. Recently D9D has been found as an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease [9].  These enzymes play a crucial role in the mediation and modulation of metabolic functions and physical properties of the cell [10]. FA ratios used as surrogate measures of desaturase activities might be as important for metabolic changes as individual FAs which have been related to metabolic diseases and coronary artery disease (CAD) [11].  Our study aims to evaluate the relation between dietary fat biomarkers, desaturase indexes, and coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Tunisian population. ",77a4f654-1257-424b-bc33-1eeb19fdb4f8
4,methods0,"Patients A total of 150 Tunisian patients consulting for coronary disorders were recruited from F. Bourguiba University Hospital (Monastir, Tunisia), and were clinically examined by coronary angiography at the department of Cardiology. A GS was calculated for all these patients in order to estimate the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). According to angiographic data, the patients were divided into two subgroups: 111 Tunisian patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (80 men; 31 women) and 39 Tunisian patients without coronary artery disease (CAD) but with potential cardiovascular risk factors (16 men, 23 women).  Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), which have at least 50% obstruction in at least one coronary artery, have a clinical history of unstable angina, previous acute coronary syndromes with or without persistent ST-segment elevation in addition to the presence of several risk factors for cardiovascular disease.",1ff8fb1b-0df9-4e3e-b32d-f715eab19d6d

Major requirements for enrolment in all patients were: absence of infectious or acute/ chronic inflammatory diseases, known malignancy, absence of acute/chronic renal failure, or hepatic failure, percutaneous coronary intervention and cerebrovascular accident. All controls were recruited at several diabetes screening days. Among these people none had any cardiovascular risk factors (no hypertension, no diabetes, no obesity, no hyperlipidemia, no family history except smoking and menopause with a reduced numbers and no medication use). Thereafter, blood samples were collected from all these fasting people and analysis of biochemical parameters, as mentioned in our paper, was made.

Blood sample preparation Fasting blood samples were collected from all participants and all analysis were assayed in plasma. Blood samples were collected into EDTA tube then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Plasma was collected and stored at −80 °C until biochemical analysis.  Plasma glucose concentration was evaluated using an enzymatic kit (glucose oxidase, Randox, Antrim, UK), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by an exchange microcolumn chromatographic procedure (Biosystems, Barcelona, Spain), lipid parameters were determined as described previously by Smaoui et al.

These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the relevant protein in the sample. The results were evaluated by comparison with a standard of a known concentration.  Coronary angiographic data and Gensini score All coronary angiography results were interpreted for the presence, extent and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) by two experienced interventional cardiologists. Patients were classified into coronary artery disease (CAD) and non coronary artery disease (CAD) patients according to angiographic results (≥ 50% obstruction in ≥1 coronary artery).",d9213575-2856-465f-89dd-573c6463275c
9,methods5," GS was used to assess the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD): it grades narrowing of the lumen of the coronary artery and scores it as 1 for 1%–25% narrowing, 2 for 26%–50% narrowing, 4 for 51%–75%, 8 for 76%–90%, 16 for 91%–99% and 32 for a completely occluded artery. This score was then multiplied by a factor according to the importance of the coronary artery. The multiplication factor for a left main stem (left main stem (LMS)) lesion was 5. It is 2.5 for proximal left anterior descending artery (left anterior descending artery (LAD)) and proximal circumflex artery (CX) lesions, 1.5 for a mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) lesion, and 1 for distal left anterior descending artery (LAD), mid/distal CX and right coronary artery lesions. The multiplication factor for any other branch is 0.5. The points were then added and the total Gensini score of each patient was calculated. The severity of disease was expressed as the sum of the scores for the individual lesions [1].",3d771ee1-2bcf-4e95-9c44-6e3ae2d24ce9
10,methods6,"  Fatty acid profile analysis Plasma FA were analyzed as fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by gas chromatography analysis. FA were extracted from plasma as previously described by Folch et al. with slight modifications [13]. Individual FAMEs were separated and quantified by gas chromatography using a Model 5890 Series II instrument (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a fused silica capillary column SP-2560 (100 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., and 0.2-μm film thickness) (with heptadecanoic acid, 17:0, used as the internal standard). 1 μL of each sample was injected into the gas chromatography system.  The initial oven temperature was programmed to 140 °C for 5 min. Then, it increase to 240 °C at a rate of 4 °C / min. The injector and detector temperatures were 260 °C.  FAMEs were identified by comparing their retention times with those of individual standards used in mixture (Supelco 37 Component FAME Mix, Palo Alto, USA).",6f2de3c4-c6db-4f47-8687-69cda0e616a2

25,discussion0,"Atherosclerosis is one of the major events leading to coronary artery disease (CAD) development. Among the various factors leading to atherosclerosis, major risk factors are high cholesterol level, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus [15]. Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). It is strongly associated with the incidence, development of atherosclerosis and vascular severity [16]. Alterations of lipid profile, disturbed FAs metabolism and inflammation can promote lipotoxicity.  In order to evaluate the lipid related risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) development, major guidelines have proposed the diagnostic utility of LDL-C, TG, and lipid ratios such as TC/HDL-C, TG/ HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C [17].",a26ba134-6d00-4e5a-8755-9b98dd8d4f99

31,discussion6," These results highlight the Mediterranean diet as the food consumption patterns of the Tunisian population which is generally defined as rich in fruits, vegetables, and cereals, with relatively low intakes of meat, and olive oil as the main source of added fat. It has been suggested that this diet reduce coronary events by decreasing stearic acid intake [28].  This diet is characterized by a high intake of carbohydrates covering 51 to 56% of total calorie intake and a relatively low consumption of fat (30 to 37%) of total energy intake with only 10% are saturated AG. This restriction of saturated fat has the advantage of reducing dietary intake of cholesterol below 300 mg / day as usually provided by the same food. This diet is also rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (> 50% of fat intake) contained mainly in olive oil, an essential component of the Mediterranean diet [29].",97ce3391-81cf-43b5-a7f0-680539d78ccf
32,discussion7,"  In addition, a significant decrease of total PUFA, PUFA n-6 and especially linoleic acid (LA) was observed in the two groups of patients. Different studies proved that higher intake of PUFA n-6 reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) [30, 31] and showed that LA which is the predominant dietary n-6 PUFA have blood cholesterol benefits [25], and that higher dietary PUFA (predominantly LA) is associated with lower coronary artery disease (CAD) risk in prospective cohort studies [5].  Furthermore, in the same class of PUFA n-6, we observed, a significant increase of γ -linolenic acid (GLA), arachidonic acid (AA) and a slight increase of dihomo-γ-linoleinc acid (dihomo γ linoleinc acid (DGLA)) in coronary artery disease (CAD) and non-coronary artery disease (CAD) patients (p < 0.001) compared to controls. This increase may be one of the reasons for the development of atherosclerotic plaques.",579d108b-cde1-45a7-8083-be9e2e397e45
33,discussion8," This may be due to the important role played by AA as a direct precursor of strong inflammatory eicosanoids. However the impact of n-6 PUFA on health especially coronary artery disease (CAD), including GLA, dihomo γ linoleinc acid (DGLA), and AA, remains poorly established.  The study of Sayantani et al. was the only study showing that dietary GLA feeding resulted in significant decrease in serum TG and very low density lipoprotein (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)) cholesterol in addition to the significant increase in HDL-C [32].  In addition, Horrobin has pointed out that low dihomo γ linoleinc acid (DGLA) levels may be strong markers of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk [33]. Furthermore, some studies underlined that increased serum levels of n-3 PUFAs, associated with a decreased incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality in older patients [34].",0cca4eee-19f2-4cef-92fd-6886bb273453
34,discussion9,"  Moreover, as expected, negative correlations were found between different FA (total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), PUFA n-3, Total PUFA, GLA, dihomo γ linoleinc acid (DGLA) and DHA) and GS. In addition, the other important observation was the positive association of GS with stearic and erucic acid which was known to cause cardiac lipidosis [32]. Accordingly, our results leading us to state that the GS can be also appropriate to evaluate the metabolic disorder related to FA.  The PUFA profile in plasma and erythrocytes does not only reflect dietary intake, but is also strongly dependent the endogenous metabolism of PUFAs. In fact, an increase in the index of cell membrane viscosity (saturated fatty acids (SFA)/UFA) was found in our study. Changes in membrane viscosity, are known to be associated with the alteration in physiological process, and has been associated with disease states. They are also known as good indicators of cell viability [35].",444f3678-52d8-4b82-8078-9ab68f77fc01
35,discussion10," Furthermore, membrane viscosity increases have been associated with the development of atherosclerosis, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia [36].  Moreover, the decrease of total UFA level in non coronary artery disease (CAD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) group seem to be associated with the alteration in membrane fluidity, because these changes have been suggested to decrease the membrane fluidity [37].  In addition to the alteration of different FA, higher elongation index and modifications of ∆5, ∆6 and ∆9 desaturation indexes were also observed supporting modifications of FA metabolism. In fact, we found that three desaturase activities (D9D, D5D and D6D) were associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in Tunisian population.",5309deaf-d2ed-467f-81be-85dbfcf0d63d
36,discussion11," The essential FA such as LA (18:2 n-6) and ALA (18:3 n-3), which are important constituents of cell membranes and influence both inflammatory and atherosclerotic processes are metabolized to AA (20:4 n-6) and EPA (20:5 n-3), respectively, by D5D and D6D desaturases [2]. Since most of the products of the AA pathway have pro-inflammatory effects, increased D5D and D6D activity in the n-6 pathway may promote systemic inflammation and increase the risk of atherosclerosis [7]. stearoyl CoA desaturases (SCD) activities, both D9D-16 and D9D-18, were significantly higher in both groups of patients (with or without coronary artery disease (CAD)) than control subjects, and the main product, 16:0, was also increased in the two groups. Our results are consistent with the study of Si-Wei Li et al. performed on a Chinese Han population [38].",fa2729c1-26a6-4155-abf5-55279e7c3dcb
37,discussion12,"  This result was in correlation also with a previous report where an elevation of stearoyl CoA desaturases (SCD) activity was considered as an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk factors [7]. The Studies of Sampat [39] and Lelliott [40] proposed that there is an association of stearoyl CoA desaturases (SCD) activity with an increase of lipogenesis and a lipotoxic mechanisms resulting of an ectopic fat deposition and insulin resistance.  A lower level of LA was observed in non-coronary artery disease (CAD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) patients as compared to control group supported the study of Warensjo [9] which showed that the major influencing factor on arterial stiffness was LA. A higher D6D activity (presented by the ratio 20:4 n-6/18:2 n-6), was observed in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). According to the study of Martinelli et al.",1224929e-3979-4ef5-878e-c528765285a3
38,discussion13," [41] an increase of this ratio was also observed and was considered as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) confirming our results.  In different cases the modification of FA proportions and alteration of D5D, D6D and D9D activities can result from genetic variants of these enzymes genes. Various studies have shown a big association between plasma PUFAs and FADS gene polymorphisms [42, 43]. The activity of D5D and D6D is also modulated by dietary FA intake, and the level of FAs in the tissues [44]. Furthermore, D9D has also recently been demonstrated as an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease [9].  Conclusions In summary, the alterations of lipid profile in coronary artery disease (CAD) reported in our study showed that individual lipid indexes have a different and important informative value for detecting the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD).",a15ad8fd-9268-4345-9459-1d4ccdd8195e
39,discussion14," We showed that saturated and unsaturated n-6 and n-3 fatty acids are important determinants of differences in population rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence.  As far as, the analysis of coronary artery disease (CAD) severity, assessed using the GS, a significant positive association with mean glucose level, and a significant negative association with mean serum HDL-C level in the two groups of patients (non- coronary artery disease (CAD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) group) proved that GS is a good indicator to evaluate glycemic and cholesterol disorders associated with HDL-C which is an important factor of coronary artery disease (CAD) and contribute to the vascular severity.  In the relation with some FA and classes of FA, as expected, a negative association was found, between GS and total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), PUFA n-3, total PUFA, GLA, dihomo γ linoleinc acid (DGLA) and DHA in addition to the positive association with stearic and erucic acid.",65d8d28c-f832-4923-8519-a26b9d7a2210
40,discussion15,"  Our data clearly establish that, GS might be a good indicator to evaluate FA metabolic disorders, glycemic and cholesterol disorders associated with HDL-C.  In our study we proved well that although that Tunisian population appears to follow the Mediterranean diet, coronary artery disease (CAD) patients have an alteration of lipid profile which might be largely due not only to the dietary intake but also to the endogenous metabolism of FAs.  Thus, a comprehensive new strategy to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality should include primarily a cardioprotective diet. The reduction of hyperlipemia and lipid metabolism alteration by appropriate dietary measures is possible. Above all, to this day, no cholesterol-lowering drug has demonstrated to have an effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, without the involvement of dietary measures.",10741a50-a729-4df5-9d93-8b6d97edfee4
41,discussion16,"  However, the requirement does not limited to this diet, and to the adding lipid-lowering drug but other measures on lifestyle, such as physical activity and smoking cessation which have a favorable effect on dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk, should be taken.  However, several limitations merit careful considerations. Despite the differences across studies, the association of plasma fatty acid alteration with the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) lesions has been clearly demonstrated and warrant more clinical studies should be conducted to confirm their clinical applications.  Although our cohort is small, we find significant results; we envisage a prospective study with a larger number of patients. Further research, particularly longitudinal studies, are needed to confirm this hypothesis which opens new perspective for a better understanding of the physiopathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD).",4822446b-6a9b-43a2-b5f6-658eb0cfe791
