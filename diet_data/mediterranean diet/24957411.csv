1,methods1," Animals Six-week-old male Wistar rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Barcelona, Spain) and acclimated for at least one week before the start of the experiment, in authorized animal facilities of the Life and Health Sciences Research Institute from University of Minho. During experiments animals had ad libitum access to food and tap water and were maintained under controlled conditions of temperature (20 ± 2°C) and humidity (55 ± 10%), with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Animals were kept in accordance with the NIH guidelines for the experimental use and care of laboratory animals and handled by authorized investigators by the Direcção Geral de Veterinária, Portugal. The experiment was approved by university's ethics committee that follows NIH guidelines (NIH Publication number 80-23, revised 1978) for use and care of laboratory animals.  2.3. Experimental Design Male rats were divided into two distinct groups and fed a L7G supplemented diet and control diet.",43fcb7bb-ab0d-4802-8899-a6b74c648205
2,methods2," In L7G supplemented diet group, rats receive 2 mg of L7G per kg of animal body weight mixed in a small piece of food, once a day, for 7 consecutive days; control group received the control diet. The amount of L7G administered was based on human luteolin intake estimations by Hertog and collaborators in 1993 [39]. Supplementation with L7G did not alter animal's body weight or food and beverage consumption when compared to control group. At the end of experiment, animals were sacrificed by decapitation. Liver samples were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80°C until further analysis.  2.4. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-Time PCR Total RNA was isolated from frozen liver samples using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA quantification was performed using NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrometer, and its purity was confirmed by A260/A280 ratio.",09f9855a-aab8-44be-9114-ee73d4c03913
3,methods3," Conversion of RNA into cDNA was performed using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) following the producer's suggested protocol. Prior to gene expression analysis, the integrity of cDNA was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis.  Quantitative gene expression analysis was performed using SYBR Green technology (SsoFast EvaGreen supermix) and CFX96 real-time system from Bio-Rad. Samples were amplified using the following conditions: an initial denaturation step of 3 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 95°C and 30 s at 60°C. The primers used were manufactured by STAB VIDA, Lda (Caparica, Portugal) and sequences are presented in Table 2.  Each assay included a relative standard curve constructed from serial dilutions of cDNA from control samples. Target genes' transcript levels were all normalized to β-actin mRNA levels and expression values in the control group were set to 1.  2.5. Liver Homogenates A small amount of liver was homogenized in cold lysis buffer (0.",4544876a-9e3a-4391-9e3b-d7b798316066
4,methods4,"5% NP-40 in 50 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl2, and 2 mM EDTA) supplemented before use with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/mL aprotinin and 20 mM NaF, and 20 mM Na3VO4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10000 ×g at 4°C for 10 min and the supernatant collected. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instructions using BSA as standard. Samples were kept at −80°C for further analysis.  2.6. Western Blot Analysis Proteins in each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TPBS (0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4) and then washed in TPBS and incubated overnight with primary antibody.",0b9bfca1-7407-4aca-a8b1-b78eaa699103
5,methods5," After washing with TPBS, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody and immunoreactive bands were detected using the Immobilon solutions (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) under an imaging densitometer (ChemiDoc XRS from Bio-Rad). Band area intensity was quantified using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). β-actin was used as loading control.  2.7. HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) Activity In Vitro Assay The in vitro effect of L7G at 10, 30, and 100 μM on HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) enzyme activity was determined using a HMG-CoA reductase assay kit from Sigma-Aldrich, as recommended by manufacturers. L7G was dissolved in DMSO (final concentration in the assays of 0.5% (v/v)); DMSO was used as control and pravastatin, a commercial statin, at 0.5 μM was used as a positive control.  2.8. Statistical Analysis Data are presented as means ± SEM. For statistical analysis GraphPAD Prism 5.0 software (San Diego, CA, USA) was used.",56ee69d6-67be-4ef9-9556-b65972ef0aa3
6,methods6," Student's t-test was utilized to compare differences between control and L7G treatment. P values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant.  3. Results and Discussion Diets rich in fruits and vegetables have long been associated with health benefits attributed at least in part to the high antioxidant levels in these diets. Flavonoids are important dietary antioxidants but may exert their health improving benefits by mechanisms other than by conferring increased antioxidant defense.  In previous studies, we have described the beneficial effects of a luteolin-7-glucoside (L7G) rich herbal tea prepared from the aromatic plant Salvia officinalis (SO) on human plasma lipoproteins [40]. The decrease in total and LDL cholesterol observed in humans was significant and similar to the effects of L7G on plasma lipoproteins of L7G fed rats [31]. Additionally, SO showed metformin-like effects in rat hepatocyte primary cultures [41].",2cf144b3-aff9-421e-9a19-27c3715ab0ed
7,methods7,"  Overall these previous data suggested that L7G, the major flavone constituent in SO but also abundant in other herbs and plant foods (Table 1), might help to regulate liver lipid metabolism and help in the dietary control of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and other metabolic diseases.  In the present study we analyzed the effects of the flavone luteolin in its naturally more abundant glycosylated form, L7G, on the modulation of regulators of liver lipid metabolism in vivo.  Rats were fed a diet supplemented with L7G (2 mg/kg body weight) for 1 week. The introduction of this flavone in the diet was well tolerated and no changes in animal or liver weight were found. The effects of L7G on hepatic lipid metabolism were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (PPAR-α and CPT-1), lipid synthesis (sterol response elements (SRE)BP-1), and cholesterol metabolism (sterol response elements (SRE)BP-2, HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR), and LDLr).",4183233f-9ab2-4385-9f47-762f580a724f
8,methods8," fatty acid synthase (FAS) protein levels were analyzed by western blot. Livers of L7G treated animals showed significantly increased (1.9-fold) mRNA levels of PPAR-α and of its target gene, CPT-1 (1.8-fold) (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). Only a slight decrease in sterol response elements (SRE)BP-1 expression was detected and no effect seemed to be present on fatty acid synthase (FAS) protein levels (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)).  Taken together our data indicates an increased β-oxidation capacity in the liver in response to dietary L7G without significant effects on lipogenesis. L7G's effect on activation of PPAR-α suggests a fibrate-like mechanism of action. Fibrates are pharmaceutical drugs used to treat dyslipidemia and are known PPAR-α ligands (activators). Their use has also been suggested in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [42]. Fibrates seem to improve some but not all features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with the disease.",3e1b1707-d819-4e01-9bc3-0bdeb81585b9
9,methods9," Our data suggests that L7G, as a dietary constituent, tends to decrease liver lipid deposition and might be useful in the prevention of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although further studies are required to verify this possibility.  The hepatic expression of sterol response elements (SRE)BP-2 and of its target gene LDLr was not significantly changed by L7G (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)). The expression of HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) was, however, significantly decreased in the L7G treated group (Figure 6(c)). HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR), another target of sterol response elements (SRE)BP-2, is the rate limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis and its decreased expression is in agreement with the previously observed decrease in total plasma cholesterol and LDL lipoprotein levels [31].",b4dd29ca-7b42-4d54-9099-8fc3e72e4340
10,methods10," The observed decreased expression of sterol response elements (SRE)BP-2 dependent HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) suggests decreased cholesterol synthesis by an alternative mechanism to that of statins that inhibit the enzyme's activity. The direct effect of L7G on HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) activity was tested in vitro (Figure 7) and the results show that L7G is not a good inhibitor of this enzyme at physiologically relevant concentrations, when compared to pravastatin.  Interestingly, both statins and the combination of statins and fibrates have been shown to be useful in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [42–44]. This combination of effects induced by L7G alone suggests that L7G rich diets may be useful in the control of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and other metabolic diseases. With regard to the effects on lipoproteins of animals fed a diet supplemented with L7G where a significant decrease in LDL (39.5%) and total cholesterol (29.",02dc3d39-fc60-47a4-b8aa-0d4d50121722
11,methods11,"2%) was observed and in humans where the herbal tea of Salvia officinalis also significantly improved plasma lipid profile, reducing LDL (by 12.4%) and increasing HDL (by 50.6%) [31, 40], it seems that L7G is a major active compound capable of regulating liver lipid metabolism and producing beneficial effects against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and CVD.  Importantly, the liver of animals fed the L7G supplemented diet did not show increases in JNK or cleaved caspase-3 levels (data not shown). Hepatic cell degeneration due to increased apoptosis is a feature of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mediated by oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and activation of the JNK signaling pathway [45–47]. JNK activation is also involved in insulin resistance [48]. Our results show that L7G does not induce activation of the JNK pathway or increase liver apoptosis. These pathways were, however, not originally increased in our experimental model where healthy animals were used.",3cf858e9-3678-4b33-9dee-2800a16326ae
12,methods12,"  4. Conclusions In addition to its well-known antioxidant properties, the dietary flavone L7G promotes liver lipolysis through induction of PPAR-α and CPT-1 expression. L7G also decreases HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) expression thereby decreasing cholesterol synthesis and contributing to lower total and LDL cholesterol levels. This combination of effects induced by L7G suggests that L7G rich diets may be useful in the control of both nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and CVD. ",3e0cb2bb-7c94-4bcb-b002-4a17782aa6db
