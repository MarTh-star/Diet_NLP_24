0,introduction0,"Breast cancer is the leading form of cancer diagnosed in women (1, 2). Excess adiposity and dietary habits occupy a prominent position among the most relevant risk factors of breast cancer (3–5). Increasing scientific evidence demonstrates that environmental factors modulate the expression of genes by regulating epigenetic mechanisms (6, 7). Therefore, the effect of excess body weight and dietary factors on the promotion of breast cancer may be mediated by epigenetic regulation (8).  Our previous studies have recently evaluated the associations between the body mass and DNA methylation in obesity-related diseases (9–12). In the context of breast cancer, an epigenetic signature of obesity-related breast cancer has been identified in breast tumor biopsies, being ZNF577 the most represented gene (10).",2924def6-cb64-4c1a-8614-0c8eba9d3e2e
1,introduction1,"  The functional role of ZNF577 is unknown; however, some members of the zinc finger proteins (ZNFs) family, which regulate gene transcription, have been found to be often hypermethylated and silenced in different types of tumors, suggesting that it may represent a commonly disrupted epigenetic pathway in cancer progression (13). In a metabolic and nutritional context, family members of the ZNFs have been associated with adipogenesis (14–16), type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance (17, 18), the regulation of hepatic lipogenesis (19, 20), and in the control of muscle function (21). Moreover, the expression of some ZNFs is regulated by nutritional status such as fasting (22) or under a high-fat diet (23, 24). Recently it was observed that the consumption of fruit and vegetables concentrates modulate the expression of a ZNFs gene in overweight/obese subjects (25).",86d76b3e-79ab-42b8-960e-7f9e17df95e1
2,introduction2," However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have evaluated the effect of food consumption on the regulation of the expression of genes encoding ZNFs in humans.  Elucidating potential effect of adiposity and dietary patterns on the epigenetic regulation of breast cancer may lead to a better understanding of this disease. Epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and considering that obesity is a risk factor of breast cancer, changes of diet or body weight might reduce the risk of disease remodelating epigenetic marks. This is especially important as the global prevalence of obesity continues to rise (26, 27). In the area of nutrigenomics/nutriepigenomics, recently published studies have provided evidence of the suitability of studying DNA methylation in the blood leukocytes (11, 28–37).",9c679608-2e0c-4808-8c97-c3064b40844d
3,introduction3,"  In this study we evaluate the methylation levels of ZNF577 because it was among the genes of the episignature of obesity-related breast cancer previously identified (10) and it could be a potential player in the link between obesity and breast cancer. Therefore, this study was first aimed to evaluate the capacity of circulating leukocytes to reflect the DNA methylation pattern of ZNF577 in the breast tumor tissue. Furthermore, this study also aimed to assess the relationship between the adherence to the Mediterranean diet and effects of its specific constituents on the methylation and expression pattern of ZNF577.  Subjects and Methods Study Participants A total of 101 women newly diagnosed with histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer during 2010–2011 were included from the Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela (Compostela (CHUS)).",a28093f2-2200-45b7-a9ff-58dd7a73195a
4,introduction4," Patients were excluded if they had other disease different of breast cancer such as cardiovascular, renal or infectious disease. Among these patients, samples, complete clinical data and information on dietary habits were obtained for 90 women, and they were included in this study. Leukocytes were obtained from blood samples in the 90 women. Moreover, paired samples from breast tumor tissue biopsies were obtained in 8 breast cancer women with obesity (n = 3 premenopausal women and n = 5 postmenopausal women). Breast cancer human paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks were obtained from the Biobank of the Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela (Compostela (CHUS)) (PT13/0010/0068), integrated in the Spanish National Biobanks Network and they were processed following standard operating procedures with the appropriate approval of the Ethical and Scientific Committees (ref 2009/076) (10).",215b43d4-80f2-4a1e-bdc9-48a6a28b13ab
5,introduction5,"  Pre-diagnosis body weight, height, age, and menopausal status were retrieved from medical records for all participants in the study. Additionally, a questionnaire on the dietary habits was also obtained along with the blood samples in fasting. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight in kg divided by the squared height in meters and was further categorized using the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) criteria: normal/under-weight, Body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2; overweight, 25 ≤ Body mass index (BMI) < 30 kg/m2; and obese, Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 (38). Then, the overweight and obese patients were classified together as obese (Body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2), and the others as non-obese (Body mass index (BMI) ≤ 25 kg/m2) to evaluate the effect of excess body weight on the methylation patterns.",541bdfa0-05d5-400e-a864-6774c7ff398a
6,introduction6,"  All participants provided informed consent, and the informed consent and the study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the participating institution (Comité Ético de Investigación Clínica, CEIC, de Galicia; Ref:2009/076).  Dietary Assessment The dietary intake of patients was evaluated using a validated self-referenced Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)). The questionnaire included 49 food and beverage items, as well as a small questionnaire about the type of oil used for cooking and dressing. Subjects were asked to specify their frequency of consumption for each food item on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.  Intakes were then converted to daily frequencies and a manual for household measures was used to convert intake frequencies to grams of food intake/day (39).",2c6705e7-487f-4b3a-87f4-514f5af5e033
7,introduction7," Considering the recommendations of food intakes of the Sociedad Española de Nutricion Comunitaria (Sociedad Española de Nutricion Comunitaria (SENC)) (40), two groups were established for each food item (lower consumption than recommended & higher consumption than recommended). Also, with the data obtained in the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed based on 12 questions from the MEDAS-validated questionnaire (41). Under this condition two groups were established. First, patients who secured higher than 7 points from the 12 questions of the MEDAS questionnaire were categorized as the group with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Second, patients who secured 7 points or less were included in the group with low adherence to the Mediterranean diet.  DNA Preparation and Bisulfite Conversion Genomic DNA was isolated from fresh-frozen (FF) leukocytes (n = 90) and paired breast cancer human paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks (n = 8).",ffe8224c-00b8-4c3c-9fb2-af479076b8d4
8,introduction8,"  Genomic DNA was isolated from FF leukocytes by using the MasturePureTM DNA purification kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA), while paraffin samples (FFPE) (10 sections of 14 μm) were processed using the E.Z.N.A. FFPE DNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek), with a xylene wash to remove the paraffin. For each sample of tumor tissue, subsequent sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic confirmation of the presence (>50%) of tumor cells (10). The obtained DNA was treated with RNase A for 1 h at 45°C (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All DNA samples were quantified using the fluorometric method (Quan-iT PicoGreen DsDNA Assay, Life Technologies) and were assessed for purity using a NanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 260/280 and 260/230 ratio measurements.

The potential association between the methylation levels of ZNF577 with anthropometric- and body composition-parameters, and food consumption was evaluated using the Spearman coefficient test. Also, the Spearman coefficient test was performed to evaluate the correlation between ZNF577 methylation levels in leukocytes and in breast tumor tissue biopsy. Multivariate linear regression models were fitted to assess the potential association between the methylation levels of ZNF577 and food consumption, adjusted for Body mass index (BMI) and age.

27,discussion0,"Obesity-related breast cancer has been previously associated with the methylation levels of the promoter region of ZNF577, a specific methylation pattern identified among a potential epi-signature of breast cancer in obese women (10). In the current study, the methylation levels of ZNF577 were measured in the blood leukocytes, to evaluate if the identified methylation levels in breast tumors can be reflected in a non-invasive and easily obtained source of DNA. In this context, it was demonstrated that the methylation levels of ZNF577 were also observed in association with adiposity and menopausal status, and the direction of differences in methylation levels were inverse to that in expression of this gene in the blood leukocytes. Dietary habits are also a risk factor for developing cancer and obesity, as well as both factors were related to the regulation of the methylation profile (44–46).",70bb25ff-209f-40fb-9cd7-429b011ee25f
28,discussion1," Thus, when the methylation levels of ZNF577 were evaluated according to the dietary habits, breast cancer patients who adhered to a Mediterranean diet and who specifically consumed higher amounts of vegetables, legumes, and fish showed the highest levels of methylation in ZNF577, independently of menopausal and obesity status. As far as we know, the current work is the first to evaluate the effect of a food consumption pattern on the methylation level of the ZNF genes in women with breast cancer. Therefore, further studies will be needed to elucidate if the effect of dietary factors on the modulation of methylation levels of ZNF577 is also reflected in the function of this gene, and the role of this regulation on breast cancer progression.  Adherence to Mediterranean diet has been associated with a lower incidence of cancer (47–49).",623e59c8-caa3-4b52-8c23-e2f03fc9a3b8
29,discussion2," In fact, specific compounds contained in foods included in the Mediterranean diet are able to modulate the methylation levels of several genes in the context of disorders like cardiovascular disease (50–52), stroke (51, 53), and cancer (54, 55). In agreement with these previous reports, the adherence to Mediterranean diet has been related to higher methylation levels of ZNF577. When the association between methylation levels of ZNF577 were evaluated according to the consumption of specific foods included in the Mediterranean diet, the highest methylation levels of ZNF577 were shown in the breast cancer patients who consumed the recommended amounts of vegetables, legumes, and fish. However, differences were not observed in the ZNF577 methylation profile in association with meat consumption.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (World Health Organization (WHO)-IARC) classified consumption of red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans” (56).",24d6da3f-a6f5-485a-bebc-5ebded82a139
30,discussion3," This classification is based mainly on the evidence found with colon cancer; however, previous studies have observed that a high consumption of red meat has been also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and other types of cancer (57, 58).  Relevantly, the association analysis demonstrated that the consumption of fish was the highest contributor to the modulation of the ZNF577 methylation levels. These results are in agreement with the beneficial effects of fish consumption on the promotion of health. Fish contain bioactive compounds such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 FAs), specially eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) and docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)). These compounds have significant multiple antitumor activities and have been used as immune-nutrients (59, 60). Epigenetic modifications are among the mechanisms by which the fish-related bioactive compounds induce healthy effects.",4763611f-16c3-4d0d-abf7-027793f7b98e
31,discussion4," Differentially methylated CpG sites have been identified in the blood leukocytes from overweight and obese subjects after a 6-week supplementation with n-3 FAs (61) and also after 6 months of n-3 FAs supplementation in patients with Alzheimer's disease (62).  Because Mediterranean diet and fish consumption is a protective factor and obesity is a risk factor of breast cancer, the association between high ZNF577 methylation levels and Mediterranean diet adherence or fish consumption together with obesity and menopausal state found in the current study could be considered counterintuitive and requires further investigation.  The strength and novelty of the current work has been represented by the use of blood cells, since circulating leukocytes constitute an easy and non-invasive tool to obtain nucleic acids in a clinical setting and perform nutrigenomic/nutriepigenomic studies, instead of invasive biopsies of the target tissue.",9397a670-9c10-4914-b953-655137d697e0
32,discussion5," In fact, previous results observed in the biopsies from breast cancer tumors, in association with obesity and menopausal state (10), were similar to the results obtained in leukocytes in the present study. The magnitude of the DNA methylation differences between the groups may be considered small. An explanation may be attributed to the cellular heterogeneity of the sample used for evaluating the methylation levels of a gene in a single cell type. Also, it may be because patients with the same pathology were grouped only according to food consumption patterns based on established recommendations, instead of evaluating the effect of a specific intervention in a longitudinal study. On the other hand, clinical and pathological characteristics of tumors and therapeutic strategies were not used to stratify and explore the population study and these parameters could influence the methylation levels.",148fd102-7183-4503-9647-f5e43f87405b
33,discussion6," However, the clinical characteristics of tumors in the studied cohort were mostly homogeneous with most of tumors were invasive ductal carcinoma in first state, small size, positive RE and PR and negative hercept test. Therefore, the results of the present study are of the foremost relevance because differences in the methylation levels were observed under a narrow range of intergroup differences in the nutritional behavior.  In conclusion, the current work demonstrates that the methylation pattern of ZNF577 previously identified in breast cancer tissue according to the adiposity and menopausal status (10), can be also detected in leukocytes from the peripheral blood. Relevantly, a specific dietary habit such as adherence to Mediterranean diet specifically fish consumption appears to modulate the methylation levels of ZNF577 in blood leukocytes independently of the Body mass index (BMI) and age.",c67a4e55-dc0f-4fc2-91b6-3a99bbf43c4a
34,discussion7," Therefore, ZNF577 may be a biomarker for the effect of environmental factors such as adiposity, age, and diet on breast cancer, and a suitable therapeutic target in precision nutrition and medicine.
