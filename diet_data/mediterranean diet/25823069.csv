0,background0,"Nowadays, ageing process and the related diseases constitute one of the bigger challenges in Western countries. The general increase of lifespan does not go, hand in hand, with the increase of healthy lifespan, the so-called “healthspan”. This constitutes a worldwide problem, in particular due to age-related chronic diseases [1].  It is well known that the pathogenesis of age-related diseases is characterized by a low-grade inflammation. In particular, the visceral adipose tissue is a source of inflammatory mediators produced by adipocytes and infiltrating monocytes [2].  Abdominal obesity with dyslipidaemia, elevated blood pressure and impaired glucose tolerance characterizes metabolic syndrome (MS) that predisposes to the onset of age-related diseases. As many studies demonstrate, a dietary Mediterranean regimen can positively influence these parameters.",5b0e091a-ac95-466c-98d2-a022c04dee5d
1,background1," Large intervention trials showed, in fact, that Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) could prevent and or delay the onset of age-related diseases with a great implication in the health social system [3–7].  The traditional MedDiet is a common dietary pattern, adopted by inhabitants of countries within Mediterranean basin where the olive tree, Olea europaea, is widely cultivated for the production of table olives and oil. They are the essential components of the MedDiet with a very significant economic value. Besides of the economical contribution to national economies, these are important in terms of nutritional value. Extra virgin olive oil (Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) has been claimed to play a key role in the prevention of age-related diseases and in the attainment of longevity.",9515613b-3839-49de-be34-24b5606e7fe8
2,background2," This is due to the high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, likely responsible for the decreased low density lipoprotein levels, and phenolic compounds claimed to play a role as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories [6, 8, 9].  Foods with bioactive molecules can be considered “nutraceuticals”, defined as “Naturally derived bioactive compounds that are found in foods, dietary supplements and herbal products, and have health promoting, disease preventing, or medicinal properties”. The term was coined in 1989 by Stephen De Felice and was born from the conjunction between nutrition and pharmaceutics [10].  As reported in a recent review, table olives are extremely rich sources of polyphenols, especially oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, comprising 1–3 % of the fresh pulp weight. Despite the high levels of hydroxytyrosol in both table olives and Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), in humans its bioavailability was proved only in oil.",804f6035-0ae9-45d9-b138-df84d274b228
3,background3," Accordingly, to the best of our knowledge, there are no human studies on health effects of table olives [11]. However, the amount of polyphenols is strongly influenced by the variety and the geographical origin. Greek Koroneiki have a very high level of them, while the polypenol content of the Spanish Arbequina is low and that of Sicilian Nocellara is medium-high [12]. So, a possible anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effect of these Sicilian olives is conceivable.  The development of strategies aimed at counterbalancing the frailty in the elderly is a major challenge for the medicine of 21st century [1]. As recently reviewed, ageing affects the gut microbiota composition and its influence in immune response. Age-related gut microbiota changes are associated with immunosenescence and inflamm-ageing. Hence, the gut ecosystem shows the potential to become a promising target for strategies able to contribute to the health status of elderly.",b0e50b49-2af6-40f9-ba6c-bfceaacf79ba
4,background4," In this context, the consumption of pro/prebiotics may be useful in both prevention and treatment of age-related pathophysiological conditions, favouring the attainment of longevity [13].  Probiotics are defined as “Live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host”. Lactobacilli (L.) and Bifidobacteria are the most commonly used bacterial probiotics [14]. Nutritional supplementation in aged people might help to maintain good immune-inflammatory responses by re-equilibrating the gut microbiota.  Fermentation is one of the oldest methods to preserve olives. It has applied worldwide for thousands of years. The microbiota of olives during fermentation, that varies somewhat from cultivar to cultivar, has been recently reviewed, showing that L. are the major constituents of Nocellara del Belice olives microbiota [15, 16]. So, a possible probiotic-like effect of these olives is feasible.",9805207a-c37c-4a0a-8dd3-9df8b2f64b70
5,background5,"  The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of green table olives Nocellara del Belice on clinical and biological parameters of healthy individuals at baseline (T0) and after the assumption of 12 olives/day for 30 days (T1) (this amount was chosen to assure the administration of 2x107L./die, see below).  Results and discussion Hematochemical tests At the end of the intervention, all hematochemical parameters did not experienced variations, with the exception of alkaline phosphatase that significantly increased (Table 1).Table 1 The Table shows the arithmetic average values at T0 and T1, the p-value and the variation in percentage (+ indicates an increase of the variable at T1; - a decrease at T1)  Variable	T0 ± SD	T1 ± SD	p-value	%	 Alkaline phosphate (IU/L)	49.95 ± 13.26	53.73 ± 16.81	0.022	+7.57	 Fat mass%	29.70 ± 7.92	28 ± 7.24	0.004	−5.72	 Muscle mass %	66.97 ± 7.62	68.36 ± 6.85	0.003	+2.09	 IL-6 (FI)	31.52 ± 29.37	20.89 ± 11.93	0.027	−33.",f5f294ae-be95-4449-b53a-963ade58472d

This means that a regular consumption of 12 green olives/day for 30 days does not have a detrimental effect on liver and kidney function and on lipid values.  Anthropometric measurements At T1, in analysed subjects the fat mass significantly decreased together to an increase of muscle mass (Table 1). The possible explanation could be linked to the capacity of conjugated linoleic acid (conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)) to reduce the body fat levels [17].",d01b0770-e9c5-4ed2-af21-f414cb7c14e3
7,background7," This molecule is present both in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and table olives, and can also be produced during their digestion. In experimental models, acting as signalling mediators, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)s inhibit lipogenesis, increase fat oxidation, and reduce adipocytes size [18, 19].  Cytokines analyses The serological analysis of the levels of the main pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines was conducted. Although it was not possible to evaluate the absolute concentration of interleukin (IL)-6 because it is too low, a significant variation was measured in the indirect fluorescence (IF). In fact, its levels significantly decreased at the end of the dietary intervention (Table 1).  IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine capable of regulating proliferation, differentiation and activity in a variety of cell types. In particular, it plays a pivotal role in acute phase responses and in the balancing of the pro and anti-inflammatory pathways.",9f5dd3bd-65f3-458e-bcff-95ff2055e240
8,background8," It is involved in impaired lipid metabolism and in the production of triglycerides. Moreover, it decreases lipoprotein lipase activity and monomeric lipoprotein lipase levels in plasma which contributes to increased macrophage uptake of lipids [20]. This datum suggests that a regular consumption of green olives can have anti-inflammatory effects linked to polyphenols, known to have anti-inflammatory properties [6].  Oxidative stress analyses At the end of intervention, the values of malondialdehyde (malondialdehyde (MDA)) significantly decreased (Table 1), while paraoxonase (paraoxonase (PON)) plasma levels and reduced glutathione in the red blood cells were not changed (data not shown). malondialdehyde (MDA) is the main product of the polyunsaturated fatty acids peroxidation and is an important index of oxidative stress [21]. So, its reduction should be linked to the increased assumption of mono-unsatured oleic acid by olives.  Microbiological analyses on feces The amount of L.",f9b62e97-f361-4b15-b4ce-54733fa74644
9,background9,"/g of feces was quantified before and after the intervention. No statistically significant differences were observed, although a trend towards an increased amount of L. was highlighted in some subjects at T1 (data not shown). Thus, we can speculate that a more durable dietary intervention and a bigger sample of people could give more interesting results.  Conclusions The traditional MedDiet is a common dietary pattern that identify a lifestyle and a culture. It was proven that it contributes to better health and quality of life. Concerning its healthy effects, low content of animal protein and low glycaemic index may directly modulate the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 and the mammalian target of rapamycin pathways, known to be involved in ageing, age-related diseases and longevity.",6143d35f-5c3a-45a1-aaff-326ae2d9b30b
10,background10," In addition to the influence on nutrient sensing pathways, many single components of MedDiet are known to have positive effects on health, reducing inflammation, oxidative stress and other important risk factors of age-related diseases [6].  This pilot study demonstrates an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effect of daily consumption of green table olives Nocellara del Belice. Moreover, it is noteworthy the reduction of fat mass with an increase of muscle mass. Although no statistically significant probiotic effect was observed, the positive trend related to L. amount at T1 could represent a starting point for further studies.  It is to note that the study presents limitations. One is strictly related to the intrinsic complexity of human as study model and to the inter/intra-individual variability. These features are more evident in ageing than in younger people. This is the reason why we chose middle age people.",4c3de0d4-9cf2-456b-9567-5f912292f315
11,background11," So, our choice represented the second limitation of the study because we did not analyze the effects of the intervention in elderly. Thirdly, it is necessary to verify these data in a larger sample of individuals to confirm the role of table green olives as nutraceutical foods. Also the duration of the intervention could be inadequate. In fact, we developed a short-term dietary regimen (30 days). This is a good choice in terms of compliance to the study because the more is the time of intervention the more is the drop out effect. But, a long-term dietary intervention could be stronger in terms of variation of analyzed parameters (e.g., L. amount in feces).  However, these new knowledges give an important achievement for the food and farming industry, especially in Sicily, where the olives represent a great potential resource. No approved healthy property and claim exist for them. Therefore, adding such a common product to the class of nutraceuticals could represent a big deal.",2500ffa5-f37d-4dfe-b7be-176f05d43b1d
