1,methods0," Study design  The InCHIANTI study is an ongoing prospective cohort of a representative sample of older adults living in the Chianti geographic area (Tuscany, Italy). It was designed to evaluate factors that influence mobility and disability in late adulthood [21]. Details of the InCHIANTI study have been previously published [21]. Participants were recruited in 1998–2000 and were invited every 3 years to a follow-up visit. The Italian National Institute of Research and Care of Aging Ethical Committee approved the study protocol, and all participants signed an informed participation consent.  The current study was conducted and reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology-Nutritional Epidemiology (STROBE-NUT) guidelines (Additional file 1. Supplementary Table S1, [22]).  Study population  At baseline, 1155 subjects aged ≥65 years agreed to participate, with a participation rate of 91.7%.",a7e04a6a-8920-45c3-97b4-4bc489359ef2
2,methods1," Out of these, participants who had missing data in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (n=16), in any of the selected dietary biomarkers (n=472) or covariates of interest (n=21), were excluded. The major cause of missing data in dietary biomarkers was the failure to complete the baseline 24h urine collection.  Dietary assessment  Habitual dietary intake was assessed at baseline by trained interviewers using the Italian version of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) developed and validated in the European Prospective study into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Italy study [23]. This questionnaire asked how often (daily, week, monthly) the consumption of 198 food and beverages items in the past year, considering its respective portions sizes. Daily intake of energy, macronutrients, and micronutrients was estimated from the dietary questionnaire using a specific software developed for the European Prospective study into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study [24].",25acd6d5-d306-4c77-9ad8-f66de8fa506e
3,methods2," For the current analysis, dietary data were available at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 years of follow-up.  Dietary score of the Mediterranean diet  Adherence to a dietary MD scores (MDS) was computed using an 18-point linear scale that incorporated 9 key components of the diet. Each component was divided into tertiles of intakes, and a score of 0, 1, and 2 was assigned to the first, second, and third tertiles of intake for the 6 components presumed to fit the MD: vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereals, fish, and ratio monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)/saturated fatty acids (SFA). Alcohol was scored as a dichotomous variable, assigning 2 for moderate consumers (range 5–25 g/days for women and 10–50 g/days for men) and 0 for subjects above or below the sex-specific range, including teetotallers. The scoring was inverted for the 2 components presumed to not fit the MD: total meat and dairy products.",1f4ac9ce-dbed-4e89-8b98-664d1af65862
4,methods3," The overall adherence to MD scores (MDS) from dietary intakes (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS)) was calculated for each subject as the sum of the values from each component, which resulted in a score between 0 (lowest adherence) and 18 (highest adherence) [25].  Nutritional biomarker assessment  For this study, the measurement of dietary biomarkers was only available at baseline. Plasma carotenoids were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)). Total carotenoids were calculated as the sum of α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene in micromoles per liter (μmol/L). Within-run and between-run coefficients of variation, respectively, were 7.3% and 9.6% for α-carotene, 4.5% and 5.4% for β-carotene, 2.7% and 3.5% for β-cryptoxanthin, 2.6% and 7.1% for lutein, 6.2% and 6.8% for zeaxanthin, and 7.5% and 7.8% for lycopene [26, 27].",540d9a3d-6799-4975-b900-56959c4cd3e2
5,methods4,"  Selenium concentration (μmol/L) at baseline was measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry with an Analyst 600 with Zeeman background correction (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT). For baseline measurements, the instrument was calibrated daily by using known plasma selenium standards (UTAK Laboratories Inc., Valencia, CA). Within-run and between-run CVs were 3.1% and 7.1%, respectively [28].  Plasma fatty acids (FAs) were measured by gas chromatography (HP-6890, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter, HP-225 from Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Total lipids were extracted from 0.15 mL of the plasma by using the procedure of Folch (1957). A known amount (50 μg) of heptadecanoic acid (C17:0, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to each sample before extraction as an internal standard.",5a85f1bf-ae62-4bef-b9e3-39e5dae38174
6,methods5," Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared through transesterification using Lepage and Roy’s method, modified according to Rodriguez-Palmero et al. (1998). FAMEs were identified by comparison with pure standards (Nu-Chek Prep, Inc., Elysian, MN, USA), and peaks were identified by comparison with standard mixtures of fatty acids. For quantitative and qualitative analysis of fatty acids as methyl esters, calibration curves for FAME (ranging from C14:0 to C24:1) were prepared by adding six increasing amounts of individual FAME standards to the same amount of internal standard (C17:0; 50 μg). The correlation coefficients for the calibration curves of 20 fatty acids were in all cases higher than 0.998 in the range of concentrations studied. The amount of plasma fatty acids (ranging from C14:0 to C24:1) was quantified based on the amount of FAME internal standard (C17:0) that was recovered. The coefficient of variation for all fatty acids was on average 1.6% for intraassay and 3.",f894c71c-60df-454a-a68c-66bc029ad48c

The percentage of values below the limit of detection were 33% for C24:0 (tetracosanoic acid), 14% for C20:0 (eicosanoic acid), 5% for C22:1 n-9 cis (docosenoic acid), and 3% for C22:0 (docosanoic acid). In these cases, samples were assigned with the minimum detectable value (0.15 μM)  Serum vitamin B12 was measured at baseline using by radioligand-binding assay (SimulTrac-SNB Radio- assay; ICN Pharmaceuticals). The minimum detectable concentrations were 75 ng/L for vitamin B12, and the intraassay and interassay CVs were 11% and 12%, respectively [30].  In 24h urine samples, total polyphenol concentration was measured by the Folin-Ciocalteau assay after a solid-phase clean-up which allows the elimination of interfering substances that could react with the F-C assay, as described previously [31]. Total polyphenol concentrations were expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (gallic acid equivalents (GAE)) per 24-h urine.",47521174-965a-4782-b771-11c623528e4a
8,methods7," Phase II resveratrol metabolites were measured by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as previously described [32]. Briefly, 1mL of urine with the internal standard was loaded into a previously equilibrated Oasis (Waters) HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced) solid-phase extraction 96-well plate (30 mg). Urinary resveratrol metabolites were eluted with acidified methanol solution and ethylacetate. After evaporation, samples were reconstituted with 100 μL of the mobile phase and then analyzed by liquid chromatography (PerkinElmer S200) coupled to a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (API3000; AppliedBio-systems). Intra-batch and inter-batch coefficients of variation were less than 10.5% and less than 10.7%, respectively [32]. Both plasma and urinary dietary biomarkers were already validated against dietary intake measurements in the InCHIANTI study [28–31, 33, 34]. In the case of urinary resveratrol, 31% of the samples had values below the limit of detection.",e4e1c791-9484-4d58-b757-94a49676b094
9,methods8," These belonged mostly to teetotallers (56%) and participants who did not consume wine (26%). A zero value was assigned to all these samples.  Biomarker score of the Mediterranean diet  The following dietary biomarkers were considered: total carotenoids (calculated as the sum of α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene), selenium, linoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic (eicosapentaenoic (EPA)) and docosahexaenoic acids (docosahexaenoic acids (DHA)), MUFAs [calculated by summing of the following fatty acids: C14:1 n-9 cis (myristoleic acid), C16:1 n-7 cis (palmitoleic acid), C18:1 n-9 cis (oleic acid), C18:1 n-7 trans (octadecenoic acid), C20:1 n-9 cis (11-eicosenoic), C22:1 n-9 cis (docosenoic acid), and C24:1 n-9 cis (tetracosenoic acid)], SFAs [calculated as the sum of C14:0 (myristic acid), C16:0 (palmitic acid), C18:0 (stearic acid), C20:0 (eicosanoic acid), C22:0 (docosanoic acid), and C24:0 (tetracosanoic acid)], and vitamin B12.",daae1888-c997-491c-95d3-ef8a25992627
10,methods9,"  Similar to the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS), the dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS) was computed using an 18-point linear scale that incorporated a dietary biomarker from 9 key components of the diet. From the available measurements in the InCHIANTI database, we selected those that were suggested in previous literature as a dietary biomarker of the key MD food groups [16, 18, 35–40] and in addition were significantly associated with dietary intake data in the present study (shown in Table 1). Dietary biomarkers for vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereals, fish, and olive oil were ranked and divided by tertiles. A score of 0, 1, and 2 was assigned to the first, second, and third tertiles of dietary biomarker, respectively.",5b2430f1-31cd-47eb-a152-43e5a90a6df4
11,methods10," Resveratrol metabolites as a dietary biomarker of alcohol consumption were scored as a dichotomous variable, assigning 2 for moderate consumers (range of values corresponding to wine consumption; 125–375 g/day for men and 50–250 g/days for women; in the present population 589–14,557 nmol/24h for men and 1–11,125 nmol/24h for women) [39] and 0 for subjects above or below the sex-specific range, including teetotallers. The wine was the major contributor to alcohol intake (88%) in this older Mediterranean population. The scoring was inverted for the SFA and vitamin B12 tertiles, representing meat and dairy products, respectively. Dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS) ranged from 0 to 18, indicating low to high adherence.",43bdb3e0-d079-4a9f-8e22-82c18e210b34

Illumina Infinium HumanHap 550K SNP arrays were used for genotyping of the following single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s: APOE ε4 (using the rs429358 and rs7412 SNPs), rs1421783 MAT2B, rs6997892 WRN, rs10817931 TRIM32, rs2684766 IGF1R, and rs11630259 IGF1R [42]. The parental longevity score was created from the parental age at death or current age (if alive) as described previously [43]. Briefly, a normal curve using a non-linear least square regression was used to determine the modal age (M) of death for each parent.",8bc52c9b-b106-4777-92a6-844fc268efbd
14,methods13," They were then categorized as short-lived if M was less than M− 1 standard deviation (mothers 61–76 years and fathers 46–74 years), intermediate as M± 1 standard deviation (mothers 77–91 years and fathers 75–87 years), and long-lived (mothers: older than 91 years and fathers: older than 87 years).  Outcome assessment  Data on 20-year mortality were collected using the Mortality General Registry maintained by the Tuscany Region, as well as death certificates delivered after participants’ decease to the registry office of the municipality of residence [13]. Cardiovascular mortality, based on the underlying cause of death, was defined as any cardiovascular mortality coded by the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9, codes 390-459). Cancer mortality was defined as any mortality related to known cancer (coded 140 to 239 by the ICD-9).",2fea32d5-925b-40a3-a01b-2861aeeeeefa
15,methods14," Other mortality causes (also coded by ICD-9) included respiratory system diseases; unknown causes; injury and poisoning; nervous system and sense organ diseases; endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, and immunity disorders; mental disorders; digestive system diseases; symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions; infectious and parasitic diseases; blood and blood-forming organ diseases; and musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases. Cases lost during follow-up (i.e., emigration or refusal to participate) were censored using the date of the last contact.  Other main baseline covariates assessment  Covariates were selected a priori on the basis of previously reported associations with both MD and mortality [12, 15, 37]. Trained interviewers administered standardized questionnaires on sociodemographic and lifestyle variables including age, sex, and years of education.",cedf9671-1a95-4ee4-88c2-9ad4f0f42311
16,methods15," Smoking habits were self-reported, and participants were classified into never smokers, former smokers, and current smokers. Physical activity was evaluated using a structured questionnaire specifically developed and validated for the InCHIANTI study. The questionnaire required that the participant provide data on past and current physical activity. The details of the questionnaire have been previously reported [44]. Physical activity was coded into the following categories: inactive or sedentary (physical activity <2 h/week; i.e., walking), light physical activity (2–4 h/week), and moderate-high physical activity (light-intensity activity >4 h/week or moderate-intensity activity 1–2 h/week; i.e., swimming) [44].

18,analysis0," Descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics was presented as mean (standard deviation) for normally distributed variables or median (25th and 75th percentiles) for variables that deviated from the normal distribution. Spearman rank correlation analyses were performed to examine the relations between proposed dietary biomarkers and MD diet food groups and between food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS) and dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS). The final sum of both scores was divided into population tertiles to achieve categories with a similar number of participants in each group. Cut-offs for food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS) tertiles were ≤7, 8–10, and ≥11 and for dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS) tertiles ≤8, 9–10, and ≥11. The squared-weighted Kappa coefficient was calculated as a measure of the agreement between food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS) and dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS) tertiles.",1aef71ab-a4fa-420c-a0cc-b21df05c21ae
19,analysis1," Baseline characteristic comparisons across the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS) and dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS) tertiles were assessed using generalized linear models adjusted for age and sex.  Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the associations between tertiles of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS) or baseline dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS) and all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. The base model was adjusted for age (continuous) and sex. The final model was additionally adjusted for body mass index (BMI) (continuous); years of education (continuous); smoking status (3 categories); physical activity (3 categories); impaired renal function, diabetes mellitus, HT, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, dementia, and Parkinson’s disease (dichotomous); and energy intake (continuous).",5e2e7c3d-36b9-45a2-8365-89a523d06e7f
20,analysis2," Similarly, each component of the dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS) (as tertiles) was individually tested in the fully adjusted model. Tests for linear trends were performed by assigning ordinal scores to the tertiles. For linear dose-response plots, Cox regression models were carried out with dietary biomarker MD scores (MDS) or food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS) as continuous variables using the “rms” R package developed by Frank Harrell [46].

Sensitivity analyses were run after the exclusion of participants who died in the first 2 years of the follow-up, or participants using dietary supplements or lipid-lowering medications. In all Cox models, proportional hazard assumption was tested by visual inspection of the plots based on the Schoenfeld residuals and they were satisfied.  In addition, to better understand genetically predisposed mortality risks, we further adjusted the Cox regression models for SNPs with previously reported associations with mortality [42]: APOE ε4 (using the rs429358 and rs7412 SNPs), rs1421783 MAT2B, rs6997892 WRN, rs10817931 TRIM32, rs2684766 IGF1R, rs11630259 IGF1R, and a parental longevity score.

These findings strongly suggest that a panel of dietary biomarkers may provide a more objective and accurate assessment of the health benefits associated with diet quality in older adults than self-reported questionnaires. This dietary biomarker panel can be used in both epidemiological and clinical research to further investigate the relationships between the adherence to MD and health outcomes.",729717ce-21dc-40b0-954e-baf55577822a
37,discussion1,"  Our results showing a non-significant association between food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS) and all-cause mortality somewhat contrast with previous findings from the European Prospective study into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) [8], MOLI-SANI [7], and healthy aging: a longitudinal study in Europe (healthy aging a longitudinal study in Europe (HALE)) [47] and Women’s Health Initiative (Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)) [48] studies. These differences could be due to the older mean age of our population, the lower number of participants included, the longer follow-up [14years vs. 8.1years (in the European Prospective study into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and MOLI-SANI studies)], the higher proportion of deaths [68% vs. 10–17% (in the European Prospective study into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and MOLI-SANI)], differences on dietary backgrounds when comparing studies from the Mediterranean vs.",e771c555-c754-47a1-8314-131a6902b2da
38,discussion2," non-Mediterranean regions, or on the relatively higher presence of chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline, among other factors. Older age might affect the ability to report food intake using food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which depends on memory, and this could hamper the accurate estimation of the associations between dietary intakes and health outcomes [49]. Moreover, dietary intakes can change over time, and therefore, the association between food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS), measured at baseline, and long-term mortality could be inaccurate. However, the intraclass correlation coefficient of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS) was acceptable across the consecutive examinations (0.49).",fb41fb59-6b61-4984-9983-c36d344e04c7
39,discussion3," Moreover, although the participants were older over the consecutive interviews, we observed minor differences in the adherence to food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS), which was only statistically significant when comparing the first and the last evaluation. The consideration of data from the dietary assessments of the follow-ups showed similar results for overall mortality; but for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, including the dietary data from the follow-ups did show a statistically significant inverse association between food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.  Recently, two metabolomics studies discovered a plasma metabolite panel based on the MD adherence including more than 60 metabolites of which > 60% were lipids (such as phospholipids, glycerolipids, carnitines, and acylcarnitines) [20, 50].",e67bce9a-5bae-4e5f-8580-e15d1d35576a
40,discussion4," Both studies used an a posteriori approach to explore metabolite fingerprints, which were significantly correlated with the MD scores (MDS) adherence from dietary questionnaires. In the present study, we included metabolites derived from the dietary sources, i.e., total polyphenols, resveratrol, or carotenoids, which were not considered in the abovementioned metabolomics analyses. In the study of Li et al. [20], fruits and legumes were only slightly correlated with 7 out of the 67 metabolites that constituted the total score. Therefore, these metabolites may track the biological changes induced by a MD (biomarkers of effect) but may not correlate with the intake of certain major food groups of the MD. Indeed, in both metabolomics studies, high correlations with the intake of fish and seafood, and olive oil were expected, as they were mostly based on lipid metabolites [20, 50].",aa7fb865-58cd-4e6c-9a12-a5d739967a8e
41,discussion5," Future studies with a more comprehensive metabolomic analysis combining endogenous and exogenous metabolites are still warranted. We expect that the inclusion of more dietary biomarkers with higher specificity would improve the assessment of MD adherence and would reflect better its potential health benefits [51]. In our score, total polyphenols, selenium, linolenic acid, and carotenoids were grouped as dietary biomarkers of vegetables, fruits and nuts, legumes and cereals altogether because these dietary biomarkers are present at different concentrations across these highly-heterogenous food groups and one-to-one relationships can not be established. The analysis of interactions allowed us to detect that impaired renal function affected the association between the dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS) and all-cause mortality, probably through its influence in the excretion of urinary dietary biomarkers.",2fe6e63f-3844-4fdd-84df-5aa7fa44e76d
42,discussion6," Further studies are needed to develop more robust adherence scores from dietary biomarker concentrations that may not be affected by impaired renal function.  The present findings on dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS) are in accordance with previous InCHIANTI results showing that polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and total polyphenols inverse associations with overall mortality were only significant using dietary biomarkers but not using dietary questionnaires [13, 14]. Moreover, the metabolite score developed by Li et al. [20] was associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) events independently of the MD scores (MDS) based on the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The explanation of why dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS) was significantly associated with all-cause mortality, while the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS) was not, might be related to the ability of dietary biomarkers to better address the complex diet-health relationship [51].",a4e98f30-46aa-46d3-aaaa-2c66b214f5bd
43,discussion7," Furthermore, a dietary biomarker may better capture dietary exposure accounting for interindividual variations in different age-related changes.  The main strengths of this study is its longitudinal design, long follow-up, and the use of dietary biomarkers that reduce the potential dietary assessment errors of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-based data. We also included repeated measures of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS) in the analysis as older adults are susceptible to change their dietary habits due to various conditions influenced by physiologic, pathologic, and/or psychologic factors [52]. In addition, we used a genetic score and a parental longevity score to better understand the predisposed mortality risks. Last, we used one of the common definitions of MD scores (MDS) [10], facilitating the comparison with results from other studies [53]. However, this investigation also has some limitations.",4b822e9f-7715-4dc6-864a-9c5d783d7794
44,discussion8," Firstly, we only had baseline measurements of the dietary biomarkers, and their stability over time in this cohort is uncertain. However, in other longitudinal studies dietary biomarkers like plasma carotenoids, total SFA, MUFA and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) were reported to be stable, with an intraclass correlation coefficient ranging between 0.50–0.68 over 3 to 15 years apart [54–56]. Taking into consideration that food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-MD scores (MDS) slightly changed across follow-ups, we may assume similar changes for the dietary biomarker MD scores (MDS). Secondly, there are more specific dietary biomarkers for some MD food groups as described in the literature [16, 18, 57–59], but they were not available in our cohort. In the present study, the panel of dietary biomarkers was selected based on a literature search and an a posteriori validation through correlation analyses.",dd49d432-b03f-40b0-9dcd-0032f4fd5827
45,discussion9," However, the existence of multiple food sources affecting the levels of these dietary biomarkers may have reduced the specificity of the present score for the Mediterranean diet. Indeed, the correlation coefficient and level of agreement between the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)- and dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS) was low. Thirdly, although we adjusted our model by several potential confounders, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. Last, our results require confirmation in other populations from different geographical regions.  Conclusions  Adherence to MD assessed by a dietary biomarker panel based on key MD food groups, but not using a traditional food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), was inversely associated with long-term mortality in older adults. The linear dose-response between the dietary biomarker-MD scores (MDS) and mortality further supports its use in long follow-up evaluations to monitor the potential health benefits associated with MD.",16bf4b82-2a30-4a63-ac77-52d8a8b698c5
