0,methods0,"Data will be available on request from the corresponding author, subject to approval by the European Prospective Investigations into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigations into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) Norfolk steering committee.  The current prospective cohort study includes 23 232 voluntary participants from a population-based cohort of 25 639 men and women from European Prospective Investigations into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk, the UK arm of the multicenter European Prospective Investigation into Cancer study (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). The European Prospective Investigations into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk study design and the characteristics of the cohort have been described fully elsewhere.19 Briefly, all people aged between 40 and 79 years registered with 35 collaborating general practice surgeries in the Norfolk area were invited to the study by mail between 1993 and 1997.",e0ed5e0d-b9af-4289-95e1-95bd80e3e5bb
1,methods1," Participants who consented to the study completed a Health and Lifestyle Questionnaire and subsequently attended a health examination. The cohort is representative of a UK population, although current smoking levels were marginally lower than that reported in other UK surveys.19  Baseline Measurements At baseline, participants were asked to complete 7DDs for all foods and drinks consumed.20 Full details on 7DD methodology in addition to the collection of health and lifestyle information and anthropometric and biological measurements are available in the online-only Data Supplement. For the current analyses, we defined the MD using the modified MDS, frequently described as a traditional MD.13 In calculating this score, one point is given for intakes of each protective item in the score at or above the sex-specific median for the study population, and zero is given for amounts below the sex-specific median.",4ebd0a3b-b64d-4f46-aef5-ed7fab163d5d
2,methods2," Protective items are fruit and nuts, vegetables, legumes, cereals (including bread and potatoes), fish, and a higher unsaturated fat:saturated fat ratio. For dairy and meat and eggs, intakes at or above the sex-specific median intake received 0 point; for intakes below the sex-specific median, 1 point was given. Women received 1 point for intakes of alcohol between 5 and 25 g/d (4.4–21.9 U/wk) and men who drank between 10 and 50 g/d (8.8–43.7 U/wk) alcohol received 1 point; otherwise, men and women were given 0 points for other amounts of alcohol. Thus, a range of scores between 0 and 9 was possible.  Outcome Ascertainment Linkage with hospital records and death certificate information determined nonfatal and fatal stroke incidence. Stroke outcome data were available for almost 100% of the participants apart from a few individuals who died abroad (notified by relatives) and for whom we do not have a cause of death. These participants represent 1.4% of deaths within the cohort.",d792d811-72b8-4d0b-80ec-5497cf939459
3,methods3," International Classification of Disease codes ICD-9 430–448/ICD-10, I60-69 were classed as stroke. In the United Kingdom, all individuals have a unique National Health Service ID number, and the National Health Service is used by the whole population. This investigation includes incident strokes during follow-up (FU) until March 31, 2015. This outcome ascertainment method has been validated for stroke in European Prospective Investigations into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) showing high sensitivity and specificity.21  Ethics All participants gave written informed consent to the study. Norfolk District Health Authority Ethics Committee gave ethical approval.  Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 11 (StataCorp. 2009.

4,methods4,"  We compared the baseline characteristics and unadjusted dietary intakes of men and women at baseline using 2 sample t tests with equal variance for continuous data or χ2 tests for categorical data. We also compared the baseline characteristics across sex-specific quartiles of MDS using ANOVA for continuous data or χ2 tests for categorical data.  Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were determined for incident stroke risk in relation to quartiles of the MDS using Cox regression. For these analyses, we report the HRs, stratified by sex, from unadjusted and 3 adjusted models. Model 1: sex, age, body mass index, educational attainment, physical activity, smoking status, material deprivation using the Townsend Index, energy intake, and alcohol intake. Model 2: model 1+baseline serum total cholesterol, baseline myocardial infarction (MI) or diabetes mellitus, and family history of stroke or MI. Model 3: Model 2+systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive use, and aspirin use for >3 months.",7e2c7c70-ae20-446e-bb3b-48eaf4b5210b
5,methods5," We also used Cox regression to examine the HRs for incident stroke comparing participants with intakes above and below the median for individual components of the MDS, with covariates as model 3 above.  To investigate the effect of MD adherence in individuals with different existing cardiovascular risk profiles, we performed further stratified analysis. We calculated the 10-year cardiovascular risk of participants using the traditional Framingham risk score22 and stratified participants into 2 groups: low risk (Framingham risk score below the median) and high risk (Framingham risk score above the median). HRs and 95% CIs were determined for incident stroke risk across quartiles of the MDS within these groups using Cox regression. Models were adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, educational attainment, physical activity, smoking status, material deprivation using Townsend deprivation index, energy intake, alcohol intake, baseline MI, and family history of stroke or MI.",5b104161-fa8e-4b00-8938-65ff351a5779

7,results0,"Of the 23 232 individuals aged 40 to 77 years at baseline (mean: 59.1±9.3 years), 54.5% were women. There were 2009 incident strokes (men n=961 and women n=1048) during FU (mean: 17.0±4.6 years; 395 048 total person-years). At baseline, systolic and diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher in men than in women by 3.6 mm Hg (SE: 0.2) and 3.5 mm Hg (SE: 0.1; P<0.001 for both), respectively. Mean MDS was 4.4 (SD: 1.6) in men and 4.2 (SD: 1.6) in women (P<0.01; Table 1). There was a significant trend for lower prevalence of current smoking and higher physical activity levels by increasing quartiles of MDS for both men and women. In women only, higher adherence to the MDS was also associated with lower age (P<0.01), body mass index (P<0.01), use of antihypertensive medication (P<0.01) and deprivation (P=0.03), and higher education levels (P<0.01; Table II in the online-only Data Supplement).

8,results1," Baseline Characteristics in 23 232 Men and Women Aged 40 to 77 Years in the European Prospective Investigations into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk Cohort  In multivariable analysis (Table 2), in the whole study population, there was a significant inverse trend for reduced stroke risk across increasing quartiles of the MDS (quartile 4 versus quartile 1 HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.94; P-trend <0.01). After stratification by sex, these associations were only apparent in women (quartile 4 versus quartile 1 HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.93; P-trend <0.01). Additionally, moderate MDS (quartile 3 versus quartile 1) was associated with a 20% significant stroke risk reduction in women (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67–0.95; P<0.05) but not in men. Sensitivity analysis with additional adjustment for hormone replacement therapy and menopausal status in women did not markedly change the results (data not shown).

9,results2," Associations Between Baseline MDS and Incident Stroke Risk in 23 232 Men and Women, Aged 40 to 77 Years in the European Prospective Investigations into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk Cohort  As shown in Table 3, we found higher adherence to the MDS to be associated with reduced stroke risk in those participants at high cardiovascular risk (Framingham risk score above the cohort-specific median). Participants with highest adherence to the MDS had a 13% reduced risk of stroke compared with those in the lowest MDS quartile (quartile 4 versus quartile 1 HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76–0.99; P-trend =0.04). No significant associations were observed in the subgroup with low cardiovascular risk (quartile 4 versus quartile 1 HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58–1.02; P-trend =0.09). After stratification by sex, it was apparent that the associations found in the high-risk group were driven by the findings in women.

11,discussion0,"Our study found that greater adherence to the MD was associated with lower risk of stroke in a UK white population. We found these significant beneficial associations in the whole population with an HR 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74–0.94) between higher and lower adherence to the MD (quartile 4 versus quartile 1). These associations were also significant in women (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.93), and although the HR was lower in men (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.79–1.12), the associations were not significant. We also found that risk of stroke differed by risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), classified by the Framingham risk score, as well as by the MD in the whole population (quartile 4 versus quartile 1 HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76–0.99; P-trend =0.04) and in women (quartile 4 versus quartile 1 HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65–0.97; P-trend =0.02).",74268910-b712-4c0e-a2d8-60ddd4d4431f
12,discussion1," To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate and find differences in risk of stroke, not only according to the MD but also in those with low and high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and in men and women. Although our findings of a protective effect of the MD on risk of stroke were driven by women, they have implications for the general public and clinicians for the prevention of stroke.  We observed few significant associations with individual MD components, indicating that the effects of the MD may be attributable to the synergistic or additive effects of the individual foods or nutrients within the MD12 and that the overall MD pattern was most important in relation to stroke risk.  Although previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs and observational studies have shown significant inverse associations in relation to MD adherence and risk of incident stroke, with studies finding a relative risk of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.48–0.92) and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.59–0.",19212dc2-402b-41c4-95ab-5d9616d386aa
13,discussion2,"91), only 2 observational studies investigated men and women separately in the same cohort.5,6,23,24 It is important to understand sex differences in exposure to the MD because women have unique stroke RFs,11 which include postmenopausal hormone use, hormone status changes, pregnancy, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and oral contraceptive use. The prevalence of other RFs differs between men and women with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and migraine with aura11 being more prevalent in women.  Of the 2 other studies investigating sex differences in associations of stroke with the MD, one observational study in Hong Kong Chinese showed a significant inverse association with higher adherence to MD in men but not in women,23 whereas the other, in Greece, found reductions in incident stroke24 in women, only. It is not clear why we found differences in the associations between the MD and risk of stroke in men and women.",88d639da-2f18-4e48-941c-34b7dc715598
14,discussion3," However, we postulate that the components of the MD may influence the risk of stroke in women more than in men. We are also aware that the different subtypes of stroke may differ in men between sexes and may lead to heterogeneity of response to the MDS.24 We were unable to test this hypothesis in our cohort because of low incidence. However, this deserves further study in the future.  One previous study in the United Kingdom found a nonsignificant inverse association (HR, 0.96; 95% CI = 0.90–1.02) with greater MD adherence and incident stroke.15 However, this study did not stratify by sex, the MD was based on food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s, and average FU was 12.2 years. We build on their analyses by including sex stratified analyses, using 7DDs with a longer FU period.",d5a09336-4c46-4b76-abcb-dac5c56fefc9
15,discussion4,"  Study Strengths The strengths of our study include the prospective design, the use of a comprehensive 7DD, robust outcome assessment method, with few individuals lost to FU, and, besides smoking status, the population is representative of the United Kingdom.19 Another of our study’s advantages include longer FU of 17 years than all except one study in women, only. In addition, using 7DD to measure dietary/nutritional intake is more precise than food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s, which may overestimate the important components of MD.17 We controlled for and measured potential nondietary confounding factors that affect stroke risk, namely, directly measured BP and cholesterol at baseline. Also, we had sufficient power to detect an effect of adherence to the MD on incident stroke in the population and in women when measured separately.",96ad89fb-4a1a-4570-9b17-318d6632c891
16,discussion5,"  Limitations Dietary assessment was based on one assessment at baseline, which does not exclude the possibility that dietary changes or other treatments may occur subsequently, which would alter incident stroke risk. In addition, we did not control for some stroke RFs, for example, atrial fibrillation. Nevertheless, we controlled for major stroke RFs such as previous MI, BP, and vascular diseases. The MDS uses relative rather than absolute values for MD components. This limits comparison with other studies using the same score, as median intakes may be distinct in different populations. Our population was predominantly white, and, therefore, our results may not apply to other ethnic groups.  Summary Greater adherence to the MD was associated with lower risk of stroke in a UK white population, which was attributable to the overall MD pattern, not its individual components.",2816118a-6be5-4d8e-8dd7-02750375c6f9
17,discussion6," For the first time in the literature, we also investigated the potential benefits of the MD in people at low and high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), in men and in women. Although the findings in our study were driven by the associations in women, they have implications for the general public and clinicians for prevention of stroke.
