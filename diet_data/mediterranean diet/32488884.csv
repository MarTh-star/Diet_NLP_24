0,methods0," 2.1. Study Population  We analysed data from the Moli-sani Study, a large population-based cohort study designed to investigate genetic and environmental risk factors in the onset of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and tumor diseases [27]. At the baseline survey performed between 2005 and 2010, 24,325 subjects (aged ≥ 35 y) were recruited from city-hall registries of the Molise region. Exclusion criteria were: pregnancy at the time of recruitment, disturbances in understanding or willingness, current poly-traumas or coma, or refusal to sign the informed consent form. The Moli-sani study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was granted the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Catholic University, Rome, Italy. Details of the study design are available elsewhere [27].  From the initial 24,325 participants, Δage was calculated in a test set of 4772 subjects, as described below and elsewhere [14].",a43557ab-89dc-4a94-be14-e584c1f62736
1,methods1," For the present analysis, we omitted individuals reporting dietary questionnaires judged as unreliable by the interviewers (n = 179), and participants with lack of information on diet (n = 20). The final analysed sample consisted of 4592 subjects.  2.2. Computation of Biological Age  To compute biological age, we used a supervised machine learning algorithm called a deep neural network (deep neural network (DNN)), as described in [14]. Briefly, we deployed a deep neural network (DNN) for the prediction of BA using 36 circulating biomarkers, recruiting centre and sex as input features, and CA of each participant as a label.",a0247b8b-04ba-4733-988f-f2d985e91a31
2,methods2," Biomarkers used included: lipid biomarkers, including triglycerides, high and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, lipoprotein a and apolipoprotein A1 and B; markers of glucose metabolism such as glucose, C-peptide and insulin; liver enzymes, aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase; cardiac and vascular markers such as NT-proB-type Natriuretic Peptide and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I; other hormones such as testosterone and vitamin D; haemostasis markers such as D-Dimer; renal markers (uric acid, albumin, creatinine, cystatin-C); inflammation markers such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein; common haemachrome markers, including red blood cell count and distribution width, haematocrit, haemoglobin levels, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, total white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils; platelet count, mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width.",b55e7741-efbe-4af1-a834-c1c3ec8efa05
3,methods3,"  The deep neural network (DNN) was built in R v3.9 (https://www.r-project.org/) through the Keras package v2.4.0 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/keras/index.html). Briefly, we split the available dataset passing QC (N = 23,858) into a random training and test set (80:20 ratio), then trained the algorithm over 1000 epochs in the training set and evaluated the accuracy in the test set. Finally, BA for each participant and the resulting discrepancy with CA was computed (Δage = BA–CA) within the test set (N = 4772), which was used as the population of study herein. Details on QC, deep neural network (DNN) architecture and performance are reported in [14].  2.3.",2d4b3b02-f0b9-4023-8334-1be892b94228
4,methods4," Dietary Assessment  Food intake during the past 12 months was assessed by the EPIC food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [28] validated and adapted to the Italian population, for a total of 188 food items that were classified into 74 predefined food groups on the basis of similar nutrient characteristics or culinary usage.  Through the use of a specifically designed software [29], frequencies and quantities of each food were linked to Italian food tables [30] to obtain estimates of daily intake of macro- and micro-nutrients and energy, and integrated with the the diet (TAC) values of several foods representative of the average Italian diet, such as fruits, vegetables, oils, beverages, spices, dried fruits, sweets, cereals, pulses and nuts [31].  Polyphenol antioxidant content (polyphenol antioxidant content (PAC)) of the diet was appraised by a polyphenol antioxidant content (PAC)-score as in Pounis et al.",790d2950-e72f-4665-a7e0-ea4adddb75fa
5,methods5," [32], a holistic approach that took into account the potential synergistic effects of polyphenols and likely lowered the possibility for biased regression estimations deriving from multi-correlation of nutritional data For each dietary source of polyphenols (i.e., vegetables, fruits, beverages and alcoholic beverages, for a total of 23 food groups), the mean content in different classes and subclasses of polyphenols was calculated according to the availability of food composition table data. Using this information and the daily consumption of each food source, the total intakes of seven classes and sub-classes of polyphenols were calculated as follows: flavonols (mg/d), flavones (mg/d), flavanones (mg/d), flavanols (mg/d), anthocyanidins (mg/d), isoflavones (mg/d) and lignans (mg/d). The choice of units presented for polyphenols was done according to the units used in the original source [33].",e0918284-21fc-41b6-bc9a-537d1b55e24a
6,methods6,"  Deciles of total intakes of each polyphenol class and sub-class were then generated; for all polyphenol components, higher intakes (that is, >Q6) scored positively, while lower intakes (that is, <Q5) received negative scoring. The polyphenol antioxidant content (PAC)-score ranged between −28 and 28, and resulted from the sum of the seven components. An increase in the score indicated higher total content of polyphenols in the diet.  the diet (TAC) was measured in foods via the use of three different assays: the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), mmol Trolox) assay, measuring the antioxidants’ ability to reduce a radical cation in both lipophilic and hydrophilic conditions; the radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), mmol Trolox) and ferric reducing-antioxidant power (ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), mmol Fe2+) assays,",01e94644-19df-4638-87f7-93e55ad8ced0
7,methods7," evaluating the chain-breaking antioxidant potential and the reducing power of the sample, respectively [31]. The food frequency questionnaire was specifically validated for assessment of dietary the diet (TAC) against trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values estimated by a 3-day weighed food record and plasma trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in a group of healthy Italian adults [34].  2.4. Ascertainment of Risk Factors  Information on sociodemographic variables, lifestyles and clinical variables were obtained by interviewer-administered questionnaires.  Participants were considered to have hypertension, hyperlipidaemia or diabetes if they reported having been treated with disease-specific drugs.  Leisure-time physical activity for sport, walking and gardening was self-reported and dichotomized as <30 or ≥30 min/d.",2ffcff54-dc11-473a-b014-1f666b74d722
8,methods8," Height and weight were measured and body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as kg/m2, and then grouped into three categories as normal (≤25 kg/m2), overweight (>25 and <30 kg/m2) or obese (≥30 kg/m2). Subjects were classified as never-smokers, current smokers or former smokers (reported not having smoked at all over the previous 12 months or more). Education was based on the highest qualification attained and was categorized as (1) up to lower secondary (approximately ≤8 years of study), (2) upper secondary school (8–13 years of study) and (3) postsecondary education (>13 years of study).  2.5. Statistical Analysis  Characteristics of the study population were presented as numbers and percentages, or mean values and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables.",bf40f483-2a25-40bc-bafc-ef9e7fd2c4da
9,methods9,"  Multivariable-adjusted linear regression analysis (PROC REG in SAS) was used to estimate the relationship between dietary factors (independent variable) and Δage (dependent variable) and results were expressed as regression coefficients (β) with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Distribution of missing values was as follows: educational level (n = 1), body mass index (BMI) (n = 4), smoking habit (n = 5), history of cardiovascular disease (n = 69), cancer (n = 19), diabetes (n = 65), hyperlipidaemia (n = 45), hypertension (n = 43) and menopausal status (n = 4). We used a multiple imputation technique (SAS PROC MI, followed by PROC MIANALYZE) to maximize data availability for all variables, avoid bias introduced by not-at-random missing (missing (MNAR)) data patterns and achieve robust results over different simulations (n = 10 imputed datasets).  We first tested association of the polyphenol antioxidant content (PAC)-score with Δage, and then with each polyphenol subgroup intake.",30cb3304-e91a-4fdb-b6ed-894f5d81cd76
10,methods10," Finally, we tested associations with dietary antioxidant capacity measures (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)). Statistical tests were two-sided, and p values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance for the analysis of the polyphenol antioxidant content (PAC)-score; for the test of different polyphenol categories and antioxidant capacities, the α threshold underwent Bonferroni correction according to the number of markers tested (α = 0.007 and 0.017, respectively).  Each dietary indicator was scaled by its standard deviation so that regression coefficients indicated the variation in Δage for 1 standard deviation change for each dietary indicator.",bd0ad023-d822-4f51-9815-db0af5ef2403
11,methods11,"  Based on previous literature and biological plausibility, two models were fitted: model 1 was adjusted for age, sex and energy intake (Kcal/d); model 2 was further controlled for education, leisure-time physical activity, smoking habit, body mass index (BMI), CVD, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy and dietary fibre (g/d).  Analyses were performed separately by sex. Appropriate multiplicative terms for testing interaction were included in the multivariable models to test for a difference of effect of dietary polyphenols/the diet (TAC) by gender.  Data analyses were generated using SAS/STAT software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).  3. Results  The analysed population consisted of 2381 women (51.8%) and 2211 men (48.2%) with a mean CA of 55.6 y (±11.7), BA of 54.8 y (±8.6) and Δage of −0.75 (±7.72). The majority of participants were low-educated (53.1%), prevalently never-smokers (50.0%) and overweight (42.",2c9a3574-0dca-4d70-a0e3-5f0144205c3d
12,methods12,"1%) (Table 1).  As compared to subjects with lower polyphenol antioxidant content (PAC)-score (Q1), those participants reporting higher polyphenol antioxidant content (PAC)-score (Q4) had lower Δage, were prevalently men, tended to be well-educated and former smokers and practiced more physical exercise, and the women in Q4 were prevalently under replacement hormonal therapy (6.2%) (Table 1).  Greater intake of polyphenols was also associated with higher antioxidant capacity of the diet and increased fibre and energy intake (Table 1).  In multivariable-adjusted analysis, increased polyphenol antioxidant content (PAC)-score was inversely associated with the Δage (β = −0.27; 95%CI −0.52, −0.02). None of the polyphenol classes and sub-classes was associated with Δage at the statistical significance thresholds set (α = 0.007). Similarly, no association of Δage with indices of the diet (TAC) was observed (Table 2).",d02e8a4c-ee19-4752-9503-c7890ebfca6f
13,methods13,"  Sub-group analyses revealed that the associations of Δage with certain polyphenol sub-classes differed by sex; in particular, isoflavones and flavones were inversely associated with Δage in women but not in men (p values for interaction = 0.02 and 0.0002, respectively), whereas lignans showed a greater inverse association with Δage in women as compared to men (p value for interaction = 0.02); finally, flavanols were inversely correlated with Δage in men (β = −0.09; 95%CI −0.32, 0.14) while being directly associated among women (β = 0.17; 95%CI −0.06, 0.41; p for interaction < 0.0001) (Figure 1).  4. Discussion  In a large cohort of Italian adults, a diet rich in polyphenols was associated with decelerated biological aging, an emerging predictor of cardiovascular disease risk. Total antioxidant capacity of the diet was not associated with biological age acceleration.",37ba2b42-3368-4139-9d37-3041798a9c6d
14,methods14,"  Our results were in line with and extended prior observations from the same cohort, highlighting an inverse association between biological aging and a high adherence to Mediterranean diet which is abundant in polyphenol-rich foods [14].  Consistently, data from other population-based cohorts previously showed a favourable association between polyphenol-rich diets with various markers of aging, including telomere length [25], cognitive decline [35] and DNA methylation [36], that are susceptible to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of plant-based diets.  Polyphenols are naturally occurring antioxidants mainly present in a large variety of edible plants (i.e., vegetables, cereals, legumes, fruits, nuts, etc.) and plant-derived beverages such as coffee, tea, beer and red wine [19].  Several epidemiological studies have examined the association between intake of certain polyphenol subgroups and their sources, and the incidence of cardiovascular disease [37] and mortality [38].",4e19d0a4-2e2f-4daa-bad2-1d44c3cd373b
15,methods15," Moreover, they reported improvements in inflammatory markers [39] and lipid profile associated with increasing polyphenol intake [40].  The health advantages of fruits and vegetables, rich in polyphenols and antioxidants, have been extensively described also in the regulation of inflammation, a major factor contributing to the senescence—and the reduction of—oxidative stress, which plays a key role in the aging process [41,42,43], and possibly in the etiopathogenesis of osteoporosis [44].  Other studies have also emphasized the impact of diets rich in fruits and vegetables on mitochondrial DNA alterations, implicated in premature aging [23]. Additionally, the benefits of plant-based diets have been studied also with reference to telomere attrition, which is possibly accelerated by oxidative stress and inflammation [25].",4ae9b23f-758a-43e7-bece-396b21046a44
16,methods16,"  Dietary polyphenols likely act on human health through several mechanisms; it has been demonstrated that some polyphenols and their metabolites exert anti-atherosclerotic effects, improve endothelial function and antioxidant status, increase nitric oxide release, and modulate inflammation and lipid metabolism [5,26,31,45,46,47].  The anti-aging properties of dietary polyphenols have been ascribed at least in part to their antioxidant properties that, through several mechanisms including ROS-scavenging actions, contribute to reduce oxidative stress. These mechanisms play an important role in the aging process and various aging-associated chronic diseases [48], including bone mineral density, by preventing oxidation-induced damage to bone cells [49].",15ac3257-11c3-49a5-b8d3-7bd0d649b27f
17,methods17,"  Aging is also the result of an imbalance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory networks [50], a condition often named inflammaging, characterized by elevated levels of blood inflammatory markers that lead to high susceptibility to chronic morbidity, disability, frailty, and premature death [51].  Previous data from the Moli-sani cohort showed an inverse association between dietary polyphenols and a score of low-grade inflammation, which supports the anti-inflammatory action of these bioactive compounds [38].  A consistent body of evidence shows a link between dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins and antioxidant-rich foods and lower risk of mortality [52] and cardiovascular disease [53].  As people eat foods in combination, the evaluation of the total antioxidant capacity of the diet is a more valuable approach to measure their joint antioxidant effects [54]. Also, levels of single antioxidants in food do not necessarily reflect their total antioxidant capacity.",a070f0d6-d362-4b30-b0e0-0cebcb71faaf
18,methods18," Rather, this depends on the synergic and redox interactions among the different molecules present in the food [54].  Diets with high antioxidant potential are inversely associated with frailty [55] and with longer telomeres [56], although they were found to be unrelated to risk of major neurological diseases [57].  Of interest, in our study, the absence of an association between total antioxidant capacity of the diet with decelerated biological aging suggests that the observed inverse association of dietary polyphenols with biological aging may not be exclusively due to their antioxidant potential.  Also, because of the relatively poor bioavailability of many of these compounds, their health promoting effects could not be easily explained by the antioxidant action, which may occur only at high circulating and tissue concentrations [58].",57b78c15-9e89-4663-b059-5eaafda1a348
19,methods19,"  Consistently, analyses in the PREDIMED cohort found no association between the antioxidant capacity of the diet and mortality [59], while observing a reduced risk of CVD associated with dietary polyphenols [37]. Similarly, in a cohort of postmenopausal women, dietary polyphenol intake—but not the dietary total antioxidant capacity—was inversely related to cardiovascular disease risk [60], suggesting that mechanisms other than antioxidant activity may be responsible for the health benefits of polyphenols, including positive modulation of gut microbiota [61] and reduction of inflammation [62].  Despite highlighting a relationship between the total content of polyphenols in the diet with decelerated biological aging, we failed to observe an association with the intake of specific polyphenol classes and sub-classes. This could possibly reinforce the actual usefulness of a holistic approach as implemented through the polyphenol antioxidant content (PAC)-score.",6be940b0-333a-4bfa-8afb-1aa656938a34
20,methods20,"  Some sex-related differences were observed in our study. In particular, we found that dietary polyphenols and some polyphenol sub-classes were more strongly associated with decelerated biological aging among women than in men.  Such sex-based differences in the relation between polyphenols in the diet and health have not been extensively documented [63]. However, a few epidemiological studies revealed that polyphenol intake is more likely to be associated with health advantages among women than in men, as in a recent study showing that polyphenol consumption was significantly associated with individual components of the metabolic syndrome only in women [64]. Similarly, a positive association of total antioxidant capacity of the diet with pulmonary function was observed among women only, being stronger in premenopausal/never smoker women [31]. These sex-related differences may be attributed to physiological differences between men and women, e.g.",f511ea25-20e4-4138-833e-5aec5c7aaf2d
21,methods21,", body composition, gastrointestinal characteristics, renal function and metabolism, that impact on pharmacokinetic parameters [65]. Additionally, a role for sex hormones might explain the differences between men and women [66] in the association of polyphenols and biological aging. Further studies—possibly analysing interactions with sex hormone titers—are warranted to investigate this hypothesis.  Strengths and Limitations  This study has several strengths, including a large sample size with thorough measurement of diet and risk factors to minimize confounding. We used an innovative, machine-learning-based measure of biological aging; a deep neural network was applied to a large number of circulating biomarkers, an approach which has, to date, been developed in just a few cohorts worldwide [8,67].  However, there are some limitations that need to be carefully considered. First, the observational nature of the study could not fully rule out residual or unmeasured confounding.",ba1a8d53-e820-4aab-b59a-f308694c6ae3
22,methods22," In addition, the present findings were derived from a cross-sectional analysis, with consequent difficulty to define directionality of effect. Second, dietary data were based on self-reported information collected through the use of an food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and therefore may be susceptible to misreporting that could have led to measurement error and bias or to difficulties in assessing portion sizes and subsequent inadequacies in food composition tables. However, such potential limitations were mitigated by energy adjustment. Also, the validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used in this study has been previously largely employed and has been reported to have predictive validity for a number of health outcomes [61,62].",11c6b2ad-475f-4d96-9e24-7432281fac2f
23,methods23," Third, our data were obtained from a cohort of adults residing in a small Southern Italian region, and this might limit the generalizability of our findings, although the main characteristics of our population are comparable to those of the Italian Cardiovascular Epidemiological Observatory and are therefore representative of at least the Italian population [68]. Finally, other assessments of biological aging might show a higher accuracy than blood age, e.g., brain age [10], but these are based on expensive instrumental assessments (i.e., Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and not easily applicable to large population-based cohorts.  5. Conclusions  Results from this Mediterranean cohort indicate that a diet rich in polyphenols is associated with decelerated biological aging, a novel predictor of cardiovascular disease risk, possibly through mechanisms that go beyond their antioxidant activity.",f9d1eaa4-4b8f-4999-94a8-4728f0335d0a
24,methods24,"  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-based study addressing the association between polyphenol-rich diets and biological aging as reflected by a machine-learning-based measure of blood-based biological age.  Our results have added to the existing literature by expanding knowledge on the anti-aging properties of dietary polyphenols. Future longitudinal analyses are warranted to confirm our results and to test whether a favourable modulation of biological aging is likely to mediate the well-established relationship between polyphenol-rich diets and risk of cardiovascular disease—and possibly of bone health.
