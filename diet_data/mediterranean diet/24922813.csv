0,methods0,"Participants The present study was conducted among a sample of sixty-four men and fifty-nine premenopausal women aged between 25 and 50 years, and were recruited through different media advertisements in the Québec City Metropolitan area (Canada). In women, a follicle-stimulating hormone (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)) measurement was performed if needed (for example, when women presented menstrual irregularities) to confirm premenopausal status (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) < 20 IU/l)( 17 ). Men and women had to present slightly elevated LDL-C concentrations (between 3·0 and 4·9 mmol/l)( 18 ) or a total-C:HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio ≥ 5·0, and at least one of the four following criteria of the metabolic syndrome( 19 ): (1) TAG concentrations ≥ 1.7 mmol/l; (2) fasting glycaemia between 6·1 and 6·9 mmol/l; (3) blood pressure measurements ≥ 130/85 mmHg; and (4) waist circumference ≥ 80 cm in women and ≥ 94 cm in men( 20 ).",d5eaac35-2005-4feb-bbcc-5b95b66cccdc

We excluded men and women who had cardiovascular events and who used medication that could affect dependent variables under study, i.e. medication for hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes (type 1 and type 2). Pregnant women, smokers, participants with an alcoholism history or with a high Mediterranean score (Medscore > 29; i.e. food pattern already highly concordant with the Mediterranean diet)( 21 ) were also excluded. The present study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Laval University Research Ethics Committee on human experimentation.",fd378da0-e109-4b4c-a810-063d0ac0cdd2
2,methods2," All subjects voluntarily agreed to participate in the research project and written informed consent was obtained from all men and women before their participation in the study. This clinical trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01852721.  Study design The 12-week nutritional programme was based on the self determination theory (SDT) and used a motivational interviewing approach. The self determination theory (SDT) relies on the quality of the motivation that regulates behaviours, which lies on a continuum from lower to higher self-determined motivation forms (extending from amotivation to intrinsic motivation)( 22 ). The self determination theory (SDT) also postulates that the key component for the development of intrinsic motivation is the satisfaction of basic psychological needs which are autonomy, competence and relatedness( 22 ).",2b19aa7e-9765-4a75-ba58-74705188cd98
3,methods3," The study was conducted in five phases (spanning from January 2010 to November 2012) and the nutritional intervention included three group sessions (with ten to fifteen individuals each), three individual sessions and four follow-up telephone calls with a registered dietitian (Fig. 1). Three registered dietitians were trained to provide a standardised intervention and participants always met with the same dietitian during individual sessions. The first group session was a lecture, always provided by the same dietitian and aiming at explaining principles of the traditional Mediterranean diet (length: 2·5 h; thirteen to twenty-five participants per group). At week four, men and women actively participated to a 3 h Mediterranean cooking lesson during which they had to cook a Mediterranean meal (eight to fourteen participants per group).",b1934d4e-89f9-4dd2-9848-1618a93c9ac5
4,methods4," At week eight, they shared a 3 h Mediterranean potluck dinner aimed at discussing barriers met in adopting dietary recommendations since the beginning of the intervention (five to twelve participants per group). Individual counselling took place at weeks 1, 5 and 10 and lasted between 45 min and 1 h for each appointment. Individual follow-up telephone calls took place at weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12, and lasted about 20–30 min for each telephone call. The main objective of individual counselling and follow-up telephone calls was to assess dietary changes and to determine progressive personal goals aimed at improving the adherence to Mediterranean diet principles. Different tools such as the decisional balance and the action plan, congruent with the motivational interviewing approach, were used during the individual sessions to formulate dietary objectives while increasing self-determined motivation. In accordance with the self determination theory (SDT)( 22 ), basic psychological needs (i.e.",c1f59312-4442-4f59-8635-c83f13f4c503
5,methods5," autonomy, competence and relatedness) were promoted during the nutritional intervention via the motivational interviewing approach in order to increase self-determined motivation. More specifically, autonomy and competence of men and women were promoted by the dietitian during individual sessions, i.e. in supporting them into their decision-making process about dietary changes and potential strategies to achieve and maintain these changes, but also during the group sessions by improving their cooking skills and knowledge related to food and nutrition. Therefore, the dietitian had a client-centred approach and put no pressure on participants about the type of dietary objectives to be chosen. In addition, no emphasis was put on body-weight control. Men and women were encouraged to maintain dietary changes in an autonomous way at the end of the nutritional programme and there was no additional contact with the dietitian after the end of the 12-week intervention.

Measurements of dependent variables All measurements were performed before (time = 0) and after the 12-week nutritional intervention programme (time = 12 weeks), except for the perceived adherence to the Mediterranean diet which was assessed only at the end of the intervention (time = 12 weeks).  Dietary variables A validated FFQ( 23 ) was administered by a registered dietitian. The FFQ is based on typical foods available in Québec. It contains ninety-one items and thirty-three subquestions. Participants were questioned about the frequency of intake of different foods and drinks during the last month and could report the frequency of these intakes in terms of day, week or month.",5336c190-937b-4ecd-af43-607511ad7025
7,methods7," A Medscore( 21 ) was calculated based on the FFQ and allowed to assess the level of adherence to the Mediterranean food pattern. A partial score varying from 0 to 4 is attributed to each of the eleven components of the Mediterranean pyramid. The Medscore could therefore vary between 0 and 44 points. Components of the Medscore are: grains (whole and refined); vegetables (whole and juices); fruits (whole and juices); legumes, nuts and seeds; olive oil (including olives and rapeseed oil); dairy products; fish (including seafoods); poultry; eggs; sweets and red meat/processed meat. As previously described( 21 ), a high consumption of food groups promoted by the Mediterranean diet (grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and seeds, olive oil and fish) contributed to increase the Medscore, whereas a high consumption of food groups less concordant with the Mediterranean diet (sweets and red meat/processed meat) contributed to decrease the Medscore.",02d7abd8-5220-4af6-9880-cdeed6e06026
8,methods8," Moreover, a moderate consumption of dairy products, poultry and eggs obtained the maximum possible score for the respective component. A maximum of one point was respectively attributed to refined grains, vegetables juice, fruit juice consumption and intake of rapeseed oil or margarine made from olive or rapeseed oil. Macronutrient and micronutrient intakes obtained from the FFQ were evaluated using the Nutrition Data System for Research software (NDS-R, version 4.03_31; Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota).  Anthropometric and metabolic profile According to standardised procedures( 24 ) height was measured to the nearest millimetre with a stadiometer (Seca 222 Mechanical Telescopic Stadiometer), body weight was measured to the nearest 0·1 kg on a calibrated balance (BWB-800S Digital scale; Tanita), and BMI was then calculated. Waist circumference measure was also taken to the nearest millimetre according to standardised procedures( 24 ).",a3e8fdd3-8f66-4b23-93c4-5dfaffa10908

Blood samples were collected after a 12 h overnight fast. Total-C, HDL-C and TAG concentrations in serum were measured using commercial reagents on a Modular P chemistry analyser (with 0·8 and 1·7 % of within- and between-assay precision, respectively) (Roche Diagnostics). Serum LDL-C concentrations were obtained by calculation using the Friedewald equation( 25 ) and apoB concentrations by immunoturbidimetry (with < 1·5 and < 2·5 % of within- and between-assay precision, respectively) (Roche Diagnostics).",e8764f90-69ca-4a18-9bb7-4540c7660593

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured on the right arm and using an automated blood pressure monitor (BPM 300-BpTRU: Vital Signs Monitor) after a 10 min rest in the sitting position. Measurement of blood pressure was computed as a mean of three readings.  Perceived adherence to the Mediterranean diet At the end of the nutritional intervention (time = 12 weeks), men and women were invited to rate their perception of adherence to the Mediterranean diet principles according to a visual analogue scale (range 0–150 mm).",2dce3fb6-92ba-45d3-898a-82f2eaba26f4
11,methods11," Accordingly, the following question was asked: ‘In your opinion, to what extent do your current dietary intakes meet the Mediterranean diet principles?’ (not at all to perfectly). The distance between 0 mm and the vertical mark drawn on the 150 mm horizontal line was then measured with a ruler and corresponded to the perceived level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (adapted from Dansinger et al.( 26 )).  Statistical analyses Results are first presented in descriptive tables with pre-intervention (time = 0) and post-intervention (time = 12 weeks) mean values (95 % CI) according to men and women (Tables 2 and 4).",33066c6a-5634-46d2-913c-9928d9e87f1d

Differences between men and women in dietary intakes, anthropometric and metabolic variables were assessed using an ANCOVA (general linear model; GLM procedure) on Δ values.

The interaction was removed from the model when it did not reach statistical significance. Student's t test was used to compare macronutrient intakes as well as anthropometric and metabolic variables of men and women before the beginning of the nutritional intervention programme and allowed comparisons of the perceived adherence to the Mediterranean diet between men and women. The χ2 test was performed to compare the frequencies of categorical data, i.e. attrition rate and attendance rate to intervention sessions, between men and women. Since three different dietitians were in charge of providing the intervention, the intervener effect was tested using an ANOVA with the GLM procedure.",75273646-ec78-4edb-b7aa-0659a96c76fe

In order to determine sample size, we considered a difference of 35 % in the change in Medscore as being clinically significant, based on results of a previous study from our group( 21 ). Therefore a final sample size of forty-five men and forty-five women was needed to detect a difference of 35 % in the change in Medscore between men and women with a power of 0·80 and α of 0·05, considering that the standard deviation corresponds to 55 % of the mean of the change in Medscore.

Results showed that our nutritional intervention led to improvements in dietary, anthropometric and metabolic profile, that were generally more pronounced in men than in women.  The present results indicate that both men and women increased their level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Medscore) in response to the 12-week nutritional intervention and therefore both men and women improved the general quality of their diet. This improvement in the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet also indicates that our nutritional intervention programme based on the self determination theory (SDT) appears to be appropriate for both men and women.",869e2d92-5c80-4163-a194-26b7e7702553
25,discussion1," Moreover, the significant association found in both men and women between perceived level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the actual Medscore calculated suggests that men and women had a similar understanding of the intervention and also the capability to assess the quality of their diet accurately after the end of the 12-week nutritional intervention, which represents relevant information in a context of nutritional education.  Although men and women improved their dietary intakes as shown by the increase in the Medscore, differences were observed between men and women when examining individual components of the Medscore, which were concordant with changes observed in nutritional intakes in response to the intervention.",2d48160f-a842-44c2-a6b9-a07b9c1233e9
26,discussion2," Indeed, the more pronounced changes observed in men in some food groups, for example, by greater decrease in red and processed meat and greater increase in fruit consumption, were consistent with some differences observed between men and women in nutrient intakes such as the greater decreases in energy density, percentage of energy provided by lipids, SFA and trans-fatty acids, and the greater increase in fibre intake in men than in women. Moreover, the significant decrease in energy density in men was concordant with the decrease in daily energy intake, as previous studies have reported that decreasing energy density of the diet leads to a spontaneous decrease in energy intake( 27 ). Similarly to our findings, results from a nutritional intervention, which promoted the traditional Mediterranean diet over a period of 12 months among a Spanish population, reported a greater success in men than in women when considering the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet( 12 ).",5d630ad2-31c2-4c52-a5b0-7d6f464fb6a8
27,discussion3," On the other hand, the present results are different from other studies( 13 , 28 ) reporting greater dietary changes in women than in men. Several differences in the intervention design can explain that differences observed between men and women regarding changes in dietary intakes in response to our nutritional intervention programme differ, for example, from the study of Bemelmans et al.( 13 ). First, our intervention included group but also individual counselling sessions to individualise dietary objectives and strategies adopted and to support men and women to overcome barriers in the adoption of the Mediterranean diet, whereas only group sessions were provided to men and women in the study of Bemelmans et al.( 13 ). Second, our nutritional intervention aimed at promoting autonomy and competence in men and women towards the adoption of the Mediterranean diet.",ee7d9624-efe1-48fb-847f-00325832d1dd
28,discussion4," Indeed, we did so by supporting them in their dietary changes and strategies to achieve these changes and by promoting the development of their skills and knowledge related to nutrition, which contrasts with specific nutritional guidelines and daily intake explained at the beginning of the intervention in the study of Bemelmans et al.( 13 ). It can be argued that providing more details about dietary guidelines may reduce the possibility for autonomy and that a more passive role of subjects in a nutritional intervention could explain divergence in results obtained among studies. Globally, direct comparison of the present results with those from the literature remains difficult because of major differences in the intervention design and statistical analyses among studies.  Some baseline characteristics in men and women may have influenced the magnitude of dietary changes observed in response to our nutritional intervention.",53ea9eba-25ff-4835-87b9-501fa449ea35
29,discussion5," Accordingly, healthier diet at baseline of a dietary intervention has been previously reported to decrease the likelihood of observing significant dietary changes( 12 ). The fact that women in the present study had globally dietary intakes of higher quality at baseline and which tended to be closer to the traditional Mediterranean diet pattern than those of men could thus possibly explain, at least partially, differences observed between men and women in dietary changes. In the context of our nutritional intervention, it can be hypothesised that because men's dietary intakes at baseline were generally further away from Mediterranean diet principles, they could possibly identify more easily changes that could be made and modify their eating habits, especially in the context of individual counselling sessions where specific dietary objectives were settled.",f8b8719b-3fa7-49c2-a6ee-8d8de646b831
30,discussion6," Accordingly, the fact that many differences observed between men and women were no longer significant once dietary changes were adjusted for the baseline value of the response variable brings support to this hypothesis. The present results underline the importance of considering the dietary profile of men and women before the beginning of a nutritional intervention to properly respond to the clients' needs and maximise potential improvements in dietary intakes during the intervention. However, because some differences between men and women in dietary changes were significant once adjusted for the baseline value of the response variable, it is suggested that differences between men and women regarding other factors than baseline dietary intakes, such as attitudes and beliefs towards health and nutrition, might have influenced their response to the nutritional intervention.",8c81553b-f622-480b-8e05-593cae4cefe0
31,discussion7," Our hypothesis is in agreement with a previous study( 29 ) reporting that health attitudes and beliefs are relevant predictors of adherence to health recommendations. The use of mixed methods in which qualitative and quantitative data are combined would therefore warrant to be considered in the future to obtain more specific information about such factors in men and women.  Although our nutritional intervention promoted healthy dietary changes with no focus on body weight, both men and women showed improvements in their anthropometric profile with significant decreases in BMI and waist circumference, in response to the 12-week nutritional intervention. The present results are concordant with previous studies, which found that a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower prevalence of overweight or obesity( 30 , 31 ).",1dd789f8-7393-4048-bc27-66cb182d49db
32,discussion8," The Mediterranean diet is recognised to be highly satiating( 31 , 32 ) and the present results suggest that dietary changes led to increased satiety. More specifically, increases in intakes of legumes, nuts and seeds and whole-grain products reported in both men and women possibly contributed to a decrease in energy density through increased water content and fibre intake( 33 ). Moreover, the decrease in red and processed meat intake may have led to replacement of animal proteins by vegetable proteins sources such as legumes, nuts and seeds, which contain satiating components such as proteins and fibres( 34 , 35 ).  As for metabolic profile, the present results showed more pronounced changes in metabolic variables in men than in women and these can possibly be explained by greater dietary changes observed in men, in response to the nutritional intervention. As suggested by Estruch et al.",85041887-0734-4883-a5ce-93d0471b38c7
33,discussion9,"( 1 ), potential synergy among nutrient-rich foods included in the Mediterranean diet might foster favourable changes in some pathways of cardiovascular risks. It is also possible that some sex-related characteristics such as the level of sex hormones may interact with the complex synergistic effect between food components, resulting in a smaller beneficial impact of the Mediterranean diet in women than in men. In support of this, we recently reported significant improvements in insulin homeostasis in men only, in response to an isoenergetic controlled experimental diet based on the traditional Mediterranean diet where all foods and drinks were provided to the participants( 7 ). However, the absence of differences between men and women in metabolic changes once statistical adjustment was performed for the baseline value of the response variable underlines the importance of the metabolic status at the beginning of a nutritional intervention programme.",35e74032-76f9-4f54-b105-9187890b3e20
34,discussion10," Indeed, results related to metabolic changes suggest that an individual with more deteriorated metabolic variables before the beginning of a nutritional intervention could show greater health improvements in response to the intervention, which is concordant with the fact than men in the present study had a more deteriorated metabolic profile at baseline and improved more in response to the intervention than women.  We acknowledge that the present results cannot be extrapolated to the whole population because we recruited men and women presenting risk factors for CVD and who had dietary intakes closer to recommendations of the Canada's Food Guide recommendations than the general adult population in Canada( 36 ). Moreover, although anthropometric and metabolic variables were measured, dietary intakes were self-reported. Therefore, the risk of misreporting dietary intakes cannot be excluded.",f417f903-23a9-4fb8-9970-c1de6bcd8886
35,discussion11," The present study has also important strengths such as the fact that analyses were conducted distinctively in men and women according to dietary intakes, anthropometric variables and metabolic profile in the context of a nutritional intervention programme. Also, our nutritional intervention based on the self determination theory (SDT) appears to be acceptable for both men and women as similar attrition and attendance rate to the intervention as well as to its specific components (i.e. group meetings, individual sessions, follow-up telephone calls) was observed among them. Although attrition rate found in the present study was similar to those reported in the literature among nutritional interventions based on a motivational interviewing approach( 37 ), reasons for not attending some sessions remain difficult to identify and might differ between men and women. It remains essential to consider the clinical implication related to attendance rate when developing a nutritional intervention.",25e39714-cb44-49c1-9ea5-ef5bbd5a3c95
36,discussion12," Indeed, the lack of flexibility in the schedule related to group meeting attendance must be considered in the development of interventions as it may require efforts for some individuals to attend pre-scheduled meetings and this might progressively generate fatigue with time. It is also possible that active participation in practical activities, for example the cooking lesson, may be perceived as requiring too much effort for some individuals. Nevertheless, the present study underlines the potential of improvement in adherence to the Mediterranean diet among a non-Mediterranean population, more specifically in the context of an intervention during which men and women chose their own dietary objectives (i.e. based on their personal interest and motivations).",c888ddf3-f9ca-4d0b-a0f5-aefd82ce95c8
37,discussion13," In addition, the present results bring information about differences between men and women in potential health benefits obtained following a 12-week nutritional intervention programme promoting the Mediterranean diet, and thus support the relevance to consider gender in the development of nutritional intervention programmes aimed at preventing chronic diseases.  Conclusions In conclusion, the present results suggest that the nutritional intervention programme promoting the adoption of the Mediterranean diet and based on the self determination theory (SDT) led to greater improvements in dietary intakes in men than in women, which appear to have contributed to beneficial anthropometric and metabolic changes, more particularly in men.",ebd0b84b-15e4-4c36-93bc-2b99e501dde2
38,discussion14," However, the present results also suggest that the more deteriorated metabolic profile found in men at baseline appears to explain to a large extent the fact that the improvements in CVD risk factors were more pronounced in men than in women in response to the intervention.
