0,introduction0,"Overall dietary intake modification, compared with individual dietary attributes, is proposed as a more effective approach for cardiometabolic disease prevention and intervention.1 The Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean (MED)) uses olive oil as the predominant oil; is rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds; includes moderate amounts of fish and dairy products; and is limited in red and processed meats and sweets. Results from observational studies2,3,4 and a randomized clinical trial5 have provided evidence of a beneficial association of Mediterranean (MED) intake with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. The Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMediterranean (MED))) randomized trial conducted in Spain reported that the Mediterranean (MED) intake (pooled supplementation of olive oil and nuts groups) compared with the control group led to 53% reduced risk of incident diabetes during a 4-year period.",c3ac5362-8a62-42a1-bfed-639390697e0b

No randomized trials of Mediterranean (MED) intervention have been conducted in the United States for clinical endpoints such as type 2 diabetes. Observational studies in US populations with a follow-up of 20 years or less and approximately 6 years have reported that adherence to healthy lifestyles, including Mediterranean (MED) intake, was associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes13 and improved glycemic biomarkers,14 respectively.",c2648dea-edba-439f-89db-e5559d502f2c

This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)) reporting guideline.  Mediterranean (MED) Intake Assessment We previously described in detail the method for assessment of the Mediterranean (MED) score.18 Briefly, the Mediterranean (MED) score (range, 0 to 9) is based on adherence to 9 dietary components; 1 point is given if the intake of that particular dietary component was greater than the study median for intake of fruits, vegetables (excluding potatoes), whole grains, legumes, nuts, fish, and the ratio of mono-unsaturated to saturated fatty acids.",cfcec329-ae6e-47b4-abeb-0d424a8f9965

For the current analysis, Mediterranean (MED) score was categorized into 3 levels (0-3, 4-5, and 6-9) to allow for comparison with prior studies.18,19 Furthermore, the top category (ie, score 6-9) also represents the top quartile of the study population.  Incident Type 2 Diabetes Ascertainment All participants were continuously followed up for the occurrence of incident diabetes via annual questionnaires asking whether and when they had been diagnosed with diabetes since baseline. Reported cases of diabetes were confirmed by either telephone interview or supplemental questionnaire.

At baseline, blood was collected using EDTA tubes, which were stored at −170 °C until analyses were performed. HbA1c was measured with an immunoturbidometric assay (Roche Diagnostics).21 Lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured with immunoturbidometric assays using Hitachi-911 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics).21 Traditional lipids including total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG) were enzymatically assessed (Roche Diagnostics), and TG was corrected for endogenous glycerol.",46499ab2-a2f5-4a6e-86ca-89f45a91bd91

Biomarkers of insulin resistance made the largest contribution, followed by BMI, high density lipoprotein (HDL) measures, and inflammation, with lesser contributions from BCAA, Vlow density lipoprotein (LDL) measures, low density lipoprotein (LDL) measures (but not low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol), blood pressure, and apolipoproteins.",ebfacf72-ba90-43ab-a71d-4c731e059135
31,discussion1," Of note, measures of glycaemia, specifically HbA1c, did not contribute to the lower risk of Mediterranean (MED) with type 2 diabetes.  Our results are consistent with the prior evidence, which suggests that higher consumption of Mediterranean (MED) intake was associated with 30% lower risk of diabetes,6,34,35 while in another US population higher Mediterranean (MED) intake was associated with 25% reduction in diabetes.13 Previous studies have demonstrated a favorable effect of Mediterranean (MED) intake on metabolic biomarkers.3,4,36,37 The effect of Mediterranean (MED) intake on insulin resistance–related biomarkers, including fasting insulin and fasting glucose, have been reported.3 We have previously reported that Mediterranean (MED) intake is associated with improved metabolic, inflammatory, insulin resistance, and adiposity biomarkers18 and lower cardiovascular disease risk, by up to 28%.",74dcd68a-7685-4cef-9aa1-3b04ffef7f50
32,discussion2," Our current findings support that insulin resistance, adiposity, lipoprotein metabolism, and inflammation are the most relevant contributors to the inverse Mediterranean (MED)–diabetes risk association. Mediterranean (MED) is traditionally a plant-based diet with relatively high consumption of extra virgin olive oil and less consumption of red meat and sweets. Hence, this complex nutrient density with low glycemic index may explain the lower risk of type 2 diabetes.  Strengths and Limitations Strengths of the study include the prospective epidemiological design with detailed dietary intake measures, a large number of incident diabetes cases during 25 years of follow-up, and comprehensive traditional and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based novel biomarkers assessments.

33,discussion3," Study participants were well-educated female health professionals across the United States who were predominantly White individuals and might have different behaviors than men, individuals from other racial/ethnic backgrounds, or the general public. Studies that stratified by ethnicity have reported that Mediterranean (MED) diet is associated with improved glycemic control and reduced cardiovascular disease risk, blood pressure, and obesity among Black individuals.38 The possibility of residual confounding regarding unmeasured factors cannot be ruled out. In the present study, dietary information was assessed through self-reported FFQs, which might lead to the possibility of exposure misclassification, underreporting and overreporting that might attenuate the Mediterranean (MED)-diabetes association toward null.",aba90959-9c2c-47d4-b76d-dd2b3c6b30dd
34,discussion4," Other key limitations include the fact that BMI was self-reported, participants were not uniformly screened for diabetes and surveillance bias might be possible, and the current study was not a randomized clinical trial. Inherent to observational epidemiological study design is the possibility of residual confounding of unmeasured factors. However, the models included detailed adjustment with potential confounders, and additional adjustment for other factors made only negligible changes in the estimates, which suggests that residual confounding is unlikely. Furthermore, the results from the counterfactual framework approach were similar to the standard approach, and the Mediterranean (MED) diet score has the potential to minimize confounding by including nutritional confounders in the score and capturing effect modification among the nutritional variables.39 Diet intake was only examined at study entry to be consistent with the time of biomarker measurements.",a55b9f0a-6fd6-4e39-b744-1284c9e3ea29
35,discussion5," Diet was self-reported and was assessed through a validated FFQ, which reduces the possibility of measurement error. As single measurements were performed for both dietary intake and biomarkers, it is possible that some of the covariates examined (ie, hypertension or BMI) may have influenced subsequent consumption of Mediterranean (MED) intake, suggesting that they could be both intermediate factors and/or confounders. Finally, multiple comparisons were performed, increasing the chance of a type I error.  Conclusions The findings of this cohort suggest that a proportion of the lower risk of diabetes associated with a Mediterranean-type dietary pattern may be mediated through insulin resistance, BMI, lipoprotein metabolism, and inflammation. In exploratory analyses, the inverse association between Mediterranean (MED) intake and type 2 diabetes risk was only observed among women with BMI of at least 25.",3017b557-23f4-4678-bfb9-f7dc695c6125
