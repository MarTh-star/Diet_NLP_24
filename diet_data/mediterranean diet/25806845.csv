2,results1,"  nutritionosteoporosisageingMediterranean diet ==== Body I. INTRODUCTION Demographic ageing is a global trend. In the European Union, the number of people aged 65+ will almost double over the next 50 years, from 85 million in 2008 to 151 million in 2060. Among older adults, frailty is highly prevalent and constitutes a major health problem. Santos and Eggiman estimated the prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty in 10 European countries and showed that for those aged > 65 years frailty ranges between 5–27.3% and pre frailty between 35–51% of the population [1]. Frailty syndrome is a complex interaction between several factors, including but not limited to natural physiological alterations seen in aging, co- morbid diseases, nutritive and nutritional insufficiencies, cumulative negative environmental impact, genetics, and lifestyle choices. Frail individuals are vulnerable and at high risk of adverse health outcomes.",6a295261-3774-4efc-9038-91a3e58018bc
3,results2," They have functional impairments which often result in falls, immobility and confusion. Frailty limits regular physical activity and its many health benefits, including the prevention of cognitive decline. People affected by frailty make the most use of community resources, hospitals and long-term care institutions. Early screening for risk of frailty and functional decline in older adults and training of those who start to deploy frail conditions is key to successful prevention. Therefore it is important to screen for early detection of frailty in an integrated way as the cluster of clinical manifestations is probably at greater risk for adverse outcomes than any single component [2].",d9f65a60-cdb6-4064-9a50-da4d143614ed

Anthropometric measurements, Adherence to MD and bone health status have been assessed in all subjects involved in the project.  All anthropometric measurements were taken with subjects wearing only light clothes and without shoes. In each subject, weight and height were measured to calculate the body mass index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) [weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2), kg/m2]. Height was measured to the nearest 1 cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer. Body weight was determined to the nearest 50 g using a calibrated balance beam scale.

9,results8,"  A validated 14-item questionnaire for the assessment of adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, PREDIMED (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) [5], was recorded for all the enrolled subjects during a face-to-face interview between the patient and a certified nutritionist or an endocrinologist. Briefly, for each item was assigned score 1 and 0; PREDIMED score was calculated as follows: score 0–5, low adherence; score 6–9, average adherence; score ≥10, high adherence [5].  Quantitative ultrasound (quantitative ultrasound (QUS)) of the mid-calcaneus was performed with the Sahara Clinical Sonometer (Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA). The first US parameters employed for characterizing bone tissues are: Speed of Sound (SoS) and Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (BUA)).",0680942f-1fe8-4c9c-94ca-59c28f972062

Results are expressed as mean ± SD or as median plus range according to variable distributions evaluated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The chi 2 (χ2) test was used to test the significance of differences in frequency distribution. The correlations among variables were performed using Pearson r or Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients. In these analyses, we entered only those variables that had a p-value <0.05.

13,discussion0," Osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures are growing problems within the aging population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality [6]. Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by an imbalance between bone resorption and formation: the rate of bone formation is often normal, whereas resorption by osteoclasts is increased, leading to a decrease in bone mass and microarchitectural alterations that results in bone fragility and increased fragility fractures’ risk [6]. Osteoporosis prevalence rises with advancing age, and in consideration of the demographic transition occurring worldwide it is projected to significantly increase in next future. In Italy, approximately 3.5 million persons are osteoporotic, with over 90.000 fractures yearly in >50 years aged or older population [7]. Almost 50% of women with hip osteoporotic fractures develop disability, with significant impact on independently living and, in most cases, institutionalization [7].",bd086125-f54f-4da2-b1a4-015d67d53b43
14,discussion1," dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) is presently considered the gold standard imaging technique for the diagnosis of osteoporosis because it shows the best predictive value for fracture risk [7]. According to the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)), osteoporosis is defined as a bone mineral density (bone mineral density (BMD)) at the hip and/or the spine at least 2.5 standard deviations below the mean peak bone mass of young healthy adults as determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) [8].  Unfortunately, as other X-ray based techniques, dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) has specific limitations (e.g., use of ionizing radiation, large size of the equipment, high costs, limited availability) that limit its application for population screenings and primary care diagnosis.",3085f2ba-b2f4-461f-9021-77badfc9dc96
15,discussion2," This has lead to an increasing interest in developing reliable pre-screening tools for osteoporosis such as quantitative ultrasound (quantitative ultrasound (QUS)) scanners, which do not involve ionizing radiation exposure and represent a cheaper solution exploiting portable and widely available devices to screen osteoporosis in large population prevention projects, for an early diagnosis of this “silent disease”.  In humans, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) indices were found to be associated with bone mineral density (BMD) as well, moreover quantitative ultrasound (QUS) could predict risk for future fracture. In particular, the calcaneus has been chosen as a site for measurement since it is easily accessible, well-suited for optimizing the geometry of transmission of the US wave through it, and it contains approximately 90% trabecular bone which present a high metabolic turnover rate and a pattern of bone loss similar to the spine.",6ad113ae-fff1-4934-af9c-c0ad04e4d60a
16,discussion3," Monitoring parameters derived are T-score, bone Mineral density (bone mineral density (BMD)) and quantitative ultrasound index (QUI) (Quantitative Ultrasound Index). On the other hand quantitative ultrasound (QUS) is becoming a more and more reliable approach versus DEXA for assessing bone quality even if the US assessment of osteoporosis is currently used only as a pre-screening tool, requiring a subsequent diagnosis confirmation by means of a dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) evaluation [9,10].  A lot of risk factors have been identified for primary osteoporosis (e.g advancing age, female sex, white or asian race, low body weight / body mass index, family history of osteoporotic fractures, early menopause, sedentary lifestyle, excessive alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco use, low calcium and/or vitamin D intake, inadequate sun exposure [7].",1942404f-11c6-42dd-88d6-e70ebc5350e5
17,discussion4,"  Mediterranean diet (MD) represent a healthy eating pattern that is characterized by a high intake of fruit and vegetables, legumes, grains and cereals, fish and seafood and nuts; a low intake of dairy products, meat and meat products; and a moderate ethanol intake mainly in the form of wine and during meals [11]. extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is the main added lipid and its increased consumption is reflected in the high monounsaturated to saturated fatty acid intake [12]. In our study we investigated relationship between adherence to Mediterranean Diet and Bone health. T-score was calculated by calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS); adherence to MD was assessed by PREDIMED Questionnaire. Our population included 87 subjects (4 males and 83 females); 13 subjects (14.9%) resulted osteoporotic; 43 (49.5%) resulted osteopenic; and 31 (35.6%) resulted normal for bone mineral density. Regarding adherence to MD, 9 subjects (10.3%) were poorly adherent; 41 (47.",15d43290-6192-4d1a-8c1a-163fff20b7e1
18,discussion5,"1%) were moderately adherent; 37 (42.5%) were highly adherent.  The interesting finding of our study is that T-score was positively associated with PREDIMED score, in particular the results of our study show that osteoporotic subjects have the lowest PREDIMED score (5.8±2.2), underlying that higher adherence to MD is associated with better bone health status. In the last two decades, several advancements have been realized, which warrant reconsideration of existing dietary strategies for osteoporosis prevention. To date, several studies have related additional nutrients with bone health, such as vitamins A, B, C, E, K; proteins; fats; minerals. It is now well known that an adequate nutrition is important in defining an optimal bone mass, as well as in preventing it [13].  Historically, calcium and vitamin D intake are necessary for good bone health; however, nutritional benefits to bone go beyond these two nutrients.",2d5fbc32-16cc-483b-9099-2ccfda2e4561
19,discussion6," A number of single food components have been suggested to play a role in osteoporosis prevention and several studies evaluated the role of singular nutrients on osteoporosis development [14] but our study, like other few studies, have gone beyond single nutrient associations and linked a dietary patterns (food groups) with bone health [15,16]. Regarding the possible linking between osteoporosis and MD the most likely hypothesis involves inflammatory mechanisms, since chronic inflammation has already been found to be associated with osteoporosis and aging-related bone loss [17,18]. It is well known that MD is associated with reduced risk for metabolic [19, 20], cardiovascular [21, 22], neoplastic [23] and other diseases [24–26], that has consistently been shown to provide a degree of protection against chronic degenerative diseases [27].",f2a640ee-f433-49ee-b920-94331e16c6da
20,discussion7," One of the most accredited explanation of this association is that the high content of different beneficial compounds, such as antioxidants and polyphenols, largely present in Mediterranean foods, such as plant foods, fruits and red wine, have anti-inflammatory properties. In particular, the monounsaturated fatty acids intake, whose major source is represented by extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), was found to be associated with a reduced prevalence of risk factors for major chronic inflammatory diseases [28]. Another significant aspect of this study is that PREDIMED Questionnaire, as well as as calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS), represents a very reliable screening approach. PREDIMED appraises adherence to MD using only a brief 14-item questionnaire which is less time-demanding, less expensive and requires less collaboration from participants than the usual full-length food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) or other more comprehensive methods [29].",94b515d5-c795-4b93-b290-30ecc0a0b833
21,discussion8," Moreover, this questionnaire allows to provide feedback to the participant immediately after the interview is completed. In fact, this 14-item tool is a key element in the intervention conducted in the PREDIMED trial and has been previously validated against the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used in the study [30].

22,conclusion0,"These preliminary data show a significant correlation between adherence to Mediterranean Diet and bone health parameters such as T-score assessed by calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS). The association between Mediterranean Diet and bone health highlights the potential beneficial effects of primary nutritional interventions promoting a Mediterranean food pattern rich in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), fruits, vegetables, fish, chicken and whole grains, as a sustainable and safe adjuvant treatment in general population and in older adults in particular. Moreover, our study highlights the reliability of the assessment of bone impairment by calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to screen for and prevent frailty through community-based screening services, although we are aware that the reduced sample size and the validity of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) in diagnosing osteoporosis might be a limitation of our study.",ab8eee7a-015d-4202-98a8-e0f89c9f3045
