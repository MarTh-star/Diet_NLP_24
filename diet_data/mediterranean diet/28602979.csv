0,methods0,An EMBASE search was conducted up to December 2017 in order to identify epidemiological studies on MD and OA. The search strategy applied was as follows: (‘osteoarthritis’/exp/mj OR ‘osteoarthritis’/major focus term (mj)) AND (‘Mediterranean diet’/exp/mj OR ‘Mediterranean diet’/mj). All human epidemiological studies with full texts were considered. Additional papers were identified during the manual search process. Exclusion criteria were applied to selected studies: studies in languages other than English and studies evaluating nutrients or foods individually. The Prisma guidelines were followed during our review [34].  The quality of the studies included in the review was analyzed using the relevant tool for cross-sectional studies [35].,3dd68ba5-879f-4498-ba8e-783c72519e31
1,methods1," For the randomized controlled trial, we assessed the risk of bias (low, high or unclear) for the following domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of assessments, incomplete outcome data, and selective Newcastle-Ottawa Scale outcome reporting [36]. The study was classified as having a high risk of bias if any one domain was at high risk of bias and a low risk of bias if four or five domains were classified as at low risk. Otherwise, the risk of bias for the trial was considered to be unclear.  3. Results The EMBASE search strategy (‘osteoarthritis’/exp/mj OR ‘osteoarthritis’/mj) AND (‘Mediterranean diet’/exp/mj OR ‘Mediterranean diet’/mj) yielded a total of eight articles. After applying the selection criteria, three publications were selected. The flowchart showing the procedures for selecting the studies is shown in Figure 1. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the selected articles and Table S2 shows a summary of their main findings [37,38,39].",9cf9d9a9-3b78-4092-bef5-f279047fba64
2,methods2," Two articles reported cross-sectional data from the same study, namely the Osteoarthritis Initiative conducted in the USA [38,39], while the third was a randomized controlled trial [37]. The risk of bias was fair in both cross-sectional studies and unclear in the randomized controlled trial.  .  3.1. Characteristics of the Study Sample The studies were conducted between 2004–2013 in the UK and North America. The cross-sectional study was evaluated between more than 4000 participants, while the randomized control trial included 124 patients. In each study, a different principal variable of OA was analyzed: biomarkers and range of motion of knee and hip, OA prevalence and quality of life. All studies were published in last two years [37,38,39].  3.2. Evaluation of MD In the Dyer et al. (2017) article, the participants in the diet group were provided with nutritional information and dietary advice regarded as adequately informative for patients from non-Mediterranean countries.",a40df978-b086-4997-9764-c4deaf0fcc19
3,methods3," All participants were asked to complete a 7-day food diary and a score to evaluate their compliance with the diet was calculated [37].  Veronese et al. (2016) analyzed the dietary patterns using the Block Brief 200 food-frequency questionnaire. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was calculated using the scoring system proposed by Panangiotakos et al. (aMED) [38,39,40].  3.3. Prevalence of OA in Participants with High Adherence to MD The prevalence of knee OA was significantly lower in participants with higher aMED (OR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.69–0.99, p = 0.04). When the effects of individual components of MD and their association with the presence of knee OA were analyzed, only a higher consumption of cereals was associated with a significantly reduced probability of knee OA (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60–0.98; p = 0.03) [38].  3.4.",47538472-bdf9-4fde-b40e-01b045ba6920
4,methods4," Quality of Life and MD Adherence Quality of life was investigated as a primary outcome through the 12-Item Short-Form Health Outcome Survey (SF-12), which has a physical (physical (PCS)) and mental (mental (MCS)) composite scale. The scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. Participants with higher aMED had significantly higher SF-12: SF-12-physical (PCS) (Q5 50 ± 8.5 vs. Q1 47.2 ± 9.8 p < 0.0001) and SF-12mental (MCS) (Q5 54.5 ± 7.6 vs. Q1 53.2 ± 8.8 p < 0.0001) [38].  The presence of any depressive symptoms was analyzed using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) instrument [41]. Higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms. Participants with higher aMED had lower CES-D scores (β −0.05; 95% CI: −0.09, −0.01; p < 0.05) [38].",5977f4d3-514e-4de6-ac80-a9a35ba76f86
5,methods5,"  Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC)) is a validated scale for assessing the presence of pain, stiffness and disability caused by OA. Participants with higher aMED had a significantly lower Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) in both knees for subscales of pain (Right knee −0.02 (−0.04, −0.01); p = 0.008)/(Left knee −0.02 (−0.04, −0.003); p = 0.02) and disability (Right knee −0.08 (−0.14, −0.03); p = 0.004)/Left Knee −0.07 (−0.14, −0.01); p = 0.02) but not for stiffness (p > 0.05) [38].  The Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (AIMS2) is a disease-specific measure of the physical, social, and emotional well-being designed as a measure of outcome in arthritis. It encompasses nine scales: mobility, physical activity (walking, bending, lifting), dexterity, household activity, social activities, daily living activities, pain, depression, and anxiety. Dyer et al.",7bdf6bba-499f-4fdb-aa3d-5a57f5e2d3f6
6,methods6," (2017) compared AIMS2 in the diet and control groups and no significant associations emerged [37].  Dyer et al. (2017) compared the range of motion of the lower extremities in both the diet (MD diet) and control groups. Knee flexion and hip rotation in the diet group were better than those observed in the control group (122 ± 18 vs. 116 ± 29; p = 0.072) 52 ± 19 vs. 46 ± 24; p = 0.010). No significant differences between groups were observed in terms of index finger movement and hip flexion (p > 0.05) [37].  3.5. Markers of Inflammation and Cartilage Degradation The serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP) and inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors have been linked to OA. Dyer et al. (2017) analyzed different biomarkers in participants with OA in both the Diet and Control groups: sCOMP, IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, VEGF, EGF and soluble receptors (IL-6sR, IL-2sR, TNF-sR1 and TNF-sR2, plus MCP-1, and MMP-9).",e5035e26-0a15-43ed-9f6a-1bfb10587b9c
7,methods7," Significant differences between groups were only detected in IL1-α (p = 0.019), which decreased in the diet group, but which showed no change in the control group [37].  4. Discussion The findings of this systematic review indicate positive associations between MD and improved quality of life in participants with OA [37,38,39]. The prevalence of osteoarthritis was lower in participants with high aMED [38]. Biomarkers of inflammation and cartilage degradation related to OA were also analyzed and significant differences were detected for IL1-α (p = 0.019), which was lower in the diet group [37].  There are several physiological explanations that could explain why key components of MD might protect against OA. OA is often referred to as a degenerative joint disease. This is inaccurate since OA is not simply a process of wear and tear. Chronic low-grade inflammation has been described as a key mediator of the pathogenesis of OA [42].",3eca65e7-ae5b-4b55-9025-faa7dbe0e5d8
8,methods8," In fact, elevated serum levels of the C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, are predictive of the development and progression of OA [43]. Inflammation in OA joints is distinct from that in rheumatoid arthritis as it is chronic, low grade and mediated by innate immunity [42]. Different studies have shown that the presence of synovial inflammation, or synovitis, in OA is associated with increased severity of joint symptoms, increased cartilage loss, decreased mobility, and elevated radiographic grades [44,45,46]. Most likely, not only local but also systemic inflammation is related to OA development [47]. Obesity induces low-grade systemic inflammation caused by the secretion of proinflammatory adipokines and cytokines, which both contribute to joint degeneration during OA [17,18]. The cytokines from the synovial fluid contribute to cartilage matrix loss by stimulating chondrocyte catabolic activity and inhibiting anabolic activity [48,49].",c7914903-6b58-42d6-b84d-2d2cafe74faf
9,methods9," Thus, the known association between a higher adherence to a MD and lower level markers of inflammation could explain some of the benefits [50,51,52]. Some studies have found that consuming MD reduces weight and IL-6 levels. This effect is greater if it is accompanied by exercise [53,54].  Several studies have described an increased risk of OA in association with such metabolic risk factors as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance, which characterize the MetS [20,55,56,57]. The prevalence of MetS in patients with OA is 59% and in the general population 23% [55]. Patients with OA and MetS suffer an increased incidence of inflammation and pain compared to OA patients without MetS [58,59]. The treatment of MetS has been proposed as measure to delay the progression of OA [60].  The MD has been shown not only to reverse MetS [61,62,63,64], but also to improve quality of life [65,66].",76560867-a840-477c-b896-844f22369ab9
10,methods10," On the other hand, olive oil, which is an important component of MD, has proven to be efficient in reducing pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores and in improving the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index in patients with OA [67,68,69,70].  This body of evidence suggests that MD may reduce the prevalence of OA and improve the quality of life in these patients because of its anti-inflammatory effects. The absence of differences between the Diet and Control groups in terms of the biomarkers is probably a consequence of the short period of exposition to MD (only 16 weeks) or to the difficulties in adopting a MD in non-Mediterranean countries [71].  5. Conclusions The findings of this systematic review should be weighed against certain limitations. Only three papers met the inclusion criteria. Two of the studies were of cross-sectional design (and evaluated the same population group) while the third was a randomized trial.",df7a6525-ee16-4f1e-aeb3-68bfc0d1fc0d
11,methods11," There are important methodological differences in the studies that make it difficult to compare their results. In conclusion, the three studies included in this systematic review demonstrate some relation between OA and adherence to the MD. However, the epidemiological evidence is limited, and longer interventions are required to evaluate the long-term efficacy of the MD for improving symptomatology and preventing OA.
