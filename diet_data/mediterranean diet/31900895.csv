Study Design and Subjects  In the period between June 2019 and December 2019, we consecutively enrolled in the study all the women who voluntarily came up at the Section of Clinical Nutrition and Nutrigenomics, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention of the University of Rome Tor Vergata for nutritional medical check-up.  According to health status, the patients were separated into two groups. The lipoedema patients (LIPPY) group was represented by women with the diagnosis of lipoedema made at the San Giovanni Battista Hospital in Rome (Italy); the control group (CTRL) group included patients not affected by lipoedema. For both groups, inclusion criteria were as follows: Italian Caucasian females older than 18 years old with the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) > 18.",f1e24c49-89aa-4b0d-9612-043bfd00b4b2

According to the inclusion criteria, the subjects eligible for study underwent a medical examination and a complete evaluation of their nutritional status, body composition and basal metabolism at baseline and after four weeks. The mMeD was carried out for four weeks to avoid dropout and ensure maximum adherence to treatment. Moreover, to ensure adherence to the diet, patients were monitored during the four weeks by telephone interview once a week. The patients were asked about their food intake with a 48-h recall, the possible presence of side effects and a general opinion on the satisfaction with the diet.  All the enrolled patients signed a consent form following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.",e40f55c4-b8fd-4c17-b0d4-3f7c8d613340
2,methods2," The approval by the Ethics Committee of the Calabria Region Center Area Section (Register Protocol No. 146 17/05/2018) was obtained.  2.2. Anthropometrics and Body Composition  After a 12-h overnight fast, an anthropometric evaluation was carried out for each patient. Body weight and height were measured using a scale and a stadiometer (Invernizzi, Rome, Italy) while the subject was standing wearing underwear. The data were collected to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm, respectively. Neck, waist and hip circumferences were measured with a flexible and non-extensible metric tape.  body mass index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (kg)/height (m)2 and classified according to the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) [24]. A waist to hip circumferences ratio (waist to hip circumferences ratio (WHR)) was evaluated according to the clinical risk thresholds equivalent to waist to hip circumferences ratio (WHR)  >  0.85 for women [24].",33f3a58b-3375-41bd-a878-df05122877d4
3,methods3,"  Body composition was evaluated according to the standard method [18]. The patients were asked to remove all clothing (except underwear), shoes and any metal objects. Whole and segmental FM (kg) was evaluated by dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Primus, X-ray densitometer; software version 1.2.2, Osteosys Co., Ltd., Guro-gu, Seoul, Korea) [25]. The effective radiation dose for this procedure is about 0.01 mSv. The intra- and inter-subject coefficient of variation (CV% = 100 SD/mean) ranged from 1 to 5%. The coefficients on this instrument for five participants scanned six times over a 9-month period were 2.2% for FM and 1.1% for free fat mass (free fat mass (FFM)) and LM.",17cc6009-2c8d-4925-8dbf-f1ac07bf1914

Intermuscular adipose tissue (Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT)) was calculated according to Colica et al. with the following formulas: Log (Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT)) = −2.21 + (0.12 × fat) + (−0.0013 × fat2) for women [26].  Bioelectrical impedance analysis (Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)) (Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)101S, Akern/RJL Systems, Florence, Italy) was employed to measure resistance (Rz), reactance (Xc), total body water (TBW, L), extracellular body water (ECW, L) [25].  2.3.",39307503-e6eb-4367-8eee-667392e384f9
5,methods5," Indirect Calorimetry  Indirect calorimetry was performed to measure oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) according to De Lorenzo et al. [27] and to calculate the resting energy expenditure (resting energy expenditure (REE)) using a Vyntus CPX Canopy (CareFusion, Höchberg, Germany) with the Sentry Suite™ software (CareFusion, Höchberg, Germany). A gas mixture with 12.0% O2, 5.0% CO2, balanced with N2 was used. After a steady-state condition, when no variation over ± 5% occurred, VO2 and VCO2 values were recorded.  The measurement was performed after fasting for 12 h. The subjects were asked to lie down on a laboratory bed in a supine position for 25–30 min in a suitable room (quiet, with an ambient temperature of 22 °C).  The resting energy expenditure (REE) was determined using the Weir formula [28]:resting energy expenditure (REE) = ((3.94 × VO2) + (1.106 × VCO2)) × 1.44.",62cb85f8-b717-4fd0-97f0-747ce20e2c79
6,methods6,"  The daily energy requirements were calculated by multiplying resting energy expenditure (REE) by the proper physical activity level (physical activity level (PAL)) [29].  2.4. Dietary Assessments  At baseline and during the mMeD, eating habits of the subjects were evaluated through accurate data collection. Subject’s food intake was assessed with a 3 days/week diet record, 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day, completed for 3 weeks, for a total of 9 days [24].  A food frequency questionnaire was used to identify the weekly frequency of intake of different foods (Appendix A) [30].  2.5. Dietary Intervention  All the enrolled subjects received the same hypocaloric mMeD with a caloric restriction of about 20% compared to the daily energy requirements, personalized according to each patient’s energy requirements and LM content. Therefore, the mMeD considered the need of macro- and micronutrient and caloric intake based on the individual characteristics of body composition and basal metabolism.",de564376-dcdc-4aa7-a227-b7a22aec34e1
7,methods7," The diet indicated for each day of the week the foods to be consumed divided into 5 meals a day. The average caloric distribution of the meals was as follows: 15%—breakfast, 10%—morning snack, 35%—lunch, 10%—afternoon snack, 30%—dinner.  The mMeD’s daily macronutrient intake was broken down as follows: 40–45% of total kcal/day of carbohydrates, 25–30% of total kcal/day of proteins (>50% of them vegetable-derived), 25–30% of total kcal/day of lipids (in the total daily energy intake: saturated fat < 10%, 6–10% polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)), n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio of 3:1, 15% monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)), <1% trans-fatty acids) and 25 g of fiber.  The daily protein intake was 2 g/kg of the total LM, according to Colica et al. [26].

The main features of the mMeD are as follows: primarily plant-based foods such as seasonal fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts; replacement of butter with healthy fats such as olive oil; use of herbs and spices instead of salt; foods rich in polyunsaturated fats. Preserved and processed foods such as cold cuts, cured meats and canned products, frozen ready meals, cheese (apart from ricotta), potatoes, high glycemic index (GI) carbohydrates, alcoholic and non-alcoholic sweetened drinks were avoided.  The Mediterranean adequacy index (Mediterranean adequacy index (MAI)) [31] was calculated using the ratio of the caloric intake (%kcal/day) derived from carbohydrates and typical Mediterranean foods (like bread, pasta, vegetables, fruit, extra virgin olive oil, fish, red wine) and non-typical ones (like meat, milk and dairy products, eggs, sugar, sweets and alcohol) [32].",b0f60701-86f5-4e06-8446-633bb1e94974
9,methods9," Mediterranean adequacy index (MAI) values are considered acceptable when the value is >5, and 100% adequate >15. Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC)) of the diet was calculated using the diet analyzer software package Dietosystem® (version 12.00.13, DS Medica SRL, Milan, Italy) to evaluate the protection provided by antioxidant compounds from food [22].  2.6. Quality of Life  The quality of life was assessed by using the “European Quality of Life” tool (EQ-5D) [33,34].  The EQ-5D consists of two distinct sections. In the first one, a subjective evaluation for 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) is requested. For each one, it is possible to choose a level of severity ranging from 1 to 3: level 1 (no problem); level 2 (some trouble); level 3 (extreme limitation). The combination of all the answers forms a 5-digit number that represents the patient’s general health status.",3b5e186d-026a-4770-af14-af1c63eb8b99
10,methods10," The three response levels for each of the 5 dimensions produce a maximum of 243 possible descriptions of the health status and allow highlighting the presence/absence of any problem and its intensity. The second section of the EQ-5D includes a visual analogue scale (visual analogue scale (VAS)) graphically represented by a graduated scale ranging from 0 (the worst possible state of health) to 100 (the best possible state of health), on which a patient indicates her/his perceived level of health. For the present analysis, the scores obtained from the first and the second part at baseline and after four weeks were compared to evaluate any improvement regarding the general state of health as well as the pain, the malaise and the psychological aspects related to anxiety and depression.  2.7.",5d3108fb-5413-4c05-8e1f-967b764f9404
11,methods11," Fibromyalgia Assessment Status  Since patients affected by lipoedema usually present pain similar to those of fibromyalgia in their body, the Fibromyalgia Assessment Status (Fibromyalgia Assessment Status (FAS)) tool was used to evaluate the effect of the diet on pain and feeling of fatigue [35]. The Fibromyalgia Assessment Status (FAS) is a simple self-administered assessment that combines the patient’s evaluation of fatigue and sleep disturbance (2 items, score ranging from 0 to 10) and pain assessed on the basis of 16 non-articular sites listed on the self-assessment pain scale (self assessment pain scale (SAPS)) (score ranging from 0 to 3) in a unique tool.  2.8.

At baseline, the differences between lipoedema patients (LIPPY) and control group (CTRL) were assessed by the independent samples t-test and the Mann–Whitney test. Subsequently, the t-Test for related samples or the Wilcoxon rank test were used to assess the presence of differences in the variables examined between the baseline and after four weeks. Conclusively, for each study variable, to compare the trend over time, ∆% was calculated equal to the percentage variation of each parameter calculated as an absolute margin of variation from the baseline value. The differences in ∆% between the baseline and after four weeks among groups were assessed with one-way ANOVA. Results were significant for p-value < 0.05. All p-values shown are two-tailed.

Figure 1 depicts different stages of lipoedema identified in the lipoedema patients (LIPPY) group: 14.3% of the patients were in stage 1, 42.8% of them were in stage 2, 28.6% of them were in stage 3, 14.3% of them were in stage 4.  At baseline, no statistical differences were observed between groups for age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), circumferences, Rz, TBW parameters.

No clinically significant modification were observed regarding the visual analogue scale (VAS) (baseline: 64.7 ± 18.3; 4 weeks: 69.9 ± 18.3; p = 0.47), the fibromyalgia severity scale index (p = 0.21) and the Fibromyalgia Assessment Status scale (p = 0.75).",501b3c6a-7a93-4289-a7a3-1613c50b4e83
18,methods19," No significant results were observed in the control group (CTRL) group related to EQ-5D, visual analogue scale (VAS), fibromyalgia severity scale index and Fibromyalgia Assessment Status scale, probably because these subjects did not usually experience pain or other discomfort in their daily life (data not shown).  4. Discussion  For the improvement of the quality of life of lipoedema patients (LIPPY) patients, it is essential to find a dietary strategy that can be accepted and followed, aimed not only at weight loss and reducing FM in the areas of the lower and upper limbs, but above all at the reduction of pain that is accompanied by the expansion of inflamed subcutaneous tissue and orthostatic edema [36,37]. Moreover, weight gain should be avoided to prevent edema worsening [38].",6816b145-d40e-4e96-af1d-55d22faaaa9f
19,methods20,"  The main aim of lipoedema treatment should also target factors which negatively influence lipoedema (such as obesity, the presence of lymphatic or venous edema, incorrect insight into the condition and decreased level of physical activity). It was therefore hypothesized that a low-calorie diet plan based on foods rich in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecules [22] could contribute to the well-being of lipoedema patients (LIPPY) patients and healthy lifestyle [39]. Therefore, the goal of the mMeD was to reduce consumption of saturated fatty acids and preserved foods [20]. The mMeD included wholesome foods, mostly plant-based, a large number of vegetables and fruits and fermented foods to obtain an increase in Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) units per day and the right dosage of food antioxidants [22]. Moreover, sugars, chemically modified fats and processed foods were eliminated. Animal proteins were decreased in favor of plant-based proteins (Table 1).",742e7ffb-dc4e-4180-b7cd-9233982dd021
20,methods21," The ω6/ω3 ratio was markedly changed with respect to the baseline (lipoedema patients (LIPPY) and control group (CTRL): p < 0.0001) thanks to the addition of foods with a high concentration of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as fish and nuts that play an important role in the regulatory process of inflammation by promoting an anti-inflammatory effect [21]. As fibers are involved in the modulation process of inflammation, immune system and microbiota equilibrium [22], fiber consumption from fruits and whole grains was significantly increased with respect to the baseline (lipoedema patients (LIPPY) and control group (CTRL): p < 0.0001). The mMeD content of molecules with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity [32] such as vitamins A (lipoedema patients (LIPPY) and control group (CTRL): p < 0.05), C (lipoedema patients (LIPPY): p < 0.0001, control group (CTRL): p < 0.05), D (lipoedema patients (LIPPY) and control group (CTRL): p < 0.",c7fd9c65-69c2-4125-8e07-658be848794b
21,methods22,"05) and minerals [40,41,42] was significant increased with respect to the baseline, with amelioration of the Mediterranean adequacy index (MAI) index (lipoedema patients (LIPPY) and control group (CTRL): p < 0.0001).  At baseline, no differences in age and anthropometric parameters were observed between the two groups. However, lipoedema patients (LIPPY) women had significantly higher values of leg compartments with respect to the control group (CTRL) group (data not shown), as already expected for this pathology. Moreover, the FM (kg and %) of legs and the FM (%) of arms were higher in the lipoedema patients (LIPPY) group with respect to the control group (CTRL), confirming that lipoedema affects mainly upper and lower limbs. Therefore, an expected result was waist to hip circumferences ratio (WHR) lower in the lipoedema patients (LIPPY) group than in the control group (CTRL) group due to characteristic fat deposition of this disease [43].",90de73b8-f3a3-4374-8a29-db3187e2be96
22,methods23," Regarding the Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) results, the lipoedema patients (LIPPY) group presented lower Xc values with respect to the control group (CTRL) group, and consequently a higher ECW value. This is probably related to increased fat deposition in legs with a consequent expansion of the ECW compartment [44].  In both groups, weight and body mass index (BMI) were significantly decreased after four weeks of the mMeD without differences in Δ% between the two groups (Table 2). In the control group (CTRL) group, weight loss was reflected in reduction of all body composition parameters and related circumferences. After the mMeD, lipoedema patients (LIPPY) patients showed only a decrease of FM in upper and lower limbs and a decrease of LM in legs, without significant differences in Δ% with respect to the control group (CTRL) group (Table 3).",822eb84d-1f4c-47f0-8fd2-83b29f7f0997
23,methods24," In the control group (CTRL) group, we observed that truncal fat was the compartment characterized by the highest loss, as previously demonstrated [25,45]. Moreover, our results do not confirm the statement of Wold et al. [46], according to whom women affected by lipoedema are characterized by low resting energy expenditure (REE) [27,47].  Although the loss of FM in the upper and lower limbs was observed in both groups, the statistical non-significance of Δ% reinforces the observed data. For the first time a diet such as the mMeD has been shown to be effective in reducing FM in the typical points of lipoedema, such as in women not affected by this disease. Loss of upper and lower limbs’ fat can probably be the key to decreasing symptoms in lipoedema. For the first time, an increase in the lipoedema patients (LIPPY) patients’ ability to perform various daily physical activities after a diet therapy was observed.",1fb254c9-47cd-4fc8-bb49-ec0c9943112e
24,methods25," According to the EQ-5D scale results, the possibility of those patients to perform simple daily activities with less fatigue, pain and anxiety is highlighted due to their body condition probably improving their perception of the quality of life. This might reflect a positive response to the mMeD, allowing a higher quality of daily life [11].  The limitations of the study were the small number of participants, though the number of patients is sufficient for rare pathology studies such as lipoedema-and short intervention period. Therefore, we enrolled all the available patients without differentiating them by disease stages and determining as a consequence a wide variance in body mass index (BMI). Since lipoedema is a rare adipose disorder characterized by expansion of the Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT), the body mass index (BMI) cannot be considered an indicator of obesity, as obesity itself may or may not overlap.",4d49af62-018e-4bf4-a94f-bb53d56f49da
25,methods26," The intervention period was a mandatory choice because it was the period of greatest adherence to the prescribed diet therapy. Despite the bias linked to the self-reporting of dietary intake, the data discussed make it possible to notice that the mMeD showed increased antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutritional indexes. However, more data are needed for a larger population, and long-term interventions are required. Moreover, future studies of different types of diet therapies such as low-carb, high-fat or focused on specific antioxidant micronutrients, as compared to a control group following a normal diet, will be necessary to evaluate efficacy of pain management as related to weight and FM loss. Finally, in order to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of the diet, further studies directly measuring the inflammatory and oxidative status of the patients should be performed.",56fabe37-0498-44e3-9312-92e0a306d941
26,methods27,"  In conclusion, the strength of this study was the adherence of lipoedema patients (LIPPY) patients to the mMeD; this improved overall nutritional status and quality of life, reducing weight, arms’ and legs’ FM. Although more studies are recommended to investigate whether the increase in the antioxidant capacity corresponds to weight loss, our study highlighted that the mMeD with high values of Mediterranean adequacy index (MAI) [48] and Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) [22] could be a nutritional strategy for lipoedema treatment.
