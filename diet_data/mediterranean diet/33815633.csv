Each participant consumed three different iso-energetic meals (4300 kJ): a Western diet-like high-fat meal (Western diet like high fat meal (WDHF)), a Western diet-like high-carbohydrate meal (Western diet like high carbohydrate meal (WDHC)) and a Mediterranean diet-like meal (meal (MED)). Blood samples were collected when fasted and hourly for 5 h postprandially and analyzed for glucose, insulin, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and endothelial adhesion molecules. Based on fasting serum C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) concentrations, participants were assigned to a high inflammation (C reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 2.0 mg/L; n = 30) or low inflammation (C reactive protein (CRP) < 2.0 mg/L; n = 30) group, and postprandial outcomes were compared.",8aed962d-3391-4cd9-892b-9b62c155030c

Details of the study design and subject recruitment, enrollment and randomization have been described previously [5]. In brief, interested volunteers (n = 127) aged 60–80 years with a BMI > 27 kg/m2 attended screening, which included physical assessments, laboratory assessments, medical history and a dietary questionnaire. Overweight or obese participants were included if they had the following traits of metabolic syndrome: (1) visceral fat distribution (waist circumference ≥ 94 cm for men and ≥ 80 cm for women); (2) pre-hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 120–139 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 80–89 mmHg) or hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140–159 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90–99 mmHg); and (3) at least one of the following criteria: impaired glucose tolerance (fasting plasma glucose ≥ 5.55 mmol/L) and/or dyslipidemia (fasting serum triglycerides ≥ 1.",6df4e079-eb62-43a3-9343-9a2bf85b4f94

3,methods3," Participants were assigned to the three different test meals by block randomization. Venous blood sampling was conducted prior to the test meal (0 h) and at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h after finishing the test meal. Participants consumed an iso-energetic and iso-nitrogen test meal at each visit. The test meals were representative of real-life dietary intake: a Western diet-like high-fat (Western diet like high fat meal (WDHF)) meal (rich in total fat, SFA, and animal protein), a Western diet-like high-carbohydrate (Western diet like high carbohydrate meal (WDHC)) meal (rich in refined carbohydrates) and a Mediterranean diet-like (meal (MED)) meal (rich in unsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber, and antioxidants). The energy and macronutrient composition of the meals are shown in Table 1, and detailed descriptions of meal composition are presented in Schönknecht et al. [5].

5,methods5," Serum total cholesterol was measured using polychromatic endpoint measurement, whereas serum HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were assessed using endpoint measurement with a Dimension Vista 1500 analyser (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). Plasma glucose was assessed via bichromatic endpoint measurement (Dimension Vista 1500 analyser), and serum insulin was determined using chemiluminescent-immunometric assay (Immulite 2000 analyzer, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). Serum C reactive protein (CRP) (high sensitive, hs) was determined using a turbidimetric immunoassay (Cobas 8000 modular analyser series). Hs-interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and hs-interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble adhesion molecules E-selectin (sE-selectin), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) were analyzed using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassay kits (R&D Systems) [5].

6,analysis0," Based on C reactive protein (CRP) assessment at screening visit, participants were divided into (i) high inflammation (defined as fasting serum C reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 2 mg/L) and (ii) low inflammation (fasting C reactive protein (CRP) < 2 mg/L) groups [7, 8]. Postprandial responses were analyzed and compared between both groups using SPSS statistical software package (version 23; IBM). Proinflammatory state-related differences between the baseline characteristics at screening were analyzed using unpaired Student’s t tests. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. Prior to analyses, the glucose, insulin and hs-C reactive protein (CRP) data were log-transformed.  Postprandial outcomes were tested for effects of inflammatory state, time and test meal by performing linear mixed models.

Residuals obtained from the calculations were inspected for normality to control for the fit of the statistical model. Logarithmic transformation was applied before analysis if the residuals were not normally distributed, which was true for glucose, insulin, IL-6, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 data.  The incremental AUC (iAUC) was calculated for the concentration of all postprandial parameters as a summary variable. Calculations were performed as reported previously [5].

12,discussion0," The present report is a secondary analysis using data from the Diet–Body–Brain (DietBB) postprandial study conducted in 60 older individuals with a cluster of metabolic syndrome traits [5]. We found that the relative magnitude of the inflammatory response to meal intake, measured by changes in plasma IL-6 concentrations over a 5-h period, was similar between subjects with and without proinflammatory markers. In addition, glucose response to a Western diet like high carbohydrate meal (WDHC) meal was higher and more prolonged in participants in a proinflammatory state.  Our data indicate that relative postprandial inflammatory response intensity is not related to fasting inflammatory status in overweight/obese subjects with metabolic syndrome traits. The current literature on the impact of meals on inflammatory outcomes according to basal inflammatory status is extremely limited. Phillips et al.",5d47b2d5-dd79-477e-a934-7764c542a0ad
13,discussion1," [9] assessed the effect of a high-fat meal on markers of inflammation in (i) lean, (ii) obese non-diabetic and (iii) type 2 diabetic men. In accordance with our data, obese non-diabetic men presented an inflammatory state, indicated by higher fasting hs-C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations than lean men (0.2 vs. 1.3 mg/L). Absolute concentrations of IL-6 following the high-fat meal increased in all groups, but there were no differences in response slopes relative to fasting values between groups. In contrast to our study, baseline IL-6 concentrations did not differ between groups [9]; however, the study was limited to males, baseline characteristics (e.g., age, BMI, body composition) differed between groups, and the sample size was small (n = 10 per group).  Another study compared postprandial vascular, inflammatory and leukocyte adherence responses between lean and obese men in an inflammatory state after high-fat milkshakes [10].",6e96e62c-627c-48ba-b9b3-cf7f64b6d94e
14,discussion2," No differences in postprandial responses between lean and obese participants were observed. Likewise, Schwander et al. [11] challenged 19 normal-weight and 18 obese men with 2100, 4300 and 6300 kJ high-fat meals. Fasting concentrations of C reactive protein (CRP) (0.9 ± 0.9 vs. 3.0 ± 3.0 mg/L), but not IL-6, differed between groups. None of the energy doses led to the identification of a significant difference in the postprandial response of inflammatory markers between normal-weight and obese participants. These data confirm that the higher absolute postprandial IL-6 concentrations we observed resulted from an overweight/obesity-induced basal inflammatory state, rather than an amplified inflammatory response. The functions and mechanism of action of IL-6 are complex, meaning that elevated IL-6 concentrations in the basal state do not necessarily result in an augmented postprandial inflammatory response.",52559603-7066-4792-a951-cd408618811f
15,discussion3," In addition, the metabolic effects of IL-6 depend on the cellular environment and the concentration [12].  Interleukin-6 is the most frequently assessed marker of inflammation in the postprandial period and consistently increases between 4 and 8 h after intake of a high-fat meal [13]. Elevated IL-6 concentrations have been linked to multiple clinical parameters (e.g., blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and coronary artery disease) [13]. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, have been implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis [14] and type 2 diabetes [15, 16]. Although more research is needed regarding the clinical relevance of short-term IL-6 fluctuations after meal intake, one may speculate that over the course of a day, accumulation of IL-6 resulting from repeated meal intake may trigger metabolic dysmetabolism, atherosclerosis and diabetes progression.",e21ea9ca-a082-4833-9e69-42305ffee473
16,discussion4,"  Our data also indicate that basal inflammatory state influences postprandial glucose response. Participants from the high inflammation group had higher glucose concentrations over the postprandial period than the low inflammation group. Interestingly, this finding was only observed after Western diet like high carbohydrate meal (WDHC) meal intake, not after Western diet like high fat meal (WDHF) and meal (MED) meal intake, indicating that the inflammation-related impairment of the glycaemic response may be associated with the amount of carbohydrate consumed. These group differences may be reasoned by the association of low-grade inflammation with insulin resistance [17–19]. The subjects in the high-inflammatory group show elevated concentrations of inflammation markers (hs-C reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6), with the consequence of postprandially impaired insulin sensitivity and subsequently decreased glucose uptake.",4bb14658-519f-42f3-9841-9b9492b46136
17,discussion5," The repeated exposure to postprandial increased glycemia represents the contribution of low-grade inflammation to insulin resistance.  One mechanism potentially linking the higher glycaemic response in participants from the high inflammation group is the interference by cytokines in insulin action. Proinflammatory signaling molecules activate certain inflammatory pathways, which interfere with intracellular insulin-receptor signaling by activating serine kinases, directly blocking insulin action [1, 2, 18]. Chronically elevated IL-6 concentrations in the basal inflammatory state are associated with substantial metabolic effects, e.g., systemic insulin resistance [19]. In vitro and in vivo models show that insulin action is inhibited in adipocytes, hepatocytes and endothelial cells exposed to cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) [20] and other proinflammatory mediators [21–23].",b1bb9075-4310-4df2-bb71-5673520f19e9
18,discussion6,"  To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to report that, relative to baseline levels, inflammatory responses to meal intake are similar between subjects with and without a proinflammatory phenotype. One strength of our study is that we focused on a clinically relevant population, i.e., overweight/obese older individuals, and that we used a whole-diet approach to study acute effects of meals on several cardiometabolic parameters [5]. In addition, retrospective division of the 60 participants into high and low inflammation groups based on baseline C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations resulted in evenly distributed (n = 30 per group) groups with similar anthropometric and metabolic characteristics. Furthermore, assessment over 5 h is adequate to cover most postprandial responses, and parameters were measured hourly, allowing in-depth evaluation of postprandial kinetics.",060c8a91-ed18-487f-a172-f05cc2b7adac
19,discussion7,"  One limitation of the present work is that it is an exploratory, and thus secondary, data analysis. The study was originally designed to investigate the effects of three different meal patterns on postprandial lipemic, glycemic and inflammatory responses; thus, the presented data are ancillary examinations. In addition, we only selected plasma/serum markers (cytokines and adhesion markers) to characterize the inflammatory response. Currently, no consensus exists regarding inflammatory mediators that best represent low-grade inflammation [1, 24]. In addition, we are far from a consensus regarding response features (i.e., timing and magnitude) after a meal of even the most commonly assessed markers of inflammation [13]. Future postprandial studies should include further biomarkers, such as the examination of immune cell-activation of inflammatory gene expression profiles or inflammatory omic responses [24].",81d3a2e4-9607-4297-a11f-dfa87be1e070
20,discussion8," Also, further biomarkers, such as galectin-3, may be considered in postprandial studies to examine the relation between low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance [19]  In conclusion, our data indicate that individuals in a proinflammatory state have higher absolute cytokine blood concentrations postprandially than individuals without elevated proinflammatory markers. The magnitude of the inflammatory response relative to baseline levels was similar between groups, demonstrated by IL-6 concentrations increasing equally for individuals in the high and low inflammation groups. In addition, the glucose response to a Western diet like high carbohydrate meal (WDHC) meal was higher and more prolonged in participants in a proinflammatory state. These data suggest that low-grade inflammation may contribute to short-term insulin signaling impairment during the postprandial period, thereby leading to augmented postprandial glucose responses.",226ddcd3-72c0-4bc5-9403-9ac7f7b554ed
