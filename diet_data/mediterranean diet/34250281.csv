2,methods2," FLIPAN Clinical Trial Guidelines  The adults who met the selection criteria were randomized following dietary interventions previously described for 6 months, characterized by an energy reduction of 25–30% of baseline calories intake and increase energy expenditure by 400 kcal/70 kg (5.7 kcal per kg of body weight) [24]. Trained dietitians provided patients a daily calorie prescription, food regimens based on exchange systems, and a seven-day meal for each season by trained dietitians.  Information about intakes was collected at baseline and 6 months, using a validated 148-items Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) [25]. The 148 items consist of usual portion sizes of foods and drinks with response categories to indicate frequency of consumption over a period of 12 months.",f7c9ea6a-5586-4326-98b8-3cd34369b6a5
3,methods3," Participants were asked how often, on average, they consumed the amount of item reported on the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) during the past year and responded using nine options ranging from never or less than once per month to six or more times per day. Additional foods not included in the questionnaire and the frequency of consumption were manually entered. Energy and nutrients intakes were calculated by multiplying the nutrient composition of the portion size of each item by the frequency of consumption using a computer program based on available food composition tables [26]. Dietary information derived from the 148-items Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) included total energy expressed as kcal per day (kcal/d), macro- and micro-nutrient intakes, and intakes according to food groups.  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD)) was assessed at baseline and 6 months by means of a validated 17-items questionnaire [27].",1fb520d7-46e4-4d68-a07f-4bc70fb7016b
4,methods4," A score was given for each met objective: 1 (compliance) or 0 (non-compliance). The total score ranged between 0 and 17, such as a score of 0 indicated no compliance and a score of 17 indicated maximum adherence.  The median value was calculated by subtracting the median value of Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) at 6 months from baseline, and subjects were distributed in “under median value (<50%)” (n = 31) and “above median value (≥50%)” (n = 36). Participants were classified into two groups according to the variation in the score obtained by a questionnaire to assess the adherence to Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) at the beginning and at the end of the intervention (baseline and 6-month follow-up).  2.3. Anthropometrics and Clinical Assessment  Weight (kg) was measured using a Segmental Body Composition Analyser for impedance testing (Tanita MC780P-MA, Tanita, Tokyo, Japan) with barefoot subjects and light clothes, subtracting 0.6 kg.",63770985-523c-464a-8d27-4826968ed527
5,methods5," body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters. Height was determined with an anthropometer (Seca 214, SECA Deutschland, Hamburg, Germany) to the closest millimeter. Blood pressure was measured with a semi-automatic oscillometer (Omron HEM, 705CP, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands) in the arm, registering the highest diastolic blood pressure, taking three measures, and waiting for 1 min between each determination. Intrahepatic fat contents (intrahepatic fat content (IFC)) were performed with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Signa Explorer 1.5T, General Electric Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) by using a 12-channel phased-array coil [28].

Plasma and PBMCs Isolation  Plasma samples were obtained by centrifuging whole fresh blood at 1700× g for 15 min at 4 °C. The Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) fraction was purified from fresh whole blood and isolated following the described protocol of Separation of White Blood Cells [30], using the reagent Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) [31].  2.6. Enzymatic Determinations  The antioxidant enzymes catalase (catalase (CAT)) and superoxide dismutase (superoxide dismutase (SOD)) were measured in plasma and PBMCs, using a Shimadzu UV-2100 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) at 37 °C.",ddf7d4e0-55ce-41e6-9b31-0d536837481d

After that, samples were estimated spectrophotometrically, using the procedure described above. Two calibration curves of standard GSH and glutathione (tGSH) and glutathione oxidized (GSSG) were set up under the same conditions. The tGSH/glutathione (tGSH) and glutathione oxidized (GSSG) ratio was calculated by dividing the concentrations of tGSH and glutathione (tGSH) and glutathione oxidized (GSSG).  2.8.",4194ee81-6ce4-404b-91bf-e2b484c01e17

For this purpose, total RNA was isolated from PBMCs by extraction with Tripure® (Tripure Isolation Reagent, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Then, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, 1 µg of RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed using TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents (Life Technologies®, Vall Allen Way Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 60 min at 42 °C and 5 min at 99 °C in a 10 µL final volume.",a12867d1-cda0-43cd-bc66-4d7b6472134e

Moreover, significant differences were observed in weight, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose, HbA1c, aminotransferase (AST), aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) when comparing the evolution after 6 months.",b4d84cb7-0eb5-4575-b5ee-69ad0199addc
14,methods14," The participants after the 6-month follow-up in the above median value group showed lower values in body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, aminotransferase (AST), and aminotransferase (ALT) than the baseline. The gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels in both groups after 6 months showed differences with the baseline. The glucose levels were lower in the group above the median value than those in the under median group after 6 months. No differences were evidenced in triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and c reactive protein (CRP).  Figure 1 showed the levels of intrahepatic fat content (IFC) according to the degree of improvement in adherence to the MedDiet. The intrahepatic fat content (IFC) levels decreased after the intervention period, but this decrease was only significant in the group with better improvement in the adherence to the MedDiet.",a05dcb61-6682-4fa4-b5fc-99e213e81855
15,methods15,"  Figure 2 showed the results of VO2max determined with the Chester step test, according to the degree of improvement in the adherence to the MedDiet. The obtained data reported a significant improvement after 6 months of the intervention with respect to the baseline in the group above the median value.  3.2. Hematological Parameters  Table 4 reports significant differences in the hematocrit, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils levels, whereas no differences were described in the other hematological variables. At the end of the intervention period, the hematocrit was higher in the group above the median than the group below, whereas the neutrophil and basophil counts were lower. The number of circulating eosinophils decreased after the intervention period only in the group with a higher adherence to the MedDiet.  3.3.

The enzymatic activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in PBMCs increased after 6-months intervention, but the differences were only significant in the group above the median value. TLR4, catalase (CAT), Mnsuperoxide dismutase (SOD), and Nrf2 relative mRNA expressions were assessed in PBMCs. The mRNA levels of TLR4 showed a significant decrease after the 6-month intervention in the group above the median value.

18,methods18," Strengths and Limitations  There is limited scientific evidence on the effect of adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the intrahepatic fat contents (intrahepatic fat content (IFC)), and levels of oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers after a 6-month lifestyle intervention in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients; then, the first strength of the present study is that it contributes to increasing knowledge about it. The longitudinal design provides more evidence than cross-sectional designs. The standardized protocol followed reduces the risk of information bias. On top of the strengths, our findings could be easily implemented into clinical practice. This strength is very important because there is no existing alternative treatment for non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) yet [6,7]. Nonetheless, the present study has some limitations. Firstly, the main limitation would be the small sample size.",69a775a7-d4b2-4e52-bec2-81e975a0b4ec
19,methods19," A bigger sample size could give a more confident answer to which intervention was the best. Secondly, people in the FLIPAN trial were between 40–60 years old, and this is a limitation when it comes to extrapolating results to all of the population. Thirdly, there is a selection bias in baseline patients; this fact is because, at the beginning of this study, the groups are classified according to their diet group. Then, no signs were shown with this classification, and for this reason, it has been decided to classify according to the adherence to the MedDiet, and with this selection, homogeneity is lost a bit. Lastly, although the diagnosis was made by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), having been able to do biopsies could have more accurately assessed the evolution of steatosis.  4.2.",76387f0c-5ef4-4dfd-b19c-174d904ee06c
20,methods20," Anthropometric and Biochemical Parameters  The main findings of this study are that higher increases in the adherence to the MedDiet after the 6-month nutritional intervention are clearly related to a better oxidative stress and inflammatory state in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may be useful to treat this disease. Patients with a higher adherence also showed better evolution in the pathology with lower intrahepatic fat content (IFC) and circulating levels of CK-18. Previous studies showed that a higher adherence to the MedDiet was associated with reduced non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence and insulin resistance and with lower severe liver disease among patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [34,35].  Present results are in accordance with previous studies that evidenced a bodyweight loss and reduced changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after increasing the adherence to the MedDiet [36,37].",6629422f-4a10-4f05-b681-ac3cddb38b43
21,methods21," Like these results, it was reported that a low adherence to the MedDiet was associated with high blood glucose and HbA1c levels in diabetic patients [38,39]. These results confirm the fact that the MedDiet contributes to an improvement in glycemic control and insulin sensitivity and a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events. aminotransferase (AST), aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) are widely used as markers of liver injury and may be useful measures for monitoring non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [40]. The better evolution in these enzymes in the group with a higher adherence to the MedDiet agrees with previous findings that evidenced a significant improvement between the baseline and end-treatment in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) after MedDiet follow-up, reducing the risk and severity of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as well as the levels of circulating liver enzymes [7,41].",2667a3fa-f1f4-4752-8cc2-ef6f6e7aada2
22,methods22," Moreover, the plasma levels of CK-18, an intracellular protein associated with necrosis and apoptosis of hepatocytes [42], decreased mainly in the group with better improvement in the MedDiet. A previous study observed an association between high levels of CK-18 and hypertension in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients; therefore, CK-18 could be helpful to detect early hypertension [43]. These results highlight the beneficial effects of the MedDiet by observing a decrease in plasma liver damage markers in the group that has most improved their adherence to the MedDiet.  Adherence to the MedDiet is associated with better antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic status due to the increased consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-3, and antioxidant compounds [44,45]. In fact, a meta-analysis has shown that omega-3 fatty acids were negatively associated with hepatic steatosis [46].",745f9253-c28b-4f71-bb35-f374b09cc545
23,methods23," Moreover, it was demonstrated that an antioxidant-enriched MedDiet contributes to the restoration of normal lipid metabolism, which could prevent non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development and progression [47]. In the present study, the beneficial effects of the nutritional intervention were evidenced by a significant reduction in intrahepatic fat content (IFC) after 6 months of consuming the MedDiet. Similarly, an inverse association between the ADM and liver damage was observed in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients due to a reduction in intrahepatic lipids detected with magnetic resonance [48]. These patients who most improved their diet quality also significantly increased their physical capacity as assessed by the Chester step test.",fb3703c3-30ed-415c-a64e-286a7a9dddda
24,methods24," These results suggest the existence of an association between diet quality and physical exercise practice, contributing more efficiently to improve the non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), agreeing with previously published results [49]. These results support the conclusions of a previous meta-analysis that a high adherence to the MedDiet was associated with better physical performance and global cognitive function [50].  4.3. Hematological Parameters  Regarding hematological parameters, lower levels of neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils were observed in the group above the median after a 6-month follow-up, while platelets, although they tend to decrease, did not present statistical differences. These immune cell types are granulocytes responsible for innate immunity and are also considered markers of inflammation.",4f538380-cab1-4c38-88c8-4a7450a30294
25,methods25," The decrease in their number in the group with a higher adherence may be related to better biochemical parameters and lower fat accumulation that would reduce the proinflammatory state of patients and the mobilization of immune cells. It is in accordance with previous evidence of a significant reduction in leukocyte number after 12 weeks of nutritional intervention with the MedDiet and extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) [51]. A significant reduction was also observed in leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes after sustained weight loss at 2 years [52]. Moreover, in healthy subjects, an inverse relation between the adherence to the MedDiet and the food antioxidant content with white blood cell counts and platelets was observed [53].  4.4.",63241ad1-5cbb-47b4-87e8-a4796ea818aa
26,methods26," Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory Biomarkers  In the present study, the patients with the best increase in their adherence to the MedDiet presented with enhanced antioxidant in plasma and PBMCs and better redox status after the intervention period. The beneficial effects of the MedDiet are attributed, among other factors, to the presence of bioactive compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [54,55]. In fact, a nutritional intervention based on the MedDiet pattern increased the total antioxidant capacity (total antioxidant capacity (TAC)) of serum compared to the control group assigned to a low-fat diet [56]. In addition to this direct action, some components of the MedDiet can induce endogenous antioxidant in metabolic syndrome patients [57,58]. Although the expression of CuZnsuperoxide dismutase (SOD), Mnsuperoxide dismutase (SOD), and Nrf2 also tended to increase its variation, it was not significant.",85eaea56-d289-402e-a5dd-a8277eddca34
27,methods27," This lack of differences could derive from the variability between individuals; thus, increasing the number of participants could have shown clearer differences. However, the expression of the glutathione peroxidase (GPX) as downstream genes induced by Nrf2 increased significantly in the higher adherence group [59]. In addition, the high levels of GSH after 6 months of intervention could also derive from the activation of Nrf2 because genes responsible for the synthesis of GSH are also induced by Nrf2.  Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is released by neutrophils and monocytes in inflammatory conditions, enhancing this inflammatory process and inducing oxidative stress. High levels of Myeloperoxidase (MPO) were observed in obese subjects, mainly if they simultaneously presented higher values of hs-c reactive protein (CRP) with respect to normal-weight subjects [60].",a306761e-7550-409e-93eb-8239244b4b1e
28,methods28," Moreover, high Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was also reported in liver biopsies from patients with fatty liver simple steatosis, progressively increasing from non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to NASH [61]. In the present study, the greater reduction observed in the group with a better adherence after a 6-month nutritional intervention may be due to a better inflammatory profile that decreases both the number of circulating immune cells and their pre-activation state.  Resolvin D1 is a pro-revolving mediator of inflammation derived from docosahexaenoic acid, which can contribute to the improvement of obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions, reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress [62]. Previously, it was demonstrated that resolvin D1 levels were lower in patients with a higher intrahepatic fat content (IFC) than in subjects with lower fat accumulation [63].",3701dd3f-ffda-42cd-bb02-d54410ca03ab
29,methods29," The results of this study revealed that participants from both groups, after a 6-month follow-up, showed higher levels of resolvin D1 than the baseline values, indicating that even small improvements in the adherence to the MedDiet have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects. In accordance with the present results, it was evidenced that stimulated neutrophils from patients with metabolic syndrome increased the release of resolvins after the weight loss program [64].  On the contrary, the levels of TNFα and IL-6 as proinflammatory markers show a tendency to decrease, although it is only significant for IL-6 in the group with the highest adherence. Previous data reported an association between these inflammatory biomarkers with impairment of oxidative status due to non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and fat accumulation [65,66]. This decrease in inflammatory cytokines agrees with the decrease in TLR4 expression.",c398af4b-583b-40f9-a76a-d7e49612e541
30,methods30," Activation of TLRs induces a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways leading to proinflammatory cytokine production and can also contribute to insulin resistance [67]. TLR4 can be activated by saturated fatty acids and ceramides which could be relevant in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [68]. In fact, the expression of TLR4 is higher in the liver of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients than in healthy patients [69]. Weight loss, together with a better metabolic profile, can reduce the proinflammatory state and the presence of free fatty acids, reducing the expression of TLR4 and its downstream products.  Irisin is a cytokine mainly induced by exercise involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis. An increment of irisin levels in circulation was associated with a more aggressive phenotype of liver disease [70].",29b9dd8d-72a5-4c64-b98b-352543e25fa9
31,methods31," However, and although a tendency to decrease its levels has been observed after 6 months of follow-up with respect to the initial values, the differences were not significant.  5. Conclusions  non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disorder that is related to excessive accumulation of fats in the liver with increasing prevalence and no effective pharmacological treatment. The present study showed that an improvement in the dietary quality, evaluated by the adherence to the MedDiet, can improve the anthropometric and biochemical parameters, as well as the intrahepatic fat content (IFC) and the physical capacity of the patients, which agrees with previous published results [49]. A better adherence to the MedDiet also improved the oxidative and proinflammatory status in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) after a 6-month lifestyle intervention.",29eefe9b-6243-4109-817d-8edc6873b96f
32,methods32," Although the subjects followed similar recommendations, the results obtained highlighted that a greater adherence to the marked guidelines allows them to have a better evolution of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). ",61141699-a1f9-487c-bbb5-0a5036e78201
