0,methods0," 2.1. Population  The study population was part of the Three-City (3C) cohort, a prospective population-based study started in 1999 in France with 9294 inhabitants of 3 municipalities (Bordeaux, Dijon, and Montpellier). The initial objective of this study was to examine the association between vascular risk factors and dementia. Recruitment was performed by random selection from the electoral rolls, and to be included, the participants had to live at home in one of the three cities or their suburbs and to be aged 65+. Participants were followed up every two to three years until 2018 (up to 7 waves). The Advisory Committee for the Protection of Persons Participating in Biomedical Research of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Kremlin-Bicêtre approved the study protocol and each participant in the study signed a free and informed consent form [23]. The entire protocol of the 3C cohort is described elsewhere [14].  2.2.",bda96065-cb38-46b2-bcc2-d9d10b731f91
1,methods1," Study Sample  The study sample was restricted to the 3C Bordeaux cohort, where detailed nutritional data were collected in 2001–2002, considered as the baseline of the present analysis. The participants included in the present study were free of DS at the time of the dietary survey (baseline for the present study) and 2 years earlier (3C recruitment), as ascertained by their drug consumption and by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale (detailed further). Finally, included participants were not demented at the time of 3C inclusion.  2.3. Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet  The dietary survey included a 24 h dietary recall and a food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) administered at home by dieticians. Adherence to the MeDi was assessed once from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which recorded 148 foods and beverages, and the use of the MeDi-Lite score proposed by Sofi et al. [24].",f5752176-a762-48ff-b7f3-20f7b7b60c33
2,methods2," As previously described, this score was computed using the frequency of consumption of 9 food groups characterizing the traditional MeDi [25]. Higher consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish and olive oil, moderate consumption of dairy products and alcohol, and low consumption of meat were considered beneficial. Sofi et al. determined the thresholds used for the attribution of points based on the frequency of consumption of each food group from those reported in the literature for the computation of the MeDi-Lite score (Supplementary Materials, Table S1) [24]. Then, in the present study, the score was divided into tertiles to define three degrees of adherence to the MeDi: “low”, “moderate”, and “high”.  2.4. Depressive Symptomatology  DS was assessed at each wave by a neuropsychologist during a face-to-face interview, using the CES-D scale, a validated 20-item scale [26,27].",08620d58-28fc-482b-b2de-740c19563b83
3,methods3," The total CES-D score ranged from 0 to 60 according to the frequency (from “never” to “always,” rated from 0 to 3) of the depressive symptoms felt during the previous week. Scores of 16 or greater confirmed DS, as well as missing data due to severe depression, as ascertained by the neuropsychologist in charge of the survey. Any use of antidepressant treatment was recorded and its pharmacology class was identified according to the World Health Organization’s Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical corresponding classification “N06A” [28]. Thus, at each follow-up wave, DS was defined combining the CES-D score (i.e., ≥16) and/or the use of antidepressant treatment: this definition combined participants (i) with high CES-D score without recourse to medication, OR (ii) with low CES-D score and antidepressant use being efficient (therapeutic success), and OR (iii) participants with high CES-D score and antidepressant use later being inefficient (antidepressant nonresponders).  2.5.",1120f8da-4a1a-43be-8212-0013249d4df0
4,methods4," Covariates  From the dataset, we retained the following data for the description of the studied sample: sex, age, living conditions (living alone, in couple and cohabitation), educational level (no study or elementary, secondary, high school and university), monthly income (<EUR1500, 1500–2250, ≥2250, and refused to answer), tobacco consumption (number of pack-years), body mass index (BMI; measured and expressed as <25, 25–30 and ≥30 kg/m2), practice of regular physical activity (yes or no), total energy intake (in kcal/day) and Mini Mental State Examination (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) score. Multimorbidity (yes or no) was summarized as ≥2 health disorders among hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, angina, cardiac rhythm disorders, arteritis, cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for stroke, asthma, Parkinson’s disease, dyspnea, osteoporosis, dementia, and cancer [29].",5f1d4d03-5b09-4692-8379-4c09ece99dfe
5,methods5," All these health disorders were self-reported at baseline of the present study, except for dementia, which was clinically diagnosed. Among these covariates, the most relevant potential confounders were identified from information found in the literature and with a directed acyclic graph (directed acyclic graph (DAG)).  2.6. Statistical Analysis  All statistical analyses were achieved using RStudio Software (Allaire J.J., South Bend, USA, version 1.3.1093) and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. We firstly described and compared the characteristics of the included participants according to the degree of adherence to the MeDi from MeDi-Lite score using chi-squared tests for qualitative variables and analysis of variance for quantitative variables (nonparametric ones for those with asymmetric distribution). The weekly food group consumption used to define the MeDi-Lite score was also described according to the degree of adherence to the MeDi.  2.7.",e94e82db-2944-4ad6-9264-1b233605b62c
6,methods6," Association between MeDi Adherence and Risk of DS  Random-effect logistic regression was performed to examine the association between MeDi adherence (the reference category was chosen as the lowest adherence tertile) and the risk of DS over time adjusted for the baseline value of all retained potential confounders: age (time scale in the model), sex, educational level, living conditions, physical activity, tobacco consumption, BMI, total energy intake, and multimorbidity. Each model included time, MeDi adherence and all the selected covariates. The interaction between MeDi adherence and time was not significant and therefore not introduced in the model. The group probabilities of DS (in logit scale) vary thus in parallel through time and the estimated odds ratios correspond to the constant differences through time between the MeDi groups. The random-effect logistic model uses all observed data to estimate the model parameters, and thus was appropriate for the longitudinal data.",0ee88f19-1411-498e-b682-655043c0673e
7,methods7," Indeed, this method takes into account all individuals, even if they are followed up only once over time, in order not to lose information. In this analysis, DS was the binary response (yes/no) and two types of random effects were introduced into the model: a random intercept, assuming heterogeneity between individuals at the first evaluation, and a random slope, assuming variability over time. In order to estimate the risk of developing DS as a function of age, the function of time corresponded to the time elapsed since the age of 65 years (inclusion criteria in the 3C cohort).  2.8. Additional Analyses  2.8.1. CES-D Score ≥ 16  First, considering that antidepressant treatment may be prescribed for other indications, the DS was also defined only as having a CES-D score ≥ 16, irrespective of antidepressant use.  2.8.2. Sex-Specific Cutoffs for Identifying DS  Subsequently, DS was defined using validated sex-specific French cutoffs (i.e.",5ad864c8-77da-4eb8-8ce0-cfe28a53e9db
8,methods8,", CES-D score ≥ 17 for men and ≥23 for women) and/or antidepressant treatment use [30].  2.8.3. Mediterranean Diet Adherence Assessed by Two Alternative Scores  Adherence to the MeDi was also estimated using two other approaches: the Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) proposed by Trichopoulou et al. [31] (ranged from 0 to 9) and the MedDietScore proposed by Panagiotakos et al. [32] (ranged from 0 to 55). The computation of these scores has been detailed in Supplementary Materials (Tables S2 and S3).  2.9. Missing Data  Some covariates had missing data: to keep the maximum of information, we ran a multiple imputation by chained equations using the mice packages [33], an elaborate strategy limiting the bias introduced by the missing data under certain conditions (assumption of missing at random data) [34]. Each variable is associated with an imputation model conditionally to other selected variables of the dataset.",83f1cc3c-88c9-48ac-bc38-3cbc77d96df2
9,methods9," Ten imputed datasets were generated and we combined the results from analyses on each of them to obtain the summary fixed effects. Among selected potential confounders, tobacco consumption had 14 missing values (1.4%), BMI had 10 missing values (1.0%), total energy intake had 3 missing values (0.3%) and regular physical activity had 152 missing values (14.9%).  3. Results  3.1. Sample Selection  The 3C Bordeaux cohort was composed of 1755 individuals at baseline of the present analysis (first year of follow-up in 3C). We excluded participants with: (i) prevalent DS at study baseline (n = 153) or 2-year earlier at inclusion in the 3C cohort (n = 358), (ii) missing data for DS at baseline (n = 30) or with no follow-up visit (n = 105), (iii) missing data on MeDi adherence (n = 85), and (iv) demented at 3C inclusion (n = 6), leading to a study sample of 1018 individuals (Figure 1). The median follow-up time was 11.5 years (minimum 1.6 and maximum 16.3 years).",5743c77a-2d69-49a0-8318-d92b0c8daad1
10,methods10," Individuals had on average 4 follow-up visits and 372 participants were present at the last visit, while 522 died during the follow-up.  3.2. Descriptive Characteristics of the Study Sample  The study sample included 57.2% women with a mean age of 75.6 years (standard deviation (SD): 4.8 years) at baseline (Table 1). More than half the participants (58.9%) lived as a couple. Thirty-two percent of the studied sample were highly educated (university level) and 30.6% declared a monthly income of EUR2250 or more. Participants had smoked on average 9.5 (SD: 18.1) pack-years, 45.9% had a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m2 and more than half of them (53.7%) were not physically active. The participants consumed on average 1741 kcal/day (SD: 540) and had an Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 27.8 points on average. More than half the participants (54.0%) were concerned by multimorbidity and the mean CES-D score was 4.9 (± 4.0) at baseline.  3.3.",c55e8fb4-b830-432a-a1ed-17cda4451c82
11,methods11," Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet  MeDi-Lite score was 10 on average (minimum 4 and maximum 16) and the lowest adherents (n = 257, 25.3%) had a score lower than or equal to 9, those with moderate adherence (n = 389, 38.2%) between 10 and 11, and the highest adherents (n = 372, 36.5%) equal to or greater than 12. Women were less often low MeDi-Lite adherents than men. At baseline, individuals with the lowest MeDi-Lite score smoked more and were less often concerned by multimorbidity than the other adherents were. Regardless of the degree of adherence to the MeDi, participants exhibited on average similar ages, living conditions, educational levels, monthly incomes, BMI, physical activity, total energy intake, cognitive performances on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and CES-D scores at baseline (Table 1).",ca2b4764-880c-4da9-8d0e-0141dd75ceb7
12,methods12,"  The description of weekly food group consumption according to the MeDi-Lite score categories showed that the highest adherents had a significantly higher consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, and fish, more regular use of olive oil, and lower consumption of meat and dairy products, as expected by the score computation, and they had lower alcohol consumption (Table 2).  3.4. Incidence of DS over Time  A total of 400 incident cases of DS (39.3%) were identified during the 15-year follow-up. Among them, 218 participants (54.5%) exhibited a CES-D score ≥ 16 at least once over time, 103 participants (25.7%) had antidepressant treatment prescribed at least once over time and 79 participants (19.8%) had both CES-D score ≥ 16 and antidepressant treatment prescribed at least once over time.  3.5.",9328f24c-0ec7-45d3-9309-ca50b1957e60
13,methods13," Association between MeDi Adherence and Risk of DS  Greater MeDi adherence, assessed by the MeDi-Lite score, was not significantly associated with reduced odds of DS over time after controlling for age (time scale in the model), sex, educational level, living conditions, physical activity, tobacco consumption, BMI, total energy intake and multimorbidity (odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.52;1.30] and OR = 0.72, 95% CI [0.45;1.16] for the moderate and for the highest MeDi adherents, respectively, compared with the lowest MeDi adherents, p-value for trend = 0.404) (Table 3). However, we observed that being a woman, living in a couple or in cohabitation (vs alone), being older and concerned by multimorbidity were significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of DS in the multivariate analysis (OR = 1.94, 95% CI [1.22; 3.08], p-value = 0.005 for women vs. men; OR = 1.71, 95% CI [1.14; 2.56] and OR = 2.23, 95% CI [1.02; 4.",1a9ed52f-3123-4873-ad8e-d9699ecce064
14,methods14,"88], for living in couple and in cohabitation, respectively, vs. alone, p-value for trend = 0.017 and OR = 1.79, 95% CI [1.24; 2.58], p-value = 0.002 for individual concerned by multimorbidity vs. not).  3.6. Additional Analyses  3.6.1. CES-D Score ≥ 16  When considering the definition of DS restricted on the CES-D scores (i.e., ≥16), 297 participants (29.2%) developed a DS during the follow-up. Using this definition of DS, there was a trend towards a greater adherence to the MeDi being associated with reduced odds of DS, but the association was borderline significant (OR = 0.72, 05% CI [0.46; 1.11] and OR = 0.57, 95% CI [0.36; 0.90], respectively, for moderate and high adherents compared with low adherents; p-value for trend = 0.053) (Table 4).  3.6.2. Sex-Specific Cutoffs for Identifying DS  Using the French sex-specific cutoffs (i.e., CES-D score ≥ 17 for men and ≥ 23 for women) and/or antidepressant use for defining DS, we identified 321 incident cases (31.5%) during follow-up.",016c2837-4048-4522-b249-9d215df9eb3b
15,methods15," The association between adherence to the MeDi and the incidence of DS with sex-specific cutoffs was not statistically significant after controlling for all selected confounders (OR = 0.95, 95% CI [0.48; 1.88] and OR = 0.76, 95% CI [0.38; 1.53] for moderate and high adherents, respectively, compared with low adherents; p-value for trend = 0.678) (Supplementary Materials, Table S4).  3.6.3. Mediterranean Diet Adherence Assessed with Two Alternative Scores  Then, we used two alternative scores to assess MeDi adherence: the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the MedDietScore. The association between the adherence to the MeDi according to the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) or the MedDietScore and the incidence of DS (defined as CES-D ≥ 16 and/or antidepressant treatment use) was not statistically significant after adjustment for all confounders (p-value for trend = 0.301 and 0.560, respectively) (Table 5).  4.",d85869f7-c530-4f3e-a57f-9c233e505f93
16,methods16," Discussion  In this large prospective sample of older French adults followed for up to 15 years, no significant association was observed between MeDi adherence and the risk of DS using different approaches to assess MeDi adherence. However, when DS was restricted to individuals with a CES-D score ≥ 16 irrespective of medication use, a trend was observed for an inverse association between a greater adherence to the MeDi and the odds of DS. Thus, a healthy diet such as the MeDi might be a promising approach, although probably not sufficient alone for older adults.  Overall, previous studies focusing on the relationship between MeDi adherence and risk for depression in the general adult population have reported inconsistent results, as summarized in two recent meta-analyses (seven joint studies).",393c28cf-0a2c-48cf-82c5-1049d4a2c78e
17,methods17," In the first meta-analysis [10], the combined seven prospective cohorts (of more than 50,000 adults from France, the USA, Australia, and Spain) reported a lack of association between MeDi adherence assessed by the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) or the MedDietScore and the risk of DS assessed by different depression scales, medical diagnosis or use of antidepressant treatment. In the second meta-analysis [18], when restricting results to the combination of the four retained longitudinal studies (all already included in the previous described meta-analysis), the highest adherence to the MeDi (assessed with Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) or rMediterranean Diet Score (MDS), which differed only by fat component) was associated with a significant 33% reduced odds of DS compared to the lowest adherence (overall OR = 0.67, 95% CI [0.55; 0.82]). Of note, only two studies included in this meta-analysis were implemented near the Mediterranean Basin and none was focused on older adults.",6c66bce5-7d9c-4a9e-85ab-85c4dc45b07f
18,methods18," A single French study, focusing on adults involved in the SU.VI.MAX randomized trial, reported no association between MeDi adherence (assessed with the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) and the risk of DS [35]. In the second study, from the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra/University of Navarra Follow up (SUN) cohort on Spanish students, DS was assessed using self-reported diagnosis and antidepressant treatment. High adherence to the MeDi (also assessed with the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) was associated with a significantly reduced risk of DS compared to the lowest adherence with a significant dose–response relationship [36]. While these European studies were close to the present ones regarding location and therefore with consumption close to a South European lifestyle, results were not strictly comparable because of the heterogeneity regarding the age of participants involved.",7896a8f9-c88f-41c7-8f3a-6957d721df10
19,methods19," Altogether, these results, implemented near the Mediterranean area, suggest a promising protective relationship between higher MeDi adherence and the risk of DS without confirming it at older ages. Finally, MeDi adherence is also part of a healthier lifestyle in general, especially in countries far from the Mediterranean Basin, which can favorably affect mental health and mood.  Inconsistent results observed worldwide could be explained in part by the difficulty in identifying DS among the community of the oldest old. Indeed, the increase in age and in age-related health disorders could be accompanied by subtle changes in mood, while unnoticed or considered classical traits of aging, and on the other hand, depressive disorders could be expressed as atypical form in older adults (i.e., aggressive or addictive behaviors, anxiety and personality disorders), leading to potential misclassification bias [37,38].",d84703d9-f3ce-4983-9967-8921e3c364b5
20,methods20," Moreover, depression is multidimensional and involves many individual and societal factors, especially in older people (i.e., social isolation, life event, health issues, economic changes…) against which the adoption of a healthy diet as a single preventive dimension seems insufficient to guarantee a better mood [39]. Indeed, the MeDi would be inefficient at older ages (mean age of the present study sample was 75.6 years, with a follow-up of up to 16.3 years) or may be less effective in older adults than antidepressant treatment to postpone depression/prevent the development of depressive symptoms in a complex context, including polypathology during aging and/or environmentally deleterious conditions accompanying aging (widowhood for instance).",6ad04ae8-3ecf-4295-bf78-28a4dcd57801
21,methods21," Interestingly, while fruit and vegetables, as food sources of antioxidants [40,41], and fish, as a source of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, are part of MeDi components that would reduce the risk of depression [42], other interesting foods or nutrients not part of the MeDi would potentially contribute to beneficial or deleterious associations with the risk of DS. For instance, the consumption of coffee or tea are notably rich providers of polyphenols, with potential neuroprotection due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [41]. On the other hand, sweetened beverages, salt, or other fats than olive oil, involved in increased inflammation and oxidative stress, would contribute to the pathogenesis of depression [43,44,45].",238b6101-c413-4d12-9ab8-9efb4cbc11d4
22,methods22," Another mechanism involved in this relationship concerns an essential amino acid, tryptophan, supplied by a variety of foods (including peanuts, oats and bananas), which represent a good avenue against depression due to its conversion in serotonin, the target of a majority of antidepressant treatments [44]. Finally, the diet–depression relationship is underpinned by numerous correlated mechanisms including neurogenesis, epigenetic, hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis, and mitochondrial dysfunction in addition to aging, while we cannot ascertain them [44].  Regarding the present study, it is important to point out some limits. In the 3C cohort, the dietary survey was administered only in the 3C Bordeaux subsample, which may induce a selection bias, though reduced by the representativeness of the 3C Bordeaux sample during the follow-up [46].",109f0643-540f-4137-b0a0-c8857b75f938
23,methods23," We assumed the stability of food behaviors over time, which is acceptable for the whole group [47], but we cannot totally exclude a change in dietary habits of a specific individual over time (for clinical reasons, change in living conditions, diseases requiring a specific diet…), although we cannot ascertain specifically these changes. Moreover, the computation of scores to assess adherence to the MeDi caused several dietary patterns to coexist in a single category of MeDi adherents, as already pointed out [48]. Regarding DS, the CES-D scale is not a clinical diagnostic tool, though validated and largely used in epidemiological studies [10,18,19,20]. The inclusion of antidepressant treatment in the definition of the outcome is also debatable, since it leads to a heterogeneous group of participants with incident DS efficiently treated or not and because these treatments being not only prescribed for depression [49].",e08c7f97-54cf-49d6-bf0f-986f66da491a
24,methods24," This led us to test the robustness of our results in an additional analysis not including antidepressant treatment in the definition of DS, which potentially minimized the misclassification bias. Moreover, alcohol consumption is linked to depression and could have been considered as a main confounder as in other studies, but as one of nine food groups are part of the MeDi, it could have led to an overadjustment and we chose to not include it in the present study. A final point concerns the potential reverse-causality bias, in part limited thanks to the long follow-up of the present analysis and by the exclusion of participants with DS at baseline and at the previous examination. However, we cannot exclude that greater MeDi adherents at baseline, who reported higher multimorbidity than low MeDi adherents, have been engaged in this healthy dietary lifestyle as an additional management of their diseases.",ed3f7b67-58b2-472e-86be-1e0c33a3c612
25,methods25," Despite these limitations, it is also relevant to highlight all the strengths of the present study. The large sample of more than 1000 older adults, the long duration of 15 years, the interviews using standardized questionnaires using validated tools (CES-D and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) performed by trained professionals, and the consideration of main confounders (although residual confounders may persist in observational studies) are the main strengths of the present analysis. In addition, the innovative statistical approach allowed us to use all information from repeated measures and consider potential changesin depression over time.  5. Conclusions  No association was observed between MeDi adherence and the risk of DS in a French population-based sample aged 65 years and over, followed for up to 15 years.",2afd340a-f1fe-4f86-8e62-f86c4a34285d
26,methods26," However, a trend suggesting a potential benefit of a greater adherence to the MeDi on the basis of reduced odds of DS when restricting the definition of DS to the CES-D scores has been observed. This study adds to the available literature, specifically on older people, and suggests that adopting healthy dietary patterns appears insufficient to maintain satisfying mental health in older adults. Future studies are warranted to explore this complex relation and to better understand the underlying mechanisms. ",6a53d159-7ba4-4720-b229-408bda81bb0b
