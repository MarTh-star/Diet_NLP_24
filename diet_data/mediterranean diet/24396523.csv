0,introduction0,"Osteoporosis, defined as “a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture” [1], is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. This is why, with an ageing population throughout much of the world, improving prevention of such a disease will play a major role in the sustainability and implementation of good personal and public health care. In this light, there is a growing interest among the medical scientists in the search of new strategies, including dietary approaches. Although calcium and vitamin D have been the primary focus of nutritional prevention, analysis of ongoing challenges has highlighted that the human diet contains, in addition to essential macronutrients, a complex array of naturally occurring bioactive micronutrients that may confer significant long term health benefits, including in the management of bone health.",1e27372f-7c6c-4021-951b-d1e5c804d38a
1,introduction1," This issue probably explains the north-south gradient of fractures in Europe, with a lower incidence in the Mediterranean area [2]–[4]. Indeed, Perez-Lopez et al. [5] have highlighted the benefits for bone of the Mediterranean diet (characterized by a high consumption of plant foods, low to moderate intakes of fish, poultry, dairy products and wine, a low amount of red meat, olive oil being the major source of fat, [6]) such a dietary pattern being thought to be related to the longevity of Mediterranean people. In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition study, increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet appears to protect against hip fracture occurrence [7]. In the same way, varied diets based on Mediterranean diet patterns have been reported to be positively associated with bone mineral density (bone mineral density (BMD)) in both pre- and post-menopausal healthy Spanish women [8]. In a holistic dietary approach, Kontogianni et al.",0894ce67-1486-46e7-9b6b-0e9e4e72cac5
2,introduction2," [9] have shown that adherence to a dietary pattern close to the Mediterranean diet, i.e., high consumption of fish and olive oil and low red meat intake, was positively related to bone mass, suggesting potential bone-preserving properties of this pattern throughout adult life. It is important to know that more than 200 chemical compounds are found in olive oil, including phenols (20–500 mg/L), sterols, squalene and tocopherols [10]–[12], in addition to oleic acid (C18∶1) (55–83%), palmitic acid (C16∶0) (7.5–20%) and linoleic acid (C18∶2) (3.5–21%), as stated in the Codex Alimentarius [13]. Even though olive oil composition varies according to the cultivation area, the cultivar, the harvesting and storage systems, the ripening degree of the fruits, and the processing practices [10], [14], [15], scientists have reported that both olives [16] and olive oil [17], [18] can prevent bone loss in ovariectomized rats or mice [19].",df7f6ff3-e7ca-44d6-abb0-a77f2d5164db
3,introduction3," Among olive polyphenols, oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol may have critical effects on the maintenance of bone health [17], [20]–[22]. Besides, with regards to fish consumption, it can be a major source of vitamin D (in addition to a specific content in fatty acids). Vitamin D deficiency is actually very common worldwide [23]–[25] and it is associated with a 77% increased risk of fracture in women with post-menopausal osteoporosis [26]. The pooled analysis published by Bischoff-Ferrari and coworkers concluded that high-dose vitamin D supplementation (≥800 IU daily) was somewhat favorable in the prevention of hip fracture and any non-vertebral fracture in persons 65 years of age or older [27].  As vitamin D is lipophilic, supplementation of a lipid matrix such as olive oil is feasible and might be of public interest in the management of bone health.",70c8eaed-d8a7-4ba9-bd90-b64365d7809f
4,introduction4," This is why we investigated the effect of the consumption of olive oil enriched or not with vitamin D, in the ovariectomized mice as a model of post-menopausal osteoporosis. Moreover, because the bone sparing effect of the polyphenols from olive oil has already been highlighted, possible synergy between those micronutrients and vitamin D was studied and compared to the impact of a refined olive oil (depleted in polyphenols) fortified with vitamin D or not.  Materials & Methods Animals All the experimental procedures were approved by the institution’s animal welfare committee (Comité d’Ethique en Matière d’Expérimentation Animale Auvergne: CEMEAA) and were conducted in accordance with the European’s guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (2010- 63UE).

In the case of the virgin oil, fortification with vitamin D was associated to a correction of the expression of Esr1 gene (similar values in both VO-SH and VO-ovariectomized (OVX)-VD3, while the expression was higher in VO-ovariectomized (OVX) than in VO-SH) (Fig. 3).",6bdba2d0-8f45-42c0-bb5b-ae59adb511e4
28,results18," Alkaline phosphatase (Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)), Lrp5 and sclerostin (Sost1) signals were significantly reduced and there was a tendency for a reduction of osterix expression in the VO-ovariectomized (OVX)-VD3 vs the RO-ovariectomized (OVX)-VD3 group (p = 0.058; analysis was performed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the ovariectomized (OVX) groups). Actually, consistently with the bone mineral density (BMD) data, the major effect targeted osteoclast genes, i.e. resorption. Indeed, the expression of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), Ctsk, Itg-β3 and Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) (Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF kappaB) (RANK)) was down regulated by virgin olive oil and vitamin D (p = 0.0004; p = 0.001; p = 0.002; p = 0.003 respectively; analysis was performed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the ovariectomized (OVX) groups), compared to what was observed in RO-ovariectomized (OVX)-VD3 mice (Fig. 4).",ad3ae753-d97a-4656-8163-c249274cec67
29,results19," The decreased expression of Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF kappaB) (RANK) was associated with a similar Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF kappaB) (RANK) ligand (Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF kappaB) (RANK) ligand (Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF kappaB) (RANK)L)) to osteoprotegerin (osteoprotegerin (OPG)) ratio. Interestingly, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP, thrombospondin 5) was significantly down regulated in VO-ovariectomized (OVX)-VD3 as compared to VO-ovariectomized (OVX), but not statistically different from the level in VO-SH animals, elevated COMP levels in serum being found to be predictive of developing joint destruction in osteoarthritis (RO-SH: 1.00±0.10; RO-ovariectomized (OVX): 1.32±0.15; RO-ovariectomized (OVX)-VD3∶1.42±0.10; VO-SH: 1.06±0.09; VO-ovariectomized (OVX): 1.26±0.07; VO-ovariectomized (OVX)-VD3∶0.79±0.09; p = 0.",7faa46f4-52c4-4a86-b7a1-5b1643874b9a
30,results20,"0003; analysis was performed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the 6 groups). Finally, PPAR expression, a marker for adipogenesis, was not significantly different between the experimental groups (RO-SH: 1.00±0.09; RO-ovariectomized (OVX): 1.57±0.13; RO-ovariectomized (OVX)-VD3∶1.50±0.12; VO-SH: 1.29±0.12; VO-ovariectomized (OVX): 1.34±0.10; VO-ovariectomized (OVX)-VD3∶1.26±0.15; p = 0.061; analysis was performed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the 6 groups). Moreover, genes involved in inflammation such as IL-1β, IL-6 were significantly decreased in VO-ovariectomized (OVX)-VD3, compared to the level in VO-SH group (Fig. 5). Compared to the refined oil ovariectomized (OVX) groups, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCl2), Toll like receptors 2 (Tlr2) and Tlr4 were down regulated in the VO-ovariectomized (OVX)-VD3 mice (p = 0.001; p<0.0001; p = 0.001 respectively; analysis was performed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the ovariectomized (OVX) groups).",ba99e049-c8f2-4c93-ab2e-f1b2888fd430
31,results21," Finally, Nos2 expression (a marker of oxidative stress) in this test group was not different from that in VO-SH rodents, but significantly lower than in VO-ovariectomized (OVX) (p<0.0001; analysis was performed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the 6 groups) (Fig. 5).

32,discussion0,"Broad-based preventive strategies designed to lower the risk of osteoporosis need to be implemented. This is why the concept of a healthy diet providing adequate amounts of various micronutrients deserves mention. Actually, within Europe, conspicuous differences is encountered in the severity of osteoporosis, the lowest incidence being reported in the Mediterranean area [3], where olive oil consumption is high, as well as sun shining for vitamin D. Our results, using an extensively valued model that is sensitive to various inhibitors of bone resorption used clinically [28], show that virgin olive oil exhibited synergistic bone sparing effect with vitamin D.  Scientific value of the experimental protocol The ovariectomized rodent is, by far, the most widely used animal model for post-menopausal osteoporosis. Actually, characteristics of skeletal physiology in the murine model share similarities with those of early post-menopausal women, in many respects.",24a2bba4-21da-49d8-b602-068455404888
33,discussion1," These include: increase rate of bone turnover with resorption exceeding formation, greater loss of cancellous than cortical bone; and similar skeletal response to various stimuli.  In the present study, as expected and previously shown [29], ovariectomy (confirmed by uterine atrophy) was associated with impaired femoral bone mineral density (BMD), whatever the compartment (cortical bone, primary and secondary spongiosa). Comparative results, i.e. 4% reduction in the femoral cortical bone mineral density (BMD) with ovariectomy, were found on a similar model: 12 weeks-old C57Bl/6 ovariectomized for 4 weeks, in which mice were subjected to a standard diet [30]. This was consistent with the micro-architectural data, as indicated by raised marrow area, porosity and trabecular space, while bone area/volume, cortical thickness and trabeculae number were diminished, compared to what was observed in the SH animals.",df94a3bf-bffa-45ce-a384-b3f0e3e64913
34,discussion2," Moreover bone remodeling was accelerated in ovariectomized rats consuming virgin olive oil (increased bone biomarkers). This was corroborated by mechanistic analysis, genes involved in bone turnover being up-regulated by estrogen deprivation, as well. This increased bone remodeling, with resorption exceeding formation following ovariectomy, is well described in the literature [28], [31]. Ovarian ablation was also associated with an enhanced oxidative stress, as shown by over expression of Nos2. Estrogen deficiency is known to decrease defense against oxidative stress, which leads to bone loss [32]–[34]. Indeed, the Nos2 promoter has been shown to be under negative estrogen control [35]. This is why a stimulation of nitric oxide production by Nos2 was reported in an experimental ovariectomized (OVX) animal model and was associated with a 320% higher osteoblast apoptosis [36], [37].",1c87d0fc-8b8d-449e-9662-a62d775d6cd9
35,discussion3," In a clinical trial, F2-isoprostane levels, a marker of oxidative stress, have been negatively associated with bone mineral density (BMD) [38]. On the opposite, in ovariectomized (OVX) rats, osteopenia can be prevented by administration of a selective inhibitor of COX-2 [39]. Regarding inflammation, in the present study, ovariectomy did not elicit any significant effect on the genes involved in such a biological process, even though a splenomegaly was observed. As a matter of fact, conflicting data have been published. TGF-β1 mRNA and proteins expression levels have been reported to be significantly decreased in ovariectomized (OVX) rats compared to sham rats [40]–[42], while a significant increase in IL-1-IL-6 was observed in women with total hysterectomy and oophorectomy [43]. This was prevented in patients treated with estrogen and in those treated with estrogens and medroxyprogesteron.",afead339-e507-4d25-b0b2-79e53b3442e4
36,discussion4,"  Effect of olive oil Olive oil, whether it was refined (depleted in polyphenols) or not, was not able to prevent the increase in body weight observed in the ovariectomized (OVX) mice. This is consistent with previous data published by our team showing that neither olive oil nor oleuropein could modify this parameter in ovariectomized (OVX) rats [17], [21].  With regards to bone health, bone mineral density (BMD) was not significantly different in the ovariectomized (OVX) mice whether they were submitted to virgin or refined olive oil consumption. In other words, olive oil, when given alone, was not efficient to prevent ovariectomized (OVX)-induced osteopenia. This was consistent with the lack of significant difference in both CTX1 and OCN serum levels between those two groups. Consistently with our data, Puel et al. [17], [21] failed to see a bone sparing effect of oleuropein, olives, and olive oil.",2cb0a6ae-78f4-4d0e-923e-244e9c560e58
37,discussion5," They provided evidence of efficiency of such nutrients and foods in ovariectomized (OVX) rats only when inflammation was exacerbated. The recent study conducted by Keiler et al. [44] in which a similar amount of polyphenols (10 mg/kg body weight) was evaluated corroborates our data as well. On the contrary, according to Hagiwara et al. [19] and Saleh and Saleh [18], oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and olive oil, respectively, but not tyrosol were found to limit trabecular but not cortical bone loss induced by ovariectomy. As a matter of fact, Saleh and Saleh [18] found a positive impact of polyphenols by giving twice our and Keiler’s dose (i.e. 20 mg/kg body weight). Finally, in elderly men at high cardiovascular risk, a Mediterranean-type diet enriched with olive oil was associated with increased osteocalcin and PINP serum levels [45].",85dbf259-3965-43f2-9cdc-4e58d4293277
38,discussion6,"  Virgin olive oil and vitamin D3 act synergistically to prevent osteopenia on ovariectomized (OVX) mice Ovariectomy-induced bone loss was prevented (both at the cortical and trabecular levels) by the combination of virgin olive oil and vitamin D3, but not by virgin olive oil alone, or even by refined olive oil and vitamin D. Therefore, our data support the idea that the beneficial impact of the Mediterranean diet involves, at least in part, olive oil. This food combination could be part of a strategy to restrain the development of osteoporosis and such a beneficial effect could be explained by exacerbation of the polyphenol-bone sparing properties thanks to vitamin D. Even though the impact of olive oil could be attributed to its fatty acids [46], [47], the lack of effect of the refined oil allows avoiding this hypothesis and polyphenols are thought to be at the origin of olive oil beneficial impact on bone [48].",a09ea16a-ea47-45bc-8849-65f9391d301e
39,discussion7," We should not exclude the contribution of other micronutrients, such as, for example, tocopherols that are known to be decreased by refining.  In the present case, the combination of virgin olive oil and vitamin D3 indeed slowed down the ovariectomy-accelerated bone turnover. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses showed that osteoblastic and osteoclastic markers were down-regulated in VO-ovariectomized (OVX)-VD3 mice compared to the other ovariectomized (OVX) groups (Fig. 6). Therefore, bone turnover was likely to be slowed down in this group and this led to a higher primary spongiosa and cortical bone mineral density (BMD). Oleuropein, the major olive oil polyphenol, has previously been shown to stimulate osteoblastogenesis in vitro by increasing the expression of Runx2, osterix, Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Col1a1 in mesenchymal stem cells, while adipogenesis was inhibited [22]. Besides, Hagiwara et al.",4db2bbbb-1ef5-41e4-b3ed-7d4dbc5b21eb
40,discussion8," [19] showed that oleuropein can increase calcium deposition by osteoblasts, and oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol can reduce osteoclastogenesis. On another hand, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has been shown to directly enhance osteoblasts mineralization [49]. Recent meta-analysis showed that vitamin D in addition to calcium can reduce the risk of hip fracture [27], [50].  10.1371/journal.pone.0115817.g006Figure 6 Schematic representation of the bone sparing effect of virgin olive oil enriched with vitamin D3.

The bone sparing effect observed in the animals that were given the combination of virgin olive oil and vitamin D was concomitant with decreased oxidative stress and inflammation gene expressions. Bone metabolism is impaired in the presence of an excess of reactive oxygen species, which leads to bone loss [37], [51]. The Mediterranean diet has been shown to decrease the incidence of oxidative stress which is implicated in the evolution of many diseases [52].",76d57e17-a630-43de-a95b-deaf15dfef75
42,discussion10," Moreover, polyphenols are known to have an anti-oxidant impact [53]–[55]. As a matter of fact, extra virgin olive oil and black Luckes olives were found to counteract the increased oxidative stress induced by estrogen deficiency [16], [18]. In rats which were subjected to virgin olive oil, oxidative stress parameters have been shown to be decreased in brain, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle as well [56]–[58]. The capacity of olive oil polyphenols to decrease the expression of COX-2 and Nos2 has been described in different cell types [59]–[65].  Regarding inflammation, virgin olive oil enriched with polyphenols has been shown to exhibit protective effects in two models of inflammation [53]. Puel et al. [16], [17], [20], [21] also demonstrated that olives, olive oil, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol can prevent bone loss in an inflammation model of ovariectomized rats and this was partly explained by lower plasma fibrinogen and α1-acid glycoprotein levels.",0bd86ab0-4e07-4c55-bb62-5d8be563221b
43,discussion11," It has been proposed that the anti-inflammatory impact of extra virgin olive oil could act through the NF-kappaB pathway [66]. Unfortunately, we were unable to test this gene. Our transciptomic analyses showed a protective impact of virgin olive oil associated with vitamin D3 compared to refined olive oil associated with vitamin D3 on the following markers for both oxidative stress and inflammation: Nos2, IL-6, CCl2, Tlr2 and Tlr4. In the same way, in the human study published by Fito et al. [67], IL-6 was decreased in the volunteers consuming virgin olive oil compared to refined olive oil.  In conclusion, our study shows that virgin olive oil fortified with vitamin D3 is able to counteract the bone loss induced by estrogen deprivation. Such a bone sparing effect could be explained by an improvement of both inflammation status and oxidative stress.",739c4084-c93a-4aff-8157-dedc57161a79
44,discussion12," Thus, although further data are required, virgin olive oil fortified with vitamin D might be a potential nutritional alternative for osteoporosis prevention.
