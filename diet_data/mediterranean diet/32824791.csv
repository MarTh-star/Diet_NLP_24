0,methods0," 2.1. Search Strategy and Study Selection  This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews Meta-Analysis (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews Meta Analysis (PRISMA)) guidelines. To identify pertinent articles, we searched the PubMed and SCOPUS databases up to March 2021 using the combination of the following keywords: (“ultraprocessed food*” OR “ultra-processed food*” OR “NOVA system” OR “NOVA classification” OR “minimally processed food”) AND (“intake” OR “consumption”). Reference lists of included manuscripts and relevant reviews were examined for any possible unidentified study.  Studies were included if they: (i) provided information on ultra processed food (UPF) consumption expressed as the percentage of energy for each NOVA category with respect to total dietary intake; (ii) provided information for the general population or for at least one target group; (iii) were published in the English language.",52bcae98-96db-49c8-8d79-36bd24fd0c84
1,methods1," Conversely, studies were excluded if they: (i) were published before 2009; (ii) did not use the NOVA classification; (iii) were systematic reviews or meta-analyses; (iv) expressed ultra processed food (UPF) intake as tertiles/quartiles without providing information about the net consumption.  2.2. Data Extraction and Presentation  Data from included papers were extracted by two reviewers (M.M. and F.P.). Any discrepancy between the reviewers was resolved through consultation with a third independent author (C.D.B) to achieve consensus. The following information is reported: (i) authors and year of publication; (ii) country; (iii) characteristics of the population under study; (iv) method of dietary assessment; (v) results expressed as a percentage of energy from ultra processed food (UPF) compared to total energy intake.",4d0a3db2-b417-4ee5-8506-58219bf47f55
2,methods2," Studies are summarized in different tables showing the percentage of energy intake (the percentage of energy intake (TEI)) from ultra processed food (UPF) compared to total energy intake, considering the main factors such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Data are reported as the mean or median value followed by the standard deviation (SD), standard error of the mean (standard error of the mean (SEM)), confidence interval (CI), or interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)). When available, the statistical significance is reported.  3. Results  3.1. Study Selection  A total of 1051 studies, conducted between 2009 and 2021, were identified using the PubMed and SCOPUS databases. After eliminating 414 duplicates, 434 articles were excluded based on the titles and abstracts, and 97 studies were removed based on the full-text assessment. A total of 106 articles met the inclusion criteria so were included in the final analysis.",6c13458a-1ffd-4408-a32a-f9a4e36a3e20
3,methods3," Among these, five studies led to two different articles each, which were therefore considered as unique studies. Thus, at the end of the process, a total of 99 unique studies were included (Figure 1).  3.2. Characteristics of the Studies  Among the 99 studies, a total of 1,378,454 subjects were considered, with the number of subjects ranging from 40 [14] to 110,260 [15]. On average, the age of participants was 38.9 years, although half of the studies did not report this information. Fifteen studies focused only on children [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30], seven on adolescents [31,32,33,34,35,36,37], five on pregnant women [38,39,40,41,42], and three on older subjects [43,44,45], whereas others focused on an adult population or on ≥2 target groups. Overall, 58.8% of participants were women.  The number of studies performed in different countries is reported in Figure 2.",ff9f5501-bddc-422e-8ce3-be458318a629
4,methods4," As shown, Brazil had the highest number of studies (n = 38), followed by the United States (n = 15), France (n = 8), the United Kingdom (n = 6), Canada (n = 6), and Spain (n = 4). Fewer studies were performed in Malaysia, (n = 3), and in other countries such as Mexico, Italy, Australia, Korea, and Portugal (n = 2); only one study each was conducted in Chile, Japan, Indonesia, Lebanon, Israel, the Netherlands, Colombia, Belgium, and New Zealand.  Regarding the method of dietary assessment, the 24 h recall was the most-used tool (n = 62), followed by food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs) (n = 28) and food diaries (n = 10).  3.3. Levels of ultra processed food (UPF) Intake  The levels of consumption of ultra processed food (UPF) shown in the retrieved studies are reported in Table 1, while results stratified for specific target groups are provided in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4.",bba8800e-bc4e-448c-be99-25a7680fe53f
5,methods5,"  The data revealed a high variability in terms of the percentage (%) of energy provided by the consumption of food belonging to group 4 based on the NOVA classification. Similar findings were observed both intra- and inter-country. The highest levels of consumption were observed in the United States and the United Kingdom with the percent of energy intake generally higher than 50% with respect to the percentage of energy intake (TEI) [18,19,36,38,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54]. Conversely, the lowest levels were observed in Italy, in which the two studies identified reported about 10% energy obtained from ultra processed food (UPF) [55,56].  Regarding the variability within the same country, Brazil showed levels of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption ranging from 7.7% in 64 subjects aged 25–57 years [57] to 51.2% of total energy intake in over 4200 subjects [58].",4250ddf1-92ee-4e49-872f-d955543cef77

Several studies stratified data based on different characteristics, such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). The level of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption stratified for these parameters is reported in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4. Slight differences between the sexes were observed in ultra processed food (UPF) intake, with men having often an overall higher intake compared to women [48,54,87,95,96,111]. However, in most of the studies, the levels of ultra processed food (UPF) intake appeared comparable [14,30,49,51,81,83,94,112] (Table 2). Regarding age, studies generally reported large variations amongst the age groups.",c1232eb1-5d22-47ae-95ea-33b83556688b

Only five studies also stratified results based on body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) of the participants, generally finding a slight, but higher, ultra processed food (UPF) intake in subjects with the highest body mass index (BMI) (e.g., greater than 30 kg/m2) [58,87,89,95] (Table 4) [58].  nutrients-13-02778-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Level of consumption of ultra-processed foods (ultra processed food (UPF)) expressed as percent energy provided by ultra processed food (UPF) intake with respect to total energy intake (the percentage of energy intake (TEI)) considering sex.

14,methods57," This latter consumed more ultra processed food (UPF) compared to the intervention group that received training for the application of healthy food practices during prenatal care appointments (see Supplementary Table S1). Finally, Gehring and colleagues [85,86] compared ultra processed food (UPF) intake in subjects adhering to different dietary patterns, observing a higher ultra processed food (UPF) intake in vegans and vegetarians than pesco-vegetarians and meat eaters (Supplementary Table S1).  4. Discussion  Since Monteiro et al. proposed the NOVA classification to categorize foods based on the degree of processing [4], several studies have been conducted to estimate the level of consumption of ultra processed food (UPF) and its association with several health markers [24,35,52,67,120] as well as with disease risk and mortality [55,59,87,121,122], adjusting the models for energy intake and other potential confounding factors.",b58ed241-ca36-47be-8587-b4a1d3cc1bb8
15,methods58," It was hypothesized that a high level of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption may represent a health issue, being associated with weight gain and worsening of cardiovascular risk factors such as high waist circumference and low HDL cholesterol [11].  In the present study, we collected 100 unique studies published in 106 manuscripts estimating the ultra processed food (UPF) levels in different populations from 21 countries around the world. Overall, we found a large variability in the percent of the percentage of energy intake (TEI) obtained from ultra processed food (UPF) in the different countries, with the United States and United Kingdom being the countries with the highest percent of the percentage of energy intake (TEI) from ultra processed food (UPF), and Mediterranean countries such as Italy showing the lowest level (~10% of the percentage of energy intake (TEI)).",b0171ee2-2ee6-4e5c-917e-1582b2a61399
16,methods59," These results are in line with previous evidence suggesting that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is inversely associated with ultra processed food (UPF) consumption [20]. This is further confirmed by findings showing that the highest tertiles or quartiles of ultra processed food (UPF) intake are associated with the lowest adherence to the Mediterranean diet [44,55]. The low levels of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption registered in Italy and other Mediterranean countries are those associated with the lowest risks for non-communicable diseases. For instance, da Silva et al. recently observed an association between ultra processed food (UPF) consumption and the increased presence of high waist circumference, overweight, and peripheral arterial disease when comparing the third and first tertiles of the ultra processed food (UPF) contribution to energy intake in a Brazilian cohort [123]. Intriguingly, the first tertile corresponded to <10.",693c5492-7171-463d-8f3d-48e4d12ad08a
17,methods60,"6% of the percentage of energy intake (TEI) from ultra processed food (UPF), which is similar to the levels registered in the study conducted in the Italian population. These levels are far lower than those detected in the first quartiles in the study by Rauber et al., who observed that participants in the highest quartile (>70.3% and >71.7% of the percentage of energy intake (TEI) from ultra processed food (UPF) in women and men, respectively) had a significantly higher risk of developing obesity, and of experiencing a ≥5% increase in body mass index (BMI) waist circumference than those belonging to the lowest quartile (<24.1% and <26.3% of the percentage of energy intake (TEI) from ultra processed food (UPF) in women and men, respectively) [47].",aed9bae5-2712-4e42-a4c8-707636513298
18,methods61," The type of foods contributing to ultra processed food (UPF) intake largely varied among countries, but, in accordance with previous findings [124], the most consumed ultra processed food (UPF) included: baked goods, dairy products, processed fruit and vegetables, and, among drinks, carbonated drinks.  In addition to country, the level of ultra processed food (UPF) intake was found to be inversely associated with the increase in age. In this regard, children generally showed the highest intake of ultra processed food (UPF), which led the European Childhood Obesity Group to “a call to action” aimed to inform people about the potential harmful effects of ultra processed food (UPF) [118]. For example, it was found that in the United Kingdom, 65% of calories eaten by primary and secondary school children derived from white bread, biscuits, carbonated drinks, crisps, and chips. These findings are in line with the observations reported by others [125,126].",0f7cf274-5e4d-456a-a146-8ec7ae1b735d
19,methods62," Similarly, the pediatric populations of the United States and Canada reported an intake of ultra processed food (UPF) above 55% by including breads, cookies, savory snacks, reconstituted meat products, milk-based drinks, breakfast cereals, juices and sodas, and frozen and ready-to-eat meals in the diet [18,96]. Among U.S. school-aged children and adolescents, ultra processed food (UPF) provided 66.2% and 66.4% of the percentage of energy intake (TEI), respectively, with pizzas, sodas, and juices being the most-consumed products [118]. In this scenario, it was proposed that the levels of ultra processed food (UPF) intake in the young may reflect, at least in part, their lifestyle. In this regard, a recent study documented that subjects consume more ultra processed food (UPF) when dining out than when eating at home [127].",aede9370-8382-46ef-aab4-446df9b2bd27
20,methods63," Other reasons are related to socio-economic inequalities, including lower education status of the mother or unemployed parents, which may lead to a preference for cheaper and less nutritious foods [105]. A different trend was observed for older subjects who showed a lower intake of ultra processed food (UPF) compared to younger subjects; the main ultra processed food (UPF) products included cookies and pastries, but also processed breads, breakfast cereals, and yogurts [16,128]. Compared to age, a minor variability was found for sex and/or body mass index (BMI), which might differ for the net amount of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption but not for the percent of the percentage of energy intake (TEI) from ultra processed food (UPF). Intriguingly, the adherence to specific dietary patterns represented an additional determinant of the levels of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption.",0ab3ea34-d89f-40af-80c3-5bd77e58ca24
21,methods64," In this context, based on the NOVA classification, vegans and vegetarians reported higher ultra processed food (UPF) consumption compared to pesco-vegetarians and meat eaters, mainly driven by a higher consumption of plant-based meat and dairy substitutes. These results highlight the high variability in the characteristics of these types of diet, which may differ widely for the consumption of several food groups [129]. However, these results were found only in two different publications belonging to the same cross-sectional trial performed in the NutriNet-Santé cohort [85,86]; thus, a confirmation of such an analysis deserves further investigation, also to comprehend better if all vegetarian diets have the same health benefits regardless of the levels of ultra processed food (UPF) consumed.  A thorough comparison of the findings from the different studies considered was challenging due to the differences in food classification and to the disparate definitions that were proposed.",1438c5ba-2502-46d8-ae0f-17db9e261fc8
22,methods65," Descriptions of ultra processed food (UPF) within the NOVA system vary with distinguishing features including single vs. 2–3 vs. ≥5 more ingredients, or natural/fresh vs. imitation or industrial, and whole foods vs. fractioned substances [13]. This means that different studies may have classified the same food as ultra processed food (UPF) or not based on the distinguishing feature used for classifying foods.  Notably, one of the main sources of variation among study protocols is the tools used for estimating ultra processed food (UPF) intake. Overall, from the present review, it is difficult to provide conclusive findings about the influence of the tools used to determine ultra processed food (UPF) intake since its estimation was typically performed using a single method. In this regard, most of the studies (n = 49) used the 24 h recall.",9efd59d6-375c-42ef-82cf-cb2be459e627
23,methods66," To reflect the typical diet, this tool needs to be administered several times; however, in some studies, data were derived from a single 24 h recall, which could have affected the significance of the findings. However, this tool has the strength of being able to assess the consumption of all food items since subjects can include/report specific information (e.g., brand), which may help with identifying the NOVA group. However, a lower number of studies assessed ultra processed food (UPF) intake using FFQs, which are not always specifically created and validated to estimate the consumption of products undergoing different food processing, and the food list cannot cover all the food items consumed, thus leading to underreporting [130].",5c0def3a-d81b-48df-a18c-8840ddb195e9
24,methods67," Among studies using FFQs, some of them used the questionnaire developed within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) [131], which is not able to distinguish among products belonging to different NOVA groups. This is, for instance, the case for artisanal or industrial breads or cakes that belong to two different NOVA groups (Groups 3 and 4, respectively). Therefore, the use of tools not specifically validated for estimating ultra processed food (UPF) consumption may potentially lead to the misclassification of foods in the ultra processed food (UPF) categories, which, in turn, may lead to the misinterpretation of the associations found with markers of health. Only two studies [17,51] used a questionnaire specifically validated for estimating the levels of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption in children and adults.",35ce5130-9c2e-4adf-8c0c-d4bb19ab8696
25,methods68," The approach to validating and using ad hoc developed FFQs, when possible, created for specific populations to consider the different dietary habits, should be recommended for more accurately estimating the consumption of ultra processed food (UPF) and the actual impact on health-related outcomes.  This study has some strengths worth highlighting, the first of which is the rigorous search and selection strategy that identified available studies examining the energy intake from ultra processed food (UPF). However, we cannot exclude that the use of further databases may have allowed the identification of additional studies. Secondly, food processing level was always determined according to the criteria of NOVA classification, to facilitate the comparison amongst findings, although it was reported that some NOVA definitions are open to researchers’ interpretation [132], leading to a not-always-uniform categorization [133].",b7a24736-a0fe-46e4-a891-f1ac1af14611
26,methods69," Finally, we included only studies reporting results as the percent of the percentage of energy intake (TEI) from ultra processed food (UPF) and not as grams per day. In our opinion, the ratio of energy intake from ultra processed food (UPF) compared to total energy intake is more useful for reflecting the impact of these products on the whole diet. However, this method may not be useful for detecting the consumption of energy-free products (such as energy-free drinks with artificial sweeteners); thus, this choice can also be considered as a limitation. Notably, the NOVA system used has been largely criticized for different reasons, mostly because this system focuses on the role of food processing, regardless of the nutritional characteristics of foods, on human health [132]. Thus, further efforts should be directed toward elucidating the impact of the different foods belonging to the same NOVA category but with different nutrient profiles on human health.",5df97869-db77-4caf-8ced-e5eba09812c5
27,methods70," To conclude, it seems worthwhile to implement a critical and constructive discussion able to clarify the potential and applicability of this type of approach.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, this review showed high levels of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption, especially in some countries and in specific target groups (i.e., children and adolescents). However, most of the data on ultra processed food (UPF) consumption have been derived from FFQs and 24 h dietary recall, which are not specifically validated for estimating ultra processed food (UPF); thus, such data should be considered with caution. In this scenario, tools specifically validated to estimate the levels of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption can be useful to avoid misinterpretation of the findings, especially when used to investigate the association with health status.",2b62ea4a-9664-42e8-93b1-d2145a81ffc7
28,methods71," Despite several studies reporting a positive association between ultra processed food (UPF) and obesity and cardiometabolic health, on the whole, the evidence is not yet totally convincing. In addition, whether this association is dependent on the nutritional characteristics of ultra processed food (UPF) and/or related to the applied processing is unclear. In this context, despite the NOVA system classifying foods based on the food processing technology without providing any information about the nutritional content of the food, the ultra processed food (UPF) group has been suggested to be an indicator of poor food quality due to the generally high amounts of free or added sugars, fats, low levels of fiber, and high energy density.",4b158ed6-aed9-4679-9779-75fa83471775
29,methods72," For instance, it was recently observed that ultra processed food (UPF) consumption is associated with a deterioration in diet quality, with ultra processed food (UPF) intake being negatively correlated with fiber and protein and positively correlated with sugar, fat, and saturated fat intake [115]. This highlights that the concept of ultra processed food (UPF) may be somehow misleading, with the effect on human health mediated more by the nutritional quality of products rather than the processing. The association between ultra processed food (UPF) and nutritional adequacy is not surprising, since, for instance, the presence of added sugar or fat is a major element in defining ultra processed food (UPF). Finally, the classification systems based on processing are not often aligned with dietary guidelines (e.g., some products considered ultra processed food (UPF) are recommended within a balanced diet).",34c6fb81-41de-4a65-8952-075b64f0dbb5
30,methods73," Thus, confirmation of the results already obtained should be accompanied by an evaluation of the association between ultra processed food (UPF) consumption and health status, estimating the contribution within different dietary patterns. ",05d7df8e-9f67-4e5e-9795-0f171734a263
