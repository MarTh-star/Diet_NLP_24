0,methods0,"In this registry-based study we used the official mortality register data to analyze the mortality patterns on seven Croatian islands (Brač, Hvar, Korčula, Lastovo, Mljet, Šolta, and Vis) and Pelješac peninsula in the 1998-2013 period and calculated the average lifespan, life expectancy, and standardized mortality ratios (standardized mortality ratios (SMR)). We compared the leading causes of death with those in the mainland population of two southernmost Croatian counties. ",9691a97f-11df-4992-bcc7-e6128b3f39a4
1,analysis0,"Normality of variables’ distribution was tested by small-samples Shapiro-Wilk test. χ2 test was used for assessing the significance of differences between categorical variables and t test for numerical variables. The level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. All analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 19.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA licensed to the University of Edinburgh, UK). ",3e0398d7-0258-4b38-9d7a-1f5a8130e5f7
2,results0,"Over the investigated period there were 91 954 death cases in the Split-Dalmatia and Dubrovnik-Neretva counties, 11 837 (12.9%) of which occurred in the investigated islands (Table 1). Mean age at death (average lifespan) of the island population strongly deviated from the mainland, with island men living 3-10 years longer and island women living 2-7 years longer than their mainland counterparts, with especially long lifespan observed on Mljet. The calculation of life expectancies across the investigated islands yielded rather unified results, without specific patterns. Mljet and Lastovo had somewhat higher estimates, but with a substantial overlap of confidence intervals, suggesting no difference from the mainland estimates (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1)(supplementary Table 1).",257373f1-2ae4-4fc0-b3d5-1b31127cde82
3,results1,"  standardized mortality ratios (SMR) analysis suggested marked differences from the mainland, including significantly lower standardized mortality ratios (SMR)s in both men and women on Korčula, Brač, Mljet, and Pelješac (Table 2). Significantly lower standardized mortality ratios (SMR)s were found only in men on Lastovo and Hvar, while the remaining standardized mortality ratios (SMR)s did not indicate any differences. A single exception was the island of Šolta, where women had significantly higher standardized mortality ratios (SMR)s than the mainland population (Table 2).

4,discussion0,"Our results suggest a diverse mortality pattern on Southern Dalmatian islands. While the overall lifespan was longer on the islands with more favorable standardized mortality ratios (SMR)s, we did not detect any differences in life expectancy at birth. When taken together, these results suggest that elderly islanders have been experiencing more favorable conditions, while in younger generations this protective “island” effect is reduced. These results agree with some previous studies, pointing out diminishing adherence to the Mediterranean diet and lifestyle (21-23). An alternative solution could be a “sick” migrant effect, which occurs when individuals with chronic diseases are moving to the coast, to be closer to the health care facilities. Opposed to this is the “healthy” migrant effect, occurring when healthy individuals take part in directional migration (24).",498e8f6e-295f-4834-940d-a9469efce790
5,discussion1,"  Disease-specific mortality rates also showed an interesting result, with higher cardiovascular diseases burden in men on the islands and correspondingly lesser burden for all three leading groups of death causes in women. One of the most parsimonious explanations for this could be their behavior, predominantly Mediterranean diet and lifestyle. This fits into the previous hypothesis of reduced health protection in recent generations, as several previous studies have described diminishing adherence to Mediterranean diet and worse medical outcomes (10,15,17). There could also be different underlying disease mechanisms due to genetic make-up of island populations. Having this in mind, the use of resources such as the 10 001 Dalmatians project could be a perfect example of translating basic research to provide opportunities for personalized medicine (5,25-27).",ae79ac19-f080-4e2b-b5e8-304df384b45e
6,discussion2,"  These results also confirm the previous finding of the island-specific disease profiles (5), which require the development and adherence to island-specific health policies. This is one of the most salient results of this study in terms of health care delivery and health policy, suggesting that “one size fits all” approach in terms of island health is insufficient, and that every island with larger permanent population should receive special attention and develop its own health strategy, in order to provide equitable health care across the entire population.  The first limitation of our study is that the mortality data analysis was encumbered by numerous effect modifiers, which can cause substantial deviations and must always be considered very carefully to prevent biased conclusions.",7a9f0fe7-74f6-499f-af25-63df2f6961cc
7,discussion3," The effect modifiers extend from the methodological limitations in the use of standardized mortality ratios (SMR)s and life expectancies, which may have produced artifacts in the data analysis and interpretation (16). An additional possible cause of bias of unknown direction is the unknown extent of directional migrations. The second limitation stemmed from small sample sizes, leading to low statistical power, especially in the case of smaller islands. The observed mortality pattern might not reflect the morbidity patterns, especially if there are differences in clinical courses and outcomes between islands and the mainland. Lastly, there could be substantial differences in the quality of coroner services across the islands, possibly causing systematic bias toward higher cardiovascular burden.",b80c10ab-16aa-4a4b-a8d2-12b6e9f37a5a
