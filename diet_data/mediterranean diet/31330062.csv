0,introduction0,"Social determinants can explain health inequalities between and within countries, which should be tackled through Public Health interventions1. In general, low socioeconomic status (socioeconomic status (SES))—expressed in terms of educational level, employment and income—is associated with earlier onset of age-related chronic diseases and higher risk of death2,3. Socio-economic disadvantaged individuals tend to fare worse with regards to non-communicable diseases (non communicable diseases (NCD)) risk factors, which include unhealthy behaviors2–6. Thus, strategies aiming to reduce health disparities should also include the promotion of healthy behaviors (e.g. diet, smoking habits and physical activity), which are considered as risk factors for several health conditions and diseases7.",37c91119-edf4-4043-a02e-c574a90c1b0b
1,introduction1,"   Social disadvantages and unhealthy behaviors—occurring either in utero and during lifetime—may induce sustainable biological changes involved in individual non communicable diseases (NCD) risk profile8,9. Despite recent strides in this field of research, molecular mechanisms involved are still not fully understood. For this reason, uncovering the epigenetic mechanisms underpinning this relationship might offer a plausible explanation of the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on human health. For instance, several lines of evidence have demonstrated that socioeconomic disadvantage significantly affected DNA methylation process, which resulted in aberrant gene expression and genome instability involved in chronic diseases and aging10. Social inequalities alone, however, do not completely explain socioeconomic difference in DNA methylation level, and further studies are required to unveil what factors contribute to it.",4d91aa5d-607b-40e0-80fe-ef40c51bd554
2,introduction2," Recent studies have also suggested that behaviors had different effects on global DNA methylation in exposed individuals and in future generations11. Some of these findings were obtained using the methylation status of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1) sequences as a surrogate marker of global DNA methylation. Despite doubts about its validity as surrogate marker, aberrant methylation of these sequences might affect their independent and autonomous retro-transposition, leading to chromosomal instability and altered gene expression12,13. Moreover, previous evidence from preclinical and epidemiological studies suggested how dietary factors (i.e. nutrients, foods, and dietary patterns)14–18, smoking habits19,20, physical activity21 and weight status22 might affect DNA methylation process and LINE-1 methylation levels.  In this scenario, our hypothesis was that the behaviors (i.e.",69f47177-f4f7-43e4-b2f1-532d51626eb5

With respect to employment status, 54.2% of women were unemployed while 21.2% and 24.6% were part-time or full-time employed, respectively.  Socioeconomic differences in LINE-1 methylation We first compared LINE-1 methylation levels across categories of socioeconomic status (SES), expressed as educational level (Fig. 1a) and employment status (Fig. 1b). We observed that LINE-1 methylation level increased with increasing educational level (p < 0.001).

20,discussion0,"The present study investigates potential behavioral mediators of socioeconomic differences in leukocyte LINE-1 methylation. Since LINE-1 elements are among the most common transposable sequences of the genome (with more than 500,000 copies), their methylation status has been widely used as a surrogate marker of global DNA methylation23. The maintenance of DNA methylation of CpG sites within LINE-1 sequences helps to prevent chromosomal instability, DNA rearrangement and alteration of gene expression12,13, which in turn might affect the risk for cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases24–26.  Among women without previous or current history of severe diseases, we first explored the association of socioeconomic status (SES) and LINE-1 methylation, using educational level and employment status as proxy indicators. Notably, women in the highest socioeconomic classes exhibited higher LINE-1 methylation level than their disadvantaged counterpart.",9eb75178-8741-4967-8205-a25f4f4917a7
21,discussion1," Yet, educational level seemed the strongest predictor of LINE-1 methylation when both socioeconomic status (SES) indicators were evaluated simultaneously. This was in line with the current notion that life experiences—especially during the early life—affect epigenetic marks in specific loci of the genome27. In particular, several studies—mostly conducted on animals—showed that social stress, isolation, and contextual uncertainty were associated with changes in CpG methylation of promoter regions27,28. In addition, epidemiological studies demonstrated that adversity in early life was related to aberrant methylation profiles in adolescents and adults29,30. More recently, Fiorito and colleagues observed a graded relationship between socioeconomic status (SES)—defined with various social indicators—and accelerated biological aging31,32.",29bd8b2f-4abe-48bb-ba77-dd96901bf1d1
22,discussion2," They obtained consistent results using two alternative predictors of accelerated biological aging based on DNA methylation at 353 CpG sites and 71 CpG sites, respectively31,32. These predictors, also known as ‘epigenetic clocks’, allow the estimation of biological aging as the difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age.  In our study, women with high educational level were also more likely to be normal weight, to perform more physical activity and to adhere more to MD than those with low educational level. For this reason, we also assessed whether lifestyle-related behaviors might affect LINE-1 methylation levels. In line with previous evidence15,17,33, we noted that women with high adherence to MD exhibited higher LINE-1 methylation levels that their unhealthy counterpart. These findings suggested that adherence to MD might partially explain and mediate socioeconomic differences in LINE-1 methylation level.",735c2a99-a209-445e-8687-b4ffdc0209aa
23,discussion3," To test this hypothesis, we assessed changes in the effect of educational level on LINE-1 methylation, adjusting for age (i.e. confounder) and adherence to MD (i.e. mediator). Specifically, adherence to MD was considered as a mediator since it was related to educational level and it was simultaneously associated with LINE-1 methylation. However, only ~ 10% of socioeconomic difference in LINE-1 methylation could be explained by adherence to MD, while residual difference was likely attributable to unmeasured factors. In fact, our analyses demonstrated that none of the other behaviors represented a potential mediator of the relationship between educational level and LINE-1 methylation. Similarly, the above mentioned study by Fiorito and colleagues aimed to investigate the role of behaviors in mediating the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and accelerated biological aging31,32.",9586d29f-9c88-4635-9502-cacd5a9142dc
24,discussion4," However, their mediation analysis did not demonstrate a significant reduction of the association magnitude due to the inclusion of behaviors in the model31,32. They concluded that the association was robust to adjustment for mediators, with a partial effect attenuation when including smoking status in the model31,32. In our study, we observed that former and non-smokers exhibited higher LINE-1 methylation level than current smokers. Although mechanisms underpinning the effect of smoking on DNA methylation are not clearly understood yet, our findings were consistent with the belief that cigarette smoke is an environmental modifiers of DNA methylation34. However, cigarette smoking did non interact with adherence to MD, and therefore the latter cannot counteract the detrimental effect on LINE-1 methylation observed among current smokers. Moreover, the absence of relationship between educational level and smoking status ruled out one of the requirements for a significant mediating effect.",edb1b3eb-180f-4eb2-b19b-34d11b554454
25,discussion5,"  Our study had some limitations. Firstly, the cross-sectional design did not allow us to understand the causal link between diet and LINE-1 methylation. This is particular important when interpreting results from the mediation analysis. Indeed, mediation analysis has become a very popular approach and a potential alternative to causal inference methods35. Despite its promising perspectives, there are some concerns about its applicability to epidemiological data36. In our study, we evaluated all the preliminary requirements necessary to conduct a mediation analysis (i.e. evaluation of total effect and of all pathways involved in the mediating effect, comparison between direct and indirect effects, evaluation of alternative mediators)35. Yet in spite of this, our approach relied on cross-sectional data, which can lead to misrepresented conclusions if compared to longitudinal research37.",43fb4950-0fd5-474f-863b-396705a82024
26,discussion6," From a biological point of view, the hypothesized pathway by which behaviors mediated the effect of social factors on DNA methylation was reasonable. However, caution is needed when interpreting our findings and further prospective studies on this topic should be encouraged.  Another limitation of our study regarded the debate on the potential application of LINE-1 methylation as a surrogate marker of global DNA methylation. In fact, heterogeneity in LINE-1 methylation levels across CpG sites and tissues38–42 hindered the comparisons between different studies. Despite these issues, aberrant LINE-1 methylation still remains an interesting molecular mechanisms in the research on cancer and other non communicable diseases (NCD)s24–26.  Finally, data collection was performed by subjective methods that did not preclude errors and inaccuracy. In fact, the Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ) used for dietary assessment was prone to a degree of misreporting43.",dc60420e-1dad-4487-a9b0-01aee20f2371
27,discussion7," However, this tool has been developed and validated among women from Southern Italy44, and current findings were consistent with previous studies conducted on similar cohorts45–49. Moreover, we cannot evaluate the potential effect of additional social factors (e.g. income, household size and composition), confounders (e.g. genetic variants and environmental exposure), and mediators (e.g. drinking habits).  To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the mediating effect of behaviors in the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and LINE-1 methylation. Our findings confirm previous evidence that socioeconomic status (SES) is a determinant of health, also through biological changes such as epigenetic mechanisms. Notably, we propose that behaviors—especially the adherence to MD—might mediate this association, leaving room for public health interventions aimed at promoting healthy dietary habits in social disadvantaged people.",4a5b9c7b-4165-49b8-8c16-f6be45c3bf24
