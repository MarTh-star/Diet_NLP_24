Multivariate Cox regression models were constructed for the combined health lifestyle scores, with the lowest score category used as the reference category (Supplemental Table 13). The linear trend test for the lifestyle scores was performed by treating the number of low-risk factors as continuous variables. The population attributable risk (population attributable risk (PAR)) was estimated using HRs obtained from the different Cox regression models in our cohort with that in the fully adjusted model.

First, we analyzed the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk between both the simple and weighted Mediterranean diet related healthy lifestyle (MHL) scores without alcohol intake because the alcohol intake was inconsistent among previous lifestyle scores. Second, we substituted body mass index (BMI) by waist circumflex to calculate both the simple and weighted Mediterranean diet related healthy lifestyle (MHL) scores and to assess their association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Finally, we adapted each lifestyle as a categorical factor rather than dichotomous one to calculated the weighted Mediterranean diet related healthy lifestyle (MHL) score for preventive misclassification of exposure variables and exam the association robust.",3cfe18d2-4d57-46b2-8654-67c48b10644c

However, in our study wherein several clinical risk factors and biomarkers were adjusted, the cardiovascular protection conferred from a higher Life's Simple 7 score was attenuated. This decline in the preventive effect against cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence conferred from the Life's Simple 7 score implies that the protective benefits are derived more from the clinical risk factors than from lifestyle factors, which drive the score.",1dfe09f9-0fc6-4754-ac94-009cca59b463
34,discussion6," This shifts the focus from primordial prevention to primary prevention of clinical risk factors and toward the targeting of individuals with higher short-term, rather than a long-term, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.  Compared with different healthy lifestyle scores, the Mediterranean diet related healthy lifestyle (MHL) score might be more suitable for primordial prevention in populations without clinical risk factors. The different cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk performances might be explained by the different definitions of healthy diet, physical activity, and the lack of alcohol consumption or smoking. The Mediterranean diet evaluated in the Mediterranean diet related healthy lifestyle (MHL) score comprised fish as an optimal food for cardiovascular disease (CVD) protection but with limited egg and dairy in the daily dietary intake.",65a8b180-b7fb-4384-a57f-aeda2d7dc95b

However, the WCRF/AICR lifestyle score considers no alcohol intake to be an ideal lifestyle, whereas the Life's Simple 7 does not take the amount of alcohol consumption into consideration. Additionally, the non-smoker or cessation of smoking status contributed to the Mediterranean diet related healthy lifestyle (MHL) score and Life's Simple 7 score, although it was not calculated in the WCRF/AICR lifestyle score.  Multiple reasons (observed in this study) might explain the benefits derived from a healthy lifestyle in younger populations than in the elderly. First, aging is an original strong risk factor for atherosclerosis.",441e0741-5951-47ef-8a07-b705d55cece2
36,discussion8," Research has reported that even in individuals with an ideal modifiable lifestyle and healthy status, a high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk still persists among people aged 65–75 years depending on different racial influences64. Approximately 60% of the 10-year predicted atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was attributable to age alone. Additionally, the magnitude of causal association between lifestyle and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk might be reduced when age is included as a significant covariate65. Second, a legacy effect of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk from nonoptimal behavioral factors leading to a persistent pathological change even in individuals who have an optimal lifestyle has been reported recently66. Older people have a longer lifetime to experience a nonoptimal lifestyle than younger individuals, and the legacy effect of nonoptimal lifestyle behaviors should be considered.",2c950d82-3768-4ddc-b9f6-6f243057e0d1
37,discussion9," Finally, people with chronic diseases would have a stronger motivation to maintain a healthy lifestyle. However, the higher prevalence of chronic diseases among the elderly may play the role of a potential confounder in cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence, reducing the protective effect against cardiovascular disease (CVD) obtained from a healthy lifestyle.  The clinical implications include the identification of unhealthy lifestyle factors among young and middle-aged adults; aggressive healthy lifestyle interventions are crucial for improving the population’s cardiovascular health. Additionally, among populations with low short-term risks, healthy lifestyle scores in the absence of clinical risk factors independently provided additional important information about the long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and overall cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden.",25abada3-a828-4f9d-b920-71162f6199a5
38,discussion10," Furthermore, the simple Mediterranean diet related healthy lifestyle (MHL) score, as well as the weighted score, was a useful tool in primary health services, even at home and without the clinical setting, which may broaden public health screening without the need for laboratory-based measures; this may have implications for the development of health policies with different strategies from that of the primordial and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).  This study has several strengths. The TWsHHH evaluated a population of middle-aged adults with low prevalence of clinical risk factors in a national representative cohort and little loss to follow-up over 12.5 years; information was obtained on the primary lifestyle habits and direct effect measures of clinical risk factors and biomarkers.",6087cc8f-66dd-4e52-9f31-26d844c9b7d3
39,discussion11," Second, protection from the healthy lifestyle score on the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was validated in an Asian population as a primordial preventive policy in response to the 2025 global target of the World Health Organization among Western countries that extends to the Asian population. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that estimated the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk specifically from the WCRF/AICR recommended lifestyle score and compared predictive performance for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among different healthy lifestyle scores, including biomarkers. Finally, age as an effect modifier between the association was demonstrated by the primary data validation.  Nonetheless, some study limitations should be mentioned. The Mediterranean diet related healthy lifestyle (MHL) score was assessed in the TWsHHH cohort without external data validation.",bed8c4df-3912-4036-932f-00d458a533ae
40,discussion12," Additionally, lifestyle factors recorded at the baseline without repeated assessments confer a potential for non-differential misclassification in the study. Nevertheless, if the association between the healthy lifestyle score and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was significant with regard to a misclassification bias, the true relative risk among these factors should be more effective due to the subsequent repeated measurements of exposure.  Finally, although the Mediterranean diet was demonstrated to significantly reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence, the Western diet score might not be suitable for the Asian dietary habit. Further cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction studies in the Asian population should consider the locally diet pattern, such as Taiwanese Eating Approach scores67, which excluded legumes, dairy products, chicken, eggs, and sweets but included seafood (shrimp or crabs), seaweed, mushrooms, tea, fatty meats, and fermented vegetables in the scale.",37e0aeb0-a5a0-4a5d-94a6-79639c152b23
41,discussion13,"  Conclusion  Adherence to a high combined healthy lifestyle score plays an important role in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially in younger adults with low short-term risks. All simple and weighted Mediterranean diet related healthy lifestyle (MHL) scores and Life's Simple 7 have effective prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk compared with the WCRF/AICR lifestyle score in the adult Taiwanese population. Additionally, simple and weighted Mediterranean diet related healthy lifestyle (MHL) scores entirely established on lifestyle factors improved the primary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention to primordial prevention. Further investigation on the mechanism of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention based on healthy lifestyle scores independent of the clinical factors is necessary to validate these findings.
