1,methods0," National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)) 2017–18 dietary recall data in adults were used to define food examples in screener food groups based on components of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015, Diet Approach to Stop Hypertension, and Alternative Mediterranean diet approaches. Instrument Content Validity Index (I-Content Validity Index (CVI)) was used to evaluate the clarity and relevance of the screener. Patient acceptability was evaluated by completion time and response rates. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–18 food recall data were used to simulate responses to the screener items, which were evaluated for association with Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 components.

The project was considered quality improvement for patient care and determined not to require formal IRB review. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a publicly available resource for U.S. population level nutrition data that does not require data use agreements.  Screener item content validation  An iterative process was used to identify and refine items for the Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) screener. Initial food groups were included based on the components of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 [29, 30], the Alternative Mediterranean Diet [12], Diet Approach to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) [17], and the 2020 American Heart Association (American Heart Association (AHA)) Diet Goals [31] (Table 1).",adcea974-279c-4a0b-bfcd-3655eb470329

As suggested by Bailey [25], foods that subjects typically consider desserts were separated from sweet snacks and breads were separated from cereals to reduce the risk of food omissions. Expert clinical dietitians whose practice included counseling patients with cardiovascular, metabolic, or oncologic disorders added behavioral items often discussed during dietary counseling sessions (adding sugar, salt, or fat). Focus groups (n = 7 student participants) and informal feedback from patients (n = 10) were used to ensure comprehension of the items.",461f1461-2de0-497e-ab67-2a3ea633394b
5,methods4,"  The screener was made available to four clinical dietitians in paper format and in a REDCap (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) database for electronic data entry by the patient. The time required to complete the Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) screener on paper was observed and recorded by the dietitian, and the time to complete the screener online was determined by subtracting the completion time from the start time in REDCap. The willingness of patients to complete the screener was determined by the response rate to a REDCap invitation by email.  National Health and Examination Survey  The National Health and Examination Survey (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)) is a series of nationally representative studies with the purpose to assess the nutritional intake and health status of adults and children within the U.S.",c8662959-654c-4505-9cc4-cfa8bb1f63db

29,discussion1,"  The Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 measures overall diet quality relative to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans [36] and has been associated with important clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and cancer risk [1, 9, 10]. However, computation of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 score requires knowledge of both servings of foods and nutrient-level intake to compute nutrient density (per 1000 kcal, as a percentage of total kcal, or fatty acid ratio). Such detailed information is not readily available in busy clinical settings. By contrast, the Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) screener captures similar information to the 24-hour recall with low subject burden without the need for sophisticated computerized software for data collection or analysis. Since dietary advice is based on choices of foods rather than the micronutrients they provide, the micronutrient analysis is not helpful for communication to patients.",0ab22dec-6f97-4a04-a139-176f53217e86
30,discussion2," The simple and intuitive scoring algorithm proposed here can be computed in real time, to enable more focused nutrition counseling sessions or a single overall diet quality score. Furthermore, the screener requires only 4 minutes to complete, far less than a 20-minute recall.  To maximize the usefulness of the Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) for counseling relative to the American Heart Association (AHA) goals listed in Table 1, a second version named Penn Healthy Diet Screener for Dietary Goal Assessment (Penn Healthy Diet (PHD)-G) was created using the same items as the Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) but permitting the identification of daily versus weekly intake of key items (Table 6). This version of the screener requires further validation due to its weekly intake section that was not comparable to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) single day recall data.",f2e3eb92-7e5a-4e39-a0f6-d5d947173f66

The Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) screener is focused on foods typically considered part of an optimal diet according to the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) approach, the Mediterranean diet, and clinical experts, with frequently reported examples from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) surveys.",e8f15d25-887d-4edb-80d6-b5359df654c7
35,discussion7," The Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) scoring algorithm aligns well with Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 scores. The comparison of simulated Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) screener versus Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 components was confirmed in two different but recent groups of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) respondents, and correlations between Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) item scores and Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 scores were not significantly different by self-reported racial/ethnic groups in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), suggesting the representative nature of the items. However, the Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) may not be representative of a healthy diet in individuals consuming a more restricted diet such as vegan or other exclusion diets or with those from groups with very different food cultures.",2aa1756f-d7e2-4210-97aa-ef4a317473f2
36,discussion8," While the use of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) food recall data to identify common food examples gives a degree of national representativeness to the food examples in the screener, the simulated screener responses were inferred from the food recall data and not made by the participants themselves. Therefore, our hypothetical estimate of their response to some questions is likely biased and overly optimistic. To address this issue and evaluate utility of the screener for omics research, a concurrent validation of the Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) with the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour recall (ASA24) is underway in a large sample of patients deeply phenotyped for Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (Non alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)).  Conclusions  In summary, we have developed a new dietary screening tool for use in clinical and potentially in research settings.",2d082436-d3d5-4afd-b4d4-acb1b6e98000
37,discussion9," The Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) screener queries food group exposures in a typical American diet and can be summarized to provide an overall estimate of diet quality that is correlated with Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 estimates derived from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 24-hour recalls. Evaluation of the utility of the Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) screener for research may demonstrate its potential to provide healthy diet information into precision nutrition research. While the present study establishes the utility and scalability of the Penn Healthy Diet (PHD) screener, and provides a simulated assessment of the instrument’s validity, additional research is needed to better establish validity in reference to a gold standard (diet recall) and to further refine a scoring algorithm.
