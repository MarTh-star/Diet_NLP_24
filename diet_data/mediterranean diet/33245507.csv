0,methods0," Isolation of Extracellular Vesicles From Sweet Oranges (Citrus sinensis)  Extracellular vesicles were isolated from sweet oranges of the species Citrus sinensis (CS-EVs). Fresh fruits were purchased from a local producer (certified origin), carefully washed and manually squeezed. The orange juice (350 ml obtained by squeezing approximately four oranges) was mixed with an equal volume of 5% glucose solution and filtered through a paper filter and then through a 0.45-μm membrane filter. To remove residual debris, the juice was finally centrifuged at 800 g for 20 min. To concentrate the juice, the supernatant was ultrafiltered by Vivaflow 200 cell (Sartorius) and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 g for 3 h. The pellet obtained after the ultracentrifugation was washed one time with PBS and ultracentrifuged for additional 3 h. The washed pellet was resuspended in PBS, and protein content was determined by Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo) according to the manufacturer's protocol.",5bac48c2-8cfa-4bdd-8aca-1d5dac780252
1,methods1," CS-EVs were finally stored at −20°C until use.  Extracellular Vesicles (CS-EVs) Identification by Dynamic Light Scattering (Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS))  Dynamic light scattering was employed to identify extracellular vesicles contained in the sample. The size distribution of CS-EVs was determined after diluting the vesicle samples with PBS to avoid possible aggregation between the particles by employing a Nano Zetasizer apparatus equipped with a 5 mW HeNe laser (Malvern Instruments LTD, UK). This system uses backscatter detection, i.e., the scattered light is collected at 173°. To obtain the size distribution, the measured autocorrelation functions were analyzed by means of the CONTIN algorithm (26).",ed4be176-a215-4423-bf05-2a41e1be5924
2,methods2," Decay times are used to determine the distribution of the diffusion coefficients D0 of the particles, which, in turn, can be converted in a distribution of apparent hydrodynamic diameter, Dh, using the Stokes-Einstein relationship Dh = kBT/3πηD0, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, and η the solvent viscosity. The values of the radii shown in this work correspond to the average values on several measurements and are obtained from intensity-weighted distributions (26).  Extracellular Vesicles Characterization by Transmission Electron Microscopy (Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM))  Transmission electron microscopy was employed to characterize the morphology of CS-EVs. All of the Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) measurements have been performed by depositing 20 μl of suspension of vesicles on a 300-mesh copper grid for electron microscopy covered by a thin amorphous carbon film. Samples have been deposited at room temperature.",36df4c5e-088c-4df1-b194-0bb7ec11e1f1
3,methods3," Negative staining was realized by addition of 10 μl of 2% aqueous phosphotungstic acid (phosphotungstic acid (PTA)) solution (the pH was adjusted to 7.3 using 1-M NaOH).

Assessment of Extracellular Vesicles Stability in Simulated Gastric Environment  The evaluation of CS-EVs stability in the gastrointestinal tract was carried out by incubating vesicles (100 μl) with three different solutions that mimic the gastric and the intestinal environment. For the simulation of the gastric solution (GS), pepsin (3 g/L) (from porcine stomach mucosa, Sigma-Aldrich) and lipase (0.9 mg/L) (lipase G from Peniciliumcamemberti, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBSat pH = 2–2.5 were mixed with CS-EVs.",390f1428-c952-4d07-857e-bb39325ae857
4,methods4," After the measurements in GS, small aliquots of an alkaline solution (150 ml of 1MNaOH and 14 g of NaH2PO4·2H2O in 1 L of distilled water) were added to increase the pH value. To mimic the environment of the first intestinal tract (EP1, enteric phase 1), bile (100 mg/ml) (bovine bile, Sigma-Aldrich) and pancreatin (10 mg/ml) (from porcine pancreas, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in PBS, and pH was adjusted to 5.4–5.7. The solution for the second intestinal tract (EP2, enteric phase 2) was prepared starting from EP1 and adjusting the pH to 6.8–7.2 with the same alkaline buffer employed to prepare EP1. After 2-h incubation, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) was employed to monitor vesicles dimension and evaluate aggregation and degradation.",21cb06ad-6e3d-4b09-b3b5-f096ffc9107f
5,methods5,"  Cell Culture Model  The human colonic epithelial cell line CaCo-2 was cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified MEM) High Glucose (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum (FBS)) (HyCloneFoetal calf serum), 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% pyruvate sodium. Cell culture was incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were routinely subcultured one time a week with Trypsin-EDTA solution and seeded at density of 4.5 × 103 cells/cm2 to reach 50% confluence on Day 4 (~5.5 × 104 cells/cm2). For differentiated CaCo-2 cells, the epithelial cells are seeded on filter cell culture chamber inserts (Transwell with polycarbonate filters and 0.4-um filter dimension, Greiner Bio-One) at a density of 3 × 105 cells/cm2. This seeding density allowed to reach confluence within 48 h.",c2a39837-22bd-4eac-9744-1ef451df55e9
6,methods6," When confluence was reached, we employed a cell culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for BL (basal) and without fetal bovine serum (FBS) for AP (apical) compartments. The medium was changed three times a week. A full differentiation is generally observed after 21 days after cell seeding. To assess the differentiation process, we monitored the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (trans epithelial electrical resistance (TEER)) with a Millicell ERS-2 Volt-Ohm meter (Millipore) equipped with a special electrode having the measuring tips covered by a silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) pellet on each electrode tip. In our conditions, values higher than 1,200 Ohm·cm2 corresponded to complete differentiation.

After incubation, the medium was removed and the cells were thoroughly rinsed with PBS. The cells were incubated with 50 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml) for 2 h until a purple precipitate was viewed. Then, the solution was replaced with 50-μl dimethyl sulfoxide (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) in each well prior to spectrophotometric measurements at 570 nm. Means and standard deviations generated from three independent experiments were reported as percentage of viable cells vs. control (untreated) cells.

8,methods8," To visualize CS-EVs, after isolation performed as described above, vesicles were labeled with Alexa Fluor™ 647 N hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (NHS) Ester (ThermoFisher). Briefly, the N hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (NHS)-modified dye was solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml, and 3 μl was added to 100 μl of CS-EVs (200 μg) in PBS/0.1-M NaHCO3 (pH 8.3) (100 μl). Vesicles were incubated with the dye at room temperature for 1 h. Labeled vesicles were purified by a filter column (Centrifugal Filter Units-Amicon Ultra, 10000 NMWL), washed three times with sterile water, and, finally, suspended in sterile PBS. Undifferentiated and differentiated CaCo-2 cells were treated with 5 μg/ml of Alexa-labeled CS-EVs for 6 and 24 h at 37°C.

RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR)  CaCo-2 cells were seeded into 24-transwell inserts and grown up to differentiation. The trans-epithelial electrical resistance (trans epithelial electrical resistance (TEER)) was monitored periodically by using a Millicell ERS-2 apparatus (Millipore).

12,methods12," The cells were stimulated with a cocktail of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ) at two time points (6 and 24 h). TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ were applied to the basolateral compartment at a concentration of 10 ng/ml each. After treatment, the cells were collected, and total RNA was extracted by the Total RNA Purification Plus Kit (Norgen, Biotechnologies Co., Canada), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Total RNA (1 μg) was reversely transcribed to cDNA using the SuperScript III Reverse Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 20 μl following the recommendations of the manufacturer. cDNA samples were amplified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) by using the SensiFAST Probe Lo-ROX master mix (Bioline) and specific Taqman primers (IDT Technologies) for human IL-6, ICAM-1, HMOX-1, MAPK-1, CLDN-1-4, Occludin Protein (OCLN), TJP1, GJB3, REG3G, SRC, CTSB, MYLK, and TLR8.

14,results0," Sweet Orange (Citrus sinensis) Juice Contains Extracellular Vesicles (CS-EVs)  Citrus sinensis extracellular vesicles were isolated from the orange juice by performing several filtration, ultrafiltration, and ultracentrifugation steps by following a procedure that greatly improved the recovery of vesicles (27). In fact, starting from only 350 ml of initial orange juice, we obtained preparations of CS-EVs with a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The procedure that we optimized had some advantages: the ultrafiltration procedure allowed us to concentrate the initial solution up to 40–50 ml, whereas the ultracentrifugation step allowed us to recover visible pellets further purified by several washing steps. By following this protocol, we obtained a uniform and purified preparation of CS-EVs.",d5c48ee3-0c82-44be-ab31-fd64a8b7a03f
15,results1," The diffused light intensity graph of CS-EVs sample obtained by dynamic light scattering (Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)) showed a bimodal distribution, indicative of two different vesicle populations (Figure 1). The diameter of the smallest population was 62 ± 12 nm, whereas the biggest vesicles measured 247 ± 61 nm (Figure 1A). Since the intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the sixth power of the diameter, even small traces of larger objects give a high contribution to the intensity compared to smaller particles. To have a closer look at the morphology of these vesicles, we performed a Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis that confirmed the presence of vesicular structures. In particular, we confirmed not only that the size of observed vesicles was comparable to that obtained by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) data (Figure 1B), but that these vesicles tend to aggregate and form larger particles (white arrows in Figure 1B).",aa1fd524-eeb3-4b29-95f7-d1c5c15dc247
16,results2," These data suggested that the size distribution observed by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) can be the consequence of the aggregation of small particles. Moreover, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis suggested that CS-EVs have the right dimension and morphology to be classified as “exosome-like” extracellular vesicles.

17,results3,"  CS-EVs Are Stable in in vitro Models That Mimic the Gastrointestinal Tract  Our hypothesis is that CS-EVs may have a beneficial effect when they come in contact with the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, translocate into them, and, eventually, deliver their cargo (i.e., nucleic acids and proteins). However, to have an effect in vivo, CS-EVs should pass intact the gastrointestinal tract and remain unaltered to the extreme environmental conditions (i.e., low pH, presence of proteolytic enzymes, etc.). Therefore, to assess whether CS-EVs are stable in all the gastrointestinal tract, we prepared three different aqueous solutions, with a composition resembling that of the three main gastrointestinal tracts (i.e., stomach, duodenum, and colon). These solutions (i.e., GS, EP1, and EP2, respectively) were then used to incubate CS-EVs for 2 h. Size distribution of vesicles was recorded at the end of the incubation for each solution.",bb02230d-4794-48fe-beb6-fc0849dc267c
18,results4," Figure 1C shows that CS-EVs incubated in the gastric solution (GS) maintained their initial dimension (from 61 ± 8 to 64 ± 9 nm, p > 0.05 and from 873 ± 207 to 852 ± 193 nm, p > 0.05). Similarly, not statistically significant results were also obtained for the remaining two enteric phase solutions during the 2-h incubation period. The sequential incubation of CS-EVs in the enteric phase 1 (EP1) solution showed a significant dimensional increase of the smaller population compared with the gastric solution (from 63 ± 9 to 98 ± 29 nm, p < 0.05), whereas the difference between EP1 and EP2 (from 98 ± 29 to 108 ± 30 nm) was not statistically significant (Figure 1C). The larger population did not display significant dimensional differences in the three solutions. Overall, we can emphasize that CS-EVs are dimensionally stable when incubated in GS, EP1, and EP2 but slightly increase their dimension when they are incubated in EP1/EP2 compared with GS.",58b05224-355d-41aa-b72d-e99fe49dcb78
19,results5,"  CS-EVs Are Not Cytotoxic and Are Easily Internalized by Intestinal Cells  To assess whether CS-EVs have cytotoxic effects on epithelial cells, confluent CaCo-2 cells were treated with vesicles at increasing concentrations (from 5 to 20 μg/ml). The MTT viability assay showed that the treatment with 5, 10, or 20 μg/ml of CS-EVs did not alter significantly the cell viability compared with untreated cells (Figure 2).  Figure 2 CaCo-2 cells viability after CS-EVs treatment. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay at 24, 48, and 72 h after incubation with 5, 10, or 20 μg/ml of CS-EVs. Each histogram represents the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.  Therefore, to determine the ability of human epithelial cells to internalize CS-EVs, we conjugated CS-EVs with the Alexa Fluor™ 647 dye (Figure 3) to monitor their cellular fate. CaCo-2 cells were grown up to confluence and treated with labeled CS-EVs for 6 h (Figure 4B).",50e9cf5c-8990-4afe-80d4-a7892ef54d24
20,results6," Undifferentiated CaCo-2 cells formed multiple layers, and many intra-layer spaces were observed by confocal microscopy (Figures 4A,B). The movie reconstructed from the images (Supplementary File 1) showed that CS-EVs were able to penetrate deeply through the cavities formed by multiple cell layers. As expected, the small dimension of CS-EVs facilitates their diffusion and the further internalization into cells. In fact, to assess this latter aspect, we employed also differentiated CaCo-2 cells (i.e., epithelial cells) that grow mainly as a monolayer. We observed that, after 6 h of incubation with CS-EVs, the differentiated cells presented only a small amount of vesicles within the cytoplasm, whereas, after 24 h, we observed a higher internalization compared to untreated control cells (Figures 4A,B). This time-dependent internalization has been observed also for the undifferentiated CaCo-2 cells (Figures 4D,E), and this process was complete after 24 h.",c9b1e93f-26f7-4f0a-9491-65149f8e75df

CS-EVs Reduce the Expression of Inflammatory Genes and Enhance That of Permeability-Related Genes  In the light of using CS-EVs as candidate natural modulators of biological processes related to pro-inflammatory processes or the tightening of intestinal intracellular junctions (i.e., tight junction proteins) that may determine an unbalanced homeostasis and the onset of different gastrointestinal diseases, we investigated the effects of CS-EVs on the gene expression of differentiated CaCo-2 cells as a model of the normal intestinal epithelium (Figure 5). In particular, we focused on the evaluation of tight junction genes (i.e., CLDN-1, CLDN-4, GJB3, Occludin Protein (OCLN), and ZO-1), inflammatory and immune response genes (i.e., IL-6, ICAM-1, MAPK-1, and TLR8), and other defense mechanism genes (i.e.",e6439690-8384-4b09-a1de-7369e90d975d

Out of the analyzed genes, only CLDN1, Occludin Protein (OCLN), myosin L chain (MLC)K, HMOX-1, and ICAM1 resulted significantly dysregulated at 4 h (Figure 5A) and 24 h (Figure 5B) after the treatment.",e71882c1-29f1-41c9-9767-652e794e3607
24,results10," As reported in Figure 5, the pretreatment of CaCo-2 cells with CS-EVs did not generally induce a marked increase of the expression of the considered genes, suggesting that the effect of CS-EVs is negligible. On the contrary, the inflammatory stimulus induced a significant increase of gene expression both at 6 and 24 h compared to controls (Figure 5C). ICAM1 increased its expression more than 12 times at 6 h and remained high up to 24 h. The expression of CLDN1, HMOX-1, and Occludin Protein (OCLN) increased, whereas that of myosin L chain (MLC)K decreased.  Interestingly, the presence of CS-EVs inhibited the upregulation of ICAM1 or HMOX-1 by the stimulus, suggesting that these vesicles may have a protective role in the inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways activation (Figure 5C). Similarly, the upregulation of CLDN-1 and Occludin Protein (OCLN) that are both involved in tight junction formation has been increased since the beginning (6 h).",fee294a3-a19a-4214-b74c-8c7724de846c
25,results11," This suggests that CS-EVs activate rapidly the formation of cell-cell junctions that generally counteract the disruption of the barrier integrity induced by the inflammatory cocktail. Similar conclusions can be drawn for myosin L chain (MLC)K at 24 h, whereas, at 4 h, both the inflammatory stimulus and the combined treatment with CS-EVs led to a downregulation of this gene.  CS-EVs Counteract the Occludin Protein (Occludin Protein (OCLN)) Cytoplasmic Distribution After Stimulation With the Cytokine Cocktail  To assess the counteracting effect of CS-EVs on the inflammatory stimulus by the cytokine cocktail, we studied the localization of the occludin protein Occludin Protein (OCLN) (Figure 6). To this aim, CaCo-2 cells were cultured and differentiated, pretreated, and stimulated as already described above.

27,results13," The confocal images confirmed that the pretreatment with CV-EVs did not alter the cell morphology (Figures 6A,B), the localization of Occludin Protein (OCLN) or the amount or the protein (Figure 6G). On the contrary, the stimulation of epithelial cells with the cytokine cocktail (with or without the pretreatment with CS-EVs) impaired its localization (Figures 6C,D) and increased the amount of occludin (Figure 6G) compared with control cells. Moreover, the localization of the occludin protein in epithelial cells pretreated with CS-EVs (stimulated with the cocktail) resulted distributed mainly to the cell membrane (Figure 6D and magnification in Figure 6F), and this difference is statistically significant compared with cells that were not pretreated with CS-EVs (Figure 6C and magnification in Figure 6E).",9b571553-287e-434f-8bf9-18f2c98c7843
28,results14," Finally, also, the transepithelial electrical resistance (trans epithelial electrical resistance (TEER)) measurements (Figure 6H) indicates that the pretreatment with CS-EVs is able to increase significantly the trans epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), compared with the untreated epithelial cells. This finding is in agreement with previous observations that indicate that CS-EVs are able to increase the intercellular junctions and support once more the beneficial effects of these fruit vesicles.

29,discussion0," In the last few years, a growing interest was focused on the discovery of nanovesicles from edible plants, such as fruits and vegetables (19, 28, 29). The deep characterization of these vesicles revealed the presence of bioactive molecules (i.e., nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small RNAs), just like the mammalian exosomes. Since exosomes have been widely recognized to act as messengers between different kinds of cells or organs since their first discovery (30), it appears clear that it is the potential interest in extracellular vesicles of vegetal origin as modulators of important physiological pathways. Moreover, extracellular vesicles derived from different species of plants have different biological effects on the recipient mammalian cells (9, 28, 31), suggesting a potential inter-kingdom communication, although a complete understanding of these mechanisms requires further explorations.

30,discussion1," have demonstrated that grape vesicles are taken up by mouse intestinal macrophages, inducing an antioxidant genes expression and the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (9). Despite these few studies, little is known about vesicles from edible foods (i.e., fruits of the Mediterranean diet such as oranges) consumed in our daily diet. Moreover, their functional role in cross-kingdom interaction must be further explored. In our work, we isolated extracellular vesicles from the fresh orange of the Citrus sinensis species (variety Tarocco) highly consumed in the Mediterranean area. The daily consumption of orange juice is usually associated with an improved diet quality and a beneficial health effect (32, 33).  Our results showed that extracellular vesicles are abundant in the fresh juice, and the biophysical characterization demonstrated that CS-EVs are dimensionally homogeneous (~70 nm in diameter).",07483e9b-9e8b-4c0c-8147-e9da18578fe2
31,discussion2," Furthermore, we simulated the environment of the gastrointestinal tract in vitro by the use of proper solutions to see if CS-EVs are stable and viable after the pH change of the gastrointestinal tract. We showed that there are no significant variations in the size of CS-EVs after 2 h from the initial incubation, outlining the great stability of the vesicles in these conditions. We noticed only a slight increase in vesicles dimension during the passage through the different solutions, maybe attributable to an increase of the pH values that may lead to a different charge polarization (i.e., neutralization) of the EVs membranes. However, our in vitro data demonstrated that CS-EVs can reach the lower gastrointestinal tract with their intact cargo. This result confirms that CS-EVs can be considered stable carriers through all of the gastrointestinal tract and potentially employed as useful and innovative biocarriers.",bcdcf512-2554-4a5a-9908-9faf77a8d54d
32,discussion3,"  The hypothesis we wanted to demonstrate was that the ingestion of CS-EVs can be absorbed/internalized by the intestinal epithelial cells and exploit a “beneficial” effect (i.e., antioxidant effects or the restoring of increased intestinal permeability). In humans, the damaged intestinal epithelium (i.e., leaky gut) is the source of many metabolic and chronic diseases (34, 35). Therefore, the prevention of these damages or their restoration could be beneficial and ultimately lead to a healthier lifestyle.  To investigate these effects on a human intestinal epithelium, we employed CaCo-2 cells that are able to spontaneously form a differentiated cell monolayer after culturing them for 21 days. We employed also a model of overgrown undifferentiated cells that are able to form multilayers in order to investigate the ability of CS-EVs to pass through intercellular spaces.",e39b9969-4521-477a-bd10-680732057652
33,discussion4," To visualize CS-EVs, we functionalized the amino groups located on their membrane surface with an efficient Alexa fluorescent dye by exploiting an N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (N hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (NHS)) conjugation (Figure 3).  Compared with other traditional dyes used for EVs labeling, Alexa Fluor 647 presents several advantages: (1) the intrinsic brightness of this marker allows optimal setting parameters for confocal microscopy and can be easily detected due to its high extinction coefficient; (2) this dye, owing to its simple chemical structure, cannot form micelles or other aggregates that can fluoresce under the microscope and cause false positive results in EVs uptake experiments, owing to an increase in the EVs size, and this is an advantage over PKH26 dye (36). This bioconjugation reaction allowed us to obtain an original compound, possessing a stable labeling moiety that we reported here for the first time.",7c51eb82-dd2b-4788-a67c-45fcceeb9a3d
34,discussion5," This easy and cheap protocol can be also used for many other purposes in the field of EVs.  As expected, we confirmed that CS-EVs were not toxic to intestinal epithelial cells and that they are able to enter into cells just after 6 h of incubation. We found that the internalization of CS-EVs into intestinal epithelial cells is able to modulate the expression of important genes related to inflammatory pathways, such as HMOX-1 and ICAM1, or to the restoration of intestinal permeability related such as claudins and occludin. Although the number of analyzed genes/pathways was quite limited to unravel all the possible interactions and mechanisms induced by CS-EVs, from the results we obtained, we can strongly suggest that CS-EVs may exert a beneficial effect on human cells and, in particular, intestinal cells.",d3dfdfc0-30db-42c6-ac0d-7c092fb32fbc
35,discussion6," The effects we observed are related to the restoration of tight junctions or to the inhibition of inflammatory genes, but we can hypothesize that these effects are not limited only to those genes and biological pathways. A recent review paper summarized and provided robust evidence, favoring the anti-IBD effects of citrus fruits and their flavonoids in the prevention and treatment of IBD (37).  Although we know that the results obtained in this work are preliminary to more detailed investigations, we foresee that the comprehension of the potentialities of CS-EVs should include also the characterization of their protein and RNA content, a goal that we will continue investigating.  Finally, although partial and focused only on vegetal extracellular vesicles, our data confirm the larger concept that the effects of eating food (with all of its components) belonging to the Mediterranean diet are beneficial to human health.",17776e87-5654-4e5d-a062-f1987bd22149
