0,background0,"The progressive aging of the population calls for the launch of programs aimed at achieving healthy aging so that people can maintain their autonomy for as long as possible. Active aging is defined by the WHO as “the process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation and security, in order to enhance the quality of life as people age” [1], which could be achieved through interventions or health promotion and prevention programs which include innovative and cost-effective strategies, such as the use of various digital health technologies [2].  New technologies and strategies to help older adults modify their lifestyles Mobile health, or mHealth, is a fundamental support tool for clinical practice and in particular for information gathering and communication between health care professionals and patients.",ce4ef843-f5da-4876-bbdd-c60398f7bb1a
1,background1," Mhealth includes the use of mobile phones, patient monitoring devices and other wireless devices, and is used for both the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases and the promotion of healthy lifestyles [3–5]. One of the most recent reviews on this topic indicates that interventions using smartphones have managed to improve physical activity and adiposity markers, obtaining greater effectiveness by combining these interventions with individualized counseling [6]. Although the adoption of digital technology related to health among the elderly has been slow, this trend is being modified by the development of easier-to-use devices [7, 8]. It is estimated that 60% of older adults regularly use the Internet and 18% have a smartphone, computer or tablet [8]. In addition, 30% regularly search for health information online [7].",2840e631-367a-4ce5-a1d9-979d042d0cd9
2,background2," The routine integration of digital technology into the health management strategies of older people will increase as people become more digitally experienced [9]. In an intervention based on the use of pedometers carried out among the adult population which included people up to 75 years of age [10], the number of steps rose by approximately one-tenth and walking intensity was also increased. However, it has not been investigated whether the effect on behavioral changes among people over the age of 60 could be greater if multiple lifestyle changes were addressed at the same time.  New technologies and strategies to help older adults reduce weight and modify body composition Obesity affects more than 35% of people over 65 in developed countries, with figures doubling over the last 30 years [11] alongside increasing morbidity and mortality [12–15].",cff4ac3e-f049-46ef-9366-6cf0740dffb5
3,background3," In addition, weight gain in this age group mainly involves an increase in adipose tissue, which is responsible for the complications associated with obesity [16, 17] and a decrease in muscle mass, leading to greater functional disability [18–20]. Action on obesity in the ≥65 s should take into account associated comorbidity and functional limitations [16, 21, 22]. The different strategies aimed at weight loss for older subjects have obtained controversial results [16, 17]. In most of the interventions performed in this age group, weight loss is associated with an increase in the loss of muscle and bone mass. [16, 23]. It is thus necessary to seek a balance, minimizing the negative effects while pursuing the advantages of reducing excess body weight [23]. Interventions involving new technologies have been carried out mostly among young people and the adult population, with very few involving subjects ≥65.",9476a5a4-5d37-41f6-9da2-06f831135bca
4,background4," In general, these interventions have yielded positive results, as reflected in several meta-analyses [6, 24–26] and numerous clinical trials [27–32]. On the other hand, most studies used small samples and did not assess whether weight loss was obtained at the expense of fat mass or lean mass.  New technologies to help older adults improve quality of life and daily living activities One of the goals of mHealth is to involve patients in the design and implementation of strategies to improve health and increase the general quality of life [33]. Health is closely linked to quality of life aspects, such as psychological well-being, autonomy, mobility, safety and social participation [34]. In turn, these aspects are affected by personal and environmental factors [35] which are conditioned by the state of health and which usually worsen with age [36].",92466b94-317c-44fa-b5cd-e1ae4b42567c
5,background5," Older people are interested in finding out about applications that could be useful in the realization of their daily activities [37], which suggests that such tools may help them in adapting to the environment and enable them to carry out daily living activities. Independence is imperative for older adults in order to avoid social exclusion [38], and in terms of control and choice, it is also of great importance when they access health services via mobile applications. Therefore, this type of device appears to perform an important service by promoting mobility and autonomy among older adults, which in turn can positively affect their quality of life [39].  New technologies to help older adults improve cognitive performance Increasing longevity has led to a growing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases and ensuing cognitive deterioration and dementia. Recent studies suggest that maintaining a healthy lifestyle is associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment [40, 41].",6b4916f8-927e-46dd-b9b4-d114f05f7b85
6,background6," Indeed, it appears that maintaining certain eating patterns and healthy lifestyles, such as physical activity, could prevent it [42]. Thus, interventions focused on increasing physical activity and adherence to the Mediterranean diet, separately and in combination, not only reduce the risk of cognitive decline, but are also able to improve cognitive performance in healthy older people [43, 44]. Moreover, interest in the effect that the use of mHealth and new technologies in particular can have on cognitive performance is growing. Although more studies are needed in this area, existing results are promising. It has been proved that specific physical exercise interventions using mobile applications have beneficial health effects for healthy older adults and even patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia; it has also been shown that they have no difficulty in adapting to the use of these new technologies [45, 46].",533331dd-4552-4fdb-80e0-68dec8033d71
7,background7,"  The use of electronic devices and smartphones by the older population has grown significantly, a fact which increases the potential for their use to improve different aspects of health for this age group. Most studies so far have been carried out with the young adult or middle-aged population; thus, despite their potential, the usefulness of new technologies has been little studied in older adults. There are some pilot studies noting the combined effect of these technologies alongside professional advice in lifestyle improvement, but the size of these studies does not adequately substantiate this relationship and its relevance in clinical terms. Results of the EVIDENT II study [47], which was carried out with adults, show that an intervention combining standardized counseling on diet and PA with the use of an app which incorporates personalized recommendations achieves beneficial results in terms of modifying anthropometric measurements among women.",129dee32-c164-486b-b023-faeb1f273d57
8,background8," These results include a reduction in visceral adiposity. In addition, other studies have provided promising results in improving cognitive performance when maintaining a healthy lifestyle, even in people with mild cognitive impairment. All this may have a far-reaching impact on the quality of life and reduce cardiovascular risk factors.  Hypothesis and objective The main hypothesis of the EVIDENT-Age study is that lifestyle improvements among the over-65 population, achieved through the combined use of smartphones and smartbands, could have an influence in terms of improving body composition, quality of life, daily living activities and cognitive performance.  The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the combined use of smartphone and smartband technology for 3 months alongside brief counseling on life habits, versus counseling alone, in increasing physical activity and improving adherence to the Mediterranean diet.",9c2ea1c3-21eb-4a18-bc10-501a78758f6d
9,background9," As a secondary objective, we will assess the effect of the intervention on body composition, quality of life, daily living activities and cognitive performance.  Methods/design Trial design This study is a controlled and randomized parallel-group clinical trial, to be carried out in three health centers of the community of Castilla y León in Spain (La Alamedilla Health Centre, Garrido Sur Health Centre and Miguel Armijo Health Centre). The study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03574480. Date of trial Registration July 2, 2018. The study was designed in accordance with the SPIRIT guidelines [48].

This device also calculates the total time spent daily in light, moderate and intense physical activity and the kilocalories used. Validated GT3X accelerometers will be used [53]. Participants will wear the accelerometer strapped to the right side of their waist with an elastic belt for seven consecutive days. Data will be recorded minute by minute. If the accelerometer records 10 consecutive zeros over the course of 10 min, the measurement will be considered null. The intensity of physical activity (low, moderate or high) will be determined according to the cut points proposed by Freedson [54].",db0b008a-8cbe-4703-8e4d-52aebbedea98

The short version will be used, which is validated in Spanish and assesses physical activity over the last 7 days [55]. This questionnaire classifies adult populations by their level of activity (low, moderate and high) and differentiates three types of activity: walking, moderate activity and vigorous activity. The physical activity dose will be estimated in METs/minute/week. An active person is considered to be someone who performs at least 30 min of moderate activity, five days a week, or at least 20 min of vigorous activity, three days a week, or reaches 450 METs/minute/week.

The questionnaire differentiates between work and non-work days.  Dietary pattern The change in adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) will be measured by the total scores (baseline and final) on the Mediterranean diet adherence questionnaire. This questionnaire, validated in Spain, has been used in the PREDIMED study [57] and asks 14 questions regarding MD compliance. Each question is scored with zero or one point. One point is given for using olive oil as the main fat for cooking, preferring white meat to red meat, daily consumption of four or more tablespoons (one tablespoon = 13.5 g) of olive oil (including oil used for frying, dressing salads, etc.",0c8f65b9-3d1b-4654-954e-b9259be4b3c5

Cognitive performance General cognitive capacity will be assessed by applying the Spanish validation of the Mini-Mental State Examination (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) [59]. This test allows the performance of different cognitive functions to be tracked: temporo-spatial orientation, attention, learning and memory, executive functions, language and visuoconstructive skills. The score can range from 0 to 30 points, with greater than 24 points considered to represent normal cognitive performance. In addition, the clock test will be applied [60] to assess visuoconstructive skills, executive functions and language.

In addition, the researcher responsible for the statistical analysis will not know the group to which the participants belong. To prevent contamination between groups, no additional counseling or reinforcement will be made during the 3-month evaluation visit. In addition, the app will not be available for download until the study is completed.
