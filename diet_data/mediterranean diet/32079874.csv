0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design This study involved 43 incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3b to 4 patients who were willing to continue the prospective, randomized, crossover-controlled trial [16] by undergoing the third arm of the diet, namely MD + KA. The complete study design is reported in Scheme 1. The study was carried out in accord to the Declaration of Helsinki (IV Adaptation) and all participants signed the informed consent at inclusion. The study protocol was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier number NCT02302287 and approved by the local institutional Ethical Review Board (Campania Nord Ethics Committee, Avellino, Italy. Code Number: CECN/296). Patients’ recruitment inclusion criteria, detailed diets, primary and secondary end points, medical visits, and NT adherence have been reported in our previous works [8,16]. Software randomization split chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients into 2 treatment groups (A, B), with a 1:1 ratio as reported in Scheme 1.",c16d47d5-382a-47f7-82d5-9d867d7b11d6
1,methods1,"  The different dietary regimes (Table 1) have already been fully described previously [8,16], with the exception of the new third arm, MD + KA, which implies the oral administration of one tablet of essential amino acids (285 mg/kg of body weight) and ketoanalogs (323 mg/kg of body weight) (ALFA-KAPPA, Fresenius Kabi) [17] for every 5 kg of the patient’s ideal body weight, provided at breakfast, lunch, and dinner in patients following the Mediterranean diet (Table 1).   To avoid any potential carry-over effect of the diet regimens (MD, very low protein diet (VLPD), and MD + KA) a washout period of free diet (FD) (three months) followed each cross-over timing. Biological samples (sera, stools, and urine) from each patient were collected at the time of recruitment (T0), and after three (T3), nine (T9), twelve (T12), eighteen (T18), twenty-one (T21), and twenty-seven (T27) months; times at which medical examinations were also carried out.   2.2.",324d08ae-095b-4ba5-b9ae-a232b3a399a0
2,methods2," Collection of Serum and Fecal Samples Blood and fecal samples were collected and processed as described [16].   2.3. Reagents All reagents used have been previously described [16].  2.4. LC-MS/MS for Quantification of p cresyl sulfate (PCS) and IS Indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate serum levels have been analyzed for all 43 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients at the end of three months of FD (wash-out period, baseline) and at the end of each diet regimen. A total of four measures were registered for each patient. Total and free IS and p cresyl sulfate (PCS) were measured by multiple-reaction-monitoring mass spectrometry analysis as described in our previous work [16,18].  2.5. Serum D-Lactate Assay D-lactate serum levels were analyzed in all 43 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients at the different time points as described [16].   2.6.",37e1c5c6-e594-4936-ae1b-5303fa19f5e8
3,methods3," RNA Extraction from Fecal Samples and 16S cDNA Sequencing Total RNA was extracted from all fecal samples, transcribed to cDNA, and analyzed by NGS (Illumina MiSeq desktop sequencer) as described previously [16].  2.7. Statistics No sample size estimation was carried out because no data were present in current literature on the effects of diets. Variables were reported as appropriate: mean ± standard deviation (SD), median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)), or count (percentage). Differences occurring among the different dietary regimens were assessed by Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. All analyses were conducted as intention-to-treat. Two-tailed probability values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses were completed using R version 3.1.3 (2015-03-09) (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). For linear regression analysis, the Statview software package SAS 5.0 version was used.",d707155c-4460-498e-aeb5-5b12d0771fa2
4,methods4," Data obtained by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) based on Unifrac distance metric and taxonomic abundance [19,20] using the statistical software Statistica for Windows (Statistica 6.0 for Windows 1998, StatSoft, Vigonza, Italia). Measures of diversity were screened for group differences by the use of ANOVA. In order to identify clusters among samples (dietary interventions) and variables (bacterial taxa) the Permut-MatrixEN software was also used [21]. Multivariable association between 16S rRNA data abundances at different taxonomic levels and dietary features was performed using the MaAsLin2 R package (https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/maaslin/ (doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.20.427420; accessed on 20 January 2021)). In order to obtain correlation scores between operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and metabolite concentration, a Spearman correlation analysis was applied.",002491d5-b3ae-45eb-b5ba-19bae443f89b
5,methods5," The R- analyses were performed using the vegan, labdsv, DESeq2, and phyloseq packages.  3. Results 3.1. Patients All chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients completed the trial. Table 2 shows the list of demographic, biochemical, and clinical data of all 43 patients in accordance with each nutritional regimen. In comparison with MD, KA-supplemented MD increased diastolic blood pressure, decreased HbA1c, increased triglycerides and transferrin, and decreased creatinine clearance.   Differently, very low protein diet (VLPD) lowered both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the serum creatinine, urea, sodium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, proteinuria, and C reactive protein more effectively than MD or KA-supplemented MD.",5cfecb62-0c73-49dd-b905-7f354baa63d0
6,methods6," At serum level, very low protein diet (VLPD) was associated with increased bicarbonate and eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), while at urine level very low protein diet (VLPD) was associated with increased potassium and decreased sodium and phosphate (Table 2). Only very low protein diet (VLPD) lowered the urinary phosphorus excretion and sodium intake according to literature data [8,11,22,23].  3.2. Microbial Components Linked to Specific Dietary Intake The microbial alpha diversity values were not affected by the four different dietary regimens (p > 0.05). Similarly, there was no strict separation concerning microbiota composition in MD, MD + KA, and very low protein diet (VLPD) when performed a principal components analysis (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)). At phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was highest after the very low protein diet (VLPD) (16.37%), significantly when compared to the MD (9.09%; p = 0.03) (Figure 1A).",40a9839b-4b9d-4278-bf07-f05036421f75
7,methods7," Although not significantly, the very low protein diet (VLPD) determined also an increase of Actinobacteria (MD: 5.47%, MD + KA: 6.74%, very low protein diet (VLPD): 8.41%) and a decrease of Firmicutes (MD: 73.93%, MD + KA: 74.37%, very low protein diet (VLPD): 70.93%). The main effect of the very low protein diet (VLPD) was on Proteobacteria abundances, which were strongly reduced compared to other diets (p ≤ 0.022). KA supplementation combined with the MD (MD + KA) determined a decrease of the Euryarchaeota (p = 0.002).   At family level, the very low protein diet (VLPD) affected the amounts of Desulfovibrionaceae (0.12%), Enterobacteriaceae (0.53%), both families of Proteobacteria, and Streptococcaceae (Firmicutes), determining the lowest relative abundances (p ≤ 0.039; Figure 1B). Compared to MD + KA, also Enterococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Veillonellaceae decreased in the very low protein diet (VLPD) (p ≤ 0.031).",31e7abf6-04bc-4eae-be7c-8a7a4eb4d1a6
8,methods8," Conversely, in the very low protein diet (VLPD) was found the highest levels of Ruminococcaceae (11.13%, p ≤ 0.024). Based on the abundances in MD, the KA supplementation in MD + KA seems to decrease levels of Clostridiaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, and Prevotellaceae (p ≤ 0.042). Otherwise, this was not confirmed in very low protein diet (VLPD) where Clostridiaceae and Prevotellaceae increased (p ≤ 0.009). The MD was mainly characterized by high abundances of Lactobacillaceae (15.1%), but the KA supplementation determined their decrease in MD + KA (5.39%; not significant) and particularly in the very low protein diet (VLPD) (0.69%; p = 0.01). Bacteroidaceae were mainly found in both MD + KA (9.87%) and the very low protein diet (VLPD) (9.15%) and reduced in the MD (4.95%; p = 0.006). The taxon that seems to report a direct relationship with KA supplementation was Lachnospiraceae.",6f001f87-d4ec-4cb3-ac37-13c8fc6852d9
9,methods9," This family reported an increased abundance in both the supplemented dietary regimens (MD + KA and VPLD), even if the increase was significantly only comparing the MD to the very low protein diet (VLPD) (p ≤ 0.01).  The Lachnospiraceae modulation associated with the KA supplementation was also observed at genus and species levels; in this line, Blautia (Bl. coccoides), Lachnospira (L. pectinoschiza), and Roseburia (R. faecis) were taxa that reported a marked increase in both KA-supplemented dietary regimens in comparison with the MD (p ≤ 0.029; Figure 2, Table 3). Meanwhile, other OTUs belonging to Lachnospiraceae were mainly harbored by the dietary change in the very low protein diet (VLPD), e.g., Bl. hydrogenotrophica, Bl. obeum, Bl. wexlerae, Coprococcus eutactus, and Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans (Table 3). Oppositely, Dorea (D. formicigenerans) was the only taxon of this family that decreased in the very low protein diet (VLPD) compared to both the MD and MD + KA (p ≤ 0.005).",7ebf3e54-ba8e-40f9-9363-2c004345e4a0
10,methods10," The very low protein diet (VLPD) confirmed the different effect on firmicutes sub-taxa; this dietary regimen mainly decreased lactobacilli abundances (L. fermentum, L. gasseri, L. oris, L. salivarius; p ≤ 0.045) and Streptococcus (S. parasanguinis, S. sobrinus, and S. vestibularis; p ≤ 0.043). Moreover, the very low protein diet (VLPD) also significantly decreased abundances of Enterococcus lactis and Eubacterium biforme compared to the MD + KA (p ≤ 0.024).  Conversely, Firmicutes OTUs harbored by the low protein intake were: Clostridium cadaveris and Sarcina maxima (both Clostridiaceae; p ≤ 0.021), Eggerthella sinensis (p ≤ 0.002), and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p ≤ 0.007). Among Bacteroidetes, only Bacteroides stercoris was strictly influenced by the very low protein diet (VLPD), increasing compared to the MD and MD + KA (p ≤ 0.019). Undoubtedly, the very low protein diet (VLPD) decreased proteobacteria OTUs (in particular Escherichia albertii and Serratia entomophila; p ≤ 0.",9b3ed9f0-2dd3-44bb-9e9b-a670a09b8c00
11,methods11,"033) and increased Bifidobacteriaceae abundances (B. adolescentis and B. stercoris; p ≤ 0.038) compared to both the other dietary regimes (the MD and MD + KA).  3.3. Microbial Pattern Linked to Ketoanalogs Administration In order to determine microbial patterns mainly influenced by the different diets (MD or very low protein diet (VLPD)) and which ones were influenced by the ketoanalog administration, we performed a statistical analysis in MaAsLin2. We analyzed all bacterial abundances based on two associated metadata used as fixed effects: diet, MD (used for both MD and MD + KA) or very low protein diet (VLPD); and ketoanalogs either administered (MD + KA and very low protein diet (VLPD)) or not administered. At phylum level (Figure 3), it was observed that proteobacteria were negatively associated with the very low protein diet (VLPD) (p = 0.023), whereas Euryarchaeota reported a negative association with KA consumption (p = 0.012).",fe125934-ecce-4194-8cf7-950846574bc3
12,methods12," However, both the afore-reported associations were not confirmed for adjusted p-values (q-value > 0.05; Figure 3). Meanwhile, at family level (Table 4) was found a negative association of Streptococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae with the very low protein diet (VLPD) (p ≤ 0.000; q ≤ 0.016), a positive association of Clostridiaceae with the very low protein diet (VLPD) (p < 0.000; q = 0.015), and a positive correlation between Lachnospiraceae and KA consumption (p = 0.002; q = 0.042). Similar results were found also at genus level (Table 4), where Streptococcus, lactobacilli, and Clostridium reported the same trend of the relative families (p < 0.000; q ≤ 0.02). Meanwhile, despite the positive correlation between Lachnospiraceae and KA consumption, Dorea reported a negative correlation based on the very low protein diet (VLPD) dietary regimen (p < 0.000; q = 0.002).  3.4. Uremic Toxins In comparison to FD (IS: 8.65 ± 6.0 μg/mL; 0.3 ± 0.3 μg/mL. p cresyl sulfate (PCS): 25.2 ± 14.4 μg/mL; 1.",d49cb577-fd4c-4c53-a5cb-42ddf0623f78
13,methods14," The total and free IS and p cresyl sulfate (PCS) serum levels of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients after the MD + KA were not significantly lower than those after the MD regimen.  We found a positive correlation between both total and free IS and p cresyl sulfate (PCS) serum levels with azotemia (r = 0.38, p < 0.0001; r = 0.38, p < 0.0001 for total and free IS; r = 0.42, p < 0.0001; r = 0.41, p < 0.0001 for total and free p cresyl sulfate (PCS)). In addition, both total and free IS and p cresyl sulfate (PCS) serum levels showed a positive correlation with protein intake (r = 0.30, p = 0,0002, and r = 0.26, p = 0.001 for total and free IS, respectively; r = 0.40, and r = 0.40, p < 0.0001 for total and free p cresyl sulfate (PCS), respectively) and parathyroid hormone (parathyroid hormone (PTH)) (r = 0.30, p < 0.0001; r = 0.15, p =0.05 for total and free IS, respectively; r = 0.32, p < 0.0001 and r = 0.27, p = 0.",9b7d8729-1a78-48c9-8bf2-cd91d6db0d49
14,methods15,"0006, for total and free p cresyl sulfate (PCS) respectively), while only total IS and p cresyl sulfate (PCS) were weakly negatively correlated with the eGFR values (r = −0.19, p = 0.01; r = −0.17, p = 0.02) of the enrolled patients.   3.5. KA Supplementation Does Not Reduce Intestinal Permeability Compared to the MD  As a marker of intestinal permeability, serum D-lactate levels were measured in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients following the four different dietary regimens (FD, MD, very low protein diet (VLPD), and MD + KA). The very low protein diet (VLPD) is very effective in reducing D-lactate in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients (266.6 uM), in comparison with FD [651.89 uM, p = 0.003] and the MD [590.8 uM, p = 0.01], confirming our previous data [16]. The MD regimen showed a not-significant decrease of D-lactate levels in comparison with FD and KA supplementation does not further reduce them (MD + KA, 533.8.8 uM) (Figure 5).",98cf5dcc-413a-4e15-a039-43d2d1cf18d0
15,methods16," We found that D-lactate levels were positively correlated with blood urea nitrogen levels (r = 0.3, p = 0.002).   3.6. Correlations between Dietary Intake and Metabolome with Microbiome  There was a positive relationship between fecal microbiota and azotemia (Figure S1). Lactobacilli and Streptococcus were positively correlated (r = 0.44, FDR = 0.02; r = 0.40, FDR = 0.03, respectively) with azotemia. Streptococcus was also positively associated with the urinary phosphorus excretion (FeP) (r = 0.41, FDR = 0.03). Faecalibacterium was negatively associated with systolic blood pressure (r = −0.49, FDR = 0.03). Among protein-bound uremic toxins, free IS was found to be negatively associated with Roseburia (r = −0.49, FDR = 0.03) (Figure S1).  4. Discussion As we have recently proved [16], nutritional therapy represents an effective strategy to modify the gut microbiome and to lower the serum levels of protein-bound uremic toxins in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.",fb4657ca-1260-4cb6-b11b-8f4832cd3d3b
16,methods17," Indeed, the Mediterranean diet and, to a greater extent, the very low protein diet (VLPD) have proven to be effective in beneficially modulating gut microbiota, reducing IS and p cresyl sulfate (PCS) serum levels, and intestinal permeability in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients [16]. The aim of the current trial was to investigate the effects of the ketoanalogs (KA) on microbiome modulation, uremic toxins levels, and intestinal permeability. KA are precursors of the corresponding amino acids, in which they are converted by transamination, a chemical reaction that transfers an amino group from urea to a ketoacid to form the amino acid. This reaction allows the consumption of the available nitrogen in excess, a condition often occurring in chronic kidney impairment, consequently lowering urea concentration [1].",bf4b8255-2100-4eab-9199-e635df97d082
17,methods18," Moreover, in order to maintain a good nutritional status despite the reduced protein intake that is a feature of the very low protein diet (VLPD), essential amino acids (essential amino acids (EAA)s) are normally administered together with KA. Literature data indicate that the very low protein diet (VLPD) supplemented with KA prevents hyperparathyroidism, insulin resistance, and accumulation of uremic retention solutes— ameliorating renal function and nutritional status [6,16,22,24,25,26,27,28]. Whether isolated supplementation of KA, not associated with low-protein diets, has any benefit on metabolic alterations related to chronic kidney disease (CKD), remains still unexplored. Milovanova and coworkers published a comparative study of LPD supplemented with KA and LPD alone in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 3b–4 stage patients in relation to serum klotho and FGF-23 levels, key markers of cardiovascular complications and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.",109e9de7-77df-498e-bd69-5d8c02243ff6
18,methods19," They found lower FGF-23, and higher Klotho in the LPD + KA group compared to the LPD one, concluding that KA supported the nutritional status and was able to correct FGF-23 and Klotho abnormalities involved in cardiovascular calcification and cardiac remodeling decrease in chronic kidney disease (CKD) [24]. Another study on obese chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients showed that supplementation of KA in long-term administration of a LPD contributed to lower ADMA (asymmetric dimethylarginine), visceral body fat, and proteinuria compared to LPD alone. In the group with co-administration of KA and LPD there was also a decrease of glycated hemoglobin, LDL-cholesterol, and pentosidine, which potentially contributed to slow down the progression of kidney failure [29].",36e3ea79-1a90-4eea-9cf1-76d32f92ecb4
19,methods20," The same group designed a long-term, prospective study on patients with chronic renal failure subjected to three therapeutic protocols: LPD plus KA plus erythropoietin (erythropoietin (EPO)), LPD plus erythropoietin (EPO), and LPD alone [30]. In the first group, after three years’ follow up, serum urea, proteinuria, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol levels, and plasma triglyceride levels declined, whereas albumin and HDL-cholesterol levels increased compared to groups LPD plus erythropoietin (EPO) and LPD alone [30]. These data partially support our findings such as the significant reduction of glycated hemoglobin after MD + KA regimen compared to the MD alone and the very low protein diet (VLPD), as well as the tendency to decrease of proteinuria after the MD + KA regimen compared to the MD alone. On the contrary, KA supplementation to the MD increased triglyceride levels compared both the MD alone and the very low protein diet (VLPD).",0e9bbff5-72d4-4198-98d6-763e2affc1c5
20,methods21," This apparent discrepancy with the cited paper could be attributed to erythropoietin (EPO) effects on the carbohydrate metabolism, which improvement is associated with decreased serum triglycerides [31]. Furthermore, supplementation of KA to MD did not increase the albumin and cholesterol in our patients, as reported in previous investigations [29,30].  The gut microbiota involvement in dietary metabolism is widely recognized [8,32,33]. A strict relationship between gut microbial patterns and different dietary regimen has been demonstrated [16,34]. Similarly, in the present study many of the detected changes were observed strictly related to the very low protein diet (VLPD) more than arising from KA supplementation in the MD. First of all, a decrease in Proteobacteria abundances was found in the very low protein diet (VLPD).",3bdb48e5-c517-47db-8c1c-8aef07b281fe
21,methods22," Although KA supplementation in MD + KA determined a lesser amount of free nitrogenous metabolites into intestinal lumen, this seems not sufficient to reduce the bioavailability of elective substrates for Proteobacteria proliferation. As is well-known, a significant decrease of Proteobacteria in the intestinal milieu of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients represents one of the main outcomes expected from nutritional therapies [35]. Proteobacteria, indeed, play a pivotal role in metabolizing urea and ammonium into uremic toxins [36,37], and higher proteobacteria subtaxa, in particular Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli., have been associated with an injured functionality of kidneys [38]. However, the observed decrease of Euryarchaeota associated with KA supplementation (in both MD + KA and very low protein diet (VLPD)) underlined the effectiveness of KA in reducing, but not significantly, the nitrogenous metabolites such as urea and ammonium.",139a4e44-ebaa-412f-9fbd-b8f35345d466
22,methods23," In this line, high presence of Euryarchaeota and relative subtaxa was previously associated with high urea and NH4 bioavailability [39]. For this reason and considering also their direct contribution to the trimethylamine-(trimethylamine (TMA)) metabolism, taxa of Euryarchaeota were previously associated with different diseases [40]. On the other side, in our study MD + KA reported a trend in reduction of Lactobacillaceae abundances, finding confirmed by the significant negative relationship with the very low protein diet (VLPD) at both family and genus level. The proteolytic metabolism of lactobacilli towards different substrates (e.g., milk and derivates, meat, gluten) has been widely reported [41,42,43] and probably due to this we detected a positive relationship between lactobacilli and azotemia. Otherwise, Lactobacillaceae and lactobacilli repeatedly showed beneficial contributes towards the host health [44].",623211a9-bcd6-4a67-828c-5520f0be9172
23,methods24," Postbiotic metabolites of lactobacilli directly impact on gut health [45] as well as suppressing the expansion of potential pathogenic microorganisms [46,47]. Moreover, they are able to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), i.e., acetic, propionic, and butyric acids [48]. Acetate and butyrate are essential in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, in which the accumulation of urea and ammonia drives the pH out of normal range [49], whereas SCFAs could bring back pH ranges into normal ones [50]. Additionally, lactobacilli and derived SCFAs contributes also to enhance the epithelial layer integrity [51,52,53], therefore reducing the translocation of microbes and metabolites (including urea, ammonia, and uremic toxins) into the systemic circulation, an evidence common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients [54,55].",302ae54e-d45d-476f-a6e6-4d6128bd2ebf
24,methods25," In the very low protein diet (VLPD), the lack in Lactobacillaceae was replaced by a significant increase in bifidobacteria, which, at the same of Lactobacillaceae, are able to produce SCFAs reporting beneficial contributes to the host health and gut permeability [56]. In the present work, this was confirmed by the significant decrease in gut permeability detected in the very low protein diet (VLPD). The same was not observed in MD + KA in which both lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were reduced compared to the MD and very low protein diet (VLPD), respectively. Herein, we observed an increase of Clostridiaceae and Clostridium (sensu stricto) positively associated with the very low protein diet (VLPD) regimen. On note, the observed clostridial increase in the very low protein diet (VLPD) was mainly related to abundances of Clostridium cadaveris, an OTU that recently has been associated with the indole-propionic acid (indole propionic acid (IPA)) metabolism [57].",023840cd-d3d5-4368-b7f0-595659970508
25,methods26," This was interestingly considering that it could result from the strictly vegetable-based diet (i.e., very low protein diet (VLPD)) as previously reported by Tuomainen et al. [58], and it was surprisingly considering that in other clinical trials performed on chronic kidney disease (CKD) patient indole propionic acid (IPA) was considered as a healthy biomarker [59]. In the same line, the high adherence to the very low protein diet (VLPD) probably determined the detected increase of glycated hemoglobin and triglyceride levels resulting from the polysaccharides digestion due to the Lachnospiraceae metabolism. Blautia and Roseburia, both genera of Lachnospiraceae, were found increased in both KA-supplemented diets. Taking into account that Lachnospiraceae are butyrogenic bacteria, this bacterial family reported a controversial role in health and disease [60].",005dc46c-40d0-4ea1-908f-b7c569c07c5c
26,methods27," Lachnospiraceae were reported as the main producers of SCFAs into the gut environment; otherwise, they harvest a great amount energy from diet metabolizing carbohydrates, as markedly codifying butyril-CoA:acetate CoA and butyrate kinase [60]. Additionally, considering the ability of different species of Blautia, in particular B. obeum and B. hydrogenotrophica, to metabolize tyrosine and tryptophan into p-cresol, phenol, and indole [61,62] their elevated abundances into the intestinal lumen of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients cannot be considered as a positive outcome.  Overall, the KA-supplemented MD was not more effective than the MD, or as effective as the very low protein diet (VLPD), in lowering serum levels of total and free IS and p cresyl sulfate (PCS) and in improving the intestinal permeability, although the serum levels of both uremic toxins and of D-lactate tended to be lower after the MD + KA regimen compared to the MD alone.",1d20f496-a8ab-434d-898f-65bdc09fa097
27,methods28," These data suggest that the KA-supplemented MD could still be beneficial in those patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who fail to undergo a very restrictive protein diet such as the very low protein diet (VLPD).  In parallel, the reduction of the urea load caused by the transamination of KA into the corresponding amino acids is not sufficient to exert a beneficial modulation (saccharolytic shift) of the microbiota when not accompanied by an overall restriction of protein intake, as in the very low protein diet (VLPD). To this purpose, the results arising from the present study further clarify the driving role of azotemia in regulating gut integrity status. Gut permeability ameliorates when urea levels decrease, like after a very low protein diet (VLPD) but not after the MD supplemented with KA.",32a4a95b-3634-4483-9c2c-0a915c2233e2
28,methods29," Rather, KA seem to act more at metabolic level on glycemic status, lipid levels, and iron pattern, as evidenced in MD + KA group by amelioration of HbA1c and transferrin levels and by increase of serum triglycerides, the latter probably related to gut microbiota metabolism. We argue that further study, with extended follow up periods and with a larger number of uremic patients are needed to evaluate and to compare the efficacy of these NT on clinical outcomes, such as the start of dialysis, in primis, and the worsening residual renal function. Finally, we can conclude that in the supplemented very low protein diet (VLPD), both KA and the very-low-protein intake act synergistically in the modulation of microbiota and in the consequent amelioration of protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs) levels and gut permeability.

The panel on the left (A) shows the relative abundance (as percentual average) of gut bacterial phyla found in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients after each dietary regimen. Phyla with a relative abundance <0.1% in all samples were grouped together and named “Others”. The right panel (B) shows the relative abundance (as percentual average) of gut bacterial families (>1% at least in one sample) found in the feces of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients after each dietary regimen.",c8190751-1782-4043-a6b0-1ff52e18bd09

Only statistical different (p < 0.05) genera at least in one dietary regimen were reported. Eryt. -Eubacterium: genus Eubacterium belongs to the Erythrobacteraceae family; Pep. -Clostridium: genus Clostridium belongs to the Peptostreptococcaceae family.
