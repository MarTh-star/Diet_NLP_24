0,background0,"Chronic diseases represent a huge personal, social and economic burden and one of the greatest challenges for health systems. They are the leading cause of 68% of the deaths at the global level and approximately 42% of these deaths correspond to people younger than 70 years old. It is estimated that around 80% of cardiovascular diseases and 30% of all cancers could be prevented with the adoption of healthy behaviours: a major portion of these diseases is closely related to smoking, unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, and excessive use of alcohol [1]. Likewise, evidence suggests that diet and physical activity level are important modifiable risk factors for depressive and anxiety disorders [2]. Although social determinants of health play a key role, and there is an important social gradient in the prevalence of risk factors, it is an essential issue to develop effective strategies to cope with them especially in people of low socioeconomic status.",c7dfbe1a-cf68-4ceb-868b-3ad09dac2484
1,background1," Thus, health promotion and prevention is a key process of current health systems with the goals of reducing the risk of disease and disability, contributing to an active and healthy ageing and reducing the need for more expensive health care.  Primary Health Care (Primary Health Care (PHC)) is the most accessible and most commonly used health service which provides an integral and continuous care besides, Primary Health Care (PHC) professionals are the major health-care providers for people with multiple morbidities [3]. That is why Primary Health Care (PHC) is the ideal setting for health promotion and prevention interventions [4, 5]. Furthermore, Primary Health Care (PHC) plays a key part in addressing the social determinants of health, mainly through its role in the community, and contributing, in collaboration with other sectors, to the reduction of social inequalities in health [6].",c653c76f-92bf-4ff8-b4b9-4b36ef1320c9
2,background2," Moreover, as Barbara Starfield points out, to achieve “more effective, more efficient, safer and more equitable” Primary Health Care (PHC) services, the emphasis should shift from treating diseases to caring for individuals and populations [7]. However, the implementation of health promotion and prevention interventions remains suboptimal mainly as a result of work overload and lack of time or training [8–10]. In addition to all these barriers, the most suitable model to approach behaviour change remains unclear, and there is a lack of theoretical basis of interventions, skills in helping people changing behaviour and knowledge of the local context in which these interventions are undertaken [11–13].",a1f6fcc3-d1d0-4f17-b3f9-7ad68c0ec585
3,background3," Likewise, there are intrapersonal (beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, skills, self-concept, motivation and resources) and interpersonal (health professionals, family and friends) factors which affect Primary Health Care (PHC) users’ receptiveness to health promotion and prevention interventions [9]. One aspect to keep in mind is that a high percentage of people who visit their Primary Health Care (PHC) professionals tend to have confidence with them and their suggestions have a high impact in Primary Health Care (PHC) users’ everyday life [14].  On the other hand, although the majority of the adult population engages two or more risk behaviours, most of the time the approach is carried out separately when multiple interventions might be more effective and efficient. Nevertheless, most of the studies have only focused on a single behaviour so the knowledge about the effectiveness of a multiple approach is still limited.",f8679227-9ed1-42bf-a5a8-5b3106159eea
4,background4," However, there has been a sustained rise in studies evaluating multiple behaviour interventions since 2002 [15, 16]. These studies show that multiple interventions approach comprising education and skills training are associated with small reductions in risk behaviours [15].  Health promotion and prevention interventions are complex and need an in-depth understanding of the context which contributes to its effectiveness. Regarding this, the methodology proposed by the Medical Research Council offers a unique opportunity [17]. This methodology proposes a development in five sequential phases in which both quantitative and qualitative methods are used, which include: a) definition of the theoretical basis (preclinical phase), b) modelling (phase I), c) exploratory trial (phase II), d) definitive randomised controlled trial (phase III) and e) long-term implementation (phase IV).",5968fd63-bcf7-4516-ac71-4839c82510b9
5,background5," This methodology promotes the participation of citizens and professionals in research and increases the acceptability and the feasibility of intervention. It is also an ideal tool to achieve the sustainability of interventions and the transfer of research to practice. Research on complex interventions marks a turning point in the conventional way of conducting experimental studies in which the most important thing is finding value and understanding the context of practice rather than trying to control its influence. Hybrid trials represent the ideal design because they allow a joint assessment of clinical effectiveness and implementation, thanks to their dual approach [18]. These trials use theoretical frameworks which ensure a systematic and comprehensive way to understand the determinants of implementation as well as its success and impact [19–21].",1f89b6d3-62d4-4c89-99ca-4c2b72661644
6,background6,"  In this connection, Spanish primary care prevention and health promotion research network (redIAPP) [22] started in 2012 the EIRA study and carried out the first three phases (preclinical phase, phase I and phase II) [8, 9, 23–25]. Currently, the research team is pursuing the phase III through a hybrid trial which aims to evaluatethe effectiveness, the cost-effectiveness and the implementation of a complex multiple risk behaviour intervention to promote healthy behaviours in people between 45 to 75 years attended in Primary Health Care (PHC). This article describes the protocol for this trial.  Study objectives and hypotheses This hybrid trial has the following primary objectives:To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a complex multiple risk intervention on reducing tobacco use, enhancing adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern and increasing physical activitylevel in 12 months to baseline compared with usual care.",2f8a547f-4014-462e-8a30-888da23ef76b

Furthermore, other secondary objectives related to the effectiveness of the intervention will also be evaluated: its impact on reducing cardiovascular and depression risksas well as depressive and anxiety symptoms and incidence of major depression.  We hypothesise that the proportion of people who show a positive behaviour change with regard to any baseline behaviours will be higher among people who receive the intervention than people who receive usual care. We also hypothesise that the intervention will reduce cardiovascular risk, incidence of major depression, depression risk and depressive and anxiety symptoms. ",d3d2d59c-4b46-463d-93c4-2502286dbf5b

40,methods32," we will collect information related to: assigned population (total number; average age; distribution by age group and sex; percentage of immigrants; deprivation index; prevalence of tobacco use; level of physical activity and number of people allocated to home care), organisational structure (population coverage; average attendance; number of physicians, nurses and social workers; accreditation as training health centre; participation in undergraduate and postgraduate training; average visits per day; population per health professional; average time per visit and participation research experience). We will also measure the Primary Health Care (PHC) centres’ internal resources for change by the “Survey of Organizational Attributes for Primary Care” [70].  At the professional level, personal data will be collected (age, sex, academic education and experience in Primary Health Care (PHC)). Primary Health Care (PHC) professionals will have to complete a self-administered questionnaire.",f45e0ce0-8a65-43f7-a324-c664c635a340
41,methods33," This questionnaire collects information about professionals’ behaviours with reference to tobacco use, daily consumption of fruit and vegetables and level of physical activity. In addition only in health professionals of intervention centres, it includes nine items to measure the perception of appropriateness and acceptability of the intervention; these items are based in questionnaires which measure similar constructs [71].  Participant-level data are described in Table 4. Recruitment, first screening for entrance to the study and intervention visits will be done by health professionals. Data collection at participant level will be supported by an external unit of local trained personnel who will carry out two visits (baseline and at the 12 months) in each Primary Health Care (PHC) centre because they are not considered as usual care tasks. Data will be collected by means of an online case report form (CRF) specially designed for the study.",eb2f05fb-7925-4247-87ec-770f64be92d0
42,methods34," This case report form (CRF) will be pilot tested in pre-implementation stage (see Table 3). The management of the study is based on a central coordination unit, a regional coordination unit and a Primary Health Care (PHC) coordination unit using different periodic communication methods (meetings, teleconferences, e-mails, etc.).  Analysis Effectiveness of intervention All analyses will be carried out in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. Depending on the characteristics of the variables, it will be assessed if it is appropriate to make multiple imputationin the variables with missing data or to make a conservative approach to data loss. Multiple imputation will be the preferred technique for dealing with missing data, and the conservative approach will be used when the data indicate that it is the most appropriate. Multiple imputation by chaining equations procedure will be used to obtain at least 20 imputed datasets and Rubin’s rules will be used to combine them [72].",793730d1-5fa2-4358-a823-20201552fd8c
43,methods35," Sensitivity analyses will be performed for the primary and secondary outcomes to assess the impact of the multiple imputation or the conservative approach to data loss.  Descriptive and bivariate analyses will be calculated for all variables of interest. We will use cluster specific methods because Primary Health Care (PHC) centres will be randomised. In order to analyse the effect of the intervention on each outcome measure, we will use hierarchical linear or logistic regressions models for clustered data. We will also analyse the variables associated with the change in the adherence to the Mediterranean diet, physical activity level and smoking cessation adjusting for possible confounding variables. Final models will be chosen coherently with the study objectives and the nature of the variables (potential confounders, significant and clinically relevant variables). The interactions and collinearity of the models will be evaluated.",91b86aa0-4dd5-4a9d-af71-e8ee415d320e
44,methods36," The size of the effect (Cohen’s d) will also be calculatedand the number needed to treat will also be calculated..  The level of significance of the models will be set at 5%. Stata/SE v.15 or higher (StataCorp, LP, TX) and R version 3.4.4 or higher will be used for statistical analysis.  Cost-effectiveness of intervention The incremental cost-utility ratio will be estimated. It will be obtained by calculating the relationship between the cost of the intervention and the usual care, and its consequences expressed in QALYs.  The cost-utility analysis will refer to the incremental analysis as a result of the quotient between the cost difference of the intervention with respect to usual care, and the change in the results of the difference of cost of the intervention over the difference of cost of the usual care (differences in QALYs). Generalised linear models will be used to model costs and QALYs.",85dde9fe-afa6-4648-a1fc-e3fb2a13fce8
45,methods37," Due to the biased distribution of costs, the gamma distribution is usually the most suitable to analyse cost data [73]. The models to estimate differences in costs and QALY will be adjusted for the differences between the two groups in terms of the study covariates. Confidence intervals will be estimated using bootstrap techniques [74] which have the advantage of not having to accept parametric assumptions and whose estimations of standard errors are currently considered very useful and robust in the context of clinical trials [75].  Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be obtained based on the theory of net incremental benefit and different hypothetical values of the maximum availability to pay for health gains. These curves represent the probability that an intervention will be more cost-effective than other alternatives and summarise the uncertainty in cost-effectiveness analysis.  Simple sensitivity analyses will be performed.",38442b4d-91b4-4759-b85c-747630e6efa6
46,methods38," One or more parameters of the evaluation that generate uncertainty will vary in order to see how they affect the robustness of the results. We will conduct a complete case analysis, analysis changing the unit cost of services, andan analysis using the average wage instead of the minimum wage. If the results are sensitive to their variations, simultaneous sensitivity analyses will be performed adjusting for all the sensitive parameters by multiple regression methods.  Effectivenessof implementation strategy The assessment of the implementation strategy will be carried out through qualitative and quantitative methodologies. We will evaluate it in terms of:Implementation outcomes (stated earlier).

47,methods39," Furthermore, three focus groups (one of the health professionals and two of participants) will be conducted in each Primary Health Care (PHC) centre in the post-implementation stage. Sampling will be theoretical (discursive plurality). Sessions will be transcribed in an anonymous way. A thematic content analysis will be done and data will be coded in accordance with CFIR constructs [76]. Moreover, these results will be analysed quantitatively. CFIR constructs will be scored following standard criteria that will reflect the influence of the construct on the implementation (positive or negative) and its magnitude (between 1 and 2) [77].  Level of development. The level of development of each of the implementation strategies will be determined from an online database. Updating of this database will be carried out by the implementation facilitator.",cef68569-7125-423b-8106-82f547b8c21a
48,methods40," Likewise, we will develop logistic regression models in which the dependent variable will be the effectiveness of the intervention, considered as a positive change in any of the three behaviours studied. The independent variables will be the quantitative measures of the results of the implementation and the degree of implementation of the different strategies. The purpose of these analyses is to model the relationship between the implementation variables and those of effectiveness. On the other hand, the influence and the magnitude of the determinants of the implementation and the results will be established through multivariate models.   ",8dc6e391-09cd-4b28-a35a-5adda2914c97
49,discussion0,"Implementation research experts point out that the future studies should be addressed to the sustainable integration of interventions into health care delivery systems [78]. EIRA study is in line with these recommendations as it seeks to achieve changes to promote health through Primary Health Care (PHC) professionals (individual and organisational changes). These changes will reduce the research-practise gap and provide populations health benefits.  To achieve a behaviour change is more feasible when combining individual, group and community interventions [79]. That is why the EIRA study has considered health promotion interventions at these three levels. The study has a person-centred approach that seeks to improve his/her self-efficacy to adopt and sustain healthy behaviours. Because of that, motivational interviewing and information technologies will be used.",dc0d3b10-15b7-4c1c-9327-646369bbce25
50,discussion1," In addition to focusing on the person, the study has a community-centred focus which aims to increase intersectoral linkages and participatory forums at the local level [30].  However, EIRA study will carry out in real-world Primary Health Care (PHC) setting with a broad range of significant implementation challenges. Implementation of health promotion interventions in Primary Health Care (PHC) is not an easy task, especially after the overall economic crisis, the increasing workload of health professionals and the multiple existing barriers. The previous phases of study enabled to identify some of these barriers and introduced changes in the design of the intervention to improve its feasibility such as reduction of the screening for entrance into the study, incorporation of training on motivational interview and increase in the practical training, extension of the period of follow up, etc.",a710c306-31d5-49bd-a0a2-5673b0b1868f
51,discussion2," Therefore, the use of the methodology proposed by Medical Research Council has facilitated the design of this study, though some added difficulties have featured. This new approach in research entails an active role of the different stakeholders to create a feasible intervention. This is a big change in the research culture in the present situation of Spanish Primary Health Care (PHC). Managers, professionals, and researchers are more familiar with the classical methods (clinical trials, for instance) where different factors have to be under control, but not with the uncertainties and variability that implies the adaptation of complex interventions to different Primary Health Care (PHC) centres, and the crucial participation of different stakeholders.",1d1d4cb6-6980-449b-8e00-c092f659158e
52,discussion3,"  EIRA study will determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a complex multiple risk intervention and will provide a better understanding of implementation processes of health promotion interventions in this Primary Health Care (PHC) setting. It may contribute to increase knowledge about the individual and structural barriers that affect implementation of these interventions and to quantify the contextual factors that moderate the effectiveness of implementation. This study, therefore, not only entails the evaluation of a complex intervention in Primary Health Care (PHC) but also a change in the evaluation culture of the Spanish research in Primary Health Care (PHC). The redIAPP, the research network in charge of this study, is introducing this important research perspective in its present scenario.",b41188f8-1622-44df-b31e-a4ccabb5a781
