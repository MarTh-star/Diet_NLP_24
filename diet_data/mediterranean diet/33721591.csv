0,introduction0," Gallstone disease (GD) is a common gastrointestinal disease. It is highly prevalent in western countries, with an average prevalence of 10–20% among adults.1–3 GD has been reported to increase the risks of major chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and gallbladder cancer.4–6 Evidence has suggested that dietary intervention plays a vital role in GD primary prevention.7 Traditional western diet, characterized by high intake of refined grains, fat, and sweets, has been associated with increased risk of GD.8,9 On the contrary, a Mediterranean dietary pattern (Mediterranean diet (MED)), rich in vegetables, fruits, whole-meal cereals, nuts, olive oil, and fish, was reported to be associated with a lower risk of GD.10,11 Unfortunately, these studies are from western countries, and data on the association between diet and GD in Asian countries is limited.",b1b9f68b-0b4b-41fa-b08a-3b219eee60bc
1,introduction1," Moreover, some studies were limited to specific food components or isolated nutrients, which might neglect possible interactions of food.12–14 As a traditional rice-based country, China’s dietary pattern is significantly different from that in the west. There was a cohort study, conducted in Taiwan, that investigated the association between diet and GD, but the target population was vegetarians who completely avoided meat or fish.15 According to previous studies, the effects of a vegetarian diet on the risk of GD remain controversial.16,17  In China, the rate of GD averages between 5% and 11% and is expected to increase in the future.18–20 To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing studies on the association between dietary patterns and GD risks in mainland China. We hypothesized that shifting dietary patterns would be related to the risk of GD, and the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet pattern adjusted for China would be beneficial for lowering risk of GD.",2c1a15af-51a0-43b6-b72d-67142dadbea2
2,introduction2,"  This study was based on the baseline survey of the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort (China Multi Ethnic Cohort (CMEC)) study, which is a large-scale epidemiological study conducted in Southwest China, covering the Sichuan Basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with great diversity in economic status, ethnicity, and diet habit. We developed the Mediterranean diet score adapted to the Southwest China diet (ie, the alternative Mediterranean diet [aMediterranean diet (MED)] score) and the posteriori dietary patterns to investigate the effects of the a priori aMediterranean diet (MED) dietary pattern and posteriori dietary patterns on development of GD in Chinese adults.

4,methods0,"  Study population  This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data from the China Multi Ethnic Cohort (CMEC) study. Detailed information about the China Multi Ethnic Cohort (CMEC) study has been previously reported.21 Briefly, a total of 99,556 middle-aged adults were enrolled in our cohort from May 2018 to September 2019. Participants were from seven ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Yi, Miao, Bai, Bouyei, Dong, and Han, from five provinces (Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Tibet) of Southwest China. The baseline survey consisted of an electronic questionnaire with face-to-face interviews, medical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests.  In this study, participants with a history of cholecystectomy or without abdominal ultrasound examination were excluded. In addition, self-reported cases of GD were also excluded.",91acebc4-0769-47c6-aa20-817516f5e089
5,methods1," Finally, 89,544 adults (35,702 men and 53,842 women) aged 30–79 years with complete and plausible diet-related data were available for the present analysis (eFigure 1). Ethical approval was received from the Sichuan University Medical Ethical Review Board. All the participants signed the informed consent.  Dietary assessment  Habitual dietary intake during the preceding 12 months was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) in the baseline survey. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) comprises a list of 13 commonly consumed foods in southwest China: tubers, red and processed meats, poultry, fish/seafood, eggs, fresh vegetables, soybean products, preserved vegetables, fresh fruits, dairy products, rice, wheat products, coarse grain (including corn, sorghum, and groundnut).",50ca7972-ddf1-48e1-8e17-ad913f185ea0
6,methods2," The food consumption of each group was reported by participants, including the quantity (how many grams per meal according to a standard serving size molds) and frequency (how often timed per day, per week, per month, or per year did they consume during the past 12 months). The consumption of alcohol, tea, beverages, cooking oil, and salt was also recorded in separate sections. In the case of oil and salt, having enquired the household consumption and the number of people eating each meal during the past month, we calculated the daily consumption of cooking oil and salt of each person. The oil types of consumption were also collected, including vegetable oil/sesame oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, lard, and blended oil. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)’s reproducibility and validity have been reported previously, except for the validity of oil and salt, in 24-hour dietary recall.",ea8f942f-5f59-4e05-b995-31770ddbb4b3
7,methods3,"22  Dietary patterns  We developed the aMediterranean diet (MED) score, which was modified from the traditional Mediterranean diet (MED) score and adapted to the Southwest China diet.22,23 The aMediterranean diet (MED) score focuses on eight kinds of intakes (vegetables, legumes, fruit, whole grains, fish, mono-unsaturated fatty acids [MUFA]:saturated fatty acids [SFA] ratio, red and processed meats, and ethanol). We modified the original scale for this study by excluding the dairy group, including only red and processed meats for the meat group, and excluding nuts due to no available information. A score of 1 to 5 was assigned for each kind of food according to the quintile of average food intake, and ethanol was scored according to the moderate alcohol intake criteria. The aMediterranean diet (MED) score was calculated as the sum of points and was expressed in a range from 8 to 40. More details about the scoring criteria can be seen in eTable 1.",0140d685-9f38-409c-8479-166c74db3e14
8,methods4,"  To generate posteriori dietary patterns, the consumption of eighteen food groups intake variables were included in the principal component factor analysis, and varimax (orthogonal) rotation was performed. To identify the number of dietary patterns to retain, the eigenvalues (from the correlation matrix of the standardized variables) >1.4 of a criterion, which was the break-point identified in the scree plot of the eigenvalues, and the characteristics of the ethnic regions were considered. As our previous study has found,22 three dietary patterns (the modern dietary pattern, the coarse grain dietary pattern, and the rice dietary pattern) could obtain the best discrimination among different ethnic regions, which were highly related to three geographic regions: the Sichuan Basin, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The three dietary patterns explained 28.0% of the total variance.",692fcdfd-aeaa-4fab-8be7-3fc9b208f555
9,methods5," The modern dietary pattern was characterized by high loadings of fish/seafood, poultry, eggs, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and dairy products, predominated by the Han majority population in two more developed cities (Chongqing and Chengdu) in the Sichuan Basin. The coarse grain dietary pattern comprised higher consumption of coarse grain, wheat products, tubers, tea, soybean products, preserved vegetables, and red and processed meats, and was lacking fresh vegetables, features of the high-altitude Tibetan dietary pattern. The rice dietary pattern included high loadings of animal oil, rice, preserved vegetables, alcohol, salt, soybean products, and fresh vegetables, suggesting a traditional agricultural dietary pattern followed by various ethnic minority populations in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (Table 1).

10,methods7,"24 All the doctors received standardized training before the investigation. In our study, biliary sludge was classified into the GD group. Cholecystectomy was defined as the absence of the gallbladder on abdominal ultrasonography. To decrease the misdiagnosis rate of ultrasonography, participants’ surgical history was also considered.   Data were extracted from the baseline survey of the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort study. An alternative Mediterranean diet (aMediterranean diet (MED)) score was assessed based on a food frequency questionnaire, and three posteriori dietary patterns (the modern dietary pattern, the coarse grain dietary pattern, and the rice dietary pattern) were identified using factor analysis. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the association between dietary patterns and GD risks. ",f6ef39d6-0333-48c6-856d-2561d119827b
11,analysis0," Baseline descriptions were expressed as means and standard deviations for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables according to quintiles of dietary pattern scores. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for GD according to quartiles in different dietary patterns, and the lowest quartile was used as the reference group. Based on the previous literature, we included the following predefined confounders in the multivariable-adjusted models: age, sex, ethnicity, urbanicity, annual family income, occupation, education level, marital status, total energy intake, physical activity, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), smoking status, regular intake of beverages, regular intake of dietary supplements, menopause status (women only), and history of diabetes. We used two models: one only adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity, and one fully adjusted using the aforementioned covariates.",22a460be-1d9f-4716-a0a9-09ed28f2c6c5
12,analysis1," The linear trend analysis across quartiles in the logistic models was performed by assigning a median value to each quartile of the dietary score and modeling it as a continuous variable.  To facilitate interpretation of the results, we carried out a single-group analysis to evaluate the association of each of the food components with GD risks. All components of food in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and the aMediterranean diet (MED) score were simultaneously introduced in models, allowing assessment of the relative impact of each component. Furthermore, stratified analysis was also performed to evaluate associations of dietary patterns with GD risk across subgroups of sex, age, urbanicity, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, history of diabetes, and ethnic group.  To test the sensitivity of our findings, analysis was repeated after excluding those with biliary sludge (n = 962).

Participants with a higher score of aMediterranean diet (MED) dietary pattern and the modern dietary pattern shared similar characteristics. They were more likely to be younger, urban residents, have a higher education level, higher family income, lower physical activity, and were more likely to report a history of diabetes.

In the stratified analysis, associations generally did not differ between dietary patterns and GD risks, although not all subgroups indicated a significant difference. It is worth noting that none of the associations were not evident among men. Actually, the prevalence of GD was higher in women than in men (7.9% vs 6.8%) in this study. The aMediterranean diet (MED) dietary pattern showed a positive association with GD risk in females, those 60 years old and above, those without diabetes, and participants in the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau group.",d9b782bf-6b05-4170-b15d-7ba8edb71906

21,discussion0,"  Based on large-scale epidemiological data from Southwest China, our study showed that the rice dietary pattern has an inverse association with GD risks. Unexpectedly, aMediterranean diet (MED) was positively associated with GD risks in our study. Findings were similar after additional adjustment for potential confounders and after exclusion of biliary sludges. This surprising finding seems to be contrary to previous research, as a typical Mediterranean diet (MED) dietary pattern has been extensively associated with numerous health benefits.28 Actually, research focusing on overall dietary patterns and risk of GD disease is limited. A cohort study of male American health professionals found that higher adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) was associated with a lower risk of symptomatic GD disease.10 A similar result was found in a French cohort study.",84ce59d3-09de-463e-be47-fc213d79f796
22,discussion1,"11 The Mediterranean diet (MED) diet pattern is typical in these studies, with dietary intake including vegetables, fruits, nuts, dairy, legumes, cereals, fish, meat and meat products, alcohol, MUFA/SFA, and olive oil. However, olive oil is rarely consumed in non-Mediterranean populations, resulting in a lack of high-quality sources of MUFA. Therefore, the high score of MUFA:SFA can only reflect a high consumption of vegetable oils in our study,22 as shown in eTable 4. The contrary effects of aMediterranean diet (MED) in our study might be ascribed to the different types of oil intake. Furthermore, according to the single-food component analysis of aMediterranean diet (MED), we found that MUFA:SFA contributed most to the risk of GD, which might imply that a high-fat diet should be considered as a risk factor for GD (eTable 2).",a7be186b-9d32-4bc0-88c4-80cf356ac927
23,discussion2,"29  The rice dietary pattern, characterized by a poor and traditional agricultural dietary pattern, with higher consumption of animal oil, rice, preserved vegetables, alcohol, salt, soybean products, fresh vegetables, and tubers, was associated with decreased risk of GD in this study. Accordingly, most of the food components were plant-based. Previous research on the effects of a vegetarian diet (containing no meat or fish) remain contradictory.17,30,31 A British cohort study (n = 49,652) suggested that vegetarians had a moderately increased risk of GD compared with non-vegetarians.16 On the other hand, a recent study conducted in Taiwan (n = 6,002) found that a vegetarian diet was associated with a decreased risk of GD in women.15 Though the rice dietary pattern is not a vegetarian diet completely avoiding meat or fish, it also exerted a beneficial effect on the lower risk of developing GD.",a18327ff-a3b2-4e7a-8c63-f5d981ff596d
24,discussion3," It is worth noting that animal oil was loaded higher in the rice dietary pattern, which is a source of SFA. Several studies showed that SFA might enhance the formation of cholesterol cholelithiasis.32 In fact, 60.3% of our study participants did not consume animal oil. In the highest score quintile of rice dietary pattern, 65.9% of participants consume oils blended with vegetable oil (including rapeseed oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, and peanut oil) and lard. Wang et al found that the oil mixture containing lard and soybean oil had a remarkable anti-obesity effect.33 Besides, other interactions between food or nutrient combinations are also possible. From the stratified analysis, the rice dietary pattern exerted stronger effects among females, older, urban, and obese participants, and those with diabetes, factors associated with higher rates of GD. A plant-based diet may help in the prevention of GD, especially in high-risk populations.",102dc201-2bdf-4855-aa4f-1dd7d0301dfd
25,discussion4,"  Interestingly, the coarse grain dietary pattern, also a plant-based diet, showed a positive association with GD prevalence. The lack of fresh vegetables might be a reason, since fresh vegetables were of benefit to reduce GD risk in the single-food component analysis (eTable 3). The modern dietary pattern was related to a lower risk of GD only when participants were under 60 years old and free of diabetes. The modern dietary pattern represents a shifted dietary pattern in China to some extent. More attention needs to be paid to nutrient balance, since China is experiencing a rapid diet shift from a plant-based diet as the economy continues to develop.  To our knowledge, the present study is the first large-scale study to investigate the association between dietary patterns and GD risks in China. The large sample size is the first strength of our study, which enabled adjustment for many potential confounders and stratified analysis with sufficient power.",fca27c9d-3f10-46ed-8ddf-5a6acf8ce645
26,discussion5," Besides, ultrasonography was used to determine the presence of GD instead of self-reported measures. Lastly, our study assessed the associations of both a priori and posteriori dietary patterns with GD risks, which provided complementary outcomes and a more comprehensive assessment of participants’ diet habits. However, limitations are also worth noting. First, the cross-sectional study was not able to determine a causal relationship between diet and GD. We tried to minimize the potential reverse causality by excluding self-reported cases. Second, it is hard to determine the types of GD (mostly classified as cholesterol and pigment GD) using ultrasonography, so the diet difference towards different types of GD cannot be evaluated. Third, the validity of oil and salt was not evaluated in our study. Although we assessed the reproducibility, the validity was hard to calculate, as it is not feasible to assess condiments intake in 24-hour dietary recall.",d95750aa-a7a5-4a1c-8c2c-c23f0fbc1611
27,discussion6," Finally, although we adjusted for a variety of potential confounders, some possibility of residual or unmeasured confounding due to different lifestyles and various geographical conditions cannot be excluded.  Conclusion  In conclusion, our findings suggest a protective role of the rice dietary pattern against the risk of GD. For high-risk populations, making some shift to a traditional agricultural diet might help with the primary prevention of GD. Still, these initial results need to be confirmed by future prospective studies.
