0,background0,"Breast cancer is a malignant tumor, originating from the breast’s glandular tissue. It is one of the most frequent malignant tumors in most Western countries [1]. Breast cancer is a common cause of death of women between 40 and 50 years of age [2]. Risk factors for breast cancer are among many others: age, parity, hormone replacement therapy, menopausal status, and family history of breast cancer [3]. Increased mammographic density is an important independent risk factor for breast cancer [4]. High breast density is consistent with the breast’s amount of fibroepithelial tissue [5], which appears as radiographic dense on mammograms [5]. The biological pathways linking high mammographic density with breast cancer still need further investigation.  Mammography is a radiological method for the measurement of breast density [6] and for early detection of breast cancer [7]. Different scales can be used to evaluate the mammographic density.",a6af55f6-0ef7-4dbd-9eeb-4e700ea6321a
1,background1," The first classification was established by Wolfe in 1976 [8]. Another classification, BI-RADS with American College of Radiology (ACR)-categories, was developed by the American College of Radiology and published in 1993 [7]. It helped to standardize mammography reports, breast density evaluation and the interpretation of mammograms [7]. Other methods to quantify breast density, like ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, also applied in breast diagnostic.  Breast density may be a possible surrogate marker in the prevention of breast cancer [9]. It is important to identify factors which modify mammographic density and thereby might be useful as a basis of preventive interventions. There is evidence that exogenous hormones, a larger number of live births, age, body-mass-index and other factors can alter the pattern of breast density on a mammogram [3].",4c853ec5-1274-4a59-9ba3-2ba56483fd7e
2,background2," Especially adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern, intake of multivitamin-multimineral supplements and alcohol consumption could be established as basic interventions in prevention of high mammographic density in the future [4,9]. These factors show an association with breast cancer risk and more easily modifiable than reproductive factors. Alcohol consumption may have an influence on breast neoplasm formation [10]. It remains unclear whether alcohol consumption increases the mammographic density, compared to non-drinkers. Breast cancer prevalence is lower in Mediterranean populations than in northern European ones [11]. The differences in prevalence could be explained by different dietary patterns in Mediterranean and northern European populations. A Mediterranean dietary pattern is characterized by regular consumption of fruit, vegetables and olive oil [11]. The northern European diet is characterized by high consumption of meat and saturated fatty acids [11].",19f7943a-4ff2-4525-b9a5-58e30803d62e
3,background3," It may be important to clarify whether an association between the mammographic density of breast tissue and an adherence to Mediterranean diet exists.  This study aims to investigate the association between Mediterranean dietary pattern, current intake of multivitamin-multimineral supplements, and alcohol consumption with mammographic density.

4,methods0,"Study population Between April 2007 and September 2008 494 women aged 21 to 84 years, who underwent mammography at the breast center in University Hospital Ulm, were recruited in this cross-sectional study. After informed consent they completed a self-administered questionnaire. From the statistical analysis 65 participants were excluded due to history of breast ablation and breast cancer and 5 participants filled in the questionnaire twice. Thus 424 women remained for the analysis.  A study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of Ulm University.  Data assessment The questionnaire assessed socio-demographic characteristics, including date of birth, nationality, body weight, height and education. Furthermore, participants were asked to comment on their consumption of food, beverages, physical activity and their smoking status. The food questionnaire of this study was partially adapted from the food questionnaire of the Million Women Study [12].",0eac8415-227c-4e06-a18e-4275370cd636
5,methods1," The choice of the components was based on the hypothesis that a low consumption of “unhealthy” food, such as meat (contains saturated fatty acids) [13] and a high consumption of “healthy” food, such as fruits (contain antioxidants) [14] protect against a high mammographic density as indicator for higher breast cancer risk. Participants provided information on reproductive factors, such as age at menarche, menopausal status and parity, and family history of breast cancer. Data on hormone replacement therapy, biopsy of breast and past medical history was also included.  In this study, we collected information of the supplementary intake of vitamins and minerals both individually and combined. Due to the small numbers on single vitamin and mineral use, we investigated the association between intake of multivitamin-multimineral supplements and mammographic density.",e164667e-09e1-44e9-8d9c-79eae4606429
6,methods2," The corresponding question in our questionnaire was: “Do you take vitamins, minerals or dietary supplements regularly?”  Data on the consumption of wine, beer and spirits beverages in glasses per week has been collected to assess a drinking of alcoholic beverages. We calculated how much alcohol in g (gram) each woman consumed according to conversions described in other German studies [15,16]. The following conversions were made:  wine: 1 glass = 0.25 liter [15].  beer: 1 glass = 0.3 liter.  spirits beverage: 1 glass = 0.02 liter.  1 liter wine = 100 g alcohol, and  1 liter beer = 40 g alcohol [16].  There were 25 g alcohol in 1 glass wine; 12 g alcohol in 1 glass bier and 6.2 g alcohol in 1 glass spirits beverage [16]. On the basis of this data, we calculated the total alcohol consumption (wine, beer and spirits beverage) per day (d) in gram for each participant. We created quantitative (increase per 10 g/d) and qualitative variables to analyze alcohol consumption.",8749f9d2-9944-453d-85bf-96adc9808e63

We selected the dietary components contributing to a score based on other studies of adherence to Mediterranean diet. Based on other studies on the adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern [11,17] we selected the dietary components in our study. The following foods were included: boiled and raw vegetables, fruit, fish, nuts and olive oil (pro-Mediterranean diet); butter, beef, pork, sausages, ham, hamburger and lemonade/soft drinks (contra-Mediterranean diet). Points were assigned for pro-Mediterranean food: low consumption = 1 point, regular consumption = 2 points, frequent consumption = 3 points. Points for contra-Mediterranean food were reversed: low consumption = 3 points, regular consumption = 2 points, frequent consumption = 1 point. In cases of no consumption or where no information was provided, 0 points were given.",8ad6d6a4-d2c9-43e4-bc21-de79b15be357

9,methods5,"  Mammographic density assessment Breast density was assessed by two radiologists of the University Hospital Ulm applying the classification of the American College of Radiology (American College of Radiology (ACR)) including four categories: American College of Radiology (ACR) 1 = almost entirely fat, glandular tissue <25%; American College of Radiology (ACR) 2 = scattered fibroglandular densities (ca. 25–50% of the breast); American College of Radiology (ACR) 3 = heterogeneously breast dense (ca. 51–75% of the breast); American College of Radiology (ACR) 4 = extremely dense (>75% of the breast) [7].",7974e72b-f8aa-41e0-8035-dc68cff30392
10,methods6," For the analyses the American College of Radiology (ACR) categories were combined: category American College of Radiology (ACR) 1/2 (including American College of Radiology (ACR) 1 and American College of Radiology (ACR) 2) means lower density and category American College of Radiology (ACR) 3/4 (including American College of Radiology (ACR) 3 und American College of Radiology (ACR) 4) means higher density of breast. The measurement of the left breast was incorporated into the statistical analysis. Breast densities were assessed by two radiologists separately to determine inter-rater reliability. The differences in assessment of mammographic density between these two raters were calculated with the kappa-value. According to Altman’s interpretation of kappa-values [18], the inter-rater variability assessed by kappa statistics showed moderate agreement (0.",07b22651-ca41-49de-a3a3-f10739e2f348

We defined the level of statistical significance as 0.05. We used these tests to investigate the significance of relationships between possible confounders (such as Body Mass Index (BMI), education, etc.) and either the target variable (mammographic density) or influencing variables (such as current intake of multivitamin-multimineral supplements, current alcohol consumption and Mediterranean dietary pattern). Tests for trend across quartiles were performed by assigning the mean level within specific quartiles of alcohol intake to all individuals in that quartile, and using this as a continuous variable in a linear regression. Logistic regression models were fitted to obtain Odds Ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for high mammographic density.",421353d8-9626-4311-ae02-168d190e5205

21,discussion0,"Adherence to Mediterranean diet was inversely associated with mammographic density. Our data show further that the consumption of multivitamin-multimineral supplements is associated with a reduction in mammographic density. High levels of alcohol consumption may be related to higher mammographic density.  Mediterranean diet In line with former research on diet and mammographic density, we found an inverse association between the adherence to Mediterranean diet score and mammographic density [11,19,20]. Our results did not change by additional adjustment for alcohol consumption and multivitamin-multimineral supplements.  Previous analyses of single food groups and mammographic density showed that components of the Mediterranean diet such as vegetables and olive oil could be inversely associated [20].",0b3f0b86-8fb8-47b2-b055-04a29be778b8
22,discussion1," Consistent with our finding of an inverse association among postmenopausal women, prospective studies on breast cancer have shown that conformity to Mediterranean diet is associated with reduced breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women [17,21]. However, among postmenopausal women in Japan intakes of protein, total fat, and saturated fat were significantly positively associated with percentage of mammographic density [22], while carbohydrates were inversely associated. For components of the Mediterranean diet biological mechanisms have been described related to antioxidants, phytoestrogens and fatty acids [23]. In an observational study inverse associations between phytoestrogens and mammographic density have been reported [24].  In contrast to Tseng et al. (2008) we observed a statistically significant inverse association of Mediterranean diet score with mammographic density among non-smoking women.",4ca3d1b9-003b-4d01-aeb5-928ce3356034
23,discussion2,  Multivitamin-multimineral supplements Our findings of an inverse association between the current use of multivitamin-multimineral supplements and mammographic density in postmenopausal women are in contrast to results from a case–control study showing that multivitamin-multimineral supplement use is associated with higher breast density among premenopausal women [25]. Our results did not substantially change by additional adjustment for educational levels or other adjustment variables. Due to the antioxidant property of vitamins and minerals an inverse association seems to be biologically plausible [26].  Epidemiological studies on diet have shown inverse associations between vitamin D intake and mammographic density [27]. For the intake of vitamin C and E positive associations with mammographic density [19] and inverse associations for vitamin C intake have been reported [20].  Women who take multivitamin-multimineral supplement may have a healthier lifestyle than others.,f3719280-969e-4f92-8be5-109c0a61e046
24,discussion3," However, differences in the composition of the multivitamin-multimineral supplement pills and the inclusion of potential confounders could have influenced the associations. Data on use of vitamin and mineral supplements and its combination are scarce [25].  Alcohol consumption In our study, current alcohol intake of more than 10g/d was associated with high mammographic density in pre- and postmenopausal women. Results from prospective [20,28], case–control [29] and cross-sectional [30] studies have shown that increased alcohol intake is associated with mammographic more dense breast parenchyma. However, also no association between alcohol intake and mammographic density was found in a cross-sectional study [31]. Flom et al. investigated alcohol beverages and found that particularly beer and white wine consumption may increase mammographic density [28].",f6631356-d3a2-420e-8ea2-0a024692c81d
25,discussion4,"  There is evidence linking alcohol by Insulin-like growth factor (Insulin like growth factor (IGF)) and Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (Insulin like growth factor (IGF)BP)-3 to mammographic density [32,33]. In addition, alcohol increases estrogen levels in blood [34] which were found to increase mammographic density [35].  Strengths and limitations One potential limitation of this study is that measurement error is inherent in dietary assessment. However, our data for alcohol were consistent with other data from Germany [16], and for dietary variables long-term reproducibility was fairly [36] indicating that dietary habits are stable over longer time intervals.  In the Mediterranean diet score in cases with no information on food items (e.g. for fish), 0 points were given. However, exclusion of individuals without information revealed similar results in the fully adjusted model without elimination of these women.",473aed7d-7f60-4e0f-84f2-0944da7f5b44
26,discussion5,"  Since a cross-sectional study was performed, we cannot appraise the time sequence of the associations. The data on exposure variables were collected retrospectively, which may have introduced recall bias. However, it is likely to be non differential.  The assessment of the mammograms by experienced radiologists is one of the strengths of our study. In addition, we calculated the fully adjusted and the parsimonious models which revealed similar results but only statistical significance was reached in the parsimonious models.  The inter-rater reliability for the analyzed categories of American College of Radiology (ACR) classification as indicator for mammographic density was good. American College of Radiology (ACR) classification of mammographic density is widely applied and it has been shown that it is correlated with more refined measurement methods [8]. Information on reproductive and use of exogenous hormones has been collected by a standardized questionnaire.",7068d466-54af-4125-96b1-4a4c710cf266
27,discussion6," However, in our data these variables did not substantially affect the estimates.  Conclusions In summary, this study suggests that adherence to the Mediterranean diet and current use of multivitamin-multimineral supplements are associated with mammograhically less dense breast parenchyma as intermediary marker of breast cancer risk. Further studies are needed to investigate the value of dietary intervention in the prevention of breast cancer.
