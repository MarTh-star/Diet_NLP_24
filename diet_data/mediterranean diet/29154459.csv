0,methods0,"2.1. Design and Setting This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in patients with HS attending the Unit of Endocrinology, Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University Federico II of Naples (Italy), from January 2017 to April 2018. The study was approved by the Local Ethical Committee (n. 201/15) and carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans. The purpose of the protocol was clearly explained to all the study participants, and a written informed consent was obtained. The study was conducted without support from the pharmaceutical industry. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03683238.  2.2. Population Study The subjects were enrolled in the outpatient Dermatologic and Endocrinology clinics in our Department.",3103c463-929f-4ae3-9d61-7e5f320354cc
1,methods1," The study included 41 treatment-naive patients of both genders out of 63 unselected Caucasian subjects affected by HS attending the Outpatient Clinic of the Unit of Dermatology of the same Department. Forty-one Caucasian healthy subjects (ascertained by participant questionnaire excluding the presence of clinical conditions that potentially influences fluid balance, i.e., myocardial, renal, or endocrine diseases) with body mass index (BMI) ranging 19.2–48.1 kg/m2 were chosen as controls among hospital volunteers and employees from the same geographical area around Naples (Italy). Controls were matched by age, sex and body mass index (BMI) and a full medical history, including drug use, was collected. In both groups, all female subjects were assessed during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. They did not report being pregnant or to be lactating. To increase the homogeneity of the patient sample we included treatment-naive adult patients only.",9c91f94f-db60-424d-b632-852a0ed44e1b
2,methods2," In particular, the patients were eligible for the study if they had HS diagnosed ≥6 months before study initiation without therapy for at least 3 months. All three diagnostic criteria for HS had to be met: Presence of typical lesions, anatomical sites involved in typical areas and an evolving disease course with relapses and chronicity. While, the exclusion criteria were the following:  1. Occasional or current of use of drugs for HS, including topical antibiotics and systemic treatments (such as clindamycin–rifampicin, tetracycline, Rifampicin–moxifloxacin–metronidazole, ertapenem, acitretin, cyclosporine A, dapsone, isotretinoin, biologics (10 subjects);  2. Specific nutritional pattern or hypocaloric diet in the last three months (two subjects);  3. Supplementation with antioxidants, vitamins or minerals (three subjects);  4. Use of drugs affecting fluid balance, including hormone replacement therapy (four subjects) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (three subjects).",dc9657be-6a34-4b99-b3cd-dcef0061afa1
3,methods3,"  The flow chart of study subjects is reported in Figure 1. The clinical and biochemical assessment were done between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m., after an overnight fast.  Power Size Justification The power size was calculated based on the following assumptions:  1. In the absence of clinical studies with similar experimental design currently available in the literature, the calculation of the sample size was performed a priori by considering the effect size 0.8 with type I error of 0.05 and a power of 90%. The number of subjects to be enrolled was found to be 34 per group, that we decided to round up to 41, with a total of 82 total subjects enrolled in the study in order to replace drop out patients. The calculation of the Sample Size was performed using G*Power Software (G*power software Version 3.1.9.2, Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany).  2. The power sample was calculated by the differences of means ± standard deviation (SD) of PhA in each group (6.06).",6c0fb4e9-c725-4456-9f55-41265f50f9a9
4,methods4," Considering a number of cases required in each group were set at 41 per group, a type I (alpha) error of 0.05 (95%), and a type II (beta) of 0.05 were used, the calculated power size was 95%. The calculation of power size was performed using Sample Size Calculator Clinical Calc (ClinCalc LLC, Chicago, IL, USA).  2.3. Lifestyle Habits We defined current smokers were subjects smoking at least one cigarette per day, former smokers were subjects who had stopped smoking at least one year before the interview, and non-current smokers as the remaining participants. Participants habitually engaged in at least 30 min/day of aerobic exercise (YES/NO) were defined as physically active.  2.4. Anthropometric Measurements and Blood Pressure The anthropometric measurements were performed by the same operator (a nutritionist experienced in providing nutritional assessment and body composition), according to the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK 2006).",a31d071f-aceb-4449-8c68-9aacb1f9b1a0
5,methods5," body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the ratio between weight and square of height (kg/m2). WC was measured according to Nishida et al. [32]. Further details are reported in Supplementary data.  2.5. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis Body composition was assessed using a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) phase-sensitive system by experienced observers (an 800-µA current at a signal-frequency of 50 kHz bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) 101 RJL, Akern Bioresearch, Florence, Italy) [33], as previously reported [34,35,36,37]. The exam was performed as suggested by the European Society of Parental and Enteral Nutrition (European Society of Parental and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN)) [38]. Electrodes were placed on the hand and the ipsilateral foot, according to Kushner (1992) [39]. The PhA was obtained from conditions under 50 kHz according to the following formula: PhA (°, degrees) = arctangent reactance (Xc)/ resistance (R) × (180/π).",c782381a-644e-4316-be0a-e5fe5ae5ff83
6,methods6," Further details are reported in the Supplementary data.  2.6. Adherence to the MD The adherence to the MD was assessed using a PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire, consisting of 14 items [40]. This questionnaire, which had already been used in previous studies [36,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48], was administered by a qualified nutritionist during a face-to-face interview. Briefly, by assigning a score 1 and 0 for each item, PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score was calculated as follows: 0–5, lowest adherence; score 6–9, average adherence; score ≥10, highest adherence [40].  2.7. Dietary Assessment As we have already fully reported in previous studies [42,43,45,47,48,49], nutritional data was obtained by a face-to-face interview administered by a qualified nutritionist.",e43f017a-321c-4064-9989-7eb724f02e3b
7,methods7," In detail, a photographic food atlas (≈1000 photographs) of known portion sizes was used to quantify foods and drinks [50] and the 7-day food records were used to collect dietary data, including beverage intakes. On the basis of these records, the nutritionist calculated the total energy intake and the quantities of macronutrients.  2.8. Classification and Severity Assessment of HS As a gold standard is still lacking, the disease severity assessment of HS was assessed using three scoring systems, including Sartorius HS score, Hurley Stages, and HS Physician’s Global Assessment (Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA)) [8]. The Sartorius HS score is a clinical classification system based on the counting of single fistulas and nodules within seven anatomical regions [51], and the measurement of the longest distance between two lesions of the same type within each anatomical region (axilla, gluteal, groin, genital, or other inflammatory sites left and/or right) [8].",3b279fdb-cef7-46f2-870e-e60c3b37679a
8,methods8," The Hurley system describes three distinct clinical stages, in particular: “Stage I: Abscess formation, single or multiple, without sinus tracts and cicatrization; stage II: Recurrent abscesses with tract formation and cicatrization, single or multiple, widely separated lesions; and stage III: Diffuse or near-diffuse involvement, or multiple interconnected tracts and abscesses across the entire area”. Finally, according to the HS-Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) HS severity was classified by counting “the number of abscesses, fistulas, and inflammatory and non-inflammatory nodules in all skin areas stages, on a scale from 1 to 6 (from stage 1: Clear, no inflammatory or non-inflammatory nodules to stage 6: Severe, >5 abscesses or draining fistulas)” [52,53]. The dermatologists who evaluated the clinical severity of HS were blinded to the design of the study to prevent rate biases.  2.9.",f2b71365-1571-4b36-a385-5cd76a2e0f0d
9,methods9," Evaluation of the Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein Levels Blood samples were collected via brachial puncture into 5-mL heparin vacuum tubes. The samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at RT, and sera were separated and stored at −80 °C for further analysis (maximum, 6 months). The plasma levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) were measured by using the LP-CHOLOX test carried out on an automated analyzer (Free Carpe Diem, Diacron International, Grosseto, Italy), using a commercial kit (Diacron International, Grosseto, Italy) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The LP-CHOLOX test evaluates a class of hydroperoxides derived from the lipid peroxidation, which are mainly represented by oxidized cholesterol. Peroxides are able to promote the oxidation of the ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+).",80f41463-75b9-419a-a18f-00cd2fd54458
10,methods10," The LP-CHOLOX test is based on the spectrophotometric measurement (at 505 nm) of the colored complex developed by the binding between the Fe3+ and the thiocyanate. The absorbance values are directly proportional to the lipoperoxides concentrations, and the values are related to specific standard solution (400 μEq/L). Results are expressed in μEq/L, and reference values are: Normal, ≤599 μEq/L; slight alteration, from 600 to 799 μEq/L; moderate alteration, from 800 to 999 μEq/L; strong alteration, ≥1000 μEq/L [54,55].  2.10. Statistical Analysis The data distribution was evaluated by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the abnormal data were normalized by logarithm. Skewed variables were back-transformed for presentation in tables and figures. Results are expressed as mean ± SD.",13a162c0-9cc4-49d1-b2b8-74d608a9d8d8
11,methods11," The chi square (χ2) test was used to determine the significance of differences in frequency distribution of gender, smoking habit, physical activity, body mass index (BMI) categories, WC cut-offs, and dietary components included in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire. Differences between HS patients and the control group were analyzed by Student’s paired t-test, while the differences among the several parameters with the clinical severity of HS according to the Hurley system and HS-Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) grades were analyzed by Student’s unpaired t-test. The correlations between study variables were performed using Pearson r correlation coefficients. The association among quantitative variables (Hurley system and HS-Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) grades) with body composition, total energy and daily macronutrients/micronutrients intake were assessed with proportional Odds Ratio (OR) models, 95% Interval Confidence (IC), and R2.",75174d23-93c0-4023-a0c5-6cf4f7f41253
12,methods12," Receiver operator characteristic (receiver operator characteristic (ROC)) curve analysis which were performed to establish sensitivity and specificity, area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)), and IC, as well as cut-off values for PhA and PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score in detecting Sartorius HS scores above the median values in the HS patients. Test area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was also calculated and we entered 0.957 for area under the curve (AUC) receiver operator characteristic (ROC) and 0.5 for the null hypothesis values. An α level of 0.05 (type 1 error) and a β level of 0.20 (type II error) were used as the cut-off values for statistical significance. Only variables that had a p-value < 0.05 in the univariate analysis (partial correlation) were entered. Variables with a variance inflation factor (variance inflation factor (VIF)) >10 were not considered to avoid multicollinearity.",c54c77f4-fa1a-4355-908b-886c2cd56426
13,methods13," Values ≤ 5% were considered statistically significant. Data were collected and analyzed using the MedCalc® package (Version 12.3.0 1993–2012 MedCalc Software bvba—MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium).  3. Results The study population consisted of 82 participants, 41 patients with HS and 41 healthy subjects as a control group. All case-patients completed the study protocol including nutritional assessment, PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements. The HS Sartorius score was 51.0 (33.0–81.0). According to the Harley grade and HS-Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA), 14, 24 and 3 patients presented with grade 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Considering the number of grade 3 patients, HS patients with grade 2–3 were included in the same group for the following analysis. These results are shown in the Tables S1–S5.",f72aafde-6292-4f09-8b18-65e6026f7ce4
14,methods14,"  As reported in Table 1, no significant differences were evident in lifestyle habits and anthropometric measurements between HS patients and healthy subjects.  The body composition evaluated by the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameters of the HS patients and the control group are shown in Table 2. In particular, HS patients had the lowest values of reactance (Xc) (p = 0.003), PhA (p < 0.001), intra-cellular water (intra cellular water (ICW)) (%), and the highest values of extra-cellular water (extra cellular water (ECW)) (p < 0.001).  Analyzing the details of the response frequency of dietary components included in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire, we found that HS patients consumed less frequently red meat and more frequently fish/seafood (Table 3).  Data on Mediterranean food frequencies were further analyzed by using the 7-day food records.",f1546b91-09d8-496a-86c2-6ae01785a660
15,methods15," As shown in Table 4, in spite of no differences in energy intake between the two groups, HS patients consumed a lower quantity of complex carbohydrate, monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)), and a higher quantity of saturated fatty acid (saturated fatty acid (SFA)) and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than healthy individuals.  receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the cut off values of the PhA and the adherence to the MD that were predictive of highest Sartorius HS scores (above the median value 51) (Figure 2a,b). A value of PhA of ≤5.7 (p < 0.001, area under the curve (AUC) 0.919, standard error 0.040, 95% CI 0.790 to 0.981) and a score of PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score of ≤5.0 (p < 0.001, area under the curve (AUC) 0.762, standard error 0.077, 95% CI 0.603 to 0.",2353f21f-2b4a-468d-b442-fc4710d62a56
16,methods16,"881) could serve as a thresholds for a significantly increased risk of high Sartorius HS scores.  Correlation Studies The correlations between HS Sartorius score and body composition evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameters are summarized in Table 5. Also, after adjusting for sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and total energy intake, HS Sartorius score showed significant negative correlations with PhA (p < 0.001), but not with R and Xc, fat mass (FM) (p = 0.001), intra cellular water (ICW) (p < 0.001), and had positive associations with free fat mass (free fat mass (FFM)) (%), and extra cellular water (ECW) (p = 0.004).  In Figure 3 we show the differences in HS Sartorius scores across the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) categories. Higher values of HS Sartorius scores were evidenced in low adherers, compared with average-higher adherers (p < 0.001).",2a557c42-174d-48e9-b50d-58f909e15958
17,methods17,"  Consequently, the highest HS Sartorius score was significantly associated with lowest score of PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score (r = –0.552, p < 0.001), and this correlation remained significant also after adjusting for sex, age, body mass index (BMI) and total energy intake (r = –0.454, p = 0.005), as showed in Figure 4.  In Table 6 we show the correlations among HS Sartorius scores, total energy and daily macronutrients intake evaluated by using the 7-day food records. The HS Sartorius score showed highly positive correlations with total and simple carbohydrate and a negative correlation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA); however, after adjusting for sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) only the negative correlation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) remained significant. After adjusting for sex, age, body mass index (BMI) and total energy intake, ox-LDL levels were positively correlated with the HS Sartorius score (r = 0.436, p = 0.",8e4e7dbe-d608-4daa-a20f-1e70f1a8d46e
18,methods18,"007), and negatively with PhA (r = −0.506, p = 0.001) and PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score (r = −0.701, p < 0.001). Similar correlations were also found by using the Harley grade severity of HS and the data are reported in the supplementary files.  To evaluate the relative prognostic value of the measures of body composition and nutritional status to predict the clinical severity of HS, we performed two multiple linear regression analysis models that included measures of the body composition parameters (model I), PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) scores, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and ox-LDL (model II). Using model I, PhA entered at the first step (p < 0.001) and appeared to be among the body composition measures exerting the most powerful influence on HS Sartorius scores, explaining 82.0% of HS Sartorius score variability, while the other variables (FM, free fat mass (FFM), extra cellular water (ECW), intra cellular water (ICW)) were excluded.",65131e78-8681-493f-80da-f2a842ae9c1c
19,methods19," Using model II, PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) scores were entered at the first step (p < 0.001) and seemed to be the most powerful factor influencing the HS Sartorius score, explaining 30.4% of HS Sartorius score variability, while the other variables (while n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and ox-LDL) were excluded. The results of the two models are shown in Table 7.  4. Discussion The novel findings of this cross-sectional, case-controlled, observational study are the associations between the clinical severity of HS with PhA, a marker of cell membrane integrity, and with nutritional status, in particular the degree of adherence to the MD. Our data demonstrates that PhA was smaller and the adherence to the MD was lower in HS patients than in control subjects. Moreover, both the associations were independent of gender, age, body mass index (BMI), and total energy intake. Based on receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, PhA ≤ 5.",8ee79e7e-9139-4d35-8984-ba3d1c1b3fd0
20,methods20,"7° and a PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score of ≤ 5.0 identified HS patients who presented with the highest clinical severity of the disease. Consistently, we found that HS patients presented significant differences in other bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameters indicative of an inflammatory/catabolic status and exhibited a pro-inflammatory dietary pattern, with a lower intake of complex carbohydrate, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and a higher intake of saturated fatty acid (SFA) and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than controls.  HS is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease with a multifactorial pathogenesis. HS develops through interplay of genetic, immunological, endocrine and environmental risk factors, including obesity [12], body composition [24,25], and diet [27]. In particular, both Romaní et al. and Miller et al.",5baa6fdf-42b6-403c-817e-9dbc240e5278
21,methods21," reported that subjects with HS and healthy controls showed differences in FM analyzed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), irrespective of their body mass index (BMI), with higher FM in HS patients than in healthy controls [24,25]. In this context, higher FM may indicate an altered status of inflammatory homeostasis in adipose tissue that can amplify the morbidity in HS patients. Nevertheless, as a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) volumetric approach provides an indirect estimate of FM, FM could be both over- and under-estimated due to minimal variations of soft tissues hydration that might induce errors in the equations used in conventional bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), for the prediction of body composition [56,57].",b4971597-bbe2-4cdc-9ca7-2a3ade5b82c3
22,methods22," Contrariwise, the PhA, which is derived from raw bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements such as R and Xc, is considered to be valid in conditions with altered hydration status, as in chronic skin inflammation, such as psoriasis, obesity, and chronic inflammation [35,58,59] and the advantages of using the raw bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements, including PhA, have been also recently emphasized [60]. In both these studies, PhA was not included among the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameters of body composition, and the nutritional assessment was not performed.  PhA, a parameter obtained from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) direct measures, such as R and Xc, is widely used as a marker of cellular health [61]. Consequently, PhA is considered a reliable predictor of mortality and morbidity in several diseases [58].",a8ff845d-5c3f-4332-8ca4-f6a5faf6e75b
23,methods23," In a healthy population, a number of different factors may affect PhA, including diet, sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and inflammatory status [62]. PhA indicates the integrity [63] of a large number of cell membranes and the water distribution in body fluids [64]. Thus, PhA is positively associated with the body cell mass [65] and negatively associated with extra cellular water (ECW)/intra cellular water (ICW) ratio [66]. In line with other studies in different chronic inflammatory diseases [58], and our previous study in psoriatic patients [35], in this study we evidenced that a small PhA were correlated also with the clinical severity of HS, and we hypothesized the inflammatory milieu could account for this association in our group of HS patients.",2e7dd6bb-f078-45cc-9c50-0e56883c7019
24,methods24," Of interest, among all bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements, PhA was the main predictor of the clinical severity of HS, while R and Xc showed no correlations after adjusting for sex, age, body mass index (BMI) and total energy intake, likely due to the link of PhA with either the capacitive behavior of tissues (Xc) associated with cellularity, cell size, and integrity of the cell membrane, and its pure resistive behavior (R), mainly dependent on tissue hydration [19]. The identification of prognostic factors for HS patients could play a critical role in both the clinical management and the adequate monitoring of the clinical course of the disease.  As in psoriatic patients, we found that HS patients, compared to the control group, had also a lower adherence to the MD.",54b5319e-a525-4ab4-9568-d0f63aa3d6ed
25,methods25," In addition, by carefully evaluating their dietary assessment, HS patients consumed higher amounts of simple carbohydrates, total fat, food with a higher n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)s ratio, and lower complex carbohydrates, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and fiber. The association of diet with the clinical severity of HS has been previously reported. In particular, Danby investigated to the possible role of dairy food on HS disease and it reported that 83% of the 47 patients that underwent a dairy-free diet clinically improved compared to the control group without diet restriction [28]. In addition, Cannistrà et al. reported that in 12 patients with HS, a controlled brewer’s yeast-free diet for 12 months was effective in reducing the clinical severity of HS with a rapid stabilization of the dermatologic manifestation [29].",6e2a9237-4555-4850-b526-abc2f5a901e7
26,methods26,"  Very recently, we reported in healthy subjects, an association between the degree of the adherence to the PhA and MD, independently of sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) [34]. This association has been attributed to the high content of different beneficial compounds, such as antioxidants and polyphenols, found in plant foods, fruit and red wine, which are largely present in Mediterranean foods [67]. In particular, Mediterranean meal plans exhibit anti-inflammatory potential based on ox-LDL levels [68], a marker of oxidative stress, closely involved in the process of chronic inflammation. Consistently, in our sample of HS patients, ox-LDL levels presented a negative correlation the adherence to the MD and a positive correlation with the clinical severity of HS, thereby supporting the potential role of the MD in the integrated management of the HS patients.",5bce0043-3f02-4213-a683-26248a6324e6
27,methods27,"  The main limitations of the study were the following: First, the cross-sectional design of this study did not allow the determination of a causal association between MD and HS or to draw a final conclusion on the prognostic value of the degree of adherence to the MD in the prediction of clinical severity of HS. Further, there was not a normal weight control group matched by age and gender which did not allow a more consistent analysis of the associations detected in this study. Although body weight could have influenced the nutritional behavior in this study, the clinical severity of HS with PhA was associated with the degree of adherence to the MD after correction for body mass index (BMI). Moreover, the cut-off value of the PhA and of PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) scores suggested in our present study for predicting the clinical severity of HS, should be considered with caution until large studies are available to perform an appropriate cross-validation.",7f874c5e-c957-4b61-ad85-c7efe6dd990a
28,methods28," In addition, although in this study we based the analysis on raw bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements rather than bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) volumetric parameters, the evaluation of free fat mass (FFM) and FM was not validated by gold standard reference methods, such as dual-X ray absorptiometry, and expert nutritionists are mandatory for execution and especially for the assessment of the nutritional status and the interpretation of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements, in particular PhA. Nevertheless, considering the low prevalence of HS [3,4,5,6,7], strengths of our study include the relatively large sample of HS patients and the diagnosis of HS that was clinically evaluated and not self-reported; moreover, this study has adequate statistical power, included only naive-treatment patients and both HS patients and matched controls have been well characterized.",c96da4c3-1de7-40f2-bf37-adaac1d6d36d
29,methods29," Finally, the nutritional status has been adequately assessed by using the 7-day food records, the gold standard among food frequency questionnaires [31].  5. Conclusions In conclusion, we reported a novel association between the clinical severity of HS with PhA, a marker of cell membrane integrity, and with nutritional status, in particular the degree of adherence to the MD. Specific cut-off values for the PhA and the degree of adherence to the MD could be included as an auxiliary tool in the complex dermatological evaluation of the clinical severity in patients with HS, contributing to identify those patients who could get additional benefit from careful dietary interventions. Our study underlines the role of the nutrition assessment as a predictive tool in HS patients. A growing cooperation between nutritionists and dermatologist might provide a combination key in the complex management of the HS patients.",4f0f42ac-d802-40b4-9ba8-fe4740f3b18b
30,methods30," Further studies on a large population with HS and intervention trials are warranted to support the association of PhA and the adherence to the MD with the clinical severity of HS, and to highlight the potential anti-inflammatory effects of the MD on in HS patients.
