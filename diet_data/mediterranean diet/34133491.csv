Among them, two groups of subjects with a long and healthy life expectancy, referred to as Long Lived Subjects (LLS) (17 centenarians (CENT) and 29 NON) were compared to 46 younger CTLs. In addition, the contribution of genetics to the GM phenotype was assessed by comparing a subgroup of seven centenarian parents (CPAR) with a paired cohort of the centenarians’ offspring (COFF).  Cases and controls, matched by gender, were recruited in the study by the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health of the University Hospital of Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy). As for inclusion criteria, the groups consisted of Sardinian subjects aged ≥ 100 and ≥ 90 for centenarians (CENT) and NON groups, respectively, and aged between 40 and 60 for CTLs.",d319faa1-a5ba-4a90-bfb8-a1faca5d5ade

Functional Metagenome Prediction Analysis  A comparative prediction analysis of the functional metagenome was performed using PICRUSt. A total of three different significantly metabolic pathways were identified by comparing centenarians (CENT) and NON (see Figure 4A). In particular, the pathway related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (tropane, piperidine and pyridine alkaloid) were most expressed in centenarians (CENT), while the pathways related to lipid metabolism (Ether lipid metabolism) and amino acid metabolism (D-Arginine and D-ornithine metabolism) were enriched in NON.",81d3d20b-9299-4747-9fb6-d266d414942e

In centenarians (CENT) the bacterial secretion system and the pathway of replication, recombination and reparation of proteins were also most expressed compared to CTLs; on the other hand, the metabolism of pyrimidine, amino and nucleotide sugar was reduced.  Comparing the functional metagenome prediction profile of NON and CTLs has shown that in the former, a significant decrease in starch and sucrose metabolism was observed, whereas in the latter, a reduction in transporters and ABC transporter pathways was found.",5de90de3-a449-445c-85ba-3d760d82bdd6

Discussion  The present study aimed at characterizing human GM and its functional profile in two groups of Sardinian subjects with long, healthy lifespans (17 centenarians (CENT) and 29 NON) by comparing them to 46 younger CTLs. In addition, the contribution of genetics and environmental factors to the GM phenotype was assessed by comparing a subgroup of centenarian parents (centenarian parents (CPAR)) with a paired cohort of centenarians’ offspring (centenarians’ offspring (COFF)). The analysis was performed through Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S bacterial rRNA gene on the MiSeq Illumina platform.  The alpha diversity in centenarians (CENT) and NON was higher than in CTLs, although no significant difference in the Shannon index was observed.",6f0dc9b9-53a2-4c08-9617-7ed3aed8cb94
24,methods24," These data confirm previous studies’ results, as the literature agrees on a greater alpha diversity being associated with aging among elderly and extremely elderly adults; however, findings are not always statistically significant [56,57].  Beta diversity analysis showed a significant dissimilarity between both groups of long-lived subjects (centenarians (CENT) and NON) compared to CTLs, as previously reported [19,43,58,59].  Our microbial diversity findings represent a strong indicator of GM implications in advanced aging, in agreement with previous hypotheses. In fact, greater alpha diversity in both centenarians (CENT) and NON cohorts compared to healthy controls reflects a rich and complex microbial ecosystem, indicative of an adaptable intestinal microbiota, capable of adapting to multiple environmental perturbations. Due to this peculiarity, high intestinal microbial diversity has been defined as an indicator of longevity [60].",11d25262-bdae-483f-b9e2-afd7defbc148
25,methods25,"  We also observed a statistically significant reduction in the alpha diversity of centenarians (CENT) compared to NON. It should be pointed out that lower alpha diversity has been associated with poor cognitive function [61], in line with a significantly lower Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) score in the centenarians (CENT) cohort compared to NON. Furthermore, although the centenarians (CENT) cohort represents a healthy population, during aging, and especially in advanced aging, a physiological reduction in gastrointestinal function and host immune response has been observed linked to the development of chronic low-grade inflammation [6]. In this regard, it has been observed that reduced alpha diversity is related to metabolic and inflammatory diseases [62,63]. Therefore, a reduction in alpha diversity in centenarians (CENT) compared to NON is not surprising.",0c89fac2-d989-4cba-bc21-88b78561456c
26,methods26,"  At the taxonomic level, we observed a significant increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in both centenarians (CENT) and NON groups compared to CTLs, in contrast to previous studies on centenarian subjects with the same [43] or a different geographic origin [36] and also to studies on the elderly [9,64]. Notably, among our centenarians (CENT), NON and CTLs cohorts, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was approximately the same and did not change significantly (40.54, 47.72 and 43.15, respectively; p = 0.387), while that of Bacteroidetes almost doubled in CTLs compared to centenarians (CENT) and NON groups (43.59, 24.74 and 25.28, respectively; pcentenarians (CENT)vsCTLs = 0.015 pNONvsCTLs = 0.022). In other words, the higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in our long-living subjects compared to controls reflected a significant reduction in the relative abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum, rather than an increase in that of Firmicutes.",cd8c265c-2ae9-4f45-b940-8a8eb9c8b501
27,methods27,"  Multilevel taxonomic analysis showed greater divergences between Long Lived Subjects (LLS) and CTLs, while the GM composition between centenarians (CENT) and NON did not diverge considerably. Specifically, more statistically significant differences (n = 41 taxa) were found between NON and CTLs. Twenty-four taxa significantly diverged when comparing centenarians (CENT) to CTLs, while twenty-nine common taxa in both centenarians (CENT) and NON were significantly altered compared to CTLs. Lastly, only eight bacterial taxa were significantly altered when comparing centenarians (CENT) to NON. This demonstrates that the GMs of the older cohorts are more similar to each other than to the cohort of younger subjects.",5bae38d6-f03b-48c4-8acb-273dae5e5fb1
28,methods28,"  LEfSe showed that the Verrucomicrobia phylum was identified as the main biomarker in centenarians (CENT), together with its members Verrucomicrobiaceae, Akkermansia and Akkermansia muciniphila, as often reported in previous studies of centenarians [57,65,66], while one study observed an opposite trend [64]. In addition, Akkermansia has been reported to increase with aging in several studies [6]. Akkermansia muciniphila is a mucin degrading bacterium that resides in the human intestinal mucous layer and is able of promoting intestinal integrity due to its capacity for restoring mucous thickness and thus stimulating the mucous turnover rate [67,68]. It is considered a significant biomarker of intestinal homeostasis, as its depletion has been associated with many diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic disorders [69]. Several studies confirm its protective effects. A.",233697eb-65d0-46c6-87f6-77141da718b1

A. muciniphila supplementation in patients with overweight/obesity has reduced inflammation marker levels and improved several metabolic parameters [74], while in animal models of diabetes and obesity, it has restored the integrity of the epithelial mucosa, improved glucose tolerance and improved metabolic parameters, such as endotoxemia and inflammation [75].",1bd1030f-17de-4fe8-bd41-7854bc878fb8
30,methods30,"  Other strongly associated taxa in centenarians (CENT) were the Synergistaceae family, which belong to the Synergistetes phylum, Eggerthella, Collinsella intestinalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum (Actinobacteria), Methanobrevibacter and Methanobrevibacter smithii (Euryarchaeota phylum), as well as Rikenellaceae and Prevotella within the Bacteroidetes phylum. These associations are consistent with previous studies in which an increase in the abundance of all these taxa, with the exception of Prevotella, was observed in centenarians compared to younger subjects [19,43,58,66].",1023ad0f-b53c-478b-b51e-c8d77d7582ae

32,methods32," For instance, Bifidobacterium bifidum constitutes one of the most dominant taxa of human intestinal microbiota in healthy breast-fed infants [76] and it has been individuated as one of the most abundant Bifidobacteria species in Italian centenarians [77].  Bacteroides intestinalis is able to degrade complex arabinoxylans from dietary fibre with the consequent release of the beneficial ferulic acid metabolite. It has been demonstrated that cultured Bacteroides intestinalis in the presence of complex insoluble arabinoxylans enhances the Th1-type immune response in mice and exerts anti-inflammatory activity in dendritic cells under inflammatory conditions [78].  Phascolarctobacterium is an acetate/propionate-producer, whose increase, observed after treatment with berberine and metformin in high-fat diet-induced obesity in rats, has been hypothesized to contribute to the beneficial effects of these two drugs [79].",9c026b7b-81cf-4d5d-bf2d-14244c9097e3
33,methods33," Phascolarctobacterium faecium exerted beneficial effects on the host in rat models with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [80], and has been associated with the supplementation of cruciferous vegetables in a controlled fruit and vegetable-free diet [81].  Regarding the Euryarchaeota phylum, the Methanobacteriaceae family and its members, Methanobrevibacter and Methanobrevibacter smithii, were strongly associated with centenarians (CENT). These data are in agreement with previous studies that reported a high abundance of Methanobrevibacter smithii and of Methanobrevibacter genus in the centenarian gut microbiota of Sardinian and Chinese subjects, respectively [43,82]. Methanobrevibacter smithii represents the most dominant methanogen in the human gut due to its ability to reduce CO2 by using H2 (or formate) [83].",c0d69090-d1c5-4487-abd1-b8657c4bfd25
34,methods34," Several studies have investigated the possible link between the presence of methanogens and some human diseases, such as colorectal cancers (colorectal cancers (CRC)), inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)), irritable bowel syndrome (irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)), obesity and constipation, although contradictory findings make them difficult to interpret [83]. However, the mutualistic activity of M. smithii and B. thetaiotaomicron, inoculated into a germ-free mice model, has shown to promote an increase in caloric intake from diets, in lipogenesis and in host fat [84]. Noteworthy is the relationship between methanogens and aging, based on the excreting methane breath test, which has been consistently observed [83]. This association has not yet been defined, but different hypotheses have been formulated.",fa3315d5-1208-4229-b72d-3559b2402602
35,methods35," Among them, the possibility that methanogens are selected during aging for their insensitivity to most of the antibiotics used throughout a lifespan, their slower transit time observed in aging, which possibly contributes to their over-representation, and favorable environmental exposure to methanogens in extreme long-living subjects during their life compared to current adults (different dietary habits, exposure to livestock) [83].  In NON, the strongest associations observed concerned the Actinobacteria phylum and related members Bifidobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium angulatum, Bifidobacterium asteroides, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium choerinum, Bifidobacterium indicum and Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense. It should be pointed out that the abundance of these taxa was elevated in NON compared with CTLs and underwent a slight decrease in extreme longevity (centenarians (CENT)) compared with NON, albeit still higher than in CTLs.",030ad13a-267e-4d7a-b72b-8662e097d02c
36,methods36," Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that Bifidobacteria and its species diversity are decreased in elderlies [85]. Consistent with our findings, higher proportions have been identified in successful aging compared to younger elderlies or younger adult [14,43,86,87]. A reduction in Bifidobacteria has been associated with impaired adhesion to the intestinal mucosa, but it remains to be clarified whether the cause is attributable to changes in the mucus structure in the microbiota of elderly subjects [85]. Furthermore, Bifidobacteria depletion has been correlated with enhanced susceptibility to infections and impaired intestinal activity [88].  A strong association in NON was also found for Lactobacillaceae, Lactobacillus and Lactobacillus spp., which all belong to the Firmicutes phylum.  The probiotic effect of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium taxa has been well documented [89]. It has been demonstrated that Lactobacillus spp. or Bifidobacterium spp.",0ac4eff2-5ff2-4e09-94b0-d782eb62ade3
37,methods37," probiotic supplementation attenuates oxidative stress and inflammation and improves physiological parameters such as gut barrier function, learning and memory ability in aged mice [90]. In addition, improved immunity in elderly humans and aged mice has been observed [91].  The taxa Streptococcaceae, Streptococcus, Streptococcus spp., Veillonellaceae, Veillonella, Veillonella dispar, Veillonella atypica, Thermicanaceae, Thermicanus, Bacillales_Family X_Incertae Sedis (Firmicutes phylum), Desulfovibrionaceae, Desulfovibrio, Desulfovibrio piger (Proteobacteria) and Bacteroides fragilis (Bacteroidetes) were also strongly associated with NON. Veillonella species are known to use lactic acid as a source of carbon and energy and are believed to ferment the lactic acid produced by Streptococcus, derived from the fermentation of carbohydrates [92], and positively correlates with the abundance of Streptococcus in irritable bowel syndrome (irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)) [93,94].",eb8f23be-b9b4-420e-a8e1-c20e10a96399
38,methods38," Furthermore, this bacterial genus has the ability to ferment organic acids through the production of propionic and acetic acids, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The propionic acid produced by Veillonella potentially presents greater risks than benefits regarding the neurotoxic character linked to its accumulation [95,96].  As for Desulfovibrio bacteria, it has been demonstrated, using a Stress-Induced Premature Senescence Model of Bmi-1 Deficiency, that mice in whom this bacterial genus penetrated the epithelium underwent an induced TNF-α secretion by macrophages, which caused impairment of TNF-α-dependent intestinal barrier permeability and aging. Furthermore, Desulfovibrio, one of the predominant sulphate-reducing bacterial generates residing in the human gut, is capable of leading to the formation of hydrogen sulfide, which is toxic for intestinal epithelial cells and exerts a pro-inflammatory effect.",c828d793-3739-4ba0-bb12-15d88439935a
39,methods39," In fact, its abundance has been correlated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) [97,98] and obesity [29].  In CTLs, the strongest associations were related to the Bacteroidetes phylum and its members Bacteroidaceae, Bacteroides, Bacteroides spp. and the Prevotellaceae family. In the same cohort, the main biomarkers were taxa belonging to the Cyanobacteria phylum, such as Aphanizomenonaceae, Dolichospermum and Dolichospermum macrosporum, to Proteobacteria phylum (Alcaligenaceae, Comamonadaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, Collimonas, Candidatus Blochmannia, Candidatus Blochmannia rufipes, Sutterellaceae and Sutterella) and to the Firmicutes phylum, such as Acidaminococcus intestini, Erysipelothricaceae, Erysipelothrix, Erysipelothrix inopinata, Butyrivibrio and Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus.",16d5b61c-37d5-43bb-820b-7bf441246e32
40,methods40,"  The association with the Bacteroidetes phylum was in line with previous studies [19,77,99] and disagrees with the initial hypothesis concerning the increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes in old age, and with the reduction of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in older adults [6,64]. It should be borne in mind that the harmonic balance between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla in the human microbiota can be indicative of good health, but it is subject to the influence of lifestyle factors. The significant reduction in Bacteroidetes in both centenarians (CENT) and NON subjects compared to CTLs could be explained by the significantly higher BMI in these cohorts than in controls, given that Bacteroidetes are known to positively correlate with a reduction in body fat [29].",16653ceb-eab3-47f8-a0d5-04c7edf51c36
41,methods41," Furthermore, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes has been shown to be substantially accentuated as a consequent exercise intervention in an early obesity and NAFLD model and in controls, compared with corresponding untrained group [100]. It should be pointed out that our Long Lived Subjects (LLS) cohorts, mainly centenarians (CENT), had a low Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score, which indicates a sedentary lifestyle, consistent with a reduction in the Bacteroidetes phylum in these subjects compared to controls.  Taxa significantly associated with longevity were correlated with dietary, lifestyle and clinical variables in both centenarians (CENT) and NON. Most taxa associated with centenarians (CENT) were correlated with DMS score and bowel function. As for the former, most of the bacteria belonged to the Firmicutes phylum.",7c241e06-c979-4b69-8975-52fd3769dfd7
42,methods42," Specifically, taxa belonging to the Clostridiaceae (Clostridium), Lachnospiraceae (Dorea), Peptostreptococcaceae (Peptoniphilus) and Thermicanaceae (Thermicanus) families positively correlated with DMS scores. The Clostridiaceae family has been associated with increased dietary fibers in rodent models [101], responding to dietary carbohydrates. Interestingly, fiber represents one of the nutrients with a beneficial impact evaluated for the attribution of adherence score to the Mediterranean diet [50]. Clostridium species can ferment carbohydrates, proteins, organic acids, and other organics, and produce acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid (SCFAs) and some solvents, such as acetone and butanol. SCFAs and most of the metabolites they produce, such as bile acids (BAs), proteins and other metabolic substances, bring many benefits to gut health [102]. As for Dorea, its ability to produce SCFAs from vegetables has been reported [103].",6aa94b41-ebf6-4d79-8a5d-fef8b0fe998d
43,methods43," In centenarians (CENT), Catenibacterium correlated negatively with DMS scores. This bacterial genus belongs to the Erysipelotrichidae family (Firmicutes), which has been associated with high fat diets in humans and in rodent models [104,105] and with inflammation-related intestinal disease and metabolic disorders [106], although a subsequent study observed an increase related to their diets [107] in a group of Egyptian adolescents compared to US Children.  In regard to bowel function, eight bacterial taxa were positively correlated, and one was negatively correlated. The positively correlated taxa mostly belonged to the Firmicutes phylum (Thermicanaceae, Thermicanus, E. inopinata), but also included Desulfohalobiaceae, Desulfonauticus, D. autotrophicus (Proteobacteria) and the Synergistetes phylum, with its Synergistaceae family. The taxa negatively correlated with bowel function belonged to the Firmicutes phylum (L. taiwanensis).",6e7a9a24-e131-4e87-9573-8b8b1e0da8c2
44,methods44," Further studies are needed to clarify the significance of these correlations with the intestinal function of the study subjects, given that, to our knowledge, the literature does not describe the physiological implications of these taxa on human health. Diet may mediate some of these correlations, as Thermicanaceae and Thermicanus are positively associated with both DM and bowel function.  In centenarians (CENT), Desulfovibrio negatively correlated with Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) and Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) scores and to former alcohol consumption. D. piger negatively correlated with Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) and Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) scores. This data is not surprising, given the pro-inflammatory implications of these taxa (discussed above).  In NON there was a greater number of correlations with DMS, to the number of medications and to Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score.",a248d40d-af22-429d-aa1b-b40a0737a832
45,methods45," Members belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum were all negatively correlated to DMS score (Bifidobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium, Bifidobacterium spp., Streptomycetaceae), as well as those belonging to Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides clarus) and Firmicutes (Lactobacillus ultunensis), whereas others belonging to Bacteroidetes (Odoribacteraceae, Bacteroides dorei, Pedobacter kwangyangensis and Parabacteroides spp.), Firmicutes (Alkaliphilus, Clostridium frigoris, Lactobacillus ultunensis, Peptoniphilus) and Proteobacteria (Bilophila and Bilophila wadsworthia) were positively correlated. Taxa belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum, such as Bifidobacterium, Bifidobacterium spp., Blautia wexlerae (Firmicutes) and Bacteroidaceae (Bacteroidetes phylum) were negatively correlated with the number of medications, while the Bacteroidetes phylum (and related Bacteroides, Bacteroides spp., Sphingobacterium shayense) and Alcaligenaceae and Sutterella (Proteobacteria phylum) showed positive correlations.",d735d62f-605e-4f04-a1aa-a856da86f343
46,methods46," Several significant associations have also been found for other clinical variables, such as Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score and Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) scores. Taxa belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum (Serratia, S. entomophila, Escherichia, E. albertii) and Eggerthella (Actinobacteria) were inversely related to Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scores; however, in relation to Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score, Firmicutes members (Thermicanaceae, Thermicanus, Blautia wexlerae) on one hand, and Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria members on the other, showed positive and negative correlations, respectively.  We performed a comparative prediction analysis of the functional metagenome using PICRUSt.  It was previously observed that older adults and long-lived subjects have reduced pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid synthesis [6].",006855fd-d40a-4c39-8485-7b542cd63d36
47,methods47," It should be pointed out that, with aging, dietary habits change due to a reduction in appetite, loss of teeth, decrease in gustatory perception and decreased efficiency of the digestive system, which results in a reduction in the absorption of essential nutrients [6]. In this regard, we observed a depletion in glycan metabolism in both centenarians (CENT) and NON, and a reduction of starch and sucrose metabolism (carbohydrate degradation related pathway) in NON. This result agrees with a previous study carried out on a group of subjects recruited in the same territory (Sardinia, Italy), in which a reduction of pathways related to carbohydrate degradation was observed compared to elderly and younger subjects [43]. In our study cohort, this finding is of particular interest in the light of the contextual reduction of the Bacteroidetes phylum in both centenarians (CENT) and NON.",776b399c-3f8f-404d-bb22-f03abef20446
48,methods48," In fact, Bacteroidetes encode more carbohydrate-degrading enzymes than Firmicutes (more representative than Bacteroidetes in our long-lived cohorts) and possess a lesser number of ABC carbohydrate transporters. Genes encoding ABC transporters specific for glycans are often located adjacent to those encoding glycoside hydrolases (with which they are co-expressed) in Firmicutes but not in Bacteroidetes; this might be a glycan acquisition strategy that Firmicutes have evolved [108]. Furthermore, ABC transporters are involved in the transport of a variety of substrates, including nutrients, toxins, antibiotics and xenobiotics [109]. NON showed a significant increase in ABC transporter expression, which may be related to more frequent use of medications in this cohort.",e31012ae-fbd6-435a-8098-0d26fc626422
49,methods49,"  Another noteworthy finding of our research is the significant increase in the two-component system pathway in both centenarians (CENT) and NON compared to CTLs, which points out the greater adaptability of the long-lived intestinal microbial ecosystem compared to that of younger subjects. Two-component signal transduction systems represent a means of communication through which bacteria perceive and respond to their environment, including stress conditions, nutrient availability, quorum signals, chemokines, pH and other factors [110]. It is a strategy developed by bacteria to adapt their cellular physiology to changes in the environment. The importance of such a sophisticated signaling mechanism justifies their prevalence throughout the bacterial kingdom [111].",ae0ecafe-cbbc-4e41-8531-2af2d51196a0
50,methods50,"  Assuming that the microbial phenotypic patterns observed in our cohort of centenarians were peculiar and/or predisposing to the state of longevity, we hypothesized that they were not significantly divergent in terms of abundance from those of the paired centenarian’s offspring cohort, considering both genetic and environmental effects as predisposing factors for the state of longevity. As expected, centenarian parents (CPAR) and centenarians’ offspring (COFF) differed significantly only in five bacterial taxa, which lost statistical significance following Bonferroni’s post-hoc correction. In centenarian parents (CPAR), we have observed a reduction in taxa belonging to the Firmicutes phylum, such as Faecalibacterium, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (Clostridiaceae) and Roseburia faecis (Lachnospiraceae), as well as a reduction in Bacteroides denticanum and Bacteroides plebeius, which belong to the Bacteroidetes phylum.",12bf8791-afc7-40f6-8fe9-58e493d4e2c6
51,methods51," Furthermore, no statistically significant differences in alpha and beta diversity, nor in metabolic function, between centenarian parents (CPAR) and centenarians’ offspring (COFF) were observed. These findings were not surprising and seemed to confirm our hypothesis. The genetic make-up and environmental factors, such as diet, geographical environment, type of residence, modality of childbirth or type of breastfeeding, act synergistically as a multifactorial cause in the modulation of GM. In fact, it should be noted that all subjects of our centenarians’ offspring (COFF) cohort were born through natural childbirth and were nursed with their mother’s milk and all, except one, lived in their own home and maintained an identical diet to that of their parents until adulthood. Moreover, their diet remained similar until before the sampling of the study.  5.",abca126f-a3ca-4954-9931-ae7d6d0496cd
52,methods52," Conclusions  In conclusion, long-lived subjects were more similar to each other than to younger controls and the greatest divergences, in terms of microbial composition, emerged from the comparison between nonagenarians and controls. Nonagenarians showed an increase in both anti and pro-inflammatory bacterial taxa compared to younger subjects. This is not entirely surprising, given that these are subjects in an advanced aging phase, thus subjects in whom the likelihood of successful extreme aging, as we see in centenaries, is unknown. In this context, a prospective analysis of the nonagenarian population might be useful in order to understand what intestinal microbial pattern would predispose a subject to reach the age of a hundred.  Our population of centenarians diverged less from younger subjects in term of bacterial taxa compared to NON.",2d86499e-ae43-4316-89c6-d98a029298e1
53,methods53," Overall, the main biomarkers associated with centenarians belonged to the Verrucomicrobia phylum, including the Akkermansia muciniphila species, considered to be a significant biomarker of gut homeostasis for its ability to promote intestinal integrity; at the same time, there is a significant increase in taxa with an anti-inflammatory phenotype, biomarkers of a state of health. This intestinal microbial ecosystem could guarantee intestinal health, which would then translate into the health of the whole organism.  The results deriving from the GM analysis of centenarians’ offspring suggest that genetics and environmental factors act synergistically as a multifactorial cause in the modulation of GM towards a phenotype similar to that of centenarians, although these findings need to be confirmed by larger study cohorts and by prospective studies in order to clarify whether such microbial phenotypic patterns are predisposing factors in longevity.
