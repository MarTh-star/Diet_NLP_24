0,methods0,"2.1. Participants A total of 194 male participants enrolled in three municipal football sport schools in the province of Toledo (region in the center of Spain) and successfully completed the study (age range: 8–16 years old; age average: 12 ± 2). The study was conducted during the academic period when participants attended extracurricular football training sessions two times per week. For participation in the study, we included all players whose parents/legal guardians authorized by informed consent the inclusion of their children or guardians. Coaches, parents, and players were previously informed about the purpose of the study and the nature of the tests that would be performed through an informative document. Players were evaluated individually on a single occasion during a day of training. All participants trained 2 days a week for at least two hours. Indeed, maturity is necessary for studies on the growth of children [25].",d5d96988-274a-4fab-9ef6-ae4909c526a0
1,methods1," Thus, all participants were divided into two groups depending on their pubertal status. A Marshall and Tanner test [26] was conducted for all participants. For this purpose, the sample was divided in prepubertal (n = 127) and pubertal (n = 67). This tool has been frequently used for the classification in different maturational stage in young and adolescent population [27]. It consists of 5 stages of pubic hair and testicular development in boys. According to these criteria, 2 groups were formed: prepubertal (Tanner I) and pubertal (Tanner II, III, and IV). The Tanner pubertal status was determined by self-assessment. This method correlated with a physician assessment of pubertal development. The researchers have been previously formed and gained experience in the use of this tool in previous studies. Furthermore, years and hours per week of planned out-of-school physical activity were registered.",4e9a1e0f-46d8-4a6c-923d-0ec5a69706e5
2,methods2,"  The study was conducted in adherence to the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 review, Brazil) following the European Community’s guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (111/3976/88 of July 1990), as well as the Spanish legal framework for clinical research on humans (Real Decretory 561/1993 on clinical trials). The informed consent and the study were approved by the Bioethics Committee for Clinical Research of the Virgen de la Salud Hospital of Toledo and by the supervisors of the University of Castilla-La Mancha (REF:508/14072020).  2.2. Measure  a   Anthropometric Parameters and Body Composition   An anthropometric assessment was carried out. A portable segmental analyzer of multifrequency body composition (Tanita MC-780, Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure weight (kg), body fat (%), and skeletal muscle mass (%). Furthermore, legs fat (%) and legs skeletal muscle mass (%) based on total weight for each leg were included.",1df17ef1-e86e-44dc-b785-094d5b91b22c
3,methods3," The body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated with the weight (kg) divided by the squared height of the participants. Height (cm) was measured with a stadiometer (Seca 214, Hamburg, Germany). Players were assessed with clothes and without shoes.  b   Physical Fitness   The different parameters of physical fitness were assessed following the protocols of the ALPHA health-related fitness battery [17]. All the participants were familiar with all physical performance tests as they had previously developed familiarization sessions in physical education classes.     First, cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated by the 20 mSRT. This maximum and progressive test measures the maximum cardiorespiratory fitness [28]. Players were required to run, in a straight line, between two lines distanced 20 m apart, while keeping a pace with the acoustic signals from a speakerphone audio player with Bluetooth technology. According to the protocol by Léger et al. [29], the initial speed was 8.",6e48dc39-ec1c-425f-9aa4-2ed5bccab5ed
4,methods4,"5 km·h−1, which was increased by 0.5 km·h−1 each min (1 min = one stage). The test was finished when the athletes failed to reach the end lines before the audio signal on two occasions or when stopped because of fatigue. Players were allowed to perform the test once. The total time in min was retained. The results are presented both in min (stage) and percentile adjusted by sex and age, based in the Eurofit reference values for Castilla-La Mancha [30]. This test was performed at the end of the evaluation sessions, so that fatigue did not interfere with the other tests. The results of this test were used to divide the sample into two subgroups in relation to the level of cardiorespiratory fitness. For this, all participants with a result equal to or greater than the 75th percentile (≥P75) for their age were classified as having a good level of cardiorespiratory fitness and the rest as having a low level (<P75) [31].",4d37605b-94e9-4b73-aa33-4aa21ae22309
5,methods5,"  Respiratory capacity was recorded through forced spirometry which is a physiological test that measures how a subject inhales or exhales volumes of air as a function of time [32]. Each of the players performed a maximum inspiration using a spirometer, no more than two seconds of apnea, and a maximum expiration until there is no air left in the lungs. The most important aspects of spirometry are the forced vital capacity (forced vital capacity (FVC)), which is the volume delivered during an expiration made as forcefully and completely as possible starting from full inspiration, and the forced expiratory volume (forced expiratory volume (FEV)) in one second, which is the volume delivered in the first second of an forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuver [33]. Other spirometric variables were also assessed and included in the analysis. Two measurements were implemented for each participant and the best measurement was preserved.",b78147a6-39be-473b-87b2-78c95ebe1639
6,methods6,"  To evaluate the upper-body muscular strength, the handgrip strength test (kg) was applied using a dynamometer with an adjustable grip (TKK 5001 Grip A; Tokyo, Japan). Players had to continuously tighten the grip for 2 s with the elbow position in full extension. The test was repeated twice (right hand and left hand, alternately). The best score of the two attempts for each player was chosen to the nearest 1 g [17]. The results are presented both in kg and percentile adjusted by sex and age, based on the Eurofit reference values for Castilla-La Mancha [30].   c   Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet   In order to determine the adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the existence of possible eating disorders, the KIDMED questionnaire was used. This test, previously validated, consists of 16 items where twelve items represent a positive score for the adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the remaining 4 items represent a negative score [33].",0a41d0d0-28c2-419f-aeaf-e3089ebab0bd
7,methods7," A positive answer to a question that involves greater adherence to the diet is worth +1 point. A positive answer to a question that means less adherence to the diet is worth –1 point. Negative answers do not score (a value of 0 is noted). The KIDMED index is the sum of all the scores and ranges from 0 to 12 points (minimum to maximum adherence to the Mediterranean diet). The adherence to the Mediterranean diet could be categorized as low adherence (very low-quality diet, 0–3), medium adherence (improvement of the diet is needed, 4–7), and high adherence (ideal adherence to the Mediterranean diet, 8–12) [33]. However, in this study, the total score (KIDMED index) was used as scale variable [34].     2.3. Statistical Analysis Data are presented as means ± standard deviations. All data were statistically analyzed using SPSS V24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.",8e60eca5-b271-423c-9b85-b5ca719d0b20
8,methods8," Before carrying out the analyses, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov distribution test was performed to confirm a normal distribution of the variables. Differences between groups were evaluated through two-way ANOVA (prepubertal vs. pubertal and <P75 cardiorespiratory fitness vs. ≥P75 cardiorespiratory fitness). All anthropometric measurements, respiratory variables, handgrip strength, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet were used as dependent variables. Post-hoc analysis was adjusted by the Bonferroni method. Furthermore, Effect sizes (Cohen’s d, ES) were calculated and defined as follows: trivial, <0.19; small, 0.2–0.49; medium, 0.5–0.79; large, >0.8 [35].  3. Results Table 1 shows the descriptive data of the participants (anthropometric variables, body composition, respiratory capacity, cardiorespiratory fitness, handgrip strength, and KIDMED index).  The results showed significant differences between the maturational stage in all variables (p < 0.",0f792010-4b73-4398-89e4-9a11525eeb94
9,methods9,"05), except forced expiratory volume (FEV)1/forced vital capacity (FVC), handgrip percentile and KIDMED index, and significant differences between cardiorespiratory fitness level in weight, body mass index (BMI), total body fat, total muscle mass, as well as fat mass and muscle mass in both legs (p < 0.05). However, interaction effects between the combinations of both factors were found in all variables (p < 0.05), except forced expiratory volume (FEV)1/forced vital capacity (FVC) and KIDMED index. Therefore, post-hoc pairwise comparisons are presented in Table 2 and Table 3.  Table 2 presents the results in relation to body composition variables. Prepubertal players showed significant lower weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) than pubertal players in both cardiorespiratory fitness levels (p < 0.05; ES from 0.41 to 1.92).",e65caf9d-c663-4159-9225-3c36ec74d4b5
10,methods10," Furthermore, significant differences between cardiorespiratory fitness levels were found in weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) in the prepubertal group (p < 0.05; ES from 0.44 to 1.07); however, only differences in body mass index (BMI) were found in the pubertal group (p = 0.018; IC: 1.74 to 3.81; ES: 0.57).  Prepubertal players showed a significantly higher percentage of total body fat (24.50%) compared to pubertal players (21.93%) in the <P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group (p = 0.018; Confidence Interval (CI): 0.45 to 4.71; Effect Size (ES): 0.42). Furthermore, a significantly lower percentage of total muscle mass was registered in the prepubertal group (71.45%) compared to the pubertal group (74.03%), as well as in the <P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group (p = 0.012; CI: −4.51 to −0.57; ES: 0.45). However, no significant differences in total body fat or total muscle mass were found between the maturational stage groups in the ≥P75 cardiorespiratory fitness level (p > 0.05).",5148a140-3a7f-442d-8d49-aada15ceb06c
11,methods11," On the other hand, players with <P75 cardiorespiratory fitness revealed a higher percentage of total body fat in the prepubertal group (24.50%) and pubertal group (21.39%) compared to players with ≥P75 cardiorespiratory fitness (pubertal: 19.87%; prepubertal: 17.88%) with medium to large effect sizes (p < 0.001; CI: 2.74 to 6.53; ES: 0.90 for the prepubertal group and p = 0.004; IC: 1.32 to 6.78; ES: 0.77 for the pubertal group). Opposite differences were found for total muscle mass, where the <P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group presented significantly lower values than ≥P75 both in prepubertal and pubertal groups (p < 0.01; ES: 0.77 to 0.88).  Regarding the data obtained from the lower extremities of the players, the prepubertal group revealed a higher percentage of fat mass and a lower percentage of muscle mass in both legs and in both cardiorespiratory fitness levels (p < 0.05; ES: 0.54 to 0.93).",98068221-938d-4faf-8bf3-702c6753cbac
12,methods12," The <P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group showed a significantly higher percentage of fat mass and a lower percentage of muscle mass than the ≥P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group in pubertal participants (p < 0.05; ES: 0.47 to 0.67). However, in prepubertal participants only, significant differences were found in the fat mass percentage (p < 0.05; ES: 0.76 to 0.79).  Table 3 presents the results in relation to respiratory variables, handgrip strength, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Prepubertal players showed significantly lower values in all respiratory variables except forced expiratory volume (FEV)1/forced vital capacity (FVC) (p < 0.05; ES: 0.44 to 2.12). forced vital capacity (FVC) presented higher values in the <P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group (2.82 l) than in the ≥P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group (2.48 l) in prepubertal players (p = 0.005; IC: 0.11 to 0.58; ES: 0.57).",aa73cd54-5cc5-4092-916c-64d64465b172
13,methods13," Conversely, forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume (FEV)1 showed lower values in the <P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group (forced vital capacity (FVC): 3.66 l and forced expiratory volume (FEV)1: 3.14 l) than in the ≥P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group (forced vital capacity (FVC): 4.02 l and forced expiratory volume (FEV)1: 3.56 l) in pubertal players (p = 0.044; IC: −0.70 to −0.01; ES: 0.43 for forced vital capacity (FVC) and p = 0.006; IC: −0.73 to 1.13; ES: 0.63 for FV1).  The prepubertal group evidenced significantly lower values of handgrip strength than the pubertal group in all variables, except handgrip strength (percentile) in the ≥P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group (p < 0.01; ES: 0.69 to 1.78). Handgrip strength (kg) presented higher values in the <P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group (23.21 kg) than in the ≥P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group (19.80 kg) in prepubertal players (p = 0.013; IC: 0.72 to 6.09; ES: 0.49).",c9d50d05-0513-4dde-a18d-b8bb5bd01351
14,methods14,"  No significant differences were found in the KIDMED index, although effect sizes close to medium are found, with a higher index in the ≥P75 cardiorespiratory fitness group both in pubertal participants (ES: 0.41).  Finally, Table 4 shows the results of the influence of different variables on cardiorespiratory fitness. In addition to age, percentage of muscle mass and forced vital capacity (FVC) have a positive and significant relationship with stages of 20 mSRT, while body mass index (BMI) has a negative and significant relationship (p < 0.05). Handgrip strength (kg) and the KIDMED index show a positive reaction, although it is not significant (p > 0.05).  4. Discussion The results of this study suggested that there are differences in anthropometric, respiratory, physical fitness variables, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet depending on the level of cardiorespiratory fitness in young football players.",5b8cbc51-03e9-483f-bf58-d2c0f4201521
15,methods15," Furthermore, these differences vary slightly depending on the maturational stage. The scientific literature has already shown that cardiorespiratory fitness varies greatly with development, age, maturity, and gender and is highly related to both body size and composition [36].  In recent years, it has been shown that body composition is one of the most important indicators of a player’s physical state. Therefore, fat free mass, bone mass, and body fat are the most important variables [21]. The results of the study show that the groups with lower levels of cardiorespiratory fitness presented higher values in body mass index (BMI) and body fat. The scientific literature has already shown the importance of physical activity in reducing childhood obesity [25,37]. Moreover, Ubago et al. [38] declared that playing football reduces body fat levels and body mass index (BMI) in youth development, while Mota et al.",d6134716-3f79-418f-872d-8dd19619f527
16,methods16," [39] showed an increase in lean mass and leg strength after a six-month football program. It is important to highlight that important health problems in adults have been detected along with high body mass index (BMI) and percentage of body fat values during prepubertal and pubertal ages [40]. This entails a consequent economic cost imposed on the health system [41]. Therefore, improving health and physical fitness in this population should become the main strategy to reduce the risk of future mortality, looking for a healthy body weight [42]. Thus, promoting recreational football practice during development could be a very powerful strategy to combat obesity and its immediate and future problems [43].  An improvement in respiratory values was detected once the pubertal state was reached.",08a36303-d9a0-41fc-af31-a4e1e8c53200
17,methods17," In the same direction, certain improvements were related in the rest of the parameters (forced vital capacity (FVC); PEF; forced expiratory volume (FEV)1; forced expiratory volume (FEV)1_forced vital capacity (FVC); FEF25–75) in this age group when the cardiorespiratory fitness was increased. Age, weight, height, and sex are some factors that affect lung capacity [44]. This explains the differences in favor of the pubertal group versus the prepubertal group. Specifically, the results show that football players who are in the pubertal stage have better forced vital capacity (FVC) values than players in the prepubertal stage. This is undoubtedly due to greater progress and better cardiorespiratory capacity in this population thanks to its development and its practice of exercise [45]. In contrast, prepubertal stage players who have a low cardiorespiratory fitness obtained significantly higher values for forced vital capacity (FVC).",3bcbde42-4d3b-4a7f-bacc-bd3eff314a91
18,methods18," This may occur due to the high anthropometric values of the age group (especially weight and body fat), positively affecting cardiorespiratory capacity. Therefore, it is important to determine the factors that affect respiratory functions and its control to achieve a good state of health during these stages of development [46]. Furthermore, this may also be due to the differences found in height in the prepubertal group, coinciding that the low cardiorespiratory fitness group presented higher height, which could affect forced vital capacity (FVC). The practice of sport is a key factor to increase capacity and motivation towards exercise to improve peak expiratory flow as well as quality of life and healthy habits [47].  Regarding adherence eating habits, this study revealed good adherence to the Mediterranean diet in the prepubertal and pubertal groups, as is the case in similar studies [23,33].",ea8079c0-abde-4d35-92aa-a32a4a7c3950
19,methods19," These results showed a clear tendency to maintain or increase patterns related to this type of diet since the different groups showed moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Thus, a healthy an active lifestyle based on regular exercise is associated with better nutritional habits and a higher score in the KIDMED questionnaire [48]. Finally, higher values of handgrip strength in players with lower cardiorespiratory fitness were detected in the prepubertal group, although there were no significant differences in handgrip strength in the different cardiorespiratory fitness groups. This fact could be explained that this prepubertal group showed higher anthropometric values, and therefore, a higher body mass index (BMI), or even a greater volume of body fat, may positively affect manual strength at an early age [49].",9e5a8e8b-0fb4-4a86-b4ad-50698471c32e
20,methods20,"  This study presents several limitations: (i) the anthropometry test with a portable segmental analyzer of multifrequency body composition, used in field and not laboratory research; (ii) it is important to highlight that the socioeconomic status can affect the acquisition of good healthy habits and adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Despite these limitations, the main strength of our study is that, to our knowledge, it is one of the few studies showing the influence of cardiorespiratory fitness with other variables related to health that are improved in young people who play recreational football. These data from young football players aged 8–6 years complement the evidence that suggests the importance of the maturational stage and practicing of daily physical activity or sport, such as recreational football, as well as maintaining good active and healthy lifestyle habits.  5.",3359f503-8974-43d7-9137-cbb2cb862c29
21,methods21," Conclusions This study shows that children and adolescents who play recreational football have different anthropometric and respiratory values as well as handgrip strength depending on their cardiorespiratory fitness. Furthermore, these differences are higher in the pubertal stage than in the prepubertal stage. Taken together, these results suggest that the practice of physical and sports activity is an important habit that must be acquired in the prepubertal age in order to consolidate skills in the pubertal age. Moreover, promotion of sport exercises that encourage cardiorespiratory fitness is a key factor and can be used as an effective activity to promote physical fitness and healthy habits in children and adolescents, as well as within the population that is already physically active.
