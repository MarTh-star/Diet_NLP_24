0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design  The current randomized controlled trail proposed a personalized nutritional intervention based on a Mediterranean customized diet [13], coupled with physical activity promotion, to prevent and reverse non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among obese patients with metabolic syndrome. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with number NCT04442620 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04442620; accessed on 14 February 2021). The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Balearic Islands (ref. IB 2251/14 PI; approved on 26 February 2020) and the Ethics Committee of the University of Navarra (ref. 054/2015mod2; approved on 22 February 2018), and it followed the Declaration of Helsinki ethical standards. All participants were informed of the purpose and the implications of the study and provided the written consent to participate.  2.2.",4508c7fa-1115-495c-a11c-35e3adc5a9c8
1,methods1," Subjects  Participants were male and female individuals who satisfied all eligibility criteria. Inclusion criteria included: aged 40 to 60 years, previous diagnosis of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by liver ultrasound, Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) between 27 and 40 kg/m2, and presenting at least three of the five MetS traits as described in the International Diabetes Federation (International Diabetes Federation (IDF)) consensus [14]: (1) Body Mass Index (BMI) >30 kg/m2 or increased waist circumference: ≥94 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females; (2) triglycerides (TG) levels ≥ 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), or specific treatment; (3) reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C): <40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in males and <50 mg/dL (1.",1f72f283-6806-4913-8d63-c80a04efe681
2,methods2,"29 mmol/L) in females, or specific treatment; (4) raised blood pressure (BP): systolic BP ≥130 or diastolic BP ≥ 85 mm Hg, or treatment of previously diagnosed hypertension; (5) raised fasting plasma glucose (fasting plasma glucose (FPG)) ≥100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Exclusion criteria: previous cardiovascular disease, liver disease (other than non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)), cancer or a history of malignancy in the previous 5 years, haemochromatosis, previous bariatric surgery, non-medicated depression, alcohol and drug abuse, pregnancy, primary endocrinological diseases (other than non-medicated hypothyroidism), concomitant therapy with steroids, or inability to provide informed consent.  From June 2018 to January 2020, 237 patients were screened for eligibility. Of those, 82 did not meet inclusion criteria or refused to participate. Finally, 155 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three intervention groups.",57957ff6-f245-4c23-bcc3-5865f6f6af94
3,methods3," Randomization was carried out using the MinimPy desktop minimization program, and patients were stratified by gender (male/female), T2DM (yes/no), and stage of steatosis (mild/moderate/severe). The randomization process was performed by a dedicated person and blinded to all staff and the principal investigator.  Participants were randomly allocated to one of the following three groups:  (1) The Conventional Diet (CD) group, which followed the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD)) recommendations [1] with energy restriction enough to lose 3%–5% of body weight to improve steatosis, and 7%–10% to improve most of the histopathological features of Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (Non Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH)), including fibrosis, following the general guidelines of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture (20%–35% fat, 10%–35% protein, 45%–65% carbohydrate) [15].",1be6bc99-448d-4162-b63c-ebade8a2ca0b
4,methods4,"  (2) The Mediterranean Diet–high meal frequency (MD-HMF) group, which was instructed to adhere to a Mediterranean Diet based on a distribution of macronutrients of 30%–35% fat (mainly mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids from extra virgin olive oil, nuts, and omega-3 containing foods), 25% protein (mainly from vegetable sources), and 40%–45% carbohydrates (50%–70% of the total carbohydrate intake should low on glycaemic index and rich in fiber). This diet was previously observed to reduce fat mass and overall weight and improve general oxidative stress in patients with the metabolic syndrome [16], providing high Total Antioxidant Capacity (Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC)), and focused on the chronological distribution of meals, as factors, such as meal frequency and distribution could aid in reducing the feeling of hunger, thus improving compliance to an energy restricted dietary regime [17].",931f94d8-43e1-47f6-9bf2-6a4388e92fc1
5,methods5," The total daily caloric intake of this diet was distributed over seven meals, with the highest calorie meals to be consumed early during the day.  (3) The Mediterranean Diet–physical activity (MD-PA) group, which followed an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet. Meal frequency would be of 4–5 meals a day including snacks. This group consumed 35%–40% of total calories from fat (8–10% of Saturated Fatty Acids, >20% of Monounsaturated Fatty Acids, >10% of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and <300 mg/day of Cholesterol), approximately 20% of total calories from proteins and 40–45% or more of total calories from carbohydrates (low glycaemic index). Sodium chloride should not exceed 6 g a day (2.4 g of sodium), and dietary fiber should be no less than 30–35 g/day [18].  Trained dietitians provided patients in the three arms with a prescription of total calories to consume daily, dietary plans based on exchange systems, and a 7-day menu for each season.",da0c05ae-aafa-454a-b15a-bfdd06781318
6,methods6," Patients were advised to monitor their weight weekly, and, to facilitate adherence, patient-dietitian contact (in person, by telephone, or e-mail) was provided once every two weeks during the first 6 months and once a month thereafter.  In terms of physical activity, the CD and MD-HMF groups were instructed to accumulate a minimum of 10,000 steps a day (recorded by a personal pedometer) [19], while the MD-PA group was instructed to undergo 35 min interval training session three times a week, in the combination of two instructor-led on-site training and one remote prescribed training session a week for the whole duration of the trial. The 35-min on-site training sessions were divided in three different phases: a 5-min warm-up, 20-min interval training, and 10-min breathing and stretching. The interval training included five activities of moderate intensity with adequate recovery between sets.",d3e33e0a-9077-4ee3-8cbe-ab0907003a01
7,methods7," The “remote” training sessions, on the other hand, were pre-recorded video sessions that patients would receive via instant messages or e-mails. The weekly moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity proposed was equivalent to 10,000 daily steps in terms of caloric expenditure (400 kcal for a person that weights 70 kg); nevertheless, the intensity of each exercise was adjusted to the physical condition of each subject. Fitness specialists were responsible for the content of both the on-site and remote training sessions and provided training and support to volunteering research team members giving interval training sessions to patients.  Each intervention aimed at reducing caloric intake by 25%–30% of baseline intake and increase energy expenditure by 400 kcal/70 kg (5.7 kcal per kg of body weight).  2.3. Measurements  Information on sociodemographic, medical history, smoking status, and alcohol consumption was collected by a dietitian and study nurse at baseline.",440fb018-96ed-4d82-abaa-5a8d73bc4e74
8,methods8," Height was also measured at baseline using a mobile stadiometer (Seca 213, SECA Deutschland, Hamburg, Germany), with the participant’s head maintained in the Frankfort plane, and to the nearest millimeter.  At baseline and at 6-month follow-up, weight, body fat, Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), blood pressure (BP), and information on energy expenditure were taken by trained dietitians. Weight and body fat were measured using a Segmental Body Composition Analyzer for impedance testing (Tanita MC780P-MA, Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), with participants wearing light clothes and no shoes (0.6 kg of weight was subtracted for their clothing). Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated using the standard formula (weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). WC was measured in duplicate with an anthropometric tape, halfway between the last rib and the iliac crest, with participants standing upright.",7e76b962-9102-4d04-92ae-7f6aa37834ee
9,methods9," BP was measured in triplicate (2 min apart) with a validated semi-automatic oscillometer (Omron HEM-705CP, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands), in the non-dominant arm after a 5-min rest in a seated position. The average of the three measurements was recorded and used for statistical analysis. Information on mean weekly time (in minutes) of physical activity was collected using the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (Spanish version): energy expenditure was expressed as metabolic equivalents of task (MET)·min/week [20,21].  2.4. Dietary Intakes  Mean dietary intakes at baseline and 6-months were assessed by a trained dietitian using a validated 148 items-Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) [22]. The 148 items consist of usual portion sizes of foods and beverages with response categories to indicate frequency of consumption over a period of 12 months.",9e4586f5-604b-460b-8b49-49a0dae33ffa
10,methods10," Energy and nutrients intakes were calculated by multiplying the nutrient composition of the portion size of each item by the frequency of consumption using a computer program based on available food composition tables [23]. Dietary information derived from the 148-items Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) included total energy expressed as kcal per day (kcal/d), macro- and micro-nutrient intakes, and intakes according to food groups.  Adherence to the MedDiet was assessed by means of a 17-items MedDiet adherence questionnaire, previously used in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED)) trial [24]. Each item of the questionnaire related to a specific dietary objective contemplated by the MedDiet and could be scored as 1 (compliance) or 0 (non-compliance).",e102ff7e-7a7e-4836-92c8-e5a36d9db589
11,methods11," The total score ranged between 0 and 17, such as a score of 0 indicated no compliance, and a score of 17 indicated maximum adherence.  2.5. Blood Collection and Analysis  At each visit, venous blood and single spot urine samples were collected in the morning after a 12-h overnight fast. Blood was collected through a venous catheter from the antecubital vein in suitable vacutainers. Measures included routine laboratory parameters, such as fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (aminotransferase (AST)), alanine aminotransferase (aminotransferase (ALT)), gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT)), uric acid, urea, creatinine, albumin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated according to the Friedewald Formula [25].",c94be614-c2f4-4811-9304-8340a288a68a
12,methods12," Additional measures included serum fasting insulin, C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)), serum ferritin, and thyroid stimulating hormone (thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)). Urinary albumin excretion was measured as urinary albumin-to-creatine ratio (urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR)). The urinary albumin concentration was determined by immunoturbidimetric assay and urinary creatinine concentration was measured by a modified Jaffe method on an Abbott ARCHITECT c16000 (Abbott, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA). Insulin resistance index was calculated using the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) formula by Matthews et al. [26], as well as the TGs and glucose (TyG) index, calculated as the natural logarithm of the product of fasting plasma glucose and TG [27].",4d64874f-0cb4-4aad-a066-349700e1ab1b
13,methods13,"  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (eglomerular filtration rate (GFR)) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (chronic kidney disease (CKD)-EPI) formula developed in 2009 [28]. The equation normalizes estimated renal function for body surface area (body surface area (BSA)) and expresses as eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) mL/min/1.73 m2. Although the equation has been validated in populations with normal, as well as low, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and is generally well-accepted [29], it has been argued that indexing eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) for body surface area (BSA) in patients with increased weight can result in an underestimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as well as masking a genuine association between renal function and body fat, such that it has been suggested that absolute estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be used instead [30,31,32].",ef9cd49b-58db-4796-9a0f-a64382f588d6
14,methods14," Accordingly, eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) was converted to absolute values (mL/min) by using the following formula [30]: (eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) mL/min/1.73 m2 *body surface area (BSA))/1.73 m2. body surface area (BSA) was calculated using the DuBois and DuBois equation [33]. Glomerular hyperfiltration was defined as eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 120 mL/min [34].  2.6. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI))  Randomized patients presented a diagnosis of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by ultrasound at baseline, nevertheless presence of liver fat was verified by abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (Signa Explorer 1.5T, General Electric Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA, or Siemens Aera 1.5T, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany; depending on the recruiting center) and quantified as mean percentage (%). A mean intrahepatic fat ≥6.4% was considered clinically relevant [35].  2.7.",7301eff1-7ae4-4add-abd5-457c33e9d207
15,methods15," Study Outcomes  The primary outcome was to assess changes in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) and eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) after a 6-months intervention for the whole sample and differences in change between the three intervention arms and within each arm. Changes in mean hepatic fat accumulation (quantified by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)), as well as in anthropometric, clinical, laboratory, and dietary parameters, were also assessed. Lastly, possible relationships between these changes and changes in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) and eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) were also explored.  2.8. Statistics  Sample size was estimated for weight loss as the primary outcome of the study, assuming a two-group t-test (two-sided) of the difference between the control group and the two intervention groups (group ratio = 2). Based on previous evidence [16,36], a weight reduction difference of 2.5 kg with a standard deviation (SD) of 4.",219ba941-ee0e-4dbc-857c-87479d6f871c
16,methods16,"5 was expected between the control group and the intervention groups. A total sample size of 150 patients was needed to give the trial a 95% power to detect a statistically significant difference in weight loss between the control and the intervention groups (α = 0.05), as well as to account for a 20% drop-out rate. The analysis was conducted by modified intention to treat (mITT) with randomized participants analyzed according to the treatment group originally assigned but including only those with available urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) and eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) data at both baseline and 6-months follow-up. Variable distribution was assessed by Shapiro-Wilk test and visual inspection of histograms and normal probability plots.",da3d6c80-57b2-4272-9761-0a1546ef7cee
17,methods17," Highly skewed variables, such as baseline and 6-months urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR), HOMA-IR, serum ferritin, fasting glucose, and triglycerides, were log-transformed before analysis; however, in the tables, they are presented as untransformed data for ease of interpretation. Continuous variables were expressed as means ± SD. Categorical data were expressed as count (%). One-way analysis of variance (as count (%) One way analysis of variance (ANOVA)), or unequal variance t-test in case of heterogeneity for continuous variables were used to compare unadjusted means of baseline clinical characteristics between the three intervention groups to assess whether, by removing patients without available urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) and/or eglomerular filtration rate (GFR), the balance in baseline characteristics had been affected. Within-group comparisons before and after intervention, for the whole sample, were assessed by paired sample t-test.",60a817a3-13b2-4866-b70d-24418284af1b
18,methods18," Within-group comparisons for each intervention were assessed by paired sample t-test and repeated measures as count (%) One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and by McNemar test for frequencies. Between-group changes were assessed by one-way ANCOVA, while statistically controlling for baseline measures. Post-hoc analyses were performed by applying the Bonferroni method.  Bivariate correlations of changes (delta) in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) and eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) with changes (delta) in anthropometric, clinical, laboratory, and dietary parameters were evaluated by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Variables with a level of significance (p) below 0.05 (two-tailed) were entered in multiple linear regression models to investigate the association between changes in independent covariates and changes in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR)/eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) as outcome variables.",625d6aef-a54c-41b1-856c-234cee2f2eef
19,methods19," The model was then adjusted for the delta of energy intake (kcal), Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m2), systolic BP (mmHg), TyG, METs (min/week), and intervention group. All p values were two-sided, with p < 0.05.  Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software package, version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  3. Results  Of the 155 patients included, 4 patients withdrew their consent before receiving intervention, and 8 withdrew their consent or were lost-to-follow-up before completing the first 6 months of the trial. Moreover, 14 patients did not present available data on urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR)/eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) at baseline and/or 6-months and were excluded from the analysis. One patient who showed evidence of proteinuria and reduced renal function (urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) = 3871.6 mg/g; eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) = 23.3 mL/min/1.73 m2) was also excluded from the analysis to avoid biased results.",5e593eb9-e924-42e5-a1e2-15cd6e245f46
20,methods20," Finally, data from a total of 128 participants were analyzed. Patients were distributed as follows: 42 in the CD group; 44 in the DM-HMF group; and 43 in the DM-PA group.  3.1. Patients’ Characteristics  As shown in Table 1, of the 128 patients, 50 (39.1%) were females, 24 (18.7%) were current smokers, 25 (19.5%) were consuming more than 7 alcoholic beverages a week, and most patients (53, 41.4%) did not practice physical activity. Mean age ± SD was 52.9 ± 7.4 years. At baseline, 29 participants (22.7%) were diabetics, and 53 (41.4%) showed hypertension.  3.2. Effect of Intervention on Anthropometrics, Energy Expenditure, Adherence to Mediterranean Diet, urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR), and eglomerular filtration rate (GFR)  Table 2 shows changes in anthropometrical, lifestyle, renal, and hepatic variables within and between intervention groups at 6 months versus baseline. At baseline, weight averaged 95.5 ± 14.7 kg, Body Mass Index (BMI) averaged 33.6 ± 3.",0f0ac011-633e-4232-b43b-51cbb4bf94cc
21,methods21,"6 kg/m2, waist circumference was 111.8 ± 9.0 cm, and fat mass % was 35.7 ± 7.0. After intervention, body weight decreased by 6.1 ± 5.6 kg in the whole sample (p < 0.001), 5.7 ± 5.5 kg in the CD group (p < 0.001), 7.8 ± 6.0 kg in the MD-HMF group (p < 0.001), and 4.8 ± 5.0 kg in the MD-PA group (p < 0.001). These changes were different between the MD-HMF and MD-PA groups (p = 0.048). Time per group interaction for weight was also significant (p = 0.040). Consistent with the change in weight, Body Mass Index (BMI) was also reduced for the whole sample, as well as for each group. Differences in Body Mass Index (BMI) change between groups were not significant; nevertheless, the interaction between time and group was significant (p = 0.030). Waist circumference was reduced in the whole sample, as well as in the MD-HMF and the MD-PA groups, but not in the CD group.",4c72bf11-e1d0-4068-a171-50532903b0b1
22,methods22," Fat mass %, on the other hand, did not change appreciably for the whole sample or for the MD-HMF group, but it reduced significantly in the CD and MD-PA groups. Time group interaction for waist circumference and fat mass % were not significant, as well as in waist circumference and percentage of fat mass change between groups.  At baseline, adherence to the MedDiet scored an average of 7 ± 3. After intervention, adherence to the MedDiet increased significantly for the whole sample, as well as for each intervention group. Between-group changes were significant between the CD and the MD-HMF groups and the MD-HMF and MD-PA groups (p < 0.001). Time per group interaction was also significant (p < 0.001). Physical activity increased significantly for the whole sample; however, they did not reach significance for any of the intervention groups. Changes between groups were also not significant.  At baseline, urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) for the whole sample was 15.3 ± 31.",db6bcc2f-36a1-4e43-adb9-8ff7cc330086
23,methods24," The interaction between time and groups showed significance, as the largest reduction in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) at 6 months was observed in those two groups (CD and MD-PA) with higher urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) levels at baseline. There were no differences in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) changes between the three groups at 6 months after adjusting for baseline values.  When the subjects were stratified according to baseline stages of urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) (normal urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) < 30 mg/g, and moderately increased urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) = 30–300 mg/g), patients with moderately increased albuminuria experienced a significant reduction in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR), whilst those with normal baseline urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) values experienced no change (Figure 1A and Table 2).",cb6ea1f2-e422-4604-be85-9f1e2fbe7472
24,methods25," The difference between patients with urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) < 30 mg/g and urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) 30–300 mg/g group controlled for baseline values was significant (p < 0.001), as well as the effect of interaction between stages of urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) and time on changes in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) (data not shown). After performing a McNemar-Bower symmetry test, 14 (82%) of the 17 patients with baseline values of urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) between 30 and 300 mg/g reverted to a stage or normal albuminuria (p = 0.031) (Figure 2A). Out of the three intervention groups, the MD-PA and CD groups experienced the most significant reduction. In the MD-PA group, all of the 9 patients with increased albumin levels at baseline regressed to a normal state after 6 months (p < 0.001); in the CD group, 4 of 6 patients regressed to normal urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR).",a5c1ccce-fdff-44f5-8dbd-10aa07faea9b
25,methods26," As for the MD-HMF group, only two patients (1.6% of the entire sample) presented increased albuminuria at baseline, and 1 regressed to a normal state of albuminuria.  Mean eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) remained practically unchanged after 6 months intervention for the whole sample, as well as for the three intervention groups; between-group differences were also non-significant. Nevertheless, when dividing the sample according to eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) values (normal filtration and hyperfiltration), those who showed hyperfiltration experienced a greater eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction compared to those who showed normal filtration (Figure 1B) and (Table 2). When controlling for baseline values, the difference between the two groups (normal and hyperfiltration) was significant (p < 0.001). The interaction between eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) groups and time was also significant (p = 0.002). When performing a McNemar-Bower symmetry test, 18 patients (42.",1e670107-eead-4407-ac4f-4f3da6ece9ec
26,methods27,"9%) reverted to normal filtration from a state of hyperfiltration (p = 0.004) (Figure 2B). Out of the three intervention groups, the MD-PA experienced the most reduction (12.1 ± 18.8 mL/min; p = 0.017), with 8 out of 17 patients with hyperfiltration at baseline regressing to normal filtration after 6 months.  At baseline, mean liver fat % was 13.4 ± 11.2, with 22 participants (17.2%) presenting severe steatosis, while liver stiffness was 5.4 ± 2.1 kPa, with 28 patients (21.9%) presenting fibrosis; no patients presented Non Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH). Mean liver enzymes were 37.5 ± 31.1 U/L for aminotransferase (ALT), 26.2 ± 13.4 U/L for aminotransferase (AST), and 19.2 ± 54.5 U/L for gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT). Following intervention, liver fat decreased for the whole sample and for the three groups. Differences in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) changes were significant between the CD and MD-HMF groups (p = 0.030). Time per group interaction was not significant.",cb77bcdd-f48b-4928-8ff8-d70efdefcb37
27,methods28," Interestingly, although mean liver stiffness did not change for the whole group, nor for any of the intervention groups. Fifteen of the 28 patients that presented fibrosis at baseline reverted to a normal stage after intervention; however, this change was not significant. aminotransferase (ALT), aminotransferase (AST) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) were significantly reduced in the whole group. aminotransferase (ALT) levels were reduced significantly in the three intervention groups, aminotransferase (AST) was reduced in the CD group only, and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) was reduced in the CD and the MD-PA groups. No differences in changes in transaminase levels were observed between groups; time per group interaction was also not significant.  3.3. Effect of Intervention on Clinical and Biochemical Parameters  As shown in Table 3, after 6 months intervention, systolic BP (−5.6 ± 15.7 mmHg; p < 0.001) and diastolic BP (−3.9 ± 8.7 mmHg; p < 0.001), heart rate (−5.1 ± 8.",6ac968fc-cce3-4504-ad90-9d4d5f5b905e

Changes between groups were not significant for any of the considered parameters. Time per group interactions for systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were not significant.  At baseline, fasting glucose for the whole sample was 116.2 ± 42.4 mg/dL, HbA1c was 6.1 ± 1.2%, and the average HOMA-IR was 5.9 ± 9.8. Fasting glucose was significantly decreased for the whole sample, as well as for the CD group, but did not change for the MD-HMF and the MD-PA groups. Fasting insulin was significantly reduced for the whole sample and for each of the interventions. HbA1c was significantly reduced for the whole sample and for the MD-HMF and MD-PA groups only. HOMA-IR was significantly decreased for the whole sample, as well as for each intervention.",5d001c7e-c949-4f51-b76a-4feee51791c8

Total cholesterol levels decreased significantly for the whole sample and for the MD-HMF group. HDL-cholesterol levels increased for the whole sample, as well as for the intervention groups. LDL-cholesterol levels, on the other hand, did not change. TG levels were reduced for the whole sample, as well as for the intervention groups. There were no differences in changes in blood lipid parameters between groups; time and group interactions were not significant.  Serum ferritin was reduced in the whole sample and in the CD and MD-HMF groups but not in the MD-PA group. No differences in changes in serum ferritin were observed between groups, and the interaction between time and group was also not significant.  3.4.",d5e1c2be-66b2-4805-84cc-364717984ba8
30,methods31," Effect of Intervention on Energy and Nutrient Intake  Energy intake significantly decreased for the whole group and within each intervention group (Table 4). However, between group analysis and time per group interaction did not show significance. In terms of macronutrient intake, the sample reduced carbohydrate and lipid intakes, while protein intake remained unchanged. The reduction in lipid intake was explained by a reduction in mono-unsaturated fatty acids (mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) (p = 0.010), saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)) (p < 0.001), trans fatty acids (trans fatty acids (TFA)) (p < 0.001), cholesterol (p < 0.001), and by a reduction in animal fat consumption (p < 0.001). Omega-3, on the other hand, was increased (p = 0.004). Differences in macronutrient intakes between the three groups were observed for carbohydrates only and were significantly reduced in the MD-HMF group compared to the CD group (p = 0.049).",83070426-ef33-446a-ad13-3ece7a67dcff
31,methods32," The combined effect for time and groups was not significant on any of the macronutrients considered.  As shown in Table 5, mineral and vitamin intakes were improved for the whole sample, and magnesium and potassium intakes increased, while that of sodium decreased. Vitamin B6 and folic acid intake were also increased. Differences in mineral and vitamin intakes between the three intervention groups were observed for sodium, which was significantly reduced in the MD-HMF group as compared to the others (p = 0.020): vitamin B6, which was significantly increased in the MD-HMF groups compared to the MD-PA group (p = 0.049); and vitamin D, which was significantly increased in the MD-PA group as compares to the MD-HMF group (p = 0.020). A combined effect for time and group was observed for potassium (p = 0.009), vitamin B2 (p = 0.047), vitamin B6 (p = 0.009), folic acid (p = 0.020), and vitamin C (p = 0.030).",2b3bab9e-2b19-43e1-8e47-1460e5900e4a
32,methods33,"  Changes in macro- and micronutrient intakes were explained by an increased consumption of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and fish, and by a general increase in foods from vegetable sources, with a concomitant reduced consumption of cereals, meat and meat products, and sugary foods, such as sweets and pastries, as shown in Table 6. Differences between groups were observed in fruit consumption only, where the MD-HMF group significantly increased fruit consumption compared to the CD group (p = 0.030). Time per group interaction was significant for consumption of fruit (p = 0.005) and foods from vegetables sources (p = 0.010).  3.5.

Discussion  In the current randomized trial of patients with metabolic syndrome and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), 6-month weight loss intervention significantly ameliorated glomerular hyperfiltration and moderately increased albuminuria. Reduction of eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) was associated with a reduction in liver fat % and TyG-index, as well as with an increase in physical activity. There were no differences between groups in neither urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) nor eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction. However, since the CD and the MD-PA groups showed higher levels of urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) at baseline, patients in these groups also experienced a higher decrease in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) values.  eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased by 7.35 ± 13.10% in patients presenting hyperfiltration at baseline.",d8d8f2c2-81e8-4c9e-914d-5b56257a64b1
36,methods37," Similar results were found in a previous pilot intervention study on 70 hyperfiltration patients with diabetes and abdominal obesity, in which glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured by iohexol plasma clearance [10]. In the intervention group with caloric restriction, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was reduced by 7.6 ± 11.7%, while, in the control group, it was reduced by 2.7 ± 11.1%, over a 6-month follow-up. Amelioration of hyperfiltration was associated with a reduction in blood pressure and body weight, and, most importantly, the short-term glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction achieved by caloric restriction predicted a long-term glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline of 0.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 per month compared to the that of the control group, which predicted a faster long-term decline of 0.36 mL/min/1.73 m2 per month.",a25766ba-0cdb-46c1-ad7c-5bf49c4bd603
37,methods38," Previous authors concluded that the amelioration of hyperfiltration was reno-protective as the predicted rate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline was similar to that observed in aging healthy adults [37]. Similarly, in a longitudinal study [8] including a cohort of 600 hypertensive T2DM patients with normal levels of albuminuria at baseline, a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction by 10% or more within a period of 6 months with angiotensin converting enzyme (angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE))-inhibitors was associated with a significantly slower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline over 4 years. Amelioration of hyperfiltration has been associated significantly with improved blood pressure and glucose control.",850811e7-0258-4dda-b571-c7e925894ad7
38,methods39," In the current study, only one-third (31%) of patients with hyperfiltration were diabetics; nevertheless, hyperfiltration is associated with a worse cardiometabolic profile compared to normal filtration subjects [38], and it has been proposed as an early marker of renal damage in metabolically unhealthy obesity [38,39]. Moreover, hyperfiltration has been recently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality [40]. Thus, amelioration of hyperfiltration by weight loss might be beneficial for patients with obesity and MetS as they may achieve a persistent reno-protective effect over the long term and possibly reduce cardiovascular risk. Importantly, treatment strategies for hyperfiltration including blood glucose lowering medications, use of Angiotensin-Converted-Enzyme – Angiotensin-Receptor-Blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-ARBs) therapy, controlled protein intakes and weight loss have been suggested for patients with diabetes [41].",97e6196d-29be-416d-859d-16126e34b6fd
39,methods40," In patients who are not yet in need of medications, but that might benefit from hyperfiltration reduction, weight loss through diet and exercise ameliorates several associated risk factors, even at subclinical levels, and might achieve a significant short-term eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction with long-term renal protection.  The reduction of eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) was significantly associated with a reduction in liver fat % and TyG-index, and with an increase in physical activity. Although this finding is consistent with the fact that non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) share multiple cardiometabolic risk factors including insulin resistance and obesity [4], evidence of a direct association between hepatic steatosis and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is only available in patients with an already compromised renal function (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2).",7258af7b-22ab-449a-beba-31a9ffb85719
40,methods41," non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been recognized as a risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [3]; between 20 and 50% of patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have chronic kidney disease (CKD), compared with 5–30% of patients without non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [42]. Moreover, once chronic kidney disease (CKD) is present, its severity is associated with progression of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to fibrosis and Non Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH) [3]. On the other hand, the association between hyperfiltration and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to this date has only been described in obese children. The study observed that in a cohort of 179 obese children aged 12–16 years with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) confirmed by histological examination, 20% showed hyperfiltration (>136 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 15% had low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (<90 mL/min/1.73 m2).",6ded0fad-1649-4b0e-9438-29e99cbaa717
41,methods42," Compared with normal eglomerular filtration rate (GFR), hyperfiltration was associated with greater non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score, independent of age, sex, ethnicity, obesity severity, T2DM, and medications [11]. In the current study, the finding that amelioration of glomerular hyperfiltration was driven by a reduction of intrahepatic fat could be explained by the fact that, in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) synthesis, very low density lipoproteins (very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)) are increased, and, in turn, increased amounts of triglycerides are delivered to non-adipose peripheral tissues and organs, such as the kidney [43]. Intracellular lipid accumulation can generate a toxic environment in which lipid metabolites reduce mitochondrial function and increase oxidation and inflammation [44,45], which, at the kidney level, can possibly contribute to a state of glomerular hyperfiltration [44].",fea36569-fcbb-4edd-8f93-adf583baf98a
42,methods43," Of note, ectopic fat accumulation strongly correlates with insulin resistance, which was also reduced in our sample and significantly predicted reduction of hyperfiltration. This finding is consistent with previous observations that insulin resistance plays an important role in the development of glomerular hyperfiltration [38,46] and that increased glucose disposal rate (glucose disposal rate (GDR)), achieved either through caloric restriction [10], bariatric surgery [9], or medical therapy [8] is associated with amelioration of hyperfiltration. Interestingly, in the previously mentioned longitudinal study [8], a major finding was that 23% of patients which were hyperfiltrating at baseline did not improve after the first 6 months of intervention with Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)) blockers and showed a much rapid glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline (4.2 mL/min/1.",f94c2d32-c2bb-461d-a6e3-9e399973f638
43,methods44,"73 m2 per year) during the 4 years of follow-up compared to those who ameliorated hyperfiltration (1.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year). Persistent hyperfiltration was strongly associated with severely lower glucose disposal rate (GDR) as assessed by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, suggesting a powerful causative relationship.  A significant increase in physical activity, indicating increased energy expenditure, was also associated with a decrease in eglomerular filtration rate (GFR). Physical activity and increased energy expenditure have long been associated with amelioration of obesity and associated cardiometabolic risk factors [47], of insulin resistance [48], and, more recently, of hyperfiltration in the general population [49]. Physical activity reduces central obesity, inflammation, and oxidative stress and, together with diet, is the first line of therapy for the prevention and amelioration of most obesity associated conditions [48].",711d0941-b123-4b64-93a8-3d634d0b3a48
44,methods45,"  Amelioration of glomerular hyperfiltration was independent of protein intake. High protein intakes have been observed to induce glomerular hyperfiltration [50]; nevertheless, in our study, mean protein consumption remained virtually unchanged during the intervention. Sodium intake, on the other hand, was significantly reduced after intervention; however, it was not associated with changes in eglomerular filtration rate (GFR).  Studies on the possible amelioration of renal hyperfiltration through an intervention aimed at reducing liver fat accumulation in patients without particular liver complications are lacking. However, when lifestyle modifications were applied to patients with Non Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH), improvement of liver histology was associated with an increase in eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) [51]. In an interesting review by Glass et al.",7956a1d8-4679-477e-8a93-c7b33acbf58e
45,methods46," [52], it is speculated that, since non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with risk factors that characterize other metabolically linked diseases, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), amongst others, amelioration of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) could improve renal function. To this date, the only available treatment for amelioration of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is through lifestyle modifications. Weight gain has been associated with the development of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as well as weight loss, through diet and exercise, with its remission [53].  Lifestyle intervention in this study also reduced mean urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) in patients with increased albuminuria.",105fa08f-5d19-40c1-9112-365eb3e2ae3a
46,methods47," Such a finding is clinically relevant as increased albuminuria is an established risk factor for nephropathy and cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD)) [54], and an emerging risk marker for all-cause mortality, cardiac abnormalities, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease in the general population [54,55], whereas reduction in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) has been associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality independently of blood pressure control [53]. Ibsen et al. [56] observed that, in hypertensive adults receiving either losartan or atenolol during a mean follow-up of 4.8 years, lowering of urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) resulted in a stepwise decrease in cardiovascular event rate (cardiovascular death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, and fatal and non-fatal stroke).",656f1cd9-1f5b-4bbf-b3ef-0f4d8d3c7706
47,methods48," Interestingly, the reduction in event rate associated with a reduction in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) occurred for patients with increased albuminuria, as well as in those with normal albuminuria at baseline. In the current study, a significant reduction in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) was only observed in those with increased urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) at baseline, whereas those with normal baseline levels did not experience an appreciable change. Nevertheless, 82% of patients with baseline values of urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) between 30 and 300 mg/g reverted to a stage or normal albuminuria. The reduction of albuminuria was not associated with changes in liver fat, as initially expected. Previous cross-sectional and cohort studies showed an association between non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and increased albuminuria [57], which is speculated to be driven by insulin resistance [58].",0a3f59ee-8e55-4415-902e-414aff54fc31
48,methods49," The fact that current results differ from previous evidence, as discussed later, could be due to the small number of patients, as well as to the study design.  Interestingly, reduction of urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) was associated with higher albuminuria levels at baseline; the same was observed for eglomerular filtration rate (GFR), in which reduction was associated with a baseline hyperfiltrating stage, meaning that, in these patients, at increased risk of accelerated renal function loss, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the benefit of weight loss and increased physical activity was more clinically significant. Changes in urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were concomitant to a generally improved cardiometabolic state.",2b583c71-ce6d-4e43-ac18-96dbfc414fee
49,methods50," By increasing energy expenditure, reducing caloric intake, and improving diet quality, adult patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and MetS achieved weight loss and reduced waist circumference, improved liver profile, blood pressure, glucose control, and blood lipid profile, and reduced insulin resistance. Taken together, these findings suggest that improving lifestyle habits can produce important cardiometabolic changes which could counteract the classical scenario of the evolution of renal function loss and obese nephropathy.  Strengths and Limitations  The main strength of this study is that liver images were obtained by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which is considered the most sensitive and accurate non-invasive method for quantifying liver fat [59,60,61]. Moreover, as shown by the reduction in weight and waist circumference and by the increase in energy expenditure, patients included in the study were highly compliant with the interventions.",f1eb1c56-95a3-464a-90e7-622683cce9bd
50,methods51," Contrary to what is usually argued, adherence to dietary and physical activity advice can be achieved, if done in a personalized manner and with motivating strategies. On the other hand, the major limitation was the secondary analysis design of the study. Patients were not included according to stages of urinary albumin to creatine ratio (UACR) or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as inclusion criteria aimed specifically at studying patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and MetS, independently of possible renal involvement. Moreover, a bigger sample could give a more confident answer to the possible relationship between non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and albuminuria/glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a population with MetS.  5.",32dac5a8-01ca-4d6b-9886-8734963f1b8a
51,methods52," Conclusions  In patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and MetS, lifestyle intervention significantly improved several major risk factors associated with accelerated renal function loss and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Caloric restriction coupled with increased energy expenditure reduced hepatic fat accumulation and insulin resistance, which in turn significantly reduced glomerular hyperfiltration over a period of 6 months. Increased albuminuria was also significantly reduced; however, such change was not found to be associated with reduced liver fat.  Patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are at increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hyperfiltration is the first stage of impaired function loss.",8f9ce6fd-3ea5-4389-aaba-b8de19351e2e
52,methods53," Amelioration of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hyperfiltration with lifestyle modification is a valid and inexpensive strategy for prevention of renal function loss and other associated conditions in patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Further evidence from long-term randomized clinical trials is needed to confirm the association between non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hyperfiltration and assess whether lifestyle intervention strategies can provide long-term renal, metabolic, and cardiovascular protection.
