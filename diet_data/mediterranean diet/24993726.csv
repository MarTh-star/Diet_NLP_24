0,introduction0,"Mediterranean diet is the golden standard for healthy nutrition and is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events.1 Traditionally, Mediterranean diet is characterized by high intake of fruits, vegetables, cereals, fish and moderate wine consumption, with scarce intake of dairy products and red meat. Most important, the health benefits of Mediterranean diet have been attributed to the high intake of monounsaturated fat, mostly represented by extra virgin olive oil (Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)). Thus, recent results from the PREDIMED study showed that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) added to the Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of cardiovascular events compared with controls.1 Among the mechanism(s) potentially attributable to the antiatherosclerotic effect, the prevention of new-onset diabetes might have a role, but the biologic plausibility of such positive association is still unclear.",37df899d-41eb-41b3-b2a5-ae94a7eee66c
1,introduction1," Prevention of diabetes might be attributable to the antioxidant property of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO);2 thus, oxidative stress seems to be implicated in β-cells dysfunction and eventually diabetes.3 Furthermore, oxidative stress is responsible for activation of dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4),4 which cleaves incretins downregulating insulin secretion.5 We have recently demonstrated that a Mediterranean-type meal supplemented with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is associated with reduced post-prandial oxidative stress generated by NOX2, the catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase.6 On the basis of this finding, we speculated that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), added to Mediterranean-type meal, could improve post-prandial glycaemic control via an oxidative stress-mediated mechanism.",61451c6e-7fd7-43fe-8ef3-ba53db1fab1f

Analysis of incretins' secretion showed significant differences between the meal with and without Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Thus, incretins increased more significantly in subjects supplemented with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) compared with those who did not receive it (Figures 1c and d; Table 1); furthermore, DPP-4 protein and activity showed a lower increase after meal with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (Figures 1e and f; Table 1).",77ff328f-bcd7-4f0f-a011-135f737fbc33

15,discussion0,"This is the first study demonstrating that a Mediterranean-type meal supplemented with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has a beneficial effect on post-prandial glycemic and lipid profile by decreasing blood glucose, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C and ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL).  There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that post-prandial changes of glycemic and lipid profile might have deleterious effect on vascular disease by promoting and/or aggravating the atherosclerotic process.7, 8 Moreover, post-prandial glucose has been associated with an higher incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with9 and without diabetes.10 Thus, blunting or minimizing post-prandial glycemic and lipid profile could have a positive impact in the progression of atherosclerosis.",2abd555d-4cb9-44ba-b7a1-0f5fa2750a64
16,discussion1,"11 Observational and interventional studies consistently demonstrated a potentially beneficial effect of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on the atherosclerotic process,1, 12, 13 but the underlying mechanism is still undefined. Data regarding the impact of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on post-prandial glycemic and lipid profile are still lacking. The novelty of the present study is in the demonstration that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) improves the post-prandial glycemic control by lowering and increasing blood glucose and insulin, respectively. Post-prandial glycemic control is regulated by incretins, which upregulate insulin secretion and in turn lowers blood glucose. Incretins such as GLP1 and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are secreted by distal small intestine in response to its stimulation, bind receptors in the endocrine pancreas so eliciting insulin secretion and lowering post-prandial blood glucose and are rapidly inactivated by DPP-4.",92d43b2e-1d47-4042-92e3-cdc89786eda2
17,discussion2,"14, 15 Our approach was to evaluate whether Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) may stimulate intestinal cells and trigger endogenous incretin release. Analysis of GLP-1 and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) after Mediterranean-type lunch demonstrated that supplementation with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was associated with an increase of both incretins coincidentally with a decrease of DPP-4 activity suggesting that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) behaves as a DPP-4 inhibitor. The antioxidant effect of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)6 may account for the improved post-prandial glycaemia as oxidative stress is implicated in incretin secretion and metabolism. Oxidative stress affects, in fact, insulin signaling cascade, leading to insulin resistance3 and cumulative hyperglycemia and resultant AGE-induced ROS generation16 might impair the incretins' effects via elevation of circulating DPP-4 concentration.",fc58c739-f73a-4478-b54a-861e2785cf75
18,discussion3,"4 Of note, we found that, compared with control, post-prandial ox-low density lipoprotein (LDL) increase was almost blunted by Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and paralleled DPP-4 activity changes with a direct correlation between these two variables, reinforcing the concept that oxidative stress upregulates DPP-4 activity4 and eventually inhibits insulin secretion. Among the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) components, oleuropein would be likely to downregulate NOX-2-derived oxidative stress,6 but further study is necessary to investigate if the polyphenol component of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) also have a role.  An unexpected finding of the study was the improvement of lipid profile observed after Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) administration. Thus, post-prandial serum low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C was significantly reduced compared with control suggesting a lipid-lowering effect of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).",a7887640-88f0-43f3-bf59-5138714b6e0d
19,discussion4," This effect seems to be specific for low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, as neither triglycerides nor high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C were modified compared with control. The positive impact of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on post-prandial low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C is more difficult to interpret. We have not data that may help to explain if such beneficial effect depends on a specific Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) interference with cholesterol absorption in the gastrointestinal tract or on a direct activity of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on cholesterol biosynthesis. This issue deserves further investigation.  To investigate if these changes on serum glucose and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C were peculiar for Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), we compared Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) versus corn oil with regard to the changes of post-prandial glycemic and lipid profile.",61eda900-f88a-4b65-a156-fc167cdf4403
20,discussion5," Also this experiment confirmed the beneficial effect of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) as it significantly improved both glycemic and lipid profile compared with corn oil so suggesting that its components may favorably influence glucose and cholesterol metabolism.  The study has limitation and implication. We have not data specifically addressing insulin secretion because early serum glucose and insulin increment after lunch are not available.17 The exact mechanism through which Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) downregulates DPP-4 has not been addressed in the present study and should be investigated. It is possible that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) downregulates NOX2-derived oxidative stress,6 but it cannot be excluded that post-prandial low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C lowering may also have a role.18 We cannot exclude that corn oil may have positive effect when compared with control as this issue was not investigated in the present study.",6ce228dc-2abf-4bf8-be5e-578e2e703827
21,discussion6," The study has been performed in healthy subjects and, therefore, further study is necessary to see whether Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has such beneficial effect in patients with diabetes or dyslipidemia. Finally it remains to establish whether the changes observed with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) persist chronically.  While our findings provide a potential explanation for the inverse association between Mediterranean diet and diabetes risk, as GLP-1 may reduce cellular apoptosis in the pancreatic β-cells and promote β-cell proliferation,15 the positive effect of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on insulin and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C opens new avenues to counteract the potentially deleterious effects on vascular function related to post-prandial spikes in glucose and lipid.",ba965814-8d08-4547-9a5f-06e25199e6ed
