0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design We used a cross-sectional study design. A total sample of 238 participants with T2D and 238 sex- and age-matched participants without diabetes were recruited. This was a sub-study using the cohorts of two previously published studies [20,21]: the first one included a cohort of subjects with T2D designed to assess their quality of life and treatment satisfaction; the second study was a population-based cohort study designed to assess the prevalence of prediabetes, and risk factors associated with this condition. Participants with T2D were recruited at the University Hospital Arnau de Vilanova in Lleida (Spain), the reference specialized hospital for the province of Lleida. Non-diabetic individuals were randomly selected from the population-based study from the same area to match the age and sex distribution of the T2D group. In the T2D group, the inclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosis of T2D, and age between 40 and 75 years.",b4578fc7-d3db-4639-ab3b-e2428eaec5d9
1,methods1," The exclusion criteria were as follows: being a healthcare professional, participants who showed cognitive deterioration, such as dementia and mental diseases; presence of macrovascular complications (i.e., heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and peripheral arterial disease), previous diabetic foot disease, macroalbuminuria (defined as a urine albumin/creatinine ratio over 300 mcg/g), renal failure (defined as a glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min), and the presence of any condition that required specific medical nutrition therapy (MNT) (e.g., pregnancy). In the group without diabetes, the inclusion criteria were participants aged over 25 years and belonging to the specific primary health care area. The exclusion criteria were the same as in the T2D group, together with the diagnosis of diabetes. More details on the characteristics of the two study groups are described in the previous publications [20,21].",65e81f32-f9b0-4b61-992d-27635147be3b
2,methods2," The recruitment of both studies occurred between March 2010 and July 2014. The Ethics committee of the University Hospital Arnau de Vilanova of Lleida (CEIC 1079) approved both studies. Written informed consent was obtained from each of the study participants.  2.2. Clinical Variables Medical records were thoroughly reviewed to collect clinical and sociodemographic data. Blood samples and anthropometric variables were collected by standardized methods; these were detailed in previous publications [20,21]. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were defined as receiving medication for these given conditions (i.e. antihypertension and lipid-lowering drugs, respectively). Physical activity was determined using the validated method of Bernstein et al. [22]; this was classified as sedentary if the expenditure energy was <10% of the daily energy expenditure from performing any physical activity that requires at least 4 METS (The Metabolic Equivalents; i.e.",46947196-713a-4986-8eb0-8a15d40d9514
3,methods3,", walking or cycling for more than 25 min/day), and as regular physical activity when the participant spent >10% of the expenditure energy with any of these activities. According to the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)), one MET is defined as the energy cost of sitting quietly and is equivalent to a caloric consumption of 1 Kcal/Kg/h [23]. Educational level was classified as no university if the participant did not have a university degree, or graduate, or higher if he/she had a university education. Tobacco exposure included current and former smokers.  2.3. Dietary Assessment The food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) designed by Willet et al., adapted and validated for a Spanish population, was individually administered to each of the study participants [24,25,26]. This is a semiquantitative questionnaire based on the Nurse’s Health Study and used in our previous publications [27].",019ea7fd-c8de-4601-a1fe-fbcd2abe9241
4,methods4," This 101-item questionnaire collects data on food consumption over the previous year prior to the visit [28]. Moreover, this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) has been used to estimate the nutritional intake and food consumption up to a period of 6 years, with demonstrated good reproducibility [26]. More details of this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were described in a previous publication [26].  The dietary pattern was assessed using two dietary quality indexes (i.e., aMediterranean Diet score (MED) and aHealthy Eating Index (HEI)) [17,18,19]. The aMediterranean Diet score (MED) includes nine key components of the traditional MedDiet: fruits (including nuts and seeds), vegetables (not including potatoes), legumes, cereals (only whole grain), dairy products, fish, meat (not including poultry), monounsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratio and alcohol consumption.",9e1bcc5f-c17e-42cd-b41d-a73c8eff8863
5,methods5," One point was given to the components that are typically representative of the MedDiet (legumes, fruits, vegetables, cereals, and fish). This score ranges from 0 (minimal adherence) to 9 (maximal adherence) [17,19]. The aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) was calculated according to the criteria of McCullough et al. [18]; this index includes vegetables, fruit, nuts and soy, meat (white and red), cereal fiber, trans fat, polyunsaturated and saturated fat, and alcohol consumption. The score was determined excluding long-term multivitamin use, with ranges from 0 (low quality diet) to 80 (high quality diet).  Nutrient values were obtained from the food composition tables of the US Department of Agriculture and other published sources for Spanish and English foods and portion sizes [29,30,31]. In addition, we used the Spanish food composition tables to avoid an overestimation of nutrient intake from the fortified dairy products in the US.",667678ea-03ed-44a5-bce1-ba59ba9dbeff
6,methods6," Finally, daily food consumption and nutrient intake were adjusted for energy intake.  2.4. Statistical Analysis Descriptive analysis between both groups (T2D and non-diabetes) was performed. The quantitative variables were described using the mean and standard deviation (SD) or the median and interquartile range, according to the normal and non-normal distributions. Categorical variables were summarized using the absolute (n) and relative (%) frequencies. The dietary quality indexes were classified divided in tertiles, from T1 (low adherence) to T3 (high adherence). Statistical significance was determined using the Chi-squared test to assess the differences between the frequencies. The t-Student test was performed to assess the differences between quantitative variables. The method of Benjamini and Hochberg (“BH” and “BY”) was performed to control the false discovery rate and the expected proportion of false discoveries among the rejected hypothesis [32].",148487a6-545f-41cb-862e-4be8c97f0c3d
7,methods7," The relationship between both groups in terms of dietary quality indexes was assessed with multivariable logistic models adjusting for potential confounders (these were variables statistically significant in the bivariate analysis or clinically associated with diabetes). The multivariable logistic models were designed to explain the higher tertiles of aMediterranean Diet score (MED) and aHealthy Eating Index (HEI). The goodness-of-fit assumption using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test for logistic models was assessed. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to estimate the measures. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all the tests.  3. Results Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of both study groups are shown in Table 1. Participants with T2D had a higher body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) (p < 0.001), waist circumference (p < 0.001), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (p < 0.001), and triglyceride concentration (p < 0.",d3c618f1-c08c-4608-a8f6-90ff415e3594
8,methods8,"001) in comparison with the control group. Moreover, participants with T2D were more sedentary than the controls (49.8% vs. 70.5% for regular physical activity; p < 0.001). Furthermore, participants with T2D showed a higher frequency of hypertension and dyslipidemia (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). Despite total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol being lower in participants with T2D, triglyceride concentration was higher in this study group (p < 0.001); HDL-cholesterol was also lower in participants with T2D (p < 0.001).  3.1. Dietary Pattern The adherence to the MedDiet and healthy eating patterns (measured with the aMediterranean Diet score (MED) and aHealthy Eating Index (HEI), respectively) are shown in Table 2. Participants with T2D had a higher adherence to the MedDiet and a healthier eating pattern with higher aMediterranean Diet score (MED) and aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) scores (mean (SD): 4.3 (1.5) and 43.9 (6.5), respectively) in comparison with the control group (3.",55d99b8e-7898-4652-a851-f44b41b9c4ae
9,methods9,"5 (1.8) and 39.4 (7.4), respectively; p < 0.001). Moreover, there was a higher proportion of participants with T2D in higher tertiles of aMediterranean Diet score (MED) (21.8% for T2D vs. 11.3% for controls, p < 0.001) and aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) (39.9% for T2D vs. 19.3% for controls; p < 0.001). These differences between the groups are the result of specific differences in terms of daily food consumption and nutrient intake (Table A1 and Table A2, respectively). Participants with T2D showed a higher intake of dairy products (p = 0.011), white meat (p = 0.002), lean fish (p = 0.002), and fish (p = 0.039) (Table A1); furthermore, T2D participants had a lower intake of bread (p = 0.016) and salt (p < 0.001) in comparison with the control group. On the other hand, participants with T2D showed a higher intake of prepared meals (p = 0.009) and non-alcoholic beverages (p = 0.011) than the controls.",819e4a66-f393-4621-9ae8-780593a4c803
10,methods12,"  3.3. Factors Related with the Dietary Pattern in Type 2 Diabetes The adjusted multivariable analysis including only the T2D group showed that increasing age (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03–1.11, p < 0.001) and dyslipidemia (OR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.13–4.06, p = 0.021) were positively associated with the highest tertile of the aMediterranean Diet score (MED) score (Figure 2a). On the other hand, the multivariable analysis for the aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) showed that female gender (OR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.13–4.92, p = 0.025) was related with higher aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) scores in T2D (Figure 2b). We did not find any association between HbA1c or body mass index (BMI) with aMediterranean Diet score (MED) and aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) (data not shown).  4. Discussion Our findings show that participants with T2D had a healthier dietary pattern with higher aMediterranean Diet score (MED) and aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) scores in comparison with a group without diabetes.",b438ab81-c1d7-4ee8-8b91-59818dc397ab
11,methods13," High scores for both dietary quality indexes were positively associated with T2D, increasing age, and the practice of physical activity. Furthermore, the aMediterranean Diet score (MED) score was also associated with the presence of dyslipidemia, while the aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) score was related with female gender. In participants with T2D, age, and dyslipidemia were associated with higher aMediterranean Diet score (MED) score and female gender was related with higher aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) score.  Participants with T2D showed a higher adherence to the MedDiet and a healthier eating pattern compared with the control group; this is in contrast with the findings of a cross-sectional study performed on a small sample of participants in Ireland (n = 65 with T2D and n = 46 controls) [9]. However, apart from the small number of subjects, this study showed a great deal of missing data on the nutritional and dietary intake data that could have influenced the final results.",754e9546-7f4d-4d4f-9c8e-dcca1feed86f
12,methods14," Furthermore, in contrast with our results, the study by Vidal-Peracho et al., also conducted in Spain, found that subjects without diabetes had a higher adherence to the MedDiet in comparison with a group with both types of diabetes (type 1 and type 2) [10]. The analysis, including a group of both types of diabetes, also could affect the results due to the remarkable differences in the characteristics between T1D and T2D. Furthermore, our results were also discordant with those of Huffman et al. [8]; they found a lower aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) in Haitian American and African American participants with T2D in comparison with a control group even though participants with T2D had a higher Healthy Eating Index (HEI).",143fec39-d732-4d6d-82a4-da5646d0ebe1
13,methods15," However, the aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) is an alternative score adapted from the original Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and is a better predictor of chronic disease risk due to a stronger inverse association with cardiovascular risk in comparison with the original Healthy Eating Index (HEI) [18]. On the other hand, our results showed that the control group had a poorer adherence to the MedDiet; these findings are consistent with previous studies performed on large samples of healthy Spanish participants such as the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Spanish cohort (n = 41,078), the SUN study (n = 13,609) and the ENRICA study (n = 12,948) [33,34,35].  In our Mediterranean country, participants with T2D receive medical nutrition therapy (MNT) focused on the MedDiet pattern and healthy eating. This could explain the association between the higher tertiles of aMediterranean Diet score (MED) and aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) with the presence of T2D.",5c7233a6-4dba-4772-a858-6caad541bd1e
14,methods16," Moreover, increasing age and physical activity were associated with higher aMediterranean Diet score (MED) and aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) scores; this is similar to a prospective study performed with a large sample of women without T2D that found a positive association between aMediterranean Diet score (MED) and aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) with increasing age and physical activity [36]. Furthermore, the Nurse’s Health Study also found that a higher aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) was related with regular physical activity in women [37]. However, our results indicate that the presence of dyslipidemia was associated with a higher aMediterranean Diet score (MED) score. Scientific studies published about this issue found that the MedDiet reduces the risk of T2D improving postprandial lipemia, lipid profile, and cardiovascular risk factors [3,4,38,39,40,41,42,43].",ad03051f-4458-4a79-b013-d5ca6b63f89e
15,methods17," Our results could be due to the fact that participants with dyslipidemia may have received specific dietary counselling based on the MedDiet to improve their lipid profile. Finally, female gender was related with a high aHealthy Eating Index (HEI); this is in line with previous studies that observed a healthier eating in women [13,36,37]. In contrast, other cross-sectional studies did not find differences between both sexes [15,16], and Vidal-Peracho et al. found that men had higher MedDiet scores in comparison with women [10]. The fact that gender was only associated with aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) may be explained by the differences on how each of the indexes used, aMediterranean Diet score (MED) and aHealthy Eating Index (HEI), measure the contribution of each of the components to the final score; actually, the lack of gender association with aMediterranean Diet score (MED) may be mainly explained by the difference in how they assess alcohol consumption, i.e.",c67e95a4-3ebf-41f6-9524-810891f57460
16,methods18,", aHealthy Eating Index (HEI) scores alcohol intake, taking into account the different recommended alcohol consumption between men and women.  This study has some limitations. First, the cross-sectional study design did not allow us to establish a causal relationship between variables and study outcomes. Furthermore, this was a sub-study of previous studies, mainly designed to assess the quality of life and treatment satisfaction of participants with T2D [20], and the prevalence of prediabetes [21]. Although these findings may reflect the educational dietary intervention received from healthcare professionals, we cannot establish a direct link, as we did not assess the specific knowledge about the dietary recommendations in participants with diabetes.",0b380c01-3270-4bd5-b7ce-a98f93fa2538
17,methods19," Furthermore, the relationship between higher adherence to the MedDiet and healthy eating with the presence of type 2 diabetes could be, at least, partly explained by a social desirability bias; however, there was no association of higher adherence to a healthy eating pattern and factors could be related to social desirability, like lower body mass index (BMI) or improved HbA1c. However, this study was performed with a large and well-defined sample of participants. The use of this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) can estimate the nutrient intake and food consumption of the previous five-year period from the visit with a good reproducibility of the dietary habits [25,26]. Furthermore, this is the first study designed to assess the differences in the dietary pattern (i.e., MedDiet and healthy eating) of the participants with T2D in comparison with a control group from the same population.",4645a602-586f-46f5-9166-a05b21683375
18,methods20," Therefore, these results can be potentially important to establish new approaches for medical nutrition therapy (MNT) in people with diabetes.  5. Conclusions Participants with T2D had a higher adherence to the MedDiet and a healthier eating pattern in comparison with a group without diabetes. Further research is needed to establish a causal relationship and definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) in this population.
