0,introduction0,"Endocannabinoids are long chain omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA))-derived lipid mediators involved in energy metabolism in brain and peripheral tissues1. The two endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine (acid (FA) derived mediators including the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA)) and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), are endogenous agonists of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB22. N-acyl-ethanolamines (NAEs) and 2-monoacyl-glycerols (2‑MAGs), the congeners of acid (FA) derived mediators including the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and 2-AG, respectively, do not activate the CB1 and CB2 receptors efficiently. Instead, these congeners activate other receptors (e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR))-α/γ, G-protein coupled receptors (G protein coupled receptors (GPR)) 55, 110, 119, TRPV1 channels), which, unlike CB1, are known to counteract metabolic disorders in animal models3–5.",8d25bcc9-7c19-4ea4-836d-97ee8d6c3c86
1,introduction1," These congeners along with acid (FA) derived mediators including the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and 2-AG, however, have the property of being mostly produced an inactivated by the same enzymes2. All these biomolecular entities, together with other bioactive long chain fatty acid amides, their receptors and metabolic enzymes, form a major extension of the endocannabinoid system, known as the endocannabinoidome2.  NAEs and 2-MAGs interact with different receptors, distributed in several tissues and exerting pleiotropic and sometimes opposing metabolic effects. One of the most accepted roles of endocannabinoids is the regulation of energy metabolism through CB1, in particular by increasing food intake, inhibiting energy expenditure and favouring fat accumulation in the adipose tissue1,6,7. Indeed, CB1 antagonists have been developed for the treatment of obesity and its consequences8–10, and the levels of the main endocannabinoid were linked with adiposity in several studies11–18.",a2fa8b75-ab51-42ad-939c-1cc6f79dbd70
2,introduction2,"  A limited number of studies documented a relationship between dietary lipid intakes and circulating 2‑MAGs and NAEs. Long-term oil supplementation providing specific fatty acids (FA) was found to alter the levels of some NAEs and 2-AG14,19. Also, a positive association was found between the plasma composition of free FAs and some of their corresponding NAEs20. Moreover, gut microbiota composition has been associated with the endocannabinoidome in obesity-related dysbiosis or when altering bacterial populations with antibiotics and probiotics21–26. Gut bacterial communities and the host endocannabinoidome seem to be interrelated in a mutual crosstalk controlling whole body metabolism, but this association remains to be defined in humans25,27. Recent studies showed that some NAEs directly affect mice gut microbiota composition in vivo and in vitro whereas, in turn, germ-free mice exhibit significant alterations in the gut levels of these mediators26,28.",20f77f17-98a4-4c7d-ba7d-37630ad20785
3,introduction3,"  These findings support the hypothesis that, beyond body composition, dietary FA intake and gut microbiota, two potentially related factors, may determine the levels of NAEs and 2‑MAGs in humans29. Yet, very few data are available for most NAEs and 2‑MAGs and little is known on their correlations with body composition, the dietary intakes and gut microbiota composition. The present study aims at filling this knowledge gap by using a heterogeneous and overall healthy population examined either under free or controlled feeding conditions.

We first correlated individual circulating NAE and 2-MAG levels with bacterial family relative abundances (Fig. 3A, Top). As endocannabinoidome and gut microbiota are both correlates of adiposity measures, these associations were further adjusted for total or visceral fat mass, separately for NAEs and 2‑MAGs respectively. We mainly observed that the relative abundance of Christensenellaceae was negatively associated, while those of Peptostreptoccocaceae and Veillonellaceae families were positively associated, with several NAEs independently of adiposity measures.

20,results10,"    Short-term dietary intervention We next assessed whether the circulating levels of NAEs and 2-MAGs were impacted by a short-term isocaloric dietary intervention reflective of the Mediterranean diet. Noteworthy, a 2‑day Mediterranean diet period was sufficient to increase the levels of most omega‑3-FA-derived endocannabinoidome mediators (i.e. Epalmitoyl‑ethanolamine (PEA), docosahexaenoyl‑ethanolamine (DHEA), 2‑EPG and 2‑DHG) compared with values measured after the 13-day control diet (Fig. 4). Similarly, NAEs and 2‑MAGs derived from oleic acid (i.e. oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) and 2-OG) were increased after 2 days on the Mediterranean diet. These results are consistent with higher intakes of oleic acid as well as of EPA and DHA during the Mediterranean diet compared to the control diet.",ed1d92f9-0f47-41b0-9a31-4a77103aa26c

23,discussion1," The endocannabinoidome-related mediators investigated—the NAEs (acid (FA) derived mediators including the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) congeners) and the 2‑MAGs (2-AG congeners)—share the same metabolic pathways with endocannabinoids but act on additional/different receptors [for review, see40]. We report that body composition and fat distribution are strongly associated to the circulating levels of almost all NAEs and 2-MAGs. However, specific patterns were observed in each family—NAEs being associated with the total fat mass and 2-MAGs mainly driven by specific fat accumulation in the visceral compartments. Independent of the total or visceral fat mass, several NAE and 2-MAG congeners were associated with self-reported intake of the corresponding FA precursors and modified by a short-term dietary intervention.",e5a76242-658a-48aa-a7fc-b5af5869e03a
24,discussion2," Moreover, the relative abundance of some bacterial families, such as Veillonellaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae and Akkermansiaceae, were independently correlated with the blood levels of several members of the NAE or 2-MAG families of lipids.  Adiposity measures have been previously reported as strong correlates of circulating levels of endocannabinoids13,17,18. We corroborate these findings and we further demonstrate that their congeners, except oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA), are also correlated with body composition and fat distribution. Interestingly, we revealed that NAEs and 2-MAGs are differently associated with these variables. Individuals characterized by subcutaneous adipose tissue accumulation have greater levels of NAEs compared to lean individuals, while those characterized by visceral adipose tissue accumulation have greater levels of both NAEs and 2‑MAGs.",98c79fa6-adde-4c68-9d71-d7e97a4365d3
25,discussion3," Previous studies have observed higher circulating levels of 2-AG, but not of acid (FA) derived mediators including the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), in individuals with high intra-abdominal adiposity compared to lean or obese individuals with low intra-abdominal adiposity17,18. Our results strengthen the link between circulating 2-AG levels and visceral adipose tissue and extend this knowledge to all 2-AG congeners.  We could posit that production of NAEs and 2-MAGs by specific adipose tissue compartment contribute to their circulating levels, but this remains to be demonstrated. Indeed, more studies are needed to infer the direction of causality, if any, of total or visceral fat mass and circulating levels of NAEs and 2‑MAGs. Intriguingly, we found that total and visceral fat mass are associated with elevated levels of lipid mediators known to activate a wide range of receptors that are associated with likely detrimental (i.e. CB1) and beneficial (e.g.",9bec9e0e-73f9-43ca-9eaf-43fd9386fc30

The lack of detailed affinity and specificity data for each mediator, especially omega-3-FA-derived NAEs and 2-MAGs, for these receptors, and the paucity of information regarding the exact role of some of these proteins in the context of adipocyte biology, do not allow to draw a definitive portrait of endocannabinoidome tone in relation to adipose tissue accumulation and distribution. We speculate that endocannabinoidome mediators modulate fat accumulation and distribution via their actions on food intake, lipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, among others. Conversely, excess accumulation or distribution of fat may lead to altered circulating levels of NAEs and 2‑MAGs as either adaptive or maladaptive responses.",aba4fe42-9ea1-45ed-80e8-3a4b4e6a0da7
27,discussion5,"  Interestingly, the association between NAEs and adiposity measures was not observed for oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA). Côté et al. also report such a discordant relationship between acid (FA) derived mediators including the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA)18. Moreover, experiments in rodents showed that small intestine production of oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) is disrupted in the gut following diet-induced obesity41. Despite being closely related to acid (FA) derived mediators including the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) is not a ligand of CB1 and CB2 receptors2.",1a389e60-1bd7-48d0-8dc8-4dd7a982bdb9
28,discussion6," oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) is involved in the regulation of satiety signals by fat sensing in the gut via peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR)α signaling42, but also promotes fat oxidation, incretin release and reduces upper gut motility via peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR)α and G protein coupled receptors (GPR)119-dependent and -independent mechanisms43. The key and specific role of oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) as a fat sensor in the proximal small intestine and, subsequently, as an inhibitor of the intake of fat may necessitate that the levels of this mediator are independent from the pre-existing amounts of body fat, and hence may explain why they are not associated with adiposity measures, unlike other NAEs.",aa0a8c8d-1b5d-4c25-b817-5da16b29f570
29,discussion7,"  The lack of a clear association between self-reported macronutrient intake and the profile of endocannabinoid-related effectors is rather surprising considering their link with metabolic variables and their alleged role at the crossroad of the environment and the host energy homeostasis44. Nevertheless, we observed interesting effects when investigating individual FA species in both the cross-sectional and dietary intervention studies. We revealed that omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-derived NAEs and 2‑MAGs were responsive to the dietary intake of their corresponding FA precursors. It was not surprising to find slightly different associations as these differences likely reflect the fact that NAEs and 2‑MAGs are ultimately derived from FAs differentially sensitive to different dietary FAs.",d8edf4cc-d2c3-4baf-a2ff-3ecc86683919
30,discussion8," Our data may lead to the speculation that dietary omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s ultimately become amidated to the ethanolamine moiety of phosphatidylethanolamine more than other FAs, thereby yielding to N‑acylphosphatidylethanolamine and serving as a source of NAEs2.  Regimen-induced increase of oleic acid and omega-3 FAs, such as with a Mediterranean diet, resulted in significant and similar increases in both the NAEs and 2-MAGs derived from these FAs. The levels of 2-AG, although positively associated with increased self-reported intake of arachidonic acid, remained stable during the dietary intervention poorer in this FA. This lack of sensitivity to acutely reduce arachidonic acid intake may arise from elongation/desaturation of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid prior to its incorporation into phospholipids and, ultimately, NAEs and 2-MAGs. Accordingly, 2‑LG and linoleoyl ethanolamine (LEA) levels did not increase following the Mediterranean diet.",79c46abd-32f1-4dec-ae57-db00421b7057
31,discussion9,"  Noteworthy, we demonstrate that these relations with intakes of specific FA precursors were independent of adiposity measures. In fact, other studies had shown that omega-3-FA supplementation decreases circulating acid (FA) derived mediators including the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and 2‑AG levels and increases omega-3-derived congeners (i.e. Epalmitoyl‑ethanolamine (PEA))14,19,45,46, while monounsaturated FAs (MUFA) supplementation promotes higher circulating oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) levels19. Joosten et al. also showed that acid (FA) derived mediators including the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) and palmitoyl‑ethanolamine (PEA) were correlated to circulating levels of the corresponding FA precursors20. However, the role of adiposity and fat distribution in these effects was not investigated.",de3f430a-84fd-42e2-b485-fb8f901c9efc
32,discussion10," Our study clearly indicates that the profile of dietary FAs is a key independent determinant of the wider endocannabinoidome in circulation, not only using self-reported dietary intake data, but also following a short-term dietary intervention.  Since recent studies showed that NAEs in the small intestine are elevated in germ-free mice, and that a cocktail of acid (FA) derived mediators including the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), palmitoyl‑ethanolamine (PEA), oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) and linoleoyl ethanolamine (LEA) promotes in vitro growth of some mouse gut bacteria taxa, including those belonging to the family Veillonellaceae, we have investigated here whether gut microbiota are associated with these mediators28.",04b7ec57-b24a-460c-948b-37db8fa9dcb9
33,discussion11," We found that, indeed, increased relative abundance of some bacterial families, including not only Veillonellaceae, but also Christensenellaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae and Akkermansiaceae, can be associated with circulating endocannabinoidome mediators, independently of adiposity and dietary FA intakes. Bacteria in the Veillonellaceae family, which were correlated positively with non-omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-derived NAEs, produce short-chain FAs (short chain FAs (SCFA)), especially propionate, associated with metabolic health47. Interestingly, Veillonellaceae genera seem differently associated with host metabolism: whilst the relative abundance of Phascolarctobacterium at baseline was negatively associated with adiposity, the opposite was found for the Dialister and Megamonas genera48. In the present study, we found that two genera from the Veillonellaceae family, Megamonas and Dialister, were associated to NAEs.",34c2ea96-a445-4ae2-bb56-07147dd425af
34,discussion12," It was suggested that members of the Veillonellaceae family have varying impact on energy metabolism, and, in view the different roles of acid (FA) derived mediators including the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) and linoleoyl ethanolamine (LEA) in this context, our results reinforce this hypothesis. Christensenellaceae is one of the most consistently associated families with adiposity49. Indeed, the relative abundance of Christensenellaceae was inversely related to host BMI in different populations and to the presence of several diseases, including obesity and inflammatory bowel disease50–52. Very little data are available for the Peptostreptococcaceae family, as well as for its Romboutsia and the Terrisporobacter genera, and their link with metabolism.",047aae13-48b4-4b16-8b1f-235faefcf5f0
35,discussion13," A potential link reported between polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake and this group of diverse anaerobes with fermentative type of metabolism29, may support its association, observed here, with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-derived NAEs. Finally, strong evidence supports the role of Akkermansiaceae, especially A. muciniphila, in metabolic health53. The present finding of a negative association of Akkermansiaceae with circulating 2‑EPG, and of Marinifilaceae and Pasteurellaceae with circulating 2-DPG, two poorly studied 2-AG congeners, remains to be clarified. In summary, we show that dietary FA intakes and adiposity are not the only determinants of circulating endocannabinoidome mediators, and that NAEs are associated with different families of bacteria in the human gut microbiota, in agreement with previous mechanistic studies in rodents.",5f7bc696-5d58-4c6b-a939-0a99467e837a
36,discussion14,"  The fact that both self-reported FA intakes and very short term consumption of a Mediterranean diet rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and oleic acid can determine the profile of circulating endocannabinoidome mediators, independently of adiposity measures, is a key finding of this study and supports the concept that nutritional approaches may rapidly and profoundly affect the levels of these bioactive lipids. We also highlight the importance of carefully considering total and visceral adiposity in the design of studies aimed at measuring circulating NAEs and 2‑MAGs. More importantly, controlled feeding studies or a precise assessment of self-reported FAs dietary intake should be carried out before blood or tissue sampling for NAEs and 2‑MAGs profiling.",015e19ba-9eef-479f-9f8b-efe1d0ec87b4
37,discussion15," Altogether, the results obtained here justify and may help designing future dietary interventions aimed at manipulating endocannabinoidome signaling to exploit the capability of various endocannabinoid congeners in producing potential beneficial effects on obesity and its comorbidities43,45,54. Finally, following our finding that some NAEs and 2‑MAGs are also associated with gut microbiota composition, interventions aimed at modulating the levels of these mediators might also find application in counteracting the metabolic disturbances linked to gut dysbiosis26,27,55,56.
