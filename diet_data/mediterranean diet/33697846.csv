4,analysis0," Data were analyzed using RevMan software (Review Manager Version 5.3.5, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen). For our study, sample size, and the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the endothelial function measurements for pre and post-intervention periods (for both MedDiet intervention and control) were extracted and used in the analyses. When studies used more than 1 method to evaluate changes in endothelial function (Table 1), the compounding factor was taken into consideration by estimating the mean of the standardized effect sizes in order to prevent the overestimation of effect sizes. Effect sizes and 95% CIs for the MedDiet interventions were calculated using a weighted DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model [25]. Forest plots were generated to evaluate the compound effect of the Mediterranean diet on endothelial function. Two strata were made for endothelial function measurement, structural and functional.",0cbf6a80-8865-4c3f-999c-ea70a25ea844
5,analysis1," Functional measurements include flow mediated dilation (FMD) derived from ultrasound, forearm blood flow (forearm blood flow (FBF)) derived from plethysmography, or cutaneous microcirculation derived from laser Doppler. Structural measurements included intima-media thickness or vessel size, both measured by ultrasound. flow mediated dilation (FMD) was used in the majority of the studies as it is a non-invasive, clinical measurement of endothelial function [26]; hence, sensitivity analysis was performed on the effects of MedDiet on flow mediated dilation (FMD) as a majority of the studies reported this value. Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess if any single study disproportionately influenced the results and resulted in an increase in heterogeneity.",f3e10f77-aaa2-4c81-aced-eef0ea5f290f
6,analysis2," Random-effects meta-regression analyses were carried out to check whether participants’ baseline characteristics (such as mean age and body-mass index (BMI)) and duration of studies included modified the impact of MedDiet on endothelial function. Meta-regression was also applied to check for association, if any, between study duration (in weeks) and functional and structural parameters of endothelial function, separately. We investigated the risk of publication bias by funnel plots and Egger’s regression test and statistically assessed by Begg's Test (P > 0.05 as no publication bias). Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q statistic; P < 0.1 indicates significant heterogeneity. Heterogeneity across the trials was also evaluated by the I2 test and the scale was set as a value < 25% which indicates low risk; 25–75% indicates moderate risk; and > 75% indicates high risk [27]. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant in all cases.",0a393ca0-a904-4a8f-97be-d7e22db771db

13,results2," Five studies examined the effect of the MedDiet on a healthy population [20, 28, 34, 36, 40], 3 in the diabetic population [30, 35, 40], 2 in people with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [37, 38], 1 in patients with metabolic syndrome [20], 1 with pre-diabetics patients [40], 1 in patients with the acute coronary syndrome [39], 1 in hypercholesterolemic men [32], 1 in patients with coronary heart disease [40], 1 in obese patients [29], and 1 in overweight patients [33]. Various combinations of the MedDiet were employed such as a MedDiet only (n = 8), MedDiet plus supplementary nuts (n = 2), MedDiet plus supplementary extra virgin olive oil (n = 5), MedDiet plus mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)s (n = 3), and MedDiet plus exercise (n = 1).",eb549879-e6e8-4c15-9ee7-5397edc0353b

In the included studies, there were several methods and parameters taken into account to investigate endothelial function, of which the most frequently used methods were flow mediated dilation (FMD) and carotid intima-media thickness.

18,discussion0," Overall, with the inclusion of 15 studies involving 2735 participants, this meta-analysis shows that a MedDiet can improve endothelial function as we observed favorable effects in both healthy individuals and those with an increased likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Furthermore, subgroup analyses showed that the effect was stronger on functional parameters of endothelial function in comparison to structural parameters. A previous meta-analysis evaluating this association reported a 40% lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) following MedDiet [42], whereas another study suggested a reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk following a MedDiet to be approximately 24% stronger compared to the respective control groups [43]. In preceding systematic reviews and meta-analyses, Shannon et al. [44] reported positive results with a MedDiet intervention. In particular, the meta-analysis highlighted that the MedDiet increased flow mediated dilation (FMD) by 1.",a46b4de4-75c1-44ca-b4e8-d3e582ca62fb
19,discussion1,"66%, which reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by ~ 22%. This was calculated using the findings predicted by Inaba et al. [45] that a 13% decrease in the risk of cardiovascular events occurs per 1% increase in flow mediated dilation (FMD) [44]. Thus, with a 1.39% increase in flow mediated dilation (FMD) in our meta-analysis, the decrease in risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is approximately 18%.  The MedDiet can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by improving endothelial function through several different mechanisms such as by (a) protecting against oxidative stress, inflammation, and platelet aggregation (b) modifying cancer-related hormones and growth factors (c) by having a lipid-lowering effect, and (d) by modulating gut microbiota-mediated production of metabolites influencing metabolic health [46].",38afa90a-b588-40c3-bd02-9787c3dbd29c
20,discussion2," Additionally, it can significantly decrease blood lipid levels of low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)), apolipoprotein B, and cholesterol which ultimately improves endothelial function. Oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) promotes endothelial dysfunction as it plays an important role in creating an environment for inflammation and lipid accumulation within vessels, which can lead to the development of atherosclerosis [47]. The MedDiet improves vasomotor function and decreases low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by decreasing P-selectin in plasma. In addition, mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), a major component of MedDiet, also improves endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic men, thus reducing the risk of atherosclerotic plaque formation and decreasing cholesterol levels [32].",9f5a04be-fe9e-4e74-ace0-b441a08f008c
21,discussion3," Studies have also shown that MedDiet increases high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) plasma levels while decreasing low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation so it is used for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [48]. HDL has many cardioprotective benefits; its plasma levels increase due to the Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil [49].  The MedDiet is a complex diet enriched by foods such as nuts, legumes, and fish. All of which are key sources of l-arginine, an amino acid that can be utilized to enhance nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. NO accounts for the relaxation of vascular tone [4, 50] and inhibition of platelet aggregation [51] as well as platelet adhesion [52]. The importance of l-arginine in amounts 4–24 g per day can be seen through cardiovascular benefits such as reduced BP wherein systolic and diastolic BP can decrease by approximately 5- and 3-mm Hg, respectively.",cbc21e91-8cb7-4381-b9cc-1bf0ef2995b4
22,discussion4," Additionally, nitrate is also an important precursor for NO production and can be found in vegetables, which are included in the MedDiet; nitrate also presents with similar benefits [53].  Another known effect of the MedDiet is on inflammatory markers. Prior studies have reported that some components of the MedDiet such as nuts may downregulate inflammatory markers related to atherosclerosis, such as serum C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)), interleukin 6 (IL-6), cell adhesion molecule-1 (CAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [54]. For example, C reactive protein (CRP) reduces endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity which subsequently reduces vasodilator effects of NO and increases vasoconstrictor effects of Endothelin-1 (ET-1) all of which increases the chances of atherosclerosis and clot formation [42]. This downregulation of inflammatory markers leads to improvements in endothelial function.",1d7e3421-bb6a-41e8-a067-3dd87c657ce2
23,discussion5,"  The overall quality of the studies involved in our meta-analysis was moderate. In most RCTs, the participants were aware of the intervention while the information was kept confidential in a few studies. This can be viewed as a notable limitation, keeping in mind that expectation bias can play its part, where the anticipation of beneficial effects can produce the most advantageous outcome. At the same time, it has been observed that blinding patients in a clinical trial, in which the intervention is a diet, is a difficult task to achieve. In some of the studies, analysis of endothelial function was done more than once during the trial period, so for studies with a longer period of intervention, this may have impacted the results. To eliminate doubts of having biases in our study related to intermediate measurements of endothelial function, we opted for a systematic approach by including only the last measurement in our study.",2c6e44fd-874d-4fba-98be-fefe01151414
24,discussion6,"  We revised previous meta-analysis and offer the most recent data. Our meta-analysis results are similar with earlier meta-analysis findings, bolstering the notion that MedDiet is helpful in decreasing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and flow mediated dilation (FMD) risk values. Furthermore, our findings open the door to additional research that should be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of MedDiet in structural aspects of endothelial function using more robust trials. Our findings could aid in the development of MedDiet diet plans and will help improve the guidelines for patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). A limitation of our research was that the mean age of participants was 50 years old, which may have minimally decreased the impact fullness of our results, although meta-regression negates the linkage of effects of the MedDiet with age.",f0be9b90-8960-4696-b04c-56182fa469d2
25,discussion7," Furthermore, because there is no general definition of what defines a MedDiet, the nature of the dietary interventions varied across research, and it is probable that certain MedDiet variations may be more beneficial than others in terms of increasing endothelial function, as evidenced by the substantial degree of heterogeneity in our analyses. Similarly, the control group used had variation that there was no a consistent standard against which the MedDiet was measured, which could lead to the high heterogeneity in our analysis. We only considered those studies in our meta-analysis in which the author mentioned intervention as the MedDiet; therefore, we may have missed some studies in which the MedDiet was directed at patients without using the actual name of the diet, and therefore this can be considered a methodological limitation. More studies are required to evaluate the effect of MedDiet on endothelial function, with larger cohorts and longer durations.",a10abb2c-e687-45ed-992e-197efb69d856
26,discussion8," More robust trials are required to assess the disparities in effects on MedDiet on endothelial function based on gender, age, and previous history of comorbidities so that more rigorous analysis can be performed to better understand the association between MedDiet and endothelial function.  Conclusion  The current meta-analysis depicts that the MedDiet has positive effects on cardiovascular health by improving the functional and structural parameters of endothelial function. We did not observe any variation due to age, BMI, study duration, or study design in the effects of MedDiet on endothelial function. Moreover, the quality of evidence in our research was modest but future clinical trials with a good sample size and age diversity are required to strengthen the proof that the MedDiet has beneficial cardiovascular health effects.
