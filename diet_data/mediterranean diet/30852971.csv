0,introduction0," Behçet’s syndrome (BS) is a systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by a wide range of potential clinical manifestations with no gold-standard therapy [1, 2]. Although the pathogenesis of BS is currently unknown, it has been recently classified as a type of systemic vasculitis [3]. The gut microbiota (GM) is recognized to deeply influence our metabolic and immunological health, and specific dysbiotic GM configurations indicate a fascinating link between intestinal microbes and health status. A recent study from our group [4] showed, for the first time, that a peculiar dysbiosis of the GM is present also in individuals with BS, in line with several other chronic disorders [5–7]. Moreover, individuals with BS have significant depletion of well-known butyrate producers, i.e.",6507ca01-5091-4cca-913e-0a901292942d
1,introduction1," Roseburia and Subdoligranulum, and a consistent decrease in butyrate, one of the most representative short-chain fatty acids (short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s), thus suggesting an increase in the inflammatory state [8, 9].  In this context, over recent years, growing evidence has suggested that high-fiber dietary patterns promote a more favorable GM profile, and are key mediators of microbial diversity [10, 11]. Lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet is characterized by abstention from consuming meat and meat products, poultry, seafood, and flesh from any other animal and by consuming a large amount of plant-derived foods. This dietary pattern has been largely demonstrated to be beneficial both in patients with established disease and in people with with traditional risk factors for chronic diseases [12, 13].",1f26de2e-4fb5-4b41-be92-37e4276a6a2f
2,introduction2," In particular, it has recently been demonstrated that high adherence to a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet is associated with a beneficial GM profile, with enrichment in fiber-degrading bacteria and an increase in fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s [14]. Similarly, other dietary patterns rich in plant-based food, such as the Mediterranean diet, have been shown to modulate GM dysbiosis, by supporting the recovery of a balanced microbial community of health-promoting short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing members with the decrease in pro-inflammatory pathobiont groups [15, 16]. Furthermore, current evidence indicates that the consumption of certain fibers - such as inulin and resistant starch - leads to specific GM rearrangements with consequent butyrate hyperproduction in humans [17].",4e18b764-fd3a-4380-ad8e-2543fb6e8b97
3,introduction3," All these findings let us hypothesize that the adherence to a controlled dietary profile enriched in substrates with potential for butyrate production may select for butyrate-producing bacteria - such as Roseburia spp. and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii - so reversing the pro-inflammatory dysbiosis observed in BS.  Thus, the aim of the present project is to conduct an open, randomized, cross-over dietary intervention trial to investigate whether a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet enriched in substrates with potential for butyrate production or a Mediterranean diet supplemented with butyrate could be beneficial for the GM and the amelioration of the clinical manifestations and disease severity in individuals with BS.

4,background0," Behçet’s syndrome (BS) is a systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, and it is characterized by a wide range of potential clinical manifestations. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiota (GM) in BS has low biodiversity with a significant depletion in butyrate producers. The aim of the present project is to investigate whether a dietary intervention could ameliorate the clinical manifestations and modulate the GM of individuals with BS.

5,methods0," participants, interventions, and outcomes  Study design  The randomized, open, cross-over clinical trial will be conducted at the Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy. A cross-over design will be implemented to allow comparison of a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet (VD), a Mediterranean diet supplemented with butyrate (MD-Bt), and a Mediterranean diet without any supplement (MD), as control, within the same individual. Participants will act as their own controls in cross-over studies, so individual differences will be controlled for, making the error variance smaller and subsequently reducing the sample size required to find a significant effect due to increased statistical power. The study design follows the Standard protocol items: recommendation for interventional trials (Standard protocol items recommendation for interventional trials (SPIRIT)) guidelines (see Fig. 1 and supplementary file #1).

After a 2-week run-in period - which will be used to assess participants’ eligibility and to collect demographic details, signed informed consent, and 3-day dietary records - the eligible participants (N = 90) will be randomly assigned to follow a 3-month dietary profile with a VD, a MD or a MD-Bt. The VD will contain inulin and resistant-starch-rich foods, eggs, and dairy, in addition to plant-based food, but will not contain meat, poultry, or fish. The MD will contain all the food categories and will provide two portions per week of fish and three portions per week of fresh and processed meat (one of which will consist of fresh or processed red meat).

The metric used will be changes in means from the beginning to the end of each dietary intervention. They will include: Severity of gastrointestinal symptoms assessed by the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) modified form. The Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) is a multidimensional rating scale assessing overall symptom severity on a visual analogue scale (visual analogue scale (VAS)). An overall score will be calculated from six items: pain severity, pain frequency, abdominal bloating, dissatisfactory bowel habit, abdominal heaviness, and life interference.",54ada63a-aff0-47d9-b8fa-aff209608f5d
12,methods7," The modified Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) ranges from 0 to 600, with higher scores meaning more severe symptoms.  Improvement of gastrointestinal-related BS symptoms assessed by the Global Assessment of Improvement Scale (GAI) modified form. The Global Assessment of Improvement Scale (GAI) will assess improvement of symptoms of BS using a 7-point scale, with higher scores meaning an improvement in the symptoms. The severity of abdominal pain, severity of abdominal distention, satisfaction with bowel habits, severity of headache, severity of exhaustion, severity of nausea, attention disorder, muscle/joint pain, and quality of life will be investigated in response to the following question: “Compared to the way you felt before you entered the study, have your symptoms over the past 7 days been: 1) “Substantially Worse”, 2)” Moderately Worse, 3)” Slightly Worse”, 4)” No Change”, 5)” Slightly Improved”, 6)” Moderately Improved” or 7) “Substantially Improved”.",5d5fac3a-8dfb-4c2c-a193-3666787f8727

This specific biomarker is the major urinary metabolite of 4- hydroxy-2-nonenal, a lipid peroxidation product.  Sample size calculation  Due to the lack of dietary intervention trials on BS and to the fact that gastrointestinal symptoms are quite similar in BS and inflammatory bowel disease, based on a previously published trial [24], a sample size of 80 individuals with BS is required to achieve power of 80% (beta) with alpha = 0.05, to detect a 50-point difference in the mean of Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) (the primary outcome), between VD and MD interventions.",31cf2e09-fe78-466b-a15a-f90e41affb67

19,methods14,"  Blinding  Although full blinding of both participants and dieticians to treatments in this study is not possible because of obvious differences between the intervention diets, several strategies will be employed to reduce the risk of bias. First of all, the treatment allocation for each individual will not be revealed until the individual has irrevocably been entered into the trial, to avoid selection bias. In addition, outcome measures in the present study cannot be easily influenced by the observer. Furthermore, trial personnel who will enroll participants, data collectors, outcome assessors, and data analysts will be blinded to treatment allocation, and an employee outside of the research team will insert data into the computer in separate datasheets. On the other hand, making the trial open rather than blinded may improve recruitment. Unblinding will be permissible only when knowledge of the treatment will be absolutely essential for further management of the individual.",1ae51a02-a58f-48db-83de-9fb468778a30

This is a randomized, open, cross-over study that involves 90 individuals with BS, who will be randomly assigned to one of three different diets for 3 months: a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet (VD), a Mediterranean diet (MD), or a Mediterranean diet supplemented with butyrate (MD-Bt). The VD will contain inulin-resistant and resistant-starch-rich foods, eggs, and dairy in addition to plant-based food, but it will not contain meat, poultry, or fish.

Alpha diversity and rarefaction curves will be computed using different metrics, including the Faith’s phylogenetic diversity, the number of observed OTUs and the Shannon index. Beta diversity will be estimated by weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances, which will be used as input for principal coordinates analysis (PCoA). All statistical analysis will be performed using R and the packages vegan, stats, and made4. The significance of data separation in the PCoA will be tested using a permutation test with pseudo-F ratios (function Adonis in vegan).

However, to facilitate interpretation, the log data will be again converted to the original scale (antilog) and presented as geometric means with 95% CIs. Spearman correlation coefficients between the changes in microbial composition, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, nutrient intake, and in clinical and biochemical parameters will be computed and statistically tested for each dietary intervention.  Before starting the data analysis, the level, pattern and likely causes of the missingness in the baseline variables and outcomes will be investigated by preparing appropriate tables.

If these show that conclusions may differ based on missing values, then supplementary multiple imputations for missing values will be undertaken. These analyses will account for results of any losses to follow up insofar as they pertain to differences in measured variables (i.e. under the assumption of missing at random). Finally, subgroup analyses will be performed to analyze possible differences in the changes according to some characteristics of the study population, such as age, sex, categories of Body mass index (BMI), and physical activity.

33,discussion0," BS is a systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by a wide range of potential clinical manifestations affecting different organs and tissues [1], with higher risk of mortality due to vascular-thrombotic and neurological affections [2]. The etiology remains unknown, and although various mechanisms have been proposed, it is not yet clear whether the microbiome has a role in this process [28]. To date, no studies are available that evaluate the effects of a nutritional intervention on BS. Thus, the aim of the project will be to understand the effect of a VD, MD-Bt, or MD on the manifestations of BS and, possibly, the role of the intestinal microbiota as a mediator of dietary effects in individuals with BS.  In a recent study by our group [4] there was low biodiversity in the composition of the GM in individuals with BS, and specific changes in the profiles of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production [4].",2cb13c54-b98d-4bc0-999c-f0bb183a15e6
34,discussion1," In particular, a significant depletion of butyrate producers - such as Roseburia and Subdoligranulum - and a consequent decrease in butyrate production was demonstrated. Butyrate is the preferred fuel for colonocytes and one of the most representative short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s. It induces T regulatory cell differentiation through several mechanisms, so butyrate impairment in individuals with BS could promote reduced T regulatory cell-mediated control, thus promoting a powerful immunopathological T cell response [8] as suggested by the higher percentage of T helper (Th1)/Th17 cells in the intestinal mucosa observed in BS [9]. The presence of an altered GM in BS has recently been confirmed by Ye et al. [29] by analyzing fecal and saliva samples collected from 32 individuals with BS and 74 healthy controls. Fecal samples from individuals with BS contained greater levels of Bilophila spp. and several opportunistic pathogens (i.e. Parabacteroides spp. and Paraprevotella spp.",72066307-a121-4c84-a13b-c7e60b6fd12b

These differences have been associated with altered biological microbial functions with an enhanced oxidation–reduction process, a capsular polysaccharide transport system, and type III and IV secretion systems [29].  Increased evidence suggests that dietary patterns characterized by increased amounts of plant-based foods, such as a MD or VD, have positive effects on health status, possibly modulating GM and the production of its metabolites [14, 16, 30]. Indeed, dietary patterns rich in non-refined cereals, fruits, vegetables, and legumes have been found to promote a healthier GM profile due to the large amount of dietary fiber.",16123b67-a51f-49b7-a3fb-2453cfc6297c
36,discussion3," These fermentable substrates are sources of metabolic fuel for the fermentation of GM, which, in turn, results in end products - mainly short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s - that are key microbial metabolites with a multifactorial role in host health [13]. In particular, foods rich in inulin i.e. chicory, artichokes, and onions, and foods rich in resistant starch i.e. cooked and chilled rice, pasta, or potatoes, have been associated with increased butyrate production [17]. In this regard, a recent study by our group [30], which compared microbial and metabolic changes after a 3-month dietary intervention with MD and VD, reported a significant positive association of carbohydrate consumption with fecal butyrate levels and a significant negative association of fat intake with propionate and acetate. Negative associations were also observed between short chain fatty acid (SCFA) and levels of several inflammatory cytokines.",83771aae-9f09-4c71-a8fd-c240e230a2a0
37,discussion4,"  BS is a rare disease, and the available treatments are not specifically tailored therapies. Beyond the real progress made in the treatment of this disease in the past decade, the management of BS remains a challenge for physicians. Increasing evidence demonstrates that it is a disorder with an extremely wide spectrum of clinical features that can respond to certain specific treatments which, however, can be ineffective on other manifestations or even worsen some features. A treatment based on dietary and lifestyle issues, able to restore immune system homeostasis, could have a high impact on cost sustainability in the treatment of such a chronic and disabling inflammatory condition.  Trial status  The trial has received all necessary regulatory approvals. The current approved protocol version is 2.0 (version date 16 April 2018). We anticipate a recruitment start date of 16 September 2019 and a recruitment completion date of 15 June 2020.",3698d4e3-2d86-4b4c-b6b0-edeb54ba9311
