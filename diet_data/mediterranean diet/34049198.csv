0,methods0," Study population  The UK Biobank is a multi-centre, population-based cohort of 502,538 participants aged 42–69 years at recruitment, who were recruited between 2006 and 2010. Participants attended one of the 22 centres across England, Scotland and Wales for baseline assessments for phenotyping, biological sample collection, self-reported questionnaires and nurse interviews. All participants provided informed consent using a signature-capture device. Participants also consented to the linkage of electronic health records from primary care, hospital attendances and death certification to their study data. UK Biobank received ethical approval from the National Information Governance board for Health and Social Care and the National Health Service North West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee in January 2006. We applied to and were given permission to use the UK Biobank data under study number 40055.",d5693784-2da6-40df-8f85-e817910f906a
1,methods1," We restricted our analysis to those individuals with data available across all variables of interest and to those 55 or older at baseline, as a dementia diagnosis in younger participants is likely to be relatively rare and due to factors unrelated to diet. Individuals who were diagnosed with dementia within 3 years of baseline assessments were also excluded.  Exposure  Dietary assessment  Dietary measures were ascertained at baseline via a self-reported electronic Food Frequency Questionnaire with 29 food groups covering average consumption frequency over the past year. Diet-related items included in the current study are processed meats (such as bacon, ham, sausage, meat pies, kebabs, burgers, chicken nuggets), unprocessed poultry, unprocessed beef, unprocessed pork, unprocessed lamb/mutton, oily fish, non-oily fish, dried fruit, fresh fruit, cooked vegetables, raw vegetables, cereal, bread, cheese.",7f873430-c407-4048-b62b-af2a7e39a490
2,methods2," Consumption of meats and fish was assessed with the question: “How often do you eat …?”. For each of the meat, oily and non-oily fish consumption questions, possible answers consisted of 6 categories of weekly intake: “Never”, “Less than once a week”, “Once a week”, “2–4 times a week”, “5–6 times a week”, “Once or more daily”. To assess intake of dried and fresh fruit, participants were asked how many pieces of dried or fresh fruit they would eat a day, and intake was recorded as an integer number of pieces of daily intake. Intake of cooked and raw vegetables was ascertained by asking for average numbers of heaped tablespoons of raw/cooked vegetables consumed per day. For both food groups, participants could select “Less than one” if they ate less than one piece of fruit or heaped spoon of vegetables.  To assess cereal and bread type consumption, participants were asked about which type they mainly ate. There were 5 answer categories for cereal: “Bran cereal (e.g.",3d85858d-1841-43ee-87cd-f4493e74460d
3,methods3," All Bran, Bran flakes)”, “Biscuit cereal (e.g. Weetabix)”, “Oat cereal (e.g. Ready Brek, porridge)”, “Muesli”, “Other (e.g. Cornflakes, Frosties)”. For bread consumption, possible answers consisted of 4 categories: “White”, “Brown”, “Wholemeal or wholegrain”, “Other type of bread”.  To assess intake of cheese, participants were asked “How often do you eat cheese? (Include cheese in pizzas, quiches, cheese sauce etc.)”. Possible answers consisted of 6 categories of weekly intake: “Never”, “Less than once a week”, “Once a week”, “2–4 times a week”, “5–6 times a week”, “Once or more daily”.  For each of the above food questions, participants were instructed to provide an estimate of average intake or select “Do not know” if they were unsure. Additionally, for each question there was an answer category of “Prefer not to answer”.",97add5cf-09de-4838-a992-f426d304557c
4,methods4,"  Quantifying food consumption  The responses on unprocessed beef, pork, poultry, lamb/mutton and processed meat were converted into weekly-based consumption frequencies of 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5.5 and 7 times per week, using the median for each category. Unprocessed beef, pork and lamb/mutton were summed into one group of “unprocessed red meat”, and all meat groups were summed into “total meat”. To rank participants by weekly meat consumption according to the distribution of data, intake frequencies for each meat type was categorised into five groups: processed meat (0, 0.1–0.9, once, 2.0–4.9, ≥ 5.0 times/week), unprocessed red meat (0, 0.1–1.0, 1.1–1.9, 2.0–2.9, ≥ 3.0 times/week), unprocessed poultry (0, 0.1–0.9, once, 2.0–4.9, ≥ 5.0 times/week), total meat (0, 0.1–3.0, 3.1–4.9, 5.0–6.9, ≥ 7.0 times/week).  For both oily and non-oily fish, the responses were converted into weekly based consumption frequencies of 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5.",50676b38-6adf-4d54-b353-9d95b226f00c
5,methods5,"5, 7 times per week, and consumption was summed to provide total fish intake. Intake frequency for fish was categorised into 5 groups (0–0.9, once, 1.1–1.9, 2.0–3.9, ≥ 4.0 times/week).  For consumption of dried and fresh fruit, responses were converted into daily intake—two pieces of dried fruit and one piece of fresh fruit counted as one serving [14].  The items were summed to provide total fruit consumption, and daily servings of fruit were grouped into 5 categories (0–0.9, 1.0–1.9, 2.0–2.9, 3.0–4.0, ≥ 4.5 servings a day).  For consumption of cooked and raw vegetables, the same pattern was followed as for fruit. Two heaped tablespoons of cooked vegetables or raw vegetables were counted as one serving.  Weekly intake frequency of cheese was converted into groups of 6 categories of weekly intake (0, 0.1–0.9, once, 2.0–4.0, 5.0–6.0, daily or more).  Categories for each food group were determined based on data distribution to provide similar-sized groups.",e45ff270-a25c-4c15-aae2-998dedb15f7a
6,methods6,"  Responses from questions on bread type and cereal type were combined to create an index of grain consumption. Participants’ answers on consumption of cereal type were collapsed into two categories of refined grains (muesli, cornflakes, Frosties) and wholegrains (bran cereal, biscuit cereal (Weetabix), oat cereal). Answers on consumption of bread type were also collapsed into two categories of refined grains (white bread) and wholegrains (wholegrain/wholemeal, brown bread). Combining both cereal and bread type answers, a score was generated to reflect the type of grains most commonly consumed with those scoring higher consuming wholegrains more commonly.  Outcome  Incident all-cause dementia cases was the primary outcome, as ascertained through self-report and data linkage to hospital inpatient admissions, primary care records and death registries. Date of diagnosis was set as the earliest date of dementia codes recorded regardless of source used.",68c0fbe5-ae77-494a-b441-bd7dbebea3fd
7,methods7," Diagnoses were recorded using the International Classification of Diseases (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)) coding system 9 and 10 [15, 16]. Across UK Biobank and all three linked databases, the positive predictive value for all-cause dementia has been found to be 82.5% [17].  Covariates  Demographic characteristics were collected at baseline through self-reported electronic questionnaires and physical measurements. Covariates in our analyses were chosen a priori from the literature on the basis of their potential to confound the relationship between diet and dementia. They were grouped into socio-demographic (age, sex, Townsend deprivation index [18], household income, age left education), lifestyle (physical activity, smoking status, alcohol intake), mental health (loneliness and depression) and physical health factors (BMI, total cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular events, major dietary changes in the last 5 years) (Table 1).",d183a2aa-fe07-4c4f-b7b1-02cd406e7044

Baseline characteristics of the sample were summarised for those with and without incident dementia as mean (SD) or median (incident dementia as mean (SD) or median (IQR)) as appropriate for continuous variables and frequency and percentage for categorical variables. Follow-up time was determined as time from baseline to the earliest of dementia diagnosis, loss to follow-up or death. We used Cox proportional hazard regression models for time to dementia diagnosis.  We first conducted univariable Cox regression for each of the six food groups separately (meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, cheese, wholegrains). We then adjusted each separate food group model sequentially for sociodemographic, lifestyle, mental health and physical health covariates. Our final model included all dietary components and was fully adjusted for all covariates.",da563f17-6793-4da0-9972-f5a4eb5cacf5

14,results6," Generally, people who developed dementia were older, lived in more deprived neighbourhoods, had lower household income, were less physically active, had higher blood pressure, were more likely to report diagnoses of diabetes and cardiovascular events and were more likely to report smoking, and feelings of loneliness and depression. More men than women were diagnosed with dementia in the study population. Those who developed dementia were also more likely to report major dietary changes in the past 5 years due to illness.  Individual food components and dementia risk  In the unadjusted model, compared to no consumption of processed meat, consumption of processed meat of more than 5 times a week was associated with increased risk of dementia (Table 3) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.24; 95%CI 1.05–1.46).

16,results14,"  Compared to consumption of less than once a week, intake of fish of between once a week and up to 2.0–3.9 times a week was associated with decreased risk of dementia—an effect present throughout the subsequent adjusted models (fully adjusted model 1.1–1.9 times/week HR 0.81, 95%CI 0.69–0.94; 2.0–3.9 times/week HR 0.80, 95%CI 0.69–0.93).

19,discussion0," In this cohort of people aged 55 and over with long follow-up, we found that once all covariates and other food components were taken into account, individual components of the Mediterranean diet are not associated with dementia risk except for fish consumption and low consumption of fruit.  Initial univariable models showed an increased dementia risk from higher consumption of processed meat, reduced risk from higher consumption of unprocessed meat, reduced risk with increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables and cheese. Most of these effects were no longer statistically significant once sociodemographic factors were adjusted for, and none of these associations except for moderate unprocessed meat consumption, fish consumption and low fruit consumption were statistically significant once all covariates were adjusted for.",8ef9e70b-2b68-4de6-b599-88956b156f6d
20,discussion1," In the fully adjusted model, once all covariates and other food groups were taken into account, only moderate fish consumption and low fruit consumption were associated with dementia risk.  Fish shows the strongest association in the single models as well as the whole model when food groups are mutually adjusted for. Our measure of fish consumption included both oily (sardines, salmon, anchovies, mackerel, herring) and non-oily fish (cod, tinned tuna, haddock), irrespective of type (canned, fresh, frozen) and cooking method (fried, boiled, roasted). Our findings support the general consensus on fish consumption and brain health benefits. Fish is one of the food groups most consistently associated with lower cognitive decline [19] and decreased risk of dementia [20].",e2f0beee-68dd-4ed9-842f-16470d2c5651
21,discussion2," Cohort studies conducted in France, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Italy and the USA all show associations between regular fish consumption and decreased risk of incident dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease and cognitive decline [14], but mechanisms underlying this effect have not been elucidated.  We found low consumption of fruit to be associated with decreased dementia risk. Most cohort studies have examined the association between fruits in combination with vegetable consumption, and generally results show decreased risk of dementia [14]. Those who have examined fruit consumption on its own have generally failed to find any significant associations with dementia or cognitive decline [13, 14]. It is possible that previous studies have failed to detect any significant associations due to inadequate adjustment in their models or lack of statistical power. We could not examine potential reasons for this finding.",1af4051e-b68d-476a-8753-62032ac89dc2
22,discussion3," It may be that those consuming lower levels of fruit are snacking less and eating diets that are generally healthier. Lower consumption of fruit may provide some benefits in terms of fibre intake but without additional sugar and calories from higher fruit consumption. It may also be that this is a spurious result, and replication in other cohorts would be needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.  Our results on meat consumption do not replicate previous findings from cohort studies [21]. We did not find any significant associations between processed meat consumption and increased dementia risk, although a trend was present which may relate to the stricter selection of covariates and the adjustment for other dietary components in our study.  In the context of the Mediterranean diet, it is possible for fish consumption to drive the beneficial effects.",414a263e-4b2b-480b-a962-187ad232a313
23,discussion4," Alternatively, it is possible for the diet to influence dementia risk through secondary pathways such as cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes.  There are a number of strengths of our study. We had detailed information available on food components and robust adjustment for a wide range of covariates including sociodemographic, lifestyle, mental health and physical health factors. We included both a measure of socioeconomic deprivation and a measure of income as consumption of certain foods is likely to be associated with personal wealth. Additionally, deprivation scores relate to the area a person lives in and are not necessarily a reflection of the individual’s level of deprivation. We had a large sample size and reasonably long follow-up. Additionally, we excluded people who had dementia at baseline or within 3 years of the baseline assessment to exclude the possibility of reverse causality as much as possible.",9f9f62b4-5bd7-4571-bfba-a31e1820192a
24,discussion5," Limitations were that food consumption was only measured once in all individuals so we could not see how changes in diet may have affected dementia risk. Additionally, diet as well as many covariates were based on self-report which may be prone to bias. The UK Biobank sample is recruited from healthy volunteers so we cannot be sure the associations are generalisable.  Although we have adjusted for many covariates, we cannot rule out the possibility that the association is spurious and cannot be sure the effect is causal. This work can be further expanded to examine the influence of altered caloric intake or meal timing together with the effects of healthy diets such as the Mediterranean on brain health. This study has not collected information on calorie restriction. Emerging work in animal models has shown that prolonged reduction in daily caloric intake and periodic fasting cycles may lead to a delay of the onset and progression of disease [22].",821916b0-3fc4-4ca1-8f4e-767c26527c87
25,discussion6," In humans, intermittent fasting has been shown to improve cognitive dysfunction and inhibit hippocampal neuronal damage against oxidative stress [23]. Thus, future cohort studies should consider the integration of a balanced nutritious diet with periods of fasting or controlled calorie intake to further examine its effects on brain health.  Overall, our study provides evidence that consumption of fish is associated with lower risk of dementia but that other components of the Mediterranean diet are not associated with dementia risk when other covariates and other dietary components are taken into account. We cannot draw conclusions about the reasons behind this association, and this deserves further study.
