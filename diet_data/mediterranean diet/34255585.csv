0,methods0," 2.1. Participants  The sample consisted of 362 university students from different degrees and institutions. The age range was between 18 and 36 years (M = 22.36 years, SD = 3.76). Concerning the anthropometric data of the sample, the weight range was between 37 and 98 kg (Mweight = 61.28 kg, SD = 10.46), the height range was between 150 and 190 cm (Mheight = 166.32 cm, SD = 7.17), and consequently the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) range was between 14.45 and 33.33 (Mbody mass index (BMI) = 22.11, SD = 3.23). The sociodemographic data of the sample are shown in Table 1.  2.2. Instruments  The questionnaire consisted of five scales. Each of them is described below:  Sociodemographic and anthropometric data: descriptive characteristics of the sample were collected. The variables included were age, sex, university, degree, year of study, usual residence (family, friends, partner, flatmate, student residence, or other), and work activity (yes/no, part-time/full-time).",4b620709-5eb8-4401-8570-591d30069597
1,methods1," Anthropometric data such as weight (kg) and height (cm) were self-reported, and considering both scores, the body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Based on the World Health Organization classification, participants were grouped according to their body mass index (BMI) score as follows: underweight (<18.5 kg/m2, n = 36), normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2, n = 268), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2, n = 48) and obesity (>30 kg/m2, n = 10).  Self-perceived food literacy (Self perceived food literacy (SPFL)) scale: a translation of the Dutch scale designed and validated to measure food literacy [29] in adult populations was carried out. The scale is composed of a total of 29 items grouped into eight dimensions (food preparation skills, resilience, and willpower, type of healthy snacks, social and mindful consumption, observing nutrition labels, daily planning, health budget, and healthy food storage). The response scale is Likert-type and ranges from 1 = never, to 5 = always.",454312c4-911d-4c07-8144-d14e0da76dd8
2,methods2," The scoring of the reverse items was corrected so that a higher score implied higher food literacy.  Mediterranean diet adherence screener (Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS)): a questionnaire on adherence to the Mediterranean diet validated in Spanish [37] was administered. It is composed of 14 items, 12 of which are related to the consumption of foods belonging to the Mediterranean diet (e.g., olive oil, vegetables, fruits, wine) and two of which refer to cooking and eating preferences (fats used and type of meat). The items are written in a dichotomous way (yes/no). Each item is scored with 0 or 1 point. Scores below nine are considered to indicate low adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern.  Impulsivity (negative urgency, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, sensation seeking, and positive urgency; UPPS-P): the short version of the UPPS-P [38] measuring impulsivity was administered. It was validated in a Spanish university population [26].",91e44008-5e4b-45c7-b181-8c1fe1b8e91e
3,methods3," The UPPS-P (short version) consists of 20 items grouped into five factors (positive urgency, negative urgency, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, and sensation seeking). The items are presented with a Likert-type scale with four response options ranging from 1 = strongly agree, to 4 = strongly disagree.  Health questionnaire (SF12 version 2): this instrument is the result of the Spanish adaptation by Alonso et al. [39] of the SF12 health questionnaire [40,41,42]. It is composed of 12 items from eight dimensions of the SF36 health questionnaire (physical function, social function, physical role, emotional role, mental health, road, bodily pain, and general health). The response options are dichotomous for four items, and the rest are presented with a three- or five-point Likert-type scale. The final score was calculated with a summatory where higher scores were indicative of better physical and mental health status.  2.3.",1e0f0a45-d233-4bbb-ad95-083bc205dbf2
4,methods4," Procedure  This was an instrumental, descriptive, and cross-sectional study. The project was approved by the Bioethics Committee of our institution (blinded for peer review). After translation and back-translation of the self-perceived food literacy (Self perceived food literacy (SPFL)) scale, it was grouped with four other instruments, and an online questionnaire was created. The tool was piloted on a sample of 14 university students who met the inclusion criteria. No modifications were made after this. These participants were then excluded from further data collection. The aims of the study were explained and informed consent for participation was requested at the beginning of the questionnaire throughout the fieldwork. Data collection was carried out from 10 November 2020 to 25 January 2021 via the Moodle platform and via the social network Instagram. Participants did not receive any incentives.  2.4.",873eb162-763e-488d-8bf9-275cfc227eeb
5,methods5," Design and Data Analysis  Firstly, descriptive statistics were calculated for the sample (socio-demographic and anthropometric data). Secondly, a confirmatory factor analysis (confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)) was carried out to check the structure of the questionnaire, as research indicates that this is appropriate for cases of translated scales that have been previously validated. Maximum likelihood estimation was used. As for the thresholds of the calculated estimates, levels between ≥0.95 and <0.97 for CFI, levels between ≥0.90 and ≤0.95 for GFI and TLI, and levels between ≥0.85 and ≤0.90 for AGFI indicate an acceptable model fit while levels ≤0.05 for RMSEA indicate a good fit. The lowest AIC value is considered to indicate the best model [43]. Thirdly, the internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha was calculated to determine the reliability of the scale.",e21b958f-195a-4b39-a750-228088e5708b
6,methods6," Finally, given that a non-normal distribution was confirmed for all the study variables, convergent validity was calculated through Spearman correlations between the Self perceived food literacy (SPFL) scale and the other variables (Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS), UPPS-P, and SF12 version 2). All analyses were carried out with the statistical data package SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and Amos version 25. Gpower 3.1 was used to verify that the achieved statistical power was at least 0.8 for all analyses with the actual sample size.  3. Results  To understand the factor structure of the food literacy scale adapted to Spanish, four different models were analyzed. The fit indices of the models are shown in Table 2.  First, a one-factor model (M0) represented by the 29 items proposed by the authors of the original scale was analyzed.",f0a03b36-8eb7-43e7-8b5f-d07788d63a66
7,methods7," M0 was discarded since the three items (items 17–19) corresponding to factor 4 (consideration of eating as a social and conscious act) of the original scale [29] were not statistically significant and were subsequently removed. After removing the non-significant items, a second model (M1), also unifactorial (26 items), was analyzed without satisfactory results (see Table 3).  The third model (M2) that was analyzed consisted of 25 items. It was a model of seven interrelated factors like the one presented by the authors of the original scale. In this model, factor 3 (items 13–16) was removed due to the low reliability reported by Poelman et al. [29] (Figure 1). M0 and M1 were thus discarded due to their poor fit compared to M2. Finally, a fourth model (M3) consisting of five interrelated factors was analyzed because of the low significance of items 18 and 19 after analyzing M2.",b2074786-38b6-4856-a673-961aca91a2ab
8,methods8," Due to the impossibility of a factor being represented by only one item, the remaining item was also discarded (item 17) and the factor was eliminated in this model. Although the fit between M2 and M3 was quite similar, M3 showed the best fit after carrying out further analyses. Its internal consistency was adequate (α = 0.81).  The five factors obtained from M3 were named: cooking skills (items 1–6), emotional management (items 7–12), healthy consumption as a priority (13–16, 24, and 25), nutritional literacy and planning (20–23), and availability of ultra-processed foods (26–29). Cronbach’s alpha for each factor was 0.83, 0.71, 0.84, 0.82, and 0.82, respectively. As shown in Table 3, the concurrent validity analyses conducted showed a positive and significant relationship between food literacy and adherence to the Mediterranean diet and perceived health, and a negative and significant relationship between food literacy and impulsivity.",3dfa777d-6ad7-4c56-b2e1-0002c772fb7a
9,methods9,"  To assess the differences between each body mass index (BMI) group and the factors of the Self perceived food literacy (SPFL), a repeated measures Analysis of Variance (a repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)) was carried out. The results indicated that the multivariate test was significant, traza pillai = 0.08, F(12,1071) = 2.51, p = 0.003, η2p = 0.03, observed potency = 0.976. The within-subject effects test indicated that the interaction between the factors of the Self perceived food literacy (SPFL) and the body mass index (BMI) groups was also significant, F(12,1432) = 2.35, p = 0.005, η2p = 0.02, observed potency = 0.967. A multivariate a repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) indicated that the multivariate test for the body mass index (BMI) group was also significant, traza pillai = 0.09, F(15,1068) = 2.28, p = 0.004, η2p = 0.03, observed potency = 0.983.

10,methods10,"03, observed potency = 0.809. However, DMS post hoc tests also showed differences in factor 1 between underweight (M = 3.48) and obesity (M = 4.15) groups, p = 0.026, and in factor 4 between normal weight (M = 3.26) and both underweight (M = 2.76) and overweight (M = 2.91) groups (p = 0.005 and p = 0.28, respectively). Also, a difference was found in factor 5 between underweight (M = 3.46) and normal weight (M = 3.95) groups, p = 0.006 (Figure 2).  4. Discussion  Food literacy is a recent multidimensional construct that lays the foundation for navigating the food system appropriately, according to the circumstances and resources available [21]. The aim of this study was to explore the psychometric properties of the Spanish adaptation of the food literacy scale developed by Poelman et al. [29] for its subsequent validation. The results show that it is a valid and reliable scale for measuring this construct in a university population.",63ab87a0-278b-4318-bf59-7650e3650a47
11,methods11," The scale is composed of 16 items grouped into five factors.  Previous research in other countries has explored the factor structure of food literacy [44,45]. However, although they have the same conceptual and definitional framework as a reference, the distribution and representation of the subcomponents are different between them [46]. In this study, the elimination of the factor that considers food as a social act due to its low significance could be explained because the population included university students and not adults with whom Poelman et al. [29] developed their scale. University students perceive time constraints as a barrier to implementing healthy eating behaviors [22]. If they perceive it as being difficult to dedicate time to healthy eating at the same time as, for example, attending classes [47], it is understandable that they also do not attach much importance to the social gathering around food in their daily lives.",1764487b-ffbd-452d-a906-1ec334d2c86b
12,methods12," in any case, none of these studies have made an empirical observation based on the life experience of the target population [46] but have rather relied on experts for the development of the scale or followed nutritional recommendations from the country, or based on previous research [44,48]. This underestimates the influence of geography and culture on the concept [49] and demonstrates psychometric differences between scales across countries.  The differences between M2 and M3 were mainly in the distribution of the items and the reliability indices as well as the individual factors. M3 includes subcomponents in the same factor that Poelman et al. [29] included separately.",868ad631-8499-40cc-ae0c-b5940feb9385
13,methods13," This change in the distribution and number of items and the consequent impact it had on the total and factor reliability of the scale may be due to the interrelated nature of each of the components of food literacy, even though theoretically the authors Vidgen and Gallegos [21] grouped and classified them separately [46]. This could be due to the leap between theory and practice, typical of the beginnings of measuring a new construct. Although the differences between M2 and M3 were minimal, the latter still represented seven of the subcomponents proposed by the theoretical authors and had a total scale reliability (α = 0.89), higher than that shown in previous studies [44,48].  On the other hand, external validity was demonstrated through the relationship between food literacy and other variables. As expected, those with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet indicated better food literacy, which also occurred with all the factors.",f18595a7-2bcf-478d-aaf3-15efa8a3082c
14,methods14," This is consistent with previous research that found a relationship between food literacy components (planning, food knowledge, cooking skills, etc.) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet. These components are conceived as variables that favor the frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption and therefore facilitate adherence [48]. This result offers an opportunity for educational intervention, not only for university students, but also for the people who are responsible for this task of self- and hetero-care, in cases where they are not yet living independently [45].  In terms of impulsivity, the results showed the expected correlation with the full scale and its factors: those who were more impulsive scored lower in food literacy. These results are consistent with prior research.",b1b3d5de-1b3d-4bd1-98e5-1cfe0c86e6e3
15,methods15," For example, in relation to factor 2 (emotional management), this is in line with previous studies [50], which highlighted the importance of the emotional state and its management in relation to healthy eating behaviors. The correlation between factor 2 and factor 5 (availability for ultra-processed foods) is related to studies indicating that, high consumption of ultra-processed foods is associated with increased impulsivity when eating, which in turn correlates with depressive or anxious states [51]. The negative correlation between impulsivity and factor 4 (nutritional literacy and planning) also seems coherent since food literacy is positively related to self-control [29]. This pattern of correlations is especially important in university students, as in the study conducted by Hernandez et al. [52], 51% of the sample admitted to eating less healthily during the university exam period.",98bf814d-0e4a-4916-acbc-6a1d8711d173
16,methods16," In addition, those with higher food literacy scores were found to perceive themselves as healthier. This result was found for the full scale and for the five factors. This positive relationship between food literacy, health, and well-being has also been found in other studies [25,48]. Regarding differences between body mass index (BMI) groups on Self perceived food literacy (SPFL) factors, the fact that participants with a normal weight showed better levels of nutritional literacy and planning than underweight and overweight participants may indicate that better knowledge in these aspects of nutrition is beneficial for a healthier weight. This result is in line with the study by Wijayaratne et al., where a negative association between body mass index (BMI) and food literacy was found, along with a positive effect of food literacy on preparing healthy meals [45].",3215e213-e258-4000-b4eb-95817f8d2810
17,methods17," In addition, the lower availability of ultra-processed foods in the underweight group compared to the normal weight group could be indicative of a type of dietary restraint in the former group. More research is necessary to explore these relationships.  Despite its contributions, this study has limitations. Regarding the size of the sample, although it was adequate for the development and validation of the scale, it may not be representative of the Spanish university population. Specifically, one of the limitations in relation to our sample is the low representation of men. It would be necessary, in future studies, for the sample size to be larger and to include homogeneous and gender-balanced groups from different programs of study and regions. On the other hand, the existing psychometric limitations are the result of the novelty of the concept.",a630ad2a-e38a-4dc0-a0fc-546550e48869
18,methods18," It would be interesting to develop a scale in Spanish that includes the 11 subcomponents of food literacy instead of looking for an adjustment to the four major domains (planning, selection, preparation, and consumption) where, according to Amouzandeh et al. [46], some bias could lie. A longitudinal study could also be conducted, including objective concept measures in addition to self-reported ones.  5. Conclusions  To our knowledge, this study presents the first food literacy measurement tool that has been validated in Spanish in a university population. Although it is still a wide field to be explored, it is now possible to understand the relationship between food literacy and adherence to a healthy and sustainable eating pattern (Mediterranean diet) and how this is related to intrapersonal variables such as impulsivity. But, above all, the results allow us to establish the relationship that these competencies have on the perceived health of university students.",943b4953-5fa1-436b-9604-9e0469ea244f
19,methods19," Therefore, it would be advisable to encourage the development of food literacy to increase adherence to healthy eating patterns and to promote the physical and psychological health that derive from it. The Spanish university system could and should be one of the central channels for the acquisition and maintenance of the primary base knowledge that guarantees well-being regarding food intake.
