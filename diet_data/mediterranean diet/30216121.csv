0,background0,"Due to unhealthy diet and lifestyles in the context of ageing populations, the global epidemic of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) has reached unexpected dimensions. In order to stop this pandemic, it is of utmost importance to find robust biomarkers for both early detection and risk prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1] and T2D [2].  Previous studies have shown that circulating 2-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA) levels were associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome [3, 4] and had the ability to predict the risk of future T2D [5]. The metabolite 2-AAA results from the degradation pathway of lysine (Additional file 1: Fig. S1), an essential amino acid. However, lysine has not been consistently associated with metabolic syndrome or T2D in previous studies [3]. In the pathway of lysine degradation (Additional file 1: Fig.",bbacd45b-f019-4944-ad07-62327e9faa43
1,background1," S1) there is also another metabolite, pipecolic acid, that may be implicated in other diseases such as human diabetic corneal stroma [6]. Thus, it seemed important to further explore lysine degradation pathway in relation to T2D to find potential biomarkers and/or underlying biological mechanisms.  On the other hand, T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD) share many common etiologic factors, and as explained above, 2-AAA has been postulated as a predictor factor for T2D [5]. Thus, it seems important to study the potential role of 2-AAA in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the same context, lysine and 2-AAA have also been implicated in the development of other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome [3].",1e1bf8cd-3163-4ad9-83cd-4c8c61fd9049
2,background2," Consequently, the role of metabolites involved in lysine degradation (trough 2-AAA) pathway should also be explored in association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and whether the presence of T2D may modify this association should be studied.  One study suggested that 2-AAA may be modified by diet because a study reported significantly higher levels of 2-AAA after a beef meal compared to a baked herring meal [7], proposing a potential dietary effect on the regulation of the pathway.  In the frame of the PREDIMED study, a large nutritional intervention trial with Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), we assessed the following hypotheses: (a) baseline (or 1-year changes) in plasma levels of lysine, 2-AAA or pipecolic acid are associated with higher incidence of T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD); (b) the intervention with MedDiet induced changes in lysine,",fd510f27-0e71-4272-9392-ec192d70fa20

4,methods0,"To analyze the association of lysine, 2-AAA or pipecolic acid with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or T2D, we used two sets of case-cohort studies (Figs. 1, 2) nested within the PREDIMED trial (Trial registration: ISRCTN35739639; registration date: 05/10/2005; recruitment start date 01/10/2003; http://www.predimed.es). PREDIMED was a primary cardiovascular prevention trial testing Mediterranean diets, as described elsewhere [8, 9]. Briefly, 7447 participants (men aged 55–80 years and women aged 60–80 years), initially free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but at high cardiovascular risk, were allocated to 3 dietary interventions: (1) a MedDiet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil (MedDiet + EVOO); (2) a MedDiet supplemented with mixed nuts (MedDiet + nuts); or (3) a control diet (low-fat diet).Fig. 1 Flow-chart of the case-cohort design for cardiovascular disease (CVD). cardiovascular disease (CVD) cardiovascular disease   Fig. 2 Flow-chart of the case-cohort design for T2D.",55d04c71-ce61-4000-bf46-6765c88426f2
5,methods1," T2D type 2 diabetes    In the first nested case-cohort study (Fig. 1), cases were all primary cardiovascular disease (CVD) events with available blood samples and the subcohort was a random sample of all the trial. We included a random sample of ~ 10% of PREDIMED participants at baseline (the subcohort) and 233 incident cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with available blood samples which occurred during a median follow-up of 4.8 years (55 of the 288 incident cases of the PREDIMED trial had no available plasma samples). We also excluded 73 participants (63 non-cases and 10 cases) because of unavailable 2-AAA or lysine metabolites data (Fig. 1). Finally, 917 participants were included in our analysis: 221 incident cases and 730 participants in the subcohort (including 34 overlapping cases).",2017c1c9-50b3-4443-9471-9369f4111ffe
6,methods2," In addition, 809 participants (687 participants in the subcohort and 147 cases, including 25 overlapping cases) had available plasma samples after 1-year of follow-up and were included in the analyses of metabolite changes at 1 year (Fig. 1).  In the design of the second case-cohort study (Fig. 2) we considered that 3541 participants did not have T2D at baseline in the full PREDIMED cohort and we only considered them for the second case-cohort design, as they were candidates to develop new-onset T2D. Among them, there were 273 incident cases of T2D observed during follow-up. The present study comprised a random selection of 694 participants (approximately 20%) from the roster of all eligible subjects of the PREDIMED (subcohort), together with all incident cases of T2D with available plasma sample that occurred during a median follow-up of 3.8 years of intervention (cases).",40025e6c-4a81-4a79-b659-01cc877d27f6
7,methods3," Baseline measurements for the metabolites were available for 610 non-cases and 243 incident cases (51 of the cases were overlapped with the subcohort). On the other hand, 669 participants, 516 non-cases and 153 (35 of them overlapped with the subcohort) cases that occurred after 1 year of follow-up, had available 1-year follow-up samples. Among them, 609 subjects had 1-year lysine, 2-AAA and pipecolic acid measurements and were finally included in the 1-year change analyses (Fig. 2).  The Research Ethics Committees for each of the recruitment centres approved the study protocol and all participants provided written informed consent.  Ascertainment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and T2D cases The primary endpoint of the PREDIMED trial was a composite outcome of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and cardiovascular death.",5264929e-e02e-43b4-af2c-e7c7ff2565de
8,methods4," Physicians, blinded with respect to the intervention, reviewed yearly, in each recruitment center, all the participants’ medical charts to assess any incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcome. Other sources of information (also blinded with respect to the intervention), such as consultation of the National Death Index, were used to ascertain incident cases. Then, anonymized information was sent from each recruitment center to a blinded central Event Ascertainment Committee who finally adjudicated the events.  The PREDIMED protocol included T2D as a pre-specified secondary endpoint of the trial among participants initially free of diabetes. At baseline, prevalent T2D was identified by clinical diagnosis and/or use of antidiabetic medication. The diagnosis of incident T2D during follow-up has been described elsewhere [9, 10] and followed the American Diabetes Association criteria [11].",6b3ba8c8-5d16-4726-af8d-7631cab825e5
9,methods5," Blinded study physicians collected information on the outcomes in the yearly ad hoc reviews of the participants’ medical charts. Also, information on incident cases of T2D was collected from continuous contact with participants and primary health care physicians, and annual follow-up visits. Blinded to the intervention assignment, the Clinical End-Point Committee adjudicated the events according to standard criteria.  Covariate assessment At baseline and at yearly follow-up visits, participants completed a questionnaire collecting lifestyle information, educational achievement, history of illnesses, medication use, and family history of disease. Physical activity was assessed using the validated Spanish version of the Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity questionnaire [12].

10,methods6," After centrifugation, plasma EDTA was collected, and aliquots were coded and kept refrigerated until they were stored at − 80 °C. Pairs of samples (baseline and first-year visits from each participant) were randomly ordered and shipped on dry ice to the Broad Institute for the metabolomics analyses.  Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS) was used to measure polar plasma metabolites. Negative ion mode, targeted MS analyses of 2-AAA were conducted as described previously [5]. Briefly, LC–MS samples were prepared from plasma (30 µL) via protein precipitation with the addition of four volumes of 80% methanol containing inosine-15N4, thymine-d4 and glycocholate-d4 internal standards (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories; Andover, MA). The samples were centrifuged (10 min, 9000×g, 4 °C) and the supernatants were analyzed using an ACQUITY UPLC (Waters, Milford MA) coupled to a 5500 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA).",4647bf1e-70af-43b8-a009-ce3d759eb00b

MS data were acquired using multiple reaction monitoring scans tuned using authentic reference standards. The ion spray voltage was − 4.5 kV and the source temperature was 500 °C. Raw data were processed using MultiQuant 2.1 software (SCIEX, Framingham MA). High resolution, positive ion mode analyses of lysine and pipecolic acid were conducted using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)) LC–MS method as described previously [13].",b1fc852d-08e5-426e-8328-7cb57bbced02

Raw data were processed using Progenesis QI software (NonLinear Dynamics) for feature alignment, nontargeted signal detection, and signal integration. Compound identities were confirmed using reference standards and reference samples. Internal standard peak areas were monitored for quality control and to ensure system performance throughout analyses. Pooled plasma reference samples were analyzed at intervals of approximately 20 samples as an additional quality control and to determine analytical reproducibility [14].

15,analysis0,"The analyses in both case-cohort studies were run in parallel and following the same scheme, so we will describe the common methods. Only small differences concerning adjustments for multivariable models were introduced and will be summarized below.  Baseline analyses Baseline lysine, 2-AAA and pipecolic acid values were normalized and scaled in multiples of 1 SD with Blom’s inverse normal transformation [15]. We fitted weighted Cox regression models using Barlow weights to account for the over-representation of cases, as recommended for case-cohort designs [16]. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for cardiovascular disease (CVD) or T2D by quartiles of baseline lysine, 2-AAA or pipecolic acid. Quartile cut-off points were generated based on the distributions of each metabolite among subcohort.",d24eb32b-e22d-4bc5-8631-8d7028639b6b
16,analysis1," We conducted tests of linear trend by examining an ordinal score based on the median value in each quartile of lysine, 2-AAA or pipecolic acid in the multivariable models. Follow-up time was calculated from the date of enrollment to the date of diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (CVD)/T2D for cases, and to the date of the last visit or the end of the follow-up period for non-cases (December 1, 2010). Progressively further adjusted models were designed: first, a model adjusted for age, sex and intervention group was run; secondly, we included a multivariable adjustment including as covariates BMI (kg/m2), smoking (never/current/former), leisure-time physical activity (metabolic equivalent task [MET]s-min/day), educational level (primary vs secondary or higher), hypertension and dyslipidemia for the association with T2D, and, also including baseline T2D and family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for the association with cardiovascular disease (CVD).",468bb936-3a63-48ec-8b75-d7a077531699
17,analysis2," An additional model was designed for the association with T2D including also the adjustment for plasma baseline glucose (both continuous and quadratic term included in the model).  In order to assess the potential relationship of this pathway and other factors underlying the development of T2D, the correlations (Pearson) between 2-AAA and baseline glucose, insulin, LDL-c and HDL-c were analyzed.  As an additional analysis, we wanted to observe the potential modifying role of prevalent T2D on the associations between baseline lysine, 2-AAA or pipecolic acid with cardiovascular disease (CVD). A new variable combining the baseline diabetic status and the levels of each metabolite (below/above the median) was introduced into the models. Moreover, two independent models for diabetics and for non-diabetics were fitted.",1c6bf778-b12c-40e9-b3a6-d0ac7d18fd96
18,analysis3,"  To assess if the intervention with MedDiet was an effect modifier of the associations between baseline values of the metabolites and the risk of T2D or cardiovascular disease (CVD), fully adjusted models for the case-cohorts of both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and T2D were fitted and multiplicative independent product-terms were used to assess the potential interactions. Potential multiplicative interactions between the intervention group (MedDiet + EVOO, MedDiet + nuts or control) and the dichotomous variable for lysine, 2-AAA and pipecolic acid (defined by the values below/above its respective median) were tested with the likelihood ratio test.",a5fed7c6-b388-4691-bb70-1992f50eeb96
19,analysis4," Moreover, three new independent variables combining the intervention groups (MedDiet + EVOO, MedDiet + nuts, or control) and the dichotomous variable defined for each metabolite by its median (below or above) were created and introduced separately in fully adjusted models to analyze the effects of each metabolite stratified by intervention group. The reference category was the group of subjects allocated to the control group of the trial and the group of participants below the median of each metabolite. Additionally, adjustment for propensity scores that used 30 baseline variables to estimate the probability of assignment to each of the intervention groups and robust variance estimators were used to take into account that a small percentage of participants were non-individually randomized to the intervention groups and minor imbalances in baseline covariates existed in the trial [9].",d27dbad0-f1cc-4bac-a703-070c08588ba7

We used the same Cox regression models that for baseline analyses but including as independent variable 1-year changes for each metabolite and adjusting for their respective baseline values.  We also assessed the combined effects of intervention and 1-year changes for the three metabolites and tested the interactions between intervention groups and 1-year changes.

In the baseline comparison of characteristics between incident T2D cases and non-cases, we found that baseline glucose levels among future diabetes cases pointed to a pre-diabetic baseline stage. In fact, according to the American Diabetes Association criteria for prediabetes [17] considering only fasting glucose, the 47% of the subjects included in the subcohort appeared to present baseline prediabetes whereas the 86% of T2D incident cases presented prediabetes at baseline. On the other hand, subsequent incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) cases (as compared to non-cases) were at baseline older and more likely to be diabetic, sedentary and smokers.Table 1 Baseline characteristics of the participants according to the case-cohort design for T2D  	Subcohort (n = 661)a	T2D cases (n = 243)	 Age (years)	66.5 (5.7)	66.4 (5.",0a2fb093-03c2-40dd-9e74-96e21cee659b

To deepen into the role of the pathway in the development of T2D, we analyzed the potential correlations between baseline 2-AAA and glucose, insulin, HDL-c and LDL-c for the T2D case-cohort. These correlations, though statistically significant, were not particularly high.

A significant interaction between lysine levels (below or above the median) and T2D at baseline (p = 0.032; Additional file 1: Fig. S2) was observed.  As a next step, we assessed if the dietary intervention with MedDiet was able to modify the effects of baseline levels of lysine, 2-AAA and pipecolic acid on T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

A recent small cross sectional study reported that 2-AAA was also associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome in addition to T2D [3]. Consistent with our results, they also reported that lysine presented similar but weaker associations with these metabolic conditions. A mechanism potentially explaining these associations may be that 2-AAA is elevated in response to high glucose levels, leading to increased insulin secretion and promoting mechanisms involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis in early stages of insulin resistance [5]. In the case of lysine, it may be elevated at an early stage of this pathophysiological process to provide the 2-AAA substrate for a likely compensatory mechanism [3].",01e5889b-ad93-4d43-88e1-18978f50693e
33,discussion3," In concordance with these explanations, lysine was also found to be a predictor of insulin resistance and gestational diabetes during pregnancy in a previous study [18]. Moreover, both 2-AAA and pipecolic have been found to be elevated in diabetic corneas suggesting that this pathway may be also related to diabetes-induced diseases [6].  On the other hand, we observed no association between baseline lysine, 2-AAA or pipecolic acid levels and subsequent incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in non-diabetic subjects. However, the association of lysine with cardiovascular disease (CVD) was present in subjects with an initial diabetic status. Therefore, it is likely that this association may only be apparent among subjects with preexistent T2D. In this context, diabetic status may behave as an effect modifier of the association between lysine and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The p value for the interaction test was statistically significant, supporting this interpretation.",09a571b5-60e5-44a8-8e98-d9a99f06d690
34,discussion4," This finding represents a novelty and deserves future replication in further independent cohorts. It can be speculated that this effect modification by pre-existent diabetes may suggest that lysine can be implicated in the development of complications associated with T2D, because high levels of lysine may represent a biomarker of a poorer control of glycemic levels in T2D. This interpretation should be taken with caution and further confirmation is needed.  In addition to the 2-AAA pathway of lysine degradation, L-homoarginine may be also synthesized from lysine catabolism and, this alternative pathway, involving arginine and nitric oxide synthesis [19, 20], may be related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and T2D, as we have previously reported [21, 22].  Regarding the effect of the dietary intervention, we observed no effect of MedDiet on lysine, 2-AAA or pipecolic acid 1-year changes.",c7184505-4364-49d8-9451-95b7ccbe38d2
35,discussion5," Additionally, we did not find any significant multiplicative interaction between the MedDiet intervention and 1 year changes in lysine, 2-AAA or pipecolic acid. However, we found that MedDiet may be modifying the effects of baseline lysine on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk as we found a significant interaction between lysine and the intervention. In the same direction, results on 2-AAA and pipecolic acid pointed at the same effect of MedDiet + EVOO (non significant interaction). These results may be suggesting that although there is no a direct effect of diet on the levels of the metabolites, it is possible that MedDiet may be modifying the effects of metabolites on cardiovascular disease (CVD) or T2D risk by affecting other mechanisms that may involve different metabolic pathways, inflammation or oxidation.",0d01abc8-7bf3-4efd-827c-dd36521f06b3
36,discussion6," Further studies are needed to clarify the effect of diet on lysine, 2-AAA and pipecolic acid levels and the potential effect modification by dietary interventions on the cardiovascular disease (CVD)/T2D risk associated with these metabolites.  Our study presents some limitations. First, we do not have available data on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which was previously reported to be a biomarker of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) damage, independently of fasting glucose [23]. Thus, new studies are needed to evaluate if lysine pathway metabolites may add value to the prediction of risk provided by HbA1c. Moreover, we did not find an effect of MedDiet on 1 year-changes in none of the studied metabolites. It may be possible that 1 year is not enough time to observe sound changes in metabolites, and as a consequence we did neither observe an association between 1-year changes of metabolites and the subsequent risk of T2D or cardiovascular disease (CVD).",54da8c7f-dfeb-4e9c-a226-a98800d08fd6
37,discussion7," Another limitation is that our results may be not generalizable because we used a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding regarding the observational associations between metabolites and cardiometabolic outcomes.  Consequently, these results, especially those suggesting a potential interaction between the nutritional intervention and these 2 metabolites deserve further confirmation in independent prospective cohort studies and trials [24]. However, our study presents important strengths: we used the case‐cohort design, which retains randomization, to both evaluate associations of 2-AAA and lysine with incident T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD).",1548b0c8-c7f9-47a0-9555-e274546612f5
38,discussion8," Our analyses were adjusted for multiple confounders within a well-characterized trial and, as an important novelty, we used repeated measurements of these metabolites, that allowed us to assess 2-AAA and lysine changes due to the dietary intervention.  Conclusions In conclusion, our results provide an interesting independent replication of the association of 2-AAA with future risk of T2D, a similar association for lysine and pipecolic acid and a suggestion of a diabetes-dependent association of lysine with subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
