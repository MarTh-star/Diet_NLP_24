0,results0," Study Population and Dietary Assessment  Assessment of Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) revealed that only 20 individuals included in the study (4.5%) had a score lower than 13 points (the arithmetic means of the 0–26 Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) range), while half of the study participants had an Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score ranging between 15 and 18 points (Table 1). The scores of the 13 main food categories used to calculate the Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score are reported in Supplementary Table 1. Compliance with the guidelines set out in the MD pyramid was higher for the consumption of vegetables, milk and dairy products, wheat, and fruit (Supplementary Table 2). Instead, the lowest compliance was observed relative to the consumption of nuts and sweets. Another poorly followed MD recommendation concerned the consumption of processed and red meat. The minimum score (zero) for the consumption of these foods was obtained by 176 participants (39.",bee23167-a5bb-4b8f-b1d2-4f39c3603333

Correlation analysis between Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score, potential renal load acid (PRAL), and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) as well as energy, micronutrient, and macronutrient intake is depicted in Table 2. Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) correlated negatively with potential renal load acid (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP). There was no association between the total energy intake and Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA). Instead, greater adherence to MD was positively associated with the intake of total dietary fiber; oligosaccharides; microelements such as calcium, potassium, phosphorous, iron, and zinc; and vitamins such as riboflavin, thiamine, vitamin C, and vitamin E.",5e3ae8c6-dfe6-4a91-bd77-46769fd24c23
2,results5," These dietary acid load (DAL)-related parameters showed a positive association with the intake of total calories, protein, starch, lipid (total cholesterol and saturated lipid), sodium, and phosphorous. On the contrary, an increase in dietary acid load (DAL) was associated with a decrease in the intake of oligosaccharides, total dietary fiber, potassium, and some vitamins (folic acid, thiamine, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin A, and vitamin E). Despite both potential renal load acid (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) being related to dietary acid load (DAL), there were differences between these dietary acid load (DAL) proxies. Only potential renal load acid (PRAL) was positively correlated with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, niacin, and vitamin D intake, while only net endogenous acid production (NEAP) was negatively correlated with tiamin (Table 2).",c9ea6d03-d1b2-49f2-a342-627c5f586891
3,results6,"  Anthropometrics, Body Composition, and Metabolic Parameters  To investigate the effects of dietary habits on selected health outcomes, potential renal load acid (PRAL) was divided into quartiles to associate this parameter with an alkaline, neutral, slightly acidic, or strongly acidic diet (alkaline potential renal load acid (PRAL), neutral potential renal load acid (PRAL), light potential renal load acid (PRAL), and strong potential renal load acid (PRAL), respectively). Similar to potential renal load acid (PRAL), net endogenous acid production (NEAP) was divided into quartiles. Instead, the Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score range of the study participants was too tight to separate them into quartiles; therefore, they were divided into tertiles as follows: low Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA), medium Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA), and high Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA).",7ca0cc1b-4914-4c78-a0d3-e8e28f3f0a04
4,results7,"  Participants in the low-Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) tertile, relative to individuals in the high-Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) tertiles, had a higher body mass index (BMI) and fat mass; a worse metabolic profile marked by higher triglyceride concentrations, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher HOMA-IR values. Furthermore, study participants in the low-Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) tertile had a higher dietary acid load (DAL), as assessed by net endogenous acid production (NEAP), compared to participants in the high-Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) tertile (Table 3). Despite the rest of the parameters analyzed did not reach statistical significance between Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) tertiles, the differences in waist circumference, triglycerides, and potential renal load acid (PRAL) tended to be significant when comparing individuals in the low- and high-Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) tertiles (p = 0.052, p = 0.069, and p = 0.056, respectively).",f490d166-e16f-4e48-8248-e3382aaf1f98

11,discussion0," This study aimed at shedding light on the relationship between MetS, estimated CV risk, and dietary habits, with a particular focus on Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) and dietary acid load (DAL).  The results reported in this study indicate that the Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score negatively correlates with dietary acid load (DAL). Nonetheless, despite Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) being associated with an improvement in some metabolic health parameters, a higher Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score was not concomitant with a lower prevalence of MetS or a decrease in CV risk, an effect which was observed in the study participants consuming diets with a low dietary acid load (DAL). The statistical analyses have generally shown similar results for potential renal load acid (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP), but with a higher statistical power for potential renal load acid (PRAL).",1c3cd221-8eee-4f2b-95af-4c2fd6da70f6
12,discussion1,"  At present, to our knowledge, no study has analyzed the relationship between Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score, dietary acid load (DAL), and cardiometabolic health, especially to test the possibility that some of the metabolic benefits of the MD may be dependent on its low dietary acid load (DAL). However, Bullò and coworkers (31) partially addressed this matter by investigating the effects of a 1-year intervention with an MD supplemented with olive oil or nuts on bone health. The authors reported a decrease in potential renal load acid (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) values in the participants eating an MD supplemented with olive oil and an increase in those consuming an MD integrated with nuts (31).",fd0992bf-334d-4b63-a3c7-6fa560624522
13,discussion2," This is in line with the findings of this study, in which a higher Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score was associated with lower potential renal load acid (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) and the fact that the study participants reported high olive oil and low nut consumption.  The health-promoting effects ascribed to the MD appear to be mediated, at least in part, by the high intake of antioxidants derived from fruits, olive oil, and vegetables, as well as the intake of oleic acid, dietary fiber, non-refined carbohydrates, and plant proteins (32). These key nutritional features are reflected in this study, as indicated by a positive association between Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score and the intake of vitamins with antioxidant activity (vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E), dietary fiber, and potassium. Instead, these nutrients negatively correlated with potential renal load acid (PRAL).",6b5ef677-7130-4ceb-8b6c-65670375f428
14,discussion3," Furthermore, while no association was observed relative to the Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score, net endogenous acid production (NEAP) and potential renal load acid (PRAL) were positively correlated with saturated fatty acids and cholesterol intake. In light of this, while antioxidants and dietary fibers may contribute to the cardiometabolic protection exerted by the MD (33, 34), saturated fatty acids and cholesterol represent key elements in the development of cardiometabolic diseases (35). However, the Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score did not correlate with saturated (negatively) and monounsaturated (positively) fatty acids. This may be explained by the fact that none of the study participants completely adhered to the MD, as witnessed by Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) scores ranging between 18.0 and 22.3 out of 26.",6e675e88-967e-406c-afc2-afc8fb86dc48
15,discussion4,"  As already described by the EPIC-PANACEA project (36), the results presented in this study confirm the positive impact of the MD on body weight regulation. Study participants with a high-Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score had a lower body mass index (BMI) and fat mass compared to participants in the low-Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) tertile. Instead, there were no differences in body mass index (BMI) and fat mass between participants stratified by potential renal load acid (PRAL) values, although there were significant differences in waist circumference, free fat mass, total body water, muscle mass, and body cell mass between these groups. Findings described in the literature about the associations between dietary acid load (DAL) and body mass index (BMI) are controversial. An umbrella review by Farhangi et al. (37) reported either a positive, negative or no association between dietary acid load (DAL) and body mass index (BMI).",e4bd1c40-1857-45d3-8b66-d5a641d3e177
16,discussion5," After analyzing all the data, they concluded that significant differences were observed only when participants were stratified by sex; higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with higher potential renal load acid (PRAL) in women and with higher net endogenous acid production (NEAP) in men (37). Nevertheless, body mass index (BMI) is not a sufficient predictor of cardiometabolic outcomes as it does not take into consideration body composition nor fat distribution. In fact, differences in body mass index (BMI) may also reflect variations in fat-free mass and muscle mass, which increase in parallel with dietary acid load (DAL) and may be dependent on the higher protein intake. On the contrary, waist circumference represents a more accurate predictor of cardiometabolic health compared to body mass index (BMI) alone (38).",3fe5a13f-8b4a-441b-8956-e1a7357069b0
17,discussion6," Not surprisingly, in fact, study participants in the highest potential renal load acid (PRAL) quartile had higher waist circumference measures, which supports the potential association between a higher dietary acid load (DAL) and cardiometabolic diseases.  In agreement with a previous meta-analysis (39), the results reported in this study revealed a better metabolic profile in participants with a higher Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score. This was underlined by a lower HOMA-IR, suggesting an increase in insulin sensitivity and an improvement in the circulating levels of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, albeit the latter did not reach statistical significance. Despite this, a higher Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score was not associated with a reduction in the criteria for the diagnosis of MetS or MetS prevalence.",8498d5e6-4b5d-4f38-bf08-9131ff335bbe
18,discussion7," On the contrary, the percentage of study participants with positive MetS diagnostic criteria, namely, circulating glucose, triglycerides levels, and blood pressure were higher in the strong potential renal load acid (PRAL) group vs. the alkaline potential renal load acid (PRAL) group, supporting the possibility that a higher dietary acid load (DAL) may impair metabolic health (16). Similar results were obtained by analyzing net endogenous acid production (NEAP) quartiles and MetS prevalence. These results are in agreement with previous reports indicating similar associations between potential renal load acid (PRAL) as well as net endogenous acid production (NEAP) and the prevalence of MetS in Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes (40) and a cross-sectional Japanese study, in which higher net endogenous acid production (NEAP) values (potential renal load acid (PRAL) was not calculated) were associated with an increased prevalence of MetS independently of sex, age,",8c7faea7-710e-4f4e-acf4-4dae413f76d2
19,discussion8," and body mass index (BMI) (17). Contradictory results were described by Jafari et al. (41) who observed an association between MetS prevalence and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) but not potential renal load acid (PRAL) in a cohort of Iranian men. Instead, the other two Iranian studies reported no association between potential renal load acid (PRAL) or net endogenous acid production (NEAP) and the MetS (42, 43). Diverging results may be due to differences in dietary quality and/or genetic, sociodemographic, and behavioral characteristics of the population. Furthermore, the lack of association between Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) and decrease in MetS prevalence may be dependent on the fact that the diet of the study cohort, including for the individuals with a higher Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score, was not always strictly in line with the MD pyramid, as already described.",ded67e7c-8714-4b10-a23d-74cc2be0e570
20,discussion9,"  In this study, higher potential renal load acid (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) values were associated with a heightened CV risk regardless of the risk score used. Similar results were reported in the only study conducted to date (44). Regarding the Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score, instead, no association with CV risk was observed. However, this is surprising, especially considering this dietary pattern being widely demonstrated to exert protective effects against major CV events (7). The reason for this discrepancy may be dependent on the fact that this study was not a strict dietary intervention, but it is based on food frequency questionnaires and by the fact that the recommendations set by the MD pyramid were not always followed by a large portion of the study population, as in the case of red meat consumption.",88487b27-c5bf-4667-9fca-2eda13d29864
21,discussion10," Furthermore, while a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts has previously been shown to increase dietary acid load (DAL) compared to an MD supplemented with olive oil (31), it still exerted a protective effect against CV events (7). This suggests that despite dietary acid load (DAL) being associated with CV risk, alone it is not sufficient to explain CV risk. Instead, CV risk is more likely to depend upon overall diet quality. In fact, in this study, a higher dietary acid load (DAL) was positively associated with the intake of total lipids, saturated fatty acids, cholesterol, and sodium, with all these nutrients being linked with an increase in CV risk (45). Thus, in this study, a low dietary acid load (DAL) may represent an indicator of healthier dietary choices linked with better cardiometabolic health. This is in agreement with the metabolically detrimental effects of the Western diet, which, in fact, is a highly acidogenic dietary pattern (16, 46).",56123380-a943-4207-a2c3-251c1ee4fb59
22,discussion11,"  The results described here allow various reflections. First, it is possible to state that adherence to the MD, measured as the frequency of food consumption without considering the number of nutrients ingested, does not reflect MetS prevalence nor CV risk. An increase in the predictive power could be given by considering not only the diet but also other parameters associated with the Mediterranean lifestyle, such as culinary, social, and physical activity habits. An example of this is the mediterranean lifestyle (MEDLIFE) index, developed by Sotos-Prieto et al. (47) which includes fifteen items relative to food consumption; seven items about traditional Mediterranean dietary habits; and six items about physical activity, rest, and social interactions.  Second, especially when assessed by potential renal load acid (PRAL), dietary acid load (DAL) was associated with worse indices of metabolic and CV prognosis.",c611d6c5-27a8-434d-b6a7-bc237ae1426b
23,discussion12," Positive linear associations of potential renal load acid (PRAL) and pathological conditions are described in literature except in a studio by Xu et al. (48) in which a modest non-linear U-shaped relation between mortality rates and potential renal load acid (PRAL) was found, with a worse prognosis for both dietary acid and alkali excess. However, in this study, alkaline potential renal load acid (PRAL) values are lower than values observed in this study (minimal values of potential renal load acid (PRAL) were −111 and −41.9 mEq/day, respectively). Therefore, the present results could not exclude potential negative effects of alkali excess in the diet.  This study has several strengths. First, the Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score, potential renal load acid (PRAL), and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) were estimated based on questionnaires and algorithms administered or calculated by trained interviewers and not self-administered questionnaires as reported in other studies.",66ad9bf4-fd1f-4ae1-ae62-73553a3fb6b1
24,discussion13," Second, dietary acid load (DAL) was assessed by two tools (potential renal load acid (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP)), while the CV risk score was calculated by 3 different validated algorithms, and the results were similar. Third, participants comprised a relatively large and well-characterized population. Fourth, to the best of our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate the relationship between indices of metabolic and CV health and dietary parameters, namely Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score and dietary acid load (DAL).  This study also presents some limitations, which need to be taken into consideration. First, the lack of consensus on how to assess Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) made it difficult to compare the present results with previously published studies reporting on Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) scores.",bbe488c9-bb51-484c-9476-008b05f70501
25,discussion14," In fact, there are almost 30 scores based on different food frequency questionnaires to assess Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) (49). potential renal load acid (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) are calculated by a mathematical equation using levels of nutrients estimated with software (Winfood) using the average of the two 24-h recalls.  Conclusion  There is no doubt that the MD pattern is associated with lower CV risk, but the Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) score calculated using food frequency did not correlate with metabolic and CV state defined as the prevalence of MetS and estimated CV risk. Instead, dietary acid load (DAL) values, especially those assessed using potential renal load acid (PRAL) computed from 24-h recalls, more closely relate to a cardiometabolic health state.
