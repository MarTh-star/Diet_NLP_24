Study Design and Recruitment Eligible participants were adults (age ≥ 18 years) of both sexes recruited through institutional and personal contacts of each of the study’s researchers as well as through social media. No gender, educational, health, social, and cultural selection were intended. Participants were asked to report their sex, age, as well as their weight and height, which were used to calculate their body mass index (BMI) (body mass index (BMI) = kg/m2). Based on an anticipated Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)) of 0.5 (moderate agreement) and an accepTable 95% confidence interval (95%CI) width of 0.4 [19], as well as a minimum desirable size for Bland Altman plots [20], we aimed at a sample population of N~50 respondents per country.

The study was performed according to the principles established by the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants signed an informed consent before enrollment. Data from food diaries and food frequency questionnaires were handled as personal data according to the European law and subjected to pseudonymisation before statistical analysis (a code was assigned to each participant’s food diary and food frequency questionnaire, by a different investigator from the one performing the analysis).  2.2.

Using the validated 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scoring instrument from the PREDIMED study [6], we designed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) questionnaire to calculate the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) in the different countries taking part in the study (Supplementary Table S1). The questionnaire was thoroughly revised, discussed and then translated into the language of each participant country by a local committee formed by researchers involved in the study.",998330c0-a406-473b-b17c-4f292494ef5e

A second questionnaire food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) (2) was sent or presented a week after collection of the first questionnaire. The criteria defined for the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) (Supplementary Table S1) were used to calculate the Mediterranean diet adherence score from the 3d-FD and from the two separate questionnaires. The final Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score can range between 0 and 14.

A negative kappa represents agreement worse than expected or disagreement with low negative values (0.00 to −0.10) generally being interpreted as “no agreement” and large negative kappa representing a great disagreement [26].  The agreement between the two methods was additionally verified by implementing the graphical analysis recommended by Bland and Altman which plots the “difference” in the score between the two methods (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)—3d-FD) on the Y-axis against the “mean value” of the two scores ((food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) + 3d-FD)/2) on the X-axis [27].",17e3a8ac-6667-4d60-b654-ec6ec914521c

19,methods19," Discussion Questionnaires measuring and scoring adherence to the MD are considered suitable tools for identifying the dietary habits of a given population and for analyzing their association with the potential health benefits of this diet [5,30]. Amongst the various scores that have been developed to measure MD adherence, the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) screening tool was previously validated for the Spanish population in the PREDIMED study [6] and has been widely investigated for its applicability in several other countries around the world [7,8,9,10]. However, a simultaneous and global validation of the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scoring system in countries around the European Mediterranean region had not been previously undertaken. In the present study, we provide for the first time, comprehensive validation data of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) in several Southern European Mediterranean countries, i.e.",5e5047ee-0b4d-4725-b405-c0969a7bb01c
20,methods20,", GR, PT, IT, SP, and CY as well as in two Balkan bordering countries, North Macedonia (NMK) and BG.  One of the limitations attributed to the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) was that this score was validated for a specific sample population (i.e., 55–80 years old at a high risk for coronary heart disease), and thus, the results could not be extrapolated to the general population. Moreover, the score was compared to a long (137-item) food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) as the reference method [6]. Both, food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and food diaries have been previously employed as validation reference methods of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) in different countries [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14].",435750bd-55bc-44ab-8d9d-fd4ec4cc0293
21,methods21," Although food records are not free from errors, they have been recommended for validating food-frequency questionnaires [20] since they minimize errors related to recall and perception of portion sizes, and also, the measurement errors of the food records do not correlate with those of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) [9,20,31]. In this study, we have analyzed the validity of the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) in a general adult population (>18 years old) from different Southern European countries (no other restriction criteria were applied) using a 3d-FD record as a reference method.",681c4df0-3cb8-4510-9b7e-adf80ad34198
22,methods22," Since there is not a gold standard unique protocol, we have implemented, globally and in each separate country, a number of analyses recommended to quantify the agreement between methods: (1) test–retest reliability [32], (2) relative and absolute comparison using Pearson correlation, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), and food items comparison by κ statistics analysis, and (3) Bland–Altman graphical analysis of the difference between methods [19,20].  Overall, the reliability of our food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) was good to very good both in the global population as well as in each separate country reinforcing the good stability of the questionnaire over time [9].",c176d5bc-3f1b-410c-bdc0-86495b6c33c1
23,methods23," Regarding validity and based on the Pearson and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) correlations, the agreement between the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and the reference 3d-FD was in general categorized as moderate but with individual countries like GR, which reached excellent agreement while BG and North Macedonia (NMK) displayed a lower concordance. Compared with the validation analysis of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) in Spain [6], and though the Spanish sample tested in our study (N = 40) was much smaller than that used in the PREDIMED study (N = 7146), the correlation results were very similar (r = 0.50 and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.44 in our study vs. r = 0.52 and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.51 in the PREDIMED study [6]). Likewise, the validation results attained in our Portuguese sample population (r = 0.597 and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.",ebe1d13f-d71c-4f51-8d1e-aa68b2fc057d

The validation of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) against the 3d-FD in a non-Mediterranean country (UK) also showed a similar moderate agreement (r = 0.50, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.53) leading those authors to suggest that the potential of this tool to measure MD adherence was similar in Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries [9]. In contrast, in the non-Mediterranean countries examined by us, North Macedonia (NMK) and BG, correlation was poorer than in the Mediterranean participants supporting the need and relevance of further exploring and validating dietary questionnaires in each different country or community investigated.",0f2fb754-d584-4807-9697-626662e06336
25,methods25,"  To further investigate whether any of the differences found in the validation in each separate country might be related to differences in the validation at the food item level, we performed κ analyses of each of the components of the questionnaire. The results supported a general fair to moderate concordance for many of the food items principally in GR, PT, IT, and SP as well as in the entire sample population examined. On the other hand, poorer κ values were found in CY and North Macedonia (NMK). In agreement with κ statistics reported in previous similar validation studies [6,7,9,13], we observed that, in general, and with independence of the country and sample population examined, the fair to moderate levels of agreement prevail for most items, and only a few food items reach higher concordance.

[14] and our Portuguese sample showed equivalent results for only three items, i.e., butter, sweet drinks and “sofrito” in the Spanish example and olive oil quantity, vegetables, and butter in the Portuguese case. As indicated by other researchers in the area, different factors can influence these results such as the responders’ ability to remember, describe, and quantify food consumption [14]. Even when the same individuals responded to the same questionnaires within a 3-month difference, the κ analysis per food item showed substantial variability [7]. The κ results are also biased by food items where the total sample population investigated gave the same response (i.e., it is not a variable), and thus, it is not susceptible for the analysis.",73d5775b-02d0-49be-8908-00125c3f3825
27,methods27," This was the case of, for example, using olive oil to cook in the sample populations from SP, IT, and GR, where all respondents scored 1 (normally use olive oil to cook). This situation was also particularly apparent in the case of the sample population from BG with eight food items where the score was the same for all participants. Further studies with larger sample population may mitigate this issue.  We next applied the Bland–Altman graphical analysis which is considered one of the most suitable ways to compare methods and that allows for quantification of the concordance between mean differences, as well as concordance of the variability in all individuals (95% agreement intervals) [27,33]. Our analyses were indicative of a general overestimation bias of the MD adherence by the 14-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire as compared with the 3d-FD.",29175c51-f624-4ed0-bc59-47a876184d1e
28,methods28," Nevertheless, there was no trend in the difference between methods as the average increased (absence of systematic bias), and the scatter of values around the bias line was consistent (Figure 1). These results are in good agreement with previous reports where it has been shown that the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) yielded a higher score than other food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) or food records both in European [6,7,9] and non-European countries [10,11]. Furthermore, the size of the overestimation was highly variable with bias between methods ranging from a minimum value of 0.1 unit in North Macedonia (NMK) to almost 2.0 units in SP. Similar variability in the mean differences between methods has also been reported in previous studies, with values < 0.5 units as in the PREDIMED validation conducted in Spain (0.25 units) [6] or in an adapted version of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) in Korea (0.",41d63968-5039-43a5-b8e7-8d4a74a3285a

Our results also show that with independence of the country and sample size, most individual data lay within the estimated LOAs. However, and as in previous published similar analyses [7,9,10], these LOAs cover a rather broad range of differences between methods (~between 4 and 8 units, including negative and positive values). As it has been recently reviewed about the use and reporting of Bland–Altman analyses [28], key information is usually missing in many of those studies: (i) how big the average discrepancy between methods (bias) is acceptable, and (ii) how wide the LOAs can be so that the results are not too ambiguous. These two key points have not yet been addressed within the context of MD adherence measurement.",b757c069-605b-4bb0-96dc-ca9f9a0ca888
30,methods30," Based on previous analyses [6,7,9,10] and our own results in the Southern European sample population examined, we suggest that a mean acceptable bias must be at least ≤1.0 units for a more accurate qualification of the MD adherence, but future research in the area should continue contributing to delineate this minimum size. It is also essential that acceptable LOAs between the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and reference methods are established and that we continue investigating the factors that may influence these values.  Overall, and taking into consideration the results of all the analyses implemented, a global moderate validation for the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) against the 3d-FD was estimated for the complete Southern European population examined.",cc91a393-0eec-4f8e-baf2-fc1ac0fa5451
31,methods31," Regarding the individual countries, it appears that the validation was slightly better in the Mediterranean countries but establishing a clear ranking order in the validation performance was, however, not trivial. On the whole, the sample population from GR clearly displayed the best validation scores. The rest of the Mediterranean countries PT, IT, CY, and SP had all moderate levels of agreement but exhibited higher bias values. On the other hand, North Macedonia (NMK) and BG, which had the lowest correlation values, performed better in the Bland–Altman analysis with the lowest bias values between the two methods. These results confirm differences in the validation performance between countries and reinforce the need to establish improved standardized protocols and qualification criteria to better differentiate MD adherence between countries.",6f9d4b7c-cdb9-445b-9c2b-438e3dec46bb
32,methods32,"  With regards to the estimated 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores, in this exploratory study, we found a moderate MD adherence (6.22 ± 2.01) in the whole investigated group of Southern European Mediterranean countries and were ranked from highest to lowest score as follows: SP >> IT > PT > CY ≅ GR >> North Macedonia (NMK) > BG. These results show that despite the differences in the validation performance, the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) had some capacity to differentiate between a weaker adherence for the Balkan countries against a fair-to-moderate adherence for the Mediterranean representatives. These results are not too dissimilar from those previously reported using another Mediterranean score, the Mediterranean adequacy index (Mediterranean adequacy index (MAI)).",ba5658df-5aa5-4a17-ac82-fc19276e720d
33,methods33," These countries (except North Macedonia (NMK), no information available) were ranked from best to worst Mediterranean adequacy index (MAI) as follows: GR > IT > SP > PT > BG > CY. They were also reported to have reduced their Mediterranean adequacy index (MAI) scores in the last decades, indicating a shift away from the traditional MD pattern [34]. Further, the sample population from SP, which exhibited the highest adherence to the MD, reached an average Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) of 8.35 ± 1.65 and was very close to the value attained in the PREDIMED validation study (8.68 ± 1.90) [6]. Moreover, our estimated IT, PT, and GR 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores (6.86 ± 1.63, 6.55 ± 1.98 and 6.32 ± 1.68, respectively) were not too dissimilar from the previously published scores of 7.34 ± 1.9 in Southern Italy [35], 7.29 ± 2.15 in a population of Portuguese adults from Lisbon [14], and 6.40 ± 1.",e3cc88ad-2b37-47de-b0ec-cca9ea44277b
34,methods34,"90 in a sample population of Greek students [36] and were all classified in the fair-to-moderate adherence range [22]. Conversely, in non-Mediterranean European countries, the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores were lower such as in the UK study with a value of 5.47 ± 2.09 [9]. Overall, these data show a reasonable agreement with previously published Mediterranean scores and support some validity of this instrument to categorize MD adherence in different populations.  It has been already indicated that factors like age, ethnic group, gender, and (or) health status of a population can affect the outcome of the validation of dietary assessment [20,37]. Misreporting is a common reason for the differences found between dietary assessment instruments and can be influenced by factors such as sex [38] or body mass index (BMI), with the probability of underreporting increasing with a higher body mass index (BMI) [39].",f7fdb471-f859-4c00-ab9c-af0089e715e0
35,methods35," In the same way, the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score has also been reported to be influenced by sex [36] or age [35] as well as having a negative association with body mass index (BMI), i.e., higher 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score is correlated with lower body mass index (BMI) [22]. Our analyses further corroborate this negative relationship between body mass index (BMI) and the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score as well as between body mass index (BMI) and the validation of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score against the 3d-FD score, which may partially contribute to explain the results attained in North Macedonia (NMK) and BG both countries with a significant higher percentage of participants with overweight and obesity than in the other countries.",8f57f397-d47f-4013-a56f-e70e1bfe98c3
36,methods36," With the increasing numbers of overweight people in Europe, it is of utmost importance that we carefully scrutinize the development, modification, and application of diet adherence measurement tools as well as the factors influencing their implementation.  The main strength of our study is that this is the first time that the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) has been simultaneously validated in a number of different countries around the Southern European Mediterranean area using the same methodology (a range of well-recommended analyses), and thus, comparisons between them were feasible. The results confirm a fair-to-moderate validation of this tool in the general adult population from those countries and supports its potential applicability to comparatively differentiate MD adherence between Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean European countries; however, an accurate and complete ranking of the countries was not accomplished.",3b6fb6d2-1234-45a1-952b-62ae76fc0805
37,methods37," Our study has, nonetheless, a number of limitations, i.e., the participation of more volunteers with overweight and obesity in some of the countries, certain difficulty in reporting some foods and portion sizes by the participants, and the limited sample size achieved in some of the investigated countries. In this exploratory analysis, we have preliminarily addressed the body mass index (BMI) influence on the validation of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), but more studies in larger populations are needed to further (1) confirm and improve the suitability of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) tool in these and other countries of the Mediterranean area and of Europe as a whole, (2) optimize the accuracy of the self-report instruments by increasing our knowledge of the interindividual variability in underreporting and of the factors that influence this variability, e.g.",c3ff11c2-f006-4bad-bdca-9de4f344368d
38,methods38,", differences between types of foods or the individual’s characteristics that affect the responses to dietary questionnaires such as body mass index (BMI) or health status [40] and (3) address the need to adjust in MD studies the effects of specific dietary choices (i.e., vegetarian/vegan subpopulations) [41] or those of alcohol consumption (alcoholic drinkers vs. non-alcoholic drinkers) [42]. Overall, and since the assessment of dietary habits remains essential to advance in the understanding of the diet-health binomial, it is important that we further elaborate and improve standard validation protocols with specific application to measure MD adherence and with a focus on establishing common criteria to optimize the acceptance or rejection of the validation so that more meaningful and accurate comparison between different sample populations becomes possible.
