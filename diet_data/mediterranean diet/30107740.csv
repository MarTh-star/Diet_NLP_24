First, in a validation study, 168 community-dwelling persons were invited to participate and an inflammatory aging disease (inflammatory aging disease (IAD)) score of each participant was calculated by total number of inflammatory aging disease (IAD)s. Second, in the nutritional epidemiologic study, we calculated the edietary inflammatory index (DII) for 1464 participants and compared the edietary inflammatory index (DII) with healthy diet quality scores.

1,results0,"In a validation study, when subjects were classified by edietary inflammatory index (DII) tertile, a higher edietary inflammatory index (DII) was significantly associated with a higher inflammatory aging disease (IAD) score. In the nutritional epidemiologic study, a higher edietary inflammatory index (DII) was inversely associated with the Mediterranean diet score, the World Health Organization's healthy diet indicator, and the American Heart Association's recommended healthy diet score.  Conclusions The edietary inflammatory index (DII) is an easy and valid instrument to assess the inflammatory potential of dietary factors. This index is easy to use and does not require detailed estimations of nutrient intake.  Highlights • We developed a new and simple index to capture the inflammatory potential of diet.  • The new index is based on 8 pro-inflammatory and 8 anti-inflammatory components.  • This index is related to an inflammatory aging disease score.",1f292bdb-0e4a-4544-a21d-03e466f11700

Keywords Chronic inflammationDietary inflammatory indexMediterranean diet ==== Body 1 Introduction Chronic inflammation plays an important role in the development of several chronic diseases [1]. Because various nutrients and foods have been shown to modulate inflammation, habitual dietary patterns may play a role in the regulation of chronic inflammation [2]. One of the widely used indexes to assess the inflammatory potential of dietary factors is the dietary inflammatory index (dietary inflammatory index (DII)), which is based on 45 dietary factors including macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, spices, and herbs [3]. Another dietary inflammatory index (DII) based on 9 pro-inflammatory and 9 anti-inflammatory foods was also developed [4].",8e0c6b2b-92d8-4aea-ba0b-37904a4be43a
3,results2," However, both indexes were developed using daily amounts of food or nutrient consumption and require complicated calculations, which are difficult to use in clinical practice. We developed a new and simple index, based solely on the frequency of consumption of only 16 foods, to capture the inflammatory potential of diet.  2 Materials & methods The new index, an empirical dietary inflammatory index (edietary inflammatory index (DII)), is based on 8 pro-inflammatory components (red meats, processed meats, organ meats, other fish, eggs, sugar-sweetened beverages, tomatoes, and refined grains) and 8 anti-inflammatory components (leafy green vegetables, dark yellow vegetables, fruit juice, oily fish, coffee, tea, wine, and beer or other alcohol beverages). Food components of our edietary inflammatory index (DII) are based on the dietary inflammatory index (DII) proposed by Tabung et al. [4] with minor modifications.",fe6c7361-55ec-4a24-83c1-d81554e68bcf
4,results3," However, our edietary inflammatory index (DII) is different from the conventional dietary inflammatory index (DII), which uses calculations based on daily amounts of foods or nutrient consumption. In contrast, our edietary inflammatory index (DII) is based on the frequency of consumption of various foods, that is, how many times per week (or how many bowls or cups per day) a subject consumed. The framework for the scoring system of the edietary inflammatory index (DII) was designed using the Mediterranean diet pyramid [5] and its related literature [6]. Each pro-inflammatory component was scored 0, 1, or 2 points, and anti-inflammatory components was scored 0, -1, or -2 points (Table 1). Exceptionally, we set an upper limit for alcohol consumption based on data from the dose-response meta-analysis [7] because excessive alcohol is inflammatory. Total scores ranged from −16 to +16, with a higher score indicating a higher inflammatory potential.",78f5597b-4984-496a-80a8-91e7915297f2

6,results5,"    First, in a validation study, 168 community-dwelling persons (104 men and 64 women) were invited to participate in the Kashiba Silver Agers Healthy Longevity Study (KASAHeL Study, Kashiba, Japan). The inflammatory aging disease (inflammatory aging disease (IAD)) score of each participant was calculated by total number of inflammatory aging disease (IAD)s: cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, dementia, depression, and sarcopenia. Chi-square test was used to compare distribution of inflammatory aging disease (IAD) score by edietary inflammatory index (DII) tertile.  Second, in nutritional epidemiologic study, we calculated the edietary inflammatory index (DII) for 1464 participants (788 men and 676 women) from 8 workplaces, 1 university, and 3 communities from our pervious studies [[8], [9], [10]].",d3411ef6-5f3a-4522-9ab3-7fce61e37856
7,results6," We compared the edietary inflammatory index (DII) with their healthy diet quality scores: the Mediterranean diet score adapted to Japanese (jMDS) [8], the World Health Organization's healthy diet indicator (WHO-HDI) [9], and the American Heart Association's recommended healthy diet score (AHA-HDS) [10].  3 Results In a validation study, the edietary inflammatory index (DII) scores in our subjects ranged from −7 to +8, and scores were distributed symmetrically (data not shown). The proportion of higher inflammatory aging disease (IAD) score significantly increased across edietary inflammatory index (DII) tertile (p = 0.018) (Table 2).Table 2 The inflammatory aging disease (IAD) distribution across tertile of the edietary inflammatory index (DII).

In the nutritional epidemiologic study, we compared the edietary inflammatory index (DII) to three healthy diet scores.

The framework for the construction of our edietary inflammatory index (DII) was designed using previous dietary inflammatory indexes [3,4]. However, previous indexes were calculated using daily amounts of food or nutrient consumption, which is difficult to calculate in daily clinical practice [3,4]. In contrast, the edietary inflammatory index (DII) is based solely on the frequency of consumption of various foods. Therefore, most questions are easy to answer, and the index allows for a rapid estimation of dietary inflammatory potential without the need for detailed dietary records.",2b34a159-ce91-4f14-b2ad-66e322cc266f
10,results9,"  Our study has several limitations. First, the edietary inflammatory index (DII) was not construct validated using circulating inflammatory biomarkers. However, circulating biomarkers only represent the current inflammatory status. Because the edietary inflammatory index (DII) is expressed by daily eating habits, the validation test may be more reasonable when compared to the inflammatory aging disease (IAD) score. In the present study, a moderate association between edietary inflammatory index (DII) and inflammatory aging disease (IAD) scores was confirmed. Second, our index was empirically based to construct the scoring system; therefore, we must consider whether the trichotomous cut-offs (0, 1, and 2 points) are the best way to assess dietary factors.  5 Conclusions The edietary inflammatory index (DII) is an easy and valid instrument to assess the inflammatory potential of dietary factors. This index is easy to use and does not require detailed estimations of nutrient intake.",cd20ec11-c1dc-45c0-8a13-3d8380f29f44
