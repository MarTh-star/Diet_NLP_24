0,introduction0,"Early prediction of obesity risk will be facilitated by the identification of the main genes and their relevant genetic variants. However, the next step involving more successful obesity prevention and therapy will better achieve after learning how the phenotypic expression of the relevant genetic variants are modulated by pertinent lifestyle factors such as dietary intake and physical activity in order to reduce the manifestation of obesity in genetically predisposed individuals. Outstanding among the many genes associated with obesity is the fat mass and obesity gene (Fat mass and obesity (FTO)). It was the first locus discovered to be associated with body mass index (BMI) and obesity risk [1]. One year after, a meta-analysis of several genome wide association studies GWAs [2], established that the second most important locus associated with body mass index (BMI) was the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (MC4R).",f4357438-a7a0-4249-9f61-f688ca4e26ab
1,introduction1," Previous studies had already identified various rare mutations in the MC4R as the commonest cause of monogenic forms of early-onset obesity [3], [4]. Of the various polymorphisms found both in the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) and in the MC4R loci, the most significant are rs9939609 and rs17782313, respectively [1], [2], [4]. The minor allele of the rs9939609 (C>A), has been consistently associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and obesity risk [1], [5]–[8]. In a meta-analysis of population-based studies [1], the per-A allele odds ratio (OR) for obesity was 1.31 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23–1.39]. Although the minor allele of the rs17782313 (T>C), has also been significantly associated with greater body mass index (BMI) [2], [4], [9]–[11], its relevance in terms of the magnitude of the association is considered smaller than that of Fat mass and obesity (FTO) polymorphism, being the per-allele OR for obesity of 1.12 (95% CI: 1.08–1.16) in the initial meta-analysis [2].",2fce9aa5-59ed-40d6-bc9a-12cd23eb24dd
2,introduction2," A few studies have also jointly analyzed the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) and MC4R polymorphisms, describing their additive effects on obesity related variables [1], [9], [12], [13]. Thus in a European population, Cauchi et al [13] found that, compared to participants carrying neither Fat mass and obesity (FTO) nor MC4R risk allele, subjects with three or four risk alleles had a 1.8-fold increased obesity risk.  The mechanism by which these polymorphisms may be associated with greater body mass index (BMI) is unknown, but some studies on animals have suggested that for both of them it could be through a higher food intake [14]–[16]. However, human studies investigating the associations of these polymorphisms with dietary intake are scarce and contradictory [17]–[26].",10f609fb-d4dc-4ca8-a128-875ca28f17ca
3,introduction3," Although initial studies [17]–[19] have reported that Fat mass and obesity (FTO) polymorphisms were associated with higher fat and energy intake in carriers of the variant alleles, other studies have not been able to replicate these associations [20]–[23]. Studies on the MC4R locus are few and also divergent [23]–[26], requiring more research. Likewise, whereas several studies have found an important statistical interaction with physical activity for the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) locus, so that greater physical activity attenuates the increasing effects of the A-allele on body mass index (BMI) [27]–[29], for the MC4R polymorphism there are hardly any studies that have analyzed this interaction [30], [31].  Although recently several studies analyzed the possible modulation of the effects of the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) polymorphisms on body mass index (BMI) through diet, the results are still differing [22], [32]–[35].",d13f406f-5a55-4558-a8c6-ca47a98abb85
4,introduction4," This, and the lack of studies focused on gene-diet interactions of the MC4R polymorphism, make it necessary to carry out new research on these gene-diet interactions considering both loci jointly. Moreover, although the vast majority of studies have focused on statistical interactions [36], [37], we also have the so-called “biological interactions” in which environmental factors could modify genetic susceptibility without the interaction term in the mathematical model being statistically significant [36]–[39]. Hence our aims were: 1) To analyze the associations of the MC4R rs17782313 and Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphisms with body mass index (BMI) and their modulation by physical activity and diet, including the overall adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) pattern; 2) To study whether these polymorphisms have an influence on food and alcohol intake in a high cardiovascular risk population.

5,methods0,"Subjects We included 7,052 participants (3,008 men and 4,044 women) from the PREDIMED (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) study from whom DNA was isolated, the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) polymorphism (rs9939609) determined, and who had valid data for the main clinical and lifestyle variables analyzed at baseline. In 7,019 of them, the MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism was successfully determined. The PREDIMED study is a multi-center clinical trial (controlled-trials.com number, ISRCTN35739639) aimed at assessing the effects of the MedDiet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [40]. The 7,052 participants analyzed here did not differ in the main characteristics from those of the total cohort (n = 7,447). Details of the PREDIMED Study have been fully described elsewhere [41]. Briefly, from October 2003 potential high cardiovascular risk subjects were selected by physicians in Primary Care Centers.",2ed70194-09af-4816-af23-cf3c5700ad2c
6,methods1," Eligible subjects were community-dwelling people (55–80 years of age for men; 60–80 years of age for women) who fulfilled at least one of two criteria: Type 2 diabetes; 3 or more cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, body mass index [body mass index (BMI)] ≥25 kg/m2, current smoking, or a family history of premature cardiovascular disease). The specific cut-off points for these eligibility criteria have been previously described [41]. Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria [42]. Exclusion criteria included a personal history of cardiovascular disease, any severe chronic illness, and drug or alcohol addiction [41]. Participants were randomly assigned to three interventions [41]. In this study we analyzed data at baseline.",263efdd6-e132-40d1-8f93-e43b54ca5126

All participants provided written informed consent.  Demographic, Clinical, Anthropometric and Dietary Measurements The baseline examination included assessment of standard cardiovascular risk factors, medication use, socio-demographic factors and lifestyle variables, as previously detailed [41].",3f22d983-9019-4c51-bd3b-c8ea9eb75f50
8,methods3," Food intake and alcoholic beverage consumption, including wine, beer, and spirits, were assessed through a validated semi-quantitative 137-item food frequency questionnaire [43]. Energy and nutrient intake were calculated from Spanish food composition tables [44]. We calculated alcohol intake (g/d) for each individual on the basis of the type and amount of alcoholic beverages by multiplying the amount of the beverage (mL) by the respective grade (% alcohol) and the constant 0.80 to transform alcohol volumes into weight. In addition, three groups of alcohol consumption were defined according to the reported daily intake of alcohol: no intake (0 g/d), moderate intake (<26.4 g/d for men and <13.2 g/d for women), and high intake (26.4 g/d for men and 13.2 g/d for women). These gram amounts correspond to 1 drink/d for women and 2 drinks/d for men [45].",9e8fe03b-20e6-4c14-8c81-6396fb81602d
9,methods4,"  The baseline examination also included the administration of a validated 14-item questionnaire indicating the degree of adherence to the traditional MedDiet [46]. This screener consists of 14 questions on food consumption frequency and on food intake habits considered characteristic of the Spanish MedDiet. Each question was scored 0 or 1. The final score ranged from 0 to 14. The greater the score obtained from the questionnaire, the greater the adherence to the MedDiet. Dichotomous variables of adherence to the MedDiet and nutrient intake were created using as cut-off points the sample means. Physical activity was estimated by the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, validated for its use in Spanish subjects [47], [48].  Weight and height were measured with calibrated scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer, respectively. body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.",d505df10-5c2a-40ba-85f5-f3aff6f11301
10,methods5,"  DNA Extraction and Genotyping At baseline, blood samples were obtained from each participant after an overnight fast and were frozen at −80°C and shipped to central laboratories for analyses [35]. Genomic DNA was extracted from buffy-coat with the MagNaPure LC DNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The MC4R rs17782313 and Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphisms were genotyped on a 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, FosterCity, CA, USA) using fluorescent allelic discrimination TaqManTM assays. The calling rate for both polymorphisms was >95%. For quality control purposes, 5% of samples were randomly selected samples and genotyped a second time. There were no discrepancies between the two results.  Statistical Analyses Chi-square tests were used to test differences between observed and expected genotype frequencies, assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and to test differences in percentages.",eecb113d-fc60-4190-b2ad-09a99206b4bc
11,methods6," Genetic variables were tested using co-dominant models of the polymorphisms individually. In addition, an additive genetic score was created from the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) and the MC4R polymorphism so that the presence of each of variant allele for each polymorphism was scored as one point according to the work of Cauchi et al [13]. The range of values of this aggregate score variable was from 0 (homozygous subjects for non-variant alleles) to 4 points (homozygous subjects for the variant alleles both at the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) and MC4R genes). In addition, due to the low prevalence of homozygous subjects for the variant alleles, a grouped score variable was created grouping the categories of 3 and 4 points as previously described [13]. We used t and ANOVA tests to compare crude means of obesity indexes across genetic categories. Multivariate adjustments for comparisons of continuous variables were carried out by generalized linear models.",3dafb1b0-1ddc-428c-9875-59bc8157b74d
12,methods7," Models were first adjusted for age, sex, center and diabetes. Additional adjustments for energy intake, physical activity, adherence to the MedDiet or body mass index (BMI) were also carried out as indicated. In addition to the categorical analysis, the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) and the MC4R polymorphism were considered in the co-dominant model as linear terms coded 0, 1, or 2 (additive effect), depending of the number of variant alleles with the homozygote wild-type coded as 0. The regression coefficient (B) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated for each polymorphism. This coefficient indicates the change of Y for each variant allele of the tested polymorphism. Likewise, the aggregate score was also considered as a linear term coded as 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the number of variant alleles. The corresponding B and 95%CI for the aggregate score was also estimated in the unadjusted and adjusted regression models.",d9538ec3-19a0-4df1-aca1-eb28caaa752b
13,methods8,"  Dichotomous variables for dietary variables and physical activity were created using as cut-off the sample means. Alcohol intake was square-root transformed for statistical testing. Logistic regression methods were also used to estimate the associations of the MC4R rs17782313 and Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphisms to predict obesity prevalence and to adjust for confounders as indicated. In addition to the categorical analysis, the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) and the MC4R polymorphism were considered in the co-dominant model as linear terms coded 0, 1, or 2 (allele dosage effect), depending of the number of variant alleles with the homozygote wild-type coded as 0.

The corresponding B and 95%CI for the aggregate score were also estimated in the unadjusted and adjusted regression models.  The homogeneity of the effects by sex was also statistically tested using the likelihood ratio test. To test the interaction between the MC4R rs17782313, the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphisms or their score variable and physical activity, adherence to MedDiet or the other dietary variables, separated multivariate regression models including the corresponding main effects and interaction terms in addition to the potential confounders, were fitted. The likelihood ratio test was used to obtain the P values for interactions. Stratified analyses were also carried out.

To detect these reported effects our sample size (n = 7,019) had a power higher that 80% (alpha-level = 0.05).",582f15d6-4302-4bbd-9a17-29a4e5e1a88b
16,methods11," Our study was adequately powered (>80%) to detect as statistically significant a 7% per-allele increase in the OR for obesity for the additive effects of both polymorphism in the aggregate score in the population as a whole. The power to detect a statistically significant gene-environment interaction effect higher than OR 1.20 in the logistic regression model (using a dichotomous environmental variable based on the population mean) was >95% for the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) (additive effects) and >80% for the MC4R. However, as the gene-interaction effect of the MC4R was 1.10, the power to detect this interaction as statistically significant was <50%. For the aggregate score, the power to detect the above described additive gene-environment interaction effects in determining obesity was >80%.",4193703b-9098-4b89-9317-7615d27e3d8b

With a sample size of 7019 individuals our study has a power>80% to detect this interaction effect for the different outcomes analyzed.

These effects can be considered clinically relevant in magnitude. Moreover, for waist circumference, higher adherence to the MedDiet significantly reversed the genetic effect. Thus, average waist circumference in AA subjects having high adherence to the MedDiet was significantly lower than average waist circumference in TT subjects with low adherence (mean±SE: 100.4±0.4 cm vs 101.5±0.3 cm, respectively; P = 0.033).",1ca71314-fdef-4219-888c-aa84848b6705
31,results19,"  Similar results were observed when analyzing the aggregate score of both polymorphisms on body mass index (BMI) ( Figure 3A ) or waist circumference ( Figure 3B ). Although we did not obtain statistically significant interactions between adherence to the MedDiet and the aggregate score on body mass index (BMI) (P-interaction = 0.844) or on waist circumference (P-interaction = 0.981), we observed a “biological interaction”. Despite we did not find statistically significant differences in the slopes of the aggregate score in the two strata of adherence to MedDiet (B1∶0.19; 95%CI: 0.05–0.34 in the low strata vs B2∶0.16; 95%CI: 0.02–0.29 in the high strata) and the B1/B2 ratio was <1.2 (absence of a statistically significant interaction), we clearly observed that the body mass index (BMI) of individuals with higher genetic risk will depend on their greater o lesser adherence to the MedDiet (“biological interaction”).",fc19b945-8d32-4ee0-ab97-c17057e40442

Interestingly, high adherence to the MedDiet in individuals genetically susceptible (carriers of 4 or 3 variant alleles) counterbalanced their genetic predisposition to higher body mass index (BMI), exhibiting similar average body mass index (BMI) than individuals with no risk alleles and lower adherence to the MedDiet (mean±SE: 29.8±0.2 vs 30.0±0.2 kg/m2, respectively; P = 0.502). For waist circumference we observed similar results.

Moreover, it remained statistically significant even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) (B = −0.57 g/d per-variant allele; 95%CI: −0.89, −0.25). Per types of alcoholic beverages, we obtained similar results (less consumption in carriers of the variant alleles) for the most consumed alcoholic beverages in this population (wine and beer).",3a9c89f6-f0e4-47c7-996f-fb1b49184ce0

Likewise, prevalence of subject with high-alcohol consumption was higher in subjects with zero variant alleles (14.5%) than in those with 4 variant alleles (5.7%); P-trend = 0.01).

However, the MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism did not reach the statistical significance as it had a lesser effect in this population and, even though a similar trend was observed.",5f95846b-348d-4a3c-a1c3-d03650fb0c15
38,discussion1," While several studies have reported statistically significant associations between the MC4R rs17782313 and body mass index (BMI) or obesity [2], [24], [25], [51], there are also studies that did not find a significant association [9], [52] or found stronger associations with weight than body mass index (BMI) [11] and even studies that have reported an association with higher height [9], [53], [54] and that this association may mask the effects on body mass index (BMI) despite being associated with higher weight. Our results are in agreement with this observation as we found statistically significant differences in weight and height (although very small in magnitude for height).In agreement with other studies [12], [13] we have also found additive effects of these polymorphisms in this population.",f7d61cab-b754-497c-bccf-a064ea08cf12
39,discussion2," We observed that the aggregate score of both was associated with higher body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and obesity prevalence with higher statistical significance and higher magnitude of the effect than the independent polymorphisms.  Interestingly, the magnitude of effects of the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) and MC4R polymorphisms were not homogeneous in the whole population. Regarding interactions of these polymorphisms with lifestyle variables, many studies have analyzed the statistical interaction of the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) polymorphism with physical activity obtaining some different results depending on the population [8], [12], [22], [27], [28], [30], [32], [55]. However, a recent meta-analysis including 218,166 adults and 19,268 children [29] concluded that there was a consistent statistically significant interaction between the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphism and physical activity on obesity risk.",7ecd51b2-3b40-4c0e-aae0-af1607eb1b97
40,discussion3," Thus, in sedentary subjects the association of the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) polymorphisms with higher body mass index (BMI) or obesity risk was greater in magnitude than in active subjects. In agreement with these results, we also found a consistent statistically significant interaction between the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphism and leisure time physical activity in determining body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and obesity prevalence, so that the association between the Fat mass and obesity (FTO)-risk allele and higher body mass index (BMI) or obesity prevalence disappeared in active subjects and was increased in magnitude of the effect and clinical significance in subjects with low physical activity. We did not find any significant interaction between physical activity and the MC4R rs17782313 on body mass index (BMI), waist circumference or obesity, but observed a similar trend.",489afeaa-6e28-455e-91bd-54f65b212f5a
41,discussion4," A lack of power to detect the statistical significance was identified for the MC4R polymorphism taking into account the lower prevalence of the risk-allele and the lower magnitude of the effect of this polymorphism. However, on considering the aggregate score of the MC4R rs17782313 and Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609, we did observe a statistically significant interaction both for body mass index (BMI) and for obesity. As far as we know this is the first time that a statistically significant interaction between the aggregate score of the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) and the MC4R polymorphisms and physical activity on body mass index (BMI) and obesity is reported. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect of this interaction was strong and can be considered as clinically relevant.",f8e01228-5f8d-4296-975f-fc8839906dce
42,discussion5,"  With regard to the modulation of the effects of these polymorphisms by diet, there are few studies that have analyzed it in comparison with physical activity, and the consistency level is still low [22], [24], [32]–[35], [56], [57], [58]. Sonestedt et al [32] reported a statistically significant interaction between diet and the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphism on body mass index (BMI) and found that a high total fat and a low carbohydrate intake boosted the effects of this polymorphism. In another study [22], we concluded that saturated fatty acids were those that presented a more statistically significant and clinically relevant interaction with the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) polymorphism in determining body mass index (BMI) in two American populations. Phillips et al [35] also found a significant interaction with saturated fat intake, replicating our previous findings.",996e106b-a906-4680-afb3-1aab8af4e627
43,discussion6," However, Vimaleswaran et al [33], analyzing data from five European countries reported no statistically significant interaction between the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 and dietary fat, protein or carbohydrate on body mass index (BMI). Regarding the MC4R rs17782313, the number of studies examining gene-diet interactions on anthropometric variables is very scarce [24]. Qi et al [24] reported no significant interactions between the MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism and dietary intake on body mass index (BMI) in The Nurses’ Health Study. In our Mediterranean population we did not find a statistically significant interaction of the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 or the MC4R rs17782313 polymorphisms with either total fat or saturated fat intake (data not shown). This is possible due to the fact that we were dealing with a high overall adherence to the MedDiet population in which in general there is a low saturated fat intake and a high MUFA intake from olive oil.",dbc20ded-52a4-48cd-a115-17f359ca9edc
44,discussion7," We hypothesized that the low or high adherence to the overall MedDiet pattern will be more important than the effect of specific macronutrients. However, when we analyzed the interaction between the adherence to the MedDiet and these polymorphisms on anthropometric variables, we did not find statistically significant gene-diet interactions. The P-values for the interaction terms were non-statistically significant because the effect of the polymorphisms were present (statistically significant) both in the low and the high strata of MedDiet adherence [parallel lines (B1 = B2) in Figure 3]. This was not due to a lack of power to detect the interaction term as statistically significant but to a true absence of heterogeneity of genetic effects between the strata. However, as the MedDiet has also a statistically significant effect on reducing body mass index (BMI) (P<0.05), we observed statistically significant differences between the genotypes depending on the adherence to the MedDiet.",52c1bbe9-b43f-441f-ada5-2c82483ba9fd
45,discussion8," We believe that it is important to stress that these observed results are compatible with the so-called “biological gene-diet interaction” [39], [59]. A biological gene-environment interaction situation takes place when there is an environmental factor capable of modifying genetic susceptibility and it is independent of the statistical significance [38], [59]. This biological interaction is opposed to the genetic determinism, in which the genotype completely determines the phenotype. In the genetic determinism situation, if a subject is a carrier of the risk alleles of the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) and the MC4R polymorphisms, such genetic susceptibility would irreversibly determine the obesity phenotype, and that genetic influence would be totally independent of lifestyle factors.",e1ea6b35-8f55-4ed2-b3e4-a138ef82e096
46,discussion9," However, no genetic determinism will occur when dietary modulation exists (in this case higher adherence to the MedDiet) that could modify genetic susceptibility (greater body mass index (BMI) in variant allele carriers) without the interaction term in the mathematical model being statistically significant. Supporting our cross-sectional results, there is an interventional study carried out in a small sub-sample of the PREDIMED participants [51] showing that after 3 years of nutritional intervention with MedDiet, A-allele carriers for the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 had lower body weight gain than TT subjects. Therefore, it seems important to reconsider the concept of gene-diet interaction and not to discard the potential use of other “biological interactions” that could modify genetic susceptibility without the interaction term in the mathematical model being statistically significant [36]–[39], [59].",ba59bbdf-bc5e-4cc2-b6ff-9936665c0e4c
47,discussion10,"  Regarding dietary intake, we did not find a consistent association of the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) or the MC4R polymorphisms with total energy, fat, carbohydrates o protein intake, in agreement with other studies [21]–[23], [34]. However, we do wish to stress the finding of an important association with alcohol consumption. We have observed that carriers of the variant allele, both for the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 and the MC4R rs17782313 polymorphisms had statistically significant lower alcohol consumption than wild-type subjects. The magnitude of this effect was higher for the aggregate score and remained statistically significant even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). There are no previous studies on humans that have reported an association of the MC4R s17782313 polymorphism with alcohol intake although there are several studies on animals which indicate the great importance of the MC4R in determining alcohol intake [60]–[63].",0510feb5-d7cc-4a9f-b632-e2b2406dab97
48,discussion11," Among them, the work carried out by Navarro et al [61], showing that in mice, when given centrally a melanocortin receptor agonist, melanotan-II reduced ethanol drinking by signalling through the MC4R and suggested that this association is independent of food intake. Therefore our results of the association between the MC4R polymorphism and alcohol intake are novel in humans and mechanistically supported by results in mice [60]–[63]. With regard to Fat mass and obesity (FTO) some studies have analyzed the influence of alcohol intake in humans with varying results [64], [65]. Among them we could mention a study carried out in Poland [65] that, in agreement with our results, also found a lower alcohol intake in carriers of the variant allele of the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphism [49].",c9d40493-ebfc-400e-9706-09d3c2ea9d68
49,discussion12,"  One limitation in our study may be that we have used self-reported measures of diet and physical activity in place of 24-hour record of food intake for diet pedometers or accelerometers that are more objective measures. However, taking into account our large sample size this was not possible due to the high cost that this would involve. Moreover, we have specifically validated the semi-quantitative 137-item food frequency questionnaire [43] as well as the MedDiet adherence questionnaire in this specific population obtaining excellent results [46]. On the other hand, the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire used to measure physical activity as also validated in men [47] and women [48] from the Spanish population.",b3d549a1-e0c5-4129-a73f-39be45c8fc93
50,discussion13,"  In conclusion, we have confirmed the association of the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphism with higher body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and obesity even in a high cardiovascular risk population and described an additive effect of the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) rs9939609 and the MC4R rs17782313 on these obesity-related measures. Moreover, we have found that these genetic effects can be modulated by lifestyle variables, the statistical interaction with physical activity and the biological interaction (not statistically significant) with the adherence to the MedDiet being especially important in magnitude. Although in this population the Fat mass and obesity (FTO) and the MC4R polymorphisms do not have a relevant association with food intake, their association with alcohol consumption is outstanding.",c1309c32-17b4-4a41-aae3-dd039b0753cb
