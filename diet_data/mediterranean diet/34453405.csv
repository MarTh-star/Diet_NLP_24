0,methods0," 2.1. Participants and Study Design  First, a cross-sectional study on 1020 elderly high-cardiovascular-risk Mediterranean subjects was undertaken. Second, a two-sample Mendelian randomization was performed. The recruited white European subjects were participants in the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) Valencia study [59], from the Valencia field center, located on the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain). These participants were recruited in primary healthcare centers, with the following inclusion criteria: elderly (between 55 and 80 years old for men and between 60 and 80 years old for women) and having a high cardiovascular risk, even though they were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline and had plasma fasting glucose determined, as well as successful DNA high-density DNA genotyping for this study (in addition to the other covariates).",c3faea91-3b41-45dd-acba-2a723060f301

Participants provided written informed consent, and the study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Valencia University, Valencia (ethical approval code H1491427097983, 8 May 2017).  Summary data of the association between gut microbiota composition and genetic variants were obtained from four published mbGWAS [43,45,46,51].",6393433a-ed38-40f3-a386-fda6c9f656de

[51] on a large-scale population-based cohort of 5959 individuals with matched gut microbial metagenomes from the FINRISK study. FINRISK is a large Finnish population survey on risk factors in chronic diseases, including subjects aged between 25 and 74 years from six geographical areas of Finland. The study protocol of this study was approved by the Coordinating Ethical Committee of the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District (Ref. 558/E3/2001).

3,methods3," Baseline Anthropometric, Clinical, Biochemical, and Lifestyle Variables  In our Mediterranean population, we assessed demographic variables, cardiovascular risk factors, and clinical and lifestyle variables by validated questionnaires as previously reported [59]. Anthropometric variables and blood pressure were determined at baseline by trained staff. Weight and height were measured with light clothing and no shoes with calibrated scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer, respectively. body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight (in kg) divided by the height (in m2). Blood samples were collected after a 12 h overnight fast. Fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), were measured using standard enzymatic automated methods as previously described [61]. Type 2 diabetes was defined as previously reported [60].",80d8447c-cec6-4ec0-9160-9bdc2f5e66aa

Detailed items of that scale with their response options have been published elsewhere [60,62]. Briefly, the scale consisted of 12 questions on food consumption frequency and two questions on food intake habits considered characteristic of the Mediterranean diet. Each question was scored 0 or 1. The final score ranged from 0 to 14. One point was given for reaching the adherence to the Mediterranean diet recommendation for each item in terms of amount and frequency (olive oil, preferring white meat over red meat,",6edd55c7-d4c5-4279-8746-8411e4b56362

This array captures approximately 720,000 markers (the number varies depending on the version: 730,000 for v.1.0 and 716,000 for v.1.1, with 699,221 markers that are common to both versions of the array). Genome-wide genotyping was performed at the University of Valencia according to the manufacturer’s protocol with appropriate quality standards as previously reported [59].

Using genome-wide genotyping, we undertook various GWASs (crude and adjusted for several confounders) to identify which gene variants were most associated with plasma fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes. Additive genetic models were fitted. General linear models were used for fasting glucose as the dependent variable, and regression coefficients and SE were estimated. Models were sequentially adjusted for sex, age, type 2 diabetes, body mass index (BMI) and diabetes medication. Beta coefficients for the minor allele were obtained.

With type 2 diabetes as the dependent variable, we used logistic regression analysis (unadjusted and adjusted for the indicated potential confounders). Odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Although all the participants were white Caucasians, and no ethnicity bias or population stratification was expected, we checked this potential influence by calculating the genomic inflation factor (lambda coefficient), and it was equal to 1, indicating no genomic inflation. The quantile–quantile plots (Q–Q plots) comparing the expected and observed p-values were performed in the R statistical environment [65].",3c2d77bb-f547-43ed-b8b2-e5fbf7851507

Only the results corresponding to the selected Mi-RSNPs were included in this paper.  2.4. Selection of the Mi-RSNPs from Previously Published mbGWAS and Statistical Analysis  Summary data of the association between gut microbiota composition and genetic variants were obtained from four published mbGWASs [43,45,46,51]. These studies were so-called STD1 [45], STD2 [46], STD3 [51], and STD4 [43] for the purposes of data analysis and tables in this manuscript.",c07560b6-11e3-489a-98dc-c3019bf758bb
10,methods10," Although these studies listed several SNPs as Mi-RSNPs in the reported results, we selected SNPs on the basis of the study p-value (p < 5 × 10−8 as the preferred p-value or p < 1 × 10−5 when very few SNPs reached the GWAS level of significance) and the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the corresponding SNP in the Mediterranean population (minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05). We also considered the coverage of our Illumina Human OmniExpress Array, due to the fact that no imputations were carried out in our Mediterranean population. STD1 was undertaken by Hughes et al. [45] in Germany. The authors analyzed fecal-derived 16S rRNA gene sequences and host genotype data from the Flemish Gut Flora Project (n = 2223) and two German cohorts (FoCus, n = 950, PopGen n = 717), and identified Mi-RSNPs involving multiple microbial traits.

12,methods12," Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Analysis for Microbiome Effects on Fasting Glucose  For the two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, we used, as population 1 (for the association between the instrumental variables and the exposure), the summary-level data obtained in the mbGWAS undertaken in 5959 participants from the FINRISK study [51] (STD3). Taxonomic profiling in the FINRISK study was performed according to the taxonomic nomenclature updated in the Genome Taxonomy Database (Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB)) release 89, and gut microbial composition was represented as the relative abundance of taxa. For each metagenome at phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species level, the relative abundance was computed as the proportion of reads assigned to the clade among the total reads [51]. The second sample was our Mediterranean population, and we tested the association between the instrumental variables and the outcome (plasma fasting glucose; expressed in mg/dL per allele).",191c253d-a7f7-477c-8bc3-fb80e4744217
13,methods13," Population 1 was selected because information related to the effect allele, regression coefficient (beta estimations per effective allele), and SE were uniformly presented in tables. In addition, the authors used the Human OmniExpress array for genotyping, as we did in our Mediterranean population. No information from the other studies was combined in the Mendelian randomization approach to minimize the population heterogeneity bias and the methodological differences in the coefficient estimations. We selected the Mi-RSNPs as instrumental variables from Table S1 on the basis of the strength of the association (p-value and F statistics) between the Mi-RSNPs and the microbiome trait in population 1, as well as those top ranked in population 2 (excluding SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.1 in population 2), excluding previously reported pleiotropic SNPs [66].",61145553-7485-44a0-b4cc-7ff3390ac415
14,methods14," Exposure and outcome were harmonized to ensure that both datasets were identically coded regarding the effect allele to reduce issues with palindromic variants. First, the effect allele and the corresponding beta were oriented to the risk-increasing alleles in dataset1 corresponding to the exposure (microbiome). Then, the same allele was considered to compute the beta corresponding to the outcome in dataset2 [67]. Different Mendelian randomization methods were used to estimate the so-called “causal” effect: the simple median [68], the weighted median [69], the inverse variance weighted method (inverse variance weighted method (IVW)) [70], and the Mendelian randomization Egger method (MR-Egger) [71,72]. Additionally, robust methods in Mendelian randomization via penalization of heterogeneous causal estimates were computed [73]. Heterogeneity statistics and sensitivity analyses were performed.

General Characteristics of the Participants  The demographic, anthropometric, clinical, biochemical, and lifestyle characteristics of the study participants at baseline are presented in Table 1. We analyzed 1020 subjects (371 men and 649 women). They consisted of elderly men and women from a Mediterranean population (mean age 67.9 ± 0.2 years) at a high cardiovascular risk.  body mass index (BMI) was high (mean 30.6 ± 0.2 kg/m2), with differences per sex. Prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 46.5%, being higher in men than in women (p < 0.05). Diabetes medications included insulin analogs (15%) and oral glucose-lowering drugs. Mean adherence to the Mediterranean diet according to the P-14 scale was 8.5 ± 0.1 points.

First, we fitted a crude model (model 1), and we later sequentially adjusted for additional covariates (sex, age, type 2 diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes medication). We observed a high consistency in the top-ranked SNPs across the different models. Table 2 shows the associations (regression coefficient and p-values) between the selected Mi-RSNPs and fasting plasma glucose in the whole population (n = 1020) for the most significant SNPs (top-ranked) in a model adjusted for sex, age, type 2 diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes medication.",1c79ecd2-4f21-4510-8d2a-434a5a52a925

The hit was the Mi-RSNP rs9569095 located at LOC105370213, in chromosome 13. This gene is a still uncharacterized RNA gene and is affiliated with the noncoding (nc) RNA class. The SNP was reported in STD1 (45) to be associated with class Gammaproteobacteria_HB. In our Mediterranean population, we found that the minor allele of this SNP was associated with less fasting glucose (p = 0.00099). The other hits at p < 0.01 were Mi-RSNPs previously related to the order Rhizobiales and the genus Rumminococcus torques group. Lastly, we detected at p = 0.0363 the Mi-RSNP rs10752747 in the membrane metalloendopeptidase like 1 (MMEL1) gene, previously related to abundance of the genus Tyzzerella (subgroup 3).",7d45393b-3392-48ae-893b-c9a34f4042e9
18,methods18," Considering the potential interest for subsequent meta-analysis, in Table S2, we present the results for the other Mi-RSNPs not reaching a statistically significant association (from p > 1.2090 to p ≤ 0.3350) with fasting plasma glucose in the whole population.  In addition, we studied the association between the selected Mi-RSNPs and fasting plasma glucose concentrations in nondiabetic subjects (n = 546). Table S3 shows the results for the top-ranked SNPs. The hit was the rs6890044 in chromosome 5 (intergenic). This Mi-RSNP was related to Massiliomicrobiota species. The second top-ranked SNP was the rs910633, also intergenic in chromosome 1, related to the genus Faecalibacterium. Interestingly, the rs17103336 in the BTB domain-containing 16 (BTBD16) gene, a proxy for the order Rhizobiales and previously identified as top ranked for the whole population (Table 2), reached statistical significance as the third hit in nondiabetic subjects.  3.3.",e8ebd59d-48a4-4976-9dfc-ae3913ba588d

Table 3 shows the obtained results listing the top-ranked SNPs sorted in ascending order in terms of their p-value.  In the model adjusted for sex, age, and body mass index (BMI), the hit Mi-RSNP was rs17551124 (p = 0.009) intergenic in chromosome 10, a proxy for the order Rhizobiales. We also detected significant associations at the nominal p-value with the proxies for the family Desulfovibrionaceae (rs17063777; intergenic chromosome 4) and rs10091895 in the CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1 (CSMD1), a proxy for the genus Romboutsia.  3.4.",7c27353e-9619-402d-90bf-cabca3c0117f
20,methods20," Interactions between the Mi-RSNPs and Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet in Determining Fasting Plasma Glucose  The mbGWASs from which the previously analyzed Mi-SNPs were obtained were carried out fundamentally in non-Mediterranean populations [43,45,46,51]. Although, in these previous GWAS, the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was not characterized, the influence of milk consumption on the effect of SNPs close to the lactase gene (lactase gene (LCT)) was reported. Therefore, we considered it interesting to explore whether the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet in our population could modulate the associations of the Mi-RSNPs on plasma fasting glucose. We considered this approach as an exploratory study due to the fact that the sample size has to be larger to better characterize gene–diet interactions.  Two levels of adherence to the Mediterranean diet were considered (low adherence and high adherence) on the basis of the P-14 scale described in Section 2.",c2c3f633-2086-48d1-9dbb-678c9c333d24
21,methods21," Table 4 shows the top-ranked Mi-SNPs ordered by the statistical significance of the interaction term between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the SNP on plasma fasting glucose.  Regression coefficients and SE for the effect in subjects with low (strata 1) and high (strata 2) adherence are presented. The most significant p-value (p = 0.006) for an Mi-RSNP and the Mediterranean diet interaction was detected with rs2716882, intergenic in chromosome 17.  This SNP is a proxy for the genus Sporacetigenium. According to this interaction, the effect of this SNP on plasma fasting glucose differed depending on the adherence to the Mediterranean diet. When adherence was low (strata 1), the minor allele was associated with increased fasting glucose (beta = 12.4 mg/dL), whereas when the adherence was high, the minor allele was not associated with such an increase (beta = −0.45 mg/dL).",57e25453-25d4-4500-be5f-0455a8eeb060
22,methods22," We also obtained statistically significant interactions with nine other Mi-RSNPs (rs16833405, rs7580217, rs6717477, rs6546314, rs7104796, rs10520163, rs7773795, rs11141878, and rs12597384) involving several genera (Acinetobacter, Desulfovibrio, Allisonella, etc.), suggesting a relevant role of the dietary pattern when analyzing the host–microbiome associations.  3.5. Interactions between the Mi-RSNPs and Sex in Determining Fasting Plasma Glucose  Another potential modifier of the association effects between the microbiota and the outcome was sex. In our study analyzing a Mediterranean population, we had the advantage of being able perform sex-specific analyses, since, instead of using summary data only, we undertook genetic studies in our population. For this reason, we had more flexibility to carry out analyses stratified by sex.",00eef380-d1dd-4830-8192-f1ead8826310

This sex–gene interaction results support a more detailed sex-specific analysis in the ongoing and future research in the field.  3.6. Mendelian Randomization Sub-Study including Multiple Mi-RSNPs in Determining Plasma Fasting Glucose  Above, we analyzed the Mi-RSNPs separately. However, the microbiota can exert its effects jointly, such that it is a combination of taxa that enhances the favorable or detrimental effects on the studied outcome.",deb4543c-4d45-42b2-868c-209b4ad5b307
25,methods25," Due to the fact that the previously selected Mi-RSNPs (Table S1) came from several studies carried out in different populations [43,45,46,51] and with different methodologies, to perform the Mendelian randomization analysis, we preferred to consider only a single mbGWAS carried out uniformly in a European population, the FINRISK study [51]. From this European population (n = 5959), we selected genetic instruments as detailed in Section 2 and obtained the instrument–exposure associations. Then, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization study [67] using our Mediterranean population as the second population (n = 1020) to test the instrument–outcome associations. We preselected the first (n = 12) top-ranked Mi-RSNPs from the FINRISK study on fasting glucose in our population and tested if these Mi-RSNPs were a good instrument according to Mendelian randomization core assumptions [52,58].",194ae516-314e-49d2-bedc-6ff5e139474c
26,methods26," The p-value for the associations between each of them with the exposure (microbial trait) was very significant (ranging from 4 × 10−8 to 8 × 10−9), and the F statistics were >10. In addition, genetic variants would be excluded if the minor allele frequency (MAF) was less than 0.1. We detected and excluded two SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.10. Therefore, the first assumption, relating to the strength of the association with the exposure, was confirmed. The second Mendelian randomization assumption was related with pleiotropy, and we excluded the MCM6 SNP, as previously reported [66]. Later, the MR-Egger regression slope was tested to confirm the absence of pleiotropy. Thus, nine Mi-RSNPs were preselected as good instrumental variables for the Mendelian randomization study with multiple instruments.",926a2307-35d2-4709-af8e-6d1206dec0a0
27,methods27," Table S5 shows the nine preselected instruments, the related microbial trait and the coefficients for the two populations after the required harmonization, as detailed in Section 2.

The slope of the lines represents the so-called “causal” association for each method indicated in the legends. Heterogeneity statistics and sensitivity analyses were performed. The MR-Egger heterogeneity test (p = 0.063) suggested some heterogeneity.  The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis (Figure 3) was performed to ascertain if the global Mendelian randomization association was influenced by a single SNP.

29,methods29," The overall analysis including all SNPs is also shown for comparison. We detected that the rs987019 SNP was an influential SNP.  This SNP was detected as a potential outlier in Figure 1, due to the fact that the association between the increases in the exposure level was associated with less fasting glucose for many SNPs, except the rs987019 SNP. This Mi-RSNP was related to increased levels of Romboutsia ilealis [51], and, although the evidence is not consistent, some studies related increased abundance of Romboutsia to an increased risk of insulin resistance and obesity [76,77]. Hence, we recalculated the “causal” effect estimate after removing the rs987019 SNP considered as an outlier. The Mendelian randomization analysis with the remaining eight instrumental variables showed statistically significant results using the simple median method (p = 0.031) and using all the inverse variance weighted method (IVW) methods: inverse variance weighted method (IVW) (p = 0.",cd02fbd9-dde0-49c0-92b0-b6b587d09e6c

The heterogeneity MR-Egger test was improved (p = 0.340), and no horizontal pleiotropy was detected (slope MR-Egger = 0.310; p = 0.888).  Figure 4 shows the so-called “causal” estimates for the association between the microbiome and fasting glucose using the eight finally selected instruments and presents estimations for the individual SNPs, as well as the global association using the IVM method. According to this estimation, an increasing number of effect alleles for these SNPs was related to a rise in the corresponding taxa abundance related to these SNPs, and this increase was associated with less fasting plasma glucose in the host (IVM method: −28.8; 95%CI: −52.4 to −5.4; p = 0.016).  4.",d60a7761-4602-4467-8c12-66d712c49ef1

Every day, new results are published on the influence of the gut microbiota, fundamentally bacterial, in different phenotypes of cardiometabolic diseases, as well as other diseases [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17].

32,methods32," However, the study of the gut microbiota is complex and requires the collection of feces from the study participants. In addition, there are different platforms and analysis methodologies that add complexity to the comparison of results [24,25,28,29]. For this reason, the possibility of using some genomic markers of the host as indicator variables of the composition of the intestinal microbiota is arousing great interest in the scientific community. However, these studies are still very preliminary and need further extension and replication in different populations.  Some studies in several species (including Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, mice, and other animals) have shown significant heritability, specific to different microbial families and genera [79].",40720479-2688-488c-9c9f-e628ea32bdfe
33,methods33," In humans, the influence of host genetics on the microbiome was less recognized in early studies; however, currently, several landmark mbGWASs have identified many human genetic variants associated with gut microbiota [41,42,43,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,80]. These variants, so-called Mi-RSNPs, could serve as valid instruments for the microbiota composition (exposure) in epidemiological studies and in formal one-sample or two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses [67]. Although other studies have examined the associations between several Mi-RNPs and different phenotypes (cardiovascular diseases, mental diseases, intestinal diseases, diabetes, etc.) using two-sample Mendelian randomization approaches [44,51,66,81,82,83,84,85,86], we used a different approach.",5a4be44f-e548-49a8-9729-806d72bc37f4
34,methods34," In our study, instead of using summary data both for population 1 (testing the instrument–exposure association) and for population 2 (testing the instrument–outcome association), we undertook a new study in population 2 and were, therefore, able to obtain novel unexplored associations between Mi-RSNPs in a Mediterranean population (in addition to those reported in the UK Biobank or in other large consortia with publicly available summary data). This is important because it is known that genetic associations may differ depending on the geographical origin on the analyzed population [87], and more studies in diverse and understudied populations, such as the Mediterranean population, are needed. In addition, having the individual-level data for obtaining more results is an important advantage when performing genetic association studies because additional gene × diet or gene × sex interactions can be analyzed [67,68,70].",fa7c4f62-9d90-4728-af2b-4becf857e97a
35,methods35,"  In our study, we focused on fasting plasma glucose and type 2 diabetes prevalence as outcomes to analyze the association between the host genetic variables previously reported to be related with gut microbiota taxa in four selected studies [43,45,46,51]. In this Mediterranean population, we observed some statistically significant associations at the nominal p-value between the selected Mi-RSNPs and fasting plasma glucose and type 2 diabetes. For fasting glucose, we analyzed the whole population, including nondiabetic subjects and type 2 diabetic subjects, adjusting for diabetes, medications, and other potential confounders such as sex, age, and body mass index (BMI). In addition, we analyzed the associations only in nondiabetic subjects. For these analyses, we first examined the Mi-RSNPs as individual instruments, and no combined instruments, such as polygenic risk scores, were tested.",ed503e1e-4e70-4e2c-950e-a75ffb4423ae
36,methods36," The reason for this analysis is based on the existence of high heterogeneity in reporting the associations across the different publications and on the difficulties involved in deriving the effect allele and the direction of the effect across the studies [46]. Although very few Mi-RSNPs reached statistically significant associations with fasting plasma glucose or diabetes in our Mediterranean population, we detected some interesting associations. The hit associated with fasting glucose in the whole population was the Mi-RSNP rs9569095 located at a still uncharacterized gene (ncRNA gene), in chromosome 13, which has been related to the class Gammaproteobacteria_HB [45]. This class has been associated with diabetes in other studies directly analyzing the microbiome [88,89,90], but the results are not consistent. The other hit for fasting plasma glucose was an Mi-RSNP related to the order Rhizobiales [43].",2a36e915-1b2d-484b-a828-a777cc35d41c
37,methods37," This order is interesting because others Mi-RSNPs related with it [43] have reached statistical significance in determining fasting glucose in nondiabetic subjects and type 2 diabetes risk in this population. There are very few studies analyzing this order with diabetes-related traits [91,92]. This order, most abundant as free-living bacteria, is interesting as some studies have revealed an important role of this order in relevant pathways such as amino-acid metabolism, energy production and conversion, and carbohydrate metabolism [93]. Previous Mendelian randomization studies analyzing the association between Mi-RSNPs and type 2 diabetes have reported inconsistent results [51,66,84]. Yang et al.",019b27b9-21d2-4c20-8cbc-cdb10a04876b
38,methods38," [66] analyzing the role of 27 genera of the human gut microbiota on type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease using Mendelian randomization, identified Acidaminococcus, Aggregatibacter, Anaerostipes, Blautia, Desulfovibrio, Dorea, and Faecalibacterium as being nominally associated with type 2 diabetes, whereas Xiang et al. [84] suggested that only Streptococcaceae was associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk in European populations after analyzing 28 gut microbiome families using a Mendelian randomization approach. This lack of consistency among the few studies analyzing the association between the Mi-RSNPs and type 2 diabetes may be due to the heterogeneity in the populations analyzed. We examined a high-cardiovascular-risk Mediterranean population, but some differences may exist when examining a healthy young population from the same Mediterranean area.",fe3f9236-f381-4a18-bdc9-55f10a2e5788
39,methods39," In addition, we detected some sex × Mi-RSNP interactions, highlighting the need to better analyze the possible differences between men and women [94]. In addition, we observed some statistically significant Mi-RSNP × diet interactions in determining plasma fasting glucose when considering adherence to Mediterranean diet. Previous studies have reported the influence of diet on the effects of some Mi-RSNPs. This has been widely reported in the association between milk intake and the MCM6 Mi-RSNPs associated with different Bifidobacterium species and abundance [46,51]. Likewise, a high-fiber diet has been associated with the effect of ABO Mi-RSNPs on the abundance of F. lactaris [46]. More studies are needed to better analyze the dietary modulation of the Mi-RSNPs. Moreover, several studies directly analyzing microbiota composition and type 2 diabetes and related traits have been published, obtaining diverse results depending on the population studied [34,35,36,37,95]. Wang et al.",8cf8d5cf-863d-4152-9a3a-30ecbe21e0d1
40,methods40," [96], in a recent investigation performed in China, constructed a healthy microbiome index (healthy microbiome index (HMI)) and examined the relationship between the healthy microbiome index (HMI) and type 2 diabetes incidence. In our study, we also examined the effect of several genetic instruments on fasting glucose using a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach [67]. Selecting instrumental variables in the case of SNPs related to the microbiota is complex because the increase in the abundance of each microbial taxa can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the microorganism. As the effects of many of the taxa are still poorly understood, it is difficult to create combined instruments as genetic proxies. We analyzed a combination of eight Mi-RSNPs associated with significantly lower plasma fasting glucose in the Mediterranean population as the abundance of the microbial species represented by the Mi-RSNPs increases.",ab474f96-7574-48b9-8c45-9c5c5ca9c214
41,methods41," Among them is the rs234545 Mi-RSNP, related with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii [51], a butyrate-producing bacteria that has been previously associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk. Additional studies focused not only on taxa SNPs but also on SNPs related to functionality are needed in different populations that also take into account sex, age, diet, and other lifestyle characteristics.  5. Conclusions  This work represents the first study carried out in a high-cardiovascular-risk Mediterranean population testing the association between Mi-RSNPs and plasma fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes. Our results identified a number of Mi-RSNPs significantly associated with fasting plasma glucose and type 2 diabetes contributing to the improvement of our understanding of the potential mechanisms driving these phenotypes.",6dc5b6ca-9bda-4f16-b0c7-ff3db213b4c2
42,methods42," Moreover, we detected some Mi-RSNP interactions with adherence to the Mediterranean diet and with sex modulating the association between the Mi-RSNPs and fasting glucose, thereby eliciting new research hypotheses to be tested in future studies.
