1,methods1," Material To prepare the sofrito sauce, we used the tomato variety “pera” (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill, c. v. Pera) because it is the traditional variety for making tomato sauce and sofrito, and moreover it has high content of polyphenols compared to other varieties [46]. They were bought from Grupo Almería (La Cañada, Almería, Spain) from the same batch and had similar diameter (57–67 mm) to avoid composition and climate variability. Olive oil certificated as Extra Virgin category (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) was kindly provided by Manuel Heredia Halcón (Cortijo De Suerte Alta, Albendin-Baena-Córdoba, Córdoba, Spain). Onions and garlic were bought from Ametller Origen to use the products from the same producer to avoid variability, since they provide high quality local products (Barcelona, Spain).  4.3.",63de3a89-f406-4082-b17c-65bbd13bc30d
2,methods2," Home-Cooking sofrito Process In order to study the incorporation of bioactive compounds in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) during the cooking process, sofrito tomato sauce was chosen as a representative model of traditional Mediterranean cuisine. The sofrito recipe was based on previous results of a study applying a full factorial design to evaluate the effect of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), onion, and garlic contents on the carotenoids in a tomato-based sofrito sauce (18). The tomato sofrito sauce that was cooked in triplicate using 100g of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), 400g of onion, 40g of garlic, and 460g of tomato is the formulation that showed higher content of carotenoids (18).  The tomato-based sofrito was prepared at the Food and Nutrition Torribera Campus, University of Barcelona (Santa Coloma de Gramenet, Spain).",17beec14-dd13-4987-ac49-8966100bb4d9
3,methods3," Tomatoes, garlic, and onion were washed, tomato and onions were cut into small pieces (approximately 5mm), garlic were mixed in a blender (R5 Plus, Robot Coupe®, Montceau, Bourgogne, France) and weighed. The bioactive compounds of the ingredients were analyzed after the cutting process to avoid the effect of the process. The sofrito cooking process was according to traditional Mediterranean cuisine: in an uncovered pan (24 cm diameter, 15 cm height, 6.3 L volume, 1.59 mm thicknesss, and made of inox 18/10, Paderno, Orfengo, Italy), the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was heated on an electrical cooking plate (180 mm diameter, 1500 W, model Encimera EM/30 2P, Teka®, Madrid, Spain) using a potency of 4 (of a range from 1 to 6) for 1 min. After that, the onion and garlic were added and fried for 1 min, and then the tomato was added.",8f1acdcc-b377-4969-9a0f-c51be003b332
4,methods4," From this point the cooking process was timed and the potency was reduced to 2 for low heat cooking following the traditional Mediterranean cuisine and continued for 30 min. The cooking heat was monitored and kept constant throughout the process (100 ± 1 °C) for reproducibility of the samples. After the cooking process, the sofrito samples were weighed to quantify the water loss, packaged in plastic vacuum bags, and stored at −25 °C (18).  4.4. Isolation of Oil, Water and Insoluble Fractions In order to isolate the oil, water, and insoluble fractions from the sofrito sauce, 20 g of sample was weighed in 50 mL falcon tubes and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 15 °C, according to the protocol of Palmero et al. (2013) [47].",da50d684-7138-43f2-bf18-2ee52744a361
5,methods5," After the separation of the oil fraction, which consisted of the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) added to the formulation, the water fraction, and the insoluble fraction, the different parts were weighed to verify how much each one contributed to the sofrito composition.  4.5. Extraction and Analysis of Polyphenols 4.5.1. Polyphenol Extraction The solid fraction and ingredients used before cooking (0.5 g) were extracted with 5 mL of methanol:ultra-pure water (80:20, v/v) with 0.1% of formic acid for 1 min, sonicated for 10 min in an ice bath, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C (Sigma 1-16KL, Sigma, Osterode am Harz, Germany). The supernatant was transferred into a tube and the extraction was repeated. After that, the supernatants were combined and evaporated using a vacuum evaporator (miVac DNA concentrator, Genevac LTD, Warminster, England). The residue was suspended in up to 2 mL of ultra-pure water with 0.1% of formic acid [7].",2c4ca10c-7886-49f1-943b-781e5463822b
6,methods6,"  The oil fraction (1 g) was diluted with 1 mL of n-hexane and after the addition of 2 mL of methanol, it was homogenized and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. The nonpolar and polar phases were separated and extracted again with 1 mL of n-hexane and 2 mL of methanol, respectively. The polar phases were combined, cleaned up with 50 mg of C18 to remove the polar fatty acids, homogenized for 1 min and centrifuged. In order to check for the presence of residual lipids, the extract was placed in an ultra-freezer for 15 min and a visual inspection was performed. The clean liquid was evaporated until dryness using a vacuum evaporator and the residue was suspended in up to 2 mL of ultra-pure water with 0.1% of formic acid [48].  The water fraction (1 g) was weighed and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C.

12,methods12," The carotenoids were transferred to 2 mL of hexane and washed 4 times with 5 mL of ultrapure water to remove the acetone. The hexane was evaporated until dryness using a vacuum concentrator and the residue was suspended in 1 mL of methyl tert butyl ether (MTBE), filtered with a 0.22 µm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter in a 2 mL amber vial, and stored at −80 °C.  4.6.2. Carotenoid Analysis by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-APCI-QqQ-MS/MS The carotenoid analysis was based on the procedure of Vallverdú-Queralt et al. (2015) [36] with modifications. An HPLC system (HP1100 HPLC system, Hewlett-Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a quaternary pump and autosampler and coupled with a diode array detector (DAD G1315B) was used. Separation was carried out using a C30 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm column (YMCTM, Water Co., Milford, MA, USA), with a flow rate of 600 μL/min at 25 °C. The injection volume was 20 μL. The mobile phase consisted of methanol (A), methyl tert butyl ether (MTBE) (B) and water (C).",8668f55f-6147-4f96-8381-0a0beb3ef88f

Water was kept constant at 4% throughout the analysis. The DAD detector was applied in the range of 350 to 600 nm and the chromatograms were acquired at a 450 nm wavelength.  A QTRAP4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA) equipped with an APCI ionization source operating in positive-ion and multiple reaction monitoring mode was used to confirm the identification. The carotenoids were separated using the same column and a different mobile phase was applied: methanol (A) and methyl tert butyl ether (MTBE):methanol (80:20, v/v) (B), both fortified with 0.7 g/L of ammonium acetate and 0.1% acetic acid. The linear gradient of A was: 0 min, 90%; 10 min, 75%; 20 min, 50%; 25 min, 30%; 35 min, 10%; 37 min, 6%; 39 min, 90%; and 50 min, 90%, with a flow rate of 600 μL/min.",299ff20f-3e07-4e20-b228-8adbd9b8e2f1
14,methods14," The mass spectrometer conditions were: entrance potential (EP), 10 V; collision cell exit potential (cell exit potential (CXP)), 15 V; temperature source, 400 °C, curtain gas, 20 psi, ion source gas 1 (GS1), 45 psi; ion source gas 2 (GS2), 0 psi. Declustering potential (DP) was selected for the carotenoids according to previously established conditions [51].  The identification was based on retention time, chromatography with standards, mass spectra, and UV/VIS absorption spectra: λmax, spectral fine structure (%III/II) and peak cis intensity (%Ab/AII). The carotenoids were quantified by HPLC-DAD with external calibration curves of α-carotene, β-carotene and lycopene with seven concentration levels. The limit of quantification (LoQ) was 0.2 for lycopene and 0.4 ppm for α-carotene and β-carotene. The Z-isomers were quantified with the calibration curve of the corresponding E-form. The results were expressed as µg/g of fraction.  4.7.",1b294bfa-189a-47bf-8414-d95d200b7a29
15,methods15," Statistical Analysis The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to check data normality. The statistical differences between extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) before and after cooking were analyzed by R v 3.4.4 using the t-test, and the differences between different fractions and tomato sofrito sauce by Dunn’s Kruskal–Wallis multiple comparisons.  5. Conclusions The use of olive oil in Mediterranean cuisine may improve the extractability of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and carotenoids from food matrix. The migration of polyphenols, such as naringenin, ferulic acid, and quercetin, which are compounds not detected in olive oil, to the oil fraction during the sofrito preparation may enhance their bioacessibility and bioavailability. Carotenoids from tomato can also be transferred to the oil fraction, especially Z-isomers, due to their structure and solubility, and this could improve their bioacessibility.",a4ebab3a-2d9d-41cc-b651-6da98efc67b0
16,methods16," The presence of these compounds in oil fraction after the cooking process indicates their stability in oil matrix avoiding oxidation. The beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet may be due not only to the consumption of certain foods, but also cooking techniques such as sofrito, which can help the extraction of carotenoids and phenolic compounds from food matrix, and could contribute to its bioacessibility, bioavailability, and health effects.
