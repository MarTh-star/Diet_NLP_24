0,methods0,"4.1. Reagents and Chemicals All the reagents and chemicals were purchased, at analytical grade, from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy). HPLC and LC-MS grade solvents used were purchased from Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy). HTyr, Tyr, oleacein and oleocanthal analytical standards were purchased from Sigma-Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (Olea Europea L., Coratina cultivar) was obtained from Puglia region (Italy).  4.2. UPLC-DAD/MS UPLC-DAD/MS was performed on a Waters Acquity H-Class UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), including a quaternary solvent manager (quaternary solvent manager (QSM)), a sample manager with a flow through needle system (flow through needle system (FTN)), a photodiode array detector (photodiode array detector (PDA)) and a single-quadruple mass detector with electrospray ionization source (ACQUITY QDa). Chromatography was performed on a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 2.6 μm particle size). Solvent A was 0.",b6a35682-22c6-4647-8a23-f8e557938a70
1,methods1,"1% aqueous HCOOH and solvent B was 0.1% HCOOH in MeOH. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and column temperature was set at 35 °C. Elution was performed isocratically for the first minute with 2% B; from minute 1 to minute 6 solvent B was linearly increased to 55%; from 6 to 10 min 20% A and 80% B; then, for 0.5 min solvent B was set at 100% and maintained for 2 min. The column was re-equilibrated with 98% A and 2% B before the next injection. Samples were diluted in the mobile phase and injected through the needle. The photodiode array detector (PDA) detector was set up in the range 200 to 600 nm. Mass spectrometric detection was performed in the negative electrospray ionization mode, using nitrogen as the nebulizer gas. Analyses were performed in the Total Ion Current (Total Ion Current (TIC)) mode with a mass range of 50–1000 m/z. The capillary voltage was 0.8 kV, cone voltage 15 V, ion source temperature 120 °C and probe temperature 600 °C.",e5e91b37-4b50-4f1e-8303-bb7401bacd3b
2,methods2," Quantification of each compound was performed by using standards calibration curves in the range of 0.1–2 nmol in the column.  4.3. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) Extraction and Compounds Isolation NaDeep eutectic solvents (DES) choline:glycerol (1:1.5 molar ratio) was prepared by mixing the two components at 60 °C under magnetic stirring for 1 h. After cooling Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was added to the NaDeep eutectic solvents (DES) in the ratio 1:20 w/w (NaDeep eutectic solvents (DES):Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)). The extractions were carried out under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 15 min and then transferred via a separatory funnel for decantation and phases separation. The same procedure was repeated 3 times to evaluate the recovery of single compounds after each extraction. After UPLC quantification of the phenolic and secoridoid components, the second and the third extractions were pooled together and these new extracts were each added in a ratio of 1.",62949752-623c-437a-8825-3e28ba5cdc8a

Preparative chromatography was performed on a Waters HPLC 600 pump equipped with a controller and an UV-Vis photodiode array detector mod. 2996. The chromatographic column was a reverse phase Vydac C18 column, 22 mm × 250 mm, 10 μm particle size. Data analysis was monitored using a dedicated application (Millennium32). Elution was performed at 8 mL/min with a binary gradient system with bidistilled water (solvent A) and 80% aqueous ethanol (solvent B). The gradient was: 0–5 min, 2% B; 5–35 min, 100% B. During the separation the products were monitored spectrophotometrically at 280 nm and directly collected from the detector. After compound collection the solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator, and finally dried by freeze-drying.  5.",64e89e27-4fdb-4399-87cf-ee77d9c3e8f6
4,methods4," Conclusions This work demonstrates the possibility of using a convenient, rapid and totally green novel methodology for the purification of HTyr, Tyr, oleacein and oleocanthal from Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) by direct NaDeep eutectic solvents (DES) extraction, obtaining highly concentrated solutions of phenols and secoiridoids. These solutions possess several advantages with respect to classical organic extracts, especially for reverse phase preparative HPLC applications. The hydrophilic nature of NaDeep eutectic solvents (DES) allows its injection at large volumes into the starting reverse phase gradients, with no influence on the resolution and selectivity of the chromatography.",a2da99ca-9de1-49a2-addf-c83603734d5f
5,methods5," As mentioned above, the present method, with respect to the currently available procedures, represents a completely green alternative for the isolation of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) phenolics and secoiridoids, which provides the total recovery of the compounds and prevents degradation processes caused by extensive organic extractions and different separation steps. Moreover, besides being an eco-friendly process, the proposed purification is even economically sustainable compared to traditional methods, in which large amounts of organic solvents are utilized and low yields and purities of the compounds are obtained. Due to the high costs and the pharmacological potential that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) phenols, and especially secoiridoids such as oleocanthal, display, the present method will represent a new solution for scientists who want to further investigate the chemical and biological properties of these natural products, of which there is still much to explore.
