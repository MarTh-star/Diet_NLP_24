25,discussion0," Herbs are viewed to be of high value to the health of individuals and communities in general. The medicinal benefit of plants lies in some chemical substances which have specific physiological effects on the human body (33). The water extract of lemon and ginger combination showed potent antiproliferative activity against the MCF-7, MDA-MB231, HCT-116, A549, EMT-6/P, and Vero (normal cells) cell lines (Table 1).  No previous studies have examined the antiproliferation activity of the lemon and ginger combination water extract on the aforementioned cell lines. However, many studies have investigated the antiproliferation activity of each extract against selected cell lines.  Lemon has shown the presence of different indolofuroquinoxaline derivatives, which exhibited antiproliferative activity against leukemia and human breast cancer cells. On the other hand, there was no significant activity against the normal cell line (34).",2cb4180e-b750-4622-a92a-08dfba319105
26,discussion1,"  Meanwhile, ginger has been reported to have a cytotoxic effect against human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231). The ability of ginger to inhibit cell growth was due to the presence of [6]-gingerol as it hindered the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (matrix metalloproteinases (MMP))-2 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 in the human breast cancer cells (35).  The lemon and ginger combination water extract revealed synergic effect in reducing cancer cells proliferation in vitro. This finding is compatible with a previous study, which reported the ability of lemon and garlic water extract to induce apoptosis and prevent carcinoma development (BR35A,). However, the potent anticancer response of the lemon and ginger combination water extract was observed to be mediated by diverse anticancer mechanisms, which may be explained by the existence of various phytochemicals compounds.",55298d0e-e269-4abc-87b8-24f1c2b791bb
27,discussion2," The observed proliferation inhibition in the cells treated with the lemon and ginger combination water extract is basically because of the impact of different antiproliferation factors. Alpha-pinene was detected in lemon and ginger combination utilizing GC/MS with a percentage value of 11.5%.  The cytotoxic potential of alpha-pinene was examined in two different human cell lines (human ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3 and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells Bel-7402) (37). Also, it was studied against the human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cell line (38). Furthermore, a previous study confirmed that alpha-pinene has an antiproliferation effect through provoking oxidative stress and associated signaling cascade against human lung cancer (A549) and human liver cancer (HepG2) (39). These previous findings are consistent with this study. On the other hand, α-pinene was found to have no antiproliferation activity against melanoma cells in vitro (40).",ec23d5aa-0903-45e2-9dee-314a9cac4360
28,discussion3," This may be justified by the fact that solid tumors have different responses to phytochemicals as α-pinene.  Other highly concentrated compounds in the combination extract are alpha-terpineol (7.5%) and terpinen-4-ol (5.4%).  Alpha-terpineol has demonstrated antioxidant ability against peroxyl radicals and has been shown to have a cytostatic impact against six human cancerous cell lines from five diverse histologic and embryonic origins (breast, lung, prostate, ovarian, and leukemia) (41). Furthermore, terpinen-4-ol was found in the combination extract to a significant degree. It caused necrotic cell death coupled with less activity of apoptosis process in both murine malignant mesothelioma cell line AE17 and murine B16 melanoma cells. The inhibitory impact of terpinen-4-ol is achieved through the elicitation of the G1 cell cycle arrest (42).",79f8fd97-38ee-4ef6-bda4-5463d44aa71a
29,discussion4,"  Further analysis of the lemon and ginger combination water extract revealed the presence of geraniol, citral, δ-elemene, camphene, and borneol in notable percentages and the previously reported activity of these components confirms the results of this study.  Based on a previous study, the growth of prostate cancer cells was inhibited by the effect of geraniol compound on inducing the apoptosis and autophagy process (43). Citral prevents the proliferation of breast cancer cells (MDA MB-231 cells) in vitro, mainly through the initiation of apoptosis, antimetastasis, and antiangiogenesis potentials (44). In colorectal adenocarcinoma (DLD-1), the antiproliferative activity of δ-elemene was implemented by the activation of mitochondrial caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways (45). On the other hand, camphene exhibited anticancer activity in melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. It can disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential and enhances the caspase-3 effect (46).",11c7d67f-01d5-43b4-9e96-e43d6f4b7ea3
30,discussion5," In a previous study, borneol (NB) improved the absorption of selenocysteine; as a result, it increased his apoptotic activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Also, they reduced tumor growth by provoking ROS-mediated DNA damage (47).  In the current study, the potential inhibition of cancer cell growth by lemon and ginger combination may due to the effects of the nine major compounds previously mentioned and to the other active minor components.  To gain further in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms of action of the combination extract under study, the lemon and ginger combination was further tested for its ability to inhibit angiogenesis. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent signal protein that stimulates angiogenesis. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) upregulation is a well-known mechanism in many types of tumors and the inhibition of this pathway is an interesting target in cancer prevention and therapy (48).",77e72fd1-a088-4e99-ad89-1d1101aaeec4
31,discussion6," In our study, the lemon and ginger combination showed a strong ability to suppress the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer angiogenesis.  Further examination showed that the lemon and ginger combination water extract had a potent anticancer effect in vitro. The combination has potent apoptosis induction activity and potent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition in the MDA-MB231 cell line.  In MDA-MB-231 cells, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is involved in the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA then increases the angiogenesis (49). The activations of NF-κB were attenuated utilizing α-pinene treatment (50). In HeLa cells, alpha-terpineol repressed TNF-α and NF-kB translocation into the cell nucleus. Repression of NF-kB activation can result in the decrease of cyclin D expression, an essential protein in the induction of the G phase of the cell cycle (51). Meanwhile, geraniol is a strong agent with antiangiogenic properties (52).",6329a422-817d-44a3-a4d3-2db211b449ab
32,discussion7," These results are inconsistent with the findings of this study.  Another mechanism responsible for the observed anticancer activity is apoptosis (programmed cell death) induction. In cancer, this process is inoperative, due to the upregulation of antiapoptotic genes and the downregulation of apoptotic genes; therefore, cells continue dividing and proliferating (53). One of the targeted pathways in cancer treatment is the activation of apoptosis.  In our study, the lemon and ginger combination herbal drink was found to have the ability to induce apoptosis in the MDA-MB231 cell line (4.4 times greater than that of the negative control).  Both hesperidin (flavonoid) (54), and eriocitrin (flavonoid) (55) in lemon cause apoptosis induction and inhibit the human hepatocellular carcinoma.",7a8ef092-6f29-4588-9d2f-b48c4bfb87c0
33,discussion8," The high antiproliferative activity of lemon has been explained in previous studies, which have shown that the methanol extract of lemon has anticancer activity toward MCF-7 breast cancer cells via Bax-related caspase-3 activation. Meanwhile, the ethanol extract of lemon peel exhibited a weak cytotoxic effect (IC50 > 500 μg/ml) against human leukemia HL-60 cells (56). Alpha-pinene, which is found in high percentages in the lemon and ginger combination, was also capable of inducing apoptosis, as evidenced by the rise in caspase-3 activity (57). Moreover, geraniol has the most dominant apoptosis-inducing activity among terpenoids against shoot primordia of Matricaria chamomilla; it causes DNA fragmentation in the cells. The activity of geraniol is concentration- and time-dependent (58). These results correspond with this study’s conclusion.",a007684b-e4e1-4eb1-b86a-66199d93e68f
34,discussion9,"  The immune system is a sophisticated defense system in vertebrates, having the role of protecting them from numerous types of foreign infectious agents that they encounter during their lifetimes. It uses a variety of cells, tissues, and organs and is capable of recognizing and eliminating invasions (59). There has been a growing interest in identifying and characterizing natural compounds with immunomodulatory activities. Three immune assays have been conducted, namely, lymphocytes proliferation, phagocytosis, and pinocytosis assays.  Lymphocytes proliferation assay was conducted three times: splenic lymphocytes with extract alone, splenic lymphocytes with extract and Con A, and splenic lymphocytes with extract and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), for lemon and ginger combination water extract.",937df491-ad85-4144-b415-9467a77e1fa7
35,discussion10,"  Lemon and Ginger Combination Water Extract Had a Limited Effect on Lymphocyte Proliferation and Phagocytosis Activity  The volatile oil of ginger exhibited significant suppression of the mitogen-stimulated T-lymphocyte proliferation in mice (60), which agrees with our result. While citrus peels had a mitogenic response to con A (56). In addition to that, both lemon citrus and ginger stimulate innate immunity (61, 62). These previous studies conflicted with our results may be due to the antagonistic effect of the combination on the activity of both lemon and ginger.  For pinocytic activity, the potent pinocytic activity was the lemon and ginger combination. Various groups of phytochemicals are found in the lemon and ginger combination water extract. This could explain the activation of a specific anticancer response, such as immune enhancement It is worth mentioning that a-pinene exhibited anti-Leishmania activity via macrophage stimulation with minimum cytotoxicity (63).",fa865735-93da-46b5-ab64-7b9c900a73c5
36,discussion11," Citral influences cytokines production by activation of murine macrophages through the prevention of the transcription factor NF-κB (64). In the cell-based assay, terpinen-4-ol was able to modulate apoptosis and immune system activity in a way that reduced the cell growth of melanoma cells (65). In agreement with these previous studies, the results of this study showed that the lemon and ginger extract possesses strong antiproliferation and pinocytosis activity.  An in vivo study was conducted to evaluate the activity of lemon and ginger combination water extract on the EMT-6/P cell line implanted in Balb/C mice. This study results showed a significant reduction in tumor sizes in all treated mice. On the other hand, no previous study has examined the in vivo tumor-prevention activity of lemon and ginger combination water extract.  Besides cancer chemotherapy strategies, using dietary agents such as fruits and vegetables help the prevention of tumor growth.",da1b6562-6942-44fa-953a-1a2e4c2c2ae1
37,discussion12," Extracts derived from fruits and vegetables are demonstrated to have antiproliferative effects (18). It is extensively acknowledged that chemopreventive agents, as lifestyle and dietary habits, have more superior potential in the long term than chemotherapeutic agents, especially in prostate cancer growth and progression (65).  In vivo, the lemon and ginger combination water extract induced a significant decrease in percentage change in tumor size, a high percentage of mice with no detectable tumor, and low average tumor weight (g) (Table 2).  A cohort study confirms that the daily consumption of citrus fruits is associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer (18). Notably, daily oral feeding of 100 mg/kg of whole ginger water extract prevented both the growth and progression of the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 xenografts by approximately 56% in nude mice (66). The lemon and ginger combination is mostly composed of alpha-pinene, according to GC-MS/MS analysis.",2e62f45b-e76a-4861-9111-d85ad4a21b1e
38,discussion13," In vivo, alpha-pinene pretreatment reduced the production of the pancreatic tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 during the induction of acute pancreatitis by cerulean (67). Another previous study found that the tumor volumes from mice treated with α-pinene were around 40% less than those from the mice in the control group (68). There is an interaction between the work of lemon and ginger combination resulted in antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the anticancer activity could be explained by the stimulation of apoptosis and pinocytosis and reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression.  Conclusion  Lemon and ginger herbal combination is a healthy drink with anticancer and immunomodulatory health benefits. Its anticancer effect is mediated by apoptosis induction and angiogenesis inhibition. The immunomodulatory effect is mediated through the activation of the innate immune system.",b04d8727-0085-4a1f-9b65-4b6f8cf655e6
