0,background0," Lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity, obesity and hypercaloric nutrition have been shown to substantially impact breast cancer (BC) risk [1–7]. To what extent modifiable lifestyle factors affect cancer risk in women genetically at high risk of developing BC, such as carriers of a germline mutation in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (gBRCA1/2) has been far less widely researched. Of note is that the penetrance of certain inherited BRCA1 mutations has been increasing 24% to 67% as generations proceed [8–10]. Amongst other reasons this increase might be attributed to an alteration of the social and lifestyle environment [8, 11].",b0879152-8007-452d-8678-c5e74a286b80
1,background1,"  In light of this the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 trial, a prospective lifestyle-intervention randomized controlled trial, was initiated to investigate whether a structured 1-year intervention program ameliorates cardiopulmonary fitness, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and the nutritional pattern in female gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers [12–14]. Additionally, the identification of lifestyle-related biomarkers for molecular mechanisms that are involved in tumorigenesis in gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers is important and therefore certain promising biomarkers were measured in the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 trial. Two of these, which are the focus of this work: neurotensin (NT) and enkephalin (enkephalin (ENK)) have been identified as markers linking cardiovascular, cardiometabolic and cancer risk.",0ca3edd3-6f6c-4ee9-aab0-f24b2e570999
2,background2,"  Neurotensin/pro-neurotensin (pro-NT)  Neurotensin (NT) is a 13-amino acid peptide, which is mainly found in the central nervous system and in the small intestine. It behaves as a neuromodulator in the brain by regulating the anorectic effect and is an important factor in nutrient metabolism, particularly through lipid ingestion and fat storage [15–19]. Clinical studies indicate that increased levels of peripheral NT occur in obesity and are directly linked to features of insulin resistance in humans [17, 19–21]. Within the Framingham Heart Study, NT was associated with incident major cardiovascular events, independently of traditional cardiovascular risk factors [22]. Melander et al. conducted a large cohort study, which confirmed a contribution of NT to obesity-derived diseases such as cardiovascular and in particular BC [21]. Recently, Li and colleagues were able to demonstrate a protection from obesity in NT-deficient mice fed with a high-fat diet [17].",a99edd07-c179-4731-8604-45f1a53f4996
3,background3,"  Enkephalin/pro-enkephalin (pro-enkephalin (ENK))  As part of the endogenous opioid peptide system, Methionine-enkephalin (ENK) (Metenkephalin (ENK)), is deemed to be of considerable importance in tumorigenesis by averting tumor cell proliferation [23–27]. Within the framework of two Swedish cohort studies, fasting plasma of 3498 non-diseased women was examined to quantify pro-enkephalin (ENK), the stable precursor of enkephalin (ENK), and predict its impact on BC risk [28]. After a median follow-up of 14.7 years, women with pro-enkephalin (ENK) values in the lowest quartile were found to be three to five times more susceptible to BC than women with pro-enkephalin (ENK) values in the highest quartile [28, 29]. Intriguingly, more recent findings indicate a favourable effect of Metenkephalin (ENK) concerning obesity and its related diseases [30]. Cardiovascular function has also been found to be affected by this biomarker and seems to be modulated by physical activity [31–35].",9d56c236-5a32-4972-a999-f89ffac768a6
4,background4,"  Within an experimental study, the effect of weekly moderate-intensity exercise training on the activation of the cardiac opioid system of a diet-induced obesity model in rats was compared [36]. While sedentary animals fed with a high fat diet presented lower cardiac pro-enkephalin (ENK) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels, a level-dependent activation of the cardiac opioid system was seen in the active group [36]. This could be relevant in the context of our study, as there is emerging evidence on an association between BRCA1/2 deficiency and various cardiovascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease [37]. Certainly, premature menopause as a consequence of prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (prophylactic bilateral salpingo oophorectomy (PBSO)) and /or potential cardiotoxic effects of cancer treatment (chemotherapy/radiotherapy in case of breast cancer) may have a decisive impact.",929fdd81-1acc-4ec7-80fa-4f28dd439fab
5,background5," Recently, a causal part for the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 in cardiovascular diseases was described [37]. The role of these two genes as gatekeepers in cardiac function and structure can increase susceptibility to cardiac damage when their function is compromised [38].  We, therefore, wanted to answer two specific questions: i) whether gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers differ from women of the general population, that are not indicative for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer regarding plasma concentration of NT and enkephalin (ENK), ii) what is the effect of a 1-year lifestyle-intervention on NT and enkephalin (ENK) plasma levels in gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

6,methods0," Study cohorts and patient recruitment  The lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 trial is the feasibility phase of a multicenter, prospective, two-armed, randomized (1:1) and controlled lifestyle-intervention trial that enrolled 68 women with and without a previous BC or ovarian cancer (OC), aged 18–72 years, with a germline mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. From February to July 2014, study participants were recruited at three of the study centres of the German Consortium of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (www.konsortium-familiaerer-brustkrebs.de), Cologne, Kiel and Munich. The study protocol has been published in detail elsewhere [12, 13]. The lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 trial was approved by the ethics committee of all participating centres and written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to study entry (SE, baseline).",a6433134-0922-417f-a7f8-da149dbdd25b
7,methods1,"  In order to answer our first question, we also used data from a cohort of the general population including female subjects with and without previous cancer disease, which were involved in a cross-sectional study (OMA-reference). The OMA study had previously been conducted at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of the Technical University Munich and the Red Cross Women´s hospital in Munich and enrolled 204 BC patients, 28 OC patients and 68 control subjects without previous or current cancer [16, 29] (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Schematic overview of the study population and baseline analysis.",297388e8-d888-4c62-a9d0-b752b6a1a2cd

For OMA-reference pro-NT and pro-enkephalin (ENK) fasting plasma levels were measured just once at SE, while this was done at SE as well as subsequent time points [plus 3 months (V1) and plus 12 months (V2)] for lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1-total. The plasma aliquots of lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1-total as well as OMA-reference were immediately frozen after separation and stored at − 80 °C.",b271096a-83ef-498a-881a-3dbe54d2db71
10,methods4,"  Pro-neurotensin (pro-NT)  Chemiluminometric sandwich immunoassay was applied to quantify the pro-NT precursor fragment (proNT 1–117), a stable fragment of the NT precursor hormone (SphingoTec GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany) [21]. The assay was modified using two mouse monoclonal antibodies against pro-NT 8-25 and pro-NT 44-62, native human pro-NT diluted in horse serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany, Munich) for calibration and detecting signals in a microplate luminometer. The functional assay sensitivity was 3 pmol/L, defined as the lowest measurement value detectable with a precision of maximum 20% inter-assay coefficient of variance (CV). The mean inter-assay CV was 3.7% in the measuring range 3–270 pmol/L.  Pro-enkephalin A 119–159 (pro-enkephalin (ENK))  Pro-enkephalin (ENK) was quantified using a similar microtiter plate-based sandwich immunoassay approach (SphingoTec GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany), which has been published previously [40].",d4a138e8-ba5d-4cd2-9a12-4dda8d3a4c4d
11,methods5," Two mouse monoclonal anti-pro-enkephalin (ENK) antibodies were developed by immunizing mice with pro-enkephalin (ENK) peptide consisting of amino acids 119–159 of pro-enkephalin (ENK) [40]. The detection limit was stated to be 7 pmol/L and the mean inter-assay CV yielded 5.7% in the measuring range 10.9–686.3 pmol/L.  Lifestyle-intervention  We considered the effects of the 1-year lifestyle-intervention on plasma levels of pro-NT and pro-enkephalin (ENK) in lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1-total only, as OMA-reference only had one measurement available (Fig. 2).Fig. 2 Schematic overview of second analysis: effects of the 1-year lifestyle-intervention on plasma levels of pro-NT and pro-enkephalin (ENK) in lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1-total.",3224253a-2662-4f7d-8e1f-6b53e39b63fa

The principal aspects of the MedD encompass high consumption of olive oil, legumes, unrefined cereals, fruits and vegetables, moderate consumption of seafood and dairy products, and reduced intake of meat products and sweets [41, 42]. The intervention group (IG) received structured and supervised training sessions within the first three months (SE to V1), considered as the intense phase of the intervention program, aiming a performance target of ≥ 18 MET*h/week (MET = metabolic equivalent task) [12–14].",970d74cb-6486-4d89-8918-197e0b55aed4
13,methods7," Their program also comprised regular nutritional group education on the MedD [12–14]. During the subsequent nine months (to V2), participants of the IG were encouraged to complete exercise units as home-based training thrice weekly. Group training sessions continued at monthly intervals, accompanied by regular telephone contact as motivation. Compared with this, the control group (CG) attended only one lecture on physical activity and the benefits of healthy nutrition [12–14]. To objectively assess the impact on cardiopulmonary fitness, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)) was performed at SE, V1 and V2, which measures the respiratory gases under exercise stress and thus captures maximal oxygen uptake [VO2peak (mL/min/kg)], as well as aerobic and anaerobic respiratory capacity [14].",52310459-4e9e-4521-bacf-d97189c23315
14,methods8," Target parameters were defined as VO2peak as well as VO2 at ventilatory aerobic and anaerobic thresholds to give information on the cardiopulmonary fitness level at the specified time points of the study [14, 43].  Furthermore, at each time point, a clinical examination was conducted to assess anthropometric data (age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference), medical history, social background and risk factors for carcinogenesis for all participants. Blood samples were also collected, in order to determine various blood values. To record dietary behaviour, Omega-3, Omega-6, and Omega-9 fatty acid (FA) content in the membrane of erythrocytes was assessed [44]. ",761cfed0-633e-4150-8029-27236b0ad30a

25,discussion0," We aimed to identify lifestyle-related biomarkers for molecular mechanisms that are involved in tumorigenesis in gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers. NT and enkephalin (ENK) are known to be linked with cardiovascular, cardiometabolic and cancer risk, and emerging evidence suggests direct associations with lifestyle factors [17, 19–21, 30, 33, 45]. We therefore aimed to investigate if NT and enkephalin (ENK) plasma levels might be altered by a structured lifestyle-intervention program consisting of endurance training alongside the MedD in the context of gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers, within the lifestyle-intervention trial lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 [12–14].  Initially, we wanted to know whether gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers inherently differ from women of the general population regarding NT and enkephalin (ENK) fasting plasma concentrations.",703d9a2b-fbd9-4e32-bc8a-aef77681fc14
26,discussion1," Therefore, plasma levels of the stable precursors of NT and enkephalin (ENK), pro-NT and pro-enkephalin (ENK) were analyzed in the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1-total, as well as the OMA-reference group at SE. The median pro-NT fasting plasma concentration was higher in lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1-total participants, reaching statistical significance in the comparison of lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-cancer and OMA-cancer subgroups. Higher pro-NT levels would be expected with overweight or obesity, however the median body mass index (BMI) was comparable throughout our studied subgroups [17, 19, 20, 40]. The OMA-cancer subgroup was in median older than the others, however we found age not to be significantly associated with pro-NT within uni- and multivariate analyses.",6790595d-3335-470a-94cd-5335b68eb916
27,discussion2," A large control collective from the Malmö cancer and diet (Malmö cancer and diet (MDC)) study of 1929 healthy subjects did not show a significant correlation between age and pro-NT, which points to an age-independent pro-NT activity [16]. This might point to an intrinsic disposition in the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-cancer subgroup given that pro-NT is in turn associated with elevated BC risk [21]. Discrepant results were obtained for pro-enkephalin (ENK). Participants of the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-non-cancer subgroup had lower median pro-enkephalin (ENK) plasma concentrations compared to their OMA-non-cancer peers, which may indicate an adverse risk constellation for gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers.",9e905cee-7bca-4e4e-a76c-2f5f6be51e70
28,discussion3," Yet, compared with this, the subgroup lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-cancer presented more favorable pro-enkephalin (ENK) levels than participants of OMA-cancer, a difference that was marginally statistically significant (63 pmol/L vs. 69 pmol/L, p = 0.045). Univariate analysis showed a significant age-dependency, yet this disappeared in the multivariate analysis. Intriguingly, recent findings indicate a potential age–dependent increase of pro-enkephalin (ENK) [46]. In contrast to these, the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-cancer subgroup had higher pro-enkephalin (ENK) levels compared to the OMA-cancer subgroup, who were in median 16 years older.",1ef5caf8-0f90-487d-b0f2-50d9e6b407a9
29,discussion4," This might be explained by pre-existing stronger health awareness of the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-cancer subgroup, who for instance had a better cardiopulmonary fitness level compared to the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-non-cancer subgroup at SE, reflected by higher initial levels of VO2peak (mL/min/kg). A comparison with the cardiopulmonary fitness of the OMA-cancer subgroup is however not possible as cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was not carried out in the OMA-reference study. Another influencing factor might be an endogenous compensation mechanism subsequent to cardiotoxic cancer therapy, especially when considering a possibly higher susceptibility to cardiac muscle disorder in gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers [34]. However, further research is required to answer this question.",4c7ee175-d6e5-4508-94ae-43e61c049881
30,discussion5,"  We then investigated the effect of a 1-year lifestyle-intervention on pro-NT and pro-enkephalin (ENK) plasma levels in the gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers within the lifestyle-intervention feasibility trial lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1. We saw a statistically significant inverse correlation between pro-NT plasma levels and VO2peak changes over the 1-year intervention (− 0.435; CI − 0.653 to − 0.151; p = 0.004), which also remained consistent in univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Based on previous reports from the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 trial [11, 12], which point out the over-motivation of the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 participants particularly in the CG, we consider VO2peak derived from cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to be the most objective parameter for cardiopulmonary fitness.",e3f0e26e-aa67-40e5-afc8-1499c75581bd
31,discussion6,"  Pro-enkephalin (ENK) plasma concentration was positively correlated to increasing VO2peak at the study time point SE (0.323; CI 0.061–0.544; p = 0.017), which is in agreement with corresponding studies that postulated a relationship between physical training and plasma concentration of pro-enkephalin (ENK) [47, 48]. Yet, this was not reproducible in follow-ups at V1 and V2, nor for the change through the 1-year lifestyle-intervention. Particularly, participants of lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-cancer, who had the highest pro-enkephalin (ENK) levels at SE and made up the majority of our study population, barely improved their pro-enkephalin (ENK) plasma levels.",779876d7-b8c0-4908-9996-c696c9d0698c
32,discussion7," A possible explanation might be that the impact of additional exercise sessions on proportionally elevated pro-enkephalin (ENK) levels in lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-cancer are less pronounced compared to lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-non-cancer, who were physically less active at SE, reflected by lower proenkephalin (ENK) concentration. Existing evidence indicates a trainable response regarding pro-enkephalin (ENK) concentrations [47, 48]. Kjær et al. described highest pro-enkephalin (ENK) concentrations at 54% of the VO2peak in trained endurance athletes, however with further increasing exercise intensities the pro-enkephalin (ENK) level decreased to resting concentrations [48]. Compared to this, the response patterns of untrained probands resulted in an increase in pro-enkephalin (ENK) plasma concentrations with increasing exercise intensities [48].",eb2e6e46-d9ff-4ccc-b99e-a631bb710ea2
33,discussion8," The precise mechanism and explanation remains unknown, but this may be the emergence of a type of “adrenal exhaustion” due to a potential over-stimulation of the adrenal gland, from which pro-enkephalin (ENK) is released [47].  We also built statistical models (linear regression) for pro-NT and pro-enkephalin (ENK) plasma concentrations taking into consideration physical, clinical as well as nutritional parameters. Pro-NT showed a consistent, yet non-significant inverse association with the ratio of Omega 6/Omega 3 FA (an objective assessment of dietary patterns) in uni-and multivariate analysis (Estimate: − 32.7 and − 37.9, p = 0.097 and 0.080, respectively). These results are in agreement with previous findings in the literature, where NT has been identified as an important factor in nutrient metabolism particularly through lipid ingestion and fat storage [15, 16, 18–20].",18253182-b5fa-42e4-9a4a-973386280244
34,discussion9," Increased levels of peripheral NT occur in obesity and are directly linked to features of insulin resistance in humans [17, 19–21]. Li et al. were recently able to demonstrate a protection from obesity in NT-deficient mice fed with a high-fat diet [17], our findings provide additional support that dietary intervention may contribute to a reduction in pro-NT plasma levels.  Limitations  Our study needs to be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, the study population was small, resulting in a restricted ability to draw definitive conclusions. Second, we had only one measurement of the biomarkers for the OMA-reference population. However, as a feasibility trial, lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 aimed at generating hypotheses.",9bd7008c-3238-4c51-bc08-18f38ada909f
35,discussion10," Further investigation will be conducted in the framework of the larger lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-2 trial with a sample size of more than 600 gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers.  Conclusion  Our study gives first indications that pro-NT, which is involved in tumorigenesis, cardiovascular- and obesity-related diseases, is inversely associated with improving cardiopulmonary fitness and nutritional parameters in gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Yet, the situation was discrepant for pro-enkephalin (ENK), which showed a positive correlation with VO2peak at SE, however, further training did not lead to a corresponding increase in pro-enkephalin (ENK) levels, possibly due to a type of “adrenal exhaustion”.  gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers seem to have an adverse constellation of pro-NT and to a lesser extent pro-enkephalin (ENK), possibly due to intrinsic disposition.",7de88de1-f8d1-4f05-952b-3c3ac6e00266
36,discussion11,"  Our findings support our supposition that improvements of lifestyle behavior including physical activity and dietary pattern, might constitute a strategy to reduce cancer risks, as well as mitigate cardiovascular risk in these mutation carriers.
