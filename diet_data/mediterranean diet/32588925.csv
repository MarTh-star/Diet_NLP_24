0,methods0," 2.1. Study Population  This is an ancillary study and post-hoc analysis of our previous study, which is a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of anthocyanin supplementation on lipid profiles, oxidative stress, and inflammation in hyperlipidemic patients [28,29]. To be consistent with the parent study, the current study selected hyperlipidemic patients. Study participants (n = 269 Chinese men and women, 35–65 years old, resident in Guangzhou for at least the past 10 years) were recruited from Guangzhou, China, and had hyperlipidemia (defined as comprising at least two of the following four criteria: fasting plasma concentrations of triglyceride ≥ 1.70 mmol/L, total cholesterol [TC] ≥ 5.20 mmol/L, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] ≥ 3.12 mmol/L, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C] ≤ 0.91 mmol/L) according to the “2016 Chinese Guideline for the Management of Dyslipidemia in Adults”.",761e2023-c85e-44d9-8f55-72730ba05b01
1,methods1," Exclusion criteria included known chronic diseases (including type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, untreated hypertension, cancer, and liver and kidney dysfunction); acute and chronic infectious diseases, trauma or surgery; use of hormonal therapies; use of medications known to influence lipid metabolism (including statins, fibrates, and bile acid sequestrants) within the past six months; use of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic drugs within the past three months; use of vasomotor function drugs within the past three months; taking phytochemicals (such as anthocyanins and grape seed extract) or other dietary supplements within the past two months and pregnant or lactating women [29]. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.

Sample Size Estimation  Sample size estimation was conducted using PASS 15.0 software (NCSS, Kaysville, UT, USA). The sample size was determined based on the results of a Chinese cardiovascular research study [8], which has reported that the prevalence of dyslipidemia in Chinese adults is approximately 40%. With the use of an allowable error of 0.06 (0.2-fold prevalence) and type Ⅰ error of 0.05 (2 tail), the estimated sample size was 269 participants.  2.3. Recruitment and Screening  Volunteers who were interested in the study advertisements were contacted via telephone to assess potential eligibility, and if they met inclusion criteria, were invited for an onsite visit at the School of Public Health of Sun Yat-sen University (Sun Yat sen University (SYSU)) to learn specific information about the study and attend a pre-screening test.",02574d4d-1e9d-4b03-acc6-133e73e79ac7
3,methods3," During the in-person visit, fasting venous blood samples were collected and lipid and lipoprotein profiles were measured to confirm eligibility. Volunteers were included in the study and signed informed consent forms if they qualified according to the pre-determined criteria. A total of 601 volunteers received pre-screening tests and 269 participants were enrolled into the study (see Figure S1—Online Supplementary Figure for participant flow).  2.4. Assessment of Dietary Intake Information  Dietary intake information was assessed using a validated interviewer-administered 79-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [30,31]. Participants answered two questions about each food item: their usual frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, never) of consuming specific foods or beverages over the past 1 year; and the amount of consumption at each time.",24c30b43-b32a-4c5c-9058-7d7704178ff8
4,methods4," The average daily intake of each food item was calculated by multiplying the intake frequency of each food per day by the amount consumed at each time. Nutrients from each food item were calculated based on the 2018 Chinese Food Composition Table (Standard Edition) [32].  2.5. Calculation of a Priori Dietary Indexes  dietary balance index (DBI)-16 [26], CHealthy Eating Index (HEI) [27], Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) [17] and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score [19,33] were calculated with the dietary intake information collected from food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The dietary balance index (DBI)-16 has eight food components including cereals, vegetables and fruits, beans and dairy products, animal foods, empty energy foods, condiments, diet variety, and water.",f0fcf516-ae1c-431b-a9be-5e202f199eac
5,methods5," A score of 0 is given when the food intake meets the recommendation of the dietary guidelines, and the negative or positive scores indicate that the actual intake levels are insufficient or excessive compared to the recommended levels, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). dietary balance index (DBI)-16 has four indicators of dietary quality, including total score (TS), low bound scores (low bound scores (LBS)), high bound scores (high bound scores (HBS)), and diet quality distance (diet quality distance (DQD)) [24]. dietary balance index (DBI)-TS, which ranges from −72 to 44, is calculated by summing all scores of eight food groups to reflect the overall diet quality [34]. If dietary balance index (DBI)-TS is negative, the dietary intake tends to be insufficient; and if dietary balance index (DBI)-TS is positive, the dietary intake tends to be excessive. A value of 0 of dietary balance index (DBI)-TS indicates a balanced diet, without insufficient or excessive intakes.",befc640b-d788-4f0f-bc13-5f04747b8a1e
6,methods6," dietary balance index (DBI)-low bound scores (LBS) is the sum of absolute values of negative scores, indicating the degree of insufficient dietary intake. dietary balance index (DBI)-low bound scores (LBS) is the sum of absolute values of positive scores, indicating the degree of excessive dietary intake. The diet quality distance (DQD) is defined as the sum of dietary balance index (DBI)-low bound scores (LBS) and dietary balance index (DBI)-high bound scores (HBS) and reveal whether the individual’s food intake is balanced. The ranges of dietary balance index (DBI)-low bound scores (LBS), dietary balance index (DBI)-high bound scores (HBS), and diet quality distance (DQD) are 0–72, 0–44, and 0–96, respectively.",58336573-cd87-44fa-a546-962cda7efd0f
7,methods7," A score of 0 indicates excellent dietary intake (no problems), a score that is less than 20% of the total score indicates good dietary intake (almost no problems), a score that is 20–40% of the total score indicates acceptable dietary intake (moderate level of problems), a score that is 40–60% of total score indicates poor dietary intake (moderate level of problems), and a score greater than 60% of the total score indicates the worst dietary intake (high level of problems) [26,35].  CHealthy Eating Index (HEI) has a continuous scoring system, containing 17 food components ranging from 0–100. Twelve of the 17 components evaluate the adequacy of diet (including total grains, whole grains and mixed beans, tubers, total vegetables, dark vegetables, fruits, dairy, soybeans, fish and seafoods, poultry, eggs, seeds and nuts), and the other five components assess the limitation of diet (red meat, cooking oils, sodium, added sugars, alcohols).",3c989692-cd13-47f9-b48b-b12b2ebd318b
8,methods8," Higher intakes of adequacy food components resulted in higher scores, whereas higher intakes of limitation food components resulted in lower scores (Supplementary Table S2).  The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) is a scale based on the intake of 14 questions to indicate the degree of adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet. Meat and dairy product intake less than the median of all study participants received 1 point, and greater than the median received 0 point [17]. For all other food items, intakes above the median received 1 point and 0 point otherwise. Possible Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) scores ranged from 0 (minimal adherence to traditional Mediterranean diet) to 14 (maximal adherence) [18] (Supplementary Table S3).",e4c81da1-10bc-4608-8e8a-548be5df8efa
9,methods9,"  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was composed of eight food groups, including grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, meat, nuts/seeds/legumes, fats/oils and sweets, which are emphasized in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [36]. For each food group [37], a maximum score of 10 could be achieved when the intakes meet recommendation. If lower intakes are favored by Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, reverse scoring is applied [19,33] (Supplementary Table S4). Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is based on the overall score, ranging from 0 to 80.  2.6. Assessment of Cardiometabolic Risk Factors  Systolic and diastolic blood pressures of participants were measured twice using an automated blood pressure monitor after a quiet rest for at least 5 min. The average of two measurements was calculated and recorded.",40c753ee-5aaa-4d6b-816f-b9ac1a4c0d5e

Venous blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ℃ for serum collection. Enzymatic methods were used to determine the concentrations of serum triglyceride, TC, LDL-C and HDL-C on the Cobas 8000 c702 automated assay analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The concentrations of Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) were determined by immunonephelometry using Cobas 8000 c702 automated assay analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Fasting blood glucose concentrations were measured with whole blood using the Cobas c311 automated assay analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Concentrations of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were determined by cation-exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).  2.7.",316c1cfd-8462-46a3-8e42-2eeaaa7023c3
11,methods11," Covariates  Data on sociodemographic and lifestyle information, including marital status, education, smoking status, and employment, were collected using validated questionnaires. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer, and weight was measured with an electronic weighing scale to the nearest 0.1 kg. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated by dividing the weight (kg) by height squared (m2). Waist circumference was measured at the narrowest part of the waist using a tape measure to the nearest 0.1 cm. Measurements of height, weight, and waist circumference were repeated twice, and the average of two independent measurements was calculated and recorded.",a90a119a-dd5c-4ee6-9c52-fa4151699b6d

13,methods13," Differences in food and macronutrient intake and cardiometabolic risk factors between female and male participants were compared using 2-sample t test. Multivariable linear regression models were used to determine the associations between the four a priori dietary indexes (dietary balance index (DBI)-16, CHealthy Eating Index (HEI), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score) and cardiometabolic risk factors (lipid and lipoprotein profiles, glucose homeostasis biomarkers and blood pressures).

15,methods15,"  If significant associations were observed between at least two a priori dietary indexes and specific cardiometabolic risk factors, each variable of the cardiometabolic risk factor was dichotomized by corresponding mean value, and logistic regression models with receiver operating characteristic curve (receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)) were used to provide a conclusive mean for the comparison among four a priori dietary indexes. For model prediction performance, discrimination and calibration were evaluated. Discrimination represented the ability of the dietary indexes to differentiate between patients who did and did not have a high level of cardiometabolic risk factors. The measurement of discrimination is quantified by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) statistic. Calibration represented the agreement between predicted probabilities from the models and observed outcomes.",fe380aaa-0d1a-4c24-8b56-acc3f7ed58f5
16,methods16," We used the Hosmer-Lemeshow test to statistically determine the extent of agreement between the predicted probabilities and observed outcomes [40]. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of predictions were measured by Brier score, which denoted the observed outcome and the prediction in a dataset of 269 participants [41]. For model validation, internal validation was adopted using a bootstrapping method with 1,000 bootstrap resamples of 269 participants. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05.  3.

28,methods33," Discussion  Although much has been reported about dietary patterns and cardiometabolic health, studies directly investigate the associations between multiple a priori dietary indexes and cardiometabolic risk factors in the same group of participants are scarce, and available data for Chinese populations are strikingly limited, especially in hyperlipidemic patients. This missing information limits the attempts to update dietary guidelines for Chinese populations aimed at reducing cardiometabolic risk via dietary modifications. Our study was designed to address this research gap via assessing the associations between four frequently used a priori dietary indexes, including dietary balance index (DBI)-16, CHealthy Eating Index (HEI), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores, and cardiometabolic risk factors among Chinese hyperlipidemic patients in a cross-sectional setting.",7076a6cc-d967-4134-9b10-091edce756da
29,methods34," The unique aspect of our study is that we focused on a clinically relevant population, hyperlipidemic adults, who were at elevated risk for cardiometabolic disorders. To our knowledge, we provided the first comprehensive documentation of the associations between dietary balance index (DBI)-16, which emphasizes balanced dietary intake, and a broad range of cardiometabolic risk factors. The results of our work indicated that higher dietary balance index (DBI)-16, CHealthy Eating Index (HEI), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were associated with more favorable lipid and lipoprotein profiles and/or glucose homeostasis biomarkers. There was no significant association between the four a prior dietary indexes and blood pressures.  dietary balance index (DBI)-16 was created based on eight food components from the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Chinese and the Chinese Food Pagoda and emphasized a balanced diet with adherence to these guidelines.",db282e70-69cd-44d2-948d-e1c0bd36dca5
30,methods35," The associations between dietary balance index (DBI)-16 scores and cardiometabolic risk factors differed by the four indicators of this index. As the dietary balance index (DBI)-TS scores increased, fasting serum triglyceride concentrations decreased and concentrations of HDL-C and ApoA1 increased. These results indicated that higher overall diet quality was associated with improved triglyceride and HDL-C concentrations. On the contrary, as the dietary balance index (DBI)-low bound scores (LBS) scores increased, fasting serum triglyceride concentrations increased and concentrations of HDL-C and ApoA1 decreased. These data suggested that insufficient dietary intake resulted in unfavorable lipid and lipoprotein profiles, which may contribute to increased cardiometabolic risk.",15e1e71e-5513-402c-9ac9-06635e925667
31,methods36," As a reflection for excessive dietary intake status, the dietary balance index (DBI)-high bound scores (HBS) scores were positively associated with fasting serum glucose concentrations, indicating the potential role of excessive dietary intake in dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. In addition, our data demonstrated that better diet quality distance (DQD) scores were associated with more favorable values of a wide array of lipid and lipoprotein profiles, suggesting the importance of a balanced diet in the improvement of cardiometabolic health. Consistent with our findings, previous studies have found that low dietary balance index (DBI) scores are associated with unfavorable blood glucose and HDL-C concentrations [25] and higher prevalence of prediabetes [26] among Chinese adults. A study in European countries has also reported that in comparison to other behavioral risk factors, a balanced diet is a potential key factor to avoid cardiovascular disease-specific mortality [42].",f4b157e2-91e4-4f19-b56d-ab03217a2373
32,methods37," Prior to our study, there are strikingly limited data on the relationships between balanced diet and cardiometabolic risk factors among hyperlipidemic Chinese adults. Lacking data in this area, randomized controlled-feeding trials among individuals with elevated cardiometabolic risk are needed to capture the alterations in cardiometabolic risk factors in response to a balanced diet compared to an unbalanced diet. We also observed differential patterns for associations between dietary balance index (DBI) scores and cardiometabolic risk factors in female and male participants, indicating that sex-specific recommendations should be considered for choosing dietary patterns to improve cardiometabolic health.  We observed a negative association between CHealthy Eating Index (HEI) scores and fasting serum triglyceride concentrations. This result is consistent with previous studies [43,44].",a8016b00-4795-499f-b67e-2f3b2b70266f
33,methods38," This finding may be partially attributed to the relatively lower intakes of red and processed meats and saturated fatty acids and higher intakes of legume and legume products in participants with higher CHealthy Eating Index (HEI) scores. High intakes of red and processed meats and saturated fatty acids have been reported to be associated with increased prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia [45,46], and substitution legumes for red meats results in significant reduction in triglyceride concentrations in overweight type 2 diabetic patients [47]. Compared to dietary balance index (DBI)-16, CHealthy Eating Index (HEI) scores were not associated with other lipid and lipoprotein profiles or glucose homeostasis biomarkers, indicating that CHealthy Eating Index (HEI) may not be suitable for comprehensive evaluations of the relationships between diet quality and cardiometabolic risk factors.",ba9b7eb7-31e7-440c-b994-ed3848960b89
34,methods39," Of note, CHealthy Eating Index (HEI) is one-sided and has only one overall score to reflect whether an individual’s overall dietary intakes meet recommended requirements of dietary guidelines. We cannot rule out the possibility that excessive food and nutrient intakes obscured potential associations between associations between diet quality and cardiometabolic risk factors.  Our study provided the first documentation that the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) scores were only associated with fasting HbA1c concentrations in study participants in models adjusted for age, sex and Body mass index (BMI), and the association was no longer significant in fully adjusted models. Possible explanation of this null finding may be attributed to the extremely low Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) scores in these participants, indicating low adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet.",d7be87d6-064a-4b6e-96da-23536259da22
35,methods40," Due to the differences in dietary, social and cultural background between China and the Mediterranean regions, the traditional Mediterranean diet may not be appropriate for instructing dietary intakes among Chinese populations.  In our study, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were significantly associated with decreased concentrations of fasting blood glucose. The potential underlying mechanisms responsible for the association may be attributed, in part, to emphasis in higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, nuts and legumes and lower intakes of total and saturated fatty acids in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern [22]. The intakes of fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, and nuts and legumes individually or collectively contribute to blood glucose homeostasis [48,49,50].",68f983e2-857f-4e2a-8f74-2f9443bd4062
36,methods41," In addition, higher adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern has been reported to be associated with decreased incidence of type 2 diabetes [51]. No association between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and blood pressures was observed in our study. Although this null finding was somewhat unexpected, it is consistent with a previous randomized controlled trial in Hong Kong, which has reported that nutrition counselling with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet combined with physician’s usual care for 12 months has no significantly different effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressures compared with physician’s usual care alone [52].",ea517bf4-922f-4f7f-91b6-5678c9b69888
37,methods42," However, a cross-sectional study has demonstrated inverse associations between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and prevalence of hypertension in Chinese adults [53], while another multi-ethnic group study including Chinese individuals has reported opposite conclusions [54]. Collectively, it is still controversial as to whether the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet could be used to assist Chinese populations in the prevention of hypertension as well as other cardiometabolic risks; hence, further research is required on this topic.  There are several strengths in this study. Four a priori (hypothesis-driven) dietary indexes were used, which captured the overall quality and complexity of diet and possible interplay among foods and nutrients. The target group consisted of hyperlipidemic patients who were at high-risk for cardiometabolic disorders and were most likely to benefit from dietary modifications for optimizing cardiometabolic risk factors.",cc75bcd9-7558-4c4d-bd61-4a3530ac0881
38,methods43," A broader range of dietary indexes was assessed than previously reported. A limitation of this study was that with the observational nature of this study, causality could not be interpreted and potential mechanisms underlying the associations between a priori dietary indexes and cardiometabolic risk factors were not investigated.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, better dietary balance index (DBI)-16, CHealthy Eating Index (HEI), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were associated with more favorable lipid and lipoprotein profiles and/or glucose homeostasis biomarkers among Chinese hyperlipidemic participants in this cross-sectional study. There was no significant association between the four a prior dietary indexes and blood pressures.",96fef45c-5acd-4894-9ece-f1ca75c28ede
39,methods44," Among four a priori dietary indexes assessed, dietary balance index (DBI)-16 was more suitable for a comprehensive evaluation of the overall diet quality and balance for optimizing cardiometabolic health among hyperlipidemic individuals. In particular, better diet quality distance (DQD) scores were associated with more favorable fasting serum cholesterol and lipoprotein profiles. These findings add new information to the current literature, suggesting that maintaining a balanced diet could be incorporated in current dietary guidelines for the Chinese population, aimed at reducing cardiometabolic risk.
