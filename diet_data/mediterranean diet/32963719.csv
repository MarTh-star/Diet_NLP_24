Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) has been successfully adapted for some cultures but may be challenged by the need for intensive resources; MD may be more beneficial if applied as part of a broader set of food procurement/preparation practices than as just diet alone; EAT Lancet diet (EAT)-Lancet adaptation may not honor existing country-specific practices that are already beneficial to human and environmental health (e.g. traditional/plant-based diets); evidence for cultural adaptation is limited with NOVA Classification System (NOVA), but classification of levels of food processing has potential for widespread application.",8ce58e1a-bf7b-47b5-a493-19dfa3bf22c4
1,results1,"  Conclusions:  For DR to equitably support diverse populations, they must move beyond a Eurocentric or ‘general population’ framing, be more inclusive of cultural differences and honour social practices to improve diet and reduce disparities.  Keywords  Cultural adaptation Racial/ethnic minority groups Mediterranean diet Dietary approaches to stop hypertension EAT Lancet diet (EAT)-Lancet NOVA Classification System (NOVA) ==== Body pmcAdherence to dietary recommendations (DR) remains a challenge for the majority of Americans for a number of reasons including taste preferences, limitations in nutrition education or food preparation knowledge, or most importantly, the systemic barriers leading to inequitable access to healthy food. It is well established that racial/ethnic minorities and those at lower income levels in the USA have poorer diet quality compared with whites and individuals at higher income levels(1,2).",2b1d8c8f-0b7b-425c-8902-79e3dafb5de6
2,results2," One dimension that has been less explored is the potential limitation of existing DR in considering diverse cultural values around food that may consequently compromise nutritional intake. Increasingly, immigrant communities – a large proportion which are Latina/x/o and Asian in the USA – maintain culinary traditions that are diverse and differ widely from a typical American dietary pattern(3–7). The cultural dimension of eating, which is crucial for staying connected with cultural identity and community(8), has rarely been accounted for related public health guidance, including the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)(9–11).  Cultural adaptation can potentially bridge the gap between existing DRs and health equity(12). Additionally, we put forth the notion that some recommendations may be more readily adapted to different cultures than others without significant increase in financial burden.",200b6424-1719-429c-9d0c-9c993dcca7eb
3,results3," With a focus on the diverse population in the USA, this commentary first briefly describes salient features of the DGA, then against this backdrop describes the specific content, origin, purpose and level of adaptability from prior cultural adaptations of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, the Mediterranean Diet, the EAT Lancet diet (EAT)-Lancet diet and the NOVA Classification System (NOVA) classification system. Similar to DGA, these widely used and emerging DR (i.e. patterns and frameworks) in the USA focus on physical well-being and lack attention to the cultural perspective that contributes to social and emotional health(13–15). We conclude with suggestions for broadening the scope of cultural adaptation towards sustainable behavioural changes for nutritional health and general well-being among the racial/ethnic minority populations.  Dietary guidelines for Americans  An overview of DGA is included in Table 1.",427a2051-4a32-4f75-a8e4-b22589ee4a2d
4,results4," While the DGA suggest considerations of ‘personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary conditions’(16), the recommendations are based on the intake of the general US population – data which underrepresent the preferences of diverse racial/ethnic minority subgroups(17). Further, the DGA emphasise foods based on their nutrient density for the benefit of reducing disease risks(16) – which runs counter to foodways of other cultures that prioritises social connections(8). In other words, compliance to DGA means (1) prioritising physical health over social and emotional health and (2) adhering to a dietary pattern that does not account for cultural dimension, and therefore disproportionately impacts minorities in the USA.",cf5266dc-f421-40f4-9c25-8c76ea560137
5,results5," Lastly, the DGA inform federally funded food and nutrition programmes that disproportionately serve racial/ethnic minorities(18,19), yet the mismatch of eating behaviours and preferences and reductionist nutrition in the absence of sociocultural influences may be inadequate to improve nutrition in these groups.

16,results16,"  Dietary approaches to stop hypertension  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet embodies a public health mission of addressing hypertension, implying its explicit emphasis on the absence of a specified disease and not the maintenance of well-being of a general population(13).  Cultural adaptation of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is straightforward for food group recommendations but less so with nutrients(13). Individuals lack data on nutrient composition of cultural foods that are not easily accessible to the public(13), which requires substantial resources from both programme participants and implementers(22–25). In addition to cultural adaptation of food- and nutrition-related materials, counseling sessions or food environment assessments were also included as part of the interventions.",9dbe4e16-7dfc-49cb-a8c1-b41f5eca793b
17,results17," For example, two 10- to 12-week studies that each adapted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) to Korean or Latin cultures included modifications on the unit of measure and examples of foods in each food group(20,23) and multiple in-person and telephone sessions(20,21). Another cultural adaptation of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was a 12-week randomised controlled pilot with African Americans by identifying traditional foods and dietary habits and including a food environment assessment of the participants’ neighbourhood(24). These studies suggest Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) has been adapted across a number of cultures and populations and short-term health improvements. However, it is unclear whether Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is feasible for individual- or community-level adaptation, and whether the treatment-oriented end-goal, i.e. reduce blood pressure, is appropriate for everyday use.",4a536470-b278-4e61-934b-441143a6c866
18,results18,"  Mediterranean diet  Mediterranean diet (MD) is similar to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) in its emphasis on physical health but is also recognised as an ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity’ by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization(6):‘A set of skills, knowledge, rituals, symbols and traditions concerning…particularly the sharing and consumption of food. Eating together is the foundation of the cultural identity and continuity of communities…social exchange and communication…emphasizes values of hospitality, neighbourliness, intercultural dialogue and creativity, and a way of life guided by respect for diversity. It plays a vital role in…bringing together people of all ages, conditions and social classes…Markets also play a key role as spaces for cultivating and transmitting the Mediterranean diet during the daily practice of exchange, agreement and mutual respect.",f159ef5e-70d6-4c5b-afd4-ebfc18f9612b
19,results19,"’(6)  It is noteworthy that while much of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization description overlaps with multiple contextual factors which have been the focus of public health efforts in recent years – including social cohesion, community engagement and climate change(22–24) – in the day-to-day understanding of this diet, these factors are largely absent. These upstream factors illustrate the important contexts in which MD is to be adapted, yet they are not translated into the popular version of MD, which focuses solely on food composition. Cultural adaptation of the current MD version means failure to account for the social connections with foods, which possibly compromises the benefits of following a MD in its entirety(7).  MD has been culturally adapted to Latina/x/o and Black populations in the USA. The studies involving Latina/x/o specified surface-structure (e.g. language, food items) and, to varying degree, deep-structure adaptations (e.g.",5bedcd6b-9668-4c39-b97f-0e051dbed435
20,results20," including family members) and also indicated good acceptability from Latina/x/o participants of the adapted MD plan(21,25). The Heart Healthy Lenoir Project, which involved a majority of Black, low-income participants, culturally adapted by retaining Southeastern foods and focused on the quality of oil(26). To our knowledge, no USA-based studies have adapted the MD for Asian subgroups despite their cardiometabolic risks being higher than whites and the USA general population(11–15). To summarise, cultural adaptations of the MD that consider social and cultural elements to some degree seem to have been met with some success for diverse groups(8,19). However, the broader question of whether it is even ‘appropriate’ to impose a cultural diet onto an entirely different culture persists.",43008426-a3cd-48ca-b0e8-403c7d4cdac8
21,results21,"  EAT Lancet diet (EAT)-Lancet reference diet  Similar to MD and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), the EAT Lancet diet (EAT)-Lancet Reference Diet (EAT Lancet diet (EAT)) addresses physical health both directly through individual-level food selection and indirectly through system-level food production. EAT Lancet diet (EAT) is relatively new and therefore little evidence of cultural adaptation exists, but current research points to the fact that components of EAT Lancet diet (EAT) may serve as barriers to cultural adaptation. A global initiative, EAT Lancet diet (EAT) claims that the dietary pattern is applicable to all food cultures, but its scientific basis, similar to DGA, is largely and narrowly drawn from literature based in North America(15). We illustrate this through three observations.",6e074d94-a61c-4a5e-bd43-daa134a5b3fe
22,results22," First, the suggestion of EAT Lancet diet (EAT) to consume minimal/no animal source foods overlooks the European- and Asian-based studies demonstrating benefits in consuming amounts of animal source food higher than EAT Lancet diet (EAT)’s recommendation(27–31). Second, the food group recommendations in EAT Lancet diet (EAT) undercut the ‘plant-based’ diets that some cultures, such as those in Southeast Asia, have already followed throughout the millennia(32,33). Lastly, the emphasis in EAT Lancet diet (EAT) to shift to plant-based diet may create financial burden for racial/ethnic minority populations, who disproportionately experience food insecurity in an environment where plant-based foods remain more costly compared to meat or processed foods in terms of energy density(34,35). To summarise, EAT Lancet diet (EAT)’s global reach and its considerations for environmental health through dietary change demonstrate a shift away from the focus of only physical health.",dc06bfe8-173d-4ab6-ba4b-ed9a5c76e797
23,results23," Moreover, its narrow scientific evidence makes adherence to EAT Lancet diet (EAT) less feasible for diverse communities, in some cases may be inadvisable, and takes a primarily Eurocentric/meat-based approach.  NOVA Classification System (NOVA) classification system  In contrast to DGA, MD, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and EAT Lancet diet (EAT) that make recommendations for food groups based on their nutrient composition and density, the NOVA Classification System (NOVA) Classification System (NOVA Classification System (NOVA)) provides a framework for classifying single food items according to the level of processing. The origin of NOVA Classification System (NOVA) is similar, however, to the other DR in that it was developed out of concern for ultra-processed foods and their detrimental impacts on physical health(36).",8ecf0f81-e5c6-497c-a068-8bff27a68d81
24,results24," NOVA Classification System (NOVA) is by design considerate of cultural diversity by encouraging the shift of food choices to less processed foods to opting for regional/local ingredients that are less likely to require a higher level of processing for food preservation and/or storage(37). Moving away from ultra-processed foods means preserving food culture at the local level on the global landscape. No studies to date have engaged in cultural adaptation of NOVA Classification System (NOVA) in the USA, except for a study that suggests nutrition education involving NOVA Classification System (NOVA) to be appropriate for a racially/ethnically diverse group of college students(36). In summary, despite a lack of evidence thus far, NOVA Classification System (NOVA) with its simple to follow message that takes into consideration sociocultural factors may be a viable option as a basis for nudging individuals towards better nutrition across multiple diverse groups.

25,discussion0," By 2045, the USA will become a ‘majority minority’ community(38), but DR do not serve all Americans equitably. They rely on evidence derived from the general USA population and/or a Eurocentric perspective, with regards to foods consumed, food choices, affordability and underlying nutrition profile. The importance of eating is reduced from a sociocultural significance to a carrier of nutrients for physical health.  The DR described in this commentary differ in their origin and evolution but are similar in their reductionist emphasis on physical health. The cultural adaptation interventions we examined here are limited by scarcity of resources and, for the most part, limited to adaptation at the surface level(38), which is likely due to the fact that social science literature that pertains to food and culture(9,39,40) is largely absent in the science base of the DR.",20e433fb-6fbf-4d6d-a3db-e9463fa933f9

Despite the shortfalls, we are inspired by some elements of these DR and suggest four key aspects for consideration when developing DR centered on cultural orientation: (1) to address nutrition and health in the context of food and cultural studies, practices and history; (2) to actively engage racial/ethnic minorities and immigrants to explore their preferences and traditions they wish to preserve and document them to build the evidence base; (3) to distinguish dietary patterns that are for disease treatment (i.e.",a4c8bc9a-37dd-4d90-965a-13e0c9823676

Adherence to the current DR may support physical health but may compromise social and emotional health(44) and, in some cases, ethnic identity and well-being(45). The demographic shift towards a more diverse population means our evidence base for DR needs to be reflective of the racial and ethnic diversity and associated diversity of food cultures.",6529ae5f-0083-49c9-80c4-9f12fa256256
