1,methods1," Study Selection-Eligibility Criteria  Eligible studies for inclusion to systematic review were original observational studies that investigated the impact of MD adherence on three or more parameters of MetS (WC, high density lipoprotein (HDL), TG, Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and fasting blood glucose (FBG)), according to the revised criteria National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) ATP III [11], in the adult population, using a validated tool or scoring algorithm. MDSs developed by Panagiotakos et al. [31], Sofi et al. [32] and Trichopoulou et al. [21], as well as the PREDIMED MD Adherence Screener (MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) score [33], the short MDS produced by Martinez Gonzalez et al.

2,methods2," [36], the MD quality index [37], the relative MD system [38], and modified versions of MDSs [39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49], were used in our included studies. A summary of the diagnostic criteria of MetS can be found in Table 1. Studies that were not published as original papers (e.g., abstracts, conference papers, editorials and commentaries, etc.) were excluded. Additionally, manuscripts that did not provide adequate data regarding low and high adherence to MD were also excluded from this analysis. Only studies in English and Spanish language were part of our review.  2.3. Data Extraction  Records of our search results were imported into a reference management software (Endnote X9 for windows-by Clarivate Analytics USA) and two reviewers (LC, DB), after the removal of duplicates, assessed the studies for eligibility. Any disagreements were solved by a third reviewer (EK).",d5aa8852-7064-433a-af98-7b3ee35babd8
3,methods3," Data extraction was performed independently by the above-mentioned two reviewers using a pre-specified standardized Microsoft® excel form and was checked for accuracy by a third reviewer (EK). In cases of missing data, corresponding authors were contacted by email in order to retrieve any additional data.  The primary outcome of our study was to investigate the impact of high adherence to MD compared to low adherence to MD on the five parameters of MetS according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) ATP III [11] revised criteria for diagnosis.  2.4. Quality Assessment of Included Studies  The quality of the eligible studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS)) adjusted version for cross-sectional studies by two independent authors (LC and DB) [50]. Any disagreements that arose were solved by consensus and by the involvement of a third author (EK).",7058652f-c5a6-4c99-b691-660907f45748
4,methods4," Sensitivity analysis was further performed after the exclusion of low-quality studies (Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) < 7).  2.5. Statistical Analysis  Means and standard deviations (SD) from eligible studies reported high and low MD adherence for each parameter of MetS were used. Wherever it was necessary, and data were presented as median, minimum or maximum values or 95% confidence intervals (CI), conversion to mean and SD was performed [51,52,53,54]. When values of fasting blood glucose (FBG), TG and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were presented as mmol/L, conversion to mg/dL was employed using the Omni calculator [55]. The inverse variance method was used in order to estimate the weight of each study. The random effects model was used due to higher methodological heterogeneity among the included studies [56,57].",992620fa-dea8-4e64-8c27-ad10b09a2ead
5,methods5," Moreover, Hedge’s g was used as effect size and standardized mean difference (standardized mean difference (SMD)) as a summary statistic model due to the heterogenous scores using in included studies for the definition of low and high adherence to MD [56]. Estimation of heterogeneity was performed with Cochrane Q test (p < 0.1: existence of heterogeneity) and I2 statistic [56,57]. I2 values >50% indicated substantial heterogeneity across studies. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger’s test [53]. All statistical analyses were performed using the R software developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies version 4.0.2).  3. Results  3.1. Search Results  A total of 9933 studies were identified through the literature search. After removing 3654 duplicates, 6279 studies were detailed screened for eligibility. The process of eligibility of our included studies can be found in the flow diagram in Figure 1.",af2d33ea-673b-4d88-be0e-40f1c37c1bd3
6,methods7," Five studies were characterized as unsatisfactory due to their ratings (2–4 stars) [43,67,75,80,107], whereas for 17 studies the quality was only satisfactory (5–6 stars) [39,49,61,63,71,86,92,93,94,96,97,100,104,105]. The majority of the included studies (n = 28) [40,44,45,47,58,59,60,62,65,68,69,70,72,74,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,87,88,95,101,103,106] were good quality studies (7–8 stars), and eight studies were at the top of quality studies scoring 9 stars [46,64,66,73,91,98,99,102].

8,methods9," Waist Circumference (WC)  In three studies in which OR of the prevalence of WC >102 cm for males and >88 cm for females was used as a measure of the effect, low odds for this outcome were observed in the groups of high adherence to MD [39,99,104]. Moreover, in the study by Mirmiran et al. [103], in which the incidence of abnormalities during 3 years follow-up was examined and expressed as OR, a lower incidence was found in the high adherence group, but this was not significant (p > 0.05). In Aridi et al. [95] and Mattei et al. [101], a significantly lower mean WC was found in the high adherence groups, as well as in 3 more studies [98,102,107] in which follow-up results were obtained. In Rumavas et al. [106], a significantly lower geometric mean of WC in the high adherence group was reported (p < 0.001), and in Steffen et al., the prevalence of subjects reporting an unhealthy WC was significantly lower in the high adherence group [44].",17992e8e-e3ca-4e3b-b269-2d8d5a892b52
9,methods10," Only in one study, WC did not differ between the low and the high adherence group [40].  The meta-analysis results showed a lower WC in the low adherence group [standardized mean difference (SMD): −0.20, (95%CI: −0.40, −0.01)] with a high heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 95%) as presented in Figure 2. In order to explore the heterogeneity, a subgroup analysis of higher quality (Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) > 7) and lower quality (Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) < 7) studies was performed, which led to not significant results (standardized mean difference (SMD): −0.19 (95%CI: −0.48, 0.10)) and I2 = 96% as can be seen in Supplementary Figure S2.  3.5.2. high density lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol  In subjects reporting high adherence to MD, the ORs of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol <40 mg/dL for males and <50 mg/dL for females were lower, compared to low adherers but not significantly [39,99,104], even after three years of follow-up [103].",97becd10-0f81-4b16-9421-4f6b46e23ee0
10,methods11," Mean and geometric mean high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations were increased in the high adherence groups [40,97,98,100,105,106,107]. A significantly increased (p = 0.0258) high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration in the high adherence group was reported by Yang et al. [43]. In Aridi et al. [95] and Steffen et al. [44], the percentage of subjects with increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was higher in the high MD adherence group compared to the low adherence group. On the contrary, in two studies, the mean high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration was higher in low adherence compared to high adherence groups [101,102]. Only in Barnaba et al., no difference regarding the mean high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration was found between the moderate-high adherence group and the low adherence to MD group [96].  Results of our meta-analysis can be found in the forest plot of Figure 3.",db954b0b-87c4-4901-b401-0942db84aac1
11,methods12," Significant higher high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration in the high adherence to MD group was observed (standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.28 (95%CI: 0.07, 0.50)) with high heterogeneity among the included studies I2 = 96%.  In the subgroup analysis (based on the quality of studies per Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS)), the significantly increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration was remained after excluding the low-quality studies (standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.36 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.68)) with I2 = 98% as can be seen in Supplementary Figure S3.  3.5.3. Serum Triglycerides  Regarding the studies which used OR as a measure of effect, in three studies [99,103,104], the ORs of having TG concentration above 150 mg/dL were lower for the high adherence group, and in only one study, the OR was higher [39].",ecd7159d-57c6-4fdb-81c1-8d6ec03f43e3
12,methods13," Means and geometric means TG concentration were observed to be lower in high adherence groups [40,43,98,100,102,105,106,107] compared to the low adherence groups. Similarly, in Steffen et al. [44], a significantly lower percentage was reported for increased TG concentration in the high adherence to MD group compared to the low adherence group. In contrast, in two studies led by Barnaba and by Matei, a higher concentration of TG was reported in the high-moderate adherence group and in the high adherence group, respectively, compared to the low adherence group [96,101]. Additionally, in the study led by Aridi, a higher, but not significant, percentage reported increased TG concentration in the high adherence to MD group compared to the low adherence group [95].  After performing the meta-analysis, TG concentration was found to be lower in the high adherence to MD group compared to the low adherence group (standardized mean difference (SMD): −0.27 (95%CI: −0.44, −0.",0f711181-1965-4e75-8e24-7f0067aacbf5

In the subgroup analysis of low- and high-quality studies, the same results also remained after excluding the low-quality studies (standardized mean difference (SMD): −0.29 (95% CI: −0.52, −0.05)) with I2 = 97% (Supplementary Figure S4).  3.5.4. Fasting Blood Glucose  In 2 studies by Alvarez-Leon et al. [39] and Mirmiran et al. [103], ORs of having fasting blood glucose (FBG) >180 mg/dL were higher in the high adherence group to MD in comparison to the low adherence group, whereas in 2 other studies were opposite (ORs were lower regarding in the high adherence group) [99,104]. Means and geometric means concentration of fasting blood glucose (FBG) were lower in high adherers compared to low MD adherers [43,97,98,100,105,106]. According to Aridi et al. and Steffen et al.",4de455bf-8bd9-4c2c-aea9-c7264828fcc0
14,methods15," studies, a lower percentage of subjects presented fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentration >110 mg/dL in the high adherence group compared to the low adherence to MD group [44,95]. However, the mean concentration of fasting blood glucose (FBG) was increased in high adherers compared to low adherers [40,102,107] and low-moderate adherers [96].  The meta-analysis results can be found in Figure 5. There was no difference in fasting blood glucose (FBG) between the two groups (standardized mean difference (SMD): −0.21 (95%CI: −0.54, 0.12)). The above did not change after performing a subgroup analysis per the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) classification (standardized mean difference (SMD): −0.24 (95%CI: −0.70, 0.22) for the high-quality studies) as can be seen in Supplementary Figure S5.  3.5.5.",3ef53ec3-4974-4018-839f-122b4ca1f4c2
15,methods16," Systolic Blood Pressure (Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP))  Regarding the Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), in four studies, the ORs of a measuring Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) >130 mmHg were lower in subjects reporting high adherence to MD compared to low adherers [39,99,103,104]. Moreover, means and geometric means of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) were lower in the high adherence group compared to the low adherence group [40,98,102,106]. According to Aridi et al. [95] and Steffen et al. [44], lower percentages of subjects presented Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) >130 mmHg from the high adherence to MD group compared to the low adherence group. Three studies reported the opposite (higher Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) was observed in higher adherence to MD) [43,101,107].  Meta-analysis results can be found in Figure 6. Lower Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) was observed in the high adherence group but not significant (standardized mean difference (SMD):−0.15 (95% CI: −0.38, 0.",95e79753-94ce-4ea9-b84c-50a96f2b54e7

This result did not change after the performance of a subgroup analysis based on the quality of studies (standardized mean difference (SMD): −0.25 (95%CI: −0.60, 0.10), I2 = 98%) as can be seen in Supplementary Figure S6.  4. Discussion  Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between a low and high level of adherence to MD and risk parameters of MetS, according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)-ATP III criteria. The present study, examining 41 observational studies, revealed a positive impact of MD on the five components of MetS, including WC, high density lipoprotein (HDL), TG, FG and BP. Although a previous meta-analysis conducted by Kastorini et al.",a2e5fa33-4df0-4bbe-9f90-852d10e81350
17,methods18," [30] explored the effect of MD on MetS prevalence, including its components, this is the first meta-analysis estimating the impact of the level of adherence to MD on each parameter of MetS according to evidence obtained by MD adherence scores.  With regards to abdominal obesity, our results showed a significant inverse association between WC and adherence to MD. Only one study [40] did not find any statistical difference in WC between the different levels of adherence to MD groups, which could be attributed to the underlying health condition of participants (CKD patients). Increased WC, which was detected in the low adherence to MD subjects, along with the accumulation of visceral fat, have been linked to the presence of low-grade systemic inflammation, increased oxidative stress and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a [109,110].",65f6b7e7-5c03-41a8-b128-ce459d3286a7
18,methods19," These metabolic abnormalities have a direct impact on other biochemical risk markers of MetS, and more specifically high density lipoprotein (HDL), TG and FG, which consequently stimulate atherogenesis and mediate insulin resistance [111]. The high content of antioxidants, polyphenols and fiber found in MD have been previously associated with decreased systemic inflammation and central obesity, which could explain its beneficial effect [112,113]. Moreover, an enhanced with nuts MD was found to be helpful regarding the maintenance of body weight status [114,115].  A significantly positive correlation was also found between high adherence to MD and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration. Our findings are consistent with previously reported data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), in which a Mediterranean dietary pattern improved high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration and the overall lipid profile [116,117,118].",c0eee078-e809-402d-8448-9af249615b6e
19,methods20," Increased intake of olive oil, polyphenols, antioxidants as well as an optimal ratio of MUFA:SFA, through the adherence to MD, seemed to have a synergistic effect on various mechanisms of lipid metabolism by promoting changes on the overall composition of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol particles, increased antioxidant and cholesterol efflux capacity [117,119]. Furthermore, a higher high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration observed in high MD adherers could potentially be a secondary effect closely related to lower mean values of central obesity, as aforementioned, and improved cardiometabolic risk markers.  According to our results, an inverse significant association was observed between TGs concentration and adherence to MD. In a large network meta-analysis performed by Tsartsou et al. [108], the protective effect of MD on the overall lipid profile, including TGs, was also demonstrated.",db1a6e82-39cf-4919-87cd-97755a5a3007
20,methods21," These findings were mainly attributed to the high content of olive oil polyphenols and oleic acid as part of the MD [108]. Another meta-analysis of RCTs, investigating the effect of plant oils on blood lipids, had also reported a decrease in TG concentration from the use of diets rich in olive oil [120]. Notwithstanding, it was demonstrated that oils rich in omega-3-fatty acids (n-3 FAs) caused a greater decrease in TGs than olive oil [120]. The metabolic mechanisms responsible for these changes are related to the types of fatty acids, i.e., MUFAS and n-3 FAs, which have the ability to suppress postprandial TGs, enhance TG clearance, decrease the activity of TG lipase and the overall TG synthesis [121,122,123].",78b4d19c-3a88-49c8-b662-4d4375ae2380
21,methods22,"  Taking the above into consideration, where the mean values of WC, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and serum TG concentration were significantly closer to normal in the high adherence to MD groups compared to the low adherence group, we conclude that the level of adherence to MD could play an important role to ameliorate the obesity level and the impaired lipid profile, in combination or not with appropriate pharmacological treatment.  With respect to fasting blood glucose (FBG), an inverse correlation was demonstrated between MD levels of adherence and fasting blood glucose (FBG), which, however, was not statistically significant. A possible explanation for that could be the high number of individuals diagnosed with diabetes or at diabetic risk who participated in the studies [49,61,65,68,69,70,71,74,81,92], along with other confounding factors (e.g., age, BMI, medication, etc.).",a3b860ee-ed4b-4d25-888a-bdbf704efb11
22,methods23," However, the fact that mean values of fasting blood glucose (FBG) in both high and low adherers were within the normal range led us to the conclusion that MD adherence can have a positive impact on glycemic control regardless of the level of adherence. Sufficient evidence exists supporting the positive effect of adherence to MD so as to improve glycemic control and decrease the overall risk of T2DM [124]. A systematic review of 17 studies assessing the effect of MD on the incidence of T2DM revealed that high adherence to MD was significantly correlated with improved fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentration and HbA1c in diabetic patients [125]. Additionally, both RCTs and prospective cohort studies have also confirmed the benefits of MD on glycemic control over other diets among different subgroups of the population, including healthy individuals, individuals with high cardiovascular disease (CVD)/T2DM risk or diabetic patients [65,126,127].",329cd5b6-2010-4e2e-8771-17935a7915a6
23,methods24," These outcomes have been closely related to the composition of MD, which is rich in anti-inflammatory compounds, as well as to its enhanced activity of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) hormone and to changes in gut microbiome caused by MD [48]. Notwithstanding, a meta-analysis by Ajala et al. on 20 RCTs demonstrated that not only MD but also low-carbohydrate, low-glycemic-index and high protein diets could enhance the cardiometabolic profile [128].  Regarding Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and adherence to MD level, we have also found an inverse but non-statistically significant association. Hypertension is considered a major risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD)s [129]. It has been previously demonstrated that prolonged adherence to MD can decrease both Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and DBP [130].",6bfcd729-54fc-45cd-b497-fee5aa21599e
24,methods25,"  According to our included studies, in a vast majority, the mean Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) was <130 mmHg in both low and high adherence to MD groups. Consequently, we can conclude that even a poor adherence to MD can positively influence Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP). This conclusion is in accordance with existing data from previously published studies that have reported a significant inverse correlation between adherence of MD and BP [131,132]. Moreover, two recent meta-analyses showed that MD could significantly reduce BP when compared to control diets [133,134]. In addition, a greater decrease in BP was recorded for subjects presented with higher BP at baseline and in studies with a longer duration of the intervention [133]. Various nutrients included in MD exerted beneficial effects through improved vasodilation and endothelial function such as nitric oxides, flavonoids and minerals [135].  The benefits of MD adherence are not limited to the five parameters of MetS [136].",77d1d956-b57f-4ec0-8e20-98f2ce7b64b0
25,methods26," MiRNAs were found to be better regulated in obese patients following an MD [137]. Recent studies have shown that an MD reduces serum inflammatory markers as well as the incidence of stroke, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and breast cancer [138,139]. Moreover, MD was recommended as a diet that can help women with menopause-related symptoms and needs [140].  Our study can be characterized by several strengths. According to our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that aimed to examine the impact of the level of adherence to an MD on the parameters of MetS. Moreover, the great number of the studies included and the subjects examined (n = 74,058), whose origin covered a significant part of the world, made our results quite representative. Furthermore, publication biases were not detected in our study, except from the studies included for the TG parameter in which the p-value of Egger’s test was not rounded up 0.04598.",5e3195a8-eebb-4ee1-8a4c-50fe60efb8ff
26,methods27," In addition, the fact that we have included studies that used validated MD adherence scores in order to assess the level of adherence to MD increased the accuracy of our conclusions. The limitations of our study mainly concerned the heterogeneity in the included studies. High heterogeneity was detected for all parameters of MetS, which was potentially due to the different types of population (i.e., ethnicity) and health status (i.e., healthy, obese/overweight and diagnosed conditions) across all included studies, as well as to the difference between sample sizes and the use of a variety of MDS. The presence of high heterogeneity in population samples and the fact that subjects under pharmacological treatment were not excluded do not allow for inference of our results regarding the role of MD. Over and above, the variety of MDSs used to assess adherence among studies introduces biases due to the different ways of classification and quantification of food components.",547efb05-0140-4ae0-b569-8bdff17121d3
27,methods28," Furthermore, levels of adherence to MD may be perceived differently, depending on the geographical location and, thus, produce additional bias. For example, high adherers living in Mediterranean regions might have a greater intake of specific foods when compared to high adherers residing in non-Mediterranean regions. Moreover, the conversion of data whenever necessary for unification of the quantitative analysis adds to our study’s limitations. Moreover, we have included studies published in English and Spanish; therefore, studies published in a different language were not a part of this study.  5. Conclusions  High adherence to MD can have a positive impact on all parameters of MetS. In addition, there is sufficient evidence suggesting that long-term consumption of MD can protect from obesity and improve cardiometabolic risk markers, including the markers used for the diagnosis of MetS.",fb8006fc-7ce1-48b1-97e7-87d7bbf0afb2
28,methods29," Although high heterogeneity was identified across the included studies, our results support previous findings and point to the potential biases that may derive from the use of MDSs. Furthermore, it remains still unclear whether MD exerts the same beneficial effect on both unhealthy and healthy populations; therefore, further research is needed in this field.
