0,introduction0,"  Line 82 “ the aim of this protocol is to provide”… not sure if “protocol” suits with the work presented in this research.   A healthy diet and high health-related physical fitness levels may be part of an overall healthy lifestyle. The relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and physical fitness levels has been analyzed in several studies. However, no studies have synthesized evidence on this relationship throughout adulthood. Moreover, in addition to the overall Mediterranean dietary pattern, the associations of individual components of the Mediterranean diet with physical fitness indicators are also unclear.

Figure 1 cannot be found within the manuscript or not properly labeled.  Line 151. Scoring for adherence to Mediterranean diet shall be briefly described in addition to previous references.   Protocol and registration  This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol was drafted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement [20] (S1 Table). The systematic review and meta-analysis have been previously registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022308259). It will be conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and following the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook [21].,0e5564c0-5dd4-4981-a9c1-3abed73f57fa
2,methods1," Ethics committee approval and/or informed consent from patients will not be required since no primary data will be collected.  Eligibility criteria  To be included, studies retrieved from the peer-reviewed literature must report the following: (i) population: healthy or unhealthy adults (≥18 years); (ii) intervention/exposure: the adherence of the MD according to the overall score of different scales (e.g., Mediterranean Diet Score, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener) and to specific components (foods and nutrients) of these scoring systems; (iii) outcome: PF components (cardiorespiratory fitness, musculoskeletal fitness, and motor fitness) by using standardized tests; (iv) designs: observational studies (cross-sectional, case–control, prospective/retrospective cohort and longitudinal) and randomized controlled trials; and (v) period: published before January 31st, 2022.",27ea82f5-10f8-4c5a-bc3b-b187fd50ba50
3,methods2," Moreover, studies will be excluded if they report: (i) duplicate data published in another included study; (ii) diet in terms of intake of single nutrients, food items, and food groups; (iii) special interest group data (e.g., elite athletes or firefighters); (iv) PF measured by self-report; (v) qualitative data; and (vi) data published as conference/meeting abstracts.  Search methods for study identification  The systematic search will be conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane CENTRAL from database inception up to 31 January 2022. No filters will be used in the systematic search. Further studies will be located by additional searches where reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews will be screened for potential relevance. In case of a lack of data, experts will be contacted requesting information.  The electronic database searches will be limited to keywords, title and abstract.",c1d2a2b3-3392-4ed5-ae99-7008af27eff5

The full text of the identified studies will be screened by two researchers independently against the inclusion/exclusion criteria, with consensus required for final inclusion. Discrepancies between researchers will be resolved by reaching consensus or with the intervention of a third reviewer. The results of the search and selection process will be described using the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram (Fig 1).  10.1371/journal.pone.0271254.g001 Fig 1 PRISMA flow diagram for identifying, screening, and determining the eligibility and inclusion of studies.  Data collection process  One researcher will perform data extraction on a standardized template, and a second researcher will check for accuracy. If necessary, additional data will be requested from the corresponding authors via email.",f7a55c6f-4aad-4906-8a18-4000a08e1140
7,methods6,"  The following study-specific data will be extracted: 1) name of the first author and year of publication; 2) country; 3) study design; 4) sample size; 5) participant information (sex and age); 6) adult age group (young, middle-aged, or older adults); 7) MD adherence indices; 8) specific Mediterranean foods; 9) PF component; and 10) main findings. The information will be summarized in a ""Table of characteristics"" (S2 Table).  Intervention/Exposure  The adherence of the MD will be defined with different scoring systems previously identified [4, 22, 23]. Both the earlier (e.g., Mediterranean Diet Score) and newer (e.g., Mediterranean Dietary Serving Score) MD scoring systems, as well as the more widely validated Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener, will be considered for the assessment of the MD [4].",1a2138b1-8af0-4f3c-9178-8ff64c400440
8,methods7,"  Outcomes  PF refers to the ability to perform daily activities with vigor, as well as the full range of physical qualities that have a relationship with health, such as aerobic capacity or muscle strength [24]. Based on a previous definition [25], PF outcomes for which data will be sought in this review include cardiorespiratory fitness, musculoskeletal fitness, and motor fitness. PF outcomes should be assessed by using standardized tests (e.g., 20-meter shuttle run test, 1.5-mile run/walk test, 12 minutes run/walk test, handgrip strength test, sit-and-reach test) in the general adult population [26].  Risk of bias in individual studies  Risk of bias will be independently assessed at the study level by two researchers using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies [27] and the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB2) [28].",db8d7201-513d-43d4-86b2-4db746f30714
9,methods8," In case of discrepancies that could not be resolved by discussion, a third reviewer resolved the disagreements.  Certainty of the evidence  The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach will be used for assessing the certainty of evidence and providing recommendations [29]. The GRADE method will be used involving five steps: 1) Assign an a priori ranking of ‘high’ to randomized controlled trials and ‘low’ to observational studies; 2) ‘Downgrade’ or ‘upgrade’ initial ranking; 3) Assign final grade for the quality of evidence as ‘high’, ‘moderate’, ‘low’, or ‘very low’ for all critically important outcomes; 4) Consider other factors that impact the strength of recommendation for a course of action; 5) Make a ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ recommendation [30].",78af1ebb-d84e-44ce-87b9-057730b86344
10,methods9,"  Synthesis of data  Once the main characteristics of the included studies have been extracted, higher vs lower MD exposures will be compared for each PF outcome, and these data will be synthesized narratively sub-grouped by sex, adult age group, and health status. Where a minimum of five studies addressing the same outcome have been identified, a meta-analysis will be conducted. Effect sizes (ESs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) will be calculated for each included study using Cohen’s d index [31]. If the included studies presented statistical adjustment models, the fully adjusted model will be selected. A pooled ES will be estimated using the DerSirmonian and Laird random effects method [32, 33]. The heterogeneity of results will be assessed using the I2 statistic, categorizing as not important (0% - 30%), moderate (30% - 60%), substantial (60% - 75%), or considerable (75–100%) (21). In addition, the corresponding p values and 95% CIs for I2 will be considered [34].",4b96cee6-56a8-4a9c-82f6-e091589a7bb2
11,methods10,"  If there is available information, subgroup analyses will be performed according to the characteristics of the population (sex, adult age group, health status), intervention (MD scoring systems, individual dietary components of the MD), and outcome (PF tests). Furthermore, the methodological quality of the included studies will be considered for the subgroup analyses.  Random-effects meta-regression analyses will be conducted considering potential main factors causing heterogeneity (e.g., sex, age, study design, body mass index, health status).  To evaluate the robustness of the pooled estimates and detect whether any specific study represents a large proportion of heterogeneity, sensitivity analyses will be conducted by eliminating the included studies one by one.  Finally, publication bias will be tested by visual inspection of funnel plots and using Egger’s regression asymmetry test [35].",3242d1aa-5dfa-4aa4-86bb-7917edf1f919

29,discussion0," This protocol describes the methodology that will be applied for the first systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizing the relationships between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) and health-related physical fitness (PF) levels in young, middle-aged, and older adults. Moreover, the systematic review will intend to provide evidence on the associations of individual components of the MD with PF indicators.  Available evidence indicates that MD is one of the healthiest dietary matrix patterns [36], and PF is an important marker of health in adults [37]. While systematic reviews analyzed the associations between MD patterns and PF levels during adulthood [38–42], they examined only older adults [41, 42], did not specifically analyze adherence to the MD [39, 40], reported results only for one component of PF [40, 42] and did not perform meta-analyses [38–40, 42].",c0c39c7d-492c-473c-a085-7e76b2238d13
30,discussion1," Furthermore, no previous systematic review analyzed the relationships between specific Mediterranean foods and PF levels.  To our knowledge, there are no systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have answered the following questions: Does the available evidence support a relationship between adherence to the MD and PF levels throughout adulthood (young adults, middle-aged adults, and elderly adults)? Which individual dietary components, in conjunction with MD adherence, are associated with each PF component? Since current global dietary transitions have become a growing challenge and public health problem during adulthood, this study may potentially have future implications for public health policies.  The limitations of the review may include the usual limitations of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, such as publication bias, low methodological quality, and heterogeneity of the included studies.",6b8933aa-42b5-4b40-984a-1d68f513363d

Conclusions  This study facilitates the protocol methodology for a systematic review and meta-analysis that will provide updated evidence on the associations between adherence to the MD and PF levels throughout adulthood. Findings from this review may be useful for researchers and health professionals responsible for adult lifestyle surveillance and health promotion.

40,discussion11," Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?  The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.  Reviewer #1: Partly  Reviewer #2: Yes  **********  2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?  The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable.",9c56f86b-74a1-4f78-a6f1-d462d4fe6f90
41,discussion12," As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.  Reviewer #1: Partly  Reviewer #2: Yes  **********  3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?  Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.  Reviewer #1: No  Reviewer #2: Yes  **********  4.",7f60c49c-5ea7-48d1-91ef-835d042c1ca5
42,discussion13," Have the authors described where all data underlying the findings will be made available when the study is complete?  The PLOS Data policy requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.  Reviewer #1: No  Reviewer #2: Yes  **********  5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?

44,discussion15,"  However, the manuscript is not suitable for publication as it seems to be a proposal work that was not formatted to meet journal manuscript requirement. The use of future tense in throughout the manuscript specifically in methodology gives evidence of this remark and raise important issue on plagiarism attempt. The methodology section must be fully rewritten and focus on important information related to results and address specifically what was exactly done to obtain the meta-analysis outcomes presented in this work. Most importantly, no results text is available in the submitted manuscript. Moreover, it is stated that “ the results of this research will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal” .  Abstract shall be written in past tense and shall summarize the research article. I suggest to rewrite the abstract and avoid exhausting methods description but rather providing rational, short description of the methodology, results and impact of the metanalysis review.
