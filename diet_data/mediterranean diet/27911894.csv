0,introduction0,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of vision loss and blindness globally[1]. Nearly all patients with type 1 diabetes and >60% of patients with type 2 diabetes will have some form of DR within 20 years of developing diabetes[2, 3]. With the rapidly increasing prevalence of diabetes worldwide, the prevention and management of DR has become a crucial public health concern[4].  Optimal nutrition forms a crucial component of overall diabetes care[5, 6]. While comprehensive dietary guidelines for overall diabetes management have been developed, these guidelines do not extend specifically to the prevention and management of DR[7, 8]. As such, DR-specific dietary recommendations for patients with diabetes at risk of development or progression of DR are not available. Several studies have explored the association between various dietary components and DR; they include micronutrients (e.g.",262285b9-5ece-4cf6-9e7a-2331ebb9d024
1,introduction1," antioxidants, sodium, vitamin D)[9–11], macronutrients (e.g. carbohydrates, proteins, fats)[12–14], food groups and beverages (e.g. fruit and vegetables, fish, coffee, tea)[15–18], as well as broader dietary patterns and characteristics (e.g. Mediterranean [Med] diet, total caloric intake)[10, 19]. However, findings remain inconclusive, and current evidence do not inform the specific dietary components which are likely to reduce (or increase) the risk of DR.  There are also few comprehensive reviews on diet and DR, with existing reviews mostly either focused on a specific nutrient or food group (e.g. alcohol, micronutrients)[20–22] or providing only a summary of the potential of the diet to influence DR pathogenic mechanisms. To our knowledge, there are no comprehensive review of the entire spectrum of dietary components and their association or effects on DR as a clinical outcome[23].",4cfc13f0-ce3b-4071-9292-41c45e915bd2
2,introduction2," To address this major clinical gap, we performed a systematic review on the associations between dietary intake and DR, with the primary goal of providing a comprehensive assessment of the existing knowledge on the topic. We also identified key knowledge gaps and suggest future research directions.  Methodology Literature search No existing protocol exists for this systematic review. We performed a systemic review and comprehensive literature search using four databases (PubMed, Embase, Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), with a date range of January 1967 to January 2017 with no language restrictions.",342d68ee-dacf-4521-b3e4-1430a14097fb

During preliminary searches, search keywords were initially based on similar reviews[24–27], which used broader generic dietary terms such as “diet OR dietary factors OR dietary intake OR consumption”. Furthermore, for an improved search comprehensiveness, additional specific dietary terms (such as “fibre” or “antioxidants”) based on areas our preliminary search found evidence of prior research, were included.

Studies were then systematically excluded after detailed examination, if the title and abstract were not relevant. The full-text articles of studies deemed potentially relevant were also obtained, particularly if there was insufficient information within the abstract for exclusion.

Participants. Studies involved on human participants with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or both.  Exposures (interventions). Exposures had to measure a form of dietary intake, either through standard dietary methods (validated food frequency questionnaire, 24 hr- dietary recall, dietary history etc.), general interviewer-administered questionnaires or estimations from biomarker levels (such studies had to use biomarkers as a means to estimate dietary intake levels; before using these final estimated dietary intake levels as the main exposure). Dietary intake included the consumption of specific foods and beverages, the intake of micro/macronutrients, and adherence to meal patterns (Fig 1). Selected studies also had to specify how dietary intake was measured and quantified.  Outcomes.",1a2a02e4-b979-46ba-85c6-6b7897504d68

We accepted studies using different DR assessment methods, including but not limited to: fundus photography with or without mydriatic eyedrops; fundoscopy; direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy; and fluorescein angiography. We also included studies using different scales to grade DR severity, including but not limited to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)) scale[29] or the International Classification system of DR[30].  10.1371/journal.pone.0186582.g001Fig 1 Overview of dietary components assessed in the studies included in our systematic review.

9,introduction9,"  Study quality evaluation The quality of observational studies was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS)), a validated tool for evaluating observational study designs[32]. Originally designed to assess prospective and case-control studies, an adapted version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used in the current study for the assessment of cross-sectional studies[33, 34]. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) uses three main bias-reducing criteria to award up to a maximum of 9 stars: (a) the selection and representativeness of the participants (maximum of 4 stars), (b) the comparability of groups (maximum of 2 stars), and (c) the ascertainment of exposure (for case-control) or outcome (for prospective and cross-sectional) (maximum of 3 stars).",a2e3cea1-a4a1-46fd-a225-e35a9b853588
10,introduction10," We also gave studies an additional star if they assessed dietary intake using validated dietary measurement tools, such as validated FFQs, or 24hr dietary record by dietician interviews, or if they estimated dietary intake from biomarker levels. Following previous reviews, studies assigned 0–4, 5–7, and ≥8 stars were considered as low, medium and high quality respectively[35–37].  For the evaluation of interventional studies (respectively[35–37] For the evaluation of interventional studies (RCT)), the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool was used, which measures risk of bias through seven criteria; sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, masking of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Each criterion is individually graded according to whether it is deemed to have a high, low or unclear risk of bias.",71bdbece-1509-4da4-aae8-5f3e9b8ea7eb

Importantly, the relationship between DR and several common dietary components including antioxidants, fatty acids, proteins, alcohol, and beverages, such as tea and coffee remained unclear, suggesting that more research, including longitudinal studies, are required to better understand these relationships. Our study may contribute to DR-specific dietary recommendation and complement existing DR management guidelines.

58,discussion1," Most fruits and vegetables are low-glycemic index foods rich in antioxidants and dietary fibre.[59] The ingestion of dietary fibres tends to modulate the postprandial glucose response[60], and is thus proposed to reduce glucose-induced damage to the retina[15]. Likewise, antioxidants are proposed to decrease oxidative stress in the retina[61], though till date there exists no clear association between antioxidants and DR (discussed later). Oily-fish is a rich source of Vitamin D and LCω3Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA)s, and it is proposed that the immune-modulatory and anti-angiogenic properties of these nutrients may play a role in the inhibition of DR[62–64].",9f1d0b26-2217-4358-9ca0-fb396c101631
59,discussion2," However, it should be noted that Millen and associates found the protective effects of oily fish on DR to be independent of LCω3Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) intake[9], suggesting these protective effects may stem from more than just the presence of LCω3Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA)’s in oily fish alone, with further research needed to confirm the exact underpinning mechanisms.  Our finding that a Med diet is protective for DR is similarly unsurprising as it is recognized as one of the healthiest dietary patterns[65–68], with several components of the Med diet, including olive oil, red wine, fibre and cereals proposed to alleviate pathogenic factors of diabetic microvascular complications such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance[69]. However, given that only one study has focused on the Med dietary pattern and DR, with relatively low number of incident DR cases (n = 74), our results should be interpreted with caution[19].",cc88d55c-4dea-4651-968c-dbac125cab8a
60,discussion3,"  Alternatively, our finding that a high total caloric intake may increase the risk of DR incidence and progression[10, 13] concurs with experimental and clinical evidence suggesting that higher caloric intake increases the metabolic burden and oxidative stress in persons with diabetes, and may increase the risk of developing DR in the oxidative stress-susceptible retina[70–73]. Interestingly, evidence unequivocally suggests that there is no significant association of increased carbohydrate intake, one of the key contributors to total caloric intake, with DR[10, 43]. In fact, two studies reported protective associations between carbohydrate intake and DR;[13, 14] however, these results should be viewed with caution, as they did not adjust for important confounders such as duration of diabetes, insulin use, the quality of carbohydrates (e.g. high vs low glycemic index).",69a9ac79-6c5b-4d48-9c47-eaf0274b48e0
61,discussion4," In spite of a lack of significant association with DR, the monitoring of carbohydrate intake is still important for improving postprandial glucose control in patients with diabetes[74]. However, greater focus on the quality of carbohydrates (consumption of low-glycemic index foods), and on reducing total caloric intake, may be more beneficial in preventing the development and progression of the disease[75, 76].  While prior experimental studies have suggested a protective association between antioxidants and DR[77, 78], we found a lack of consensus over the effects of Vitamin C, E and carotenoid intake on DR in humans, similar to a review by Lee and associates[22]. Additionally, while experimental studies have also suggested Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) intake to be protective against DR[79–81] through anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties[82], current evidence remains inconclusive[10, 12, 39, 45].",854f906a-4070-49fa-84e7-f13fc7d22021
62,discussion5," Our findings also support those of a recent meta-analysis by Zhu and associates that could not confirm a protective effect of alcohol consumption on DR[83]. While moderate alcohol consumption has been postulated to be protective of DR through multiple proposed mechanisms, including improving increasing insulin sensitivity[84] and decreasing platelet aggregability[21], such protective associations have only been reported in cross-sectional studies, with longitudinal studies reporting no clear associations. Lastly, research on the effect of popular beverages such as coffee, tea, milk[9, 17, 49] on DR remains limited, with only one study on each beverage, and no data available on the effects of soft drinks on DR. Given that the above dietary factors constitute a large component of diet, future large-scale prospective studies are warranted to elucidate their impact on DR incidence and progression.",9fe1d1e0-5648-4b04-b711-256e1046c719
63,discussion6,"  Our findings generally support existing American Diabetic Association (American Diabetic Association (ADA)) guidelines for overall diabetes management that acknowledge the beneficial effects of a Med diet[7], encourage people with diabetes to consume a diet rich in fruits and vegetables[7], and recommend lower caloric intakes[7, 8]. The American Diabetic Association (ADA) likewise states insufficient evidence for the benefits of antioxidant supplementation[74], or to recommend an ideal amount of protein intake[85] for diabetic individuals. For other dietary components however, while we found no conclusive evidence to suggest that increased sodium and carbohydrate intake have a detrimental effect on DR risk, the American Diabetic Association (ADA) still recommends patients with diabetes to monitor their sodium and carbohydrate intake[85].",aea49fba-8dd4-4864-8e71-edf1ef647e16
64,discussion7," Likewise, while the evidence for the effect of Mono Unsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA) / Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) intake, and moderate alcohol intake on DR remains inconclusive, the American Diabetic Association (ADA) does recommend Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA)s and Mono Unsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA)s as substitutes for saturated or trans fat[74], and also recommends moderate alcohol consumption[7] (should persons wish to drink) for patients with diabetes. The findings of our review are meant to complement and should be viewed in conjunction with the existing dietary guidelines for overall diabetes management.  While the majority of the studies included in our review had sound methodological and study qualities (with high Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) scores), there remain several restrictions in the current literature on the relationship between dietary intake and DR that limits our ability to derive more conclusive outcomes.",662f875e-aaef-4b07-9566-4753f03c1f89
65,discussion8," First, most studies used FFQs to assess dietary intakes, and these questionnaires were administered only once at study baseline. While FFQs are widely used as the primary tool of dietary assessment in epidemiological studies, they also have limitations due to recall bias, and subjectivity across individuals and time-frames[86]. Future studies using more objective measures of diet such as food consumption records or which collect data across multiple time-points will provide more robust measurements of dietary intake. Second, most studies are cross-sectional, which limits their ability to establish a causal relationship between dietary factors and DR. As such, more longitudinal studies are hence warranted. Third, most studies only assessed a single dietary component or nutrient, and did not consider a broader concept of dietary intake, which is often a combination of many meals, foods and nutrients.",ff393465-aa5f-420c-b33d-959f01ff4252
66,discussion9," Rather than continued focus on single nutrients, studies should also place emphasis on foods, beverages or even dietary patterns, to better reflect real world consumption habits which can be translated into clearer dietary guidelines[87, 88]. Forth, research regarding the impact of dietary intake on diabetic macula edema (DME) remains sparse, and future research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of diet in those with diabetic macula edema (DME) which may differ from DR. Lastly, it should be noted that many studies did not differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This is important because there are pathophysiological, etiological, epidemiological and disease management differences between diabetes types, all of which may influence on the effect of dietary intake on DR and diabetic macula edema (DME). Future studies should clearly identify diabetes types and provide specific data for each.  There are several strengths in our systematic review.",8e9d32ce-7140-4d8a-8526-e834083d4bb0
67,discussion10," Firstly, we sought to specifically evaluate dietary intake exposures and DR within human subjects, rather than including experimental, bio-mechanism or bio-marker studies, which allows for a more direct translation of results into dietary recommendations for patients. Secondly, as included studies were conducted on a wide variety of populations (over more than 10 different countries), this increases the generalizability of our results. However, there are also certain limitations to our study. For example, the methodological diversity across studies in assessing dietary intake exposures, and DR outcomes may affect their comparability. For example, studies using only fundus examinations, two-field or non-mydriatic fundus photography may have underestimated the number of DR cases, compared to studies using stereoscopic 7-field fundus photographs (the reference standard to detect DR as defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS))[29].",98ae7029-c825-4b68-af31-7c6af9f98c00
68,discussion11," We were also unable to conduct a formal meta-analysis to synthesize overall findings, as within each dietary component there were few studies sufficiently similar in design, outcome, and exposure measurements to be suitable for meta-analysis.  In conclusion, our systematic review demonstrates that diet can form a crucial aspect of DR prevention and management, with evidence suggesting that dietary fibre, oily fish, and a Med diet are protective of DR, while a higher caloric intake was associated with greater DR risk. These findings may enable clinicians to make evidence-based dietary recommendations when counseling patients with diabetes who are at risk of DR. However, further prospective studies and experimental models to untangle the effects of other key dietary components on DR, such as antioxidants, fatty acids, proteins, alcohol and popular beverages, are needed in order to better inform clinical guidelines.
