0,background0,"Diet and behavioural factors have crucial roles in the risk and progression of several chronic diseases including colorectal cancer (colorectal cancer (CRC)) [1]. Epidemiological studies on the role of a single nutrient or food items on disease outcome are often inconclusive, which may be in part due to dietary interactions, multi-collinearity [2, 3] and/or inability to detect small effects [4]. Dietary patterns are advantageous in nutritional epidemiology to explore the combined effects of total diet on health and to some extent, overcome these limitations [5]. Dietary patterns not only represent total diet or key factors of diet [6] and the frequency by which foods are habitually consumed, but also reflect an individual’s food preferences modulated by the combination of genetic, cultural, social, health, environmental, behavioural and economic determinants [7].  Data-driven and hypothesis-driven are two major approaches to identify dietary patterns [8].",a0fff6a6-6549-471a-acc1-151e48605560
1,background1," Cluster and factor analysis are outcome independent empirical data-driven techniques used to determine dietary behaviour in the study population, while index/score-based are hypothesis-driven based on adherence to prior recommendations or guidelines [9].  Briefly, cluster analysis (CA) divides individuals into mutually exclusive, non-overlapping groups based on mean dietary intakes (gm) [10]. Food intake common to all contributes less to cluster formation. Optimal clusters are formed by the maximum ratio of variance across the cluster to within the cluster. No gradient is formed hence comparison is done with the reference cluster. Factorial analysis, specifically Principal Component Analysis (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)), an exploratory approach, reduces a large set of correlated variables to smaller sets of non-correlated variables, which captures the majority of dietary variations within the study population.",393ab8a8-14ee-4bad-b2f1-8105ffff8988
2,background2," Linear combinations are created and each individual receives a score called factors [11]. A higher score represents higher adherence to the particular dietary pattern.  Recommended food score (Recommended Food Score (RFS)) [12] and alternate Mediterranean diet score (altMED) [13] are commonly used index-based dietary patterns for which scoring is based on the adherence to the US dietary guidelines and the Mediterranean diet, respectively. Dietary Inflammatory Index (Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)) differs to other index-based scales as it doesn’t directly measure the adherence to the established dietary guidelines; instead, it categorizes an individual’s diet into pro- and anti-inflammatory diet based on their dietary response to six inflammatory biomarkers [14]. For such indexes, patterns are derived from gradients, which are then compared to reference quartiles.  Dietary patterns are commonly used in epidemiological research.",90daa7e8-569c-4f18-bb1d-57e76f9f3312
3,background3," Studies on how outcome estimation may vary across these different patterns are limited and comparing across the patterns are recommended to better understand disease diet association [15]; however, such studies are limited. This study aimed to use different approaches to identify pre-diagnostic dietary patterns and evaluate and compare their association with the colorectal cancer (CRC) outcome (Overall Mortality (OM) and combined Mortality, Metastasis or Recurrence (cMRM)) using the Newfoundland and Labrador Familial Colorectal Cancer cohort.

A detailed description of the study population is published elsewhere [16]. Briefly, colorectal cancer (CRC) cases were followed from the date of diagnosis until April 30th, 2010. Overall Mortality (OM; the time between the dates of diagnosis to end of follow-up, or the date of death from all causes until the end of follow-up) and combined Mortality, Metastasis or Recurrence (cMRM; the time between the dates of diagnosis to the end of follow-up, or date of death, recurrence, or metastasis, whichever came first) were calculated.",da5be0ee-ba6c-4af1-886c-32b4fd25ac73

We conducted follow-up questionnaires with participants and linked records to death certificates, pathology reports, autopsy records, physicians’ notes, and surgical reports. Additional data were obtained from the Dr. H. Bliss Murphy Cancer Care Foundation [17]; many of the results can be mutually verified.  Data collection tools Participants completing the consent were asked to complete validated food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [18], personal history questionnaire (personal history questionnaire (PHQ)) and some further questions pertaining to family history and medical history.",11d9fdf1-e421-49cd-b12b-ccec7ad26c34
6,methods2," Briefly, the personal history questionnaire (PHQ) consisted of 74 questions including the history of bowel screening, medical conditions, use of medications, physical activity, intake of alcohol, tobacco use, socio-demographic information, and reproductive factors for females. Similarly, dietary intake data were collected using a 169-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) retrospectively a year before the diagnosis. For each food item, subjects were asked the frequency of food consumption (daily, weekly, monthly and never scales). Nutrient content was calculated using the Canadian Nutrient File, 2005.  MSI (Microsatellite instability) and BRAF have been associated with cancer prognosis and survival [19, 20]. P V600E BRAF mutation and MSI for the tumour DNA have been determined in a previous study using standard protocol [21]. MSI status was defined as MS high if 30% or more of marker were unstable and MS-stable/MS-low if less than 30% showed instability [22].",7dfb61d9-0d25-4a00-9b78-6eb352ac7049

8,methods4,"  Three patterns were identified using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) correlation matrix as the variables were on different scales. Briefly, exploratory principal component factor analysis was conducted using the same 39 predefined food groups. A varimax rotation (orthogonal) was applied to identify uncorrelated food groups. Factor Eigen-value greater than 1.15, the scree plot and proportion of variance explained were used to identify the number of factors. Patterns were labelled based on factor loading ≥0.5. The factor score of each participant was obtained by summing the intake of each food group multiplied by optimal weights and divided into quartiles. A higher factor score represents greater adherence to that particular dietary pattern. Factor loading and explained variances for three major dietary patterns are shown in Additional file 1: Table S3.

Each individual is given 1 point for each recommended food consumed at least weekly. Based on the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), the maximum score is 47. Total Recommended Food Score (RFS) score varies with the number of food items in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) [24]. A higher score represents better adherence to Recommended Food Score (RFS). Details are attached in Additional file 1: Table S4.  The altMED score is based on the Mediterranean diet scale [25]; scoring is based on 9 food groups. If the intake (servings/day) of a particular food group is greater than the median, then it is scored one (versus zero). For red and processed meat, reverse scoring is done. For alcohol, if intake is between 5 and 25 g/d, then it is scored as 1 (versus zero). The maximum altMED score is 9 with a higher score representing better adherence to the altMED diet.",6f5461e4-b9c8-43f3-b20a-f92764b96f88

Correlations between index scores were relatively strong and statistically significant as scores were based on similar food recommendations. An increasing score of altMED, Recommended Food Score (RFS) and a decrease in Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score are characterized by the higher amount of plant-based food [35].  Indexing systems vary in the definition of optimal diet quality and in their scoring which leads difference in their sensitivity to estimate the disease outcome. Differential classification of food leads to differential exposure.",a3e4fbed-1703-4629-8acb-4893406edd63
27,discussion6," Recommended Food Score (RFS) accounts for intake of vegetables, fruits, healthy protein sources, grains and dairy products but does not differentiate between different types of fatty acids or penalize for consumption of foods that are not recommended. Alcohol, energy dense food items and meat products are associated with survival outcomes as seen from empirical approaches but are not considered in scoring. Hence, Recommended Food Score (RFS) is likely to underestimate the true association. Further, in the Recommended Food Score (RFS) approach, energy cannot be adjusted so the effect of body size, physical activity and higher basal metabolic rate cannot be taken into account for the analysis [36]. Energy adjustment may also help to reduce measurement error [37]. AltMED scoring is based on high consumption of fruits, vegetables, non-refined bread and cereals, legumes and nuts, and moderate consumption of fish, poultry and alcohol.",2da4bd26-8580-414c-8684-efd481be2bf5
28,discussion7," High intake of red and processed meat and saturated fat is penalized during scoring [25]. Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score is based on the inflammatory potential of nutrient/food items in response to the six inflammatory biomarkers. Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) is relevant among those diseases associated with chronic inflammation [14]. Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) is not only limited to micro and macronutrients but also incorporates commonly used bioactive compounds including flavonoids, spices and tea. Since the current study was based on pre-diagnostic dietary pattern, dietary-induced inflammation may not have a significant role in the risk of mortality.  Multiple reasons could be suggested for the inconsistent results. First, several studies have suggested dietary guidelines have been more strongly related to coronary heart disease than to cancer mortality, even though guidelines are directed toward lowering cancer risk [38].",3fe48333-0136-4ef7-a7c3-f2e387349c95
29,discussion8," More extensive studies are done on diet-cardiovascular disease than cancer, and the role of dietary components in cancer causation is still unclear in many instances [29]. Second, dietary guidelines are more effective for cancer incidence than the survival (and therefore mortality) due to the other clinic-pathological factors in determining the cancer survival [38]. Third, the inconsistency might also be due to missing some important components, and some components in the scales may not have a significant association with the cancer risk and survival [29]. Also, our approximation of the three scales varied slightly than the original scale. Original Recommended Food Score (RFS) had 23 items and was developed for the all-cause mortality rather than cancer-specific mortality [12].",3ee0f399-e8e5-4ce0-89e6-84ae4c19736b
30,discussion9," Likewise, altMED score was developed to assess the variations in the biomarkers level [39] and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) index was based on 45 different food parameters whilst the current study had only 28 parameters [14].  Each method has its own strengths and limitations [6]. Empirical methods are an initial approach and identify dietary patterns as they exist in the population [40] and form the basis for index-based patterns, but suffer certain limitations: (a) They are based on eating behaviour rather than the biological plausibility hence the diet pattern may not exactly reflect disease causation theory [40]; (b) Even though an association is detected, it may not represent beneficial or detrimental eating patterns [41]; (c) Lacks limited reproducibility across the studies [4]; and (d) Includes several arbitrary decisions including consolidation of food items into food groups, number of factors/clusters, method of rotations and labelling of the patterns/clusters [42].",cf4307e3-4864-4c3b-aec4-bed74aaf1f67
31,discussion10," Index-based patterns are based on adherence to the recommendation or guidelines and the foundation of each scale varies. Index-based patterns are generally considered better at estimating the disease outcome as compared to empirical patterns due to their inclusion of relevant and evidence-based components [43]. Results tend to be reproducible across studies. They are limited, however, in that they do not capture a full range of diets in scoring [40] and are difficult to use when scores do not vary considerably within the population [6] and results vary with the cut-offs defined.  Strengths and limitations of study This is a prospective follow-up study.

First, the sample is relatively small, which may not offer desirable statistical power and precision in multivariate analysis. Further, cases were followed until 2010 only. Recall error and possible bias are likely to exist as the cases were asked to remember their dietary patterns a year prior to their diagnosis. However, we believe the recall bias, if any, could be non-differential, which is likely to attenuate the observed association. Although bias may exist and sample size is less, it may have little impact on cross-comparison, which is the primary focus of the study. Some cases might have changed their dietary patterns, lifestyle and behaviour after diagnosis or even in the disease induction/latent period; this may lead to possible reverse causation bias, which should be explored in future studies.",6c84752c-9d14-47dc-82e9-9e80d424e811

Only cluster characterized by refined grains, sugar, soft drinks had higher risk of OM (HR 2.05; 95% CI 1.18–3.57). All the diet indices showed similar null associations with both cMRM and OM except Poor adherence to altMED increased the risk of all-cause OM (HR 1.62; 95% CI 1.04–2.56). On the average estimates were higher for data driven methods than hypothesis driven.
