0,methods0," A literature search was conducted using databases PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest. The search focused on observational and clinical trials applying the MedDiet to various populations (with and without diabetes) and assessing outcomes associated with atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, vascular dysfunction, carotid intima-media and/or inflammatory markers. Selected articles were published from 2011 to 2021. Search terms included “Mediterranean and Atherosclerosis”, “Mediterranean, Atherosclerosis, and Diabetes”, “Mediterranean and Endothelial Dysfunction”, and “Mediterranean, Vascular Dysfunction or Carotid Intima-Media”. Filters were set to full-text, peer-reviewed articles published between 2011 and 2021, in English, and applicable to human adults, (≥18 years-old).",ad572d6a-58fa-4fd0-b391-77730c7b4067
1,methods1," With these filters applied, the search produced 648 articles, which were first assessed by their title and abstract, and secondly by MedDiet applications and outcomes related to atherosclerosis, inflammatory markers, artery calcification, and/or plaque presence (Figure 1). Articles whose title or abstract matched these criteria were then reviewed by examining their full text. Ultimately, 36 articles were eligible and included. All authors agreed on the inclusion of the articles.  Inclusion criteria included: (1) human subjects; (2) adults (≥18 years-old); (3) the application and assessment of a MedDiet; (4) measurement of atherosclerosis, inflammatory markers, artery calcification, and/or plaque presence.",79550d70-e2d4-4b49-8293-0293f3fea601

3,methods3," While most compounds have been thoroughly explored in the literature, meta-analyses and systematic reviews of dairy and its cardiometabolic risks have stated more Randomized Control Trials (randomized control trials (RCT)s) are needed to fully elucidate the benefits and risks associated with dairy and cardiovascular health [44]. For the scoping review results, 17 of the 36 total articles were randomized control trials (randomized control trials (RCT)) and 19 were observational studies.  3.1. Clinical Trials  The randomized control trials (RCT)s study populations ranged from 20 to 1139 participants with seven studies having less than 100 participants (Table 2). Study durations varied from two hours to 8.1 years with 10 studies lasting a year or longer and the remaining studies were less than four months. Seven studies included individuals who were at high risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and aged between 55–80 years old in men and 60–80 years old in women.",1c14b7ab-2e56-498c-accb-58b1a8ec0196
4,methods4," 13 studies included individuals with diabetes. For study locations, 12 studies were based in Spain, three in Italy, one in Poland, and one in Israel. Secondary studies were included in this section if the original studies were randomized control trials (RCT)s, which lead to many studies utilizing similar cohort populations.  3.2. Genetics  Among the randomized control trials (RCT)s we reviewed, four studies investigated if a MedDiet was associated with a significant change in genes related to inflammation and plaque stability [51,52,53,54]. The first study compared three dietary patterns over a nine-week period with each diet lasting three-weeks: a MedDiet, saturated fatty acid (saturated fatty acid (SFA))-rich diet, and a low fat, high carbohydrate (CHO-PUFA) diet.",61b35c02-522c-4355-8c2e-4f101f4d8e60
5,methods5," The genes studied were associated with inflammation and included nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor (tumor necrosis factor (TNF))-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) [51]. When compared to the saturated fatty acid (SFA)-rich diet, the MedDiet was significantly associated with a decrease in the expression of the p65 subunit of the NF-kB gene and a significant decrease in postprandial expression of the p65 subunit, MCP-1, and MMP-9and an increase in the IkBα subunit of NF-kB gene. When compared to the CHO-PUFA diet, the MedDiet was associated with a significant decrease in p65 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression and an increase in IkBα.  The second and third study utilized Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED)) data.",9676e949-46b8-41a1-9675-0175f33c1b4c
6,methods6," In the second study, participants were assigned to a MedDiet with extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) or nuts, or a controlled low-fat diet (low fat diet (LFD)) to study the following genes: Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, TLR6, caspase-1 (CASP-1), inflammasome (NLRP3), IL-receptor 1 (IL1R1), chemokine (C-C motif and C-X-C motif) receptors: CCR2, CCR5, CXCR2 and CXCR3 [52]. The results found no significant differences between the low fat diet (LFD) and the two MedDiets for any of the listed genes [54]. For the third study, the MedDiet with nuts was associated with a decline in gene expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), Caveolin 2 (CAV2), Endothelin (ET)-1 receptors (A and B) and the MedDiet with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was associated with a significant decline in gene expression of CAV2 and ET-Receptor B [53].",91879751-2d9d-4ecd-ab51-e54ebc63d819
7,methods7,"  The final study assessed how different alcohols in combination with either a MedDiet meal or a high fat meal would impact catalase (catalase (CAT)), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) expression after two hours of consumption. Overall, the MedDiet meal (alone) was associated with an increase in expression of the three genes, but the authors did not report that these increases were significant.  3.3. Biomarkers for Stress and Inflammation  Thirteen studies included measurements of the MedDiet and its impact on biomarkers for stress and/or inflammation. Six of these studies utilized the Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) cohort results. Two studies with the same first author investigated similar markers from the Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) study and compared baseline data to years 1 and 5, respectively [30,55].",8b2002c2-9452-46b7-ad3c-d44b4d91fe32

The authors used different circulatory markers for year 1 and year 5. For circulating marker changes between baseline and year 1, the authors found the MedDiet associated with a decreased in serum vascular cell adhesion molecule (vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)), serum intercellular adhesion molecule (intercellular adhesion molecule (internal carotid artery (ICA)M)), serum E-SEL, serum P-SEL, IL-6, CRP, IL-18, IL-18/IL-10 ratio and a significant increase in TGF-β1. From baseline to year 5, the MedDiet was associated with a significant decrease in MCP-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and hs-CRP. When comparing the MedDiet to the low fat diet (LFD), year 1 showed a significant reduction in monocyte CD40 only, but in year 5 significant reductions were found for all T-lymphocytes and monocytes.",31260dd5-2db3-458a-b745-3dc168951625
9,methods9," For circulatory markers, the MedDiet was associated with a significant decrease in serum P-SEL, IL-6, CRP, and IL-18/IL-10 ratio compared to the low fat diet (LFD).  Additional Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) secondary analyses included the following biomarkers: hs-CRP, IL-1β, IL1-receptor antagonist (RN), IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES/CCL5), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1β/CCL4), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10), and interferon gamma (IFN-γ), epithelial neutrophil-activating protein 78 (ENA78/CXCL5) and inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-total antioxidant capacity (TAC)/CXCL11), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (internal carotid artery (ICA)M)-1,",c4c6b35f-f6dd-4b27-aa36-8179b8a0e4ad

Overall, findings from these studies found significant reductions in hs-CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, MCP-1, RANTES/CCL5, MIP-1β/CCL4, ENA78/CXCL5, IFN-γ, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (internal carotid artery (ICA)M)-1, and serum ET-1 following a MedDiet [17,53,54]. Additionally, the MedDiet was associated with significant increase in serum NO [53].",141a4193-cbb0-49ba-b7fa-bfd16ab0c3ea
11,methods11,"  One study assessed multiple signaling pathways associated with the MedDiets from the Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) cohort and found MedDiets with either nuts or extra-virgin olive oil reduced hypoxia signaling in the cardiovascular system (cardiovascular system (CVS)), eNOS signaling, nitric oxide signaling in the cardiovascular system (CVS), renin-angiotensin signaling, aldosterone signaling in epithelial cells, P2 gamma purigenic receptor signaling pathway, and cardiac hypertrophy signaling [56]. Additionally, the MedDiet with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was associated with significant reductions of the following pathways: atherosclerosis, nitric oxide signaling in the cardiovascular system (CVS), angiopoietin signaling, renin-angiotensin signaling, role of nuclear factor of activated T cells in cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiac hypertrophy signaling [56].",4dca0451-20ad-4345-bb55-c4cb75bf5c47
12,methods12,"  For the six studies not associated with the Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) cohort, one study found a reduction in hs-CRP levels after following the MedDiet and controlled diet (Central European Diet). Additionally, no significant differences between these two diets were identified over time and no significant differences between groups for asymmetrical dimethylarginine (and no significant differences between groups for asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA)) were found [57].",c4001cbd-2561-49e4-9b8b-946eabc01c05
13,methods13," A second study discovered the MedDiet was associated with a significant reduction in isoprostane, lipoperoxides, nitrotyrosine, total microparticles (MPs), apoptotic endothelial microparticles (EMPs), activated EMPs, and a significant increase in ischemic reactive hyperemia, beta-Carotene, and percentage of endothelial progenitor cells (endothelial progenitor cells (EPC)) when compared to the two other dietary patterns, which followed a saturated fatty acid (SFA)-rich diet or a CHO-PUFA diet [58]. A third study found that compared to a low fat diet (LFD), the MedDiet is associated with decreased EMPs, reactive oxidant species (ROS), cellular apoptosis, senescence and increased cellular proliferation and angiogenesis [58]. This study also found when compared to the low fat diet (LFD), individuals experienced significant increases in percentage of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC)s and significant decreases in EMPs when following a MedDiet [59].",337ea24c-8098-426c-a0b9-89bee457d1ee

The fifth study identified a MedDiet with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) could prevent an increase in reactive oxidant species (ROS)-derived NOX2 activation and a reduction in vitamin E serum levels [61]. This study found a MedDiet with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) down-regulated NOX2 activation and thwarted serum vitamin E declines following a meal [61]. The final study conducted over a 3-month period in individuals with T2D found a MedDiet was associated with a significant decrease In CRP and intercellular adhesion molecule (internal carotid artery (ICA)M)-1 [62].  3.4.,623a4c13-bad7-4e67-b4ea-9446d90a889d
15,methods15," Blood Pressure, Lipids, and Anthropometric Measurements  Eight studies assessed the association between the MedDiet and blood pressure, lipid levels, and anthropometric measurements with four utilizing Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) data. The two related studies with the same first author found the MedDiet was associated with significant reductions in waist circumference (WC) systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)), diastolic BP (diastolic BP (DBP)), low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, total cholesterol (TC), Total: high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) from baseline to year 1 and significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, TC, Total: HDL-C, triglycerides (TG), weight (wt), body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), and WC from baseline to year 5 [30,55].",7f8b84cb-5dd0-470f-be95-91cb3ee699eb

The other two studies found significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, body mass index (BMI), and WC and a significant increase in HDL-C when participants followed a MedDiet compared to a low fat diet (LFD) [17,56].",abc5ccd2-35d5-4734-b004-503065ef66ba
17,methods17,"  The two studies not associated with the Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) cohort found the MedDiet was significantly associated with reductions in oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C when compared to a high fat diet and significant reductions in wt, WC, Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Sensitivity (HOMA-IS), TC, TG and systolic blood pressure (SBP) when compared to a low fat diet (LFD), which also found a significant increase in HDL-C when following a MedDiet compared to a low fat diet (LFD) [52,60]. A third study found no significant changes in body mass index (BMI), HbA1c, TC, and TG when following a MedDiet for 3 months compared to no intervention [62]. The final study identified a significant decrease in TC, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, and apolipoprotein B when following a MedDiet compared to a saturated fatty acid (SFA)-rich and low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet for 4-weeks each [58].  3.5.",2839cd76-eb54-4463-b6d3-e76b306c695b
18,methods18," Carotid Intima-Media Thickness, Flow-Mediated Dilation, and Plaque Height  Six studies investigated the relationship between a MedDiet and arterial health using measurements such as carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), flow-mediated dilation (flow mediated dilation (FMD)), and plaque height. Of the five studies, two utilized data from the Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) cohort, two utilized data from the CORDIOPREV cohort, and two studies were independent [18,59,63,64]. From the two Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) studies, one study found the cIMT decreased in the MedDiet arms when compared to the low fat diet (LFD) control group for adjusted models, but this decline in cIMT was only observed when the cIMT was greater than or equal to 0.9 mm [63].",0ece3c8c-77e1-4289-adf4-6598de713f58
19,methods19," For the second study, researchers identified the MedDiet with nuts was associated with a decrease in the average internal carotid artery (internal carotid artery (ICA))-IMT, the maximum internal carotid artery (ICA)-IMT, and maximum plaque height [64]. The CORDIOPREV studies found the MedDiet was associated with increased flow mediated dilation (FMD) when compared to a low fat diet (LFD); however, another secondary data analysis of the CORDIOPREV data found the MedDiet increased flow mediated dilation (FMD) in those with diabetes, but not in those without diabetes [18,59]. The fifth study investigated cIMT regression and progression in newly diagnosed T2D patients [60]. Their research found that individuals who were in the MedDiet arm had higher rates of regression and lower rates of progression for cIMT when compared to those assigned to the low fat diet (LFD) arm.",2e8159c5-6666-411e-b1a4-a4dc451b16c5
20,methods20," The final study also studied individuals with T2D and found a MedDiet compared to no intervention was associated with an increase in flow mediated dilation (FMD) percent [62].  3.6. MedDiet Adherence  Many of the clinical studies included in this review stem from similar cohorts. The Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) cohort is the most frequently applied cohort and has high adherence to the MedDiet. Overtime, the participants in the cohort increased their MedDiet adherence with mean baseline values around 9 and over years, it has increased to 11 points (out of a 14-point scale). While this is expected for those assigned to the MedDiet groups (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts), individuals assigned to the low fat diet (LFD) also saw an increase in MedDiet adherence. Similarly, individuals in the CORDIOPREV cohort also exhibited high adherence to the MedDiet.",1c3fc5a0-69fe-493c-aed6-d2c47ae86f2f

Observational Studies  Of the 19 observational studies, 15 were cross-sectional, 3 were prospective, and one was retrospective (7-day recall) (Table 3). The three prospective studies had study lengths of 1 year, 5 years, and 9.6 years. Only one prospective study included individuals with diabetes but did not have criteria listed as T1D or T2D, but used clinical measures, such as having blood glucose levels of ≥200 mg/dL, fasting glucose of >126 mg/dL, taking diabetes management medication, or a history of diabetes. Three cross-sectional studies included individual with diabetes with two following similar inclusion criteria of fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or taking medication for diabetes.

22,methods22," Biomarkers for Stress and Inflammation  Six studies investigated the relationship between biomarkers for stress and inflammation and the MedDiet [15,65,66,67,68,69]. The only prospective study included patients in databases for stroke, transient ischemic attack, and/or atherosclerosis over a one-year period and analyzed the relationship between higher adherence to a MedDiet and the following markers: trimethylamine N-oxide (trimethylamine N oxide (TMAO)), p-cresyl sulfate (p cresyl sulfate (PCS)), hippuric acid (HA), indoxyl sulfate (IS), p-cresyl glucuronide (p cresyl glucuronide (PCG)), phenyl acetyl glutamine (phenyl acetyl glutamine (PAG)), and phenyl sulfate (PS). Their results found no significant association between the MedDiet and these biomarkers.  The remaining five cross-sectional studies investigated the association between the MedDiet and various biomarkers in diverse populations.",4a9f2eca-47bb-432e-8e69-ec357da843b5
23,methods23," The first study was conducted in adults who were 20 years old and older with confirmed Familial Hypercholesterolemia or low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor variants and the results found hs-CRP was reduced in those who had the highest MedDiet scores [67]. The second study was conducted in healthy, normal weight adults between 18 and 50 years-old and investigated the association between MedDiet adherence levels (low, medium, and high) and circulating levels of trimethylamine N oxide (TMAO). The results showed a higher MedDiet adherence was associated with lower levels of trimethylamine N oxide (TMAO) [65]. The next study investigated the association between the MedDiet and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC)s and circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) in a predominately female group of nonagenarians [66]. The results found that a higher adherence to the MedDiet was associated with increased endothelial progenitor cells (EPC)s, but not CPCs.",8db9a485-ec71-42bb-a00c-38712b7c709d
24,methods24," The following two cross sectional studies were conducted in women only and found higher adherence to a MedDiet was not significantly associated with serum vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, serum intercellular adhesion molecule (internal carotid artery (ICA)M)-1, NF-κB and eNOS [68,69]. However, one study did find in young, healthy women a higher adherence to a MedDiet was associated with a reduction in serum E-selectin [69].  3.9. Insulin Measures, Lipids, and Lipoproteins  Three cross sectional studies investigated the association between a MedDiet and the following insulin measures, lipids, and lipoproteins: very low-density lipoprotein (Vlow density lipoprotein (LDL)), intermediate- density lipoprotein (intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL)), apolipoprotein-B (ApoB), low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, HDL-C, TC, TG, TG/HDL ratio, HOMA-IR, Lipoprotein Insulin Resistance (LP-IR) score.",4c7393de-c9c0-43d8-9f50-484043a79198
25,methods25," From these studies, the MedDiet was associated with reduced levels of ApoB, HOMA-IR, TG/HDL-C ratio [15,16]. However, one study found no significant associations between the exposure and any plasma lipids, lipoprotein particles, or lipoprotein particle sizes [70].  3.10. Plaque and Arterial Health  Thirteen studies examined the association between a MedDiet and plaque presence, progression, and overall arterial health. Two studies utilized the ankle brachial index (ankle brachial index (ABI)) to assess peripheral artery disease (peripheral artery disease (PAD)) in one group of healthy, 65+ year-olds and in a group of premenopausal women aged 45–54 with asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The first study found no association between a MedDiet and ankle brachial index (ABI); however, the second study did find a significant association between higher MedDiet adherence and normal ankle brachial index (ABI) range [71,72].",e49b5d26-2a71-4fed-98a3-94e1186eddd9
26,methods26,"  For cIMT measurement, two studies found no significant association with MedDiet and cIMT in study populations of adults over age 40 who were stroke free and adults (18+ yo) without diabetes, coronary heart disease or renal failure [16,73]. However, a study that enrolled 150 male patients with clinically stable congestive heart failure found a significant association between the MedDiet and cIMT [74].  Other studies examined the association between a MedDiet and plaque in specific locations (femoral, carotid, and iliac, for example), total plaque area (total plaque area (TPA)), and plaque thickness. In a study of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and atherosclerotic patients, the MedDiet was not associated with lower total plaque area (TPA) [67]; however, in individuals with no stroke history, the MedDiet was associated with a lower total plaque area (TPA) and lower plaque thickness [73].",d8a4ac83-6d49-4981-a15d-967f3bb039f9
27,methods27," Femoral plaque was inversely associated with higher MedDiet adherence in study populations of men between ages 40–55 and men and women free of clinical cardiovascular diseases (CVD) between ages 40–54 [75,76]. In the study of men and women between ages 40–54, the MedDiet was associated with lower plaque presence in general and plaque in the aorta, carotids, and iliac [75]. However, the men only study did not find a significant association with plaque in the carotids [76].  The MedDiet was significantly associated with the absence of CAC in three studies of only men between 40 and 55 years old, men and women between ages 40–54 free of clinical cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and men and women between ages 45–75 who were free of clinical CHD [75,76,77]. However, one multi-ethnic study of individuals between ages 45–84 did not find a significant association with a MedDiet and absence of CAC [78].  3.11.",3165c6c5-6aa8-49df-97e5-5ffcc67106e9
28,methods28," Subclinical Atherosclerosis Measurements  One study of men aged 40–55 and a second study of adults with HIV on antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 months found significant reductions in subclinical atherosclerosis but used different defining criteria. The male only study applied a CAC score of greater than 0 and the presence of plaques in any region (carotid, femoral, and/or iliac) while the adults with HIV study included a cIMT greater than or equal to 0.9 mm and presence of carotid plaques [76,79]. Additionally, in the study group of participants without diabetes, CHD, or renal failure, the researchers included a cIMT greater than or equal to 0.9 mm and presence of carotid plaques but found no significant association in their research [16].  3.12. Scoring Measures of Heart and Vascular Health  Four studies utilized scoring measures associated with arterial health and provided information about arterial calcification.",4dc79304-b775-4db6-82f0-7cb5599642cd
29,methods29," The first study found a significant inverse association between the MedDiet and Gensini score in a study population diagnosed with coronary artery disease (coronary artery disease (CAD)) between ages 35–80 [80]. The second study of individuals between 40 and 54 years-old found the MedDiet inversely associated with Agatston score [75]. The third study of adult, men with clinically stable congestive heart found higher adherence to a MedDiet associated with a decreased augmentation index and an increase in the systolic wave of tricuspid annulus [74]. The last study utilized specific criteria to identify early vascular aging (early vascular aging (EVA)) and normal vascular aging (normal vascular aging (NVA)) and found in adults without chronic conditions, the MedDiet was associated with a decrease in early vascular aging (EVA) and an increase in normal vascular aging (NVA) [81].  3.13. MedDiet Adherence  Overall, adherence to a MedDiet was moderate in most observational studies.",0d44fa14-23b5-4cdd-88d7-dbbe3bed6f79
30,methods30," Antoniazzi et al. reported 73.5% of the Spanish cohort were categorized in the moderate or strong adherence groups (7–14 points out of a 14-point scale) [15]. However, 83.7% of the Brazil cohort had poor adherence (0–6 points) [15]. Similarly, Gardener et al. found close to 70% of their cohort followed moderate-to-high adherence to a MedDiet [73]. Studies with low adherence were reported by Frölich et al., Gomez Sanchez et al., and the non-HIV group from Viskovic et al. [77,79,81].  4. Discussion  From clinical and observational studies, the MedDiet has been associated with beneficial changes in inflammatory gene expression, biomarkers of inflammation and stress, lipids, blood pressure, and anthropometric measures, as well as reduced presence and progression of CAC and other plaque measures. However, more information is needed as studies in this field are predominately from Mediterranean countries and similar cohorts.",3673f85b-83b2-4456-bcf4-f20b69d117cd
31,methods31," Additionally, some studies identified a similar decline in a risk factor and others would identify no change. For example, in CAC studies, two studies identified a decreased presence of CAC associated with the MedDiet while two studies did not have this association (versus an increased presence of CAC) [75,76,77,78]. These variations in results are likely due to differences in study design, population characteristics, and the large variations in outcomes. Furthermore, among the reported studies we reviewed, very few studies include individuals with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risks. Clinical studies were more likely to include individuals with diabetes; however, the studies were limited to similar cohorts and small sample sizes. Observational studies were less likely to include individuals with diabetes and were mostly cross sectional.  4.1.",7d092f2e-f03c-42a4-a641-6b537c4d8a16
32,methods32," Clinical Studies  As inferred from the clinical studies, a MedDiet has been associated with declines in T-lymphocytes, monocytes, circulating markers (such as CRP, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, EMPs, and multiple interleukins), blood pressure, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, and plaque measures. However, these significant reductions were primarily observed in the Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) cohort. Systematic reviews have supported similar findings of MedDiets associated with improved blood pressure and earlier clinical trials have found associations between greater adherence to the MedDiet and increased total antioxidant capacity, decreased oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, decreased oxidative stress, and reductions in inflammatory and coagulation markers linked with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [82,83,84,85].",3fa889e5-c997-4acb-8a55-8c8964a7610e
33,methods33," Researchers suggest these improvements in inflammatory pathways may be due to the high consumption of polyphenols in a MedDiet [86,87,88]. For individuals with T2D, researchers have also suggested the intake of polyphenols is beneficial for those with insulin resistance and T2D risk [87]. However, most authors conclude that more clinical research in diverse populations is still needed to substantiate these findings.  Major dietary characteristics of the MedDiet include long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish and nuts, polyphenols from fruits, vegetables, and wine, probiotics from yogurt and some milk products, and fiber, phytosterols, and antioxidants [89]. Animal models have provided some insights for associations between these dietary components and reduced risk factors associated with atherosclerosis development.",6ea92e96-c5b3-41d7-ad6e-7e57ea5b92bb
34,methods34," Researchers found hypercholesteremic, male rats whose diets were supplemented with omega-3s for 56 days reported an attenuation of an acetylcholine-induced response and improved the vascular function of hypercholesteremic rats to levels similar to normal rates [90]. Ethanol extracts from Garcinia mangostana L. peels (contain antioxidant mangosteen) were administered to white mice and were associated with a decrease in low density lipoprotein (LDL) through inhibitions of malondialdehyde formation and an increase in HDL cholesterol by preventing transfer of ester cholesterol from HDL to Vlow density lipoprotein (LDL) [91]. Additionally, probiotic-fermented camel milk was associated with a significant reduction in body weight, serum triglycerides, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) and an increase in serum HDL in obese, hypercholesterolemic rats [92].",022fb639-7a81-4701-9124-43430862b4f0
35,methods35," The MedDiet is a holistic diet, and these findings highlight how different components target biomarkers individually, as well as synergistic potential, and collectively change up and down regulation of atherogenic expression.  Clinical studies included in this scoping review were traditional randomized control trials (RCT)s with only three following a crossover design. One of the design limitations from these randomized control trials (RCT)s is study length. 10 of the 17 clinical studies were a year or less. While clinical measures, such as blood pressure, lipids, and biomarkers, exhibit improvements from dietary changes in the short term, longer study periods may provide more information about changes in risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) development especially those related to atherosclerosis and plaque development. Additionally, longer study periods may also provide information about the feasibility of the MedDiet particularly for populations outside of Europe.",ec24dbbb-0b5a-4eb7-a9ad-addba1f29b07
36,methods36," A second limitation of these studies is the study population size and location. As previously mentioned, eight of the 17 randomized control trials (RCT) studies were secondary analyses of the Prevención Con Dieta Mediterránea/Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) cohort. Depending on the research question, the size of the study population ranged from 34 to 1139 participants. More randomized control trials (RCT)s of diverse populations and larger cohorts are needed to increase power and reliability of the results. Lastly, the inclusion/exclusion criteria favored those who were older and at higher risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) with multiple chronic conditions.  4.2. Observational Studies  Based on the findings from the observational studies, a MedDiet was associated with lower presence of atherosclerosis, better vascular aging, and increased endothelial progenitor cells (EPC)s.",d85a11d2-d44e-4a9c-9e3f-bb083ba508d2
37,methods37," While clinical studies provide more evidence of cause-and-effect relationships, observational studies offer information about real life behaviors, but this can introduce more confounding and bias into the study [93].  Clinical studies have provided evidence for mechanistic and changes in biological pathways associated with the MedDiet; observational studies have provided information about compliance. In American cohorts, compliance to a MedDiet has been relatively low (25.0 points ± 8.21 for the Framingham cohort and 20.0 points ± 6.5 for Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (mean ± SD)) [10,94]. In comparison, over the last ten years, Mediterranean countries have reported moderate adherence to a MedDiet with most individuals falling in the moderate adherence category versus many falling into the low and high extremes like American populations [95].",7f1ac1c2-bb8c-4eef-b34b-e69933579ba7
38,methods38,"  Observational studies provide an opportunity to gain information about factors associated with adherence to improve health promotion and consequently health outcomes [95]. In this review, observational studies had more participants who were younger and healthier than clinical study groups, but many excluded individuals with diabetes. Additionally, 14 of the 19 studies included were cross-sectional, which can only provide information about prevalence and associations. To better understand the role of the MedDiet in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk factors, observational studies should include large, diverse cohorts that are studied over longer periods.  Clinical v. Observational findings. Within this review, clinical studies investigated and reported more information on genetics and biomarkers than observational studies.",abc2ce76-72c7-483d-8955-a833c7fb2bb1
39,methods39," Clinical studies included a more extensive list of diverse biomarkers associated with atherosclerosis development to include tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (internal carotid artery (ICA)M)-1, and several interleukins, which were not as extensively studied in observational studies. Overall, clinical studies reported significant reductions in the listed biomarkers, but in observational studies these were either not studied (no interleukins, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) or found to have no significant association with MedDiet scoring (vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule (internal carotid artery (ICA)M)-1). Observational studies, however, included more clinical measures of CAC, with most studies including cIMT measurements in their analyses—clinical studies reported more studies with flow mediated dilation (FMD).",7fcda8b8-ced4-41eb-b96a-22e81a80220a
40,methods40," Overall, clinical studies found the percentage of flow mediated dilation (FMD) to increase in individuals who followed a MedDiet and who were also either prediabetic or had T2D. Observational studies findings were mixed for CAC measures, which may be due to the high number of cross-sectional studies.  4.3. Strengths and Limitations  A major strength of this review is the identification of limited information about the applications of a MedDiet and atherosclerosis and its associated risk factors in individuals with and without diabetes. Based on randomized control trials (RCT)s and observational studies, the data provide a thorough evaluation of the MedDiet in the clinical and real-world situations. This diversity of data highlights differences in outcomes between the two settings. Secondly, the applied search criteria followed a strict set of guidelines. This allowed the current review to discuss the MedDiet in its entirety without focusing on single dietary components.",b4d194b1-0df7-45ba-aeb5-ef3ee5cc5a04
41,methods41," Additionally, the majority of observational studies had large sample sizes and the randomized control trials (RCT)s included individuals with diabetes. Lastly, an assortment of MedDiet patterns were included to show the diversity in its use and definition.  This review also experiences some limitations. First, this is a scoping review and does not follow the same rigorous methodology as systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Therefore, we did not conduct any statistical analyses on the data from the various studies and outcomes. The intentions of this review were to highlight the most current research findings that pertain to the application of the MedDiet and atherosclerosis as well as gaps in the research. Secondly, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest were the only platforms used during the literature search; however, these are major sources for health studies. Additionally, only articles written in English were included.",7b0e3270-caca-4d48-a578-470960b9c32b
42,methods42," Furthermore, while previously considered a strength, a limitation of the review is the lack of standardized calculation of the MedDiet, which has been a concurrent issue with the variation in application and calculation of the MedDiet in studies. Lastly, the number of observational, longitudinal studies was underwhelming along with limited inclusion of individuals with diabetes. These limitations identify the need for additional research into the potential benefits of a MedDiet over the long-term in individuals with and without diabetes in various global populations.  4.4. Future Directions  Many systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been conducted on the role of a MedDiet and reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), CHD, stroke, and MI [96,97,98]. Overall, the MedDiet has been associated with declines in these outcomes [96,97,98]. However, there are some key areas for future studies to address on this role of the MedDiet.",2e9c472f-0467-4dc1-b16d-2e485b268009
43,methods43," First, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), CHD, stroke, and MI are the clinical manifestations of advanced atherosclerosis. Future studies should assess the MedDiet’s ability to prevent atherosclerosis development, advancement, and if the MedDiet can reduce atherosclerotic plaque over time. Secondly, many studies use T2D as an outcome measure, but for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and associated outcomes, individuals with diabetes (T1 and T2) should be included in these studies due to their increased risk of death from cardiovascular diseases (CVD). On average, individuals with T1D have had to monitor and live with the disease longer than individuals with T2D [99,100]. Therefore, proven dietary interventions which prevent premature death from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and assist in insulin management may be a more feasible option for this at-risk group.",3ec5559d-74a5-4522-bbad-a5f006041090
44,methods44," Additionally, wine is often contradictory in the literature, but is a component of the MedDiet associated with cardiovascular health benefits. It would be worth exploring how varying ethanol concentrations, frequency, and volume (in the context of the MedDiet) may impact individuals differently based on diabetes and hypertension status and in different racial groups. Lastly, future studies should consider utilizing MedDiet dietary patterns and calculations that measure adherence to a MedDiet while considering food components which do not adhere to a MedDiet, such as the pattern created by Rumawas et al. [10]. This will be particularly important in non-Mediterranean populations as many MedDiet calculations only assess components which align with the MedDiet and do not include those which are not aligned.",c377afdf-5c6e-4f94-bb35-ffea604d164b
45,methods45," Once overall adherence to a MedDiet has been established, future studies could investigate dietary substitutions, which may provide similar benefits as the MedDiet, but are more applicable to different geographical locations and populations [101].  5. Conclusions  The current review is a critical analysis of 36 studies. The aim of this review was to present the most recent clinical and observational study findings pertaining to the MedDiet and atherosclerosis and associated risk factors with a secondary emphasis on inclusion of participants with diabetes. Clinical studies investigating the MedDiet have provided significant results for improved biomarkers, plaque, and anthropometric measurements that are associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, these studies are predominately from Spain and Italy as well as similar cohorts.",24977372-34dd-44b8-ba00-f639c0b60071
46,methods46," Observational study results were associated with lower presence of atherosclerosis, improved vascular aging, and increased endothelial progenitor cells (EPC)s, but most of these studies were cross sectional and fail to provide more information about long-term dietary habits. Further research is needed to better understand the long-term effects the MedDiet on atherosclerosis and its associated risk factors, and such studies must include individuals with different forms of diabetes, as well as matched controls without diabetes.
