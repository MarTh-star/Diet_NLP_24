0,introduction0,"Malnutrition is widely spread worldwide, presented in diverse forms from undernourishment in people without access to minimum diet requirements, to people with access to processed foods rich in fats and sugars, dramatically increasing diet-related chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases . Hence, there is a growing interest to improve food nutritional value in order to fulfill minimum requirements, as well as to prevent diet-associated diseases.  The Mediterranean's diet consists of a largely plant-based dietary pattern associated with the low incidence of coronary heart disease, certain cancers and other diet-related illnesses, including obesity and diabetes (Stafford, 1990; Gates et al., 2009). Its composition includes legumes, nuts and olive oil, making it markedly different from the Western-diet rich in saturated fatty acids derived from animal food (Trichopoulou and Vasilopoulou, 2000; Wahrburg et al.",b261a751-3b64-4d48-8052-58437d56c52c
1,introduction1,", 2002). However, many components of the Mediterranean's diet are inaccessible or have a high cost, making other plants and plant-derived foods containing similar nutritional components potential targets to bring about improved nutritional value .  Maize is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide, with the USA being the top producer. In order to satisfy the demands of a rapidly increasing population, most of the maize grown for feedstock, bio-ethanol and other industrial purposes are high-yield varieties grown at high densities. Additionally, to increase production, more efficient food processing methods have been developed (Morris and Sands, 2006). In order to fulfill these requirements, breeding has generated maize varieties that have looser husks, bigger endosperms, thinner pericarps and which have lost many of the phytochemicals important for plant protection, human and livestock nutrition (Bailey and Bailey, 1938; Huang et al., 2002).",6972421d-79ef-4390-b045-b784ff2c3db0
2,introduction2,"  Amongst the phytochemicals lost during maize domestication and breeding are the flavonoids, plant specialized metabolites that play many important roles in plant growth and development, including pollen development and viability, UV protection, and insect pest deterrence (Grotewold, 2006; Falcone Ferreyra et al., 2012). Flavones, a flavonoid sub-family, have been associated with the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet. Specifically, the flavone apigenin, abundantly present in celery, parsley and other vegetables of the Mediterranean's diet (Justesen et al., 1998; Trichopoulou and Vasilopoulou, 2000), exhibits potent anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic activities (Vargo et al., 2006; Gonzalez-Mejia et al., 2010; Shukla and Gupta, 2010). Moreover, apigenin restores normal metabolic function during inflammatory conditions, through the regulation of mitochondrial function .",5f992d77-c924-4b9c-a6f2-79e62dd5df58
3,introduction3," The identification of human cellular targets of apigenin provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which this flavone exerts its beneficial effects. Apigenin binds to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNPA2) and affects its multimerization, thereby inducing changes in splicing activity . Flavonoids have also been identified as potentially beneficial for feedstock nutrition, for example by reducing ruminal methanogenesis, by altering meat and milk fatty acid profiles, and by reducing lipid peroxidation in meats (Patra and Saxena, 2010; Vasta and Luciano, 2011).  Flavonoid biosynthesis begins with the condensation of three malonyl-CoA molecules with p-coumaroyl-CoA by chalcone synthase [abbreviated CHS, encoded by the colorless2 (C2) locus], to form naringenin chalcone.",4965e710-7dad-4947-b0af-697b96533d42
4,introduction4," Subsequently, chalcone isomerase (chalcone isomerase (CHI)) converts narigenin chalcone into the flavanone naringenin, generating a key branching step in the pathway (Winkel-Shirley, 2001; Grotewold, 2006). Naringenin can serve as substrate for the flavanone-3′-hydroxylase enzyme, encoded by the locus Pr1, to generate eriodictyol. Naringenin is then converted into various flavones by a combination of steps involving a flavanone-2-hydroxylase (F2H) and a C-glycosyl transferase (C glycosyl transferase (CGT)), to generate apigenin-6-C-glucoside (or its isomer, apigenin-8-C-glucoside), also known as isovitexin and vitexin, respectively. In the case of eriodictyol, the flavones generated after these conversions steps are luteolin-6-C-glucoside (or its isomer, luteolin-8-C-glucoside), namely isoorientin and orientin, respectively (Winkel-Shirley, 2001; McMullen et al., 2004; Morohashi et al., 2012; Falcone Ferreyra et al., 2013).",104c79f9-8639-43d1-8a71-144e42ac3a0f
5,introduction5," Flavones can also be generated from naringenin by means of a 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase (2-ODD), as is the case for Apiaceae like celery . Flavones are often O- or C- glycosylated by glycosyl transferases, to generate, for instance, apigenin-7-O-glucoside (A7OG, Figure 1).  Figure 1 Proposed maize flavone and 3-deoxy flavonoid biosynthetic pathways. Condensation of p-coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA by chalcone synthase (referred to as CHS, encoded by the locus C2) results in naringenin chalcone, which is then converted to naringenin by chalcone isomerase (chalcone isomerase (CHI)). Naringenin is converted to apiforol (flavan-4-ol) by a dihydroflavonol reductase (dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR), A1) and subsequently polymerized into phlobaphenes. It can also be converted to isovitexin (C-glycosylflavone) by a flavanone-2-hydrohylase (F2H) and a C-glycosyl transferase (C glycosyl transferase (CGT)).",ea29f611-5a46-4190-9950-4ac22a66e4d3
6,introduction6," A flavone synthase (flavone synthase (FNS)) could also catalyze this step followed by an O-glycosyl transferase (O glycosyl transferase (OGT)). Naringenin can also be converted to eriodictyol by a flavanone-3′-hydroxylase (F3′H, Pr1). The proposed steps for conversion of apigenin and luteolin into the C-glycosylflavones apimaysin and maysin respectively, involve at least three enzymatic conversions: glycosylation at C-6, followed by a rhamnosylation and dehydration steps mediated by the Sm2 and Sm1 loci (adapted from Morohashi et al., 2012). Enzymes identified in black, those proposed in gray.  The R2R3-MYB transcription factor PERICARP COLOR 1 (P1) controls the accumulation of the brick red phlobaphene pigments in the pericarp (Styles and Ceska, 1977; Grotewold et al., 1991b) the outermost layer of the kernel, a maternal tissue that corresponds to the modified ovary wall (Kiesselbach, 1949).",499d29bb-a4c3-495b-a449-2610acd3ae64
7,introduction7," Phlobaphenes are polymers of the flavan-4-ols apiforol or luteoforol, generated from naringenin or eriodictyol by dihydroflavonol reductase (dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR)), encoded by maize A1. Different P1 alleles specify different pericarp and cob glume colors. For example, P1-ww results in white pericarps and white cob glumes, whereas P1-rr specifies red pericarps and red cob glumes (Figure 2). P1-wr and P1-rw alleles responsible for white pericarps and red cobs, or red pericarps and white cobs respectively, have also been described (Anderson, 1924; Chopra et al., 1996). A1 mutants in a P1-rr background (P1-rr;a1) display an unidentified brown pigment that contrasts with the white P1-ww pericarps, suggesting metabolic shunting toward a different branch of the flavonoid pathway (Styles and Ceska, 1977).",3381c4a0-1599-4bd4-b9da-e0f2479e1a8f
8,introduction8," Additionally, P1 has been identified as a major QTL for C-glycosylflavone accumulation in maize silks; in the absence of a functional A1 allele, P1-rr pericarps accumulate C-glycosylflavones (Styles and Ceska, 1977; Byrne et al., 1996). Most commercial high-yield hybrid maize lines are colorless in the pericarp and lack flavones. As is the case for sweet corn and other commercial varieties, maize kernels contain over 25% sugar , resulting in maize being partially responsible for the poor nutritional value combined with high caloric intake of many processed foods. For example, high fructose corn syrup has been associated with high incidence of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, kidney damage and liver disease .

Arbitrary units correspond to total peak area at 350 nm per g of dry pericarp.  As a first step toward a rational strategy to increase the nutritional value of maize-based diets, we investigated the accumulation and chemical properties of flavones in defined maize genotypes. We show here that the pericarps of P1-rr maize accumulate flavones at levels comparable to those present in flavone-rich vegetables. We found that a significant portion of these flavones is present as C- and O-glycosylated derivatives. We describe strategies that permit the conversion of some of these glycosides into the more bioactive aglycones in a whole food context. The levels of flavones in various maize lines, including P1-rr;a1, were also quantified.",91d2ce90-f5be-4cb7-9fec-5fa4f7c78763

11,methods0,"Maize stocks and plant materials The P1-rr 65-CFS-305 and P1-ww 4Co43 lines were introgressed into A619 (P1-ww) as previously described . The P1-rr;a1 stock has the P14B−2 allele into which the a1::rd-t sh2 mutant allele was introduced by crossing (Grotewold et al., 1991a; Pooma et al., 2002). It is not known however, whether the A1 allele in the P1-rr 65-CFS-305 line is the same as in P1-rr;a1. It was also noted that the kernel and ear sizes from P1-rr;a1 were smaller, compared to those of the other lines in this study. In all cases, pericarps and whole kernels were collected at different developmental times including 14, 25, and 40 days after pollination (days after pollination (DAP)) and saved at −80°C for further analyses.

Maize whole-food extract preparation Maize extracts were prepared as similarly described . Briefly, kernels stored at −80°C were macerated with mortar and pestle and incubated for 3 h at room temperature, subsequently frozen in liquid N2 and lyophilized overnight. Kernels were incubated for 3 h following the same protocol as previously used for celery , which was used as a positive control for extract preparation. The lyophilized material was ground, re-suspended in 1.5 N H3PO4 (at 1 gr per 17 ml) and boiled for 90 min, before neutralizing with 10% KOH.

18,results0,"Kernels of P1 expressing maize lines have high flavonoid content Flavonoid content was evaluated in pericarps of different maize lines including P1-rr, P1-ww, P1-rr;a1 and commercial sweet corn, at three different developmental stages: 14 days after pollination (days after pollination (DAP)), a developmental point close to the milky stage, when corn is normally harvested for human consumption, 25 and 40 days after pollination (DAP), the latter time corresponding to a stage used for long-term seed storage or livestock feed. We found that the majority of the flavonoids analyzed had very short retention times ranging from 1.8 to 4.8 min by HPLC (Supplementary Figure 2) and most likely correspond to glycosides . P1-rr;a1 showed the highest amount of total flavonoids, as compared with P1-rr, P1-ww and sweet corn (Figure 2), in agreement with previous studies (Styles and Ceska, 1989).",2ad67f76-f301-44ae-bc66-989cfa6c10de

Finally, at 40 days after pollination (DAP), P1-rr;a1 levels dropped to 5.6 × 109 AU whereas the levels of P1-rr were 1.5 × 1010 AU and P1-ww 1.0 × 109 AU, respectively (Figure 2).

20,results2,"  Flavones are present primarily as C- and O-glucosides in maize kernels To identify the contribution of flavones to the absorbance observed at 350 nm in the various maize genotypes, liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed on pericarp extracts of the various maize lines at 14 and 25 days after pollination (DAP) and in sweet corn at milky stage (shown in Figure 3 for apigenin). P1-ww and sweet corn kernels showed the lowest levels of total flavones, ranging between ~0.6 −1.3 μg flavones per 100 gr fresh kernel respectively (Table 1), consistent with the results obtained by HPLC (Figure 2). P1-rr accumulated 360 and 71 μg of total flavone per 100 gr of fresh kernel at 14 and 25 days after pollination (DAP), respectively.",6ccef81a-3428-419b-ba9d-b31bd6934e77

We found that in all the lines, flavone content decreased during development. This is likely a consequence of the diversion of naringenin toward flavan-4-ol formation, which will polymerize into phlobaphenes in P1-rr, or into the brown pigment in P1-rr;a1, as pericarp development continues.

Unexpectedly, we found that apigenin and luteolin were similar in P1-rr and P1-ww or sweet corn at both developmental stages (Table 1). The difference between apigenin and luteolin levels at both developmental stages in P1-rr;a1 could be explained by the presence of the Pr1 locus, encoding a flavanone-3′ hydroxylase , responsible for adding a hydroxy group to C3 on the B-ring of the flavonoid backbone (Figure 1).  Apigenin-7-O-glucoside (A7OG) and luteolin-7-O-glucoside (L7OG) contents were similarly low in P1-ww and sweet corn (Table 1).",c7b2cde6-229a-4801-bdb9-815cc8c8369d

In contrast, increased levels are observed in both P1-ww and sweet corn (0.2 and 0.4 μg/100 gr fresh weight at 14 days after pollination (DAP); blue boxes in Table 2). If the acid hydrolysis would have been complete, A7OG and L7OG should have disappeared from the hydrolyzed samples, or their levels should have been significantly reduced, which is not always the case (Table 2). It is possible that we misidentified A7OG and L7OG. However, we do not think that this is likely because we used pure commercial standards for these two compounds, which show over a minute difference in their retention times, and they present different parental/daughter ion combinations (Supplementary Table 1). Alternatively, it is possible that the hydrolysis was not complete, despite the strong conditions used.",c855b8ec-c750-4f04-868e-f31c6e766654
30,results14," The increase in both flavone glucosides with hydrolysis can be explained by a more decorated flavone, perhaps not present among the ones studied here (Table 1), being partially hydrolyzed into A7OG or L7OG. This is consistent with the significant increase in isoorientin after hydrolysis; none of the flavones described in Table 1 was found to be high enough in sweet corn to provide the levels of this C-glycosylflavone (7 μg/100 gr fresh weight) found after hydrolysis (Table 2).  L7OG decreases by ~7 and 2.5 fold at 14 and 25 days after pollination (DAP), respectively in P1-rr;a1 (Tables 1, 2). However, in P1-ww and sweet corn, L7OG shows an increase of ~10 fold at each developmental stage (0.5 and 0.2 μg/100 gr fresh weight at 14 and 25 days after pollination (DAP), respectively). In P1-rr, L7OG levels increase ~3 fold at 14 days after pollination (DAP) and 6 fold at 25 days after pollination (DAP) (Table 2, gray boxes), reaching 8 and 4 μg/100 gr fresh weight, respectively.",8f91dc51-fbd5-491c-8b23-052793d643a1
31,results15," Hydrolysis increases the levels of the apigenin C-glucosides vitexin and isovitexin in all the samples, at both developmental stages (Table 2). P1-rr shows the highest levels at 14 days after pollination (DAP) (89 and 84 μg/100 gr fresh weight) corresponding to a 10-fold increase (Table 2, gray boxes and underlined values), and the increase was even larger (~15 fold) at 25 days after pollination (DAP) (Table 2 gray boxes and underlined values), reaching ~23 μg/100 gr fresh weight for both compounds. Vitexin and isovitexin levels also increase during hydrolysis, but to a lower level in P1-rr;a1 at both 14 and 25 days after pollination (DAP) (Table 2, gray boxes and underlined values), resulting in 2–4 fold differences, when compared with the non-hydrolyzed material (Table 1). In P1-ww, at both developmental stages as well as in sweet corn, the levels increase, but remain always significantly lower than in P1-rr and P1-rr;a1.",c392eb33-0256-4580-84d6-7ff448220e09

The highest levels of isoorientin are found in P1-rr;a1, reaching 11 and 12 mg/100 gr fresh weight, at 14 and 25 days after pollination (DAP), respectively, corresponding to a ~8 fold increase. In P1-rr, isoorientin increases 60 fold (600 μg per 100 gr fresh weight) at 14 days after pollination (DAP) in contrast to a 110 fold increase (240 μg per 100 gr fresh weight) at 25 days after pollination (DAP) (Table 2, orange boxes).

33,results17," Overall, these results suggest that additional O-glycosylated flavones, products of alternative metabolic pathways likely not controlled by P1, may be present in these lines (see Discussion).  Maize whole-food extract preparations increased flavone aglycone content We previously showed that flavone aglycones have more anti-inflammatory activity than their glycosides counterparts . Hence, to evaluate whether food processing could increase the aglycone content in maize foods, we prepared whole maize extracts from kernels of the various genetic stocks using acid extraction [referred as AME (acid treated maize extracts)], or acid extraction combined with almond powder [referred as EME (enzyme treated maize extracts)], which we previously reported provides β-glucosidase activity, thereby increasing aglycone accumulation (Figure 5A) (Hostetler et al., 2012, 2013). Whole food extracts from P1-rr showed the highest apigenin content, reaching ~77.",8d49b8e5-c873-45e8-88e1-40be8e94d412

The almond powder contributes with negligible amounts of apigenin, as determined by HPLC analyses (1.4 μg/100 gr fresh weight) (Supplementary Figure 3). Both AME and EME foods from P1-rr;a1 contain significant less apigenin, ranging from 10 to 16 μg/100 gr fresh weight, respectively (Figure 5, Table 3).

Surprisingly, P1-ww AME foods have 23.9 μg/100 gr fresh weight of apigenin, increasing 5 fold to ~103.9 μg/100 gr fresh weight in EME preparations (Figures 5B,C). In contrast, sweet corn accumulates the lowest amount of apigenin in both AME and EME (~2.0 and 8.2 μg/100 gr fresh weight for each formulation respectively, Table 3). Collectively, these results suggest that preparations of foods using maize lines with increased flavone content significantly enhance the concentration of anti-inflammatory forms of flavones lacking in commercial sweet corn.

36,discussion0,"In this study, we show that maize lines harboring the P1-rr allele in combination with recessive a1 accumulate flavones at levels comparable to those present in celery, a vegetable often associated with the beneficial effects alleged to the Mediterranean's diet, and which is often presented as apigenin-rich . Moreover, maize offers great advantages including the absence of other toxic compounds such as the linear furanocoumarins (e.g., psoralen, bergapten) that characterize celery, parsley and many of the other flavone-rich Apiaceaes and that can result in skin disorders, including cancer (Beier and Oertli, 1983; Diawara et al., 1995; Nigg et al., 1997). The ability to increase flavone content in crops of high agronomic relevance such as maize furnishes unique opportunities to improve nutrition.",423d5792-55c8-4f4c-965c-da580d24b92c
37,discussion1,"  At 14 days after pollination (DAP) in P1-rr and P1-rr;a1 maize kernels, about 95% of all the flavones investigated here are present in the form of C-glucosides, 3% as O-glucosides and less than 0.1% as aglycones (Table 1). A number of biological activities have been attributed to C-glycosylflavones , including anti-diabetic, potential anti-Alzheimer's disease, and anti-inflammatory activity, although aglycones are significantly more effective for the latter. Moreover, the economical value of C-glycosylated flavonoids is in the rise, as organic chemists are increasingly using these compounds as scaffolds for the generation of bioactive compounds because of their high biological activity potential (Talhi and Silva, 2012). However, it is not known to what extent C-glycosylflavones will be absorbed by the digestive system, or to what level gut microorganisms are able to process these compounds (Courts and Williamson, 2013).",441238d0-86e9-436e-8044-386655834194
38,discussion2," In contrast, O-glycosylflavones are readily processed by the gut microbiota and are capable of releasing the respective aglycones (Courts and Williamson, 2013). In addition, during food processing, particularly when using combinations of whole foods rich in glycosidases, an abundant release of the aglycones is observed (Figure 5). As previously noted, functional foods with increased aglycone content provide higher anti-inflammatory efficacy and increased absorption of flavonoids in vivo .  While the pericarp is part of the grain consumed as sweet corn, canned corn, and popcorn, it is eliminated by nixtamalization during the preparation of cornmeal for tortillas, tortilla chips and tamales. P1-rr kernels accumulate significantly larger flavone quantities than most lines commercially used, and the increase in free flavone and flavone O-glucoside accumulation in P1-rr;a1 offers attractive opportunities to further increase maize nutritional value.",ba8fe054-1628-43f9-bd7d-6b476f8ee6cb
39,discussion3," The absence of the dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) enzymatic activity in P1-rr;a1 lines diverts the naringenin intermediate toward flavone formation (Figure 1). Although a significant portion of the total flavones is used in the formation of C-glycosylflavones, a significant portion is utilized for the formation of flavone O-glucosides (Table 1), which can be hydrolyzed to the respective aglycones (Table 2). It is noteworthy, however, that hydrolysis did not completely eliminate the flavonoid O-glycosides (Table 2), something that was particularly puzzling in the case of P1-ww and the sweet corn line, in which the quantities of the flavones present fail to explain the levels observed after hydrolysis (Tables 1, 2). This likely indicates that there are a number of other flavone glycosides present in these maize lines that we failed to detect with our targeted MRM approach that could be identified through untargeted metabolomics analyses.",9ee9992a-832b-4281-83a9-84b7271698f7
40,discussion4," A large number of flavones (more than 28, including apigenin, apigenin-8-C-glucoside, vitexin and A7OG) were recently identified in a genome-wide association study of kernels from a large number of maize inbred lines using untargeted metabolomics . Perhaps one of these other flavones is responsible for the formation of small quantities of A7OG, L7OG, and isoorientin after hydrolysis. Additional studies will be required to determine if this is the case. There are multiple ways in which consumers could benefit from immature (14–20 days after pollination (DAP)) high-flavone corn kernels, once the appropriate stocks are in the market, for example as popcorn, sweet corn, and canned corn. However, our studies also start providing some possible paths forward to introduce combinations of mutations that might significantly increase the accumulation of flavone in mature, dry kernels.",fce032e0-6657-4019-83f8-b36984c8dee1
41,discussion5," Salmon silk (Sm) genes (Anderson, 1921) are required for the formation of the major C-glycosylflavones present in maize floral organs . Presumably, the combination of a1 and sm mutations in a P1-rr background will provide a further opportunity to increase the accumulation of hydrolyzable flavones in the maize kernel.  As previously shown in rice and wheat (Brazier-Hicks et al., 2009), and more recently in maize , the formation of C-glycosylflavones involves hydroxylation of a flavanone to a 2-hydroxyflavanone by F2H, which can then be C-glycosylated (Brazier-Hicks et al., 2009; Falcone Ferreyra et al., 2013). This poses the question of how apigenin or luteolin are formed, which presumably serve as the substrates for the respective O-glycosides. We speculate that there is a bona fide maize flavone synthase that can use naringenin (or eriodctyol) as substrates to form apigenin (or luteolin).",fcc90003-a634-4c0b-a796-efc6b8cba21c
42,discussion6," Indeed, such an enzyme might not be significantly controlled by P1, since the levels of apigenin in P1-ww and P1-rr are comparable (Table 1). To determine to what extent the genes encoding the enzymes necessary for the formation of the flavanones are expressed in P1-ww, we analyzed recent RNA-Seq results obtained from pericarps with contrasting P1 alleles . We found that, albeit at low levels, two chalcone synthase genes (encoded by C2 and WHP) and two chalcone isomerase genes (Supplementary Figure 4) are expressed in P1-ww pericarps at 14 and 25 days after pollination (DAP). These results suggest that a P1-independent flavone accumulation pathway might be active in maize floral tissues.  In summary, our studies demonstrate that P1-rr maize kernels at 14 days after pollination (DAP) potentially provide a good source of flavones that could complement flavone-deficient diets in the absence of other flavone-rich vegetables.",5537c22d-cf42-4bbd-959c-23c0a96c7c8b
43,discussion7," The rich diversity offered by maize inbred lines and cultivars provide unique opportunities to select for maize genetic stocks that are simultaneously more resistant to emerging pathogens associated with global climate changes, and with increased levels of flavones with alleged beneficial effects and improved nutritional qualities.
