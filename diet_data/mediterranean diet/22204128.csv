0,background0,"The Fat Mass and Obesity (Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO)) and Melanocortin-4 Receptor (MC4R) genes are considered leading obesity-associated loci [1-6]. Both genes have been found to be highly expressed in the hypothalamus in rats [7] suggesting a role in a role in the central regulation of energy balance and appetite [7,8]. Although common variations in these genes have been consistently associated with a higher body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and obesity risk in numerous individual studies and meta-analyses [1-6,9-12], the association of these variants with a higher type 2 diabetes risk has only recently come to the fore, and is still highly controversial [9,13-24].",927c5ff1-556e-415b-af0f-9245c60f6666
1,background1," Regarding the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) gene, a recent meta-analysis [13] in East and South Asians, concluded that the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609 minor allele (or a proxy), the risk allele for obesity, increased the risk of type 2 diabetes, this association remaining statistically significant even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). Similar results were reported in a Scandinavian population [14]. In contrast, other studies, despite finding a higher type 2 diabetes risk in carriers of the risk-allele for obesity, concluded that this association disappears when adjusting for body mass index (BMI) [1,25-27]. There are also several investigations in which no association with type 2 diabetes was found [6,9,28-30].",5416f8cc-cfc1-4e4b-add7-721cfe3dc29b
2,background2," Along these lines, a recent editorial comment [24] stated that it is still unclear whether the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) is a diabetes-susceptibility gene and further data are needed at this stage, recommending that, in future studies, cases of type 2 diabetes and controls be paired by body mass index (BMI) to better analyze the independent effects on the two outcomes. Regarding the MC4R gene, there are fewer studies that have analyzed the association between the rs17782313 polymorphism (or a proxy) with type 2 diabetes than for the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) gene, and the results are even less conclusive [2,18,19,22,23,25,31].  Despite the numerous studies carried out in various populations, it is surprising that none of the above mentioned [1-31] have specifically examined the influence of the diet modulating the associations of the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) and the MC4R risk alleles with type 2 diabetes.",895a07ae-92ba-468c-881f-75bfae1fbe03
3,background3," The analysis of this modulation is of great importance as it has been reported that mice with increased fto expression did not develop glucose intolerance when fed a standard diet [32]. Interestingly, they developed glucose intolerance on a high fat diet [32]. Likewise, MC4R knockout mice exhibited increased adiposity and hyperinsulinemia and sometimes, depending on diet, developed type 2 diabetes [33]. Every day more importance is placed on the overall food intake pattern on type 2 diabetes [34-36] and the traditional MedDiet pattern, low in saturated fat and rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish, nuts and olive oil, reduces type 2 diabetes incidence [36-38]. Then, outstanding among the dietary factors that could modulate the effect of the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609 and the MC4R rs17782313 polymorphisms on type 2 diabetes, is the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet).",872d91bf-c5fd-4d70-bd1f-3a027c09219b
4,background4," Furthermore, the MedDiet is rich in folates [39] and folate availability is crucial for DNA methylation status [40]. Considering that dysregulation in DNA, methylation has been suggested as one relevant epigenetic mechanism in type 2 diabetes [41] and that both the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO)[42] and the MC4R[43] genes are regulated by methylation, the MedDiet might modulate the effect of these genes through epigenetic mechanisms.  As there are no published studies either for the MC4R or for the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) genes that have analyzed their interactions with MedDiet on type 2 diabetes, our main objective was to evaluate whether adherence to the MedDiet pattern modifies the association of the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609 and MC4R rs17782313 polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes, either independently or jointly. Our secondary aim was to examine the contribution of folate intake in this interaction. ",2bc59a76-8739-4694-969a-5238de63e9b2

These participants did not differ in the main characteristics from those of the total cohort (n=7,447). In 7,019 of them, the MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism was successfully determined. The PREDIMED study (http://www.predimed.org) is a multi-center clinical trial aimed at assessing the effects of the MedDiet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) [44,45].

The range of values of this aggregate score variable varied from 0 to 4 points. As the number of subjects with a score of 4 points was very low, a new score variable (score-grouped) was created grouping the categories of 3 and 4 points.

This result agrees with some previous studies in which no association with type 2 diabetes was reported [6,28-30].

However, in other reports [13-17,20,21] the association of the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) minor allele with type 2 diabetes risk persisted even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) increasing the evidence that the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) can also be considered a diabetes-prone gene.",1d8707bd-8826-46a9-a864-a8821abf8594

In the PREDIMED study, we fulfilled this requirement of having no differences in body mass index (BMI) between groups. This is a strength of our study and we were able to better analyze the effects of the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) on type 2 diabetes more specifically.  Accordingly, the main finding and novelty of our results is that we have found that the association between the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphism and type 2 diabetes depends on the diet consumed.",3204d257-a964-430a-9f29-439f5058d383
29,discussion3," Thus, when the dietary pattern departed from the traditional MedDiet (low-adherence to the MedDiet), the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609 was significantly associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk, while a good adherence to the MedDiet blunted this association. This gene-diet interaction was robust regardless of adjustment for body mass index (BMI). Our results are supported by studies in mice in which a modulation by diet on the association of the fto gene with glucose intolerance has been reported [32]. As far as we know this is the first time that a significant interaction between the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609 and diet in determining type 2 diabetes has been reported in humans. Another study [53] concomitantly examined the effects of physical activity and caloric intake on the association between the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs8050136 and diabetes in U.S. women, but found no statistically significant interaction.",683b0f75-bcc5-4c47-bc6e-0bf8374f50cb
30,discussion4," The small number of type 2 diabetes cases in that study [53] was a limitation.  There is increasing evidence that the MedDiet protects against type 2 diabetes [36,37], so it is not surprising that high adherence to this dietary pattern cancels the effects of greater genetic susceptibility to diabetes in Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) risk allele carriers. Such an interaction with diet might help explain the discrepancies in the published studies if those that did not find an association between the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphism and diabetes risk [6,28-30] were enriched in subjects following a diet similar to high adherence to the MedDiet pattern, while studies that detected this association [13-17,21] dealt with populations with a less healthy dietary pattern, compatible with low adherence to the MedDiet.  One limitation of our study is that we analyzed prevalent cases of type 2 diabetes, as the incidence of diabetes in our cohort is still being compiled.",dae0cc2c-820e-4fc9-8e7b-1c75132b520a
31,discussion5," Nevertheless, the dietary pattern of our study subjects was quite stable over time [44,54] and we did not detect differences in the adherence to the MedDiet depending on the duration of diabetes in this analysis. Similar results of no differences in diet were found in another study in Spain [35]. Thus, diabetes diagnosis did not change significantly the overall adherence to the MedDiet minimizing the reverse causation bias. Moreover, we have observed a similar protective effect of the MedDiet on type 2 diabetes risk when analyzing prevalent or incident type 2 diabetes cases in sub-samples of the PREDIMED study [37,54]. Likewise, in a Scandinavian population [14], the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609 was associated with both prevalent type 2 diabetes (OR 1.13; P<0.001) and the risk of developing incident type 2 diabetes (OR 1.16; P<0.001) having comparable results.",701d338c-b973-4606-8bdb-51081a2c9f7c
32,discussion6," Thus, although it is necessary to investigate the effect of the interaction between the level of adherence to the MedDiet and the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609 on incident type 2 diabetes cases in future studies, it is foreseeable that the results would be similar.  Just as for the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609, we found no associations of the MC4R rs17782313 with type 2 diabetes for the whole cohort despite a recent meta-analysis identifying the MC4R loci as a new loci related to type 2 diabetes in European populations [23]. Again, prior results from genetic association studies regarding this polymorphism and type 2 diabetes are discordant and sometimes vary after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) [2,18,19,22,25,26]. Although Qi et al [18] described a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in carriers of the minor allele, supporting preliminary data of Loos et al [2], Thomsen et al [25] in a large sample of Danish subjects did not find such association.",19205146-63cc-4e1f-842e-4161ff57f7f7
33,discussion7," Noticeably, we detected, for the MC4R rs17782313, a similar interaction with adherence to the MedDiet as for the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609, and this is also a relevant and novel finding of the present investigation. Moreover, when we analyzed the aggregate genetic score of the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) and MC4R polymorphisms, we also observed an additive effect of these polymorphisms on the gene-diet interaction, thus strengthening our results.  Besides examining the genetic interactions with adherence to the MedDiet, we analyzed interactions with various macronutrients and food groups, but found none (not shown). This strengthens the notion that for dietary modulation the contribution of one food is not crucial, but it is rather the overall dietary pattern with various foods or nutrients synergizing among them that is important.",f4afd203-7cf1-4ef9-aa63-c064dd00ff14
34,discussion8," Considering the significant gene-diet interaction results that we have obtained for the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) and MC4R loci, it would be interesting in future studies to analyze this interaction for other polymorphisms previously associated with obesity and/or diabetes [55-58].  Finally regarding our secondary objective aimed on studying the role of folate intake in this gene-diet interaction, given that recent literature is highlighting the importance of epigenetics in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [42,59,60], we found interesting preliminary results that require confirmation in future studies. Although no interaction of folate intake with the genetic variants on type 2 diabetes was observed, we examined fasting glucose concentrations as a more dynamic diabetes-related trait and found a statistically significant interaction between the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphism and folate intake in non-diabetic subjects.",04949315-1e67-4abb-b162-1bbb91ad3eec
35,discussion9," Thus, the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) variant allele tended to be associated with higher fasting glucose concentrations when folate intake was low, but not when it was high. Currently, the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) gene has been outlined as an important gene in which effects may be mediated through epigenetics [61]. A study reported that the CpG site in the first intron of the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) gene was hypomethylated in type 2 diabetes cases relative to controls [60]. Folate is required for the synthesis of S-adenosyl methionine, which serves as a methyl donor for DNA methylation events; thereby folate availability may be crucial in the DNA methylation status [40]. The MedDiet is rich in folate and so one of the mechanisms underlying its protective effect against type 2 diabetes could be the influence of folate on DNA-methylation and fasting glucose. Some clinical trials have shown folic acid supplementation reduces insulin resistance [62].",acb5b6dd-e87c-411f-873c-8cdc88309ed8
36,discussion10," Although it could be one of the mechanisms that may contribute to explaining the observed gene-diet interaction, we believe that it is not the only one and that more research has to be undertaken on this point. Although for MC4R we found no significant interaction with folate, there was a similar trend and, when analyzing the aggregate variable of both polymorphisms, the interaction term reached statistical significance, supporting additive effects. In this regard, there is a study in mice showing that diet might have an effect on the methylation status of the Mc4r gene [37]. However, our statistically significant results should be accepted with caution as folate intake may simply reflect a healthy dietary pattern and not a causal association with that micronutrient, given that, in our study, we did not carry out a methylation analysis to test this hypothesis.",9f5db9be-58e4-4295-b57c-f747fcc6988b
37,discussion11," Moreover, although we have found a nominally significant interaction between the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) polymorphism and the aggregate score and folate intake in determining fasting plasma glucose concentrations, we cannot rule out the possibility that, as this is a secondary hypothesis and we have not corrected the P-values for multiple comparisons, the association obtained represents a false positive result.  Conclusion In conclusion, we described for the first time a statistically significant gene-diet interaction of the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) rs9939609 and MC4R rs17782313 with adherence to the MedDiet on type 2 diabetes. When adherence was low, the obesity risk alleles were associated with type 2 diabetes regardless of body mass index (BMI), but more studies are needed to confirm this interaction.",bdf8d207-5ac6-480c-ad7f-a5ab100d7464
38,discussion12," Although we have also found a statistically significant interaction with folate intake on fasting glucose that may help to explain in part this interaction, the potential mechanisms behind this interaction remain to be investigated in further studies.
