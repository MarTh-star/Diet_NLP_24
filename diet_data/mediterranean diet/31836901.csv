Subjects The research was carried out following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments and it was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Granada (Ref. 201202400000697). The study included 85 children aged 7–18 years old, who attended the Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Child Nutrition Service from the “Virgen de las Nieves” University Hospital in Granada, Spain.  32 healthy children were included in the control group. Their serological screening was negative and they had no history of any chronic disease. These children attended this Service due to minor symptoms related to chronic functional constipation, according to the Rome IV criteria [25]. They were included in the control group once it was verified that it was due to transitory gastrointestinal symptoms (functional constipation).",0bd1f707-dd8d-4ff7-948e-c6b7b3b3cc25
1,methods1," The inclusion criteria for the control group were the following: (a) age between 7 and 18 years, (b) absence of serum IgA and IgG anti-transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies, (c) normal weight for the age, (d) absence of gastrointestinal disorders in the previous year and (e) normal appetite. Children with diagnosed CD according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN)) [2] were included in the CD group (n = 53). The exclusion criteria for both groups were acute and chronic inflammation, liver or kidney diseases, diabetes, chronic asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and consumption of dietary supplements that contain substances with antioxidant activity. Obese patients were also excluded (following the criteria of the International Task Force) [26] as well as those who did not sign the informed consent. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents.  2.2.",8f229b19-b3b4-4164-81d7-717d70be1858
2,methods2," Clinical and Socio-Demographics The same group of researchers assessed participants’ clinical and socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., age, household composition, parents’ marital status, educational level and smoking habit).  The International Physical Activity Questionnaire [27] was used to register physical activity.  2.3. Anthropometric Measures In both the control and the CD groups, Anthropometric characteristics (weight, height) were assessed. A stadiometer (Seca200, Hamburg, Germany) was used to measure height to the nearest 5 mm. The same mechanical balance was used to measure body weight (Seca200, Hamburg, Germany).  2.4. Blood Sampling Venous blood samples from fasting patients were collected into anticoagulated tubes with sodium heparin during morning hours. Blood samples were centrifuged at 2500× g at 4 °C for 10 min to obtain plasma. Plasma samples remained frozen (−80 °C) until measurements.  2.5.",0ac0831f-116e-49a4-a89e-839ecee9bf6b

4,methods4," 15-F2t-Isoprostanes The isoprostanes are prostaglandin-like compounds formed in vivo from the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of essential fatty acids. To measure the isoprostanes in urine, a commercial kit Enzyme Immunoassay for Urinary Isoprostane (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, UK) was used, which is a competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay (enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA)) for determining levels of 15-F2t-Isoprostane (the best characterized isoprostane) in urine samples. In order to eliminate interference due to non-specific binding, the urine samples were mixed with an enhanced dilution buffer. The 15-F2t-Isoprostane in the samples or standards competes with the 15-F2t-Isoprostane conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase (HRP)) for binding to a polyclonal antibody specific for 15-F2t-Isoprostane coated on the microplate.",13689991-f95d-4222-9f0a-2bae42c1e68f

The plate was read spectrophotometrically (Bio-tek, Vermont, Winooski, VT, USA) at 450 nm.  2.7. Total Antioxidant Status (Total Antioxidant Status (TAS)) Peripheral blood was placed in pre-cooled test tubes on the examination day in order to determine plasma Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) levels. The plasma was immediately separated in a refrigerated centrifuge, aliquoted and stored at −20 °C until further use.

Dietary Assessment A three-day food record, two on weekdays and one on the weekend was used to assess the dietary intake. The same trained nutritionist carefully explained face to face the diary to the children and their parents and accompanied with a photographic atlas including different portion-size food pictures and a set of household measures and detailed instructions for its compilation [28]. All foods consumed during the different meals (breakfast, morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner) were included in the survey.",427c412c-3452-43fa-846c-6012c1415a9b
8,methods8," For each meal, participants were requested to report an exhaustive description of the food and the recipes (including cooking methods and sugar or fats added during the meal preparation), food amount (according to the atlas) and the brands of packaged foods consumed.   Then foods were classified according to the NOVA classification, which has been employed in many studies conducted in several countries and is the most frequently used method to examine diets according to food processing, [17]. International bodies including PAHO, WHO and FAO also recognize and use it [18,29]. NOVA is a food classification based on the extent and purpose of industrial food processing, which classifies foods into four groups: unprocessed and minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods and ultra-processed foods [30]. The latter category encompasses a group of industrial formulations that are manufactured using several ingredients and a series of processes.",7574b0c6-b1ce-42ca-ac10-745094a4ae1d
9,methods9," In order to classify the foods as unprocessed or minimally processed, culinary ingredients, processed and ultra-processed foods based on the NOVA classification, the three-day food records were analyzed [30]. The total dietary energy intake was calculated for each individual. Subsequently, the energy (kcal/day) and percentage of calories (% of the total daily energy intake) derived from each category of the NOVA classification food item was calculated. The same trained nutritionist analyzed all diaries using the Evalfinut software that includes the Spanish Food Composition Database [31]. The specific composition of gluten and gluten-free ultra processed (UPF) (from labels) were introduced in the software when calculating dietary balance. The mean of the three-day food records was employed in the present analyses.  Moreover, the Mediterranean diet Quality Index in Children and Adolescents (KIDMED) survey was employed to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) [32].",23dc6eef-db82-477d-95e3-1e36b091194f
10,methods10," The KIDMED index ranges from 4 (no adherence to the MD) to 12 (complete adherence to the MD). This index was determined using a 16-point questionnaire, which assesses various dietary habits. Each answer was scored according to its consistency with habits associated with the Mediterranean dietary pattern. Then the scores were added up to quantify the total index of the participant’s adherence to the MD.   2.10. Data Analyses  Descriptive statistics (mean standard deviation) for quantitative variables and percentage of participants (%) for categorical variables were employed to describe the baseline characteristics of the study sample. To explore differences in the continuous variables, the Student-t test was conducted. Furthermore, differences in categorical variables were assessed by using the Chi-squared test.",e2e34b57-145f-4475-af52-de0de1828094
11,methods11,"   We employed a one-way analysis of covariance (a one way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)) after adjustment for age, sex and following a gluten free diet (GFD) for at least 18 months to assess differences in food groups consumption and NOVA food classification of children by CD (celiac group vs healthy group). The MD adherence by percentage of energy consumed from ultra processed (UPF) in celiac children (below 50% of daily energy intake vs. above 50% of daily energy intake) was compared by a one way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) after adjusting for age, sex and following a gluten free diet (GFD) for at least 18 months. Moderate physical activity (METS/week) by percentage of energy consumed from ultra processed (UPF) in celiac children (below 50% vs. above 50% of daily energy intake) was compared by a one way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) after adjusting for following a gluten free diet (GFD) for at least 18 months.",7a20c5f4-d654-4e09-b0fd-aad00b627ff6
12,methods12," An a one way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) after adjusting for moderate physical activity, following a gluten free diet (GFD) for at least 18 months and the MD adherence was also employed to assess differences in levels of oxidative/antioxidant biomarkers and inflammatory profiles between celiac children consuming ultra processed (UPF) below 50% of daily energy, above 50% of daily energy and control children. Post-hoc multiple comparisons (Bonferroni’s correction) were applied to examine pairwise differences between groups (e.g., celiac disease with daily energy intake from ultra processed (UPF) below 50% vs. controls). In those outcomes where outliers were/remained influential, we employed a subtle variation of winsorizing (convert back from a z-score: replacing extreme scores (z > 2.58) with a score equivalent to ±2.58 standard deviations from the mean) in order to handle these outliers.",0ec75583-1baf-4e30-8cd6-2bca435dfbbc

We conducted the data analyses with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22. IBM Corp.: Armonk, NY, USA), and the statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.  3. Results The baseline sociodemographic, dietary and anthropometric characteristics and physical activity levels of the study sample are shown in Table 1. A total of 53 children with CD participated in the study (mean age 9.6 ± 3.8 years). More than half of the participants with CD followed a gluten free diet (GFD) (68%) for less than 18 months and had a medium-high MD adherence (88%).

17,methods17," After adjusting for following a gluten free diet (GFD) for at least 18 months, CD children with more than 50% of daily energy intake from ultra processed (UPF) showed a lower intake of whole dairy products (p = 0.006) and a trend to higher intake of poultry (p = 0.076) and a lower intake of vegetables (p = 0.077).  4. Discussion Our results suggest that the consumption of ultra processed (UPF) was higher in the CD children compared to the control group. Among CD children, those with a lower intake of ultra processed (UPF) showed better inflammatory signaling and oxidative status (i.e., lower values for oxidative biomarkers and pro-inflammatory cytokines).  The only effective treatment for CD is a life-long strict gluten free diet (GFD) which, apart from maintaining the safe limit of gluten intake, must also be nutritionally balanced to ensure a healthy life.",9b08b97f-79a1-409c-8b40-9d2d696f9227
18,methods18," However, a gluten free diet (GFD) is a restrictive diet whose nutritional adequacy remains controversial with some evidence suggesting that gluten free diet (GFD) is nutritionally unbalanced [11,12,13]. The scientific literature raises questions concerning the food choices of individuals with CD because they substitute natural gluten-containing products with their ultra-processed gluten-free analogs [14]. This could have a negative effect on health, and it should be seriously taken into account, since the limited choice of food products in the diet of children with CD could induce a high consumption of ultra processed (UPF), such as snacks and biscuits. Our results showed that, in general, CD children had a greater percentage of daily energy intake from ultra processed (UPF) and drink products than the control children.",d9d3e74f-ad23-4dd3-b30f-c5adbeff563d
19,methods19," This could be partially explained because, within the range of gluten-free foods, CD children usually choose those that are made gluten free through a process of purification instead of those that are naturally gluten free, leading to a diet higher in fat and carbohydrates concentration [12,13]. However, after adjusting ultra processed (UPF) consumption for time of gluten free diet (GFD) (18 months), we observed that the differences disappeared, which may be due to a better adherence to the gluten free diet (GFD) and a better balance of macro and micronutrients among these patients, which highlights the need for close monitoring diet quality after the establishment of a gluten free diet (GFD) [33].  The consumption of ultra processed (UPF) has been directly related to increased mortality and the appearance of chronic non-communicable diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases, but also obesity, cancer or depression in the adult population [34].",9d6675ad-8842-4ce3-96a7-95f67201d0ad
20,methods20," There are several mechanisms which might explain this relationship including a lower consumption of vitamins A, B12, C, E, calcium, zinc, fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a higher intake of trans fats, sodium and sugars [20,21,35,36,37,38,39]. Furthermore, this eating pattern negatively affect the gut microbiota through the appearance of intestinal dysbiosis, which can trigger a pro-inflammatory immune response and an increase in intestinal permeability [14].  Despite the fact that there are numerous studies showing the defects of gluten free diet (GFD), only a few have assessed its effect on the clinical course and there are hardly any studies that assess its role in the physiopathology of the disease. It is known that gut microbiota disturbance [40] plays a key role in the pathogenesis of CD, as colonizing gut bacteria are critical for the normal development of host defense [41] for its metabolic and protective function of the host [42].",f3b723eb-4220-4684-b30c-515b1805d4b7
21,methods21," Various studies have revealed an alteration in the microbiota of celiac patients compared to the healthy controls, observing a reduction in the population of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and an increase especially in Bacteroides, Escherichia coli and Clostridium leptum [8,43]. Furthermore, a profile of bacterial proteases, capable of hydrolyzing gliadin, has been described in celiac patients that was absent in healthy ones, conforming a different bacterial proteolytic activity [44]. In this sense, the fact that the CD children in our study had a higher intake of ultra processed (UPF) may aggravate the pathophysiology of the disease.",c1dd263f-062e-4024-a6e0-9b1851269a44
22,methods22," On the other hand, the fact that CD children consume more ultra processed (UPF) could be because of, but not only, the characteristics of a poorly completed gluten free diet (GFD) and, although less likely, because of a less healthy consumption pattern in this group prior to the onset of the disease, due to the relationship of ultra processed (UPF) with the development of intestinal pathologies [14].  Contrarily, unprocessed and minimally processed food-based diets have shown the capacity to promote gut microbiota eubiosis, anti-inflammatory response, and epithelial integrity through bacterial butyrate production [45]. Indeed, a higher consumption of ultra processed (UPF) by CD children in our study leads to a less favorable redox and inflammatory profile (compared to CD children consuming less than 50% of daily energy intake from ultra processed (UPF) and controls), which altogether could also aggravate the pathophysiology of their disease.",aa58f2ea-091c-45a6-9efb-bb63839e3293
23,methods23," It is known that the oxidative status present in certain chronic diseases such as CD, especially at diagnosis, is caused by the interaction of gluten in the lamina propria, acting at the local and genomic level with an intracellular oxidative imbalance, characterized by increased levels of lipid peroxidation products [46,47] which can induce the formation of oxidative DNA lesion products (8-OHdG) [48]. Additionally, CD patients present a severe reduction of antioxidant capacity (including antioxidant vitamins) [49]. It is known that reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling can enhance the synthesis of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1 [50]. In fact, we previously [4] reported the increase in these inflammatory molecules in children with CD who followed a gluten free diet (GFD).",606e7cb1-7bb6-48c8-96ac-7805080c8451
24,methods24," Interestingly, these changes are maintained after adjusting for gluten free diet (GFD) time, which could be due to a strong enough response to induce an inflammatory state which is maintained and probably a parallel pathway in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and the oxidative status of uncontrolled disease. In this sense, we can assume that there is another source of the deleterious pro-inflammatory cytokines. Present results suggest that a higher ultra processed (UPF) consumption and lower physical activity levels could be responsible. A healthy lifestyle includes meeting the recommendations regarding minimum levels of physical activity. It is well established that adequate physical activity levels promote better inflammatory and redox profiles in the general adult population [51,52].",9e642015-fd2a-47e7-a0f2-af6a87f3358d
25,methods25," Notwithstanding, there are specific ways in which the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory, oxidant-antioxidant factors associated with exercise can influence health and growth in children [22]. Therefore, the influence of physical activity and exercise on inflammatory signal and redox status in children remains unclear. In fact, Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) concentrations were lower among our CD children with ultra processed (UPF) below 50% of daily energy intake, which may suggest a lower need of release of this relevant antioxidant enzyme in this group of patients. It should be taken in account that Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) levels usually increase with exercise among adult populations [52]. However, oxidative stress responses to exercise and the underlying mechanisms in the pediatric population are still unclear [53]. Therefore, not only diet matters, and it might be mandatory that CD children exercise for a better prognosis of the disease [23].",76a4dd7f-7add-4b6e-810b-be593f7ccb23
26,methods26," Studies exploring the influence of objectively measured physical activity levels and different exercise programs on CD patients are warranted in order to better design effective lifestyle interventions.  In our study, the adherence to the MD was inversely related to the intake of ultra processed (UPF), in a similar way to that described previously [54]. Notwithstanding, small differences were found regarding dietary habits between CD children according to ultra processed (UPF) intake. In fact, CD children with more than 50% of daily energy intake from ultra-processed foods showed a lower intake of whole dairy products and a trend to higher intake of poultry and lower of vegetables. As a result, although a tendency towards healthier habits has been observed in CD children with less than 50% of daily energy intake from ultra processed (UPF), the differences might not be strong enough to reflect changes in the overall dietary pattern.",b4ea473f-c771-4d7e-a96d-d1e5525211b4
27,methods27," Consequently, the global index of adherence to the MD may not be sensitive enough. Indeed, even after adjusting our results for MD adherence, patients who consumed less than 50% of their daily energy intake from ultra processed (UPF) presented a more favorable oxidative-antioxidant and inflammatory profiles than those with greater ultra processed (UPF) consumption. The MD is characterized by being a diet with high antioxidant power and with nutrigenomic modulation capacity, showing itself as a protective factor against various diseases [55], but in recent years there has been a greater consumption of processed and ultra-processed foods of animal origin in the pediatric population [56]. In this sense, other studies have correlated the consumption of ultra processed (UPF) and the development of diseases adjusting for adherence to the MD and they failed to confirm the present results [57].   5. Strengths and Limitations There are some limitations that must be underlined.",2f9b9c8a-a589-4049-939b-19c511f6361d
28,methods28," Firstly, the present study sample size was relatively small and it should be noted that since it is a cross-sectional study we cannot establish causal relationships, and consequently the present results must be interpreted with caution. Secondly, the assessment of physical activity levels was self-reported (through the IPAQ) instead of objectively measured through accelerometry, which constitute the gold standard. Based on the present findings, it is advisable to recruit a higher number of participants to confirm or contrast the present findings.  6. Conclusions Overall, our results indicate that CD children who consumed more ultra processed (UPF) and performed less physical activity presented higher levels of oxidative stress and some pro-inflammatory cytokines, regardless of the time on a gluten free diet (GFD).",cb459263-5410-4046-8806-f5ca0cfc9755
29,methods29," This suggests that for a better redox and inflammatory profile it is necessary to promote healthy lifestyle habits which include improvements in the quality of the diet, regardless of CD. An unhealthy dietary pattern it is shown as a parallel pathway that could have important consequences in terms of cellular aging and long-term prognosis in CD children. Among the healthy living patterns, the adherence to a MD might be a key factor, which was inversely associated with the consumption of ultra processed (UPF). ",30747aa5-f7a7-40eb-9a2f-07f43296950d
