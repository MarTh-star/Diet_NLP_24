Both men and women between the ages of 25–55 years, being overweight to obese (BMI: 25–40 kg/m2) but otherwise healthy, were included in the study. Subjects were excluded if they: had a metabolic or chronic disease; had an allergy to carrot, grape, grapefruit, green tea, caffeine, or to guarana; were involved at the time of recruitment or within the previous 6 months in a chronic supplementation program, engaged in smoking cessation, or had high alcohol consumption; were pregnant or were breastfeeding; were in menopause; were suffering depression; or were involved in physical activity more than twice a week.",9c330f6b-edc6-4057-b639-64e0f7388f1d
1,methods1,"  The study was approved by the Universidad Católica San Antonio de Murcia (Universidad Católica San Antonio de Murcia (UCAM)), Spain) Ethics Committee (approval N° 5551) and conducted per the guidelines laid out in the Declaration of Helsinki [26] and in compliance with Good Clinical Practices defined in the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline [27]. All participants were informed about the study procedures and signed written informed consent before entering the study. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03423719.  2.2. Test Supplement  Fiit-ns®, developed by FYTEXIA (France), is principally obtained by alcohol and water extraction of grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macfad), grape (Vitis vinifera L.), and guarana seed (Paullinia cupana Kunth); by water extraction of green tea (Camellia sinensis L. Kuntze) and black carrot (Daucus carota L.).",ef04fe09-4b8a-4485-ac98-a945ad41218a
2,methods2," Fiit-ns® provides bioactive compounds, specifically polyphenols from the flavonoid family, and natural components of the methylxanthine family to from an extract of guarana seeds, as well as vitamin B3. The placebo product was 100% maltodextrin, which is polyphenol-, methylxanthine- and vitamin B3-free. Both Fiit-ns® and placebo were supplied in 450 mg capsules of identical appearance and flavor.  The supplement was analyzed by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)). An Agilent high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 1260 apparatus (Agilent Technologies, Les Ulis, France) using software Openlab CDS Chemstation Edition (version 1.3.1) coupled with a diode array detector was used. Separations were carried out by means of a Zorbax Stablebond SB-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm; 5 µm particle size).",5ee975bc-20e2-490a-88d8-ee77bfad281a
3,methods3," To detect different phenolic classes, two different analytical methods were adopted: one for bioflavonoids and caffeine and one for anthocyanins.  For flavonoids and caffeine, mobile phase A consisted of water, mobile phase B was acetic acid, and mobile phase C was 100% acetonitrile. The linear gradient program was used as follows: (a) 0 to 5 min 94% A and 6% B; (b) 5 to 10 min 82.4%A, 5.6% B, and 12% C; (c) 10 to 15 min 76.6% A, 5.4% B, and 18% C; (d) 15 to 25 min 67.9% A, 5.1% B, and 27% C; (e) 25 to 30 min 65% A, 5% B, and 30% C; (f) 30 to 35 100% C; (g) 35 to 40 min 100% C; (h) 40 to 45 min 64% A and 6% B. Monitoring was performed at 280 nm at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and injection volume of 25 µL. Flavanones, flavanols, and caffeine were respectively expressed as naringin, catechin, and caffeine.  Regarding anthocyanins, mobile phase A was water, mobile phase B consisted of formic acid, and mobile phase C was acetonitrile.",0d458afd-1c89-4b0d-a6a9-4f46d73fc88a
4,methods5," Eligible participants were randomized using a simple block randomization of 1:1 with an additional stratification for sex (40% minimum and 60% maximum each sex), with a separated randomization list using computer-generated random numbers. Allocation concealment was achieved with sealed opaque envelops. Once enrolled, subjects received either the supplement (n = 43) or a visually identical placebo (n = 49). They were instructed to take two capsules daily for 16 weeks, one in the morning at breakfast and one at lunchtime.  Throughout the course of the study, volunteers were instructed by a dietitian to consume a normal caloric and balanced diet corresponding to their individual needs by determining their specific resting energy expenditure (resting energy expenditure (REE)), calculated from the revised Harris–Benedict equation and adjusted per individual level of physical activity [28].",9da87554-93ad-45d2-9e8b-a46225b72acf
5,methods6," At baseline (W1), volunteers performed a 24 h diet recall interview corresponding to the consumption of two days during the previous week and one day during the previous weekend, in order to evaluate their usual dietary habits. At the end of the studied period, the same interview was performed to check compliance with dietary instructions. A difference of ±10% between the reported and recommended intakes at the end of the study was considered as satisfactory. Moreover, general adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS)) [29]. This score ranges from 0 to 24, with an optimal cut-off point of 13.5, which discriminates adherent and non-adherent individuals.  Subjects were also encouraged to maintain their usual level of physical activity throughout the 16-week-long intervention period.",2a2d07fb-c875-40c2-8047-f2b21f9db3fa
6,methods7," The subjects were provided with a pedometer (HJ-321, Omron Healthcare), which was worn at the hip, to record the physical mobility as the number of daily steps. Subjects reported their daily level of activity in a diary.  Subjects reported to the Universidad Católica San Antonio de Murcia (UCAM) Research Center for 5 visits: (i) pre-inclusion visit at week 0 (W0) to verify the subject’s eligibility, to assess anthropometrics, and to collect blood samples for the evaluation of safety parameters; (ii) baseline visit (W1); (iii) follow-up visits (W4, W8, and W12); and final visit (W16). During each visit, subjects returned their physical activity diary and the unused investigational supplements and were questioned about possible occurrence of adverse events before they were provided with a new pill dispenser for the 4 following weeks.  2.4.

7,methods8," Health-Related Quality of Life  health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) was measured at baseline (W1) and at the end of the intervention period (W16) using the Spanish version of the 36-item Short Form (SF-36) health survey [30]. This generic instrument assesses participants’ self-reported health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) across physical and mental components. Questions pertained to the individuals’ typical day during the past four weeks and usual experiences. The 36 questions were distributed across eight subscales: physical function (PF), role-physical (RP) limitations caused by physical problems, bodily pain (BP), general health (GH) perception, vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE) limitations caused by emotional problems, and emotional well-being (emotional well being (EWB)).",9a9d7c93-3ab7-460c-8b79-0ed8218655a3
8,methods9," The eight dimensions ranged in score from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)). The SF-36 also included one Physical Component Summary (Physical Component Summary (PCS)) score and one Mental Component Summary (Mental Component Summary (MCS)) score, as well as an overall score of quality of life.  2.4.2. Body Composition  At baseline (W1) and at the end of the study period (W16), body composition was assessed in the morning, with volunteers in a fasted state and wearing light clothing and no shoes.  Body weight (kg) was measured with calibrated weighing scales (TBF-300MA, Tanita Corporation, IL, USA). Waist circumference (cm) was measured at the narrowest point between the lowest rib and the iliac crest using a non-stretchable tape. The Index of Central Obesity (Index of Central Obesity (ICO)) scores were calculated as the waist-to-height ratio.",feaef9e9-abcd-4c85-aae5-c01b8a068fea
9,methods10,"  Body fat mass was determined using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) scan of the whole body (XR-46; Norland Corp., Fort Atkinson, WI, USA). Discrimination of whole-body fat mass (FM) and body trunk fat mass (trunk fat mass (TFM)) was performed with a computerized software (Software Illuminatus dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) v.4.4.0, Visual MED, Inc., Charlotte, NC, USA and Norland CooperSurgical Company, Minneapolis, MN, USA) using standardized procedures.  2.4.3. Self-Reported Physical Activity  The self-reported International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) instrument was used to determine global physical activity levels [31]. This self-administered, long-form questionnaire consisted of 27 items that covered four different domains of physical activity (working, transportation, housework, and gardening and leisure-time) that occurred during the previous seven days.",0a1bfdbb-526d-4438-b4f9-c04cefcbec66
10,methods11," The results are presented as an estimation of energy expenditure in metabolic equivalent minutes per week (Met-min/week), and a categorical score was calculated to classify volunteers as inactive, moderately, or highly active. Volunteers completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) questionnaire in the presence of an investigator at W1 and W16.  2.4.4. Safety Parameters  Safety parameters were assessed before inclusion into the study (W0) and at the end of the intervention period (W16) in order to verify and confirm the healthiness of the volunteers. Safety parameters included liver function parameters (alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (aminotransferase (AST)), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)), renal function parameters (urea, creatinine, sodium (Na), potassium (K)), and heart rate.  2.5. Statistical Analysis  Data sets were analyzed using XLSTAT-Biomed software (v. 2017.6 for Mac, Addinsoft, Paris, France).",aac6252e-d66e-44f0-b6f9-2a7cf920ffe9
11,methods12," The data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). At baseline, the distribution was considered normal. Changes within and between groups at W1 and W16 were analyzed using paired and unpaired Student’s t-test, respectively. To compare baseline differences between the SF-36 scales and population norms, one sample t-test was used. A minimum value of p ≤ 0.05 was selected as the threshold for statistical significance.  The primary outcome addressed in this study was the difference in SF-36 total scores after the 16 week intervention period. The power calculation was based on the previous results of a pilot study conducted with Fiit-ns® [32] (α = 0.05, power (1−β) = 0.8) and was performed based on an expected clinical difference in SF-36 total scores between W1 and W16 within the supplemented group of a +5% benefit minimum to determine the targeted final sample size (n = 28 per group).",ad6c45fe-18c5-4480-ba27-02ba276703ce

Characterization of the Supplement  The total bioactive content corresponds to 29.27 g/100 g dry matter, with a total flavonoid content measured at 24.75 g/100 g. The flavanol content corresponded to 15.67 g/100 g and included catechin, epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin, and epicatechin gallate, respectively, measured at 1.47, 9.55, 2.37, and 2.28 g/100 g. The flavanone content corresponded to 8.91 g /100 g, among which isonaringin, naringin, hesperidin, and neohesperidin contents were 0.54, 7.65, 0.03, and 0.13 g/100 g, respectively, whereas total unidentified flavanone was evaluated as the naringin equivalent at 0.56 g/100 g. The total anthocyanin content corresponded to 0.17 g/100 g as the kuromanin equivalent. The caffeine content was measured at 4.52 g/100 g and a third-party laboratory measured the vitamin B3 content at 2.02 g/100 g (Table 1).  3.2.",c99dfab4-2c29-48f2-bf9f-2b2c70d23930
13,methods14," Baseline Characteristics  From the 92 individuals who were randomly allocated to either the supplement (n = 43) or the placebo (n = 49), 78 subjects completed the 16 week intervention (85% of the randomly assigned subjects); after having started the intervention, a total of 14 volunteers dropped out for personal reasons, including 6 within the supplemented group and 8 within the placebo group. Moreover, at the end of the study period, 6 subjects were excluded from final analysis because of protocol deviation, including 2 subjects within the supplemented group and 4 within the placebo group who either did not complete the SF-36 questionnaire or who were non-compliant with the protocol. Finally, 72 volunteers were included in the analysis, with 35 individuals in the supplemented and37 individuals in the placebo group (Figure 1). Baseline data of the study population are presented in Table 2. The two groups were similar with respect to age, height, body weight, and SF-36 total scores.",c32bc119-7c5a-4b3a-b9bd-01337a58e3c9
14,methods15," At baseline, the placebo group had a significantly higher average BMI compared with the supplemented group.  3.3. Health-Related Quality of Life  Regarding the whole population at baseline (Table 3), SF-36 subscales regarding vitality, emotional well-being, and mental component scores were significantly lower than the age-specific populations norms taken from the Spanish population reference values [33]. At W1, placebo and supplemented groups exhibited similar SF-36 scores, including both individual domains and summary scores (Table 4). After 16 weeks of supplementation, the supplemented group experienced a significant +5.3% increase (p = 0.001) (Figure 2) in total SF-36 score, while no change was observed in the total score of the placebo group. The supplemented group showed statistically significant improvements in five out of eight domains of the health-related quality of life.",8a42660e-8ec9-4caa-85d8-00ded606f9c6
15,methods16," Respective improvements were observed for the physical component summary (Physical Component Summary (PCS); +11.2%, p = 0.002), including physical functioning (PF; +5.5%, p = 0.006), bodily pain (BP; +11.2%, p = 0.028), and general health (GH; +7.2%, p = 0.010), as well as for the mental component summary (Mental Component Summary (MCS); +4.1%, p = 0.021), which included vitality (VT; +7.8%, p = 0.006) and emotional well-being (emotional well being (EWB); +5.2%, p = 0.021). No statistically significant changes were shown within the placebo group after the 16 week intervention.  3.4. Body Composition  At baseline, all fat-mass-related variables (FM, trunk fat mass (TFM), Index of Central Obesity (Index of Central Obesity (ICO)), and BMI) were significantly higher in the placebo group (Table 5). Such a discrepancy is explained by the higher number of obese individuals that completed the clinical investigation in the placebo group.",1100aac5-974b-4e8d-a18a-cdfeeb77a418
16,methods17," After 16 weeks of supplementation, volunteers from the placebo group did not experience any significant changes in body composition. The supplemented group showed an improvement in anthropometrics after 16 weeks, with a statistically significant decrease in body weight by −1.3 kg (p = 0.013) and in BMI by −0.4 points (p = 0.012). Waist size significantly decreased by −1.1 cm (p = 0.017), consequently lowering the Index of Central Obesity (ICO) by −1.3% (p = 0.018). Supplemented volunteers significantly lost −1.2 kg of FM (p = 0.033), of which −1.0 kg was fat lost only from the trunk fat mass (TFM) (p = 0.002).  3.5. Self-Reported Physical Activity and Average Daily Steps Recording  At baseline, both groups showed similar self-reported levels of physical activity. While it did not significantly change within the placebo population (p = 0.280), the supplemented subjects showed an increase of +1308 Met-min/week (p = 0.05) after 16 weeks of supplementation (Table 6).",b8f6c0ca-e0ea-419c-a229-fcba1add2ecb
17,methods18," Regarding categorical scores at baseline, the rates of volunteers within each category (i.e., inactive, moderately active, and highly active) were similar between groups. After 16 weeks, the rates of inactive people remained the same in both groups; within the placebo group, the rate of highly active subjects decreased by −43%, while the rate of moderately active individuals increased by +14%. In contrast, within the supplemented population, the rate of moderately active subjects decreased by −14% but the number of highly active individuals increased by +43%. The number of average daily steps was significantly different at baseline between placebo and supplemented subjects (p = 0.028). The placebo group did not experience any significant change in average daily steps monitored after 16 weeks, while the supplemented subjects significantly decreased their average rate by −678 steps (p = 0.019) to reach a similar level to the placebo population.  3.6.",b7d440d7-b4fe-4566-b7e8-09d63ebf0267
18,methods19," Recommended and Reported Dietary Intake  Recommended intake at baseline did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.770) (Table 7). When recommended intake was compared with reported intake at baseline, the differences were −13.7% and −7.8% for the placebo and supplemented groups, respectively. After 16 weeks, the differences between recommended and reported intake in both groups were lower than 10% (−8.8% and −9.0% for the placebo and for the supplemented groups, respectively). Mediterranean Diet Serving Scores (Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS)) were similar between both groups at 8.4 and 8.6 for placebo and supplemented populations, respectively, indicating a non-adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern during the intervention period.  3.7. Safety  After 16 weeks, both liver and renal function parameters were within the healthy range in both groups, suggesting that no health impairment occurred throughout the course of the study.",949efadc-df55-4527-b41f-0e8ad8ab120d
19,methods20," Moreover, heart rates stayed stable throughout the course of the study (Table 8). No adverse events or side effects linked to the supplement were reported during the course of the study.  4. Discussion  The main results of this study demonstrate that a 16-week-long supplementation period with an ingredient formulated from a blend of various botanical extracts, which are rich in a diversity of polyphenols and usually consumed as part of the typical Mediterranean diet, is associated with significant improvements of both the physical and mental components of the health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) in overweight and obese but otherwise healthy subjects of both sex.  At baseline, volunteers showed an impaired health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)), namely in vitality and emotional well-being subscales, for which values were below the Spanish age-specific population reference norms [33].",41554d2a-6395-4bae-8ec7-b318031934cc
20,methods21," Although similar studies have previously reported impairment across all off the SF-36 subscales, most of them were conducted either with a population displaying a significantly higher grade of obesity or with an additional manifestation of comorbidities [10,17]. Here, baseline impairments observed for vitality and emotional well-being are in line with the work of Blissmer et al. [11], who found similar decrements in a highly comparable population of healthy overweight and moderately obese subjects, indicating higher feelings of tiredness and anxiety.  Following a 16 week intervention period associated with a normal caloric diet, both the physical and mental components of the health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) significantly improved in volunteers supplemented with the polyphenol-rich ingredient compared to the placebo group.",fd36f95c-d8d1-4387-9d83-0df6b816f9ed
21,methods22," Net improvements were shown by subjective ameliorations in bodily pain > general health > vitality > physical functioning > emotional well-being. It is noteworthy that after the 16-week-long period of supplementation, both the vitality and the emotional well-being values improved to achieve the level of the reference norms of the Spanish age-specific population. Improvements in these different subscales and in both the physical and mental component scores must be considered as clinically significant, as it has been stated that absolute differences of 3–5 points are clinically relevant [34].  In addition to these improvements, the 16 week chronic polyphenolic supplementation induced significant body weight loss, with an average difference between both groups of 1.1 kg. It is noteworthy that this decrease was essentially driven by an 86% fat mass reduction, for which 89% was located within the trunk area, pointing out a particularly beneficial effect on body composition.",22282342-914d-4a30-91b9-3c8cbf4d0ba5
22,methods23," Such an improvement may, to some extent, positively impact the health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)). Indeed, some authors have demonstrated that weight loss was associated with improvement of both physical and mental health dimensions in several intervention trials [11,13,35,36,37]. Moreover, the amount of weight loss and the level of health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) improvement may be directly interconnected [37,38]. Nevertheless, here we did not demonstrate a significant correlation between weight or fat loss and health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) improvement, hypothesizing that weight loss could be an indirect consequence of health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) improvement, as it has been recently demonstrated with a bi-directional relationship between both parameters [39].",2848a73d-4028-4e41-959a-acf46c5ebaa1
23,methods24," Moreover, catechins from green tea have previously been demonstrated to have antiobesity effects [40] through various mechanisms of action, such as the inhibition of pancreatic lipase [41], as well as through the regulation of obesity-related genes and proteins [42]. However, it is important to highlight that these interventional studies used significantly higher amounts of green tea catechins, whereas in the current supplement it only corresponded to one cup of green tea daily. Moreover, caffeine content and flavanones from grapefruit extract could also potentiate the decrease in body fat mass, as enhanced lipolysis leading to decreases in body weight and fat mass has previously been demonstrated in overweight and obese subjects supplemented with such kinds of bioactive compounds [43].",d8fb6db6-5e9f-459d-ad77-fbce24359af2
24,methods25," Accordingly, as each of the bioactive components in the supplement are present at lower levels compared to efficient dosages from the literature, it could be assumed that the beneficial observations for the supplement should be attributed to the whole formulation.  In parallel to body composition improvement, the level of physical activity, as assessed through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) questionnaire, significantly intensified (p = 0.05) after 16 weeks of supplementation. Thus, while 69% of volunteers from the supplemented group maintained their usual level of physical activity, 25% moved into a higher category compared with the placebo population, for which only 9% of volunteers improved their level of physical activity. Contradictorily, at the same time, the supplemented group showed a decrease in daily steps as assessed with a pedometer, while no change was observed in the placebo population.",92bb8e62-527e-422d-9dde-4541b5af98ab
25,methods26," This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that pedometers are not suitable for the measurement of certain types of physical activity, such as swimming, cycling, or heavy lifting, which are otherwise assessed through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) questionnaire, making these both subjective and objective measurements, two complementary tools in physical activity assessment. As volunteers were encouraged to maintain their usual physical activity level throughout the course of the study, it can be hypothesized that the significantly higher physically active lifestyle reported within the supplemented group is not the result of conditioned mental engagement only. Indeed, the increase of health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)), and namely of the feeling of increased vitality, may explain such a rise in physical activity.",feb3529d-4281-4982-9697-e0d43df46838
26,methods27," A recent review that aimed at examining the link between physical activity and health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) concluded that there is a consistent cross-sectional association between physical activity level and health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)), namely in the vitality and in the physical functioning domains, however the finding could not confirm a causal relationship, i.e., “higher health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) leading to a higher level of physical activity, or vice versa, or mutual influence” [44]. Nevertheless, the engagement in a more active lifestyle within the supplemented population may also have a positive effect on body composition improvement, as discussed above.",a34e4069-ac39-46b2-b740-3b8d4f64a27a
27,methods28,"  Besides positive effects on body composition and engagement in physical activity, it appears that phenolic compounds may induce, through other various mechanisms, observable effects in terms of health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) improvement. Accordingly, adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, characterized by wide consumption of fruits and vegetables, cereals, fish, olive oil, and red wine, has been directly associated with better quality of life (QOL) in an analysis including more than 11,000 participants that belonged to the SUN (Seguimiento University of Navarra) cohort [45,46]. While several nutrients and micronutrients may contribute to this effect, phenolic compounds have been suggested to be the main mediators; a large cross-sectional study demonstrated a direct relationship between the antioxidant contents of the Mediterranean diet, including the flavonoid content, and health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) [25].",58f407b8-b6d0-4aad-b39b-f528636f606e
28,methods29," In addition, in another recent study including more than 13,000 women, higher flavonoid intake at midlife was associated with increased odds of healthy ageing, based on higher survival at older ages free of chronic diseases and maintenance of midlife health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) (as assessed by the SF-36 survey) [47]. Here, despite the studied population being Spanish and particularly prone to complying with the Mediterranean diet, the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) did not demonstrate any significant adherence to this pattern in either groups, for whom the consumption of fruits and vegetables, the main sources of flavonoids, was below the recommendations of the last updated version of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid [48].",21db9203-c4d0-4386-9a59-4c734ee053d8
29,methods30," Thus, it can be hypothesized that a regular basic diet has no or only a minor impact on health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)), since there were no improvements within the placebo population, whereas the supplemented subjects that covered the gap of phenolic micronutrients significantly improved their health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)).  Bioactive compounds occurring in the supplement may positively impact physiological functions related to both physical and mental health status—mainly vascular inflammation, coagulation factors, and endothelial function [25], which are all described to be impaired during overweight and obesity [49]. The aptitude of certain phenolic compounds in improving vascular health has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo [50].",492e2a03-fb1d-43a7-8428-b95d09144942
30,methods31," Catechins from green tea positively impact vascular function through various complementary mechanisms linked to their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as to their capacity to activate endothelial NO synthase [51]. Similarly, grape polyphenols also demonstrated an aptitude to improving vascular impairments through similar molecular mechanisms [52], all contributing to a better peripheral and central blood flow, which in turn may positively affect physical and mental health status [53].  While modulation of both oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters, the main contributors in the improvement of vascular function and blood flow, has previously been demonstrated with the current supplement in a study involving obese subjects [32], specific mechanisms of flow-mediated dilation improvements and subsequent blood flow increase have not yet been investigated.",e649c65f-9073-48ca-b3b5-a59cebfa42d4
31,methods32," Moreover, as the beneficial effect of the supplement on health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) has been demonstrated, further investigations will have to be conducted in attempts to confirm the causal relationship between the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of the polyphenols metabolites and the mechanisms involved in improving vascular function.  Beyond the mentioned limitations, the results of the present study reveal the beneficial and systemic effects of phenolic compounds on subjective physical and mental symptoms linked to overweight and obesity. The study was designed to minimize bias, and thus individualized calorie intake recommendations and diet interviews, as well as monitoring of daily steps, were identified as possible confounding factors.",98957d46-aa7f-4870-ba34-b7f75c2086fe
32,methods33," Despite the studied population being recruited in a Mediterranean region, neither of the two groups adhered to the typical regional diet, which strengthens the hypothesis that phenolic compounds certainly contribute to subjective health, as previously proposed by others [25,47].  In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the 16-week-long consumption of an ingredient obtained from polyphenol-rich fruit and vegetable extracts associated with both caffein and vitamin B3 supports improvements in health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)), specifically in both mental and physical subjective feelings. In addition, the decrease in body fat mass and the significantly increased engagement in physical activity probably established a virtuous cycle between body composition, physical activity, and perceived health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)).",c1a9e783-2708-4ef1-b6ec-1885b0663adb
33,methods34," The mechanisms of action likely involve improvements in vascular function via well-known antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of phenolic compounds. Such beneficial effects may be extended to other situations where health related quality of life (HRquality of life (QOL)) is impaired, particularly during the ageing process, where an imbalance of body composition and a loss of vitality and of physical functioning associated with a more sedentary lifestyle are commonly observed.
