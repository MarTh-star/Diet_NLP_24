Mediterranean diet (MD) has been demonstrated to be beneficial for adequate nutrient intake. This article aims to evaluate the MD adherence and dietary calcium intake in a group of pregnant Italian women and to investigate how these are linked to each other and to fast glycemia at first trimester of pregnancy. Two hundred and seventy‐nine pregnant women were recruited at the gynecology units of two hospitals in Florence. Socio‐demographic, clinical information, and results of the first trimester blood sample analysis were collected. Two questionnaires, validated for evaluation of MD adherence and calcium intake, were administered to the pregnant women. Approximately 60% of the women had a high level of MD adherence, with a mean dietary calcium intake of 870.3 ± 335.3.",2effc47b-d17d-41b3-bdce-18bd9fdc6654

It can be considered a “global problem of public health,” because the disease itself and the resulting fractures are an important cause of morbidity and mortality for millions of people worldwide (Peters & Martini, 2010).  Although OP incidence is particularly high in older women, young women may also be affected.",e113fc32-3273-4cf4-abbd-b5d06bc70d37
4,abstract4," Pregnancy itself is not a risk factor, but it could become one, if pregnant women do not intake adequate dietary nutrients and/or previous conditions have compromised the optimal achievement of peak bone mass (Società Italiana dell’Osteoporosi & del Metabolismo Minerale e delle Malattie dello Scheletro, 2016). During pregnancy and breastfeeding, calcium metabolism is subject to variations because of fetus skeleton formation. Bone resorption and calcium mobilization from bone tissue increase during the last trimester of pregnancy (Møller et al., 2012). A great deal of calcium loss also occurs through breastfeeding: in fact, calcium reserves are used for breast milk production, and the mother's skeleton could be impoverished (Møller et al., 2012), (Osteofoods, http://www.osteofoods.it/alimentazione/gravidanza‐e‐allattamento). If a woman begins and continues pregnancy and breastfeeding with a deficiency of calcium and vitamin D, she could be exposed to a high risk of OP (Ferrari et al.",d15b5eee-bbc8-4db1-aa61-432de6acd6f0
5,abstract5,", 2012; Hyde et al., 2017; Hyde et al., 2017; Park et al., 2017).  In order to support maternal and fetal requirements, pregnant women need a healthy diet (World Health Organization [World Health Organization (WHO)], 2016). World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) confirms that correct nutrients intake during pregnancy is achieved through the consumption of a wide variety of foods, such as vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and dairy products (World Health Organization, 2015).",1bdc8bca-05aa-40e6-ba54-033de2bae122

The traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern is characterized by a high consumption of vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, and whole grains, the use of olive oil as dressing, a moderate consumption of fish, milk and dairy products, and a low consumption of meat and poultry (Rivas et al., 2013).  The Mediterranean diet (MD) was demonstrated to be associated with a reduced risk of major chronic disease (Dinu et al., 2018).",6b199f64-7161-4f62-8a47-63f8f145901e

Moreover, the consumption of Mediterranean food groups (and nutrients inside them) resulted to be fundamental for bone health (Choi & Park, 2016; De França et al., 2013; Fernández‐Real et al., 2012; García‐Martínez et al., 2014; Hayhoe et al., 2015; Mangano et al., 2015).",cb5d280c-20b6-4fce-abbf-138e219a689f

Many studies highlighted that diet could be a determining factor for the development of OP in women and for the correct bone formation in the fetus (Hyde, Brennan‐Olsen, Bennett, et al., 2017; Hyde, Brennan‐Olsen, Wark, et al., 2017).",06138314-b194-41f2-a4a1-90638c44d985
10,abstract10," In fact, a diet rich in fresh vegetables and fruit, whole bread, rice, pasta, yogurt, and breakfast cereals, and with a low intake of fried potatoes, refined sugars, white bread, processed meat, canned vegetables, and soft drinks is associated with greater bone mass in pregnant women and better bone mineralization in the fetus (Petersen et al., 2015). A cohort study by Cole et al. examined the influence of different diet styles in a population of pregnant women on bone mineralization and forearm fracture incidence in the newborn (Cole et al., 2009). Results showed that there was not a direct correlation between the mother's nutrition style and fracture incidence in the newborn, but a mother's diet poor in fruit and vegetables and rich in fats, processed meat and potatoes is associated to a higher incidence of forearm fractures during infancy (Cole et al., 2009).",9e1e9123-1cee-442c-8d0e-2f0e4cae77d8
11,abstract11,"  Recent cohort studies demonstrated that MD could be useful also to prevent pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes mellitus (gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)). The diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is based on different criteria: fasting plasma glucose (fasting plasma glucose (FPG)), age, BMI (Schoenaker et al., 2016), and other risk factors (i.e., Personal history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), family history of diabetes, previous macrosomia), (International Association of Diabetes & Pregnancy Study Groups Consensus Panel, 2010). Also, many studies reported that a dietary style far from the MD may contribute to the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Assaf‐Balut et al.",3c959d80-7550-498d-a86e-7f5457b101d1
12,abstract12," reported that a MD intervention in a population of pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was beneficial to achieve a near‐normoglycemia and to make most pregnancy outcomes similar to those of women with normal glucose tolerance (Assaf‐Balut et al., 2017; Assaf‐Balut, Garcia de la Torre, et al., 2018; Assaf‐Balut, García de la Torre, et al., 2018). Izadi et al. explored the effect of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) and MD on the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a population of 460 pregnant women, of which 200 with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). They found that adherence to either Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or the MD is associated with decreased risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (Izadi et al., 2016).

Participation in other studies and the presence of prepregnancy pathologies (i.e., diabetes, hypertension, eating disorder, severe respiratory diseases, severe musculoskeletal disorders, inflammatory bowel diseases) were considered exclusion criteria.  The choice of this population in the first trimester of pregnancy was due to the necessity of an early involvement of pregnant women, in order to help them to follow a healthy lifestyle and to prevent OP and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  In each recruitment center, a trained nutritionist illustrated the project at scheduled meetings which took place from January 2018 to January 2019 and performed the study procedures.",1160d847-7fbd-4d42-a6e5-1b03e0875819

17,methods3,"1 Questionnaire for evaluation of MD adherence  Mediterranean diet adherence was evaluated using a 13‐point score, calculated from a questionnaire, which investigated the consumption of foods and eating habits typical of the MD (Gesteiro et al., 2015). The questionnaire was previously validated by the PREDIMED Study and applied after adjustment for a population of pregnant women. For example, the question about wine consumption was omitted from the original questionnaire used in the PREDIMED Study (Martínez‐González et al., 2012), because alcoholic beverages should not be consumed during pregnancy.  Questions concerned the consumption of olive oil, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, fish and white meat, and dishes with “soffritto” (defined as “sauce made with tomato and onion, leek, or garlic and simmered with olive oil”), which are considered typical MD food. Moreover, the consumption of red and processed meats, fats other than olive oil (i.e.",787640f8-abd4-4ec7-bb9b-5c61ac39cc84
18,methods4,", butter, margarine), carbonated and/or sugar‐sweetened beverages, and commercial sweets or pastries (not homemade) were investigated as incorrect dietary habits, far from the Mediterranean style.  One point was assigned for each answer, according to the correct behavior, and the total score ranged from 0 to 13. The higher the score, the higher the MD adherence. Specifically, a score lower than 7 was considered “low” MD adherence, while a score equal to or higher than 7 was considered “high” MD adherence.  2.3.2 Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) for the evaluation of dietary calcium intake  A semi‐quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) was administered to evaluate dietary calcium intake. It was previously validated for a population of pregnant women in a Mediterranean area (Vioque et al., 2013).",00fb5145-2e8c-40a9-9ffd-69622d23a870
19,methods5," The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) had 25 questions regarding the consumption of specific food groups, which were selected according to the MD, consumption frequency, and importance as a food source of some nutrients, especially calcium.

In particular, a significant difference in the MD score emerged between women with a high school degree (6.85 ± 1.41) and women with an academic degree (7.32 ± 1.80). These results are comparable to others in the literature (Pavičić Žeželj et al., 2018). As reported by Cano‐Ibáñez N. et al. in their cross‐sectional study on subjects with metabolic syndrome, educational level was a variable that significantly influenced a better micronutrient density, as the dietary behavior is healthier in people with a higher educational background and higher socioeconomic status (Cano‐Ibáñez et al., 2019).

30,discussion2," In a cross‐sectional study on 1,051 pregnant women, there were significant differences in the MD score on the basis of educational level, occupation, and age, with women with a higher educational status exhibiting a greater affinity to the MD (Álvarez Álvarez et al., 2015).  The MD adherence score had also a significant inverse correlation with BMI. This result could be explained in different ways. In the first trimester of pregnancy, a higher BMI may be due to a lower MD adherence score, but a lower MD adherence score could also be related to a higher BMI. To our knowledge, higher BMI at the beginning of pregnancy explains the effect of the MD on the risk of developing maternal pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and HDP, representing a variable that directly influences dietary choices and, consequently, a healthier status in pregnant women (Schoenaker et al., 2016).",e15ff38a-efaf-4f1a-8c85-d5468fb306f7
31,discussion3,"  The MD has demonstrated many positive effects on pregnancy outcomes, whether this precedes pregnancy or occurs in pregnant women, and this is particularly true for the prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (Amati et al., 2019; Olmedo‐Requena et al., 2019; Osorio‐Yáñez et al., 2017). In our group, results showed that fast glycaemia at week 10–12 of gestation was significantly different in the two levels of MD adherence, with a higher level of MD adherence resulting in a lower fast glycemia. This parameter could be predictive for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and having a low value of fast glycemia at first trimester could be preventive (Assaf‐Balut, Garcia de la Torre, et al., 2018; Assaf‐Balut, García de la Torre, et al., 2018; Rani & Begum, 2016). Not surprisingly, a lower fast glycemia resulted to be positively correlated in a statistically significant way to lower weight and BMI.",32f93a36-59ee-408f-a6da-599955b43527
32,discussion4,"  Another important aspect that emerged from the results is the link between MD adherence and calcium intake. The semi‐quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) allowed to evaluate the general quality of nutrition and dietary calcium intake. The importance of exploring dietary patterns in pregnant women is widely recognized, in order to examine food choices and evaluate macro‐ and micronutrients deficiencies (Chen et al., 2016). The mean dietary calcium intake from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) was 870.3 ± 335.3: it was significantly lower than Population Reference Intake (PRI) (1,200 mg per day), demonstrating that more information campaigns on this topic are needed to promote maternal and fetus bone health (Hyde, Brennan‐Olsen, Bennett, et al., 2017; Hyde, Brennan‐Olsen, Wark, et al., 2017). Regarding calcium food sources, women said they consumed milk (63.8%), yogurt (73.1%), and cheese (96.1%), but only 15.8% reported drinking calcium‐rich mineral waters.",180b93ca-481b-46e1-942a-407b0ee582ca
33,discussion5," At a time when calcium requirements are higher, a dietary choice in alternative and/or in addition to dairy products, such as calcium‐rich mineral waters, could be useful for meeting those requirements (Vannucci et al., 2018).  A relationship between MD adherence and calcium intake emerged in our data. In fact, there was a significant difference between the two levels of MD adherence and calcium intake: women with higher MD adherence had also a higher intake of calcium. A positive correlation between total MD adherence score and calcium intake was also statistically significant. This is a fascinating and innovative aspect in research on bone health for pregnancy. Although many variables could influence dietary choices and nutrient intake, these data may prove that a beneficial Mediterranean dietary pattern could also be helpful for the intake of micronutrients that are important during pregnancy (i.e., calcium).",fada72f4-34ef-4cb2-a31b-e71a064bb5bc
34,discussion6," Attention to healthy food choices could lead to higher amounts of these essential nutrients. In fact, the reduction in bone mineral density during pregnancy is on average 2%–5%, and a period of 6 months breastfeeding results in the loss of a further 1.5%–4% (Ferrari et al., 2012). Many studies have shown that a mother's lifestyle, body composition, and nutrition are crucial for her bone health, for OP prevention and for the well‐being of the fetus and the newborn (Langdahl, 2017; Marangoni et al., 2016).  Finally, from data collected about lifestyle behavior, it's emerged that only 28% of women practiced regular physical activity (i.e., walking, gym exercises, swimming). Regular exercise during pregnancy has been shown to be beneficial not only for cardiac and pulmonary functions, but also to improve muscle, skeletal, and psychological well‐being (Oliveira et al., 2017).",dcd83eae-c088-4fbb-947f-5945db112477
35,discussion7," The role of PA in gestational weight control is widely recognized, especially for those with an exercise frequency of 3 times per week with a duration of 30 to 45 min (Wang et al., 2019). Furthermore, PA proved to be fundamental for the OP prevention (Moreira et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2016), also during pregnancy. A case–control study by Hadji et al. reported that pregnant women with transient osteoporosis of the hip (the hip (TOH)) had a frequency of immobilization threefold higher compared with the control group (Hadji et al., 2017).  The limitations are due to the study design: this is an observational study and a cause‐effect association between MD, calcium intake and OP prevention could not be established. Moreover, the use of a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) may be subjected to recall bias. Unfortunately, in this study serum vitamin D levels and their potential correlation with glycaemia were not evaluated.",e08fabfa-3c2f-4af0-9697-fe1519e3fe17
36,discussion8," Further clinical studies could be useful to deepen this argument, in order to investigate whether Vitamin D may influence metabolic variables, as fast glycemia. Nevertheless, in this study, two hundred and seventy‐nine women were recruited and the sample size was in line with previous studies with the same characteristics (Groth et al., 2017; Hyde, Brennan‐Olsen, Bennett, et al., 2017; Hyde, Brennan‐Olsen, Wark, et al., 2017; Park et al., 2017). On the basis of this literature, the size of effect was small (Cohen's d = 0.02), the significance level was for p < .05 and the test power resulted to be 0.93, with this sample size.  Moreover, the administrated questionnaires are validated and reproducible through a short‐time interview (15–20 min). This allowed to be inserted as a procedure of the Good Clinical Practice.  5 ",4920ea65-8b1d-467b-842e-2cf8fb1eeee1
37,conclusion0," In conclusion, pregnancy is a delicate period in a woman's life, during which dietary requirements are modified. The evaluation of nutritional habits among pregnant women could be useful to study eventual nutrient deficiencies and to support a healthy pregnancy (Marangoni et al., 2016).  The prevention of chronic diseases, such as osteoporosis, takes place through lifestyle choices. Intervention activities that are focused on nutritional changes and exercise are in the best interest for human health (Perreault et al., 2018).  Mediterranean diet has been proven to be a wholesome dietary pattern and a useful nutrition to prevent bone loss, typical of pregnancy (Ferrari et al., 2012). In fact, the higher was MD adherence, the higher was calcium intake, in this group of Italian women.  MD adherence was also inversely correlated to fast glycaemia: women with a higher level of MD adherence had also a lower fast glycaemia.",7be92170-68e9-4a21-afdb-7a6f9e85237b
38,conclusion1," This could be fundamental for the prevention of pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  Good nutrition for pregnant women is necessary for the improvement of maternal and newborn health. Pregnancy itself it could become a timely phase for correcting dietary choices and improving one's lifestyle. Future interventional clinical trials may clarify the link between MD, calcium intake and OP prevention in pregnancy.  CONFLICT OF INTEREST  B.P., S.Q., G.G., and F.G.: None.
