0,introduction0,"A structured and equilibrated gut microbiome is needed for optimal health status. Factors such as antibiotic use, cesarean-section deliveries, excessive hygiene, stress, and lack of exercise have a major impact on the microbiome (Penders et al., 2006; Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010; Rodríguez et al., 2015). Diet is considered one of the major drivers for gut microbiota composition . A rich and balanced diet is essential to promote the maintenance of diversity and proper functioning of a healthy gut microbiota (Heiman and Greenway, 2016). Nowadays, modern societies are exposed to a “Western lifestyle,” which is characterized by an excessive intake of energy-dense foods rich in fats, cholesterol, animal proteins, sugars, salt and a wide range of processed foods, along with lack of exercise that promote an inflammatory state (Myles, 2014).",d70bd790-deb8-4c1f-8b98-0db723e04106
1,introduction1," This low grade inflammation may trigger the development of several disorders, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, and colorectal cancer . In addition to diet, exercise is another important environmental factor that can influence the gut microbiota composition with possible benefits for human health . The prevalence of obesity is increasing and today more than half of the world’s population is considered to be overweight. We have to take into account that an overweight status is the initial step for obesity development. Overweight is very common in general population. Although many of them are considered “healthy population” if they don’t present any disorder or healthy problem, they are more prone to develop a disease later in life (Biro and Wien, 2010).",3a3954a3-59ef-4215-abc7-e743d2683737
2,introduction2," Nowerdays, most of this human disorders have been associated with alterations in microbiota composition and at same time, a reduced bacterial richness and diversity (Cani et al., 2009; Le Chatelier et al., 2013). Although there is increasing evidence of the influence of several nutrients on gut microbiota composition, the effect on microbiota of a global dietary pattern such as the MD has not been sufficiently studied although there is evidence on beneficial influence of MD on health. It is well assessed the role of MD in preventing non-communicable disorders, as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer . The MD has a greater emphasis on vegetables, fruits and pulses, which are also associated with reduced risk of developing Western diseases .",c0ea741a-30b6-4e47-af47-e1acd3b23eda
3,introduction3," Due to bacterial fermentation of complex carbohydrates present in these groups of foods, a healthy microbiota produces large quantities of biologically active short-chain fatty acids, such as acetate, butyrate and propionate. These positively influence health status . Furthermore, de Filippis and colleagues also reported that high level consumption of plant based foods and high-level adherence to a MD beneficially impacts the gut microbiota and associated metabolomic profile (De Filippis et al., 2016). Despite the relevance of this type of diet to a healthy microbiota, there is little information about the impact of diet and specific dietary components on intestinal microbiota in adults without associated pathology. Feeding pattern and dietary composition are important parameters when assessing the microbiome’s contribution to human metabolism. However, too little is known about the effect of diet and dietary compounds on the microbiota.",b1fec077-d02e-45a3-9e82-66b774fe091a

In any case, we also validated the FFQ with a 3-day food records questionnaire for the intake of dietary nutrients. They were analyzed by EASY DIET program that use the nutrient Food Composition Tables developed by the Centro de Enseñanza Superior de Nutrición Humana y Dietética (Centro de Enseñanza Superior de Nutrición Humana y Dietética (CESNID)). We obtained daily intakes estimates about total energy intake, macro, micronutrients and total dietary fiber. Data were normalyzed by energy intake. As cutoff we used the media of dietary nutrients. We establish that values above the media were considered as a high intake whereas values below the media were considered as low intake.",508587f9-c5bf-4339-a3bc-018cb3b6b820
8,methods3," A 14-item questionnaire, PREDIMED validated test, was also used in this study to appraise adherence of participants to the MD (Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2012). The MD score ranged from 0 (minimal adherence) to 14 (maximal adherence). As cutoff point it was used a score of nine points. A score of nine or more means good adherence to the MD.  Short Chain Fatty Acids (short chain fatty acids (SCFA)) Analysis An aliquot of 100 mg of fecal sample was diluted in 1 ml of phosphoric acid 0.1% as described elsewhere (Sarmiento-Rubiano et al., 2007).

Samples were rarefied to 12.111 reads per sample, and then evaluate for diversity. Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU)s with a relative frequency below 0.01 were removed. Sequences that could not be classified to domain level, or were classified as Cyanobacteria and Chloroplasts, were removed from the dataset as they likely represent ingested plant material. Alpha diversity (Chao1 and Shannon indexes) and beta diversity were also determined.

Moreover, Lefse analysis showed similar significant associations respect to nutrient intakes (P < 0.05). We found an enrichment of Butyricimonas in the group of individuals with low protein, saturated fats, cholesterol and simple sugars and a predominance of Oscillospira in those individuals who consume less proteins and cholesterol. Lefse analysis also showed an association of Roseburia and the intake of vegetal proteins, Haemophilus for all type of proteins, saturated fats and carbohydrates as well as for Coprobacillus and Streptococcus with cholesterol.

Western diets have been associated with less bacterial diversity and different microbial profiles when compared to traditional diets, such as the MD. There is increasing evidence suggesting that the traditional MD and other diets with similarly low animal protein and high vegetable and fiber intake are associated with the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, including reduced mortality risk and lower weight gain . Despite the relevance of diet in microbiota composition and that diet, microbiota, and health are interrelated, there is little information about the impact of dietary patterns and specific components of diet on intestinal microbiota in adults with no associated pathology.",bfd77fea-1858-4fa3-a9f4-cb1d11206419
26,discussion1,"  BMI Stratification The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the maintenance of host health. Several studies have linked changes (dysbiosis) in the gut microbial community to metabolic disorders, such as obesity and insulin resistance (Le Chatelier et al., 2013). Many previous works have shown associations between various bacterial groups and weight status (Bajzer and Seeley, 2006; Ley et al., 2006; Clarke et al., 2012). In any case, there are some controversies about the composition of gut microbial communities in obese individuals. In our study, Verrucomicrobia phylum was significantly more abundant in the normal weight group, as previously reported . As our results showed, members of the family Christensenellaceae and the genera Desulfovibrio and Oscillospira were more abundant in lean individuals.",54a91f5c-4903-44c5-bb34-5c4d3ac8c8a4
27,discussion2," Karlsson and colleagues conducted a study on overweight children showing that the reduction of certain bacterial groups, such as Desulfovibrio and Akkermansia muciniphila-like bacteria, resulted in an increase in pathogens, such as members of gram-negative family Enterobacteriaceae identified as biomarkers in the development of obesity . Moreover, Oscillospira has been widely positively associated with leanness , in both children and adults, including twin studies . Bacteria species providing anti-inflammatory effects, as F. prausnitzii, are found in lean people, whereas those with pro-inflammatory effects were more likely to be present in obese individuals . Walters and colleagues found lower levels of Oscillospira in patients with inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn’s and inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)) .",2199836c-fed2-47fa-ac55-bdb998c8c13f
28,discussion3," In addition, it has been also found a strong association involving Oscillospira with Christensenella minuta, which promoted leanness in inoculated germ-free mice .  Mediterranean Diet (MD)-Score Stratification There is growing evidence that the MD is beneficial to human health. Large cohort studies have demonstrated that good adherence to MD is related to reduced risk of developing several disorders, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Mendez et al., 2006; Lopez-Legarrea et al., 2014). These also showed that the MD is related to reduced inflammation markers . Mediterranean dietary patterns may be an important dietary tool against obesity (Newby et al., 2004; Schulz et al., 2005; Mendez et al., 2006). In this study, a higher presence of Bacteroidetes and a lower Firmicutes–Bacteroidetes ratio was found in individuals who consumed less animal protein and who had a higher MD score.",739c8100-513d-40c3-bf62-649b1461cebd
29,discussion4," A high Firmicutes–Bacteroidetes ratio has been related to several disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) , type 2 diabetes  and obesity . Nevertheless, no significant differences were found in levels of Bacteroides and Prevotella, genus included in Bacteroidetes phyla. In a cross-sectional study , it has been shown that people who followed a long term meat-rich diet had greater amounts of Bacteroides compared to those whose diets were rich in carbohydrates, who had higher counts of Prevotella. However, it is also known that Bacteroides possess hydrolytic abilities, which are involved in the degradation of insoluble polysaccharides. This makes them good gut colonizers , that are able to degrade a wide variety of polysaccharides. Most of the findings on the MD described here are in agreement with previous studies.",5512b580-8af9-45d4-84bd-630a5411a07c
30,discussion5," A recent study reported higher proportions of Bacteroidetes in those subjects with better adherence to the MD (Gutiérrez-Díaz et al., 2016). In another work comparing the fecal microbiota of EU children with children from a rural African village, those whose diets were higher in fiber content had significantly higher levels of Bacteroidetes and a unique abundance of bacteria from the genus Prevotella and Xylanibacter (De Filippo et al., 2010). We found that lower adherence to the MD was associated to lower levels of Catenibacterium genus. Recent study explored differences in gut microbial composition in two groups of teenagers (Egypt vs. United States) according to their diets . The guts of Egyptian adolescents were enriched with polysaccharide-degrading genera including Catenibacterium .",928265da-16ef-4d03-ac7f-c2201e79326a

However, the biological implications of this remain unclear. Interestingly, we found a significant association between Christensenellaceae levels and better MD adherence as well as lower BMI. As previously described, Christensenellaceae has been associated with lean subjects  as it has been found in higher abundance in the gut microbiome of lean people compared to those of obese people. Another study  reported lower levels of Christensenellaceae in fecal samples of pediatric and young adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients compared with those of healthy controls. However, until now no relationship has been found between Christensenellaceae and human diet.",1fde2eb1-de02-4847-9a74-5f3ad1f1818e
32,discussion7," This is an important finding of this study, because in addition to find an association of Christensenellaceae with lean individuals, we could also detect this association in those individuals who presented a better dietary pattern. In support of previous research , this study showed a relationship between higher levels of Streptococcaceae and Streptococcus and lower adherence to the MD. A relationship between high levels of these bacteria was also found with higher BMI. A high-fat diet, which contrasts the dietary pattern of the MD, greatly increased the relative abundance of Streptococcaceae, especially bacteria belonging to the genus Streptococcus. A long-term high-fat diet may produce not only an increase in inflammatory status but also an increase in Lachnospiraceae and Streptococcaceae bacteria in C57BL/6 mice . It is well established that diet influences our health status.",0eadadf2-6232-4d64-b5e4-6b1c5e8bb24e
33,discussion8," But until now has been unclear the contribution of microbiota to this effect. Curiously, in our study we could observed the same associations between some bacterial groups, for weight status as well as for MD adherence. This indicates that diet, health status, and microbiota may be interrelated.  Dietary Nutrient Intakes Animal protein, saturated fats, and simple sugars are nutritional components commonly found in the Western dietary pattern. This study found that high consumption of these nutrients was associated with a decrease in microbial richness and diversity. These results are in agreement with previous findings . There is increasing evidence suggesting that the overuse of antibiotics, clinical practices, and the type of diet usually associated with modern lifestyles promote changes in the human gut microbiota. This seriously affects microbial diversity (De Filippo et al., 2010; Yatsunenko et al.",e98113eb-ee5b-4350-a6f7-be0c353d305c

Low fiber intake is likely to lead not only to a reduction in gut microbial composition and diversity but also to a reduction in the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), which has important beneficial properties for human health (Jew et al., 2009; Huda-Faujan et al., 2010; O’Keefe et al., 2015; Sonnenburg et al., 2016; Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg, 2014). In accordance with previous studies, this study shows associations between the nutritional components of traditional Mediterranean-style diets, certain groups of beneficial bacteria, and fermentable end products . Also in agreement with the literature, higher total short chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations were found in individuals with a higher MD score (Gutiérrez-Díaz et al., 2016).",8e02a018-174e-42ac-b0ae-1383b9a5fa9d

These two groups are Oscillospira and Butyricimonas. Here, negative correlations were found between these groups and energy intake, animal proteins, saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates. Butyricimonas is a butyric-acid-producing genus of the phylum Bacteroidetes (Konikoff and Gophna, 2016; Shin et al., 2016). Oscillospira has been related with health and leanness (Konikoff and Gophna, 2016). In addition, recent works showed that Africans tend to have a higher level of Oscillospira, which might be involved in the assimilation of non- digestible carbohydrates . The MD contains a large proportion of vegetal food compounds.",2062da07-040e-4093-b9cb-8a34c68ad1b7
36,discussion11," In addition, at higher levels of vegetal food compounds intakes, such as vegetal proteins, polysaccharides and dietary fiber, there were significantly higher bifidobacterial counts and significant positive correlations with various groups of butyrate-producing bacteria within the fecal microbial composition, along with higher concentrations of total short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Some studies report similar shifts in gut microbiota and metabolic profile in association with consumption of these nutritional components (Lopez-Legarrea et al., 2014; Gutiérrez-Díaz et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2017). Dietary proteins affect gut microbiota differently depending on the source . Two recent works reported that consumption of plant protein increased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera, decreased the pathogenic bacterial species of Bacteroides and Clostridium genera, and increased short chain fatty acids (SCFA)s .",0a84a49e-9558-4b62-ab74-8fb84b2bf800
37,discussion12," Moreover, there are studies showing that a high animal protein/low carbohydrate diet reduced bacterial groups including Roseburia and Eubacterium, which are well known butyrate producers . Correlations were found between vegetal proteins and other butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Dorea and Coprococcus. Vegetal proteins were also correlated with higher counts (qPCR) of Bifidobacterium. All of these bacteria also had relationships with higher amounts of short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Carbohydrates, especially non-digestible carbohydrates such as fiber and resistant starch, have been described  as having the highest impact of all nutritional components on gut microbiota composition, diversity, and metabolic profile. They exert a prebiotic potential, which stimulates the activity and growth of some specific groups of bacteria, for example Bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria.",a62a38d7-0903-44ab-ae08-e207bd38df99
38,discussion13," When they reach the large intestine, they are fermented by microbes producing short chain fatty acids (SCFA)s, which play an important role in human health. The MD is characterized by high consumption of foods that are sources of prebiotics, such as pulses, vegetables, whole grains, and fruit. A strong positive correlation was found in this study between short chain fatty acids (SCFA)s levels and MD score, as previously reported (Gutiérrez-Díaz et al., 2016, 2017). Moreover, studies have proven not only that plant based diets are linked to an increase in Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. but also that they can stimulate the growth of other beneficial bacterial species, especially bacterial communities involved in butyrate and methane production (Lockyer and Nugent, 2017). It has been reported that Eubacterium rectale, F. prausnitzii, Roseburia spp.",9a35fdb6-3569-4f88-b961-83c1b76a72a7
39,discussion14,", Dorea and Coprococcus consume plant-vegetables to produce the short chain fatty acids (SCFA) (Rajilić-Stojanović de Vos, 2014; Rivière et al., 2016). Most of these bacterial groups were also associated with better cardiometabolic profile . Although Bifidobacteria produce acetic and lactic acid as main fermentation end products, they are implicated in butyrate production as a result of cross-feeding interactions between bifidobacteria and butyrate producing bacteria. This could mean that the presence of one group could favor the colonization of other bacteria . This is in line with findings from the current study, which showed that consumption of plant-based nutrients was associated with the presence of Bifidobacterium as well as with some butyrate producers.  Study Limitations Limitations of this study include sample size, which could have affected the statistical power of the study.",bf24babb-02fd-4029-9a18-36feeab93064
40,discussion15," Furthermore, the FFQ was chosen because is the most complete tool to estimate intakes over an extended period of time (Serra Majem et al., 2006). However, it may have introduced bias caused by errors in memory and perception of food proportion sizes. Additionally, the FFQ is dependent on regular eating habits. It is also important to take into account, that it is very difficult to evaluate the influence of a dietary pattern only by dietary intakes analysis. There is increasing evidence that suggest that healthy dietary patterns are usually associated with other healthy-related habits. Moreover, the impact of environmental factors, including aspects of lifestyle, such as exercise or chronic stress on microbiota are also not studied in this work. Despite these limitations and the fact that more work is needed, the findings of this study are useful as they may help to promote further research in the field of dietary strategies, microbiota, and health.",c8069f76-4200-4a85-b7d3-c94c5d198a1e
41,discussion16,"  Conclusion In conclusion, the main findings of this study showed that specific nutritional components and dietary patterns influence gut microbiota composition, diversity and activity. Associations were found between certain bacterial groups, weight and MD adherence. This means that nutritional strategies may have an influence on physiology and health through the microbiota. This study highlights the relevance of dietary components in the activity and composition of the microbiome in non-pathological adult individuals. Therefore, it is necessary to increase knowledge of the diet–microbiota interaction in order to design dietary strategies aimed to modulate the microbiota and at the same time to reduce the risk of disease.
