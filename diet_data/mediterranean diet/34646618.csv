Dietary approaches to stop hypertension adherence score was calculated following the method by Fung et al. (22), which was based on foods and nutrients namely, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy, sodium, red and processed meats, and sweetened beverages. The participants received 1 point for those in the lowest quintile and 5 points for those in the highest quintile of intakes of fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy products, and whole grains, according to the quintile rankings. Those with the lowest quintile of intake of sodium, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats received a score of 5 and those in the highest quintile received a score of 1.",cedf806c-114f-4fd0-b8da-73ac2df685b7
5,methods5," The scores were totaled with a possible score range from 8 (lowest adherence) to 40 (greatest adherence).  According to the method of Sofi et al. (23), adherence to MD scores was calculated, for fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, legumes, and fish, “0”, “1”, “2” points for the lowest, middle, highest category, separately. In contrast, for red meat and meat products, “2”, “1”, “0” points for the lowest, middle, highest category, separately; and for alcohol, which gets a score of “0” for >24 g, “1” for <12 g, and “2” for 12–24 g of intake per day. The MD scores in this study were calculated by using gram intakes. However, the fruits and vegetable variables were reported as cup equivalent (CE) intakes, as gram intakes were not available, the score for vegetables and fruits was calculated by referring to K.",98508eb8-0bfa-4f2b-9b17-4630ad3d168a

7,methods7,"  Definition of physical activity  On the basis of the PA Guidelines for Americans, PA was divided into four categories (26): sedentary (doing no regular PA), insufficient (doing some regular PA, but not meeting the minimum standards of the guidelines), moderate (500–1,000 MET-minutes of PA per week), and high (≥1,000 MET-minutes of PA per week).  Stimulant use  The data on stimulant use was obtained from self-reports (16). Children with stimulant use were defined as participants who reported use of amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, or lisdexamfetamine. Children without stimulant use were defined as participants who did not report the use of these medications.  Covariates  The baseline variables included the following: age, gender, body mass index (body mass index (BMI), kg/m2), race, family income, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (nmol/L), and serum cotinine (ng/mL).",a5bcfb34-3f55-4172-92b0-b14fe588e2a6

The association of dietary patterns and physical activity on bone mineral content, bone mineral density in children with stimulant use and non-stimulant use  The univariate linear-regression analysis was used to explore the possible confounding factors in the association of the DPs and PA on bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in children.

Table 4 showed the differences in the association of DPs and PA on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) between the non-stimulant use group and stimulant use group. For stimulant use group, the MD was positively associated with total femur bone mineral density (BMD), total femur bone mineral content (BMC), femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD), and femoral neck bone mineral content (BMC) [β = 8.75, 95% confidence interval (CI):4.90–32.59; β = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.41–2.46; β = 5.38, 95% CI: 2.19–28.56; β = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.04–0.25], but there was no statistical correlation among non-stimulant use group (P > 0.05), except the total femur bone mineral content (BMC) (β = 0.29, 95% CI:0.03–0.55; P < 0.05).",0fb34e8a-9cec-416e-9152-a0e182cd90da

16,discussion0," In this study, we investigated the influence of DPs and PA on bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis in children with stimulant use and non-stimulant use. The study found that adherence to the MD and high PA had positively associated with bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC), and only high PA may be correlated with a decreased risk of osteoporosis among children with stimulant use. Our finding indicated that children with stimulant use should be more concerned about the role of high PA on bone health.  In general, stimulants are the most commonly used psychopharmacologic drugs to treat Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, stimulants could increase sympathetic tone and affect bone remodeling (16). Attention to the bone health of children with stimulant use is critical.",82b8df2f-276b-4053-968d-674be46a86d8
17,discussion1," Previous studies have reported that PA is one of the most important factors affecting peak bone mass during childhood, which is consistent with our findings. High PA could increase the bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD), and decrease the risk of osteoporosis among children with or without stimulant use. One review reported the influence of genetic, fetal, and environmental on bone mass acquisition among healthy children, and indicated the importance of PA in the process of bone mass acquisition (27). Mechanical signals, as the main component of PA, could promote anabolism in bones and muscles. Dynamic ground-reaction force generated by PA transmit a series of signals in bone and muscle tissue, making the cells, tissues, and organs to mechanically strain and accelerate, thereby causing increased muscle mass, bone mineralization, and reduced systemic inflammation (28).",487f6869-03aa-42a1-9cb2-e7b990b019c2
18,discussion2," In a similar manner, a high level of PA has also been shown to be closely related to effectively improving bone mineral density (BMD), even in people with a poor genetic predisposition in development of bone. One study has confirmed that high PA in early life might enhance hip strength and prevent osteoporosis later in life (29). Not only that, Marin-Puyalto et al. also reported that vigorous PA played a pivotal role in improving bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) among adolescent boys, with a greater benefit if they keep the periods of vigorous PA longer or more frequent (30). These studies showed that high PA seems to be one of the most effective means of bone growth, which suggested that children should be encouraged to do high physical activity as appropriate, such as participating in group activities and outdoor activities, learning sports, and developing the habit of exercising.",8b53d556-4c56-4d6f-869f-96d6c6ccb108
19,discussion3,"  It is well known that MD is characterized by rich in fruits and vegetables, cereals, small amounts of red meat, lower sugar, and saturated fatty acids, which has attracted great attention in terms of its impact on human health. A meta-analysis showed that the adherence to MD was associated with a reduced risk of fracture and higher mean bone mineral density (BMD), this may be due to the greater adherence to MD might decrease the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6), which caused the lower rate of bone resorption (31). Although several studies suggested that adherence to MD was related to a lower incidence of osteoporosis and increased bone mineral density (BMD), few studies assessed the association of MD and bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC) to date among children with stimulant use.",8afc5214-a329-4a30-80a1-9f97172c9caf
20,discussion4," In the study, the adherence to MD was associated with total femur bone mineral density (BMD), total femur bone mineral content (BMC), femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD), and femoral neck bone mineral content (BMC) in children with stimulant use, but it’s worth noting that MD was not statistically correlated with lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC), this is inconsistent with previous research (31), which is probably because of the different study populations included, lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in children were significantly affected by their height and body mass index (BMI) (32). In addition, our study found that dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) adherence was associated with lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) in children without stimulant use but not in children with stimulant use. In a cross-sectional study by Noel et al.",02fb5753-55a7-4541-8466-0b0576c40e23
21,discussion5," (33), they also reported that dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) was the strongest predictor of bone mineral density (BMD); because the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score emphasizes low-fat dairy product intake and limits sodium intake. Intake of low-fat dairy products has been considered to be associated with improved bone mineral density (BMD) (34), and intake of lower sodium reduces urinary calcium excretion, which contributes to the bone health (35). However, this relationship between dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score and bone mineral density (BMD) has not been significant in children with stimulant use, which may be related to the smaller sample size included (n = 222); moreover, we speculated that stimulant use affects the effect of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) patterns on bone. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate our findings.",3a5e59b1-8faa-4fbf-bf67-d70b060b32d4
22,discussion6,"  Compared with previous studies, our study showed the advantage and highlighted the influence of DPs and PA on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC), and osteoporosis in children with stimulant use, which might be of higher practical value to enhance the bone content and decrease the occurrence of osteoporosis. However, our study does have limitations. First, the present research had a relatively small sample size of children with stimulant use, this could be due to the fact that our sample data was derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Moreover, the cross-sectional design of the study, cannot demonstrate the causality between DPs and PA on bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), and osteoporosis, as a consequence, more trials still are needed to explore this association.",bf87c75d-415d-49ce-9b9d-5204f7e952cf
23,discussion7,"  Conclusion  Improved adherence to MD, dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH), AHEI, or increased PA may increase bone mineral density (BMD), and bone mineral content (BMC) and reduce the risk of osteoporosis; the children with stimulant use should improve adherence to MD and do more PA compared to the children without stimulant use.
