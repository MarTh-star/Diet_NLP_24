Patients with current or previous history of HBV or HCV infections were also excluded. A structured interview about alcohol consumption habits was performed at enrolment by the same physician for all patients. The interview was repeated at a time distance of a median of two years by a trained Medicine Student by telephone call.",65b64bc7-1b85-475c-b965-318138001d7e
1,methods1," The interview included questions on current and lifetime alcohol consumption besides pattern and quality of alcoholic beverages to verify the reproducibility and reliability of the reported information about life-long alcohol intake. Of 300 patients, 11 were excluded due to the impossibility to perform the second interview and 13 were excluded due to a poor reliability on lifetime alcohol use, as the answers given in the two abovementioned interviews were greatly different. We thus present data on 276 patients. Patients underwent an accurate physical examination with recording of height, weight and waist measurements without shoes and with light clothing. Arterial blood pressure was recorded after a five-minute resting period. A full physiological and pathological history was recorded.",661ff85c-7467-4bde-8a76-226ddca12cdb

Insuline-resistance was defined as HOMA (homeostasis model assessment) index > 2.5 in at least two determinations. Arterial hypertension was defined as previously diagnosed, ongoing or previous pharmacological treatment for hypertension or finding of blood pressure > 135/90 mmHg on two separate occasions. Coffee and soft drink servings per week were estimated using a quantitative food frequency questionnaire: one soft drink serving was defined as 200 mL of beverage and one coffee serving was defined as one “espresso” (small coffee cup).",cb2d72fa-8a55-41fc-81c8-5282114b6107
3,methods3," Weekly physical activity during the year before the first visit was evaluated using a quantitative questionnaire: up to 30 min of leisure-time physical activity were classified as 1 (scarce), 30–90 min were classified as 2 (moderate) and more than 90 min were classified as 3 (good). Patients were also divided into non-smokers and smokers according to whether had never or ever smoked. For the latter group, exposition to cigarette smoke was quantified in pack-years, defined as twenty cigarettes smoked every day for one year.  Alcohol consumption evaluation: paralleling smoke exposition, we created a new tool, called Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU) (Lifetime Alcohol Consuming Unit) to estimate the cumulative amount of alcohol consumed in lifetime by our patients.  We chose to consider weekly instead of daily alcohol use to correctly evaluate social drinkers who usually drink more during the weekends.",bb2fdcce-3f07-4bc3-bef2-a04b94fe188a

Quantitative evaluation:Current use:  Our study included patients who reported a weekly alcohol consumption < 210 g for men and <140 g for women. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to ongoing alcohol use: A (abstainers, < 1 g per week), C1 (low consumers, 1–70 g per week) and C2 (moderate consumers, 71–210 g per week for men and 71–140 g per week for women).  2. Lifetime alcohol consumption units (Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU)):  Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU) definition: 1 Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU) was considered as 7 alcohol units per week for 1 drinking year from teenage onwards.

In particular, patients were classified as cirrhotic if they had imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic resonance) features of cirrhosis and/or histology or elastosonographic evidence of F4 fibrosis (corresponding to a liver stiffness > 13.0 kPa).  Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Il, USA). Categorical data are presented as number (percentage) and were compared using the Chi-square test. Continuous data are presented as median (range) and were compared with Mann-Whitney test.

Results  The characteristics of the cohort of 276 patients are reported in Table 1 and are in line with the usual population for Italian Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Patients were overweight (median BMI 29), middle aged (median 59 years), often hypertensive (57.2%) and diabetic (26.8%) or with insulin-resistance (median HOMA 2.3). Prevalence of cirrhosis (20.3%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (11.6%) were higher than in the usual Italian Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) population as our unit is a hepatology tertiary referral centre.  3.1. Comparison of Patients According to Current Alcohol Intake  Active alcohol consumers were more frequently males (69.0% vs. 37.6%, p < 0.",893e9bbd-4b0a-412c-999c-ebb293c73c45

No differences were detected in BMI or frequency of arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia or diabetes though abstainers showed higher levels of glycosylated haemoglobin (48 mmol/mol vs. 41 mmol/mol, p = 0.05). No significant differences emerged between the two groups regarding alimentary habits or leisure physical activity apart from a slightly higher coffee consumption in the drinkers group (p = 0.04). Regarding laboratory parameters, the only differences were a lower ferritin and a higher HDL cholesterol serum level in abstainers compared to active drinkers (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03 respectively). No differences were detected in ultrasound parameters or HIS between current abstainers and drinkers.",d6d3f16c-b9f1-40c3-bbc3-6bb1899fcbe0
9,methods9," All non-invasive markers of fibrosis (NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), FIB4, two-dimensional transient elastography) were comparable between abstainers and current drinkers, whereas clinical detection of cirrhosis was more frequent in current abstainers (28.3% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.02). hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was equally represented in the two groups.  We then analysed different current drinkers subgroups: C1 were younger than abstainers (p < 0.01) and C2 (p < 0.001) while male sex was more represented in C2 (p < 0.001 vs. abstainers and C1). No differences were detected in BMI, frequency of arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia or diabetes, although HOMA index in non-diabetic patients was slightly higher in C2 compared to C1 (p = 0.02). Smoking exposure, leisure physical activity and alimentary habits were also similar.",4c81b110-8b55-48ff-ae05-6c5c3a5f198d
10,methods10," Exclusive wine and spirits consumption was equally represented in the two drinkers groups whereas beer (both exclusive and overall) was consumed more frequently in C1 and overall wine and spirits were consumed more frequently in C2. A binge-drinking pattern was reported more frequently in C2 (p = 0.01). As for laboratory parameters, ferritin was slightly higher in C2 than in C1 and abstainers (p = 0.03 for both) and in C1 compared to abstainers (p = 0.03). HSI was comparable among groups. Despite similar FIB4 values, NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) was lower in C1 compared to C2 (p = 0.01). 2D-SWE was lower in C1 compared to abstainers (p = 0.002) and C2 (p < 0.001). Accordingly, C1 showed the lowest frequency of cirrhosis (p = 0.001 vs. abstainers and p = 0.003 vs. C2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (p = 0.009 vs. abstainers and p < 0.001 vs. C2). No difference in the prevalence of cirrhosis emerged between abstainers and C2.",64bd4029-b9cd-41ae-8e4e-fc1e202db9ad

Comparison of Patients According to Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU) Status  Table 3 shows the characteristics of the whole cohort of 276 patients divided between lifetime abstainers and alcohol consumers (including current and past consumers). Alcohol consumers were more frequently males and a higher proportion of them has been a cigarette-smoker, with a comparable overall toxic exposure between the smokers of the two groups according to pack-years estimation. Alcohol abstainers were more often affected by diabetes mellitus (p = 0.03) with higher levels of glycosylated haemoglobin (p = 0.02).",a06d1a4e-1fb3-4cb6-ae50-02b2e3fe463a
12,methods12," No significant differences emerged between the two groups regarding the other features of the metabolic syndrome (arterial hypertension, obesity or dyslipidemia), alimentary habits (coffee or soft drinks consumption) or leisure physical activity. Alcohol consumers showed higher serum ferritin and urate levels (p = 0.02 for both). No differences were detected in non-invasive markers of fibrosis (NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), FIB-4) or steatosis (HIS) and similarly, two-dimensional transient elastography was comparable between the two groups. Among ultrasound parameters, subcutaneous fat tissue was slightly thicker in abstainers (21 mm vs. 19 mm, p = 0.02) with no differences in visceral fat. Cirrhosis was detected slightly more often in alcohol abstainers (28.0% vs. 17.4%, p = 0.05) at variance from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) whose frequency was similar in the two groups. To summarize, a low alcohol intake did not appear to be detrimental in general.",43698378-9929-42a2-b689-f90ae14d6d7e
13,methods13," However, despite all considered subthreshold for determining cirrhosis as single etiologic agent, the group of alcohol consumers was very heterogeneous. Therefore, alcohol consumers were divided into 4 groups (namely Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) using quartile range according to lifetime exposure to alcohol as determined by Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU). Patients included in the quartiles from 1 to 3 displayed highly homogeneous characteristics concerning demography, laboratory and clinical features, while Q4 showed different values. Therefore, we decided to aggregate the first three quartiles into a unique group named Q1–Q3 and to consider them altogether. Characteristics of the single quartiles are available in Table S5.  Patients in Q4 were older than lifetime abstainers and Q1–Q3 (Table 3). Male gender was more frequently represented in any drinking group than in abstainers and in Q4 compared to Q1–Q3.",1902208d-6435-4b16-9dff-a3b4d5280542
14,methods14," No differences among abstainers and any drinking group were detected as for BMI, leisure activity and alimentary habits. Arterial hypertension was more frequently detected in Q4 compared to Q1–Q3, diabetes mellitus was less represented in Q1–Q3 compared to abstainers. Dyslipidemia was equally represented in the subgroups and no differences were detected in HOMA index in non-diabetic patients. Current alcohol consumption was higher in Q4 compared to Q1–Q3 (p < 0.001). Exclusive wine and spirits consumption was equally represented in the two drinkers groups whereas beer (both exclusive and overall) was consumed more frequently in Q1–3 and overall wine and spirits were consumed more frequently in Q4. A binge-drinking pattern was reported more frequently in Q4 (p = 0.002). Despite an overall comparable exposure to cigarette smoke, smoking subjects in Q4 reported a slightly higher consumption, as estimated by pack-years calculation, compared to Q1–Q3 = (p 0.02).",47008d1f-e7f5-4b9f-a0a0-4e31c0355504
15,methods15," As for laboratory parameters, no differences emerged in glycosylated haemoglobin, serum lipid levels, ALT, AST and gammaGT, urea and serum electrolytes levels. Ferritin was higher in Q4 compared to other subgroups and urate levels were lower in Q4 compared to Q1–3. HIS was comparable among all subgroups. Among ultrasound parameters, subcutaneous adipose tissue was thicker in abstainers compared to Q4 (p = 0.007), with no significant differences in visceral adipose tissue. We then assessed the relationship between different degrees of alcohol exposure and markers of fibrosis. All fibrosis diagnostic markers consistently showed the lowest values in Q1–3. In particular, NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), FIB4 and proportion of patients with clinically evident cirrhosis were lower in Q1–Q3 compared to both abstainers and Q4 (both NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) and cirrhosis clinical evaluation p = 0.003 vs. abstainers, p < 0.001 vs. Q4, FIB4 p = 0.01 vs. abstainers, p < 0.001 vs. Q4).",9b4d35df-757b-4044-917b-bca54a5e4c64

Indeed, also hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prevalence significantly differed between abstainers and Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU) subgroups. Q4 displayed the highest prevalence of the disease compared to all the other categories (p = 0.006 vs. abstainers, p < 0.001 vs. Q1–Q3) but abstainers had higher hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequency than Q1–Q3 (p < 0.001).  Figure 2 shows the frequency of advanced liver disease in our cohort of patients according to Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU), showing lower prevalence in Q1–Q3.  We then analysed separately the binge drinkers subgroup, that included 35 patients. Compared to non-binge drinkers, binge drinkers were older (median age 62 vs. 58 years, p = 0.03), more frequently males (88.2% vs. 82.9%, p = 0.04), had drunk alcohol for a longer period of time (median 30 vs.",ba3a5a96-bb41-4092-a207-fbe19777d209

Overall wine and beer, and exclusive beer and spirits consume were equally represented in binge and non-binge cohorts, whereas wine was exclusively consumed less frequently by binge compared to non-binge drinkers (20% vs. 39.8%, p = 0.03) and spirits were overall consumed more frequently by binge compared to non-binge drinkers (54.3% vs. 25.3%, p < 0.001). Anthropometric features, co-morbidities, lifestyle habits, laboratory parameters and non-invasive fibrosis markers (NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), FIB-4 and 2D-SWE) were comparable between the two groups. No differences were noticed in the frequency of cirrhosis (20.0% vs. 16.9%, p = n.s.) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (17.1% vs. 9.0%, p = n.s.).

As for laboratory parameters, HDL cholesterol was higher in ex drinkers compared to current drinkers (55 mg/dL vs. 47 mg/dL, p = 0.004), while ferritin levels were in between the two groups (95 ng/mL), with no significant differences.

Wine was consumed by a total of 165 patients (82.1%), mostly in association with spirits and/or beer (92 subjects, 45.8%). To better evaluate the role of modest amount of wine in our patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), we considered patients reporting drinking exclusively wine and compared them to abstainers and patients not drinking wine; as laboratory parameters did not differ significantly between groups, these data are not reported (Table 4).  Wine was consumed exclusively by 73 patients (36.3%). Compared to non-wine drinkers (36 subjects: 28 exclusively beer-drinkers, 7 exclusively spirits drinkers and one consumer of beer plus spirits), wine consumers were similar for sex, BMI distribution, frequency of arterial hypertension and diabetes, though they were older (median age 65 vs. 40 years, p < 0.001), less physically active (1.19 vs. 1.52, p = 0.",5fe239c5-217e-4863-8062-15e300bd6b8d

Wine exclusive drinkers displayed higher values of non-invasive fibrosis markers (median NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) −0.91 vs. −2.37, p = 0.001, median FIB-4 1.32 vs. 0.73, p = 0.009, median 2D-SWE 6.1 kPa vs. 5.7 kPa, p = 0.04). Overall cirrhosis was detected in 13 exclusive wine drinkers (17.8%) and in 2 non-wine drinkers (5.6%), p not significant; no hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were reported in non-wine drinkers whereas 8 cases were detected in exclusive wine drinkers (11.0%).  Beer was consumed exclusively by 28 patients (13.9%). Compared non-beer drinkers (108 subjects: 73 exclusively wine drinkers, 7 exclusively spirits drinkers and 28 consumers of wine plus spirits), beer drinkers were younger (median age 41 vs. 65, p < 0.",a302de8a-2a9d-4cc7-a2b6-57618f560a5c

Among exclusive spirits consumers, cirrhosis was detected in 2 patients (28.6%) without any hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) case.  3.3. Association between Patient Characteristics and Advanced Liver Disease  3.3.1. Cirrhosis  Factors associated with advanced fibrosis included higher age, greater waist circumference and BMI, higher levels of HbA1c, gammaGT and AST, Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU) (but not current alcohol consumption), smoking exposure as quantified by pack-years, history of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus (Table 5). More intense leisure physical activity and beer consumption were found to be associated to less advanced fibrosis.",9f0dd722-96c2-44ce-9b4a-8d12c27f797f
23,methods23," Cirrhotic patients were found to have lower serum levels of cholesterol, albumin and platelet, which should be held as manifestations of cirrhosis rather than risk factors.  On multivariate logistic regression analysis (Table 6), presence of cirrhosis was confirmed to be positively associated to older age and a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus while very low current (C1) or lifelong (Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU) Q1–Q3) alcohol intake appeared to be protective compared to complete abstinence. At variance, a higher alcohol consumption, but always in the range of the Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) definition, was found to be possibly harmful when protracted lifelong.  3.3.2. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC))  Overall, 32 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were detected in our cohort of patients, in 10 cases non associated with cirrhosis.",87d2202d-3496-4ba6-a0bd-8d7c51339fb6
24,methods24," Factors associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) included older age, male gender, history of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, alcohol consumption as evaluated by current alcohol use, Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU) and drinking years, overall spirits consumption and presence of cirrhosis. More intense leisure physical activity and beer consumption were found to be associated to lower hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequency (Table 7).  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients were found to have lower serum levels of total cholesterol, albumin and platelet and higher levels of gammaGT and AST but these findings probably reflect a higher proportion of patients with advanced liver disease.",d4c683a2-927f-4d59-a31f-c924ad252949
25,methods25,"  On multivariate logistic regression analysis (Table 8), presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was confirmed to be positively associated with older age, male sex, history of cirrhosis and arterial hypertension (all known risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)), whereas a very low current (C1) and lifetime (Q1–3) alcohol intake was associated with a reduced frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to complete abstinence.  4. Discussion  Fatty liver is the hepatic manifestation of a systemic metabolic dysfunction, which is heterogeneous in its underlying conditions, presentation, course and outcomes. Considering its direct hepato-toxic effect, moderate alcohol consumption has been considered detrimental in patients with underlying chronic liver diseases of different origin, including Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), for a long time, regardless of any level of alcohol intake.",26f4fde7-ad9a-4e01-bc75-6a22308ce8f1
26,methods26," In the last decades a great amount of data reporting a J-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and extra-hepatic events (as all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease) has been reported, with a moderate alcohol consumption (1–2 units per day) associated with better outcomes compared to abstainers [19,20], even in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients [21]. Similarly, data of a possible beneficial effect of very modest amount of alcohol on the course of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are accumulating, creating a hot controversy about alcohol consumption in these patients [10,11].  In this study, we examined 276 patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) at their first visit in our tertiary hepatology centre. We evaluated the association between lifestyle, alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome features and the severity of liver disease, namely cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.",aab7bac9-07a2-42be-8ca3-4dfde88b69ca
27,methods27," For a more accurate evaluation of overall alcohol exposure, besides current alcohol consumption (expressed as units per week), that could be influenced by recent conditions including the awareness of liver disease, we designed a new parameter, that we called Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU) (Lifetime Alcohol Consumption Units). One Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU) was defined as 7 alcoholic units (70 g of pure alcohol) per week for one year. We chose this parameter paralleling the pack/years used to estimate the toxic exposure to cigarette smoking and we decided to use weekly instead of daily amount of alcohol to correctly evaluate social drinkers that preferably consume alcohol during weekends.",3c9424dc-67e2-43aa-a88d-2e5f6f21494f
28,methods28,"  In our cohort of patients fulfilling Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) criteria (daily ethanol consumption < 210 g in men and <140 g in women and exclusion of other known causes of liver disease), a very low alcohol use, far below the subthreshold amount, as either current or lifelong exposure, was associated with a lower frequency of cirrhosis at univariate and multivariate analysis, compared to both abstainers and moderate consumers (corresponding to C2 and Q4).  In multivariate analysis, a low lifetime alcohol exposure (Lifetime alcohol consumption units (LACU)) was also independently associated with a reduced prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to both abstainers and moderate consumers. This was evident for lifetime but not for current consume, suggesting a possible protective effect for a chronic very low exposure sustained over time.",840dafee-93cd-4c88-8b24-17120006de81
29,methods29," Overall, these findings may appear counterintuitive, as we would have expected, starting from abstainers, a progressive increase in risk with progressive increase in alcohol exposure. Conversely, when looking at Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients consuming an amount of alcohol below the most utilized thresholds associated with development of liver disease, the behaviour did not appear progressive but rather diverging: the group of patients with a greater intake showed the expected detrimental consequences of alcohol, whereas patients with very low alcohol intake showed better outcomes than abstainers, which is rather an innovative finding for liver diseases.",0d041cbf-7814-4ecf-ba06-1dae87bafff3
30,methods30," Our cohort did not allow relevant statistical evaluations on specific effects of different kinds of alcoholic beverages or drinking patterns being composed by prevalently regularly wine-drinkers patients (wine drinking reported by 82% of our patients, in an exclusive fashion in roughly one third of subjects, and with a non-binge pattern of consumption in more than 80% of cases).  Indeed, though still debated, many previous studies have suggested a positive role of low amount of alcohol, especially wine, on Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [13,14,22,23,24], through beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity, plasma adiponectin and systemic inflammation [10,25,26,27], but a potential protective effect on hepatocellular carcinoma was never convincingly demonstrated.",e526dde6-b6ea-4669-9ffa-0d3983d6792b
31,methods31," Studies reporting a detrimental effect of alcohol use on hepatocellular carcinoma in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients are highly heterogeneous, as some focused on patients with an already advanced liver disease [7] and others considered altogether patients inside Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) criteria without differentiation between low and moderate alcohol consume [9,28]. A recent review of six longitudinal observational cohort studies concluded that any level of alcohol intake in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be harmful to liver health, but the studies are highly heterogeneous in definition of quantitative and qualitative alcohol exposure, lifetime consumption was not extensively evaluated, and no separate analysis was conducted on very low alcohol exposure [29].",c380192f-60f6-44ba-8ad3-8295398bdea4
32,methods32," At variance, a very low alcohol consumption (less than two times per week and/or <10 g ethanol per day, preferably wine) was associated with a lower risk of advanced liver disease including hepatocellular carcinoma in sub-analysis of prospective studies on large Finnish and Korean populations [8,21].  Hepatocellular carcinoma can develop in patients with fatty liver even in pre-cirrhotic stage [30], being the strongest modifiable risk factors represented by diabetes, arterial hypertension [31,32] and cigarette smoking [33]. The beneficial effect on insulin-resistance, the pivotal feature of metabolic syndrome, and as a direct consequence on the development of diabetes, may constitute the key point of the protective effect of very low amount of alcohol on hepatocarcinogenesis, at variance with data on cancers of different origin, especially breast, that are associated with any alcohol consumption [11,21].",18449f14-0e1c-4e45-83f2-fb7e07d40fab
33,methods33," This effect may be more evident in our cohort of Mediterranean patients, more overweight than obese (median BMI 29.0) and preferable wine consumers substantially stable over time. Wine consumption has been widely associated with a healthier, Mediterranean diet, rich of vegetables, and a more active lifestyle [34]. In addition, non-alcoholic constituents of wine, as quercetin and resveratrol, have been shown to reduce oxidative damage and inhibit activation of hepatic stellate cells both in in vitro and in vivo experimental settings [35,36,37]. We can speculate that these characteristics of light wine-drinkers may contribute to a more favourable microbiota profile leading to a lower grade of intestinal end systemic inflammation that is known to be associated to disease progression and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients [38,39].",d7e83c5c-b0d1-4498-9c95-c04e1b8344c2
34,methods34,"  Limitations of the present study are the relatively small patient population (which allowed however more accurate characterisation of lifestyle habits compared to large anonymous databases), especially of binge and non-wine drinkers, that does not allow to draw reliable conclusions on the effects of specific kind or patterns of alcoholic drinking, and the observational nature which promotes observation of associations but cannot be conclusive on causative effects.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, our data support a slightly more permissive approach to selected regular drinkers of very low amounts of alcohol: in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients without significant fibrosis, an overall healthier lifestyle based on Mediterranean diet including up to one glass of wine daily, may not be harmful and instead may possibly reduce the risk of progression of liver disease, though the mechanism behind this effect remains to be elucidated.",b7f45ad2-dc5c-4cc3-920f-87bfc2255dd5
