0,methods0,"2.1. Study Protocol and Search Strategy  We formulated the search strategy for PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane with the assistance of a medical librarian (Table S1). The strategy included all studies evaluating the role of diet quality and Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer risk, published up to February 2020, with no language restrictions. In addition, the reference lists of included studies were searched to find related studies. Two investigators (SM and KWJS) completed these steps independently and resolved discrepancies with a third investigator (BZA). The review process was based on the PRISMA-P guidelines [17].  2.2. Eligibility Criteria, Data Extraction We included studies measuring diet quality with a diet index as part of their a priori design.",07732f79-ec8f-4675-8724-2c6e9dc12a7a
1,methods1," In these, Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer cases were required to be identified by the presence of one or more of following: self-report questionnaire or pathology records reviewed by a trained physician, linkage to a cancer registry system, or linkage with a mortality records system.  SM and KWJS extracted the following information: study design, first author, publication year, study country, applied diet index, number of included food components, gender, and age (mean or range). The total population size and incident cases were recorded for cohort studies, and the number of cases and controls were recorded for case-control studies. They also recorded the number of adjusting variables, the outcomes, and the most adjusted risk estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the highest and lowest diet index categories.  2.3.",077a0ca8-e1e9-4508-8431-e0fa0a0bafac
2,methods2," Study Quality Assessment Finally, study quality of eligible studies was appraised by the Newcastle–Ottawa quality assessment scale, according to three parameters: selection, comparability, and exposure for cohort and case-control studies as the following [18].  As for cohort studies, the following items were evaluated as (i.) Selection. The representativeness of the exposed and unexposed populations, and the adequacy of outcome demonstration; (ii.) comparability. Control for age, gender, and at least three additional risk factors, including body mass index, ethnicity, family history of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, dietary supplement intake, helicobacter pylori, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)); (iii.) Exposure/outcome. The methods used for outcome assessment, the adequacy of outcome follow-up (i.e., >10 yrs.",5e5a3dff-69e0-4f0f-981d-d99ccafd9d3f
3,methods3," for Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers), and the details of any loss to follow-up; for case-control studies, the selection and exposure parameters were modified, as follows (i.) selection. The adequacy and representativeness of the case definition, the control selection (e.g., community or hospital), and the confirmation of no history of GI cancer among controls; (ii.) exposure. Whether the same methods were applied to cases and controls for exposure assessment (e.g., secured records, validated questionnaires, or self-report assisted by a healthcare practitioner).   Eventually, study quality was ranked as low (≤3 stars), moderate (4–6 stars), or high (≥7 stars). The maximum scores allocated for study quality were nine stars for a cohort study and eight stars for a case-control study. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and mutual agreement.  2.4.",fd92c737-b92a-46f2-b155-59e77c89ac6b
4,methods4," Data Analysis When there were less than three studies for a certain diet quality measurement, studies were not pooled, as in this situation, the grading of the quality of overall findings is limited. Therefore, in a quantitative meta-analysis, diet quality indices, which were investigated in three or more studies, were included. Hence, we included Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in the analyses. For the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII), we used the most adjusted risk estimates for the lowest compared to the highest category [19], while the reverse was used for the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). By the next step, we considered hazard ratios to be relative risks (RRs), and in turn, converted these to odds ratios (ORs), using the following formula [20]: RR = {OR/((1 − P0) + (P0 × OR))}  where, P0 is the mean incidence rate of gastric/esophageal cancer in the general population within years of the corresponding study was conducted [21].",5f44dec4-7380-41ff-9a97-df8e8b787316
5,methods5," The standard error (SE) was then calculated with the following equation: SElog (RR) = {(SElog (OR) × log(RR))/log(OR)}   The natural logarithms of the ORs, together with their SEs and corresponding CIs, were calculated later. Publication bias was assessed by visual evaluation of funnel plots and Egger’s regression tests for funnel plot asymmetry. To handle the publication bias, we applied the trim and fill methods, as proposed by Duval and Tweedie [22]. In this way, effect sizes for missing studies were estimated, and after adding these effects sizes, the pooled effect size was recalculated. The Cochran’s Q statistic, I2 Index, and P of heterogeneity (Phet) assessed homogeneity. We used random-effects models unless the I2 was ≤25% (indicating low heterogeneity), in which case we applied fixed-effects models. The pooled results for the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were determined by the inverse variance method.",7f54374d-1949-483c-a2f4-97a2f59f1589
6,methods6," For the sensitivity analysis, we assessed the consistency in the pooled results by excluding one study at a time and recalculating the pooled effect at each step. We also conducted stratified analyses to check the consistency of the findings within strata and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity by geographical region (Asia, Europe, and North America), gender (male and female), and tumor site (gastric and esophageal). Analyses were conducted using Review Manager, Version 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 2.2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).",8197fc34-1978-4bfb-8dd8-57380fbd6afb
7,methods7,"  To evaluate whether the existing evidence is of sufficient quality in developing evidence-based dietary recommendations for the prevention of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers, we evaluated the quality of the pooled results on the risk of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer for both the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE)) approach [23]. The probable limitations, including risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and any other considerations, were defined according to these guidelines [23]. We applied the following scores: 0 = not serious, once all components met the criteria; −1 = serious when 1–2 components did not meet the criteria; and −2 = very serious, when >2 components did not meet the criteria.",601527ae-f6e7-4539-a665-1ad301ddb93e
8,methods8," We later upgraded the quality of the overall findings for a large effect size, as follows: 0 = not present; +1 = the pooled effect size showed a decrease of ≤2 in the risk of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer, and +2 = the pooled effect size demonstrated a >2 times lower risk of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer.  We obtained the required information on cancer incidence rates for the country of corresponding studies within the follow-up period, using the databases offered by the website of Global Cancer Observatory. This web-based platform presents worldwide cancer statistics to provide information both for cancer research and cancer control. The data on global epidemiological profile of cancers are supplied by several projects of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, including GLOBOCAN, Cancer incidence in five continents, and cancer survival; in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Central America.",cbad20ac-b0bb-49b0-8c30-18c8efe59018
9,methods9," The required information on applied methodology in this systematic review and pooling the findings, and quality assessment of overall findings were obtained from the Cochrane handbook and website [1,20].  3. Results Of the 53 studies retrieved for full-text review, 24 met the selection criteria (Figure 1 and Table 1). Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers were identified by self-reported questionnaire [7,8,10], physician-reviewed pathology records [7,8,10], linkage to cancer registry system [5,6,7,8,10,11], or pathological confirmation [9,12,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. All included cohort studies were rated as high-quality (7–9 points) (Supplementary Material 1).  3.1. Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) Cancer Risk Based on the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) We included two cohort studies [5,8] and seven case-control studies [9,27,28,29,30,31,36] that used the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII).",3e7c6b6e-a75b-4b04-b689-494bea752791
10,methods10," The quantitative analysis included 519,741 subjects from cohort studies (mean follow-up, 14.5 years) and 5776 subjects from case-control studies. Although visual assessment revealed an asymmetry in funnel plot (Figure S1A), no significant publication bias was detected by Eggers regression tests (z = 1.04, p = 0.26).  Low Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) scores did indicate statistically significant protection against Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer, with a pooled OR of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.48–0.72). The heterogeneity remained significant after excluding studies with extreme findings, identified by funnel plot asymmetry [26,27] or recalculating the effect size by trim and fill method (Figure S1A).  The direction of the pooled effects by gender was not consistent with the overall effect (Figure 2), and heterogeneity among the included studies within each strata was significant (Figure S2A).  The pooled results were scored −2 when grading the overall evidence level.",991f8470-3d55-419f-9630-08c3e35590fc
11,methods11," This was because the findings were limited to Europe and Asia (scoring −1) and were inconsistent (scoring −1) (Table 2 and Supplementary Material 2).  3.2. Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) Cancer Risk Based on the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) We included five cohort studies [5,6,7,10,11] and six case-control studies [12,26,32,33,35,37] that used the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). These cohort studies included 1,022,760 subjects (mean follow-up = 13.32 years) and the case-control studies included 10,447 subjects. Again, there was an asymmetry in the funnel plot, and significant publication bias was detected by Eggers regression tests (z = −3.74, p = 0.01) (Figure S1B). Findings showed significant heterogeneity (I2 = 69% (χ2 = 31.81, Phet = 0.0004). However, after excluding studies with extreme findings [32,35], the asymmetry in the funnel plot improved, and the observed heterogeneity became non-significant.",45a639c3-cb3f-4f4f-a73a-0b67bbd6c306
12,methods12," Given the observed significant publication bias, we applied the trim and fill method to calculate an unbiased effect size. Similar to the observed overall estimates, high scores in the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) had a significant protective effect on the risk of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer, with a pooled OR (adjusted for trim and fill value) of 0.72 (0.61–0.88). Moreover, the direction of the pooled findings did not change in the sensitivity analyses, which was consistent in all stratified analyses except for geographic region, Figure 2. We detected substantial heterogeneity in the analyses stratified by study type, gender, and tumor site (Figure S2B).  The quality of evidence was given a score of −3 due to the findings being restricted to specific geographic regions, such as Europe (scoring −1), the lack of consistency (scoring −1), and the possibility of publication bias (scoring −1) (Table 2 and Supplementary Material 2).  4.",83cca2ce-d8b4-4b9d-ae5c-01269886b2de
13,methods13," Discussion In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 studies, which included a total of 1,558,724 individuals, we showed that a high-quality diet quantified by the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer. However, the data suffered a few limitations. The overall beneficial effect was not consistent for diet quality measured by the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) when stratified by gender. In addition, a high-quality diet measured by the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was significantly and consistently associated with a lower risk of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer when stratified by gender and tumor site. The overall quality of the evidence was graded as low regarding the beneficial effect on Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer risk for a high-quality diet measured by dietary indices.  4.1.",262fc212-1935-45dd-8304-5f338c3a768d
14,methods14," The Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) and Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) Cancer Risk The overall beneficial effect of a high-quality diet measured by the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) was consistent with that of a recent meta-analysis pooling the findings of three case-control studies and reporting a 2.11-times reduction in the risk of gastric cancer [13]. By contrast, Boden et al. reported that diet quality measured by the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) had no impact on Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer risk in a cohort study [5]. This discrepancy could be due to several factors, including that 15 food components with anti-inflammatory effects were missing in the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) calculation, that confounders specific to Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer were not adjusted for (e.g., Helicobacter pylori and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)), and that there was reduced power in the study by Boden et al. [5], (e.g., few incident cases).",dc230999-4ca5-4e29-abb5-9360c43cafa7
15,methods15,"  In our current meta-analysis, two studies presented extreme findings compared with the pooled results [28,29]. The latter might have resulted from the lower quality of the hospital-based case-control design, the limited number of cases, and the lack of data on at least 14 food components for Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) calculation [28,29]. The recent meta-analysis by Du et al. in 2019 found consistent findings with our overall findings [16]. However, the previous meta-analysis focused solely on gastric cancer and diet indices based only three included studies. They found a beneficiary effect for high diet quality in the prevention of gastric cancer [16]. The present study, however, included a broader range of studies of upper GI cancers in the esophagus, and stomach. We included one additional study, which was carried out on gastric cancer, and five additional studies on other Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers.",a14a1a72-3a12-4d4d-a2cb-edeb45d884b6
16,methods16," Accordingly, the consistency observed in the earlier meta-analysis was not confirmed.  Based on the results of this meta-analysis, gender may be considered a key factor contributing to high overall levels of inconsistency. However, other factors also appeared to contribute to inconsistencies in pooled results. These included substantial inter-tumor heterogeneity in Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers and adjustment for different covariates, as well as variability in the dietary component of the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII), the categories applied for analysis with the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII), and the methods used to validate the food frequency questionnaires.",afa7b205-f556-4191-bca5-6d7c364dcdd5
17,methods17," The low quality of the overall findings, mainly due to the observed inconsistency and indirectness (limited studies from Asia and no evidence for North America), reduced our confidence in the observed benefit of a low Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) score being associated with reduced Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer risk. Similarly, the diversity in the scoring system based on the inflammatory response of food components (ranging from 18 to 45 food components) and the low transparency hamper the ability to generate dietary recommendations for preventing Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers based on the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) scoring system. Thus, further research is required using a consistent scoring system for the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII), especially in the less-well represented areas, if we are to draw robust conclusions about applying the related evidence to generate dietary guidelines for the prevention of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer.  4.2.",26c183d1-08f1-450c-b429-d00ded263fc2
18,methods18," The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) Cancer Risk The benefit of an Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)-based high-quality diet for preventing Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer agreed with the conclusions of a recent meta-analysis that included four of the eleven studies in our meta-analysis. Despite the overall beneficial findings in the present analysis, however, we found no beneficial effect in the four included studies [5,6,7,12]. This may have been due to the diversity in Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer subgroups, with these studies including all Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers [5], only gastric cancer [6,7], only esophageal cancer [6], or only and nasopharyngeal cancer [12]. Inter-tumor heterogeneity, failure to adjust for confounders specific to Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer (e.g.",8740bfbe-d2c1-4223-a4c0-88657857361c
19,methods19,", Helicobacter pylori [6,7] and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [6]), the limited number of incident cases [5], and the use of a single dietary assessment [6,12] may also have contributed. Interestingly, although the findings from two other studies [32,35] were similar to those of the pooled results, they showed inconsistency and publication bias. These may have arisen due to limitations inherited from the included case-control studies, as well as being hospital-based [32,35], only including cases and controls from one hospital [32], and only matching cases and controls by age [32].  The inconsistency in the findings by geographic region confirms that study region can explain much of the overall discrepancy in the results. In the current meta-analysis, our findings were mostly restricted to Europe, necessitating investigation in other geographic areas to confirm or refute whether the geographic region is responsible for the observed inconstancies.",58183c5f-f47b-40cf-8fd5-05b701f4b7d2
20,methods20," Our data do, however, support excluding gender and tumor type as causes of heterogeneity, based on the observation that benefits persisted in these strata. Thus, factors such as inter-tumoral heterogeneity and differences in the covariates adjusted for in the included studies may remain potential sources of heterogeneity. Accordingly, research must confirm the generalizability of high adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) for preventing Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer.  The low overall quality of our findings, mainly due to inconsistency and a lack of data for North America and Asia, precludes developing global dietary recommendations for the prevention of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer. Nonetheless, the high consistency in the findings of prospective research highlights the high quality of the evidence for general dietary recommendations to prevent Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer.",cfa3618d-c785-48e6-a8bf-f668df3adcc5
21,methods21," Overall, prospective investigations with broader scope are warranted to compensate for the limited evidence from underrepresented regions. In turn, it is anticipated that this will aid the development of global dietary guidelines for the prevention of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer.  4.3. Other Diet Quality Indices and Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) Cancers Findings from investigations quantifying diet quality based on Chinese Healthy Food Patterns [38], Dietary Guidelines for Americans Adherence Index [24], Diet Quality Index [12], Food Diet Score [39]; Index of Nutritional Quality [40] and empirically defined food indices [32] have demonstrated the beneficiary role of high diet quality in the prevention of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers. Pooling the findings from two studies assessing diet quality based on Healthy Eating Index (HEI) [6,12] revealed the preventive effect of high diet quality on Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers.",2c9e478e-6ba8-43a0-b3cb-ca1a958416fc
22,methods22," However, the two studies showed a high degree of heterogeneity. Variation in applied diet quality indices, applied solely by one or two investigations, halted pooling the effect, and assessing the quality of pooled findings were not feasible.  4.4. Study Strengths and Limitations This research benefitted from an extensive assessment of the role of diet quality, measured by commonly applied dietary indices, on the risk for Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer. Specifically, we applied robust grading of the overall quality of our findings. We provided a comprehensive overview of the repercussion of existing evidence for developing dietary recommendations to prevent Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer. Nevertheless, the pooled findings were inevitably affected by the limitations inherited from the included observational studies, despite rating overall quality. In these observational studies, difficulties exist in a person’s habitual diet assessment.",f9705fa8-b428-43b9-a043-57b5f4cf4548
23,methods23," First, dietary assessment is dependent on the memory of the study subjects. Second, dietary assessments are prone to possible recall biases in unconscious over-reporting of a healthy diet and under-reporting of an unhealthy diet and fluctuations in diet habits based on changes in the environmental and lifestyle situations. This, in turn, leads to an imbalanced recall among participants.  Furthermore, diet quality assessment has mostly been done by a single dietary intake assessment, while dietary habits change over time. Accordingly, while multiple dietary assessments over time would represent more precise actual dietary habits, a single dietary assessment may fail to provide a real reflection of dietary habits. Among other limitations of this study is the substantial heterogeneity in pooled results for the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), necessitating that we conduct extensive stratified analyses of the main confounding factors (i.e.",da35103e-caaf-44e0-917a-5595f6317a27
24,methods24,", study design, geographic region, gender, and tumor size). Another shortcoming is that the findings were mostly restricted to a specific geographic region; consequently, the results cannot be generalized. The overall quality of the findings for both indices was, therefore, downgraded.  5. Conclusions Although our findings suggest a possibility to offer evidence-based general dietary advice for the prevention of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer, the evidence is currently of insufficient quality to develop dietary recommendations. Developing a dietary recommendation for Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) prevention will provide a unified approach that could be clinically applied to improve the diet quality of people at higher risk of Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers, leading to better prevention, and can also be used as a mandate to improve the quality of diet in patients already diagnosed with Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers which, in turn, may lead to a better prognosis.
