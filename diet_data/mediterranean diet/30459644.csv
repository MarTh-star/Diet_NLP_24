0,introduction0,"The World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) makes it plain: “Neurological and mental disorders are the greatest threat to public health”, and it projects that they will be responsible for over half of the world-wide economic impact of disability by 2050. Unless we develop interventions to minimize the impact of emotional distress, learning disabilities, cognitive decline, brain and mental illnesses, society will face an unsurmountable crisis. Therefore, sustaining brain health and reducing the impact of neurological and psychiatric diseases is arguably the greatest challenge of biomedical research for the 21st century. Indeed a systematic review of the literature reveals that if one were to identify a cohort of healthy individuals between 40 and 65 years of age, over the course of a decade, 26% would become diagnosed with neurological or psychiatric diseases [1](see Fig 1).  10.1371/journal.pone.0228754.",8d15d2bd-2d7f-47f9-a77a-236fc80af0f8

Among the younger group, particularly women might be expected to be diagnosed with depression [11,12], while among the older group, mild cognitive impairment and dementia would be predicted to be the most common diagnoses [2,4,6].  A growing number of studies have investigated the mechanisms contributing to the preservation of brain structure and function, cognitive performance, and mental wellbeing, as well as the role of compensation in the face of injury or disease [13,14]. There is increasing evidence that some dietary patterns, leisure activity, cognitive stimulating activity, physical activity, as well as other social and psychological activities can promote brain health maintenance and are associated, for example, with lower risk of dementia (see [15] for a systematic review).",fcaf9aca-c64b-4341-b07c-04c8324c817d
2,introduction2," Livingstone and collaborators suggested that even beyond the biological or genetic predisposition (e.g. Apoe4 allele), dementia could be prevented in up to 35% of the cases through improved control of medical conditions such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, and attention to modifiable risk factors such as education, smoking, physical activity and socialization. Recent interventional studies support this view and suggest that multi-domain lifestyles interventions may improve mental and cognitive functioning, and be particularly effective in people at risk [16]. Thus, modifiable and non-modifiable factors may interact and ultimately either increase or decrease an individual’s risk to develop dementia and other neurological or psychiatric conditions [15, 17–19].",7335c3e9-8b7b-4491-9df6-525bd335220b
3,introduction3,"  The Barcelona Brain Health Initiative (Barcelona Brain Health Initiative (BBHI)) is a longitudinal cohort study started in 2017 with the aim to understand and characterize biological, behavioral and environmental markers, and their interactions, related with brain health maintenance in middle to old age [1]. In the first phase of the study, participants completed questionnaires that collected information about socio-demographic, socio-economic, and lifestyles relevant to brain health. We hypothesized that participation in the study might increase awareness of the importance of healthy lifestyles, improving adherence. Here we 1) report baseline characteristics of the cohort and analyze the changes on lifestyles measures after one year of participation in the study, and 2) identify participants who developed new neurological and psychiatric diagnoses and identify risk factors that contributed to them.",50b90fd8-dc7c-4356-b404-25756f49ab4b

Participants were recruited by an intensive dissemination and communication campaign made through different media (TV, radio, newspapers) as well as the most common social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). The engagement of well-known opinion leaders from the sports, journalism or acting world, who recorded short videos describing the study and thus served as ambassadors for the initiative, helped increase the visibility and contributed to the recruitment.  People interested in the study enrolled online through the website of the project (https://bbhi.cat) by filling out an initial contact form.",d75b4b2f-c2c2-476c-ac66-f5d33477ebe1

Third, we assessed possible changes between baseline and follow-up using paired t tests.  Next, to explore whether baseline characteristics were predictive of changes over time for each of our variables of interest we regressed its change over time (one-year follow up score—baseline score) on its baseline score. To correct for “regression to the mean”, due to intrinsic noisy nature of the data collecting instruments, we re-ran linear regressions using the changes (subtraction between follow-up and baseline) as dependent variables and the mean between first and second questionnaires’ scores as predictors (after after checking for variance homogeneity; [45,46].",41f339ef-bccd-419d-a10c-1d6894caf199

Of these, sleep appears to mediate the relationship between non-modifiable factors, such as gender, and new diagnoses of depression.  Baseline characteristics of the cohort Participants were not representative of the general population for socio-demographic factors and lifestyles, probably due to the study methodology (on-line recruitment).

This medium to high adherence to some health related lifestyles of our participants reflect the general tendency culturally related of Catalan/Spanish population. For this reason Barcelona was an ideal location to study the effect of good lifestyle habits on the maintenance of brain health given a lot of the lifestyle pillars we study are inherent in the culture (diet, exercise, socialization for example).

Retention challenges Retention at the one-year follow-up is clearly a limitation of the study, and is an important issue to explore. About 50% of the participants who enrolled failed to complete the one-year follow-up survey. Such an attrition rate is not far from previous on-line longitudinal studies [53], but higher than longitudinal studies that applied specific retention strategies trying to limit drop-outs [54, 55]. Cohorts characteristics seem to be a crucial factor in modulate retention rates, particularly depending by different study modalities employed.

These and results from other studies have to be taken into account for this and future on-line cohort studies to implement focused and specific retention strategies to limit drop-outs.  “One-year follow-up responders” were older, with higher educational level, and reported at the beginning better self-perceived cognitive and mental health, as well as more physical activity and vital plan. This is in line with what has been found in previous longitudinal studies that showed that low educational level, psychological distress and unhealthy life style factors, like physical inactivity, are associated to attrition [57, 58, 59]. This suggests that people with more interest in health maintenance and healthy lifestyles are those who tend to be more engaged in such studies, probably unavoidably introducing the observed population bias recruiting and bias follow-up in such studies.",f522725d-84f2-4936-bdb0-1e04cf111e62

However, these differences, even if statistically significant, were rather small in effect size. We hypothesize that those participants who already have healthy habits did not change them, considering especially that participants that completed the one-year follow-up showed better lifestyles at baseline. In order to test this we explored the relation between the one year change, as the difference between scores at one-year and at baseline, and the baseline characteristic of participants.

32,discussion7," We explored the possibility that these results might have been driven by test-retest variability and a regression to the mean phenomenon [45, 60], rather than from real changes in participant’s habits. However, even after correcting for this [46] we still found a negative association between habits at the beginning of the study and improvement over a year, even though is clearly reduced in the magnitude.  These negative associations between habits at baseline and follow-up may be related to difficulties in maintaining good habits consistently over-time. This interpretation may have relevance for the implementation of multi-domain interventions aiming for simultaneous optimization of multiple lifestyles. Few studies to date have succeeded in such efforts and the present results may be important to consider in the setting of study design.",e95885e4-1d39-4e74-a29f-e387dcd491f9
33,discussion8," However this interpretation should be taken with caution since as stated previously, the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative (BBHI) participants have continued access to ‘brain tips’ and ‘brain news’ through both the public and personalized dedicated web portals of the project. Therefore and beyond the fact that negative associations between baseline and follow up habit status may be explained by a ‘regression to the mean’ phenomena, we cannot determine if habits change from baseline to follow-up could rather reflect a ‘natural course’ or the effect of a ‘low level of intervention’, because a control group (i.e. participants assessed both at baseline and at follow up but not participating in the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative (BBHI)) was not included in our study.  Endpoints analysis The one year follow-up survey revealed that 73 participants had been diagnosed in the last year with one of the neurological or neuropsychiatric condition that represents an endpoint for the study.",2513b93a-6ae1-42c2-bd83-b77832cd5fa8
34,discussion9," This represents slightly over 3% incidence of new diagnoses for the cohort of previously healthy 40–65 year olds, which is in line with the statistical estimation that we made based on Spanish available epidemiological data for these diseases (Fig 1, [1–10]). Moreover, in line with recent epidemiological reviews [61] and considering the age-range and the high proportion of women in the cohort, the most incident condition was major depression (76.7% of all reported new diagnoses; [1–10].  We explored the relation between lifestyles and participants characteristics and the incidence of a new diagnosis of depression. First, we looked at the association between habit changes over the year and diagnosis and we found that increased purpose in life represented a protective factor.",e2f3cf1c-9801-4e05-a5b0-7c7ab3cef042
35,discussion10,"  Purpose in life is a psychological construct that represent the notion of having a sense of goal and future oriented behavior that may confer more capacity to manage and tolerate changes and demanding temporal situations. Purpose in life is one of the six components of Carol D. Ryff’s prevalent model [62], along with autonomy, personal growth, environmental mastery, positive relationships, and self-acceptance. It has been previously related with biological risk factors such as inflammatory markers [63], cardiovascular diseases [64], and other health related outcomes [65]. Purpose in life has been also related with cognitive function in healthy adults, mortality, and to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; [66, 67, 68, 69]).  Second we explored if certain baseline modifiable and non-modifiable condition may represent a risk or protective factor.",4e8b36ae-aa12-4a6e-829e-14256c236008
36,discussion11," Results revealed that women were at higher risk for diagnosis of depression (see Table 6), while higher levels of sleep quality and Sense of coherence represent protective factors to develop this condition. Considering that almost 80% of the diagnosis was depression these results are not surprising. There is consistent evidence in literature suggesting that women are twice as likely to develop depression that man [11, 12], and also sense of coherence and sleep have been previously associated with depression [70, 71]. The role of gender as a risk factor for depression has been related to the more stressful role of women in society and the resulting lower degrees of fulfillment, and the greater vulnerability to negative life events of friends and family given the increase sense of responsibility, copying style and biological response to stress [12, 72].",870f6e37-e767-4f68-a8dd-162a81629ada
37,discussion12,"  Sense of Coherence, is not a cultured-bound construct that allows individuals to identify strategies and resources available to manage stressors, and it has been related to a variety of health outcomes, including depression ([71, 73]; see [74] for a review). Sense of coherence is a core component in the salutogenic model of Aaron Antonovsky [75] and is defined as “a global orientation that expresses the extent to which one has a pervasive, enduring though dynamic feeling of confidence that (1) the stimuli deriving from one’s internal and external environments in the course of living are structured, predictable, and explicable; (2) the resources are available to one to meet the demands posed by these stimuli; and (3) these demands are challenges, worthy of investment and engagement’ [76].",16652995-74a7-4f3d-a58f-f74f1905539d
38,discussion13," Our findings are consistent with studies that argue that a high sense of coherence allows to better cope with stressors and represents a health promoting factor [71] associated with reduced mortality, increased well-being, and reduced incidence of depression [77, 78, 79].  Finally, the relation between sleep disturbance and mental health is well documented in literature, particularly with insomnia. This condition indeed has been consistently related with depression [80, 81, 82] and a recent meta-analysis showed that it is a very strong predictor of this condition [83]. When we looked at the relation between these modifiable and non-modifiable variables in regards to the risk of a new neurologic or psychiatric diagnosis we found that sleep quality partially mediated the relation between gender and risk of depression.",72e853de-c86a-4165-863d-9d7cc3bf1be2
39,discussion14," The association between gender and specific sleep disorders is known and well documented in literature (see [84] for review): women are more likely than men to develop insomnia, restless leg syndrome and REM sleep disorders, while men are at double the risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea than women. Given such findings, it is not surprising that part of the risk to develop depression is linked to poor sleep quality.  These findings stress the importance of promoting sleep quality in middle age people, particularly in women, and extend to the field of prevention previous results on the positive effect of sleep quality interventions in the treatment of mental health illnesses [85]. Future intervention studies should assess the impact of sleep quality promotion programs in reducing the incidence of mental health related pathology.  Limitation and future directions This study has some possible limitation/confounders.",f60303b4-c8ff-42c1-9bd7-b723671767f8
40,discussion15," The on-line administration of the questionnaires, as well as representativeness of the cohort and statistical bias may limit the strong of our results.  Moreover 93.7% of participants are living in the metropolitan area of Barcelona and are born in Spain (and more than 99% in Europe), and represent a rather homogeneous Caucasian population. The fact that our participants may reflect culturally related of Catalan/Spanish population is a possible limitation in extend our results to other populations. Further studies in other cultural contexts and other regions of the world would be needed to address this issue.  On the other hand the big number of participants represents a positive factor and in this sense the retention challenge mentioned above represents a very crucial point for the future of the initiative. During this year participants will continue to respond periodically to new surveys and for the end of 2019 they will complete a new 1-year follow up for.",81a84596-eda7-454b-8a77-f686c92c1f2d
