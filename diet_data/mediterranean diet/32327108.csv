0,methods0," 2.1. Study Ethics and Recruitment  Data for the present analysis were collected and analyzed under the frame of the MeDiWeB (Mediterranean Diet and Wellbeing) consortium constituted by several research institutions from 7 countries in the Southern European region. The project was designed to assess and compare the food habits and MD adherence across various Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries, as well as their relationship with an array of lifestyle and behavioral characteristics related to subjective well-being (subjective well being (SWB)) [14,22]. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of each partner research institution and complies with European Regulation on Data Protection [33].",0fe725b4-ffd1-4e1d-9c24-4d84ff089070
1,methods1," A structured questionnaire was prepared in the official language of each country and constructed in Google Forms, being disseminated through institutional mailing lists, social media, personal contacts, and word-of-mouth communication for the collection of data. The questionnaire was confidential and filled anonymously online. Data were collected between April 2019 and mid-March 2020 (before the COVID-19 lockdown).  The initial data comprised an overall sample of 3350 adults of both sexes recruited in 5 Mediterranean countries (MED) countries, namely, SP, PT, GR, CY, IT, and 2 Balkan countries, North Macedonia (NMK) and BG (non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries). Participants were eliminated from the study due to (i) lack of consent, (ii) age <18 y, (iii) duplicates, and/or (iv) participants whose nationality differed from the country in which they were living in.",0d72193e-ae5d-4b96-a653-af9828862afb
2,methods2," A total of 3145 adults (age ≥ 18 years) distributed across the different countries were finally included in the study. Inadequate responses (lack of food item information) were additionally eliminated for the analyses of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score (Figure S1).  2.2. MeDiWeB Questionnaire  The MeDiWeB questionnaire was designed according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (operation and Development (OECD)) recommendations [34] and has been already fully described and published [22]. In brief, the questionnaire includes items on sociodemographic data, subjective well being (SWB), health status, lifestyle, and dietary choices.",7765d842-3d33-4e86-965a-5aa2a800334e
3,methods3," In the current study, we report the results of the analyses of the following subset of variables for each of the participant countries and for the Mediterranean countries (MED) group and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) groups: sociodemographic data (age, sex), health-related information (self-reported diagnosed pathology, weight (kg), and height (m), used to calculate body mass index (BMI, kg/m2)), and food choices. Participants were also classified into (1) age groups (early (18–24 y), middle (25–44 y), and late (45–64 y) adults and senior (≥65 y)), (2) BMI categories (underweight (<18.5kg/m2), normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2), and obesity (≥30 kg/m2)) as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) [35], and (3) disease status (no declared pathology, 1 pathology, multi-pathology). The nature of the pathologies was classified using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems [36].",b22ef0f5-f409-4197-b182-c64fe6478b8e
4,methods4,"  The food questions included the 14 items that constitute the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) screener adapted from PREDIMediterranean countries (MED) and that was used to calculate the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score as previously described [14]. The results were ranked to estimate the adherence to the MD as follows: weak adherence, ≤5; moderate adherence, 6–9; good adherence ≥10 [37]. The MeDiWeB survey also included several questions about daily consumption of milk and derived products; preference for low-fat dairy products and whole cereals; daily intake of water, caffeinated drinks, and herbal teas; and the total number of meals per day.  2.3. Statistical Analyses  The normality of the continuous variables in the different population samples was assessed by graphical inspection (frequency histograms and Q-Q plots), as well as by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk tests.",d3d1933f-4f68-43e0-be3b-6a09ea4a4af6
5,methods5," In most cases, the variables were significantly deviated from a normal distribution and thus we herein report the results of comparative non-parametric tests. Absolute frequencies and percentages were used to represent ordinal or nominal variables (sex, age range, BMI range, disease status, food choices), whereas the scale variables (age, BMI, 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score) were presented as the median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)). The mean and SD were also included to simplify comparison with previously published data.  The Mann–Whitney test (M-W) was used to assess the differences in the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score between sexes, whereas the Kruskal–Wallis (K-W) test was applied for comparisons across age ranges, BMI categories, and disease status subgroups.",a1341c8d-92b8-4eb4-8021-6bf6a8fd46f5
6,methods6," Chi-squared tests (Chi-S) were used to assess the statistical association between nominal and ordinal variables. Partial correlation between continuous variables was calculated using the Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) adjusted in each case for the corresponding confounding variables (sex, age, BMI, disease). The general linear model was used to compare the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score through countries while controlling for the effects of sex, age, BMI, and disease. We additionally quantified the effect size by means of the standardized mean difference [38]. The results were interpreted following Cohen’s guidelines (0.2 small, 0.5 medium, and 0.8 large, in absolute value [39]). Fisher’s exact test was applied to assess whether the differences between the frequency of observations were significant between the Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) group of countries.",4f38e553-f70f-47b1-9ffd-012552a5a26e
7,methods7," The strength of the association between these 2 groups was additionally estimated by the Phi and Cramer’s V association coefficients (following Cohen’s guidelines, values were classified as 0.1 small, 0.3 medium, 0.5 large, in absolute value [39]). All statistical tests were based on two-sided tests (bilateral significance) and had a significance level of 5% (α = 0.05). All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 26.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).  3. Results  3.1. Characteristics of the Participants  The characteristics of the sample population in each country and in the Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) entire groups are shown in Table 1. Overall, this population was constituted by a higher proportion of female than male participants (ratio ≈7:3).",75c09160-187e-434d-b19b-76d3831929bd
8,methods8," There was a slightly higher percentage of women in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries than in the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries (71.4% vs. 67.2%, p-value < 0.02). Within the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries, the highest proportion of women was found in GR (77.7%), followed by CY and PT (72%), IT (62.4%), and SP (56.8%). In the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) participants, differences in the percentage of women between BG (69.1%) and North Macedonia (NMK) (74.1%) did not reach statistical significance.  The participants had an average age of ≈38 y, with the bulk of the sample population (93%) classified as middle and late adults (25 to 64 y), and only a small percentage (≈3%) were senior participants (≥65 y). Comparative mean age analyses across countries showed small but significant differences (p-value < 0.001), with SP and BG having the oldest population samples (45.7 ± 12.8 y and 43.0 ± 12.",4472b846-60b8-46fc-ba7d-a703fb4d4cbb
9,methods9,"8 y, respectively), while the participants from GR and North Macedonia (NMK) were the youngest (34.8 ± 8.9 y and 29.2 ± 10.5 y, respectively). We did not detect significant differences for BMI between Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries, with a common average value of 24.6 kg/m2 and the highest proportion of participants classified in the normal weight category (58.4% and 56.7%, for the Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) groups, respectively). In all the countries, the sample population was constituted by more than 30% of overweight and obesity participants and less than 5% of underweight participants. At the country level, we found some small but significant differences with the highest BMI mean values and the highest percentage of overweight and obesity participants in GR, BG, and SP (47.4%, 42.9%, and 40.8%, respectively), while North Macedonia (NMK) showed the lowest rate (32.9%).",e16e9ecd-bf19-4ee8-ba42-7848c52ea40b
10,methods10,"  The participants were asked to indicate whether they had any diagnosed pathology and, if so, to describe which type of disease it was. The distribution of the responses is also included in Table 1. Regardless of the nationality, most of the participants (65–85%) were considered healthy since they did not report any pathology, and only a very small proportion of individuals (<8%) declared having more than one pathology. We found some significant differences (p-value < 0.001) between the Mediterranean countries (MED) and the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) groups, with ≈10% more participants in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries that did not report any pathology as compared to the Mediterranean countries (MED) ones. Across the individual countries, SP exhibited the largest proportion of participants with one or more pathologies, while North Macedonia (NMK), BG, and IT showed the highest rate of healthy individuals.",ae33faeb-4e6f-4443-87fe-c6c243dbafc9
11,methods11," Regarding the nature of the pathologies, a summary with the principal reported diseases is presented in Table S1. The most commonly declared disorders were those related to the endocrine, nutritional, or metabolic diseases (≈20–40%), followed by diseases of the circulatory system (≈15–28%). In a lower proportion (but above 10%), the participants also reported having diseases of the digestive system (IT, PT, and BG), respiratory system (PT and GR), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue system (CY and GR).  3.2.",25570ece-7396-4773-b862-0d9b4d160891
12,methods12," Analysis of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) Score across Countries  The 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) scores, their distribution into the three main categories of MD adherence, and the comparative analyses between sexes, age ranges, BMI categories, disease status, and across countries are included in Table S2a (Mediterranean countries (MED) countries) and Table S2b (non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries). Results are also presented and summarized in Figure 1. Within the Mediterranean countries (MED) group, 68.3% of the participants were classified into the moderate category of MD adherence, with median score values between 6.0 and 8.0 in all the subgroups analyzed. On average, only 11.0% of the Mediterranean countries (MED) participants were classified into the high MD adherence group (score ≥ 10.0).",d327b7e8-ff21-41d4-b0ac-8f42d64022ff
13,methods13," The participants of the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) group exhibited slightly lower scores than the Mediterranean countries (MED) group, with median values between 6.0 (moderate) and 5.0 (low) and with the highest proportion (51.3%) classified into the low category of MD adherence. Differences between the Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) sample populations reached high statistical significance (p-values < 0.001 or <0.01) in all the subgroups analyzed. Differences across the countries were small but significant and can be discerned looking at the mean and SD values. The population from SP exhibited the highest score (7.90 ± 1.72) followed by PT (7.38 ± 2.10), GR (7.13 ± 2.03), and IT (6.80 ± 1.54), whereas the CY population had the lowest value (6.12 ± 1.99) of the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries. BG and North Macedonia (NMK) had significantly lower scores (5.80 ± 1.80 and 5.30 ± 1.80, respectively).",af77f555-bc3e-4f25-9ede-20ed76e16748
14,methods14," The significant differences between countries and ranking order were sustained in most of the subgroups examined.  Regarding the differences between sexes, women exhibited a slightly higher mean score than men in all the countries (standardized mean difference between sexes of ≈0.2, categorized as small in the Cohen scale [39]). Sex differences reached statistical significance in the entire Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) groups as well as in the PT, SP, and BG sample population (Figure 1a). The 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score was generally found to be slightly higher with increasing age (Figure 1b,c; Spearman adjusted correlation coefficients between 0.1 and 0.3, small effect size in the Cohen guideline [39]).",946e8cb4-32a6-46a0-a8bc-c894bd7d16f8
15,methods15," Differences across age ranges were significant both in the whole Mediterranean countries (MED) group and in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) group, as well as for most individual countries (except for BG). In the case of the sample populations from GR and BG, the score increased only until the 45–64 y age range and then it decreased in participants 65 y old or older; however, these results may be affected by the low number of participants in the senior age range. With respect to the classification of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score into the main BMI categories, we detected a minor downwards trend of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score with increasing BMI in only some of the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries (Figure 1d), although the changes were rather small (Spearman adjusted correlation ≈ −0.",5f2dcbea-e278-4937-8184-d07478c80e5a

In the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries, we did not detect a significant trend between the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score and BMI, although the score also decreased with increasing BMI category in the case of the sample population from BG (Figure 1d,e). We were not able to detect significant differences between the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score across the three categories of the disease status (Figure 1f,g).  3.3.",cd316799-8dff-431e-96d4-f95f9a38774a
17,methods17, Comparison across Countries of the 14-Food Items Included in the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) Score  We next analyzed and compared the choices for each of the food items (included in the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score) across all countries as well as between the entire Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) groups. A summary with a comprehensive contrast between the Mediterranean countries (MED) group and the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) group is displayed in Figure 2. Individual results are listed in Table 2 and can also be seen as radar graphs in Figure S2.,feeee559-81cc-48a0-95ea-4df6153d070d
18,methods18,"  Overall, the Mediterranean countries (MED) group had a higher percentage of participants who scored 1 (within Mediterranean diet recommendations) than the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) group for most of the food choices excluding sweet drinks, which was similar in both groups of countries, and wine consumption, which was slightly higher in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) participants, especially in BG.  Nevertheless, most differences between the two groups were categorized as small, except for the preference for OO as the main culinary fat (94.7% in the Mediterranean countries (MED) group vs. 38.0% in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) group; 0.62, large difference based on the Phi and Cramer’s V association coefficients; Table 2).",0cd3f349-9353-4a5c-9248-84223e3dba4b
19,methods19," Within the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries, the best score for OO preference was detected in SP and the lowest in CY, yet the estimation of the quantity of OO consumed in all the countries was well below the Mediterranean countries (MED) diet recommendations (less than 30% of the participants declared to consume ≥4 tbsp/day). With regards to the consumption of fats (butter and cream), more than 65% of the participants in each country declared eating <1 portion per day, with the lowest consumption detected in IT and SP and the highest in BG and PT.  In both the Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries, more than 95% of the participants consumed <1 portion red meat/day. This result was in reasonable agreement with a high preference for white meat (≈70% or higher) in the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries.",e1788ff2-246d-471c-afaa-b4e48fae4805
20,methods20," The preference for white meat was slightly lower (less than 60%) in the participants of the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries. The consumption of fish was very low in all the countries, with PT and SP exhibiting the highest percentage of participants consuming ≥3 portions of fish per week (35.0% and 19.4%, respectively).  The consumption of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts were in general very low, with most countries exhibiting around 50% or less of the participants with intakes within the MD recommendations (Table 2). Values were particularly low for the IT and North Macedonia (NMK) sample populations, wherein the proportion of participants consuming the recommended portions of these four items were 41%, 8.7%, 14.3%, and 10.3%, and 21.3%, 8.1%, 14.5%, and 18.4%, respectively.",66af37ee-194d-4782-b11d-f3fbd6c48151
21,methods21," The consumption of ≥2 meals with “sofrito” per week in the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries was about 60 to 75%, with the exception of CY, where only ≈30% of people were within this recommendation. Desserts achieved percentages above 70% within recommendations for most countries, except for North Macedonia (NMK), where only 58% of the sample population indicated consuming <3 portions/week.  As already stated, there were no significant differences between the average Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) groups with respect to the consumption of sweet drinks and, although there were some small significant differences between the individual countries, they all had more than 65% of participants consuming <1 sweet beverage per day. On the other hand, the proportion of participants in each country consuming the recommended amount of wine (7 to 14 glasses/week) was very low, mostly ≤5%, except for BG, which reached 15% of the sample population (Table 2).",7f958a95-d5e7-410e-a831-165127e79b94
22,methods22,"  We additionally explored the differences in food choices between sexes, age ranges, BMI categories, and disease status (Tables S3–S6). Overall, there were no outstanding differences between the analyzed subgroups, with most results being non-significant (particularly in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) group) or with very small differences between them (<0.2 strength of association or effect size by Phi and Cramer’s V association coefficients). Regarding sex (Table S3), women in general scored higher than men for most food items, but the most noticeable differences were found for white meat preference, which was higher in women than in men both in the Mediterranean countries (MED) and the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) groups. The consumption of vegetables was also significantly higher in women in the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries, whereas in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries, women scored slightly better for the consumption of red meat and sofrito.",85757032-961f-457a-8692-b5a8eacdec42
23,methods23," In general, and within the Mediterranean countries (MED) group of countries, most food choices were slightly improved with age (Table S4), except for the consumption of fish, butter, or cream, as well as the preference for white meat. The improvement with age was less clearly seen in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) group, although we still detected some small improvement in the consumption of desserts, sweet drinks, vegetables, and wine, principally up to the 45–64 y age range. Differences in individual food choices between BMI categories and disease status (Tables S5 and S6, respectively) were mostly not significant or very small, with some food items slightly worsened across categories, whereas some others were improved (i.e., small decrease of the white meat preference with BMI increase in the Mediterranean countries (MED) group or small improvement in the scoring of sweet drinks with BMI in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) group).  3.4.",9b72658c-4ab1-49c6-bce8-b79f735fcbdf
24,methods24," Additional Food-Related Questions Included in the MeDiWeB Questionnaire  We further analyzed and compared the responses to the remaining food questions included in the MeDiWeB survey but not used in the calculation of the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score. The results are presented in Table 3 and in Figure S3 which, in general, show small differences across the countries. Overall, ≥60% of the participants from each country indicated consuming “one or two milk and derived products per day”, but the highest percentages were seen in SP (85.2%), IT (73.5%), and GR (70.2%). There was a significantly higher preference for low-fat dairy products in the Mediterranean countries (MED) group than in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) group (64.2% vs. 35.4%, p-value < 0.001). The preference for whole grain varied across the countries from ≈50% (BG and SP) to nearly 80% (CY).

On the other hand, the percentage of participants consuming one to three cups of herbal teas was ≤35% in most countries, except for BG, which had the highest value (45.3%).  We finally compared the number of meals per day in each country and found that, on average, the participants from the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries had 1 meal more per day than the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries (4.0 ± 1.0 and 3.1 ± 0.9, respectively) (Table 3).  4. Discussion  In recent years, populations living in Southern Europe and around the Mediterranean basin have experienced a general shift from their traditional dietary habits towards more Westernized patterns.",97602b1b-0038-4e8b-8045-e1fb8b781cc8
26,methods26," Efforts to reverse this situation and its associated increased disease risk have been implemented throughout the past years with different strategies, including the promotion of the MD and, in particular, of the healthier and more sustainable plant-based foods [41]. Yet the progress of these efforts had not been simultaneously assessed in a cross-national study using a common method to measure the degree of adherence to the MD. The current investigation compares for the first time the MD adherence and food choices in a large sample of adults from a group of Southern European Mediterranean countries (MED) countries (SP, PT, IT, GR, CY) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries of the Balkan region (BG, North Macedonia (NMK)) applying the same methodology.  Data were collected using a web-based survey that included the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) scoring system previously validated in the same countries [14].",9ff8b8f1-bdd3-4e5f-8be8-19daaac4e022
27,methods27," In that former preliminary validation study (N < 100 participants per country), the estimated 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score was able to discern between the Mediterranean countries (MED) participants with a moderate and higher score than the Balkan participants, which showed a weak adherence. The results from the present study (N ≈ 300–500 participants per country) confirmed the difference between a moderate score for the Mediterranean countries (MED) participants and a lower adherence for BG and North Macedonia (NMK). The sample population from SP was also established to have the highest score in both studies.",c71813ab-c28b-4527-a303-45f41f6e20dc
28,methods28," Even so, the specific MD adherence classification of the participant countries (SP > PT > GR > IT > CY > BG > North Macedonia (NMK)) was slightly altered as compared with that attained in the previous validation study (SP > IT > PT > CY ~ GR > North Macedonia (NMK) > BG) [14], showing that for countries with very little differences between them, a precise ranking of their MD adherence would benefit from the implementation of cross-national studies applying common protocols and scoring systems. Larger sample populations will still be required to further substantiate the small differences across individual countries detected in our study.  Regarding the Mediterranean countries (MED) participant countries, analogous results with scores in the midrange of the scale were previously reported in SP [15,16,28,30,37,42,43], PT [22,44,45], IT [17,18,46,47,48,49], GR [50,51], and CY [52].",954e0c8f-ea65-4676-9aa9-672cf188e56b
29,methods29," Other Southern European as well as some non-European Mediterranean countries (MED) countries [23,27,53] have also been attributed a moderate value of MD adherence. There is, however, limited information regarding MD adherence in countries from the Balkan region. According to the Mediterranean adequacy index (Mediterranean adequacy index (MAI)), countries such as Albania or BG have also experienced, in the past decades, a considerable drift from the Mediterranean dietary habits [54], and a cross-sectional study carried out in Croatia (N = 10,001 participants) reported a Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS)) of ≈45% of the maximum score [55]. The PREDIMediterranean countries (MED) 14-item food frequency questionnaire was only recently applied in a study conducted in Albania (N = 209 participants), showing that the majority of the participants had also a moderate MD adherence [56].",9cf97dfa-f20e-4867-83f5-b752412298e5
30,methods30," Our study is the first to apply the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) scoring system to estimate MD adherence in BG and North Macedonia (NMK), confirming that the participants from these two countries had a moderate-to-low MD adherence. All the above data evidence that, with independence of the scoring system employed, countries in Southern Europe including those classified as typically Mediterranean countries (MED) countries as well as countries of the Balkan region, which traditionally had food patterns with common characteristics with the MD, have all consistently reported to have a dietary pattern substantially different from the traditional MD. This difference is positioned ≈6–7 points below the highest 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score and does not appear to have improved during recent years.",5eb86111-1f70-44f9-940a-8e913348fe75
31,methods31,"  To determine which specific food items were responsible for the observed moderate MD adherence values and the differences between the investigated countries, we analyzed the percentage of participants surpassing the Mediterranean cutoff criteria depicted in the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) scoring system. We found evidence of both positive and negative features in the Mediterranean countries (MED) populations taking part in this study. On the favorable side, and in good agreement with earlier studies also conducted in the general adult population from SP [15,16,28,30,37,42], PT [44,45], IT [17], or GR [19], our results supported a clear preference for OO against butter, with OO displaying more than 90% of subjects within the MD recommendations, and between ≈60% and 95% consuming less than one portion of butter or cream per day. Nonetheless, the target quantity for OO (≥4 tbsp/day) was reached by ≤30% of the participants.",80487db0-fc63-4465-9cf2-095d08ccf26f
32,methods32," Previous results related to the quantity of OO intake [15,16,17,19,26,28,30,37,42,44,50] show, in general, a high variability suggesting some difficulty in the estimation and reporting of the actual daily intake of this product. On the other hand, the consumption of sofrito (prepared with OO) was also reasonably high (>60% of participants within recommendations except for CY) and support a frequent consumption of OO as the main cooking oil in these Mediterranean countries (MED) countries [15,17,19,30,37,42,44]. The results of our survey also pointed towards a reduction of red meat consumption, with more than 95% of the Mediterranean countries (MED) participants indicating achieving the MD recommendations.",cbb6e3bd-3e1c-4155-9b60-f8c9d2162d93
33,methods33," Similar results were previously reported in GR [19], but more variable and generally lower percentages were reported in other studies conducted in SP [15,16,28,37,42], IT [17], and PT [44], suggesting a potential improvement in these countries with regards to the consumption of red meat. In support of this, our results showed a high proportion (≈70–85%) of participants preferring white meat, also in good agreement with some data previously reported in SP [37,42], IT [17], and PT [44]. In addition, our data pointed to a reduced consumption of sugar, with ≈65–80% of participants achieving the recommended targets for the intake of sweet beverages and desserts. These results are similarly supported by previous data in SP [15,16,28,37,43], IT [17], PT [44], and GR [19].",24dfdc82-ab31-40ca-84f9-d0e763fee6f9
34,methods34," With regard to plant-based foods, our analyses indicated a low intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts in the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries, with percentages of participants achieving the targets well below 50%. These results are consistent with those reported in previous studies conducted in SP, IT, PT, and GR [15,16,17,19,28,37,42,44]. Of note, our study also showed a very low percentage (≤5%) of compliance with MD recommendations for wine drinking. These results were even lower than previous reported scores for this item [15,17,28,37,42,44], suggestive of a reduction in wine intake. Fish consumption was also found to be, in general, low (<20–30%), and even lower than previously reported in SP and IT [15,17,28,37,42,44].  Overall, the percentage of participants scoring within the MD recommendations for most food items was lower in the two Balkan countries than in the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries.",336fb9d3-9503-4652-9892-c738138f7f2e
35,methods35," The largest difference was found for OO, with only ≈40% of the Balkan participants preferring this fat source. These results are in reasonable agreement with the latest data for OO supply quantity (kg/person y) as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization [57] in those same countries. On the other hand, a high proportion of the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) participants indicated complying with the recommendations for reduced intake of red meat and of sweet beverages. These results are to some extent in contrast with an earlier subtle but steady raising trend in the consumption of pork and processed meat products [58] and a visible increase of soft drink consumption for BG [59,60]. Our results for the consumption of plant-based foods in BG and North Macedonia (NMK) also indicated a substantial deviation from the MD recommended targets.",dd34e2b9-a095-4ff0-b95d-36054d82c801
36,methods36," Although there is limited published information about food choices in these countries, previous studies had indicated an important need to increase the consumption of dietary fiber in BG and North Macedonia (NMK) [61,62], already suggesting a low consumption of plant-based foods. A significant drop of plant food intake in BG, especially of fresh fruit, was seen during the post-communist years [63], although some more recent research has shown that about 50% percent of university students habitually consumed fruits and vegetables [64], suggesting a certain improvement in younger generations. Conversely, another study conducted in adolescents from North Macedonia (NMK) has shown that less than 20% of them were consumers of the recommended daily servings of fruit and vegetables [65].",2afbbab5-374b-434a-bdfd-20e59152fa38
37,methods37," The MD recommendations for nuts, legumes, and fish were also reached by a very low percentage of participants in BG and North Macedonia (NMK), which may be partially attributed to the high prices of some of those products as well as a lack of tradition, for example, of fish eating [66]. On the other hand, the results of the consumption of wine in BG exhibited the best response as compared with the rest of investigated countries, with 15% of respondents achieving the 7 to 14 glasses per week. This higher value may be, however, associated with customary uses taking place during the wintertime in this country [67]. Recently, and more in agreement with a low percentage of participants achieving wine drinking targets, wine consumption in BG was reported to have declined [68].",d4eee644-857b-4960-b15c-a2f7667bc4e9
38,methods38,"  Taking into account all the evidence reported here, we were able to infer that in the general adult population from the Southern European countries examined, there appears to be a consistent and persistent good intake of OO and white meat, especially in the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries, concomitant with a reduced intake of butter and red meat as well as a reduced intake of high-sugar products (beverages, desserts). However, there is still a rather low consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, fish, and wine, underlying the 6–7 points difference between the moderate MD adherence score estimated in these countries and the highest scores achievable as described in the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) analysis.  To fully comprehend the differences in MD adherence between different populations, researchers have long investigated the influence of a range of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.",114f5a13-4c8a-4c20-af7b-d0adb5d7e507
39,methods39," In particular, differences across sexes, age groups, or BMI categories have been examined in various Mediterranean countries (MED) countries with inconsistent outcomes. Some studies have reported no clear differences in MD adherence between sexes in SP and IT [15,16,17,37], whereas other studies have indicated a higher adherence in women than in men in SP, IT, and PT [17,45,48,55]. Regarding age, some studies conducted in SP have reported no significant association between age and MD adherence [16,37]. In IT, a lower adherence was reported in younger people [17], whereas other studies carried out in SP [15,69] and Croatia [55] have indicated that elderly people have a better adherence to MD than young people. The results of previous analyses looking at the association between MD adherence and BMI in various Mediterranean countries (MED) countries are also variable. In GR [70], Morocco [25], and IT [71], an inverse association between BMI and MD adherence was reported.",830c7259-9f00-4972-97b9-313ac86efc1f
40,methods40," In SP, however, some studies have shown no significant differences across BMI categories [16], whereas others have indicated either a higher MD adherence associated with a higher BMI [15] or an inverse association, with subjects with higher BMI reporting a lower MD adherence [37]. The results of our study further support (i) a higher MD adherence in women than in men, and (ii) a positive association between age and MD adherence with significant increases from younger to older participants. These results were generally seen both in the Mediterranean countries (MED) and the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) participants. It should be noted that participants ≥ 65 y were in much lower numbers than the younger groups (partially due to online questionnaires potentially being more accessible for young people) and thus further studies with increasing numbers of elderly participants are required to corroborate the association between age and MD adherence.",055a1661-55ef-4ae5-bfbf-46b9d8a69b0e
41,methods41," Our results also point to a downwards trend of the MD adherence with increasing BMI that was only significant in some of the Mediterranean countries (MED) participant countries. Our study also supports the small size of the differences in MD adherence between sexes, age groups, and BMI categories (0.1 to 0.3 in the Cohen scale), which can be attributed to small differences at the level of most of the individual food items rather than larger differences in a few specific food items.  We additionally explored some other traditionally featured Mediterranean food items not included in the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS), such as whole-grain cereals and low-fat milk products.",6184d149-c156-4201-bac4-914d4554a883
42,methods42," The intake of whole-grain cereals, which contributes to the overall energy intake [72] and has been associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases and a healthier aging [73,74,75], has decreased in the last years partly due to the increased consumption of more palatable ultra-processed grain products and of alternative products such as gluten-free foods [76]. The results in our study show, however, some preference for whole grains (as indicated by ≥50% of the responders), which was also slightly but significantly higher in the Mediterranean countries (MED) countries than in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) participants.",0d8c4fb9-f83d-4d4a-a58d-74a07653c9fd
43,methods43," On the other hand, and although the association between the consumption of dairy products in general and the risk of chronic diseases is not yet clear [77,78,79], a recent study has confirmed a protective role of the low-fat dairy products against the development of metabolic syndrome in a Mediterranean population of the PREDIMediterranean countries (MED) cohort [80]. Our results show a small but significantly higher daily intake of dairy products in the Mediterranean countries (MED) than in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) participants, but, importantly, there was a marked difference in the preference for the consumption of low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese, which was much lower in the Balkan countries, and especially in BG, probably associated with a long tradition of the consumption of full-fat milk products such as yogurt or cheese in this country [81].",8bc10054-2458-4f68-b82f-a420f827982d
44,methods44," Our data support the relevance and interest in evaluating these food items within the context of the studies about MD adherence.  Chronic dehydration has been associated with a worsening of cardio-metabolic disease risk [82,83,84,85], and a positive association has been observed between MD adherence and water intake in a Spanish elderly cohort of the PREDIMediterranean countries (MED) study [86]. In our study, we asked the participants about the consumption of water and other beverages such as caffeinated drinks and herbal teas. The importance of adequate total water intake is invoked by the major national and international health authorities including the European Food Safety Agency (European Food Safety Agency (EFSA)), which recommends between 2.0 and 2.5 L/d for adult females and males including drinking water, water from other beverages, and water present in food [87]. Within the MD, water (1.5–2.",be99dde5-a6a5-452a-9027-7ce77193c938
45,methods45,"0 L/d) is recommended as the main source of hydration to preserve body water balance and maintain an active lifestyle [40,88]. In our Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) cohorts, the percentage of responders that consumed 1.0 to 2.0 L/day was ≈50% to 60%. The consumption of caffeinated drinks reached similar levels, whereas the herbal tea consumption was the lowest, with values below 40%, except in BG, certainly leaving space for some improvement. In addition, we show a slightly lower meal frequency in the non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries (three per day) against the Mediterranean countries (MED)-countries (four per day). Whether the meal frequency per day has a role in cardio-metabolic health remains controversial, but some studies suggest that a higher number of meals per day may have a positive regulatory effect in some metabolic parameters such as cholesterol levels [89].",0f10f97f-2c22-413e-958c-c0af0ea6943f
46,methods46," The degree to which the difference in the daily number of meals may contribute to the MD adherence remains to be established. The quantity and quality of those meals is also an important issue. It is plausible that if more frequent snacks favor, for example, a higher intake of fruit and raw vegetables, this may contribute to improve MD adherence [90]. Further research into these issues would support the development of better recommendations on sustainable and healthy meal planning.  In an attempt to improve their populations’ health and lifestyle, all the countries included in this study have developed and applied national level dietary guidelines that follow the MD recommendations for most of the food items examined in this study, especially for OO, fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, water, sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and red and processed meats.",c84a2490-8af1-4a89-9e91-4f86ec7acc46
47,methods47," North Macedonia (NMK), however, has not yet included OO and wine in their recommendations, whereas nuts are specifically recommended in the guidelines from GR, PT, SP, North Macedonia (NMK), and BG, and a moderate consumption of wine in the guidelines from CY, GR, PT, SP, and BG [91]. Despite the existence of these guidelines, the results of our analysis and of previous similar studies indicate that, overall, a high proportion of the population from the Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries in Southern Europe continue to report unhealthy dietary habits, especially low intake of plant-based foods, disregarding some of the main MD recommendations. It remains essential, thus, to establish how to best promote behavior changes towards a higher MD diet adherence, both in Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) populations. As recently explained by Fernández-Lázaro et al.",ad128b76-17ec-4c96-8e14-0ec8107be60c
48,methods48," [92], the several points improvement of the MD adherence in participants of the PREDIMediterranean countries (MED) study was achieved after one-year of hard work of a highly trained multidisciplinary team combined with a novel model of personalized recommendations, motivation, and direct communication with the participants. The translation of this success to the general population is not an easy task, and a different combination of schemes have been repeatedly proposed: (1) impulse stronger and country-adapted food mandatory policies and guidelines (e.g.",8039a625-dac3-4ae3-aabb-2bdec16ef896
49,methods49,", increase the promotion and availability of traditional, locally produced, and sustainable plant-based foods); (2) reinforce and improve communication and information about the MD as well as the means to get the messages across the population (social media, public events, local retailers, nutritional services); and (3) increase the population knowledge and understanding of the health benefits but also and, importantly, of the sustainability of the MD through specific education programs with a especial focus on younger generations [93]. In this context, the development of national and international networks merging the experience and knowledge of researchers, medical and nutritional professionals, food producers and retailers, policymakers, and consumers would be a positive asset to further achieve our goals [94].",f33ff220-edf8-4529-80c2-8a5d60b8635d
50,methods50," Along these lines, the recent revision and updating of the MD pyramid including the sustainability aspect constitutes an excellent example of a joint effort of a multidisciplinary team from different areas working towards the promotion of the MD [88].  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a web survey (MeDiWeB questionnaire) has been concurrently distributed across the general free adult sample population from several countries in the Southern Europe, including Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) representatives, with the purpose of evaluating and comparing the adherence to the MD using the same index, i.e., the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS). This is also the first time this tool has been used in two representatives of the Balkan countries, BG and North Macedonia (NMK).",2c087d81-fa28-4e92-ad9c-dda0384f4639
51,methods51," We acknowledge that the responders may not fully represent the general population in these countries, and that self-reported data might be subjected to some recall bias, leading to some over or underestimation of the consumption of the different food items. However, since the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) score system is a well-accepted and widely employed method and our procedure achieved a reasonable response rate, we believe that these data provide reliable information about the dietary pattern and main differences between the participant countries. Although we have included in our study the analysis of the association between the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean countries (MED)AS) and specific factors (sex, age, and BMI), we also acknowledge that additional lifestyle and socioeconomic factors can influence these results.",7e6f8e7a-157a-4548-bba6-b1942388af0e
52,methods52," Further, the cross-sectional design of the current study does not allow for evaluating food pattern variations over the year (seasonality) or to determine any cause–effect relationship. Future studies are warranted to investigate all these other aspects.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, this web-based study conducted across several Mediterranean countries (MED) and non-Mediterranean countries (MED) countries in Southern Europe corroborates a persistent deviation from the MD adherence by a substantial proportion of the adult population in this region and reinforces the need to impulse efforts towards the improvement of the dietary habits, more specifically, to increase the current low consumption of plant-based foods.",518df717-b386-4d7a-bed5-59be31c61825
53,methods53, The MeDiWeB consortium involved in this research is constituted by researchers from different institutions across the Mediterranean and Balkan regions aiming at monitoring the progress of the MD implementation in all these countries and contributing to the promotion of a healthier and more environmentally sustainable world. ,98934208-6de1-4cee-bb97-7f0bec8a03f7
