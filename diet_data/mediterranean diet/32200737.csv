0,methods0," 2.1. Reagents  oleocanthal (OLC) (≥95% purity) was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and oleacein (OLE) (≥90% purity) and oleuropein (OLA) (≥95% purity) from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, ON, Canada). MeOH, acetonitrile (acetonitrile (ACN)) and formic acid were acquired from AppliChem, Panreac Quimica SLU (Barcelona, Spain). Hexane, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, chloroform-d, tetramethylsilane and gentisic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) and cyclohexane from Carlo Erba (Madrid, Spain). Ultrapure water was obtained using a Milli-Q purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).  2.2. secoiridoids (SEC) Extraction for Uhigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS Analysis  secoiridoids (SEC) were extracted by a liquid-liquid extraction following the procedure proposed by Capriotti et al. (2014) [48].",a8f1c958-776f-42f4-a960-2ed036a664e8
1,methods1," Briefly, 0.5 g of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was dissolved in 1 mL of hexane in a 10 mL centrifuge tube and shaken for 30 s. The phenolic compounds were extracted as follows: 2 mL of a solution of MeOH:water (4:1 v/v) was added to the tube and stirred for 30 s. The resulting emulsion was centrifuged at 3000 rpm and 4 °C for 3 min. After separation of the hexane phase, the methanolic-aqueous extract was washed with hexane. To ensure the complete removal of secoiridoids (SEC) from the hydrophobic phase, a second extraction of phenolic compounds was carried out from the hexane phase with MeOH:water (4:1 v/v), using the aforementioned conditions. The combined methanolic-aqueous extracts were evaporated under a nitrogen curtain and reconstituted with 800 μL of MeOH:water (80:20 v/v), filtered with polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filters (0.2 µm), transferred to an amber glass vial, and stored at −80 °C until analysis.",8521c604-5bc5-4772-bf7c-a788dedecb32
2,methods2," All procedure was done under UV-filtered light to avoid secoiridoids (SEC) photooxidation.  The calibration curve was prepared in refined olive oil, which was spiked with the standards before extraction at the following concentrations: 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, and 20 mg·kg−1.  2.3. Uhigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS Analysis  The analysis was carried out using a Uhigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Acquity system equipped with a binary pump and autosampler (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), coupled to an API3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ABSciex, Framingham, MA, USA) equipped with a TurboIonspray source operating in negative mode. An Acquity UPLC® BEH C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, i.d., 1.7 µm particle size) with an Acquity UPLC® BEH C18 pre-column (2.1 × 5 mm, i.d., 1.7 µm particle size) (Waters Corporation®, Dublin, Ireland) were used for the main secoiridoids (SEC) separation. The mobile phases consisted of MeOH with 0.",f4fcd5bb-0fe8-432a-8fb1-9c0932cd8f71
3,methods3,"1% of formic acid (A) and water with 0.1% of formic acid (B) and the flow was constant at a rate 0.6 mL·min. The gradient was as follows: t = 0 min, 100% (A); t = 2 min, 100% (A); t = 4.75 min, 46.4% (A); t = 4.9 min, 0% (A); t = 5.9 min, 0% (A); t = 6 min, 100% (A); t = 6.5 min, 100% (A). The injection volume and column temperature were 5 µL and 50 °C, respectively.  Ionization, in negative mode, was achieved using electrospray ionization (electrospray ionization (ESI)) and all the compounds were monitored in the multiple monitoring mode (monitoring mode (MRM)) with the following settings: capillary voltage, −4000 V; nebulizer gas (N2), 10 (arbitrary units); curtain gas (N2), 12 (arbitrary units); and drying gas (N2) heated to 450 °C at flow rate 8000 c/min. The declustering potential, focusing potential, collision energy and entrance potential are shown in Table 1. The system was controlled by Analyst version 1.4.",422d2b7c-b00b-425f-b9c7-a8049d502a91
4,methods4,"2 software supplied by ABSciex, the chromatograms were integrated with this same software.  2.4. Validation of the Uhigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS Method  The method was validated following the AOAC guidelines for dietary supplements and botanicals [49]. A matrix-matched calibration was selected, as previous experiments show low analyte recoveries [40]. The standards used were oleocanthal (OLC), oleacein (OLE), and oleuropein (OLA), but not ligstroside (LIG), as it is not commercially available. Selectivity, linearity, accuracy, repeatability, the carry-over between samples and the limits of detection (LOD) and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were tested. Regarding the selectivity, the ability to distinguish the analyte from other substances was indicated by an absence of the respective peaks at the same retention time as the corresponding standards in trace chromatograms obtained in multiple monitoring mode.",b8597f2d-4c98-491c-8d0b-bcd7f961152c
5,methods5,"  For assessing the cleaning step of the chromatographic method, the carry-over was evaluated. The carry-over is the increment of the signal of a peak due to residual analyte from preceding sample that remains in the instrument [50]. As AOAC guidelines do not have a protocol to evaluate the carry-over, the guideline on bioanalytical method validation from the European medicines agency was followed [50]. Hence, a blank sample was injected after the highest peak of the calibration curve (20 mg·kg−1) and the carry-over should not be greater than 20% of the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ).  The linearity was evaluated by developing calibration curves using refined olive oil spiked with the analytes before the extraction, with 6 concentration points ranging from 1 to 20 mg·kg−1 and five replicates for each point. The residuals were then tested through a residual plot.",2dda47ba-d693-475e-bcde-a820e20296e4
6,methods6," The R2 was also calculated, as were the accuracies of each point of the curve, based on the ratio between the calculated concentration and the spiked concentration; following AOAC guidelines, accuracies between 80 and 120% were accepted as valid. When necessary, weighted regression was applied to improve the accuracy [51]. For calculating the curves with weighting, and without it, and for the residual plot test R version 4.0.3 (The R foundation) with RStudio version 1.3.1 (Rstudio, PBC) software was used. For the rest of the calculus, Excel 2017 (Microsoft SA) software was used.  To determine the repeatability of the method, both intra- and inter-day repeatability were tested. Five replicates of a low-, intermediate- and upper-point of the curve (1, 5, and 10 mg·kg−1) were injected three times on the same day for the intra-day and three times on three different days for the inter-day repeatability.",5ddb5102-d0b0-4424-b70a-48b9e2b7d939
7,methods7," The relative standard deviations (relative standard deviations (RSD)) for the inter- and intra-day experiments were calculated. All the values lower than relative standard deviations (RSD) = Concentration−(0.15) were accepted. Those values are lower than 8% for 1 mg·kg−1, 7% for 5 mg·kg−1 and 6% for 10 mg·kg−1.  The limits of detection (LOD) is the smallest concentration of the analyte that can be distinguished from the blank and by definition is 3 times the standard deviation of the blank. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) is the smallest amount or concentration of an analyte that can be determined with acceptable reliability and corresponds to 10 times the standard deviation of the blank.",b5de29ae-80d9-4662-9553-1fea11cda7a3
8,methods8," The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were determined using the lower point of the curve, calculating the signal-to-noise ratio of that point, and extrapolating the concentration with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and 10, respectively. Then each analyte was prepared at the limits of detection (LOD) and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) concentration to verify the obtained value.  2.5. Matrix Effect and Recovery  The matrix effect and the recovery of the developed method were assessed following the procedure of Matuszewski et al. (2003) [52]. The matrix effect is the change of the analyte signal due to coeluted substances, whilst the recovery is the percentage of the analyte that remains after the extraction.",10089f28-10c5-4958-9407-4be207f0782c
9,methods9," Three different calibration curves were prepared, two of them using refined olive oil spiked with the standard secoiridoids (SEC) compounds before and after the extraction process, named “spiked-before” and “spiked-after” curves (SBC and SAC, respectively). The third curve was generated by directly diluting the standards in the reconstitution phase, namely, the reconstitution phase curve (reconstitution phase curve (RPC)). By comparing the SBC and SAC, it is possible to evaluate the recovery of the extraction. Whereas the matrix effect can be assessed by comparing the SAC and reconstitution phase curve (RPC), as the interferences form the matrix are not present in the reconstitution phase curve (RPC).  3. Results and Discussion  3.1. Analytical Method Development  The chromatographic conditions were established as in a previous study [38]. Different percentages of formic acid (from 0.",550bc8f2-0008-4d0b-9ad3-caa07cbac117
10,methods10,"02% to 1%) in both mobile phases were tested to improve the peak shape and ionization of the secoiridoids (SEC). The best ionizations were achieved with 0.1% of formic acid in both water and MeOH. The ionization parameters were then optimized for each compound to obtain the highest signal through direct infusion of the analytes at 1 mg·L−1. The parameters optimized were the declustering potential, focusing potential, collision energy, and entrance potential. Finally, the dwell time was optimized to obtain a smooth peak. The results are shown in Table 1.  As already mentioned, the coexistence of open- and closed-structure forms of secoiridoids (SEC) compounds hinders their chromatographic analysis. However, we improved the gradient to minimize the number of peaks for each compound and obtained thin and symmetric peaks. These new chromatographic conditions allowed us to coelute the different isomers together, all of which could thus be quantified at the same time.",df65970e-09f9-448e-a90a-10c13c14f73d
11,methods11," An example of a chromatogram for each analyte is shown in Figure 2. oleacein (OLE) and oleocanthal (OLC) isoforms were eluted in one peak, whereas oleuropein (OLA) and ligstroside (LIG) still produced more than one, although with acceptable accuracy.  Finally, when analyzing oil samples with a reverse phase column, sometimes the chromatographic conditions cannot properly clean the column and cross-contamination of samples can occur. To prevent this, Luque et al. (2019) implemented a cleaning step based on acetonitrile (ACN) and tetrahydrofuran, requiring a ternary pump system and an high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument prepared for strong solvents, which are not always available [47]. In our study, the chromatographic cleaning step was confirmed by testing the carry-over in a blank sample injected right after the most concentrated point of the calibration curve (20 mg·kg−1).",1741afa0-5b28-49b2-8584-6d27168498e5
12,methods12," The carry-over for oleacein (OLE) was null, in the case of oleocanthal (OLC) and oleuropein (OLA), despite being a small peak, it was less than 20% of the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ). The chromatograms are showed in Figure S1. As the extraction method includes a defatting step with hexane, the use of strong organic solvents was not needed to avoid carry-over.  Additionally, the use of an internal standard was tested to minimize errors. The best internal standards for a MS quantitation method are compound analogues isotopically labeled with deuterium (D) or 13C, but oleuropein (OLA), ligstroside (LIG), oleacein (OLE), and oleocanthal (OLC) derivatives are not commercially available. Therefore, compounds structurally similar to our target analytes were tested as internal standards, such as gentisic acid and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid. Those were tested at 5 mg·kg−1, corresponding to an intermediate concentration of the calibration curve.",0e6efba0-724a-4a7e-97ca-e1235fe47a7a
13,methods13," However, the resulting accuracies were lower than without the use of internal standards.  3.2. Analytical Method Validation  The method was assessed in terms of linearity, selectivity, accuracy, repeatability, and limits of detection (LOD) and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) (results shown in Table 2). The selectivity was visually checked in the chromatograms, which showed no other analytes except those of interest.  The linearity range was examined visually in the residual plot. In the case of oleocanthal (OLC) and oleuropein (OLA), a 1/x2 and 1/x weighting was used, respectively, to improve the accuracy for the low concentration points [51]. Then, as the curve was built with a weighted least squares method, the linearity was checked through the standardized residual plots (depicted in Figure S2). All the three analytes (oleocanthal (OLC), oleacein (OLE), and oleuropein (OLA)) showed linearity in the tested range between 1 and 20 mg·kg−1.",4c8e8432-62a8-44cb-bd53-99d1012b4816
14,methods14," Other studies report linearity from 3 to 200 µg·kg−1 for oleacein (OLE) and ligstroside (LIG), from 1 to 100 µg·kg−1 for oleuropein (OLA), and from 12 to 800 µg·kg−1 for oleocanthal (OLC) [47]. However, those margins are far below the usual concentration of these compounds in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) [45].  The limits of detection (LOD)s were in the order of 20 µg·kg−1 and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ)s approximately 100 µg·kg−1, which are sufficiently low to quantitate the secoiridoids (SEC) in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) [45]. The limits are higher than those reported by Luque et al. who reported a limits of detection (LOD) of about 1 µg·kg−1 and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of about 3 µg·kg−1, with even lower values for oleuropein (OLA) (0.3 µg·kg−1 and 0.9 µg·kg−1, respectively) [47]. An explanation for these different results is that Luque-Muñoz et al.",54baf569-e2ec-40a7-bf54-024bf66c5615
15,methods15," were using a more sensitive mass spectrometer (a Xevo TQS tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer from Waters) than the one used in this work. However, the limits of detection (LOD) and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of our method were far lower than those achieved with the 1H-NMR procedure published by Karkoula et al. (2014), in which the limits of detection (LOD) was 1 mg·kg−1 and the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) was 10 mg·kg−1 for all compounds [43]. These high values are due to the analytical technique, as NMR is less sensitive than MS [53]. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) obtained here are also lower than those reported by Suarez et al. [40]. Further comparison between methods is summarized in Table 3.  The accuracy of the method was within the accepted limits of the AOAC guidelines (80–120%) for all the concentrations and analytes.",138677a3-c1b2-412c-8394-f52819a84f46
16,methods16," Other studies report similar results: the accuracies found by Luque et al. are all less than 15% and those of Karkoula et al. (2012) are less than 16% [42,47].  Lastly, both the intra and inter-day repeatability of the method were within the accepted margins established by AOAC guidelines, which stipulate that the maximum relative standard deviations (RSD) should be 6% for 10 mg·kg−1, 7% for 5 mg·kg−1 and 8% for 1 mg·kg−1. Similarly, Luque et al. reported an relative standard deviations (RSD) between 2.5 and 8.5% for oleocanthal (OLC) at 594 ng·mL−1 and 24.75 ng·mL−1, respectively [47]. In contrast, Sanchez de Medina et al. showed higher deviations, being 10% for oleocanthal (OLC) and 11% for oleacein (OLE), although in this case the concentrations were not specified [38].  3.3. Matrix Effect and Recovery  Table 4 shows the results of the matrix effect and the recoveries for each concentration of the curves and compound, calculated as described above.",c587db0d-3a03-4070-a556-02c60467cc3e
17,methods17," The recoveries for the phenolic extractions were partial and varied according to the compound and concentration, ranging between 50 and 100%. Suarez et al. also found quite low recoveries for oleocanthal (OLC) (67%) and oleacein (OLE) (71%) [40].  Matrix effect was observed due to the substances coextracted and coeluted in the chromatography with the phenols. In the case of oleacein (OLE) and oleuropein (OLA), the matrix effect was less than 100%, indicating matrix suppression; the values ranged from 50 to 90% for oleacein (OLE) and 20 to 69% for oleuropein (OLA). On the contrary, matrix enhancing was observed for oleocanthal (OLC), with values ranging from 75 to 150%.  To minimize the error due to the matrix effect and recoveries, internal standard method, or matrix-matched method are suitable, both make the matrix effect and the recoveries the same for the curve and the samples, although the internal standard method does not need a white matrix.",12513af1-ba6b-4f6a-a31b-0f61a4155728
18,methods18," In this study a matrix-matched external calibration was carried out to validate the method, it was possible to use this calibration method as the refined olive oil served as a blank matrix.  4. Conclusions  Simple, quick and with reasonable cost analytical methods are needed for the better understanding of our world. In this context, this publication presents a suitable method for the analysis of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) secoiridoids (SEC), whose analysis has been a challenge since their characterization [54]. The best methods up to now were NMR methods, which despite presenting a lot of advantages, require a high time- and reagent-consuming extraction of the samples.",2f100f37-0ed2-4d20-b609-b4c872172492
19,methods19," Furthermore, there is an Uhigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) validated method for Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) secoiridoids (SEC) analysis, which uses a non-generic Uhigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and requires a different sample extraction than the one used for other Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) phenolic compounds. Therefore, in this work, a quick (6.5 min) chromatographic method was developed and validated for the analysis of the main secoiridoids (SEC) compounds in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), using the same extraction procedure employed for the other Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) phenolic compounds, rendering it low time- and reagent-consuming. The linearity of the method was between 1 and 20 mg·kg−1, the accuracies were between AOAC accepted margins, and the limits of detection (LOD) and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) relatively low (in the order of 20 and 100 µg·kg−1, respectively).",8d1e878f-f7a9-4e4c-98a4-a8f136292c22
20,methods20," The cleaning step of the chromatographic method was good as the carry-over was null. This method would provide new tools for a better understanding on how Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) phenolic profile changes during extraction and due to agronomical conditions, such as olive variety or olive maturity stage. Finally, it would help future research to determine better the effect of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) phenolic profile on animal and human health. ",2a0815eb-bb01-4c31-ae29-31f652011a98
