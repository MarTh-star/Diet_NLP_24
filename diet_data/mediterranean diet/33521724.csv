Five of the nine studies included in this analysis were cross-sectional observational studies (22, 25, 27, 28, 30), three were longitudinal observational studies (24, 26, 29), and one was experimental (clinical trial) (23). Most of the studies were conducted using the dietary consumption data from adults, and one study was conducted using the dietary consumption data from school children (24). Sample sizes vary from 289 to 22,866 subjects for the studies including adults and 172 subjects for the study including school children.

14,results9,"  Dietary Patterns  Two studies assessed the sustainability associated with the adherence to MedDiet (24, 27), one study assessed the sustainability of the adherence to MedDiet in combination with organic food consumption (30), one study assessed alterations in sustainability indicators resulting from an intervention promoting MedDiet (23), and the remaining studies compared MedDiet with other dietary patterns. The dietary patterns compared with MedDiet included the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)), the EAT-Lancet reference diet, the Nordic diet, the Western dietary pattern, the provegetarian dietary pattern, the high-protein dietary pattern, the dietary pattern based on the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)), and the Dietary Quality Index-International (DQI-I). The above-mentioned studies used dietary consumption data to calculate the adherence to each dietary pattern.",cb7c3739-295b-48ad-a83b-5f02f1bb1a31
15,results10,"  Sustainability Indicators  Most of the studies used life cycle assessments to obtain environmental sustainability indicators; therefore, reports of sustainability indicators related to the potential environmental impacts of food products were included in the dietary patterns during their entire life cycle (23–29). The environmental sustainability indicators included Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions (23, 25, 27–29), land use (23, 25, 29), energy use (23, 25, 27–29), water use (25, 27–29), carbon footprint (CF) (24), and ecological footprint (EF) (24). The CF is the amount of CO2 equivalent emissions (expressed in g CO2 eq) produced during the life cycle, and the EF is the area of land needed to regenerate the applied resources (expressed in m2). Four studies included indices obtained from environmental sustainability indicators as outcomes (23, 25, 26, 29). Grasso et al. (23) used the pReCiPe score, which is a weighted combination of GHGs emissions, land use, and fossil energy use.",7da29f9d-ea08-49f6-8da2-7dc5e33f43c6
16,results11," A sustainability score was applied by Gosso et al. (25) and Fresán et al. (29), and it was calculated by assigning 0 or 1 points to water, land, and energy use and GHGs emissions of each food product, using the sex-specific medians as the cut-offs (0 for upper values and 1 for lower ones). The sustainability score resulted from the sum of each component ranged from a total of 0 to 4 points, with higher scores indicating a less environmental impact. Fresán et al. (26) used a similar index, called the environmental footprints index, calculated in the same way as the sustainability score but in which participants were classified into quartiles, each of them ranking from 1 to 4. Similarly, the total environmental footprints index was created by summing the quartile values of all the four indicators (land, water, energy use, and GHGs emission); therefore, environmental footprints index ranked from 4 to 16 points.",8a974ccb-ed19-40dd-b8d5-803111e84993
17,results12,"  Three studies included the cost of diet as an economical sustainability indicator (22, 26, 30). All the studies used the daily cost of diet as the main indicator; however, Seconda et al. (30) also reported the share of the budget allocated to foods by dividing the total cost of diet by the income reported by the participants.  Health-nutrition sustainability indicators were presented in two studies (26, 30). The rate of advancement period was used by Fresán et al. (26) as a heath indicator that measures the time by which a rate of a specific outcome is advanced or it is postponed among exposed subjects compared to unexposed individuals, conditional on being free from the outcome at the baseline. Nutrition indicators were used by Seconda et al. (30) to assess diet quality.",bfc65334-5df2-461b-925b-cf026701ad15
18,results13," Briefly, plant/animal protein ratio and three a priori dietary scores were computed: a diet quality index based on the Probability of Adequate Nutrient (PANDiet) intake that reflects the adequacy between nutrient intakes and French recommendations for 24 nutrients, the modified Programme National Nutrition Santé-Guidelines Score (mPNNS-GS) that reflects the level of adherence to the French food-based recommendation defined by the Programme National Nutrition Santé, and the dietary diversity score that evaluates the number of food groups consumed per day.  One index gathered the impact of the daily diet on health, environmental footprints index, and monetary costs; the overall sustainable diet index was designed and reported by Fresán et al. (26).",33a1905a-22b5-4616-9bcd-51f26129ac0d
19,results14," Briefly, for the three aspects, a score from 0 to 3 points was given for each of them, the less suitable value for health, environment, and economy was given 0 points; 3 points for the healthiest daily diet, the one that produced less environmental footprints and the cheapest one. Proportional scores were given for the rest of the values. Summing those three values, the overall sustainable diet index was obtained ranging from 0 to 9 points, with 0 being the less suitable diet and 9 being the most appropriate diet.  Main Findings  The most consistent finding of the studies exploring sustainability based on dietary consumption data indicates that adherence to MedDiet is associated with higher environmental sustainability.  Naja et al. (27), Rosi et al. (24), and Fresán et al. (29) explored the association of the adherence to MedDiet with environmental sustainability indicators. In a sample of 2,610 adults from Lebanon, Naja et al.",efe540d2-5b43-456f-ab53-0114c1bbcd03
20,results15," (27) found that higher adherence to MedDiet was associated with lower water use, lower GHGs emissions, and it was not associated with energy use. Fresán et al. (29) reported that higher adherence to MedDiet was associated with lower use of land, water, and energy, and reduced GHGs emissions. Surprisingly, Rosi et al. (24) found that higher adherence to MedDiet in a sample of 172 Italian school children was positively associated with CF and EF.  Grasso et al. (23) investigated whether food-related behavioral activation therapy applying MedDiet guidelines altered the food intake and the environmental impact of the diet in overweight adults with subsyndromal symptoms of depression. The intervention group altered food intake toward MedDiet; however, this effect resulted in no change in GHGs emissions, land use, and pReCiPe score, and a relative increase in the use of fossil energy.  Grosso et al. (25) studied the environmental impact of dietary patterns in an Italian cohort.",2b6f108b-b981-47d4-ad4e-5400e137390c
21,results16," The authors found that, except for Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH), the adherence to healthy dietary patterns (MedDiet and Nordic diet) and higher diet quality indices (Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and DQI-I) were associated with higher sustainability scores. They also found that higher adherence to MedDiet and Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) was associated with lower GHGs emissions. Naja et al. (28) also found that adherence to MedDiet was associated with lower water use and GHGs emissions per 1,000 Kcal when compared to Western and high-protein dietary patterns. The environmental impact of the Western dietary pattern was also compared with MedDiet in a study from Fresán et al. (26), and it was shown that the Western dietary pattern was the most detrimental one for the environment, while the Provegetarian dietary pattern was the most beneficial one followed by the MedDiet.",2fd1c2b2-3c01-4c4f-8d1e-ec2cf6921965
22,results17,"  Several of the studies also presented data on the contribution of food/food groups to the environmental sustainability indicators. Rosi et al. (24) showed that animal-based products represented 50% or more of the impact on the CF and EF. Similar results were observed by Grosso et al. (25) in which animal products represented more than half of the impact on GHG emissions, water use, and energy requirements. Naja et al. (28) reported that, within the MedDiet, whole dairy products had the highest percentage of contribution to water use, while vegetables contributed most to energy use and GHGs emissions. The authors explained these results by the relatively high consumption of vegetables within the Lebanese MedDiet and the fact that the production of vegetables requires more energy use and GHGs emissions than grains and fruits.",48bedc8d-f1e9-432e-ac79-64284e418387
23,results18," In a later study (27), it was reported that red meat was the greatest contributor to water use, sugar-sweetened beverages were the main contributors to energy use, and red meat was the food group with the highest contributions to GHGs emissions.  Economic sustainability was assessed through the monetary cost. Llanaj et al. (22) analyzed the cost of the adherence to recommended dietary patterns and found that higher adherence to Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH), EAT-Lancet reference diet, or MedDiet was not associated with significant differences in cost. Fresán et al. (26), showed that MedDiet was the most expensive diet compared to the Western and Provegetarian dietary patterns. Seconda et al.",50ed88ba-514f-481e-9507-4e3a94516433
24,results19," (30) explored the cost of the adherence to MedDiet in combination with the consumption of organic food and observed that the average cost of consuming a MedDiet combined with organic food was the highest (MedDiet without organic food or no MedDiet compliance with or without organic food).  The health-nutrition pillar of sustainability was assessed by the study by Fresán et al. (26) and Seconda et al. (30). Fresán et al. (26) showed that the highest quartile of adherence to MedDiet exhibited the best rate advancement period (3.10 years gained), while the highest quartile of adherence to the Western dietary pattern showed the worst rate advancement period (1.33 years lost). Seconda et al. (30) demonstrated that the highest adherence to MedDiet (with or without combination with organic food) was associated with higher diet quality, adherence to recommendations, dietary diversity, and higher plant/animal protein ratio.  Fresán et al.",000ab859-2e92-434b-ba04-83fd0499c41b
25,results20," (26) used an index that gathered the impact of all the analyzed aspects (health, environmental footprints, and monetary costs), the overall sustainable diet index. Using the overall sustainable diet index, the authors showed that MedDiet was the most sustainable option in comparison with Western and Provegetarian dietary patterns.  MedDiet Sustainability Based on Dietary Scenarios  Out of the 28 articles included in this review, 11 analyzed MedDiet sustainability based on the models of dietary patterns or recommendations (dietary scenarios) (31–41). Relevant information from these articles is summarized in Table 3.  Table 3 Summary of studies reporting MedDiet sustainability using dietary scenarios.

35,results30," One study explored the sustainability of different MedDiet scenarios, such as Healthy MedDiet, healthy pesco-vegetarian MedDiet, and healthy vegetarian MedDiet (38).  Sustainability Indicators  Most of the studies reported environmental sustainability indicators, including land use (31, 37), water use (31, 35), GHGs emissions (31, 36, 37), eutrophication potential (31), water footprint (WF) (32, 33, 39), CF (33, 40), global warming potential (34, 35), freshwater eutrophication (35), marine eutrophication (35), particulate matter or respiratory organics (35), and energy use (40). The WF is an indicator of freshwater consumption (from rainfall, surface, and groundwater) that looks at direct and indirect water use of a producer or consumer and water resources appropriation (expressed in liters) (33). One study used a combined GHGs emissions-land use (GHGE-LU) score that was defined as the average of the GHGs emissions and LU score per diet (37, 43).",0e7ec0ff-f633-498a-bec1-1aa79659600d
36,results31," One study reported the variation in environmental load (emission of GHGs, such as CO2, CH4, and N2O) expected in case of change for different dietary scenarios (41).  Sustainability was also assessed in the dimensions of economy and health nutrition. Economic sustainability was assessed in three studies, using the daily cost of diet (expressed in €·person−1·day−1 or €·family−1·month−1) (33, 40) or total changes in output (41). One study assessed the nutritional quality through the Nutrient Rich Foods Index 9.3 (NRF9.3) and Nutrient Quality Index (Nutrient Quality Index (NQI)), and satiety was assessed by the FullnessFactor™ (FF) (34). van Dooren et al. (37) used a health score to assess the healthiness of diets, based on the adequacy of the Dutch recommendations of ten nutritional indicators (food, nutrients, or energy).",b8a2b83e-f9b1-4694-ad24-22a756f0377b
37,results32,"  Main Findings  Studies using dietary scenarios consistently found MedDiet as a sustainable pattern; although, it was not always considered superior to other healthy dietary patterns.  Vanham et al. (32) estimated the WF of MedDiet and EAT-Lancet reference diet in nine Mediterranean countries. The authors reported that the EAT-Lancet reference diet consistently reduces the current WF of the analyzed countries while MedDiet reduces WF to a smaller extent or even increases it. In a previous study, Vanham et al. (38) compared the WF of MedDiet scenarios with the reference situation in 13 Mediterranean cities and demonstrated that the adoption of MedDiet patterns (either including meat, pesco-vegetarian, or vegetarian) would reduce WF. Blas et al. (39) also compared the WF of MedDiet with the American diet and reported that the American diet has a 29% higher WF.",32121b60-b8c9-4039-a5c8-70ea8816d3f8
38,results33," The authors also reported that a shift to the Mediterranean diet would decrease the WF in the US, while a shift toward an American diet in Spain will increase the WF. Despite presenting a lower WF when compared to a typical American diet, the MedDiet presented a higher water depletion, and higher freshwater and marine eutrophication when compared with the Healthy US-style dietary pattern and the healthy vegetarian dietary pattern according to the study by Blackstone et al. (35). In this study (35), MedDiet presented a slightly lower global warming potential and land use, and slightly higher particulate matter than the Healthy US-style dietary pattern; however, MedDiet presented the worst environmental performance in all indicators when compared to healthy vegetarian dietary pattern. The authors mentioned that reliance on plant-based protein and eggs in the healthy vegetarian dietary pattern vs. emphasis on animal-based protein in the other patterns was a key driver of differences.",eeed41ae-dc5f-440f-905c-8ccabe591d26
39,results34," A lacto-ovo vegetarian diet also performed better than other dietary patterns analyzed in the United States, including the MedDiet.  Chapa et al. (34) showed that Lacto-ovo vegetarian diet generated the lowest global warming potential regardless of the nutritional quality and satiety. Considering the nutritional quality and satiety, the authors concluded that high satiety foods can help prevent overconsumption and thus improve dietary CF. The authors also identified animal products, including meat and dairy, and discretionary foods as the specific food categories that contributed the most to the global warming potential. Similarly, Pairotti et al. (40) found that, when compared with the Italian average diet, the MedDiet revealed an improvement in energy use and in CF. Despite that, compared to the Italian average diet, the best overall environmental performance was found with the vegetarian diet in which energy use was 3.14% lower and the CF was 12.7% lower.

40,results35," (33) found that MedDiet had a lower CF and WF than Southern European Atlantic Diet (SEAD) and NAOS, the two recommended healthy dietary patterns in Spain. The Southern European Atlantic Diet (SEAD) presented the higher CF and WF explained by the greater animal source food content present in that dietary pattern. Belgacem et. al (31) compared three dietary scenarios and found that a shift from the European or Western dietary pattern to the MedDiet would lead to land and water savings, reduction in GHGs emissions, and eutrophication potential. Ulaszewska et al. (36) found comparable values of GHGs emissions in the MedDiet and the New Nordic diet. On the other hand, Rahmani et al. (41) observed that, in Iran, changing from the status-quo diet to MedDiet would increase the environmental load. Van Dooren et.",7f821954-794a-4ac4-ad53-58db664926a6
41,results36," al (37) noticed that an optimized low lands diet would result in a lower environmental impact (lower GHGs emissions, lower land use, and higher combined GHGE-LU score) with similar nutritional characteristics (measured by the health score) as the MedDiet.  Gonzalez-García et al. (33) analyzed the economic sustainability and, considering the isocaloric diets, the MedDiet, Southern European Atlantic Diet (SEAD), and NAOS presented approximately the same cost. Pairotti et al. (40) indicated that MedDiet presented approximately the same cost as that of the Italian average diet.

The set of sustainability indicators on the economy thematic area were food consumer price index, cost of living index related to food expenditures, distribution of household expenditure per food group, food self-sufficiency, intermediate consumption in the agricultural sector (nitrogen fertilizers), and food losses and waste. Identified indicators in the thematic area of society and culture were the proportion of meals consumed outside the home, the proportion of already prepared meals, consumption of traditional products (e.g., the proportion of products under the protected designation of origin or similar recognized traditional foods), and proportion of mass media initiatives dedicated to the knowledge of food background cultural value.

Five main thematic areas were identified and included biochemical characteristics of food, food quality, environment, lifestyle, and clinical aspects. Among those areas, 13 nutrition indicators of sustainability were identified and the definition, the methodology, the background, data sources, limitations, and references for each indicator were provided.  Sustainability indicators proposed for the “biochemical characteristics of food” thematic area were vegetable/animal protein consumption ratios, average dietary energy adequacy, dietary energy density score, and nutrient density of the diet. For the “food quality” thematic area, the indicators were fruit and vegetable consumption/intakes, and dietary diversity score.",298f23d4-6afa-4224-aefa-a602da0fbb2d

It is important to mention that this work seems to be a refinement of the indicators identified in the nutrition-health principle published in the work of Capone et al. (49).  The proposed indicators for health-nutrition sustainability are reviewed in Table 6. The business distinctiveness aspect refers to farms/companies (company-based approach). It includes indicators that are not specific to a single product and depend on the whole management of the agro-food company.",71217e89-33e7-44b7-ae4d-120154cbc8ee

The second aspect, the nutritional quality, refers to each individual product (product-based approach). The nutritional quality of products was assessed taking into consideration their crucial nutrient content, these nutrients being specific for each food product category/group. The selection criteria for nutritional indicators in the nutritional quality aspect were based on secondary data from scientific literature and other relevant sources.

66,discussion0," This is the first scoping review of the methodological assessment of MedDiet nutritional sustainability. A previous study (18) systematically reviewed the studies on sustainable diets to identify the components of sustainability that were measured and the methods applied to do so. In this work, we reviewed the scientific literature to identify the main components of the nutritional sustainability of MedDiet and the methods that have been applied to assess those components. The concept of nutritional sustainability is broad and complex and encompasses the three dimensions of sustainability, environmental, economic, and socio-cultural, and also the health-nutrition dimension (8).",b8d11c93-ded2-4763-aa17-a27bbe062130

From the 24 studies exploring the sustainability of MedDiet, none fully addressed the complexity of the four dimensions of nutritional sustainability (environmental, economic, socio-cultural, and health-nutrition). One of the methodological proposals to assess the nutritional sustainability of MedDiet (47) contemplated the four dimensions of nutritional sustainability, as well as one of the methodological proposals to assess the sustainability of typical agro-foods of MedDiet (49). Nevertheless, no study was identified, through our search strategy or through the list of citing articles, applying those methodological proposals.",2007dfbf-28ce-4658-baba-b5e4e4fac443

From the research articles, several sustainability indicators were identified. Most of the identified research articles reported sustainability indicators pertaining to the environmental dimension of nutritional sustainability (23–29, 31–45). Six studies (22, 26, 33, 40, 41, 44) reported economic sustainability indicators and six studies (26, 30, 34, 37, 42, 43) reported the sustainability indicators of the health-nutrition dimension of nutritional sustainability.

No studies have reported indicators regarding the socio-cultural dimension.",f968c451-4d8c-4670-af21-281bbfbd5ea5
69,discussion3," These results are not surprising, due to the large attention that the environmental dimension of sustainability has received over time and are in line with the results obtained in the systematic review of Jones et al. (18) where environmental indicators were reported in most of the identified studies; substantial less studies reported economic sustainability indicators and indicators of the socio-cultural dimension, such as the examination of cultural heritage and skills, equity, and rights, were almost entirely lacking.  Two of the leading threats to global health are climate change and non-communicable diseases, both of which are inextricably linked to diet (20, 50); in this sense, nutritional sustainability goes along with the One Health concept where human, animal, and the environmental health are intimately linked (51).",75e41548-ddad-48d8-9afd-061ccd926e2b
70,discussion4," The One Health approach, by definition, encompasses many fields, including, but not limited to, health, ecology, agriculture and sustainability, economics, anthropology, and the social sciences (52). All those disciplines are also included in the assessment of nutritional sustainability. Assessing the environmental dimension of sustainability is of utmost importance. The emissions of the global food system (from food production to consumption) are estimated to account for 21–37% of total human-induced GHGs emissions, 70% of freshwater use, increased eutrophication, and consumption of 35% of ice-free land, and it is also the greatest cause of deforestation and biodiversity loss, thereby contributing to the detrimental effects on natural resources (19, 24, 53).",f34a93c1-6e70-4e21-819b-5ee9328c73cf
71,discussion5," Recently, the report of the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems (1) indicated that food systems are the major driver of environmental degradation and further food production should use no additional land, safeguard existing biodiversity, reduce consumptive water use and manage water responsibly, substantially reduce nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, produce zero carbon dioxide emissions, and cause no further increase in methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Sustainability indicators to assess those recommendations were found in the articles included in this review. Among the indicators cited, the most used were related to global warming potential (GHGs emissions and CF) (23–29, 31, 33, 35–37, 40, 41, 43–45), followed by water (25–29, 31–33, 35, 38, 39, 42, 44, 45), land (23, 25, 26, 29, 31, 35, 37, 43, 45), and energy use (23, 25–29, 40, 45).",99f70b34-b0d3-4550-a06d-b9a336a82a3a
72,discussion6," Our findings are in line with the previous studies where the global warming potential of diets was by far the most commonly measured environmental sustainability indicator, with land, energy, and water use also frequently assessed (18). Considering the detrimental impacts that food systems have on the environment, it is not surprising to observe the abundance of those sustainability indicators in the identified literature. Most of the studies used the life cycle assessment (life cycle assessment (LCA)) approach to obtain environmental sustainability indicators. This finding is consistent with the literature on the subject, where life cycle assessment (LCA) is the most commonly used approach (18–20, 54).",9e5417a8-1c8a-47f8-a9a7-b1071a9a6be4
73,discussion7," Despite being the most commonly used approach, life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is not free from limitations (55), and other methodologies to assess sustainability, such as the modeling approaches, integrated analytical frameworks, and the proposed adaptive, participatory methods, have been proposed (18).  From the environmental perspective, many of the identified studies consistently found that MedDiet is a sustainable option (25–31, 33, 38–40, 42–45). Nevertheless, some studies relying on dietary consumption data or dietary scenarios reported that in some cases, other dietary patterns had a similar or better environmental performance (22, 25, 26, 28, 32, 34–37, 41), while the mixed studies, based on dietary consumption and dietary scenarios, indicated MedDiet as the most environmentally friendly option (42–45).",aabae93f-a9c9-42dd-931b-2a8a5bd9e42d
74,discussion8," Studies examining the impact of foods on environmental sustainability reported animal food sources as the food category with the most deleterious environmental effects (25, 34, 35). As previously mentioned, MedDiet is a dietary pattern characterized by moderate consumption of eggs, poultry, and dairy products (cheese and yogurt) and low consumption of red meat (13, 14). Furthermore, in its present update, the MedDiet pyramid reflected multiple environmental concerns and strongly emphasizes a lower consumption of red meat and bovine dairy products (13, 56).  Six studies (22, 26, 33, 40, 41, 44) measured the cost associated with the adherence to MedDiet as a measure of economic sustainability. Those studies shed some light on the economic tradeoffs of adhering to MedDiet.",ffcaa0f9-68c7-420b-854f-5d5d5217eb90
75,discussion9," In two of the studies (26, 44), adherence to the MedDiet, compared to other patterns of dietary consumption, was associated with a higher cost; yet, in one study (33), it was proposed that isocaloric diets have approximately the same cost. These results may be explained by the different methodological approaches used in each study but are most likely explained by the dietary patterns compared to the MedDiet. The MedDiet was more expensive than the Western dietary pattern and the Provegetarian dietary pattern (26), slightly more expensive than the dietary consumption of the Italian population (44); no significant differences were observed between the MedDiet, the Southern European Atlantic Diet (SEAD), and the NAOS (33). Monetary cost is one of the key factors in food choice and it is the main factor in shaping the consumer demand; therefore, it will affect consumer preferences and options for a sustainable dietary pattern (18, 57).",e6ffd5e2-6cbc-4e41-a324-ea20b5ecc6d1
76,discussion10," Food prices condition the affordability of sustainable diets. Low prices reduce the income of producers, reduce their ability to invest, and may hinder the development of a sustainable food system. From the sustainability point of view, price is ambivalent; therefore, it is important to guarantee the accessibility and affordability to food choices in order to ensure economic sustainability but at the same time, the affordability may have negative environmental impacts by not discouraging food waste (58). In line with our findings, there is evidence indicating that MedDiet is not necessarily associated with higher overall dietary costs (59).  The health-nutrition dimension of nutritional sustainability of MedDiet was assessed in six studies (26, 30, 34, 37, 42, 43). Fresán et al.",5cb37c75-74da-48fd-b958-03efa03d5163
77,discussion11," (26) used the advantage of a longitudinal study to explore the time by which a rate of an outcome (death, non-fatal cardio vascular disease (cardio vascular disease (CVD)) myocardial infarction or stroke, non-fatal breast cancer, or type 2 diabetes mellitus, whichever occurred first) is advanced or is postponed within individuals exposed to different dietary patterns. The NRF9.3 and Nutrient Quality Index (NQI) were also used to assess the diet quality in combination with FF, to quantify the satiety response of food (34). van Dooren et al. (37, 43) used a health score, that was composed by the ratio between the consumption and the recommendations for some food groups, nutrients, and energy. Regardless of the methodological differences, MedDiet was associated with a better performance in the health-nutrition dimension.",0e8eb97b-d770-4fbd-b957-eae86e0bad8d
78,discussion12," MedDiet has been consistently shown to be a healthy dietary pattern that may reduce risk related to non-communicable diseases (60); and therefore, adherence to the MedDiet or other healthy dietary patterns may be associated with the sustainability of healthcare systems.  The absence of exploration regarding the socio-cultural dimension of sustainability in the identified literature is particularly important, given the critical role of society and culture in the MedDiet. The relevance of this dimension is so clear that MedDiet was acknowledged by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage (61). According to UNESCO, MedDiet is a way of life that encompasses a set of skills, knowledge, rituals, symbols, and traditions, ranging from landscape to the table. Eating together is the foundation of the cultural identity and continuity of communities throughout the Mediterranean Basin.",f8ef0e71-6fe6-4323-915d-dce4ee867406
79,discussion13," The MedDiet emphasizes values of hospitality, neighborliness, intercultural dialogue and creativity, and a way of life guided by respect for diversity (17). Despite its increasing popularity worldwide, adherence to the MedDiet is decreasing due to multifactorial influences, such as globalization, population growth, and socio-economic changes. Food chain modernization has increased productivity and resulted in a substantial transformation of lifestyles as a consequence of rising incomes, urbanization, and changes in the agricultural and food sectors. Those changes threaten seriously the transmission and preservation of the MedDiet heritage to present and future generations (17). Measuring the sustainability of the socio-cultural dimension is paramount for the preservation of MedDiet.  Six studies (23, 25, 26, 37, 42, 43, 51) combined indicators to provide a “sustainability index.",5205917d-114f-46ec-9f98-c5063b69ae62
80,discussion14,"” Most of the studies combined environmental indicators into environmental sustainability indices (23, 25, 37, 43). Fresán et al. (26) designed an index that gathered the impact of the daily diet on the analyzed aspects: health, environmental footprints, and monetary costs. Blas et al. (42) proposed the nutritional water productivity (nutritional efficiency (NWP)) that links water and nutrition. The development of indices that combine all the dimensions of nutritional sustainability may facilitate its assessment and the comparability of different dietary patterns or food products.  We did not identify studies that used methodological approaches covering all the conceptual framework of nutritional sustainability of MedDiet; instead, we identified studies that assessed some dimensions of MedDiet nutritional sustainability. Heterogeneity in the indicators used was found, particularly in the environmental dimension.",c0046022-122e-4ad5-a1f2-c1e51e91983c
81,discussion15," Studies on the economic and health-nutrition dimensions are less frequent and absent in the socio-cultural dimension. Our findings call for the development of harmonized methodologies for the assessment of MedDiet nutritional sustainability. Indeed, the methodological approach proposed by Dernini et al. (47) identified indicators to assess the sustainability of the four dimensions that should be considered. Despite being comprehensive and complete, no indication is given regarding the weight of each dimension or the indicator for a sustainability score; although the authors mention that the methodological approach requires to be tested and further refined in a group of selected Mediterranean countries, indicating that this is an ongoing work.  Traditional and typical agro-food products are at the core of MedDiet (49).",429e5a54-7318-4f2c-b386-9629cc22d81b
82,discussion16," A typical agro-food product is characterized by historical and cultural features and by physical attributes that are deep-rooted to the territory of origin encompassing much more than organoleptic qualities. In the last years, we have observed a deep transformation in consumer perception and in the demand for typical agro-food products. The retrieval of typical and traditional foods represents an attempt to recover the safety and social aspects of eating habits. To form positive attitudes and expectations toward food, consumers need to be assured and informed about the production and transformation processes as well as about their origin and the symbolic values they encompass (62). Typical agro-food products contribute directly and indirectly to the sustainability of the MedDiet in the Mediterranean basin (49). Considering those aspects, we identified two works related to the sustainability of typical agro-food products (48, 49). Capone et al.",30ff3469-e931-49d0-a28c-f3b4c08abb2f
83,discussion17," (49) proposed a comprehensive approach to assess the sustainability of typical agro-food products of the MedDiet. This methodological proposal englobes all the dimensions of sustainability that are explored in our study. The identified work of Azzini et al. (48) seems to provide clarification to the health-nutrition dimension mentioned in the work of Capone et al. (49).  In this work, sustainability was assessed in the environmental, economic, sociocultural, and health-nutrition dimensions. Considering the included literature, environmental sustainability was assessed and defined as the ability to use fewer resources (23, 25–29, 31–33, 35, 37–40, 42–45) to produce less byproducts (23–29, 31, 33–37, 40, 41, 43–45). Economic sustainability was defined as the ability to promote economic growth (41) or the accessibility to the consumers (22, 26, 33, 40, 44).",723b2a16-9624-4f00-911d-8fb951f05c3c
84,discussion18," The Heath-nutrition dimension was defined as the capability to provide adequate nutrition (30, 37, 42, 43), promote health, and prevent disease (26). Despite not being assessed, the socio-cultural dimension of sustainability encompasses historical remains and values, local culture, and traditions; therefore, it was defined as the ability to preserve them (63). Nutritional sustainability is an umbrella term that can take several meanings depending on the dimension that is assessed.  Several considerations must be made regarding the findings of this study. Most of the studies identified are from the countries located in the Mediterranean basin and the remaining are from Northern Europe and the United States. While it is not surprising to find studies regarding MedDiet sustainability in the countries of its origin, MedDiet is recommended worldwide as a sustainable dietary option (64); therefore, studies on other regions are needed.",ff4f2546-db40-4f44-a611-15d5f0c1e5ae
85,discussion19," Comparisons are difficult due to the heterogeneity of the indicators used in the identified studies and no studies used a comprehensive approach that explores nutritional sustainability in all dimensions. Harmonization is essential for the comparison of results; yet, a significant degree of flexibility is also needed to allow for the wide application of an instrument to assess the nutritional sustainability of diets or food products that are, by nature, dynamic. Identified studies did not provide examples of approaches to combine all the indicators of sustainability. Identified articles were published between 2012 and 2021, highlighting the recent interest in the subject. Despite a significant body of literature that meets the inclusion criteria for this review, more work is needed to establish a consensual approach to assess the nutritional sustainability of MedDiet and to compare it with other dietary patterns.  Our scoping review has some limitations.",5c02fdc9-32c8-4d50-946e-f523e7edf436
86,discussion20," A search was performed only in two electronic databases (Scopus and PubMed); therefore, relevant works may have been missed. Gray literature could be an informative source of evidence to this study; however, the sizable amount of gray literature in the field could have dumped the feasibility of the work. The search strategy was broad enough to capture a significant body of literature in the area, yet it is possible that studies assessing the sustainability indicators but not mentioning the word sustainability (or related words) have not been captured.  Our study reviewed for the first time the assessment of the nutritional sustainability of MedDiet. From a general perspective, there is sufficient evidence to state that MedDiet is a nutritional sustainable option.

87,discussion21," To the best of our knowledge, no research has been made assessing MedDiet in all the dimensions of the complex concept, that is nutritional sustainability. In its concept, nutritional sustainability is differentiated from other concepts combining nutrition and sustainability; it does not contradict with other similar concepts (sustainable diet and sustainable food systems) but aggregates concepts from them. MedDiet nutritional sustainability needs to attract sufficient political attention and become a core priority in the shaping of agriculture, food, and nutrition policies; for that, research needs, in a comprehensive way, to reflect the complexity of the nutritional sustainability concept.",cf1fd7c8-d257-4237-a4f9-fa722dd5cc2b
