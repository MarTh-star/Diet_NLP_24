0,introduction0,"The use of the fruit and oil from the olive tree (Olea europea) in human nutrition, health and cosmetics for the civilizations centered on the Mediterranean Sea is documented from about 6000 years ago and continues to be of economic and cultural significance. Recent studies point to the region where the olive tree was domesticated as near Syria and Turkey [1] whereas widespread distribution of the olive tree within southern Europe and northern Africa was carried out by the Romans and Phoenicians. The olive tree continues to occupy a central role in traditions and various religious rituals of populations along the Mediterranean. For example, the founding of the important Greek city-state Athens is associated with the olive tree since it was a gift from the Greek goddess Athena over 5000 years ago [2]. The importance of the olive tree and its fruit has not diminished in modern times and, besides its nutritive value, it persists as a global symbol for peace.",695a1428-766b-4904-8ef0-2d86695ce1a6
1,introduction1,"  Although the health and medicinal facets of olive oil consumption has been widely accepted since these ancient times, it is only recently that many epidemiological and biological studies have demonstrated the positive effects on human health when the diet (“the Mediterranean diet”) includes regular consumption of extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)). These include reducing oxidative damage in the body and lower incidence of cancers, improved cardiovascular health, and healthier aging [3–6]. These health benefits have been attributed to the chemical composition in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). The beneficial health action from diets containing extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a subject of social importance, highly investigated and sometimes open to criticisms as for the trial study PREDIMED.",49f238cc-9f52-4aa6-b8b7-4b0d961eaae4
2,introduction2," This study analyzed the effects of diets supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on a population having major risk factors (smoking, hypertension, elevated LDL cholesterol levels, overweight or obesity) but not yet affected by coronary diseases [7]. Another trial, known as the Three-City Study included 7625 subjects also at risk for coronary diseases and concluded that, in older subjects, high olive oil consumption provided a protective role towards the risk of stroke [8].  Olive oil is unique among vegetable oils since it is obtained by mechanically squeezing the fruit. The compounds found in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) occur in variable proportions due to differing olive cultivar types, processing methods and geo-climatic parameters [6,9]. Olive oils are composed mainly of triglycerides of fatty acids with the monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, oleic acid, always being the major component (from 55–83%).",e305852a-9a81-4a5e-a643-f9546726367e
3,introduction3," extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) also contains two essential fatty acids whose compositions are 3.5 to 21% linoleic acid (a polyunsaturated omega-6) and less than 1% linolenic acid (a polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid). Other important but minor components include phenolic compounds, which are thought to be responsible for the antioxidant effects, including tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol and their metabolic derivatives, vitamin E, and phytosterols. More specifically, tyrosol is an active scavenger of reactive oxygen species and increases the life span in nematodes [10–11]. It also was shown that extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) polyphenols protect against the oxidative damage in human-colon adenocarcinoma cell lines [12].  To evaluate the effects of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on biological systems, we used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans and two cell lines, L6 myoblasts from rat skeletal muscle and human monocytes THP-1, non tumor and tumor cells respectively.",41ebc013-2451-4a78-a243-14d68bb8656f
4,introduction4," The nematode is an excellent model organism due to its well-characterized life cycle, fully sequenced genome, and easy manipulation under controlled growth conditions. Aging in C. elegans, like humans, is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors; thus, studying the mechanism and phenotypical changes associated with aging in C. elegans can inform the mechanism in humans. The phenotypical changes observed as nematodes age include morphological deterioration, increased mortality rate, and decline in locomotion, fertility, and feeding [10]. Application of dietary antioxidants to the nematodes’ growing media allows researchers to determine whether there is a protective effect against oxidative stress and its associated characteristics. In previous studies, C. elegans exhibited fewer characteristics associated with oxidative stress induced by paraquat when also exposed to one of the principle phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), tyrosol [10–11].",1b25d631-bc92-41bf-80bd-eeaad53aa0c8

In this study, we restricted our analysis to hermaphroditic nematodes because males are very rare within typical populations of worms. Bristol (N2) wild-type nematodes were grown at 20°C on nematode growth medium (nematode growth medium (NGM)) agar plates with a lawn of E. coli strain OP50 for food as described previously [13].

Survival and stress resistance assays We assessed the effects of Oro oil on overall lifespan by plating ten L4 worms to each of twelve plates, half containing Oro extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and half without. Each day, for seven consecutive days, we assessed survivorship of the worms. Every other day, we moved the surviving worms to fresh plates (with or without the oil) in order to avoid possible interference of nematode offspring.

Six replicates of ten L4 on each petri plate with or without Oro extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) in the presence or absence of 4 mM paraquat were scored for survival over seven consecutive days and assessed for their movement and response to touch. Worms that did not move or respond to touch from the platinum wire of the worm pick were noted as “dead.” Every other day, the surviving nematodes were transferred to a new treatment plate to ensure that there would not be progeny overgrowth that could obscure survival scoring. The nematodes’ locomotion was qualitatively observed and their mortality was quantitatively scored. Data are presented as the average percent survival across the replicates.",f25de391-4289-4165-a0e8-6e7f1c6aba57
11,methods5," Two-way ANOVA with main factors of exposure time and oil treatment were performed, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons, using Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, Inc).

Cyclic voltammetry Preliminary tests The redox potential for the O2/superoxide cycle is shown in S1 Fig. The main goal was to determine the potential corresponding to the oxidation of superoxide (O2-• → O2 + e-), which is needed to fix the potential at the later used ring electrode in the rotating ring disk electrode (rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE)) system, see below. The related parameter then was -0.25V. S1 Fig was obtained using a Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface, which has three electrodes: reference, working and counter electrodes. The reference electrode was made in the lab using Ag/AgCl wire in solution of DMSO with tetrabutylammonium bromide (tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB)) contained in a thin glass tube.",25691eec-ce4f-4b2b-bb05-913f6e2669da

The rotating ring disk electrode (rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE)) system The main experiments were performed with a rotating ring disk electrode, rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE), (Pine Instrumentation) using a Au/Au electrode with a platinum reference electrode and a platinum counter electrode. Voltammograms from all studies were collected using Aftermath software provided by Pine Instruments. Initial tests were performed using the ferri/ferrocyanide redox reaction to ensure that the electrode was operating within theoretical parameters.

13,methods7,"  Preliminary superoxide tests To test the superoxide/oxygen redox reaction 50ml of DMSO was transferred into a voltaic cell with a 10ml glass syringe and tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) was added. The counter electrode (Pt wire) and reference electrode (Pt wire in a DMSO/tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) solution) were added to the voltaic cell. The disk potential was swept from 0.1 to -2.0V to reduce oxygen to superoxide, and the ring was held at a constant potential of -0.25V to collect the superoxide molecule and oxidize them back to oxygen. The CV contains 2 lines superimposed, further described in the Results and Discussion section.  Water interfering with the DMSO The disk was swept from 0.1 to -2.0 V and the ring was held constant at -0.25 V. The electrode was rotated at 250 rpm at a sweep rate of 25 mV/s. A controlled amount of distilled H2O (range 200 μl– 1600 μl) was then added to the solution; voltammograms were collected after each new addition of water.",9ff9ac36-2c8c-4dea-9eff-8b41af4f455b
14,methods8," Voltammogram results were anomalous at the ring disc due to the spontaneous disproportionation of superoxide (O2-• + O2-• + 2H+ → O2 + H2O2). This well-known reaction, that is also carried out by the enzyme superoxide dismutase, depends on the availability of protons, which normally come from water. We concluded that dehydrated DMSO is absolutely needed for this experiment and used DMSO (dehydrated 99.9%).  Bubbling with nitrogen and oxygen The voltaic cell was prepared with 0.1M tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) in 50ml of DMSO. The polished Au/Au electrode was then submerged into the DMSO solution, and the counter and reference electrodes were added to the cell. A glass gas conduit was added to the cell and nitrogen gas (1 atm) was bubbled through the DMSO for five minutes. Oxygen gas (1 atm) was then bubbled through the DMSO for ten minutes. The disk was swept from 0.1V to -1.5V and the ring was held constant at -0.25V.",893cf0e4-312b-4456-bdd6-2c562005b882

Cells were gently scraped off with phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-glucose at 37°C and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-glucose. The THP-1 monocytes were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min; the supernatant was discarded and cells were washed twice with 5 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-glucose at 37°C to remove the serum that might affect the action of the fluorescent probe.

26,analysis1," Geometry optimized hydroxytyrosol (center) and tyrosol (right) using Dmol3 DFT program; OH groups highlighted in thicker stick mode.  The pendant (CH2)2OH moiety was rotated along the C(aromatic)-C(aliphatic) bond in several positions. At the minimum of energy the hydroxyl moiety protrudes towards the center of the aromatic ring (Fig 1), which is a feature seen in small aromatic hydrocarbons in their crystal structures, in contrast with larger aromatic species that tend to establish a stacking arrangement as seen in graphite. For instance, the distance between H(benzene) and a neighbouring benzene centroid is about 3 Å [21]. Hydroxytyrosol shows a H-bond between the H(hydroxyl) in position 3 towards the OH in position 4 (2.174 Å).  Each DFT minimized compound in Fig 1 was posed for a potential approach of superoxide radical, that is, a previously geometry-minimized superoxide radical and the H(hydroxyl) in position 4 were located at van der Waals separation.",2652010f-f40b-4f7d-afda-c257f03cde62
27,analysis2," The resulting geometry optimizations (Fig 2) show that for hydroxytyrosol there is strengthening of the intramolecular H-bond between the H(hydroxyl) in position 3 and adjacent O in position 4 (2.088 Å) in comparison with 2.174 Å in Fig 1, suggesting an increased negative charge on O(4). In addition, there is a slightly lengthening of OH at position 4 in hydroxytyrosol, with O-H distance of 1.080 Å, compared with 1.073 Å in tyrosol, which is also assigned to the role of H in position 3 in the former.  10.1371/journal.pone.0189341.g002Fig 2 The initial state for reaction (1) between hydroxytyrosol (left) or tyrosol (right) with superoxide radical O2−• obtained through geometry minimization. Initial separation between O(superoxide) and H was set at 2.60 Å, the sum of van der Waals radii.  The product of reaction (1) was studied posing the hydroxytyrosol (or tyrosol) radical and HO2- anion at van der Waals separation (2.60 Å).",f62c1ed0-264b-4fa4-b977-7eeefcb5cb23
28,analysis3," The resulting geometry optimizations are depicted in Fig 3, which shows a more efficient role of hydroxytyrosol as a scavenger. Thus, the cleavage of O-H in position 4 is 1.519 Å compared with 1.385 Å in tyrosol, whose H abstraction is weaker. An additional structural feature is seen in Fig 3, the C-O bond at position 4 (1.317 Å), is shorter that in Fig 1 (1.377 Å), that is, after scavenging superoxide there is double bond character in the C-O semiquinone radical at position 4. This also is in agreement with the pattern of double bond conjugation in the aromatic ring, shown in Fig 3. Thus, the two C-C bonds (adjacent to C-O, both involving C4), 1.427 Å and 1.429 Å, are longer than those in the initial state, Fig 2. The remaining bonds 1.392 Å and 1.397 Å are shorter than those involving C4 and longer than those involving C1.",44139087-e9db-4720-a1d8-ec7856df0957
29,analysis4," Therefore, the aromaticity of the original scavenger has been lost because of scavenging; results from hydroxytyrosol (not shown in Fig 3 for clarity) are consistent with this pattern. The transition state (TS) for reaction (1) was calculated and is depicted in S2 Fig. Related thermodynamic data are Delta G = -8.8 kcal/mol for both hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, whereas the activation energy is 3.4 kcal/mol and 2.0 kcal/mol, respectively. Each transition state shows, as expected theoretically, only one negative frequency in the corresponding infrared spectra, consistent with displacement of H towards O2−•. For hydroxytyrosol the TS is closer to the product than the reagent: the distances of O(peroxide)—H and O(aromatic)—H are1.143 Å and 1.353 Å, respectively, whereas for tyrosol the abstracted H atom is located midway between reagent and product: O(peroxide)—H = 1.232 Å, O(aromatic)—H = 1.260 Å.  10.1371/journal.pone.0189341.",12e76a2e-a0a2-4be7-b4b8-a80c4149feed

From these results it is concluded that the 2 components of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, are able to scavenge the superoxide radical, as found experimentally in our CV study described in the next section.  Cyclovoltammetry The rotating ring disk electrode (rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE)) allows for a precise study of the kinetics and efficiency of redox reactions. The electrode is rotated at a constant rate and the previously bubbled O2 molecules in solution come in contact with the disk. The process at the disc electrode is the reduction of oxygen to superoxide radical (O2 + e- → O2-•), while the reverse reaction occurs at the ring electrode (O2-• → O2 + e-). We focus on the latter reaction (Fig 4).  10.1371/journal.pone.0189341.",77906ff4-7cae-48d3-90c3-ad0b23faa299
31,analysis6,"g004Fig 4 rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) study of dioxygen in DMSO using gold disk, spinning at 500 rpm, and gold ring electrodes. The potentials were referenced to a Ag/AgCl and the disk was scanned at 25 mV/sec. The coincidence between forward and reverse potential sweep at both electrodes indicates reversibility of this process.  The experiment starts at 0.10 V potential on the disc electrode, when the disc electrode has sufficient negative potential and superoxide is generated (Fig 5). The outward flow then sweeps the solution towards the ring (fixed potential -0.25V), allowing the superoxide reverse reaction. This curve corresponds to the CV shown in S1 Fig, as indicated in Materials and Methods section. The method was developed by testing the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE)’s capacity to measure the superoxide radicals in 50ml of DMSO. Since water destroys superoxide we used dry DMSO.  10.1371/journal.pone.0189341.",9fddf6bf-76cc-43e5-a5e4-fa9ca018f39d
32,analysis7,"g005Fig 5 Ring current of the rotating ring disc electrode system showing the decrease in the oxidation current for the oxidation of superoxide ion radical with the addition of olive oil aliquots. The experiment consists of sweeping the disk potential from 0.10 V to -1.50 V and then back to 0.10 V while holding the ring potential at -0.25 volts, sufficiently positive to oxidize superoxide back to O2.  After the first run (blank) was completed (Fig 5), addition of an extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) aliquot (10 μL) results in a significant decrease in the collection efficiency in the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) experiment, indicating a removal of the superoxide in the time between generation at the disk and the subsequent oxidation at the ring. Subsequent aliquots decreased superoxide further, showing a linear relationship with the volume of olive oil added over the range of tested volumes.",2ab0e152-8056-43dd-b4f3-d56b8600b08e
33,analysis8," This decrease of superoxide concentration correlates with antioxidants present in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), able to sequester the superoxide radical (Fig 6).  10.1371/journal.pone.0189341.g006Fig 6 Correlation for superoxide scavenging at the ring electrode due to aliquots of olive oil, as indicated in Fig 5. Collection efficiency is calculated detracting the current at the ring electrode for a given aliquot, at -1.5 V in Fig 5, and the current at time 0, when there was no superoxide yet generated.  A somewhat related study using a classical CV apparatus, similar to that used to generate S1 Fig, also detects decrease of current intensity of superoxide signal according to increasing amounts of flavonoids added to the electronic cell. In such a system both redox reactions take place at the same eletrode [22].",f81a13d6-a0b3-43d1-b56a-195026655473

Cytotoxicity/proliferation assay (measured by a tetrazolium dye (MTT) test) The possible cytotoxicity of the oils together with their protective effect against a radical generator, cumene hydroperoxide, was assessed by measured by a tetrazolium dye (MTT) assay in L6 myoblasts from rat skeletal muscle. As expected, cumene hydroperoxide alone at the concentration of 27.5 μM significantly reduced cell viability. The concentration of Cumene hydroperoxide 27.5 μM was chosen from our previously published data as a concentration able to induce oxidative stress without major changes in the viability [20]. Our results show that neither Oro oil nor Corto oil, tested at two different concentrations, were toxic when given alone.

Conclusions We demonstrate in this study that extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) experimentally scavenges superoxide radicals very efficiently using a novel two electrode (disc-ring) cyclovoltammetry technique, improving a related one that used only one electrode [22], and this is confirmed by a computational approach for 2 components of olive oil, tyrosol and hydroxythyrosol.",54328bef-9dc3-4467-8a6d-49980c253f32

Further, we report here for the first time a direct positive effect of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on two mammalian cell cultures: leukemic monocytes, a tumor cell line, and myoblasts, a non-tumorous cell line from rat skeletal muscle. We demonstrate using the measured by a tetrazolium dye (MTT) assay that the L6 cells were protected from oxidative stress induced by cumene hydroperoxide.

Both oils were able to protect the cells against oxidative stress as assessed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) determination and by the measured by a tetrazolium dye (MTT) assay when exposed to radical generator cumene hydroperoxide. We previously showed that hydroxytyrosol reduced oxidative stress caused by cumene hydroperoxide in L-6 myoblasts [30]. In contrast to the effects of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on tumor cell proliferation, the L6 cells were unaffected by the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), but rather had a reduced proliferation likely resulting from the normal process of cell differentiation.",92fbb8d5-1113-443e-a964-825af125247e
51,analysis26," Other studies have shown these differential effects of antioxidants [26–27], including our own earlier work on chalcone derivative effects on cell proliferation of L6 cells and THP-1 monocytes [28].  We extended these results to intact multicellular organisms by demonstrating that the ORO extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) significantly extended C. elegans lifespan. When the nematodes were exposed to paraquat, a known superoxide generator, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) maintained the survival in 50–60% of nematodes at the level of untreated nematodes, whereas paraquat-exposed nematodes not treated with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) exhibited a dramatic decrease in survival. Stress responses, including oxidative stressors, influence aging and lifespan C. elegans. One recent study identified SKN-1/Nrf as an important regulator of these processes [27], which may be a target of the protective effects of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO); our future work can address this mechanism.",9481630d-10d0-44bc-98e5-18ac3836ed07
