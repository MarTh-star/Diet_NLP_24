0,background0,"Regular physical activity (PA) is associated with numerous health benefits [1, 2]. Adherence to PA recommendations is associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality [3].  Engagement in PA, especially at moderate and high intensities, decreases with ageing [4, 5], whereas multimorbidity increases [6]. Additionally, sedentary behaviors are highly prevalent in older adults [7]. The increase in sedentary behaviors and the concurrent decrease in PA in older adults are positively associated with weight gain and an increased incidence of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities [8, 9]. Therefore, it is paramount to implement PA intervention programs to improve physical and mental health in this growing segment of contemporary society.",210fbe2d-c20c-4533-a79f-887817b09432
1,background1,"  A recently published meta-analysis [10] of the effectiveness of PA interventions in older adults showed a moderate effect size of a difference of 73 min per week in favor of the intervention group compared with the control group. Whether this effect size is sufficient to promote a clinically significant reduction in weight gain is questionable [11]. In contrast, short-term interventions with multiple structured and controlled sessions of moderate to vigorous exercise per week have a higher effect size regarding PA increase in the intervention group, and support weight loss and a reduction in waist circumference (WC) in older adults [12]. However, maintaining such an intervention strategy is hardly feasible in the long run.",1fbd021b-8836-4cc6-a02f-d1b529641498

This study followed the Consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) guidelines for reporting [17].  Intervention The ongoing PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus trial delivers a dietary and PA intervention aimed to promote weight loss and reduce hard cardiovascular events (http://predimedplus.com/) [13]. Energy restriction and an increase in PA are essential to achieve weight loss. The PA intervention is a face-to-face tailored intervention program including goal setting (BCT taxonomy1.1) [18], action planning (BCT taxonomy 1.4), feedback (BCT taxonomy 2.",5936b1c2-471c-4c21-903d-1c3fe7e8ac81
7,methods4,"2), informational materials, motivation, and self-monitoring (BCT taxonomy 2.3). During the first year of the ongoing trial (the time period analyzed in the present study), participants in the intervention group received PA recommendations by means of a tailored face-to-face educational program including 12 individual one-hour sessions, 12 telephone calls, and 3 one-hour group sessions focused on PA. The program was delivered by dietitians who received additional training in PA recommendations. The one-year retention rate was high (89.7%).  During the individual face-to-face sessions in each of the 23 centers participating in the trial, the dietitians explained to each participant the health benefits of being physically active (BCT taxonomy 5.1). Together, they set tailored PA goals and an action plan, taking into account individual preferences and possibilities.",d467ec6b-6de4-4399-a7aa-77ed44927cc8
8,methods5,"  During the first 6 months of intervention, participants were encouraged to gradually increase their activity level to at least 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous PA (moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA)), with the ultimate goal of walking at least 45 min per day, 6 days per week, and doing static exercises to improve strength, flexibility, and balance according to specific instructions. In each individual session with the dietitian, feedback (BCT taxonomy 2.2) was provided on progress toward personal goals associated with other activities that improve strength, resistance, balance, and flexibility. Participants could discuss difficulties in completing individual goals with the dietitians, who provided options tailored to each participant (BCT taxonomy 1.2). In addition, videos and brochures were provided and discussed, and a monthly motivational phone call from the dietitian reinforced PA goals.",70cf858c-157d-461e-96c1-74e6894c3ab9
9,methods6,"  Due to the specific characteristics of the study population, goal-setting for aerobic PA was mainly based on walking. Participants received a pedometer (Yamax SW200 Digi-Walker) and a PA diary as self-monitoring and motivational tools. In each individual visit with the dietitian, participants were encouraged to continue a progressive increase in their level of PA. Fidelity to intervention adherence was measured by periodically administered REGICOR Short Physical Questionnaire (REGICOR Short Physical Questionnaire (RSPAQ)) and pedometers. Additionally, all participants in both groups received free virgin olive oil (6 l every 6 months) and nuts (3 kg every 6 months) to increase adherence to the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus protocol. Advice on PA was not given to the control group.

10,methods7," Education level was dichotomized as having more or less than a primary education.  MedDiet adherence was measured by a 14-item diet questionnaire, previously validated [20]. A 17-item questionnaire was used to assess adherence to the energy-restricted MedDiet and a 143-item food frequency questionnaire [21] to measure energy intake. These three questionnaires were completed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of follow-up. In the ongoing trial, these data are being collected annually.  Outcomes The primary outcome of the present study, change in PA duration and intensity, was measured using the validated REGICOR Short Physical Questionnaire (RSPAQ) [22] at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. The main construct of this questionnaire covers all four dimensions of PA: type of activity, frequency, duration, and intensity. The questionnaire lists 6 types of activities: walking, brisk walking, walking on trails/hiking, gardening, climbing stairs, and sport activities.",191009df-3954-4def-9014-bfeac8ed8c5c

The validation study of the REGICOR Short Physical Questionnaire (RSPAQ) [22] revealed a high reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient for total-PA = 0.82) and a reasonable validity (Spearman correlation coefficient for total-PA = 0.39). Additionally, the REGICOR Short Physical Questionnaire (RSPAQ) was sensitive in detecting changes in moderate and vigorous PA from baseline to the last visit analyzed (week 27). The Spearmen correlation coefficients between changes in PA derived by the REGICOR Short Physical Questionnaire (RSPAQ) and by accelerometers were 0.34 (p = 0.001) and 0.28 (p = 0.008) for moderate and vigorous PA, respectively.

The METs assigned to each activity were then multiplied by the number of times per month and by the minutes per day the activity was performed. Finally, the values obtained were divided by 30 (days). PA was further classified according to intensity: light (< 4 METs), moderate (4–5.5 METs), and vigorous (≥6 METs).  Secondary outcomes of the present study were changes in body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) and WC. Anthropometric variables (height, weight, WC) were directly measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer, electronic scale, and anthropometric tape, respectively.

22,discussion0,"Participants in the personalized PA intervention program in the ongoing PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus trial significantly increased all levels of PA studied after the first year of intervention; a modest but significant increase was also found in the control group. The increase of total PA and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) in the intervention group was significantly greater than that in the control group. Furthermore, increased moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was associated with a decrease in Body mass index (BMI) and WC in both groups.  There is abundant evidence on the effectiveness of intervention programs aimed to improve PA behaviors in older adults [24]; a recently published meta-analysis found a significant difference of 73 more minutes of PA per week in the intervention versus the control group [10].",c07d078a-21c9-45e3-9c31-fc7a0b1623a0
23,discussion1," However, the heterogeneity in study design makes it difficult to determine which intervention strategies and components exert this desirable effect on PA behaviors. There is evidence that setting tailored intervention goals to specifically address questions of when, how, and where the participant is able to engage in PA are a promising approach to improvement of PA behaviors [24]. The PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus PA intervention program was designed to support tailored goal-setting not only for the type of PA but also where and how the activity is feasible. It includes additional intervention components such as problem-solving, self-monitoring, feedback, informational materials, and motivation. PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus trial participants are older adults with overweight or obesity and high cardiometabolic risk. Therefore, setting a daily walking goal was the first choice to increase aerobic activity in this population.",ba0d6edf-4295-4f67-94f0-afbba0217cc2
24,discussion2," As an incentive to complete individually tailored walking goals, intervention group participants received a pedometer, a motivational tool that has been shown to promote PA and consequently improve health [25–27]. The 52% increase in daily moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) observed in the intervention group might be partially explained by the motivational effect of the pedometer.  An increase of 10% in daily moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was observed in the control group, although PA was not specifically promoted to this group; only MedDiet adherence was emphasized, and without restrictions on energy intake. A healthy change in other lifestyle determinants such as PA could be an additional effect of the usual clinical counseling; alternatively, trial effect (either contamination of some portion of the control group or the influence of participation in a study) could be responsible for the slight increase in moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA).",a218ec4c-6ac5-4960-8970-c9494d507470
25,discussion3,"  A recent meta-analysis of pooled data on the effect of walking on cardiovascular risk factors showed a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and anthropometric surrogate markers of body fat [28]. In the present study, Body mass index (BMI) and WC measurements significantly decreased as moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) levels increased, with a comparable effect size in both groups; however, the mean increase in moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was considerably higher in the intervention group. Together with the concurrent dietary caloric restriction in the intervention group, this drastic increase in moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) would explain, at least partly, the significant difference between the study groups in Body mass index (BMI) and WC after 1 year of intervention.",2fa7d903-0685-42b6-936d-c2a84440d7f3
26,discussion4,"  Finally, we addressed the question of whether a particular subgroup of participants benefitted less from the first year of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus PA intervention program. Evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing [29] indicates that being younger, male, a non-smoker, and of normal weight are predictors for being continuously physically active over 10 years. Furthermore, a higher educational level is associated with more PA engagement in older adults [30, 31]. In the present study, these moderators did not meaningfully influence the effectiveness of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus PA intervention, perhaps due to the affordability of walking, the main activity that was promoted. An increase in the daily duration of walking did not imply additional costs such as joining a fitness club or the purchase of exercise-specific clothing. Therefore, adherence was feasible independently of economic status.",35c1b3cb-89ca-4677-8202-c25da8b2788c
27,discussion5," Previous reports have shown that economic costs of adherence to a PA intervention program are an important barrier to participation, especially for individuals with low income [32].  A limitation of the present study was the use of self-reported data to evaluate the effectiveness of the PA intervention. Recall and reporting biases are inherent limitations of self-reported data. Furthermore, it has been shown that data from questionnaires overestimate the engagement in PA, compared to objective measurement by accelerometer [33]. However, it is reasonable to assume that these biases have similar effects in intervention and control groups. A further limitation was that the present analysis was not based on intention-to-treat. Tailored recommendations were focused on walking, assumed to be an affordable activity for all participants, as the first choice to increase aerobic activity. However, program affordability was not assessed.",58afa90a-c0ee-4253-9589-dd7a6b82992b
28,discussion6," The strengths of the present study were the clinical trial design, repeated data collection, standardized measurements of anthropometric variables, and the relatively large sample size. In a multi-component intervention, we cannot rule out the possibility that the dietary component also had an effect on the reported PA outcomes, and vice versa. Future analysis will explore possible interactions between the dietary and PA components.  The study results showed the effectiveness of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus PA intervention to increase daily PA in older adults. Implementation of this program in clinical practice would be an important step to combat the increasing prevalence of physical inactivity. Most importantly, this PA intervention program is affordable for participants.
