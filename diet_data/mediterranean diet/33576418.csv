0,background0," Plasma lipid profile and anthropometric variables are known to be under strong genetic control and the identification of genetic variants associated with bioclinical parameters is of considerable public health importance. In this study, a young cohort of healthy individuals was genotyped for genes related to health and pathological conditions, to analyze the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with different bioclinical parameters, adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and physical activity, studying the role of lifestyle and body composition parameters on biochemical metabolic profile.

1,methods0," Subjects  The study was carried out between December 2018 and January 2021 at the laboratory of Medical Genetics, Department of Pharmacy and Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria. A sample of 92 (44 females and 48 males) genetically unrelated, healthy subjects of Caucasian descent (aged 14–17 years), was recruited from students at the public high school “Istituto Istruzione Superiore”—Castrolibero (CS). Biochemical blood tests were performed to complement the evaluation of the individual’s overall status. Measurements of anthropometric characteristics, body composition parameters, and physical activity levels of participants enrolled within the Italian project DIMENU (Dieta Mediterranea and Nuoto) were previously described [13–15]. The questionnaire of Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD), KIDMED Test, was used to assess the adherence to the MD in the study population with the score ranging from 0 to 12 points.",3cdc335f-a753-48d8-b06f-b0999c471e6f
2,methods1," In addition, the intensity of physical activity levels were defined based on the WHO recommendations (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity) and adolescents were grouped in physical inactivity (Group A; < 3 METs), moderate physical activity (Group B; 3–6 METs), and vigorous-intensity physical activity (Group C; > 6 METs). Table 1 reports demographic and lifestyle characteristics of the participants. Considering that sample integrity is critical in genomic experiments and several variables (e.g. collection and storage) may influence it, 77 DNA samples underwent targeted genetic sequencing.

3,methods3," The quantity and quality of DNA were assessed by using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop™ One/OneC Microvolume UV–Vis Spectrophotometer; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and tested on agarose gel. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis was carried out using a targeted panel including genes and polymorphisms (see Additional file 1: Table S1), [16–29] related to diet, lifestyle, and physical performance/sports, on the Ion Gene Studio S5 platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The genes and specific SNPs were chosen for sequencing based on their significant biological roles in the lipid metabolic pathways and/or correlation with bioclinical parameters. The custom gene-panel was designed online using the Ion AmpliSeq™ Designer (https://ampliseq.com/browse.action) and resulted in 2-primer pools that are able to amplify 200 amplicons covering all the genes, with an amplicon range size of 125–275 bp.",39838da6-2eec-41fb-aa78-1fac2086ffce

The total size of the panel was 37.28 kb. Libraries were prepared using the Ion AmpliSeq™ Library Kit Plus following standard protocols and quantified using the Invitrogen™ Qubit™ Fluorometer to determine the dilution factor resulting in a concentration of ~ 100 pM. Balanced pooled libraries underwent template preparation and enrichment before being purified by using the Ion OneTouch™ ES (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

5,methods5,"  Data analysis  Primary bioinformatic analysis (alignment against the GRCh37/hg19 human reference genome, quality and coverage analysis, and variant calling) was performed using the Torrent Suite™ Software 5.12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), while the Variant Caller Parameter was set on ‘Germline–Low Stringency’ and annotated variants were filtered for genotype quality (GQ) < 5, flow space read depth (flow space read depth (FDP)) < 6, variant quality (quality (QUAL)) < 20, flow space alternate allele observations (flow space alternate allele observations (FAO)) < 2. The main coverage sequence was 30X. To compare our genotype frequencies, 1000GENOMES (www.1000genomes.org/1000-genomes-browsers) and GnomAD (gnomad.broadinstitute.org) databases were used, excluding the variants with very low frequencies (MAF < 1%), since the aim of our work was not to evaluate the pathogenic impact of rare variants.

The class with the lowest frequency is set as zero effect, then the other genotype effects are given as deviations between their estimated values and the lowest frequency class [32]. Both the Fisher’s exact test and Chi-square test were used for evaluating significant pairwise associations and Bonferroni correction was also applied.  The effect of polymorphisms as well as of physical activity, WHR and KIDMED score on circulating levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides was investigated by calculating the explained variance (in percentage) of each of the biomarkers provided by each single polymorphism, WHR, and KIDMED score.",7099e486-eb89-4257-b976-8b3e6f99fc3f

Two hundred and eight variants were found in the three genes of interest (lipoprotein lipase (LPL), FNDC5, PPARγ). Annotated variants were then filtered for quality parameters (flow space alternate allele observations (FAO), flow space read depth (FDP), GQ, quality (QUAL)) confirming the true positive calls. Of the 208 variants identified, 111 SNPs passed the quality filters (61 in lipoprotein lipase (LPL), 38 in FNDC5 and 12 in PPARγ) (see Additional file 2: Table S2). Of these, 33 were insertions or deletions, 77 were single nucleotide variants and 1 substitution.

Of the 24 novel variants that we identified, 5 had MAF ≥ 0.05, 2 had MAF between 0.05–0.01, and 17 had MAF < 0.01.  Single SNP and multivariate analyses  To identify tagSNPs in our cohort we used Haploview software v4.2. Fifty-two common SNPs were identified using R2 value of 0.8 of which 34, 19, and 3 in lipoprotein lipase (LPL), FNDC5, and PPARγ genes, respectively. For FNDC5 and PPARγ no SNPs were in LD unlike some other SNPs in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene (rs11570892, rs4922115, rs1059507, and rs3866471).",5d573baf-a29b-4eb0-8be7-7c551e20e861

As shown, the rs4922115 polymorphism was the first factor in rank explaining the total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol variability (rs4922115, rs11570892, rs1059507, and rs3866471 are in linkage disequilibrium, which explains the analysis result by general linear model (GLM) in which rs11570892 was the only one significantly associated with total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels) whereas the rs316 polymorphism resulted to be the first factor in rank explaining the variability of triglycerides (according to the ordinary linear regression analysis).",65f39724-b3c2-49d1-b9d9-2b89ece65868

The role of many genetic variations in relation to lipid levels has already extensively been studied [12, 35, 36]. GWAS studies revealed that SNPs in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) are associated with levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and more, as well as numerous molecular phenotypes are related to human diseases and diseases risk [6, 37, 38].",3cbaa354-101c-40b3-a0fa-f6c9b60830cc

In our cohort, we identified 111 variants, of which 24 were novel. All genotyped variants were in concordance with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium expectations. The single SNP analysis, performed by linear regression, revealed 26 significant associations (p < 0.05) of which 10 with body composition parameters and 16 with lipid profiles.

In this study, the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) haplotype association results, largely comparable with the single-site analyses, revealed two main blocks (3 and 4) significantly associated with lipid and body composition parameters never reported before. In addition, considering the explained variance effects of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) polymorphisms, physical activity, WHR, and KIDMED score on lipid profile, we discovered that rs316 and rs4922115 were the main factors explaining the variability of triglycerides and total/LDL cholesterol, respectively. The rs316 is a synonymous variant located in exon 8 not in linkage disequilibrium with other identified SNPs, previously described to be associated with HDL cholesterol in a healthy African Black population [43].",dd42edc6-54b2-41db-a994-164cce0f3cbc
21,discussion3," On the other hand, the individual effect of the non-coding rs4922115 on blood lipids has not been previously investigated in other populations except in Asian Indians [44]. However, this study did not report any statistically significant interaction between this SNP and lipid parameters. In our study rs4922115, such as rs316, was part of haplotype block 3 and was in LD with rs11570892, rs1059507, and rs3866471 (R2 = 0.58–0.67). In particular, most of these SNPs are located in the 3’UTR of the gene known to be involved in gene regulation, affecting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA levels, or post-transcriptional changes [45].  Several genetic polymorphisms in the 3′-UTR of different genes influencing gene expression, have already been reported in humans relating to various disorders. For example, rs1059611, significantly associated with increased HDL and decreased TG concentrations in patients with coronary heart disease, affects mRNA stability and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression.",37887bed-45df-40a7-be01-e268eda662bc
22,discussion4," Specifically, in homozygous and heterozygous states, the C allele carriers show increased gene expression [46]. In addition, a functional study of rs6773957, strongly associated with plasma adiponectin levels and body weight in patients affected by metabolic syndrome, indicates that this variant may affect mRNA stability influencing the expression of ADIPOQ [47]. Very often, 3’UTR SNPs influence gene expression by secondary structures, in the form of stem-loops on the mRNA [48] such as rs27770 of Polo-like Kinase 1 (PLK1) which, showing variations in secondary mRNA structures and stability, leads to increased gene expression [49].  Different studies have been strongly associated these 3’UTR-SNPs with HDL cholesterol and TG levels, especially in Europeans [50, 51]. Moreover, it has been previously shown that haplotypes in these regions modulate pathologies such as atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, blood pressure, and obesity [52].",dafaf376-7bed-4575-87a4-dc6b79296f79
23,discussion5,"  Interestingly, the study of genetic variations identified in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene on the molecular and/or phenotypic consequences through genome-wide mapping of the eQTL analysis showed the increased expression of rs4922115 and other 4 unique eQTL SNPs (rs11570892, rs3208305, rs1059507, and rs3866471) in thyroid and adipose subcutaneous tissues, supporting the impact of these variants on the lipid parameters examined (Table 4). Among all these eQTL variants, rs3208305, found to be significantly associated with insulin levels in this study, showed a very strong deregulated expression also in other tissues such as adipose visceral and whole blood. However, determining causal variants, molecular mechanisms and relevant tissues contributing to these associations can be difficult, largely due to the ability of numerous tissues to synthesize and metabolize fatty acids [53].",cd000a37-e3da-4a77-af7e-447b62df4c60
24,discussion6," Furthermore, the concordant deregulated expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene SNPs in the thyroid tissue should not surprise considering the contribution of thyroid hormones to energy expenditure, heat production, and direct regulation of basal metabolism [54].  Overall, despite recent studies suggest that a high-quality diet affects well-being [55], a ""healthy"" lifestyle is not enough to prevent potential conditions “at-risk”. In addition to physical activity and muscle mass, other factors, such as hormonal structure, temperature, and genetics, influence basal metabolism [56]. Our results showed that SNPs constituting the haplotypes were significantly associated with different lipid parameters (triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol), while lifestyle habits, such as adherence to MD and physical activity, as well as WHR did have a low or null impact in healthy adolescents, highlighting the important role of genetic variants.",8c957593-0c95-427f-93c2-6c9e8fd5e204
25,discussion7,"  It is worth noting that the importance of diet and exercise in preventing cardiovascular disease among healthy young adults has been recently confirmed [57, 58]. Therefore, large-scale longitudinal studies evaluating the outcome among these young adults will be helpful for better identification and modification of risk factors in certain high-risk haplotypes.  Several variables influencing the interpretation of data in our cohort and/or explaining different results from previous studies include the use of sampling criteria (e.g. affected population/healthy population; inclusion of very young subjects compared to those predominantly selected, ethnicity, etc.) different software tools and algorithms applied for variant analysis, although the major limitation of this study is the sample size used for association analyses.",46b65dfe-be96-44c6-a74c-b68011cd4b46
