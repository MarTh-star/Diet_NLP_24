0,methods0," We performed a literature search for this review using the electronic database PubMed. As this is a narrative review, no systematic criteria (e.g., PRISMA) were applied. The search parameters included original articles or reviews about patients (any sex, age, race or comorbidity were included). The first search without filters was performed using the terms ‘‘Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)” and ‘‘carbohydrates” and ‘‘fat” and ‘‘protein” for publications until 31 December 2021. In an additional search, the parameters “Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)” and “macronutrients” (articles up to and including 31 December 2021) were searched for. Emphasis was put on the paediatric population. For the purpose of this review, the paediatric population was defined as being under the age of 18 years old. Secondary literature (references from studies and reviews) was also reviewed.  3. Results  3.1.",f5362833-c69c-40b2-9a3b-98df6af83be3
1,methods1," General Findings  The first literature search resulted in 1049 articles and the second search resulted in 754 publications. Two of the authors (TP and DF) reviewed the articles. After screening the titles and abstracts, a total of 361 articles of relevance remained. Of these, 283 were used to write this narrative review.  At present, there is no specific diet that is universally recommended for nutritional therapy in paediatric patients with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). Overall, most studies and societal guidelines give general recommendations, mentioning a low-caloric healthy diet (low in carbohydrates, fructose, saturated fatty acids and trans-fatty acids, but prioritising low-glycaemic-index foods) [63,64]. With regards to lifestyle interventions and weight reduction, no systematic difference is made between children and adolescents with obesity and/or Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [65,66].",1c9992b1-36db-4d66-9883-ad30e6480f0a
2,methods2,"  The American Heart Association suggests a balanced diet consisting of vegetables, fruits, low saturated fats, whole grain and fish, with low fructose and salt intake [67,68]. While some authors state that no diet is clearly superior, some advocate for the Mediterranean Diet [57,69,70,71,72,73]. Avoiding the overconsumption of the previously mentioned macronutrients and therefore the resulting obesity is a key point in preventing and treating Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [74]. No author or guideline mentioned a concrete caloric restriction, specific meal composition, meal frequencies and distribution of macronutrients (e.g., protein in the evening and carbohydrates in the morning) or a specific recommendation that differed from general healthy diet recommendations.",d636a3ed-daca-4a7f-9b03-1d5c2af55f6e
3,methods3," Dietary recommendations are generally observation based and there has been only a small number of randomised controlled trials of diet as a monotherapeutic approach for paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [57,68,75].  As most patients with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) suffer from obesity or overweightness, caloric restriction is a consistent recommendation for the treatment of adults and children with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). However, some controversy remains regarding the role of caloric restriction in treating paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [76]. Mouzaki et al. argue that it is difficult to clarify the role of a specific macronutrient vs. the total caloric intake [69]. Eslamparast et al. state that caloric restriction is the most important element in the dietary treatment of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).",7e01489d-e8cb-4dbb-958c-7bf1da504af6
4,methods4," Special emphasis is put on the avoidance of high amounts of carbohydrates, simple sugars, fat and protein, as well as low fibre intake [74].  A general point of agreement is that the quality of the macronutrient is essential, as is an individualised approach to therapy. A poor-quality diet (e.g., convenience foods and those high in saturated fat and sugars) may even cause Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in the absence of obesity [74,75,77,78]. Panera argues that the composition of macro- and micronutrients is more important in the pathogenesis and treatment of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) than the total energy intake [43]. Another point of agreement is that nutritional intervention should be paired with physical exercise and the reduction of sedentary behaviour [57,67].",421aa3ba-b521-4907-882f-1c89b3cb5539
5,methods5," Recent studies suggest that a reduction in the intake of simple carbohydrates (especially high fructose/sucrose) and saturated fats benefits the prevention of paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [46,63,74]. There is evidence for a metabolic threshold. This describes a relative body fat content that needs to be achieved before high amounts of fructose and other high-caloric macronutrients lead to hepatic and metabolic impairment [79]. The consumption of food enriched in fat and fructose may alter the gut microbiome and the intestinal barrier function, thus leading to endotoxemia and low-grade inflammatory processes [43,80,81].  3.2. Macronutrients  Although general recommendations for macronutrients exist (see above), the influence of macronutrient intake and composition in paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) remains a topic of major interest.  Vos et al.",861cb1e7-322f-4513-b3b0-860dc772e4cd
6,methods6," stated that there was no significant difference between the fraction of calories consumed from fat, carbohydrates and protein in children with steatosis and non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [82]. Anderson et al. reported inconsistent associations between absolute macronutrient intake and liver outcomes. They found evidence neither for a particular macronutrient, nor that intake at a particular age was strongly associated with hepatic outcomes [83]. Similarly, Gibson et al. found no significant differences in macro- and micronutrient intake between biopsy-proven paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and obese controls. Therefore, they recommended that paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) patients should follow general paediatric recommendations for weight loss and not specific guidelines [84]. These three studies contradict general findings focusing on fat and carbohydrate reduction (especially fructose) as primary targets in nutritional intervention.",c14e00df-6f50-486c-86e5-bf8db526611a
7,methods7," In the following paragraphs, each macronutrient is reviewed on its own.  3.2.1. Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates—General Recommendations  The World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) currently recommends a reduction of free sugar (primarily sucrose and fructose) intake to less than 10% daily of the total energy intake (see Table 1 for World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations) [85]. In general, the majority of calories consumed are provided by carbohydrates. The intake of total energy and carbohydrates are higher in children and adolescents with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) than in healthy children [86]. Carbohydrates can be grouped into sugars—monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides—and sugar alcohols. While several carbohydrates have been associated with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), the primary focus is on fructose [69,87].",5c9cc424-9802-4594-b47b-465001f86697
8,methods8," In addition, added sugar that stems from glucose and fructose is pivotal to Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) development [86]. For example, in US adolescents, average consumption of 94 g of added sugar daily, equalling 17.9% of energy intake, has been reported [53,54,88,89,90].  Carbohydrates in the Pathogenesis of Paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)  A diet rich in carbohydrates provides the major source for hepatic free-fatty-acid (FFAs) synthesis. In children with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), the production of FFAs from carbohydrates contributes 30% of the total FFAs, whereas in healthy children, high carbohydrate intake produces only 5% of total FFAs [95]. The effect of carbohydrate conversion to triglycerides and development of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has been more closely associated with fructose and sucrose than with glucose [96].",961e0f27-4066-488a-930e-c2ccc59edcf0
9,methods9,"  Additional glucose promotes lipid synthesis via the activation of the transcription factor carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP). Dietary glucose and fructose have different effects on mitochondrial protein acetylation and malonyl-CoA. This results in a greater reduction in fatty acid (FA) oxidation and greater lipid synthesis in response to the extra-fructose diet compared with the extra-glucose diet [97,98,99].  Carbohydrates in Treatment and Prevention of Paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)  Low-carbohydrate diets may improve weight loss and reduces hepatic steatosis, as well as reduce triglycerides (TGs) and increase the HDL levels [100,101,102,103]. In a 2019 study, Schwimmer et al. investigated 11–16-year-old boys with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) (≥10% liver fat content). The boys were assigned to either a low-sugar diet or a regular control diet.",f6a8cf55-dd94-401e-84a2-7b72a3cccc89
10,methods10," The study aimed to provide less than 3% of their daily energy from added sugars (intervention). During the study, the low-sugar diet reduced the liver fat content by 8% (compared with 1% in the control diet group). No significant changes in TGs or fasting insulin were noted, but there was an improvement in plasmatic liver enzymes [104]. In a 2020 study, Goss et al. reduced the liver fat content by 6% via a carbohydrate-reduced diet over the course of 8 weeks. In this study, girls and boys with obesity and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) were assigned to either a low-carbohydrate or a low-fat diet. The low-fat diet resulted in a reduction in liver fat of 1%. The study demonstrated carbohydrate restriction as being superior to a low-fat diet when the daily caloric requirement was maintained, not only resulting in a reduction in the hepatic fat content, but also an improvement in insulin resistance [76].",8ea97457-b251-4817-be89-fa510b8ea55a
11,methods11,"  Both studies provide evidence that a general reduction in carbohydrates can result in a reduction in the hepatic fat content and improvement in metabolic parameters.  Fructose and Sucrose—Fructose and Sucrose in the Epidemiology and Pathogenesis of Paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)  The consumption of fructose has increased over the past several hundred years and dramatically over the past few decades in parallel with the consumption of sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup (high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)) [91]. Since the 1980s, an increase as high as 300% over a period of 20 years has been recorded. Studies claim that fructose may be as addictive as certain drugs [87,105,106]. The consumption of fructose and sucrose has equalled the epidemic rise in paediatric obesity and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [69,91,107,108,109,110,111,112,113].",562045e6-86bf-475a-8469-1f5fed0166b0
12,methods12,"  In its natural form, fructose and sucrose can be found in fruits, vegetables and a great number of foods and beverages. Fructose, sucrose and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) can also be found in large quantities in processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages. This is especially relevant as children and adolescents with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) consume significantly more soft drinks than the general population [114]. Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) patients generally consume nearly two to three times more fructose (365 kcal) than healthy controls (170 kcal) [38]. It is relevant that the majority of fructose does not come from fruits or vegetables in paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) patients, but from processed foods. In a collective of 8–16-year-olds, only 25% of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) patients consumed one or more fruits per day. In normal-weight children, daily fruit consumption was the case in 64.",ee98da8c-fa79-4538-a465-e36c502df9aa
13,methods13,"7%, and in 45% of children with obesity but without Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). In contrast, an epidemiological study from Finland found an inverse relationship between fructose intake and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). However, in this study, the majority of fructose was consumed through fruit intake. Fruits contain less fructose than soft drinks and processed foods, but also contain constituents (flavanols, epicatechin, ascorbate and other antioxidants) that may antagonise the negative metabolic and inflammatory effects of fructose [115,116].  In 2014, Sullivan et al. demonstrated that the absorption and metabolisation of fructose is more effective in children with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) than in lean, healthy children, and also resulted in an exacerbated metabolic profile [117]. Fructose and sucrose were found to interact with transcriptional factors affecting the gene expression involved in glycolysis and lipogenesis [118].",609d5aea-619e-4ee8-a492-52c58eeb70da
14,methods14,"  Studies have demonstrated that fructose is associated with increased insulin resistance, leptin resistance and a decrease in adiponectin (the latter two being hormones produced by adipocytes) [69,110,111]. Leptin resistance is induced by chronic fructose consumption. Even before weight gain, it aggravates high-fat-induced obesity. This effect is fully reversible when fructose is eliminated from the diet. Leptin is an anorexigenic hormone; hence, in leptin resistance, satiety cannot be achieved [110,111]. Adiponectin is decreased in patients with obesity and involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. High-fructose diets also reduce the activity of PPARα and hepatic lipid oxidation, and stimulate NF-kB expression. In animal studies, this has led to oxidative stress, as well as hepatic steatosis and hepatic fibrosis. Fructose is absorbed in the small intestine via the GLUT5 transporter and is taken up by the liver, testes and other organs.",525ba857-282a-46c6-9cc5-6cf3fffa821b
15,methods15," (Over)consumption of a fructose-rich diet induces de novo lipogenesis, causing elevated triglyceride and cholesterol levels with dyslipidaemia [119].  Whether fructose consumption induces gut leakiness and intestinal dysbiosis remains under discussion [120]. Sullivan et al. suggested altered intestinal bacterial flora fermentation (fructose into hydrogen) or an up-regulation of the GLUT5 transporter in the intestinal epithelium to be at the root of dysbiosis [117]. Jones at al. reported that a high-fructose diet was associated with lower abundance of beneficial microbes (Eubacterium and Streptococcus), which are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, aiding dysbiosis [121]. A 2020 study by Aleman et al. demonstrated that a daily dose of 75 g of fructose in obese patients did not cause increased gut permeability or endotoxemia [122].",a185cdff-4215-4b60-89b6-cf39c8085f77
16,methods16," This contradicts previous reports that stated that fructose causes bacterial overgrowth, an increase in intestinal permeability, precipitating endotoxemia and, hence, the initiation of an inflammatory cascade driving the progression of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [123,124].  It has been reported that regular consumption of fructose or sucrose in a caloric-stable diet increases the synthesis of fatty acid synthesis, an effect that is not present with glucose [125]. Studies on isocaloric diets using sucrose (glucose–fructose disaccharide) or a 50:50 mixture of glucose and fructose showed that the mixture of monosaccharides induced slightly more steatosis of the liver [126]. Studies have also shown the additive effect of a diet high in fat and sucrose on the development of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [127].",b305b397-3722-4910-9fcc-398e2752d506
17,methods17,"  Fructose and Sucrose—Fructose and Sucrose in the Treatment and Prevention of Paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)  In nutritional studies, it has been shown that lowering fructose, sucrose and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) intake may be protective against the development of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in children with obesity. As sucrose is 50% fructose and 50% glucose, it must be considered that a reduced intake of sucrose also results in a reduced intake of fructose. Studies cited in this review specifically listed fructose or sucrose. The amount of fructose was shown to be more relevant than the total amount of carbohydrates in general, and the amount of fructose consumed at the age of 14 years old was a predictor of the presence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) at the age of 17 years [128]. Studies reported that it normally takes at least 8–24 weeks of a high fructose-diet to develop Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [129].",6a160452-5aac-4163-94be-16800dcafb6d
18,methods18," Fructose-induced Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is also able to develop in the absence of weight gain [130]. Even short-term interventions of nine days of isocaloric fructose restriction could show decreases in liver fat, visceral adipose tissue and de-novo lipogenesis, as well as improved insulin profiles [131]. The fructose and low glycemic index/load (FRAGILE) study was able to demonstrate that a decrease in fructose intake reduces markers of liver dysfunction in children and adolescents with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [79]. In a study by Jin et al. during a 4-week randomised controlled double-blinded beverage intervention study, it was reported that reduction in dietary fructose in Hispanic American adolescents with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) improved several plasma markers associated with metabolic syndrome (e.g., adipose insulin sensitivity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and low-density lipoprotein oxidation) [132].",73f8ff83-dd84-4689-bbfa-66797b388633
19,methods19,"  In healthy subjects, trials of a 4-week moderate (1.5 g/kg/day) and 7-day high-fructose (3.5 g/kg/day) supplementation demonstrated the negative effects of additional fructose. In the 7-day trial, dyslipidaemia and ectopic lipid deposition in the liver and muscles occurred, while the moderate 4-week modification led to an increase in the plasmatic TG and glucose levels [133,134]. This is in accordance with adult data, showing that even shorter periods (6 days) are sufficient to induce dyslipidaemia, as well as hepatic and adipose tissue insulin resistance in healthy subjects with a high-fructose diet (3 g/kg/day) [135].  Despite these findings, fructose is not universally believed to cause Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) on its own. It is, however, thought that fructose may favour Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) progression on the basis of pre-existing risk factors (e.g., obesity, metabolic syndrome or diabetes) [136,137]. Silbernagel et al.",5be6124c-c92f-4ac1-8a0e-f1b0e4b58be4
20,methods20," added 150 g/d of fructose or glucose to an otherwise balanced, weight-maintaining diet for 4 weeks in a collective of adolescents. No changes in the amount of hepatic, visceral and subcutaneous fat were found [138].  Fructose is rarely consumed alone, and the effects of fat and fructose have been demonstrated to be additive in the progression of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). A dietary combination of high fat and fructose resulted in a higher risk of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and liver fibrosis in adult and rodent studies [128,139].  Sugar-Sweetened Beverages and Energy Drinks  Sugar-sweetened beverages or soft drinks (soda, soda pop, cola and tonic) are beverages with a generous amount of high-fructose (corn syrup) or an equally high amount of sucrose [140,141,142]. Over the previous few decades, paediatric consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, energy drinks and alcohol has increased dramatically [143].",da6b49d5-766d-4a73-a7a7-786e35b66857
21,methods21," In a study conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)), 68% of adolescents and 18% of children consumed sugary (energy) drinks on a regular basis [144]. The consumption of soft drinks is associated with paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and the severity of hepatic fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner [38,87,92,137,145,146].  In adults, consuming more than one soft drink per day (360 mL) was associated with increased risk of the development of metabolic syndrome [147,148]. Table 2 provides a summary of the results for carbohydrates and paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).  3.2.2. Fat  Fat—General Recommendations  The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the total fat intake should not exceed 30% of the total energy intake.",9a5fea34-93e7-496b-887e-b060fac7b908
22,methods22," The intake of saturated fats should be less than 10% and trans-fat intake should be less than 1% of the total energy intake (see Table 1 for World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations). Furthermore, a shift in the fat consumption away from saturated fats and trans-fats to unsaturated fats is recommended, with the aim of eliminating industrially produced trans-fats [152]. The American Heart Association (American Heart Association (AHA)) advises to keep the daily fat intake between 30 and 35 percent of calories for children 2 to 3 years of age and between 25 and 35 percent of calories for children and adolescents 4 to 18 years of age. Most fats should come from sources of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, such as fish, nuts and vegetable oils [153].  Fat in the Pathogenesis of Paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)  Consumed fat is mainly TGs that are processed in the intestine and resorbed by enterocytes.",caa750f1-8344-4a06-a394-95fce4caf88a
23,methods23," Cholesterol is only resorbed at a small percentage from animal products (e.g., eggs and meat). Fatty acids (FA) then reach the liver, where they can either be esterificated or oxidated and accumulated or secreted. FA can be differentiated into saturated FA (saturated FA (SFA)), monounsaturated (MUFAs) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) [154,155].  There is an association between fat intake and increased risk of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). As with carbohydrates, it is more dependent on the type of fat than the total amount consumed [46,156,157]. As previously mentioned, fat and carbohydrates (especially fructose) exert an additive effect when causing Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in the paediatric population [128,139]. A fat-rich diet has been found to induce hepatic steatosis and visceral adiposity [158,159]. Fat-reduced isocaloric diets have also been able to reduce the liver fat content [160].",36420379-4924-40e4-88b9-8ed492e69169
24,methods24,"  The quality of fat is not only essential in nutrients, but also on a plasmatic level. Mitchel et al. reported that reducing free fatty acids in the blood flow towards the liver improves steatosis, insulin sensitivity and ALT [75]. In this context, hepatic lipotoxicity is not solely caused by triglyceride accumulation per se, but induced by free fatty acids, free cholesterol and different lipid metabolites (e.g., lysophosphatidylcholine) [161,162].  Fat in the Treatment and Prevention of Paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)  Exchanging saturated fatty acids with polyunsaturated (PUFAs) or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), as advised by the World Health Organization (WHO), within isocaloric diets has been shown to improve hepatic fat accumulation [163,164]. Nutritional MUFAs can be found in natural foods, such as milk products, nuts, olive oil, red meat and high-fat fruits, such as olives and avocados [165].",d3ce7e27-e9c3-4764-a6cc-0fb8415fe41d
25,methods25," Sunflower oil contains as much as 85% MUFA, and olive oil contains 75% MUFAs. MUFAs reduce the LDL cholesterol, oxidised LDL, TC and TGs levels without decreasing HDL. Replacing carbohydrates and saturated fats with MUFAs reduces glucose and blood pressure and increases HDL in diabetic subjects [165,166,167,168,169]. Nutritional PUFAs can be found in walnuts, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, peanut butter and peanuts, flaxseed, poppy seeds, avocado oil, olive oil and safflower. The types of PUFA are omega-3 (ω-3) and omega-6 (ω-6) fatty acids. Examples of ω-3 fatty acids are docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), linolenic acid (plant oil) and eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) (fish oil). Sources of ω-6 fatty acids include eggs, whole-grain foods, walnuts, pumpkin seeds and pine nuts [170]. ω-3 fatty acids are beneficial; however, ω-6 fatty acids should be avoided due to their ability to increase inflammatory processes [171].",4bb7e37f-35e7-42c1-9e70-516e7069dda3
26,methods26," Ω-3 fatty acids are ligands of PPAR-α. Low levels of ω-3 PUFAs impair hepatic PPAR-α activity. This decreases mitochondrial lipid β-oxidation and upregulates lipogenic transcriptor factors (e.g., sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c) [93,172].  In adult non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients, not only a high intake of ω-6 fatty acids, but also an abnormal ω-3/ω-6 ratio has been reported [173]. The recommended ω-3/ω-6 ratio is 1:1 to 1:4. A reduction of saturated FA (SFA)s in the daily diet and sufficient consumption of ω-3 fatty acids to improve Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in children is advised [70,174,175].",78c21411-1154-442f-948d-e13de23759f8
27,methods27," Contrastingly, ω-3 fatty acid supplementation over the course of 6 months in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) children did not improve the ALT levels [132,176,177], while, in another study, the supplementation of ω-3 fatty acids in children with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) over a period of 18 months improved the ALT levels significantly [70].  Diets poor in PUFAs have shown clear association with the development of paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [178,179]. The increased consumption of saturated long-chain fatty acids (SLCFAs, e.g., palmitic acid, myristic acid and stearic acid), particularly in animal products, causes mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress as well as low-grade inflammation [180].  SLCFAs also increase insulin resistance (IR), and the avoidance of SLCFAs benefits IR [181,182].  Furthermore, Anderson et al.",b5cf9ce7-b115-4cd5-a36e-d13afebe06c0
28,methods28," stated that the results on fat and paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) remain controversial. Saturated fatty acids (saturated FA (SFA)s) have been reported to increase steatosis of the liver proportionally to consumption, as have a high percentage of saturated and a low percentage of polyunsaturated fat consumption in paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). In a different study, the association between saturated fat intake and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) was reported to be inverse, while in another collective, no association between saturated fat intake and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) could be made [82,83,183,184,185]. Table 3 provides a summary of the results for fat and paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).  3.2.3. Protein  Protein—General Recommendation  The World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)) recommend a protein intake of 0.",069b87a4-3d13-4f37-b964-b1c670948b7f
29,methods29,"9 g/kg/day from 3 to 18 years of age for boys and from 3 to 15 years of age for girls. Between 15 and 18 years of age, the amount decreases slightly for girls to 0.8 g/kg/day (see Table 1 for World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations) [92].  Protein in the Pathogenesis of Paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)  Protein is the least-studied macronutrient concerning pathophysiology and nutritional intervention in paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [46,186]. From a physiological point of view, protein intake is important for hepatocyte regeneration; it also provides important amino acids for preventing hepatic fat deposition [187].  A number of studies have reported a significantly higher protein intake in patients with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) than in healthy individuals [188,189,190,191], while others found no difference [77,192].",8c69a623-424f-42b7-8ceb-64ae3e9a8bef
30,methods30," Elevated protein intake may have both beneficial and harmful effects on Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). Some authors report that high protein intake reduces the hepatic fat content [193,194]; other authors, however, suggest that it may increase hepatic fatty acid oxidation and the secretion of fatty acids from the liver [156]. High protein intake may be harmful by influencing gut microbiota fermentation, as it may lead to SCFAs and other intestinal metabolites (e.g., phenols, branched-chain fatty acids and ammonia), thus possibly harming the intestinal barrier’s integrity [195]. A moderate-protein diet (25% of total energy intake) was reported to be without side effects and to reduce the body fat content, similar to a high-protein diet. Hence, authors have proposed a moderate protein diet for Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) patients [196].",268b0c79-b852-4951-8c90-dd24adc14a43
31,methods31,"  However, other studies report that malnutrition and protein deficiency also induce hepatic steatosis and non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [187,197], and are associated with excessive triglyceride storage and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [198]. A low-protein diet by itself may lead to IR, high blood pressure and lipid abnormalities. These mechanisms are also involved in the development of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [100,199,200].  Protein in the Treatment and Prevention of Paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)  Special diets that are high in protein and low in carbohydrate improve insulin homeostasis, the lipid profile and liver enzymes. Soy protein has been shown to reduce the plasma cholesterol levels and fat deposition in non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [201]. Table 4 provides a summary of the results for protein and paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).  3.3. Special Issues  3.3.1.",11838958-1268-4b37-a5ab-e7a849789e75
32,methods32," Diets  While macronutrients are of great interest, studies tend to compare diets. Results on what the ideal dietary intervention for paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is remain controversial and, in meta-analysis, no diet has been identified to be superior so far [68]. Long-term compliance with diets is poor and reduced adherence has been associated with a greater increase in liver enzymes [202]. Thus, the management of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) requires multidisciplinary management, including dieticians, psychologists and clinical nurse specialists, to achieve the best results and adherence [203].  Low-Caloric Diet  The avoidance of overconsumption and reduction of saturated FA (SFA) and free sugar are generally agreed upon components for Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) treatment [63,64]. The question of isocaloric vs. hypocaloric diet, however, is complex.",0247e0fd-4721-4aa9-9d32-dcb41808a6e6
33,methods33," Weight loss is considered a main factor beneficial to Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), as obesity and overweightness are common. In meta-analysis, it has been shown that greater weight loss benefitted the improvement of non-invasive Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)-markers [68,203]. Weight reduction of 7% to 20% leads to significant improvement in paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [94,204,205,206,207]. Rapid weight loss is not recommended due to the risk of increasing hepatic inflammation [63].  In a low-calorie diet study combined with weekly nutritional counselling and aerobic exercise (30–45 min/day at least three times per week) by Nobili et al., which was performed for the duration of a year, a significant reduction in body mass index (BMI) resulted in improvements in fasting glucose, insulin levels, serum lipid levels and aminotransferases and hepatic steatosis in sonography.",57acc758-1657-40a8-bb2f-1ebe1b1b8a0a
34,methods34," The diet featured 25–30 calories/kg/day, and the constitution of macronutrients was 50–60% carbohydrates, 23–30% fat and 15–20% protein. It also included saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (FA), as well as a 4:1 omega-6/omega-3 ratio [94].  These results were confirmed in a longitudinal randomised controlled trial regarding lifestyle. In a Danish study, 117 children with obesity took part in a 10-week ‘weight loss camp’. After the ten weeks, a year of subsequent dietary and exercise interventions followed. The average weight loss was about 7 kg. Only 71 children completed the trial and showed improvement concerning insulin sensitivity, serum aminotransferases and hepatic steatosis. Over the 12-month follow-up period, only 25% of participants maintained the weight reduction [208].  It has been reported that, as long as weight loss is achieved, a hypocaloric diet, either based on low carbohydrates or low fat, results in comparable reductions in intrahepatic fat [176,209].  Mann et al.",9044924b-d2ac-4674-a6ab-3f3b7b32d466
35,methods35," reported that the most commonly used hypocaloric diets with low fat contain 25–30 kcal/kg, 50–60% carbohydrates and 23–30% fat (with one-third saturated fat) for nutritional intervention in paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) studies [68,202,203,210,211].  Low-Carbohydrate Diets/Low-Glycaemic-Index (GI) Diets  In the fructose and low glycemic index/load (FRAGILE) study, a specific diet (low fructose/low glycaemic index/low glycaemic load) was investigated in children and adolescents with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), as well as in healthy individuals. The glycaemic index (GI) is used as a measure of the availability of carbohydrate or the ability of an ingested nutrient to elevate blood glucose. For this purpose, foods are classified as low, medium, or high GI. A GI under 55 is considered low, while 70 and above is considered high GI.",daa10581-bde6-4b6f-abae-667e99b58849
36,methods36," Glucose (GI = 100) is high, while sucrose (GI = 65) is considered medium and fructose (GI = 19) is considered low [212,213,214]  It was demonstrated that the absolute fructose intake was strongly associated with plasma aminotransferase, systolic blood pressure, body fat, insulin resistance and serum cholesterol, independent of weight loss [79].  As previously noted, fructose (like sucrose) appears to be a co-factor, but not sole cause, of paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). As mentioned, evidence supports the fact that there is a significant difference between low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets, as long as both are calorie-restricted diets [215].  Diets low in carbohydrates may be helpful to achieve weight reduction if consumed for a short period (six months). However, weight loss can hardly be maintained after a year by continuing the diet [100].",daf74e35-319e-4693-8be5-28271a34aa17
37,methods37,"  In order to achieve long-term improvement of hepatic steatosis and improvements in IR, a moderately carbohydrate-restricted diet (carbohydrate restricted diet (CRD)) may prove sufficient [76].  This carbohydrate restricted diet (CRD), as presented by Goss et al. for adolescents, aims at minimising the intake of refined carbohydrate sources (e.g., added sugars, high-glycaemic grains and fructose) and to provide ≤25% energy from carbohydrates, 25% energy from protein and ≥50% energy from fat. The intake of saturated fat was limited to <10% total energy/day. They reported that, when compared to a fat-reduced diet, the carbohydrate restricted diet (CRD) resulted in significant reductions in weight, body mass index (BMI), body mass index (BMI) z score, total fat mass and abdominal and leg fat. After the consumption of the carbohydrate restricted diet (CRD), a 32% decrease in the hepatic fat fraction from the average baseline value was achieved. Gross et al.",3dc69e87-59a2-410e-b034-0318d21c4d56
38,methods38," concluded that the dietary recommendation of calorie restriction for weight loss may not be optimal for the reversal of fatty liver in a paediatric population. They concluded that their data suggest that energy restriction may be unnecessary in effectively treating paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), and significant reductions in the hepatic fat fraction in adolescents can occur in a relatively short period of time (8 weeks) by consuming a carbohydrate restricted diet (CRD) [76].  Results are conclusive for low-caloric and low-carbohydrate diets, but are contradictory for isocaloric diets with altered carbohydrate contents and paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) patients. In a collective of 102 children (aged 7–12 years), a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet was comparable to the control group consuming a standard meal portion [149].",6d2185ba-e32f-43ac-a9b2-dff1328c2dc7
39,methods39," The majority of studies obtained through the literature search focused on carbohydrate reduction in the paediatric population, and only a limited number were found on low-glycaemic index-diets. These diets focused on weight reduction in obesity, but not specifically Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)-treatment. Studies comparing low-glycaemic-index diets to a reduced-fat diet in adolescents have shown better improvement of body mass index (BMI) among the low-glycaemic-index groups [149,150,151].  Low-Fat Diet  General recommendations concerning nutritional fat have already been discussed (e.g., avoiding saturated FA (SFA) and consumption of ω-3 PUFAs). The most frequently used hypocaloric diets are of a low-fat content (25–30 kcal/kg and 23–30% fat (with one-third saturated fat)) for nutritional intervention in paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)-studies [68,202,203,210,211].",e815e67a-01c7-4a1f-b73a-e8b55a6c9550
40,methods40,"  When compared with carbohydrate restriction, fat restriction was inferior for the improvement of paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [76].  Mediterranean Diet  The Mediterranean diet (MD) is a diet that has its origins in the states surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. There is no single MD, as all countries have their own variations [216]. The MD consists primarily of vegetables and fresh fruit, olive oil, unrefined cereals and nuts. Fish, white meat and legumes are consumed in moderation. Red meat, processed meats and sweets are rarely consumed. The profile of fatty acids is considered beneficial as there is limited intake of saturated fat and cholesterol and high intake of MUFAs, as well as a balanced ω-3/ω-6 ratio [217,218,219,220].  Due to the beneficial lipid profile, the high content of antioxidants and fibre and low content of simple sugars, the MD is assumed to be anti-inflammatory [163,164,221,222,223].",e1d9f91a-fad3-4493-b595-e19e24cff2eb
41,methods41,"  Therefore, the MD is considered a healthy and simple dietary regimen that is supported by a number of authors to prevent or treat paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [70,71,72,73,224].  Western Diet  The Western diet is hypercaloric and high in fats and simple sugars. This diet is defined by high consumption of fast food, red meat, processed meats, full-fat dairy products, fried potatoes, refined cereals, cakes, biscuits, sweets, soft drinks, sauces and dressings [35]. As a consequence, the postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels are quickly rising. The western diet is associated with increased hepatic de novo-lipogenesis, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, obesity and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [35,139].",0ee783bd-c8d3-4aa6-a65b-50a3b7a66d04
42,methods42,"  This dietary pattern, if present at the age of 14 years, was shown to be associated with a higher prevalence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) at the age 17 (independent of sex, frequency of physical activity and sedentary behaviour and family income) [35,207].  Ketogenic Diet  In recent years, the ketogenic diet has become more popular. It has been reported that it leads to significant weight loss and reduces the hepatic fat fraction, as well as improves metabolic parameters in patients with obesity. A ketogenic diet is low in carbohydrates and, while being high in fat and/or protein, it is hypocaloric. It is not recommended for children with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). Maintaining a ketogenic diet over a longer period may aggravate Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and the progression of systemic glucose intolerance, as demonstrated in animal studies [100,221,225].",8a1b8deb-b3ee-455d-a1e5-190b733fdef4
43,methods43,"  Red Meat  The intake of meat has been associated with glucose intolerance and impaired insulin sensitivity, and may increase the risk of T2D in adults. The metabolic features are also present in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [226,227]. Grilled meat, predominantly red meat, was found to be associated with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [228]. In a study by Shi et al., the consumption of red meat was significantly associated with the prevalence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), while this was not the case for white meat consumption [229,230].  3.3.2. Dietary Patterns  Dietary patterns concerning frequency, unusual mealtimes and amount of nutrients, as well as the selection of diet are crucial. The quality of food (processed foods and low intake of fruit and vegetables) impacts health and the progress of obesity and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [231,232,233,234].",0f96b01a-cf6b-40b3-b72e-25ede4c8b64c
44,methods44," It is known that fast eating, irregular meals with multiple feedings and consuming meals on one’s own are potentially harmful in developing eating disorders, obesity and, as a potential consequence, Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The parents’ function as a positive role model has been discussed [235,236,237,238,239,240,241].  4. Discussion  Dietary recommendations for paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) primarily focus on weight loss and support the same regimen as that for treating paediatric obesity [46,242]. General nutritional recommendations focus on a low-caloric healthy diet (low in carbohydrates, fructose, sucrose, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), saturated fatty acids and trans-fatty acids). Currently, there is no specific recommendation for the type of diet and amount of calorie restriction [64]. Low-caloric diets are investigated in studies as either low in carbohydrate and/or low in fat.",b9be7e8f-be9e-4b6a-9853-07e891ac35b1
45,methods45," The results claimed no difference between low fat and low carbohydrate, as long as it was low caloric [176,209]. As obesity is the main risk factor for Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), caloric restriction is associated with weight reduction, thereby benefitting Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) (via ALT, ultrasound, MRI and liver biopsy) [10]. Not all authors advocate caloric restriction, but mention the importance of high-quality macronutrients. It is difficult to distinguish the specific effect of the macronutrient per se vs. overall caloric restriction in achieving weight loss. While (iso)caloric restriction appears sensible, hypocaloric diets do not [243]. In striving for weight loss, neglecting macronutrients and needed energy may cause health impairments. This may lead to the disturbance of development, puberty, bone density and potentially worsened Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). It has been reported that prolonged hypocaloric diets (e.g.",329e771f-2ab5-4330-bb0b-99c3810556dd
46,methods46,", a ketogenic diet) or rapid weight loss may cause further liver damage [63]. This is also the case with low-carbohydrate diets, as they lead to swift weight loss and improvement of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) over a short period but, if maintained for more than a year, may cause further liver damage [208].  In adults, weight loss of 3–5% can reduce hepatic steatosis and benefit metabolic parameters. non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can be improved or resolved when more than 7% weight loss is achieved [244,245]. In paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), the percentage of weight loss necessary to improve Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has been described to be between 7% and 20% [94,204,205,206,207]. Weight reduction should be gradual and not exceed 500 g/week [75]. Moreover, long-term lifestyle changes lead to improved liver histology [246]. Nobili et al.",63562ca2-b722-4307-a984-03d34a5c74e1
47,methods47," reported that weight loss of >20% over a period of 12 months resulted in improved serum ALT and steatosis in ultrasound. The study did not give any details on the diet used, but provided caloric restriction and exercise advice [207,247]. In a different paediatric study, a mean weight loss of 5 kg (over a 24-month period) resulted in improvements in steatosis, lobular inflammation and liver enzymes [203]. There is no information about the point at which weight loss can be stopped to achieve and maintain hepatic health, or if all patients must aim for normal weight. An important part is that weight loss is not an option for lean patients with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [94,204,205,206,207].  The Western diet is the diet predominantly associated with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). It is characterised by the overconsumption of simple sugars and fats.",455ce0cc-2c7f-49bc-9f06-0886d78c8dd2
48,methods48," Increased energy intake, low-grade systemic inflammation and metabolic changes associated with this diet drive paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [35,139]. There has also been a significant association with red, but not white, meat. This may be due to the fact that white meat contains less (saturated) fat. The dietary pattern of people consuming predominantly red meat may also differ (e.g., eating fewer vegetables) from those who consume white meat, but not red meat [229,230]. The Mediterranean diet (MD) is considered a healthy and simple diet, and has been suggested by a variety of authors to prevent and treat paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). There is no single MD, as all countries around the Mediterranean Sea have their own variety of this diet. The frequency by which certain foods and macronutrients are consumed, as well as the beneficial ratios (e.g., omega fatty acids), are as important as the associated lifestyle.",62e1d264-3fb9-420b-9ee0-599f5cae60a6
49,methods49," Studies generally list the foods, but the lifestyle associated with MD is more relaxed, with more physical work and exercise, as well as having family meals [217,218,219,220,248,249]. No studies for vegetarian or vegan dietary trials/interventions in paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) were found.  The main focus on single macronutrients and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in studies is centred around carbohydrates and especially fructose, sucrose and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). While the majority of consumed calories stem from carbohydrates, the total energy and carbohydrate intake are increased in children with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [86]. There is, however, a focus on free sugars, which should be limited to 10% of the total daily intake and pose a main issue in developing paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [85].",22c974f5-21b8-41af-820e-67338280e29f
50,methods50," Several studies showed that following this recommendation benefits the hepatic fat fraction, and improved metabolic parameters as well as liver enzymes could be achieved. Interestingly, while fructose does not cause Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) by itself, intake in a refined form is strongly associated with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [136,137]. When fructose is consumed in its natural form (e.g., fruit), its constituents (flavanols, epicatechin, ascorbate and other antioxidants) may antagonise the negative effects of fructose [115,116]. A relevant issue is the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and energy drinks that contain large amounts of sucrose and high-fructose-corn syrup [105]. In studies, even a several-day-long reduction of fructose led to an improvement in liver health [131,135]. In adults, a single 360 mL/d threshold of soft drink has been reported for metabolic syndrome [147,148].",a5490771-83de-4861-933b-c9360b5df833
51,methods51," For Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and especially hepatic fibrosis, a dose-dependent association with soft drink consumption exists. In view of this, a significant reduction in fructose, sucrose and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in processed foods, beverages and a general ban on high-fructose corn syrup are advised [38,87,92,137,145,146,250]. The role of fructose in the intestinal microbiome and gut barrier function remains under debate [120,122].  There is an association between the amount of fat consumed and increased Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)-risk, but also of the quality of fat. Saturated fatty acids should be avoided in general. As 90% of ingested fat consists of triglycerides (the rest being phospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol and the lipophile vitamins A, D, E and K), the main focus should lie on these.",57f8e65f-d216-4ed6-94f8-778279bcca47
52,methods52," In patients’ perception, the role of nutritional cholesterol in metabolic disorders and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) seems overestimated, as only a fraction of ingested cholesterol is absorbed. Patient education should, therefore, aim at MUFAs and PUFAs, as well as the total fat amount and ω-3/ω-6 ratio. Evidence supports the consumption of a diet rich in ω-3-fatty-acids, while ω-6-fatty acids and SLCFAs should be avoided due to their associations with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). This further advocates the Mediterranean diet as a therapeutic diet of choice for paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [46,156,157]. Fat and carbohydrates (especially fructose) exert an additive effect in causing Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in the paediatric population [128,139].  There are limited data on protein and paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and the results are controversial.",f8ed2a58-5026-4dcc-a4e4-eb5d6664da8a
53,methods53," Although there are reports of significantly higher intake of protein in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), there is also evidence that diets low in protein are associated with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). A possible explanation for the higher intake is that a main source of protein is (red) meat, which is also richer in fat and typically associated with a Western diet. Dietary protein is linked to inflammatory processes, influencing the gut microbiome and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) progression. The depletion of protein, on the other hand, may lead to the reduction of muscle mass, inducing gluconeogenesis via arginine from the muscle and thus lowering the capability for glucose resorption and disturbing the metabolic equilibrium [188,189,190,191], while others found no difference [77,192].  5. Conclusions  There are key roles of nutrition and especially macronutrients in the pathogenesis of paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).",df893707-8d78-4845-a971-0022dbfb3834
54,methods54," Fructose, sucrose, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids and ω-6 fatty acids are strongly associated with driving paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [142,171,186,251,252]. On the other hand, fibre, low-glycaemic-index diets, MUFAs and ω-3 fatty acids are beneficial in the prevention and treatment of paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [253,254,255,256]. There is no evidence supporting children with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and children with obesity requiring a different nutritional regimen compared with each other and healthy, lean children. Weight normalisation benefits both obesity and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). As a consequence, the same dietary advice is given to children with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) as to children with obesity. Unfortunately, achieving and maintaining weight loss is very difficult (<10% success over a period of 2 years intervention) [257].",2a939971-4c8b-4595-83bb-3119e1a1db78
55,methods55," The best results for childhood weight loss have been achieved by multi-disciplinarity family-based behavioural treatment [43]. In meta-analyses, no single diet has been superior in treating paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [68]. However, the composition of macronutrients in the Mediterranean diet (MD) and certain studies support the MD as suitable for preventing and treating Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [70,71,72,73]. The established recommendations of avoiding saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, simple sugars (fructose, sucrose and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)) and a high-caloric Western Diet are supported by the literature [258]. Currently, the optimal proportions of total macronutrients (carbohydrate, fat and protein) in the diet of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)-patients are unknown [74]. The role of dietary protein in paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) remains contradictory [156,193,194].",2ecba037-98c1-44a7-a928-afb5547ea113
56,methods56," In addition, at the moment, there are no formal recommendations for the treatment of lean Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [64,245]. Table 5 lists the current recommendations as provided by literature research.  More efforts in preventing paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) by dietary education and the avoidance of harmful macronutrients need to be undertaken. It is clear that combining dietary intervention with physical activity is superior to dietary intervention alone. Further studies on the role of macronutrients and optimal dietary intervention in paediatric Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) are needed [259,260,261].
