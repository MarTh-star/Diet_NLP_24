0,background0,"Low plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C) and high plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations are two diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome (MetS) [1]. Over-secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein-apolipoproteinB (VLDL-apoB) and accelerated clearance of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles appear to be the primary mechanisms sustaining the high TG/low high density lipoprotein (HDL) phenotype in MetS [2].  Previous studies have demonstrated that when body weight is maintained constant, diets low in saturated fat and high in carbohydrates (carbohydrates (CHO)) have high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C lowering and TG raising effects [3].",a9509f17-e151-471d-9007-822970fc1762
1,background1," On the other hand, several epidemiological studies have shown that adherence to Mediterranean type diet (MedDiet), which is characterized among other factors by a high consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) and low intake of saturated and trans fat, is associated with a reduced risk of overall mortality and death from cardiovascular disease [4]. However, the extent to which this is attributable to beneficial changes in high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations and function with MedDiet is unknown. A recent meta-analysis of 50 studies revealed that adherence to the MedDiet was associated with significant reductions in body weight and waist circumference [5]. Thus, it is not clear if the favorable increase in plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentrations often seen with MedDiet is due to differences in diet composition per se or to concurrent reduction in body weight as well.",024735c2-a543-446a-8249-5b2bdda786ae
2,background2," A better understanding of how high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism is modified in response to MedDiet, per se, is crucial to help identify optimal dietary interventions for low high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentration management in high-risk individuals.  The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the MedDiet, in the absence of weight change, on apolipoprotein (apo) A-I kinetics in men with MetS. We hypothesized that in contrast to prior data having documented the combined effect of the MedDiet and weight loss, short-term consumption of a traditional MedDiet in the absence of weight loss has no impact on the catabolic rate of apoA-I and thus on plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentrations.

3,methods0,"Population and study design Details of the study design have been previously described [6]. Briefly, 26 men (18 to 65 years) diagnosed with the MetS (NCEP-ATP III [1]), and who did not smoke, with no history of coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) or type 2 diabetes, and not using lipid-lowering or anti-hypertensive medication were recruited for the study. For inclusion in the study, men also had to have a stable weight for at least 6 months prior to the start of the study, not use vitamin supplements or natural health products, and have no aversion to specific components of the MedDiet. Study procedures were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Laval University and written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to be enrolled in the study.  Isoenergetic experimental diets Participants’ diet was first standardized to a control diet reflecting current averages in macronutrient intake in North American men [7].",180df431-c408-4170-aabe-1a6cc0066b0f
4,methods1," Food was provided in isoenergetic conditions over a 5-week period to maintain body weight constant. This controlled feeding period was included in the protocol to minimize inter-individual variations attributed to each participant’s usual diet. Participants were then provided with a MedDiet (5 weeks) that was formulated to be concordant with characteristics of the traditional Mediterranean eating pattern again in isoenergetic conditions to maintain body weight constant [8]. Seven-day menus and daily servings of various food categories for the control diet and the MedDiet were developed for the study and have been described previously [6].

Kinetic protocol All participants underwent a kinetic study during the last week of the control diet and the MedDiet. On each occasions after a 12-h fast, participants received a single i.v. bolus of [5,5,5-2H3] L-leucine (11 mg/kg) and fasting blood samples (20 mL) were collected at predetermined time points over a 96 hours period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h). Additional twelve-hour fasting blood samples were collected in the morning of the next 4 subsequent days (24, 48, 72, 96 h).

7,methods5,"  Plasma lipids and lipoproteins assessment Plasma lipids were measured enzymatically on a Roche/Hitachi Modular using Roche Diagnostics reagents (Roche diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) according to standardized procedures [9]. The cholesterol and triglyceride content of the high density lipoprotein (HDL)2 and high density lipoprotein (HDL)3 subfractions was determined after sequential precipitation with dextran sulfate as previously described [10]. Plasma apoA-I concentrations were measured by nephelometry (Dade Behring, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Fasting blood glucose concentrations were determined by the hexokinase-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase method [11] and fasting insulin concentrations by radioimmunoassay [12].  Quantification and isotopic enrichment of apolipoprotein A-I ApoA-I in the d < 1.25 g/ml plasma fraction was obtained by ultracentrifugation using a Beckman 50.4ti Rotor.

8,methods6," Following a cysteamine treatment for 4 h at 37°C, samples were delipidated according to standardized procedures [13]. ApoA-I was isolated by isoelectric focusing (isoelectric focusing (IEF)) on a polyacrylamide-urea gels and bands were excised. Bands containing apoA-I were then hydrolysed for 24 hours at 110°C using 6 N HCl, dried and derivatized. The isotopic enrichment (%) was determined by a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS; GC 6890 N, MS 5973 N, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).  Kinetic modeling ApoA-I fractional catabolic rate (fractional catabolic rate (FCR)) was determined by multicompartmental modeling of the isotopic enrichment data over time using the SAAM II software (University of Washington, Department of Bioengineering, Seattle, WA).

Fractional catabolic rate (pools/day) of plasma apoA-I was obtained from the best fit of isotopic enrichment of apoA-I over time to the model. Pool size (PS) of apoA-I was estimated by multiplying plasma apoA-I concentrations by plasma volume (estimated at 0.045 l/kg body weight) [14]. The production rate (PR in mg/kg/d) of apoA-I was calculated by multiplying the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) by the PS of apoA-I, and correcting for body weight.

Consumption of the MedDiet had no impact on plasma apoA-I concentrations among responders but significantly reduced apoA-I PR and apoB concentrations compared with the control diet (both P < 0.05).

17,discussion0,"Men with MetS consumed a pre-determined MedDiet under carefully controlled isoenergetic feeding conditions, after standardization of the participants’ diet on a control diet to minimize inter-individual variations in baseline apoA-I kinetics. We showed that 4–5 week short-term consumption of a MedDiet significantly reduced plasma apoA-I concentrations and pool size, but had no impact on average on plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentrations. This is at odds with data from studies having shown that adherence to MedDiet principles was associated with improvements in high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentrations [15,16]. However, adherence to MedDiet has also been associated with significantly lower body weight [15,16], which is likely to have confounded the effect of the diet on high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentrations [17,18].",4a3c6bff-8df8-4ce1-b612-9b1661ff1cff
18,discussion1," Although consumption of the MedDiet had no impact on mean apoA-I fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and plasma VLDL-TG concentrations, the individual high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C response to MedDiet in men with MetS appeared to be primarily determined by how apoA-I fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and VLDL-TG concentrations were modified by the diet in each individual.  Consumption of the MedDiet vs. the control diet implied several changes in diet composition, including greater intakes of fibers, alcohol and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and lower intakes of trans fatty acids (trans fatty acids (TFA)) and SFA. Kinetic studies have shown that total dietary fat and/or SFA are associated with apoA-I PR (positively) and apoA-I fractional catabolic rate (FCR) (negatively) [19,20]. A high monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) diet consumed ad libitum reduced apoA-I PS with no significant change in apoA-I PR and fractional catabolic rate (FCR) [21].",9d4eadbd-71ba-475e-b3fb-4469eda707e3
19,discussion2," Consumption of trans fat has been shown to increase apoA-I fractional catabolic rate (FCR) relative to a SFA rich diet in hypercholesterolemic women [22]. Water-soluble fibers have been shown to reduce LDL-C without affecting high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentrations [23]. Kinetic studies indicated that alcohol consumption increases plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C and apoA-I concentrations mainly by increasing the PR of apoA-I [24,25]. Thus, variations in apoA-I kinetics in response to MedDiet in the present study must be interpreted in light of all of these individual nutrient-specific effects combined together. We hypothesize that the apparent reduction in apoA-I PR is partly attributable to the reduced amount of dietary SFA (−6.3%) in MedDiet vs. the control diet. Indeed, restricting dietary total fat and SFA has been shown to reduce hepatic apoA-I mRNA expression in livers of Cebus monkeys [20,26].",a5186e41-de9b-40e5-a7e8-497b32580e22
20,discussion3," The significant reduction in LDL-C and apoB concentrations with MedDiet [6] may also have contributed to lowering apoA-I PR. Indeed, apoA-I PR has been positively correlated with plasma LDL-C and LDL-apoB concentrations [27], suggesting less need for reverse cholesterol transport when the plasma LDL-C pool is reduced. It appears that the impact of increasing alcohol intake as part of the MedDiet on raising apoA-I PR did not fully compensate for these effects.  Men with MetS in the present study were characterized by an elevated apoA-I fractional catabolic rate (FCR) after the control diet (0.32 pool/day), and these figures are comparable with those from a previous kinetic study in which dyslipidemic subjects with MetS also had higher apoA-I fractional catabolic rate (FCR) compared with controls (0.30 vs. 0.20 pool/day) [28].",d1a701c8-7ef1-4fbb-97f1-989d5e573820
21,discussion4," Two other groups have shown that low high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C and apoA-I concentrations in overweight/obese subjects with insulin resistance were mainly accounted for by an apoA-I hypercatabolism [29,30]. Our results showed that the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C response to MedDiet was highly heterogeneous. Participants among whom high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C increased with MedDiet showed greater reductions in apoA-I clearance rates and in plasma apoB and VLDL-TG concentrations than those among whom high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentrations were reduced with MedDiet. Moreover, correlation analysis showed that individual variations in the catabolism of apoA-I and in VLDL-TG concentrations were the strongest correlates of individual changes in high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentrations with MedDiet.",8b75d051-b4d6-40d9-82ce-fddbe2b1d2ec
22,discussion5," Our data reaffirm that even in the context of significant dietary changes, the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of apoA-I remains the key determinant of the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C and apoA-I response to MedDiet among men with MetS [2]. Indeed, although plasma apoA-I concentrations may be partly determined by the PR of apoA-I, change in the PR of apoA-I with MedDiet was not a significant correlate of concurrent variations in plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C and apoA-I in our study.  Several previous studies have shown that TG concentrations correlate positively with the catabolism of apoA-I [31,32]. Our data are consistent with that concept. Reduction in VLDL-TG decreases the hetero-exchange of neutral lipids by CETP leading to less TG-enriched high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles [33]. TG-poor high density lipoprotein (HDL) have been shown to be more stable and consequently, cleared less rapidly from the circulation [34].",c9a8c3ec-f312-48e2-9625-790e4952c23e
23,discussion6," We hypothesize that the increase in alcohol consumption with the MedDiet may be partly responsible for the heterogeneous TG response in these subjects with MetS. Indeed, a recent study has shown that heavy alcohol consumption can lead to either high or low concentrations of VLDL-TG [35]. Finally, low-carbohydrate/high-fat diets have high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C raising and TG lowering effects compared with high-carbohydrate/low-fat diets [36]. It is possible that the relatively high carbohydrate content of the MedDiet in our study may have attenuated its impact on plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentrations. Indeed, a high fat MedDiet supplemented with nuts have been shown to reduce TG and increase high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentrations compared with a low fat diet [37].  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study having documented the impact of the MedDiet on apoA-I kinetic in men with MetS.",d08968c6-33d2-4f02-9aec-9147b5d47d89
24,discussion7," The carefully controlled feeding feature of the present study, the high compliance to the pre-determined diets and the relatively large number of participants considering a kinetic study are important strengths that need to be emphasized. Limitations of the current study pertain to the fact that there was no control group independent of the intervention and that participants were not randomized to the two experimental diets in this fixed sequence study. However, standardization of the baseline diet with a control North American diet prior to consuming the MedDiet allowed us to minimize inter-individual variations in baseline apoA-I kinetics and each participant acts as their own control. The sort-term duration of the study precludes any formal interpretation regarding longer term effects of MedDiet on high density lipoprotein (HDL) and apoA-I kinetics.",1bd22521-7901-474d-a628-566dc09ffc28
25,discussion8," Although MedDiet had no impact on high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C, some functions of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles might still be beneficially altered by the diet, but this remained to be investigated.  Conclusions Data from this controlled feeding study suggest that the heterogeneous high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C response to a traditional MedDiet in men with MetS, independent of weight change, appears to be primarily determined by individual responses in apoA-I fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and TG concentrations. The reduction in apoA-I PR with MedDiet apparently has no incidence on the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C response to the diet and is probably due to the reduced amount of SFA and the concurrent reduction in LDL-C concentrations.",05e8c4bc-6cb9-4bf8-8411-a0865850d0df
