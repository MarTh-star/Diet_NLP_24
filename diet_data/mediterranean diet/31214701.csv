0,background0," The prevalence of insomnia at the beginning of pregnancy is around 40%, reaching over 60% in the third trimester of pregnancy [1–4]. Insomnia is associated with an increase of gestational diabetes mellitus (gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)), depression in pregnancy and postpartum, arterial hypertension and preeclampsia as a result of the increase in cytokine levels derived from sleep deprivation [5]. Insomnia is also involved in unplanned caesarean sections, prolonged labour, premature placental abruption, delayed intrauterine growth and prematurity [6].  It has been documented that practice of physical activity (PA) prevents the onset of insomnia in adults [7], postmenopausal women [8] and pregnant women [9]. In addition, the practice of regular PA (> 150 min/week) also increases the quality of sleep in adults [10] and in pregnancy [11]. However, only 20.3–30% of pregnant women are active [12, 13].",8d6ea2ed-215d-453c-8f8b-523292c12f97
1,background1," In fact, pregnant women spend more than 50% of their time in sedentary activities [14]. To make an objective assessment of this, a woman who counts less than 5000 steps/day on average could be considered sedentary [15].  Walking is one of the recommended activities in the guidelines of PA in pregnant women in Canada, Japan, Norway and Spain and the most carried out during pregnancy [16, 17]. However, the number of steps/days counted in the first trimester of pregnancy does not exceed 5000 steps [18], which is half of those recommended (10,000-11,000) [19] and decreases as the gestation progresses [18]. Walking during pregnancy regulates, prevents or delays the increase in blood pressure and cholesterol in healthy women [20], decreases the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus [21] and improves glycaemic control of pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [22].",51cbc9cc-ab0e-4dc1-a7f7-532362f7ee8c
2,background2," Moreover, improves cardiorespiratory capacity [23], decreases stress and anxiety and improves sleep quality [24], increases quality of life [25] and reduces weight gain during pregnancy [26].  The pedometer is a cost-effective tool that increases the motivation to walk and increase the number of steps per day by 2000 to 2500 [27] compared to those who do not use it. The effectiveness of the pedometer is greater when establishing a goal to achieve [28]. Different studies carried out in pregnant women show that when all the participants of the study use a pedometer, the establishment of a goal of steps to be reached per day (10,000-11,000) increases the mood and number of steps walked by the person receiving such information [26, 29–33].  Some effects evaluated with the use of pedometers in pregnant women are the increase of mood [34], the decrease in weight gain in obese pregnant women [26, 30], the decrease in the incidence of preeclampsia [35] and the reduction of back pain [36].",8ea64232-80d3-420a-9a9a-74daea828290
3,background3," However, there are no previous studies that analyse whether an intervention aimed at promoting PA in pregnant women, based on walking, helps to prevent insomnia that appears towards the end of pregnancy and how it could have an impact on the quality of life related to health and sleep quality as pregnancy progresses.  Our hypothesis is that a program to promote walking in the first half of pregnancy through the use of a pedometer and through the health pre-registration of a goal to be achieved –'10,000–11,000 steps a day’– prevents the appearance of insomnia in the third trimester of pregnancy, increases the quality of sleep and improves the quality of life of pregnant women.  Aim  The main objective of this RCT is to determine the effect of a program aimed at promoting physical activity in pregnant women based on walking during pregnancy in the prevention of sleep hygiene disorders and improvement of the quality of life in the third trimester of pregnancy.",279d6c67-90b2-431a-a630-ddf3a3f17aca

10,background10," 2) Alpha error: 5%; 3) Power of the study: 80%; 4) Comparison of I1 vs I2: from the previous premises, 120 women would be needed in each arm; Comparison of I1 vs C: from the previous premises, and taking as reference the 120 women of the I1 arm required for the previous comparison, 25 women in the C arm would be required.  A pilot of the previous design was carried out with 72 women not included in this study: 24 women in each arm of the study, interviewed twice (12th and 20th GW), during the months of February to May 2018. The recruitment period was 3 months. To select a total of 265 women, 1 year and 7 months would be required (considering holiday periods and Covid-19). We estimate 20–30% of losses in second and third interviews (due to neonatal loss or abandonment of the study).  Randomization of participants and concealment  The Stata Ralloc program will generate a randomization sequence by blocks of n = 9 and 3 arms per block (A, B and C).",a02155b8-09c0-4eff-9c5b-2fe2f55ea3af

The sequence will be generated by the data analysts and kept in the monitoring centre, remaining at all times hidden to those clinicians responsible for the enrolment of pregnant women. Allocation sequence will be concealed until women are assigned to interventions by the research staff/interviewer. This way, the follow-up centre will be contacted each time the interviewer has a pregnant woman, so that they are informed of the arm to which she will be assigned.  There will be concealment for the people in charge of carrying out the evaluation and analysis of the data because they will manage the database without personal women information or knowledge about the group intervention, where women will be allocated.",d72c1228-b135-420d-9d9f-3d67a96be109
