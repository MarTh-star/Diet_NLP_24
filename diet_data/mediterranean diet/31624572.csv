0,background0,"The pandemic emergency linked to the spread of the new coronavirus disease COVID-19, led the Italian Government to adopt extreme measures of social distancing, which paralyzed the economy, the society and the daily life of thousands of people (1). The restrictive rules involved the whole population, with particular emphasis on older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions, since these individuals are extremely at risk of developing a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)), hospitalization, and death. Therefore, the indications contained in the DPCM of the 8th March 2020, made an “express recommendation to all people who are elderly or suffering from chronic or multi-morbid diseases […] to avoid leaving their home out of cases of strict need (2).”  COVID-19 can have direct and indirect effects on physical and mental health of the aged people.",cb721271-7057-46c8-b3f1-63e4b1854640
1,background1," The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19 may affect central and peripheral nervous system (3, 4), having potential effects on the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases (5). Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 may also affect the cells of the intestinal mucosa, triggering intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis and potentially causing short and long-term alterations of gut microbiota, which have demonstrated strong associations with, neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases (6, 7).  In order to reduce the spread of infection and optimize the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, some aspects of health management were modified: medical visits, non-urgent surgery and rehabilitative interventions were suspended, reduced, or post-poned; part of the visits were conducted by telephone or with the aid of telematic instruments.",e44c1176-ca75-4237-98ab-2b513910bd8a
2,background2," These changes may affect the management of elderly patients, who might encounter difficulties related to the modification of their routines and/or to the use of tools with which they are not familiar, and of patients with multiple comorbidities, who need integrated and continuous care, periodic symptoms monitoring, and readjustment of drug treatments. Moreover, elderly people and patients with multimorbidity may not access the medical visits for fear of being infected by COVID-19.  The lockdown measures in Italy led also to the closure of the day centers, offices of voluntary associations, churches, parishes, gyms, elderly universities, and other meeting places for seniors. Social disconnection is a risk factor for incident dementia, determining an increased risk of depression and anxiety for elderly people (8).",4e242c75-af45-4af3-93c8-403537bebfac
3,background3," Retrospective studies on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 observed an increase in suicide rates between seniors during the epidemic period (9) and an online survey conducted last February in the regions of south-western China by Lei et al. (10), found that the inhabitants of the areas subjected to quarantine for COVID-19 showed almost double prevalence of depression and anxiety compared to the residents of the regions where isolation measures were not applied. Depression, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric symptoms represent risk factors for the conversion to dementia (11, 12); these symptoms worsen the quality of life of patients, accelerate the progression of the disease and lead to institutionalization and to an increase of health costs (13).",e865f04f-9002-4f5e-8c21-4cbefbdbd584
4,background4," Furthermore, lockdown could affect disproportionately the mental health of old people, whom relatives contracted COVID-19, people who live alone and whose only social contacts take place outside home, and people who do not have close relatives or friends and rely on the support of voluntary services or social assistance (14).  It is also important to note that changes in lifestyles, physical activity, and nutritional habits have a significant impact on cardiovascular risk factors (15), that are important predictors of dementia. In fact, it has been estimated that about a third of Alzheimer's disease cases (AD)—the most common form of neurodegenerative disease—is attributable to modifiable risk factors, as low education, smoking, physical inactivity, presence of hypertension, obesity, diabetes, depression (16, 17).",f653c9fd-7296-45c2-a271-23f5c1e0ce02
5,background5," Modifiable risk factors play also an important role in the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia (11, 18), therefore, any COVID-19 related changes in lifestyle might affect the progression of cognitive impairment.  Eating habits may change during quarantine due to reduced availability of products, restrictions on access to stores (as, for example, the need to queue outside every store to do groceries), the fear of the possible lack of food which leads to the purchase and the consumption of packaged and preserved food, the reduced intake of fresh foods and the transition to unhealthy foods, such as snacks, and hunger-breakers—which may lead to a weight gain and to a reduced intake of antioxidants (15).  Also a decrease in the amount of time spent being physically active might have negative consequence on cognition and mental health.

A few days of sedentary life are enough to induce muscular loss, damage to neuromuscular junction and fibers' denervation (neuromuscular integrity is strictly binded to mitochondrial function), insulin resistance, reduction in aerobic capacity, fat deposition and low-grade systemic inflammation. Indeed, mechanisms involving oxidative processes, neuroinflammation and apoptosis have long been studied under different neurological conditions, as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) and Huntington's disease (HD).",7840594b-a265-4b39-b835-1f38fd19cf30
7,background7," Inflammatory processes are known to be closely linked to depression, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus (DM), and obesity, small vessels' diseases and atherosclerosis, which are the main risk factors for the main cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, including AD (20).  A recently published study reported associations between changes in healthy behaviors and psychological distress in Australian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: particularly, the more important were the negative changes in physical activity, sleep, smoking and alcohol consumption, the higher was the increasing in depression, anxiety and distress scores (21). No study, until today, inquired associations between changes in lifestyle and mental health issues in older adults at increased risk of dementia.",420120ca-0e20-4aa0-b966-1c105c20234c

Free psychological support services were also provided including the National toll-free number 800.833.833, to meet psychological needs of people under quarantine and reduce the mental distress associated with COVID-19 (26). However, aged people, and in particular those who suffer from cognitive decline, may not have the necessary mental abilities to access these services.  Until today, there are only few studies who evaluated the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and of the quarantine measure on the psychological well-being, and lifestyles of older people and, in particular, of those at risk of cognitive decline.",ecd3f52e-aefb-4941-9f0a-570569853b2d

On the other hand, these researches enrolled seniors without cognitive impairment. It was observed that the COVID-19 related confinement aggravated the behavioral and psychological symptoms of community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) or mild dementia, with agitation, apathy, and aberrant motor activity being the most affected symptoms (29, 30). A phone-based survey conducted by Goodman-Casanova et al.

However, this latter did not assess mental health using validated scales and did not investigate whether there were any associations between lifestyle changes and negative experiences.  The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures on the mental health and the lifestyles of older people at risk of dementia. In detail, we aimed to explore and analyse: (1) the reported changes in physical activity, leisure activities, smoking habits, caffeine and alcohol intake, eating behaviors, and in particular adherence to the MD during lockdown; (2) the presence of mental health issues, and in particular of depression, anxiety and apathy, according to validates scales.",4159b523-eca7-41dd-add3-6333583ed102

(2) Cognitive status was assessed through a phone version of the Mini Mental State Examination (Itel-MMSE) (35). Itel-MMSE is a validated Italian tool which shows strong correlations with paper-and-pencil MMSE (r = 0.85 in the whole sample and r = 0.77 in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects) (36) and it is predictive of domain-specific cognitive test performances (37).",1c32f538-68f5-478a-854b-91919847037f

A point is assigned to the presence of each of these 5 items, resulting in a global GDS-5 score ranging from 0 to 5, with a cut-off score of 2.  The 18 questions of Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) inquire 3 domains of apathy (decrease in goal-directed behaviors, reduction of goal-related thoughts, emotional indifference).

Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert Scale (0 = not at all to 3 = nearly every day). A cut-off score of 10 provides the best sensitivity and specificity for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) diagnosis.    Other questions included the impact of information about COVID-19 on their feelings; having felt the need to consult freely available psychological services; having contacted the freely available psychological services; and whether they actually did.  (6) Physical activity was assessed with a modified version of the “International Physical Activity Questionnaire—short form” (IPAQ-SF) (44).,5dea439f-39d0-4b59-975f-af5040b5cfbb

The time spent in each activity level can be converted into Metabolic Equivalent of Task (Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET)) values, to obtain an index of the amount of the individual's total energy expenditure. A cut-point of 600 Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET)/week, roughly corresponding to 150 min of moderate intensity activity, was adopted to classify participants as physically active/inactive. Participants were asked to evaluate their physical activity levels via IPAQ during the last week before the phone call and during the last week before the lockdown.",f82f5375-16b0-4fd1-95de-88bfdb5f14c0

53,discussion2," Changes toward increased sedentary lifestyle, overweight, unhealthy diet and lower engagement in non-passive recreational activities can increase the risk of dementia, since these variables have been consistently associated in middle age with a subsequent increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (16). An association, although weaker and non-invariable, also exists with an increased risk of dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (11, 18) and recent evidence indicate that poor social interactions, small social networks, and low level of physical activity are correlated with depressive symptoms in community-dwelling seniors with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (47).

54,discussion3,"  If it is true that the changes implied by the quarantine may be temporary and their effects lower compared to long-lasting lifestyles, it is equally conceivable that, at the end of the lockdown phase, many people will not return to their pre-pandemic “normal routine.” Unhealthy lifestyles adopted during lockdown could be maintained despite the reopening—for example, it is possible that people who before the lockdown used to go to the gym to exercise and who during quarantine stopped their training, will not start again, because of the fear of contagion or other reasons—similarly to what reported about MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), where it was observed that psychological difficulties associated to quarantine persisted for 4–6 months beyond the end of the restrictions in almost half of the people (48). Therefore, the use of quarantine as a measure of public health must consider the potential acute and chronic psychological effects of this procedure.",26e206b2-6206-48bc-bf0c-c0f113aa66b6
55,discussion4," In addition, the early assessment of the consequences of this measure on health conditions of the population at risk of dementia and the study of the strategies to limit this effect are particularly important (30).  Eighteen seniors of our sample (14.29%) were smokers. A third of them declared having smoked a higher number of cigarettes than before, since the beginning of the quarantine, while only 2 reported having smoked less. Moreover, most of our participants who, in the pre-quarantine were physically active, reduced time spent engaging in physical activity. Our results are in agreement with a recent web-based cross-sectional study (49) which showed an increased number of cigarettes per day among those who were smokers, and are in disagreement with those from a recent survey conducted by Di Renzo et al.",cc0b6eb9-82a5-4d96-81f8-dea9c9a9ca9d
56,discussion5," (50) that showed reduced smoking habits and increased physical activity after the COVID-19 lockdown in a high proportion of Italian responders: authors hypothesized that their this results might be due to the fear, in Italians, of increased risk of respiratory distress and mortality from COVID-19 associated with smoke (51). Their sample was mainly composed of younger respondents without cognitive impairment. It has been hypothesized that people with cognitive decline may not be fully aware of the risks associated with the pandemic, and therefore less likely to adopt coping strategies. On the other hand, the proportion of smokers between participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in our sample is largely overlapping, so our results our results cannot be solely attributable to a lack of risk awareness. It is possible that the observed differences with respect to that survey are attributable to age differences in risk perceptions.",c173fa88-cc85-4dbe-ae74-69638f29775f
57,discussion6," Accordingly, the recent survey of Bruine de Bruin (28) observed that the fear of contracting the virus or of health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic appears to decrease with increasing age.  Nevertheless, also a consistent part of our participants still implemented coping strategies such as increasing physical activity levels, improving their nutritional style, engaging in cognitively stimulating or productive activities, reducing smoking. Moreover, different from Di Renzo et al. (50), only 14.89% of our respondents reported greater tendency to eat unhealthy after the lockdown (less than half compared to 35.08% of their sample). However, this higher percentage may again reflect age differences: in fact, they reported higher appetite increase in younger people while our sample is made up of seniors ≥ 60 years of age.",22f715d4-d571-46fc-b1aa-5ef9bdc60f30
58,discussion7," It has been shown that the adoption of healthy behaviors during quarantine may be useful to fight against the mental and physical consequences of COVID-19 quarantine, especially in older people. Our study did not reveal any association between lifestyle factors and GDS-5, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 scores o Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) in our sample. Therefore, at least in the short term, maintaining an active lifestyle seems not to be protective against cognitive decline, depression or anxiety. However, we must consider the cross sectional nature of our study, which is a limitation that does not allow us to draw any definitive conclusions. It is therefore plausible that in the long term the seniors who engaged in active lifestyles will have a slower progression of their cognitive decline and a lesser probability that their mental health status will worsen.

The 19.84% of our interviewees had a GDS-5 score indicative of depressive symptoms. Our results, showing a significant association between depression and living alone or having a poor relationship with the cohabitants, are in contrast with a recent cross-sectional study based on a national online survey in Spain conducted by García-Fernandez et al. (27) which did not show any relationship between loneliness and increase of depression in older adults.",ef8e2764-2bbd-48ad-9261-951ef6010eae
60,discussion9," However, our results are consistent with another study conducted by phone-interviewing elders with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (31) and with the hypothesis that quarantine period affects mental health of older people who live alone and whose only social contacts take place outside home (14). Therefore, our results suggest that particular attention should be placed on social isolation for older people living alone or having bad relationships with family-members.  In our study, 30.16% reported feeling often irritated, nervous and getting angry easily. The scores obtained in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7, showed that 37.30% of the participants scored ≥ 5 (mild anxiety) and 9.52% obtained scores indicative of clinically significant anxiety. These results are consistent with the study by Bruine de Bruin et al. (28).",9001c805-93f1-4b50-bc6e-458e38b56d37
61,discussion10," We found a significant association between anxiety and perceiving subjective cognitive decline (SCD): this could mean that people with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are more concerned about their cognitive status and their health, showing increased awareness. Increased anxiety is also associated with the presence of flu symptoms: considering their higher vulnerability, older people perceive the risk of contracting the virus and the manifestation of flu or COVID-19 symptoms, e.g., fever or cold, which inevitably increases the concern of a probable contagion. On the other hand, it is equally possible that anxious people are overly focused on their symptoms and emphasize signs of cognitive decline that are part of normal aging and physical symptoms of negligible severity. In fact, none of our participants had such severe flu or respiratory symptoms that they required hospitalization or performing the oropharyngeal swab.",fd0dcd11-b6a1-4193-afbe-ef1f219537df
62,discussion11," In addition, we found an association between anxiety and reduced productive leisure activities: we hypothesized that, probably, these people could not get away from their worries. However, it is also possible that the impossibility of dedicating to some productive activities, which were carried out outside the home before the lockdown, led to greater levels of anxiety. Again, the cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow us to verify any causal associations.  In a recent study, Beatriz Lara et al.

We found that 14.29% of the participants reported having lost interest in many of their activities, hobbies, or friends/relatives since the beginning of the quarantine; while 9.52% participants were categorized as apathetic according to Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Univariate analyses revealed a significant association between apathy and no adherence to Mediterranean Diet, decrease of time in productive leisure activities, living alone or having a poor relation with relatives, however these associations lost significance in the multiple model.",787f6aa4-eb55-44e5-87ba-2e83a1a9f93d

Two seniors instead turned to their GP, who prescribed pharmacological treatments.",493c9820-e4b9-4d9c-97d7-abbc361c1651
65,discussion14," This has possible implications regarding the strategies adopted at the public level to counteract the possible psycho-emotional consequences of the pandemic in elderly people at risk of dementia: although not in any way conclusive, the data available to us indicate that seniors with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective cognitive decline (SCD) tend to not think about and to not resort to call center services or unknown professionals in case of emotional distress, perhaps because they do not remember having this opportunity, perhaps because they prefer to turn to their known and trusted physicians or perhaps because they find themselves uncomfortable talking about their difficulties by phone instead of through a face-to-face conversation. In anticipation of a possible second wave of COVID-19 it would be advisable to strengthen the capacity of GP offices to take care of the psychological well-being of elderly patients.",4739b2b3-ad7d-4e83-950c-b7b83ea79512
66,discussion15,"  Limits Beyond the cross-sectional nature of the study and the limited sample size, that warrants making any conclusive inference, participants were recruited among elderly that were included in a prevention programme, whose aim was reducing the risk to develop dementia, while we do not have any data about elderly who were not interested in taking part in the study. Moreover, almost a third of selected did not participate to the phone interview. Therefore, we should not overlook the presence of a potential selection bias. Furthermore, our sample includes only people with subjective or objective cognitive decline, not considering healthy elderly subjects who are aware to have no difficulties or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects not completely aware of their difficulties. For this reasons, our data may not be representative of over-60 population.",03ce10be-953b-4cff-b3d8-44418b173c68
67,discussion16," However, GR-2013-02356043 recruited a more representative community-based sample of general population than a clinical sample of people pertaining to clinics or departments to assess cognitive disorders.  Another major limitation of our study is that we obtained data through telephone interviews with people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who might present memory or judgment deficits that do not make them reliable witnesses. Unfortunately, the danger of contagion warranted against conducting face-to-face interviews. In any case, we excluded all GR-2013-02356043 participants who had obtained an MMSE score below 24 in their last visit, subjects with an Itel-MMSE score <17 and those unable to be interviewed according to their caregivers' judgment. Moreover, the data obtained from our sub-sample of participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are substantially consistent with those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).",68d09919-0c47-4329-9dfe-265665748b49
68,discussion17," This indicates that our participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be adequately informative.  Conclusions and Future Directions People at increased risk of dementia underwent changes in their lifestyles that are potentially harmful for their cognitive and mental health. In particular, increased levels of sedentary lifestyle, which together with a less healthy diet led to weight gain in over a third of the sample, less social interaction, and greater engagement in passive recreational activities. However, even if, with the exception of productive leisure activities, increased smoke, alcohol or caffeine consumption, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity or time spent watching TV seem not be cross-sectionally related with mental health issues, it is possible that they have long-term effects. Further follow-ups will help us verify this hypothesis.",4d4b6705-e30a-4959-855c-8c1541d01024
69,discussion18," The future directions should therefore focus on reducing loneliness, and on psychoeducational interventions, involving the patients and their caregivers to relieve anxiety associated with the onset of new respiratory symptoms, enhance awareness, healthy behaviors and reduce family conflicts, promoting the active listening, and mutual support between family members.
