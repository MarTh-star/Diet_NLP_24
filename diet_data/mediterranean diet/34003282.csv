0,methods0," 3.1. Literature Review  The literature review on the antidiabetic potential of Mediterranean plants was performed using the databases of Scopus [172] and Google Scholar [173]. More specifically, the search included the terms “antidiabetic activity”, “diabetes”, “hyperglycemia”, “hypoglycemic activity”, “alpha-glucosidase”, and “alpha-amylase” in combination with “scientific plant name” and “common plant name” of Mediterranean plants. The antidiabetic potency of several plants was searched according to a list, which was prepared based on their abundance in the Mediterranean flora and/or diet.  Subsequently, data for the phytochemical composition of plants were collected using the same databases. The terms “scientific plant name”, “common plant name”, “phytochemicals”, “bioactive compounds”, “Liquid chromatography”, “Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)”, and “Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS)” were used to build the compound library.  3.2.",abd335f1-c5b6-4db8-8827-c787905b79c7
1,methods1," Determination of Anti-Diabetic Activity Using DIA-DB Inverse Virtual Screening Web Server  At first, a simplified molecular-input line-entry system (simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES)) notation was created for each compound, which was obtained from PubChem. [174]. All simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) notations are demonstrated in Table 3. The simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) notation of each compound was subsequently submitted to the DIA-DB web server that employs an inverse virtual screening of compounds with Autodock Vina against a given set of 18 protein targets associated with diabetes.",c372d23a-d209-4387-b4ed-499faafb872d
2,methods2," The 18 protein targets can be classified into the three following groups: (i) regulation of insulin secretion and/or sensitivity (DPP4, FFAR1, HSD11B1, insulin receptor (INSR), PTPN9, RBP4), (ii) regulation of glucose metabolism (AKR1B1, AMY2A, FBP1, glucokinase (GCK), MGAM, PDK2, phosphorylase (PYGL)), and (iii) regulation of lipid metabolism (NR5A2, PPARA, PPARD, PPARG, retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA)) [2,175]. More specifically, the targets were aldose reductase (AKR1B1), AMY2A, FBP1, free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1), glucokinase (glucokinase (GCK)), 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1), insulin receptor (insulin receptor (INSR)), MGAM, NR5A2, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2 (PDK2), PPARA, PPARD, PPARG, PTPN9, liver glycogen phosphorylase (phosphorylase (PYGL)), RBP4, and retinoid X receptor alpha (retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA)). A cut-off docking score of −8 kcal mol−1 was set to distinguish between potential active and inactive compounds.  3.3.",a0240208-52c6-4863-9433-a0f850568d4e
3,methods3," Evaluation of Molecular Similarity of Predicted Active Phytochemicals and Known/Experimental Antidiabetic Drugs  The similarities studies with known/experimental antidiabetic drugs were performed according to a previous work [176]. The molecular similarity was performed using the metric of the Tanimoto similarity on the calculated ECFP4 molecular fingerprints of the compounds. The molecular similarity network was generated with Cytoscape and the ChemViz2 Application version 1.1.0.  4. Conclusions  The present study was undertaken to shed light on the antidiabetic properties of edible Mediterranean plants. Our results showed that the most active compounds within examined Mediterranean plants are flavonoids that are widely distributed in herbs, vegetables, medicinal plants, and fruits. Our findings also show that the glycosylation of flavonoids potentially improves its antidiabetic activity.",fcbd604a-5c93-450f-93cd-0c4c3debc41e
4,methods4," Both the evaluation of antidiabetic activity and molecular similarity of antidiabetic dugs highlighted the antidiabetic potential of hesperidin and rutin. Finally, the present study showed that the employment of the DIA-DB inverse virtual screening web server allows us to explain the antidiabetic effects of natural products and to pinpoint the most active compounds.
