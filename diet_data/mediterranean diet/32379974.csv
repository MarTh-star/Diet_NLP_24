0,methods0," 2.1. Study Population  The Mediterranean Healthy Eating Lifestyle and Aging (MEAL) study is an observational study focusing on the link between nutritional and lifestyle habits typical to the Mediterranean area and non-communicable diseases. The study protocol has been described elsewhere [21]. Briefly, the study enrollment took place between 2014 and 2015 in the main districts of the city of Catania in southern Italy. A sample of 2044 men and women aged 18 or more years old was randomly selected and included in the baseline data. Data collection was carried out on using the registered records of local general practitioners stratified by sex and 10-year age groups. In order to provide a specific relative precision of 5% (Type I error, 0.05; Type II error, 0.10), considering an anticipated 70% participation rate, the theoretical sample size was estimated to 1500 individuals.",08856fbf-9015-4af4-bc12-29727b0ec053
1,methods1,"  Out of 2405 individuals invited to participate in the study, 361 refused leaving 2044 participants (response rate of 85%) as the final sample. Taking into consideration that the investigated outcome is more prevalent in the older population, the analysis for the present study was limited to individuals 50 years old or older (n = 916). All participants were familiarized about goals of the Mediterranean Healthy Eating Lifestyle and Aging (MEAL) study and informed written consent was obtained. The study protocol has been refereed and approved by the concerning ethical committee and all the study procedures were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1989) of the World Medical Association.  2.2. Data Collection  A face-to-face assisted personal interview was conducted during which all participants were provided with a paper copy of the questionnaire in order to visualize the response options.",1d4cbdd7-d105-43d8-9160-08702172b505
2,methods2," However, the final answers were registered directly by the interviewer using tablet computers. Information regarding sociodemographic and lifestyle factors was collected [22]. The sociodemographic data included age at recruitment, sex, and educational status (low (primary/secondary school), medium (high school), and high (university)). Lifestyle variables included physical activity (low, moderate, high; determined by using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) [23]), smoking status (non-smoker, ex-smoker, and current smoker), and alcohol drinking (none, moderate drinker (0.1–12 g/d) and regular drinker (>12 g/d)).  2.3. Dietary Assessment  Aiming to determine the dietary intake, two food frequency questionnaires (FFQ, a long and a short version) previously proved for validity and reliability for the Sicilian population were adapted [24,25].",38eaeb93-f376-4d7c-b0c9-df474771303a
3,methods3," Employing the determination of the food intake, the energy content as well as the macro- and micronutrients intake was calculated using food composition tables of the Italian Research Center for Foods and Nutrition [26]. Intake of seasonal foods referred to consumption during the period in which the food was available adjusting by its proportional intake over one year.  Diet quality was evaluated by means of adherence to the Mediterranean diet [27]. Briefly, a literature-based scoring system, which is based on the frequency of intake of different food groups was used. In particular, food groups characteristic to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (such as fruit, vegetables, cereals, legumes, fish, and olive oil) were given positive points, while food groups not representing it (such as meat and dairy products) were given negative points; moderate alcohol intake was deemed as optimal for higher adherence.",d7b00e59-267a-4d03-90f3-6333f6ea2d48
4,methods4," The final score indicative of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was based on nine food categories with a score ranging from 0 (lowest adherence) to 18 points (highest adherence), and individuals clustered in tertiles categorized as low, medium, and high adherent to the Mediterranean diet [28]. FFQs with unreliable intakes (<1000 or >6000 kcal/d) were excluded from the analyses (n = 33) leaving a total of 883 individuals included in the analysis.  2.4. Estimation of Phenolic Acid Consumption  The process of the estimation of dietary phenolic acid intake has been previously described in detail [29]. Briefly, data on the phenolic acid content in plant-based foods and beverages were retrieved from the Phenol-Explorer database [14]. First, the food and beverage consumption was calculated (in g or mL) by following the standard portion sizes used in the study and then converted in 24-h intake.",bf0f0756-c41f-4b5a-a0b5-94dc8bd7a00e
5,methods5," Afterwards, the Phenol-Explorer database was searched to retrieve mean content values for all phenolic acids contained in the applicable food items included in the FFQ, and phenolic acid intake from each food was determined by multiplying the content of total, main subclasses, and selected individual phenolic acids by the daily consumption of each food adjusted for total energy intake (kcal/d) using the residual method [30].  2.5. Cognitive Status Evaluation  Cognitive status assessment in the Mediterranean Healthy Eating Lifestyle and Aging (MEAL) study was performed using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ)) [31], which was designed to measure cognitive impairment in both the general and hospital population [32], and previously applied in the Italian population [33]. Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), a 10-item tool, was administered by the clinician in the office or in a hospital.",0a20e458-ed50-46b5-bd01-e43bbafa8cc5
6,methods6," The predefined domains for assessment of the screening tool were the following: (i) intact, less than 3 errors; (ii) mild, 3–4 errors; (iii) moderate, 5–7 errors, and (iv) severe, 8 or more errors. For this study, we considered more than 2 errors as a cut-off point for impaired cognitive status.  2.6. Statistical Analysis  Categorical variables are presented as frequencies of occurrence and percentages; differences between groups were tested with Chi-squared test. Continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations (SDs) or median and standard errors (SEs) whether they were distributed normally or skewed, respectively; differences between groups were tested with Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney U-test for variables distributed normally or skewed, respectively.",56b2fe32-f04d-434d-8401-adaf5ffeeb40
7,methods7," The relation between exposure variables and cognitive status was tested through uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for baseline characteristics (age, sex, educational status, smoking and alcohol drinking habits, and physical activity level). An additional model was performed to further adjust for adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as a proxy variable for diet quality. The association between major dietary sources of phenolic acids and cognitive status was finally evaluated. All reported p-values were based on two-sided tests and compared to a significance level of 5%. SPSS 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software was used for all the statistical calculations.  3. Results  A total of 883 individuals were included in the analyses of this study. The mean age was 64.9 years old, 56.7% were female. Eighty individuals (9.1% of the sample) were categorized as having impaired cognitive status. The mean intake of phenolic acids was 346.6 mg/d.",275b0ad8-8a58-4382-ac99-81d4e2c15abe
8,methods9," The age of study participants varied when considering level of the exposure to dietary phenolic acid intake. There were significant differences in the distribution of the variables such as smoking status and physical activity level among the quartiles of phenolic acids intake, however with no particular trends toward healthier or unhealthier behaviors. Additionally, there was a higher proportion of regular alcohol drinkers among the highest quartile of phenolic acid intake. When considering the quartiles with greater phenolic acid intake, a higher proportion of individuals with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet was observed (Table 1).  After adjustment for potential confounding factors, individuals in the highest quartile of total phenolic acid intake (median intake = 509.2 mg/day) were less likely to have impaired cognitive status than those consuming the least (OR = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.92)), although there was no clear trend across quartiles of exposure (Table 2).",ccacc98b-2fa7-43fe-bae7-922ebd0ea376
9,methods10," The analysis for subclasses of phenolic acids showed that individuals with the highest intake of hydroxycinnamic acids (highest vs. lowest category, OR = 0.35 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.91)) were less likely to have impaired cognitive status (Table 2). Moreover, a similar inverse association was also found for the third versus the first quartile of intake of hydroxyphenylacetic acid (OR = 0.26 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.63)). Among individual compounds investigated, only higher intake of caffeic acid resulted inversely associated with impaired cognitive status (OR = 0.32 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.93)); notably, the association with ferulic acid intake was significant when adjusting for background characteristics, but further adjustment for adherence to the Mediterranean diet nullified the results (OR = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.16, 1.07)).  The association between major dietary sources of phenolic acids and cognitive status is shown in Table 3. Individuals in the highest category of consumption of coffee (OR = 0.",ff3e649e-9e49-4f3a-8039-a940a2702168
10,methods11,"44 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.98)) and tea (OR = 0.30 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.72)) were less likely to have impaired cognitive status. On the contrary, no significant association was found for olive oil, nuts and beer intake.  4. Discussion  To our knowledge, this is the first observational study to examine the association between total dietary phenolic acids and their individual compounds intake and cognitive status. We observed that higher intakes of total phenolic acids and hydroxycinnamic acids were significantly inversely associated with cognitive impairment. Furthermore, among individual compounds, caffeic acid and ferulic acid showed a potential beneficial effect toward cognitive status.  Up to date, solely two observational studies investigated the association between dietary phenolic acid intake and cognitive status [34,35].",a04c6035-b375-41bc-8d3b-cbecedec6e96
11,methods12," A prospective cohort study of 806 elderlies followed-up for 6 years showed a significant inverse association between higher dietary phenolic acid intake and cognitive decline, however, a clear linear trend in the association was not observed [34]. The results of SU.VI.MAX study conducted on 2574 middle-aged adults demonstrated that higher intake of hydroxybenzoic acids was positively associated with language and verbal memory, suggesting that diet high in phenolic acids may favor preservation of the verbal memory [35].  In accordance with the literature, the results of this study showed that intake of beverages containing phenolic acids, such as coffee and tea, may significantly impact cognitive status [36,37].",320e525c-30a3-4dae-aefb-03a6205ea665
12,methods13," However, when interpreting these results it should be taken into consideration that the average daily intake of phenolic acids and their major food sources greatly differs across European populations [29,38,39]: in fact, to our knowledge, the present study is the first reporting such results in a population with very low consumption of tea, and relatively low consumption of coffee, compared to northern European countries, thus these results should be interpreted in this context.  Consistent with evidence from experimental studies, the results found in the present study suggest that individuals with high intake of hydroxycinnamic acids, as well as individual compounds such as caffeic acid and ferulic acid are less likely to have impaired cognitive status. From a mechanistic point of view, phenolic acids may affect cognitive function through various pathways including both direct and indirect modes of action.",82b03671-6c16-4de0-b692-ab0f2706a996
13,methods14," Phenolic acids have been shown to modulate different factors associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, and thus indirectly affect cognitive health [40]. As suggested by the evidence from experimental studies, specific phenolic acids and their metabolites (i.e., caffeic acid, ferulic acid) have been found in cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that these compounds may cross the blood–brain barrier and thus directly affect brain cells [41,42]. Moreover, new evidence suggests that there is an interaction between dietary polyphenols and gut microbiota and their effect toward the brain [43,44]: it has been determined that gut microbiota composition significantly affects the bioavailability of polyphenols including phenolic acids and consequently may mediate and modulate the effect of dietary polyphenols toward cognitive health [45,46].",3efd5455-3c03-48b8-a7e4-ec7a08c9558a
14,methods15,"  Concerning the direct effects of phenolic acids on the central nervous system, it has been demonstrated that hydroxycinnamic acids and their esters may exert beneficial effects toward cognitive functions by improving neuronal cell antioxidant activity against oxidative stress [47,48], through various signaling pathways including Nrf2/HO-1 pathway [49]. Moreover, hydroxycinnamic acids have been shown to rescue memory deficits in animal models of diabetes induced by streptozotocin through the reduction of oxidative stress and the positive modulation of the PI3-kinase pathway [50,51]. Among hydroxybenzoic acids, gallic acid has been shown to reverse impaired learning and memory in a rodent model of Alzheimer’s disease through simultaneous elevation of α-secretase and reduction of β-secretase activity and, most importantly, activation of metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 [52].",dcc05d10-2e78-4b62-8767-83a0c714f198
15,methods16," Furthermore, its role in modulation of neuroinflammation and the prevention of brain oxidative stress has been suggested. Recent studies also suggest that gallic acid can bind beta-amyloid monomers and prevent beta-amyloid aggregation, a primary event in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease [53]. Similarly, an increase in hippocampal dendritic spines and decreased oxidative stress and inflammation has been observed after administration of gallic acid in rats with metabolic syndrome [54], indicating that gallic acid could also play a protective role in the prevention of cognitive impairment triggered, at least partially, by metabolic disorders. Ellagic acid, which belongs to hydroxybenzoic acids, has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects by modulating neuroinflammation is a promising constituent for improving cognitive impairment [55] and alleviating memory impairment [56].",c0dd5e9b-fd98-46c5-a391-64ed932d5250
16,methods17," The neuroprotective activity of ellagic acid has been also validated in APP/PS1 mice, a validated transgenic animal model of Alzheimer’s disease, where it prevents neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and rescues memory deficits through the inhibition of beta-amyloid production and tau hyperphosphorylation [57].  Ferulic acid has been shown to promote neural differentiation and neurite outgrowth by exerting antiapoptotic and neuronal differentiation-inducing effects in a dose-dependent manner [58], while caffeic acid esters were found to influence the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a neurotrophic factor implicated in neuron survival, adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity [59].",64f07b2d-baa4-4e10-ba24-00291d4dba19
17,methods18," The neuroprotective activity of ferulic acid is well-established and it is currently adopted as a potential pharmacophore in drug discovery processes for Alzheimer’s disease due to its multimodal mechanism of action which combines antioxidant and antiaggregant effects against Aβ oligomers with a Cholinesterase inhibition and a significant anti-inflammatory activity [60]. Different ferulic acid-based hybrid analogs are currently studied as multitarget directed ligands to develop novel hybrid compounds against Alzheimer’s disease [60].  Notwithstanding the novelty of this study, which for the first time explored the association between total phenolic acid and their individual components intake and cognitive status among the adult population, the results should be considered in light of some limitations.  First, given the cross-sectional design of the study, we cannot define the causal relation.",174a192c-f88c-4da1-b834-5aadafa02780
18,methods19," Second, despite adjustment for potential confounders, including dietary factors, even though unlikely, residual confounding may be possible. However, after adjustment for the adherence to the Mediterranean diet most of the associations remained significant. Third, the use of FFQs may be susceptible to recall bias and potential inaccuracy in estimating dietary intake at least partially attributable to interpersonal variability in phenolic acids intake directly related to food quality (i.e., plant variety, season and environmental factors, food storage and processing). Finally, interindividual differences in the bioavailability and physiological response to phenolic acids exposure cannot be established [61].  5. Conclusions  In the present Mediterranean cohort, greater intakes of dietary phenolic acids were significantly inversely associated with impaired cognition.",7657c7b3-dccb-4317-b26c-2b6ea96fec7d
19,methods20," This association was confirmed for different phenolic acid subclasses and several individual compounds, emphasizing the importance of investigating a broad range of compounds in future studies to better elucidate their effect toward cognitive function. If confirmed, these findings may have important implications for cognitive decline prevention, given that the availability of modifiable risk factors which may impact cognition is limited.
