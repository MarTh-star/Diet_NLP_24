Study Participants Twenty-seven overweight or moderately obese men with a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) of 25 to 35 kg/m2, 27–42 years of age, with ultrasonography-diagnosed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), were enrolled in this study (Figure 1). All participants received a full medical examination and performed standard blood tests before enrolment. Participants were recruited at the Centre of Research Excellence in Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Medical Research, from February 2013 to March 2015. Randomization was performed using block-balanced randomization in a 1:1 ratio into the Med diet and low-fat diet groups using a computer-generated sequence. The inclusion criteria were adult male patients, overweight or moderately obese, with ultrasonography-confirmed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",ab267ccd-f0ce-4b7b-a59c-a86d187fee37
1,methods1," Subjects who had evidence of any liver disease other than nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, serious gastrointestinal disease, cardiac, renal, or active autoimmune disease were excluded from the study. The exclusion criteria also involved alcohol consumption (>20 g/day), smoking habits, and using hepatotoxic drugs. Weight loss of 3 kg or more in the last 3 months, taking antioxidant supplements or fish oil/omega (3 supplements), or high intakes of fish, flaxseed, or walnuts (more than 2 servings per week) were also exclusion criteria. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Belgrade (Ethics number 36/18/2011), in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, as part of a research project of the Ministry of Science of the Republic of Serbia (III41030).  2.2.

2,methods2," Participants were randomly assigned to consume a calorie-restricted (daily 600–800 kcal intake reduction) diet in the form of either the standard Med diet or a low-fat diet for 3 months. All participants received personalized nutritional counseling, and a daily dietary treatment, with 30% caloric restriction from the estimated daily energy requirements, was prescribed individually to achieve a loss of at least 5% of initial body weight. The daily energy requirements were calculated according to obesity treatment guidelines issued by the Board of the US National Institute of Health and Food and Nutrition [19]. The conventionally balanced distribution of macronutrients in the Med diet is 50% of the total caloric value from carbohydrates, 15% from proteins, and above 30% from lipids. In the low-fat diet, established macronutrient distribution was 60% of the total caloric value from carbohydrates (low glycemic index), 15% from proteins, and less than 25% from lipids.",ba3fa856-99f9-4b72-be6f-113a284eed2b
3,methods3," The calorie-restricted diets were also balanced in terms of micronutrient intake (vitamins and minerals in the recommended diet must always be checked). Both diets were designed to include breakfast, lunch, dinner, one snack in the morning, and one snack in the afternoon. Dietary intake was controlled by the size of portion, food choice, and composition. Participants in the calorie-restricted diet groups were educated by our medical dietitian on the principles of how to reduce daily energy intake and achieve weight reduction. Information concerning habitual dietary intake was obtained at the beginning of the study using a validated semiquantified food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)). All participants in both intervention groups received personalized nutritional counseling by a professional nutritionist. The two diets differed in nutritional composition, e.g., macronutrients, fiber, and antioxidants, as presented in Table S1.",a2b7fd7b-c3bb-47e7-b9fe-eaf5c237296f
4,methods4," Briefly, the Med diet is rich in vegetables, with increased poultry and fish intake and limited red meat consumption. Animal fats such as butter, cream, and lard are not allowed in this diet [11]. Participants assigned to the low-fat diet were advised to reduce their intake of all types of fats from both animal and vegetable sources. All participants in both groups were also advised to increase their level of physical activity by walking 30 min per day.  2.3.

Insulin level was measured using the radioimmunoassay method (INEP Zemun, Belgrade, Serbia). Fasting insulin and glucose concentrations were used to calculate insulin resistance from the HOMA-IR model (insulin × glucose/22.5). Hs-CRP was measured by the Olympus (LATEX) assay on the Olympus AU 400 analyzer (Olympus, Center Valley, PA, USA).  2.4. Anthropometric Parameters and Calculated Indexes The anthropometric measurements included height, weight, waist circumference, and body fat.",c9dd8eda-54cb-46d3-94a0-d562d44380cb
6,methods6," Waist circumference was measured from the midpoint between the lateral iliac crest and the lowest rib to the nearest 0.5 cm. Height was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer. Body weight and body fat percentage were measured using a Tanita body composition analyzer (model TBF–300, Tokyo, Japan) to the nearest 0.1 kg, with the subject wearing light clothes, without shoes. Body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m) squared. Abdominal ultrasonography, as a first-line investigation for hepatic steatosis, was performed on all patients by the same operator, who was unaware of the clinical and laboratory results, at the start and the end of the study. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was diagnosed by standardized criteria [20].

7,methods8," Fatty Acid Analysis As previously described, serum lipids and erythrocyte membrane lipids were extracted with a chloroform–methanol mixture (2:1 v/v) according to the methods of Sperry et al. and Harth et al., respectively [26]. The phospholipid fraction was isolated by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography, and direct transesterification of phospholipid FAs was applied. Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by gas–liquid chromatography on the Shimadzu chromatograph GC 2014 (Kyoto, Japan), equipped with a flame ionization detector on an Rt × 2330 column (60 m × 0.25 mm ID, film thickness of 0.2 μm; RESTEK, Bellefonte, PA, USA).

8,methods9," Sample Size Calculation The sample size was calculated with triglycerides as primary outcomes based on a study by Abenavoli et al. [27] to detect differences of 55 mg/dL for TGs between study groups, with a 95% confidence interval (α = 0.05) and a statistical power of 80% (β = 0.8). The calculation estimated 11 participants per study group but expected a dropout rate of 10–20%; we included 13–14 patients per group.  2.7. Statistical Analysis The normality of the distribution of variables was checked using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed data are shown as mean values ± standard deviation (SD), while data with non-normal distribution (triglycerides, aminotransferase (AST), HOMA-IR, CRP, docosatetraenoic acid, ALA, EPA, and MUFA/PUFA ratio in serum and n-6/n-3 and MUFA/n-3 PUFA in erythrocytes) are presented as median values and interquartile ranges.",04e00494-05ff-432c-b912-2804c0a611b6
9,methods10," The differences between baseline and after the treatment period (intragroup comparisons) were determined by paired Student’s t-test (normally distributed) and Wilcoxon test (nonparametric data), while differences between the 3-month changes induced by the two diets were calculated by ANCOVA adjusted for baseline values. Univariate linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the potential association between anthropometry, clinical data, and biochemical parameters of the diet and the hepatic status variables. To provide an adjusted intergroup analysis, multivariable linear regression analyses were applied and adjusted for age and biochemical parameters, which showed significant differences in previous analyses (aminotransferase (AST), HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides). Analyses were carried out using the SPSS 20 program (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). A p-value < 0.05 indicates statistical significance.  3.",ddf3d2ad-3fbc-424f-a57f-94c145316e9d
10,methods11," Results The anthropometric and clinical characteristics of the study participants are presented in Table 1. Study participants had body mass index (BMI)s of about 30 kg/m2 and waist circumferences >94 cm. At the start, there were no differences in mean age, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, body fat percentage, visceral adiposity (VAI), fatty liver (FLI), and hepatic steatosis (HSI) between the groups. All the parameters were significantly improved after 12 weeks on the Med or low-fat diet (p < 0.001 compared to baseline). In terms of the fatty liver (FLI) index, both diets were very effective, decreasing the index markedly in all study participants. Comparison of the efficacy of the two diets showed that the Med diet reduced fatty liver (FLI) more than the low-fat diet. In addition, at the end of the study, six men from the Med group and eight men from the low-fat group had ultrasonographic findings of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",83e8e17c-77b1-4394-8ef8-ea70c04c8e5b
11,methods12,"  Table 2 shows biochemical parameters before and after Med or low-fat diet in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. There was n difference in the baseline levels of serum biochemical parameters, HOMA index, TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, and lipid accumulation product index. After 12 weeks, both diets significantly reduced triglycerides, total and LDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and hs-CRP concentration and activities of liver enzymes (aminotransferase (ALT), aminotransferase (AST), GGT). Consequently, lipid accumulation product index, HOMA-IR index, and TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio decreased (p < 0.001 compared to baseline) after treatments. In Med and low-fat diet groups, TGs severely decreased by 1 and 0.83 mmol/L and the TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio by 0.85 and 0.75, respectively. In the Med diet group, HDL-cholesterol levels increased more than in the low-fat diet group (p < 0.05).",0bb36e24-7c14-464f-a192-1a50ff960c82
12,methods13," Additionally, in the intergroup comparison, in the Med diet patients, we found more exerted reductions of triglycerides, TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, aminotransferase (AST), and lipid accumulation product index, as well as increased HDL-cholesterol, than in the low-fat diet group.  At the baseline, there were no significant differences in the percentage of FAs in serum phospholipids between the two study groups (Table 3). The Med diet induced a significant decrease in saturated FA 16:0 and total saturated fatty acid (saturated fatty acid (SFA)) levels compared to baseline and the low-fat group. Levels of EPA, DHA, and total n-3 PUFA significantly increased after both diet treatments. Consequently, the n-6/n-3 total PUFA ratio decreased in both groups. Unlike the Med group, the low-fat group demonstrated decreased oleic acid (18:1 n-9, p < 0.05) and total MUFAs (p < 0.05) in serum phospholipids.",5041ef42-4beb-4e43-a593-29cac0d2cc19
13,methods14," Accordingly, after the low-fat diet, the MUFA/n-3 and MUFA/PUFA ratios decreased compared to baseline, while in the Med group, MUFA/saturated fatty acid (SFA) and MUFA/n-6 increased and MUFA/n-3 decreased significantly. In addition, the change from baseline to the endpoint was significantly different in proportions of palmitic acid and saturated fatty acid (SFA), which were higher in the low-fat diet group than in the Med diet group, and oleic acid, MUFA, DHA, and MUFA/saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratio, which were all higher in the Med diet group at the end of the treatment than in the Low-fat group (Table 3).  The effects of the diets on the percentage of FAs in erythrocyte phospholipids are given in Table 4. Both diets significantly increased DHA and total n-3 PUFAs, while the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio decreased. The Med diet also increased the percentage of oleic acid, total MUFAs (p < 0.01), as well as the MUFA/saturated fatty acid (SFA) (p < 0.01) and MUFA/n-6 ratios (p < 0.05).",8f6bf93a-4a8e-47ff-9f55-55fbf8561a2c
14,methods15," At the end of the treatment, 16:0 and total saturated fatty acid (SFA)s were higher and n-6 PUFAs and total PUFAs were lower in the low-fat diet group compared to the Med diet group. Nevertheless, no significant differences were found when we compared 3-month differences in the Med group with 3-month differences in the low-fat group using ANCOVA.  Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the factors that could influence the markers of hepatic status after 3 months of the Med and low-fat diets (Table S2). In the Med diet, the decrease in body fat percentage was significantly associated with improvements in hepatic steatosis markers: visceral adiposity (VAI), fatty liver (FLI), lipid accumulation products, aminotransferase (AST), and triglyceride level. The same predictor was significantly associated with a decrease in aminotransferase (AST) and aminotransferase (ALT) in the low-fat group.",0722a9b4-50c7-464a-8e2b-3b8d87719f2c
15,methods16," Reduced waist circumference was associated with improved hepatic steatosis (HSI) and aminotransferase (ALT) in the low-fat diet group. Further, changes in HOMA-IR were associated with a reduction of visceral adiposity (VAI), fatty liver (FLI), lipid accumulation products, and triglycerides in the Med diet group and with visceral adiposity (VAI) in the low-fat diet group. The changes in FA status showed no significant association with the parameters of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (data not shown). Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to assess the influence of different types of diets on the decrease in fatty liver (FLI), adjusted for age, and biochemical parameters aminotransferase (AST), HDL, and TGs, which showed significant differences from the previous analyses (Table 5).",d3680240-0cb8-4000-bc05-b25aadf72219
16,methods17," The results have shown that the decrease of fatty liver (FLI) was statistically and significantly associated with the type of diet, demonstrating that persons on the Med diet will have a greater reduction of fatty liver (FLI) than those who are adherent to the low-fat diet (β = 0.377; p = 0.043; adjusted R2 = 0.103). Model 2 has shown that the type of diet influences a decrease in fatty liver (FLI) independently of age (β = 0.452; p = 0.023), while Model 3 has demonstrated that biochemical parameters aminotransferase (AST), HDL, and triglycerides did not affect fatty liver (FLI) changes (β = 0.466; p = 0.032).  4. Discussion Nutrition and dietary patterns have been proposed as potential environmental factors that can affect the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The basic recommendation for individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is lifestyle modification, including dietary interventions.",74859670-1353-4b5e-9d5c-cc37ad41a126
17,methods18," However, the evidence for nutritional factors, dietary characteristics, and dietary strategies for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) treatment remains inconclusive. In the present study, we have shown that at a 3-month follow-up, both calorie-restricted dietary treatments, the Med diet and a low-fat diet, in male overweight or moderately obese participants with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced (1) overall decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, glucose, hs-CRP, and liver enzymes levels; (2) significant weight loss (>9%); (3) improvement in ultrasonography findings, body fat percentage, waist circumference, visceral adiposity (VAI), fatty liver (FLI), hepatic steatosis (HSI), and lipid accumulation index; (4) increased n-3 PUFAs levels in serum and erythrocyte phospholipids.",f48dc8bc-50f6-48f4-aefa-005d3c9bc4db
18,methods19," Our results confirm that dietary patterns represent a central therapeutic issue in the improvement of obesity-related metabolic alterations involved in the mechanism of hepatic steatosis. Moreover, the Med diet leads to greater improvements of aminotransferase (ALT), HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, lipid accumulation products, fatty liver (FLI), and DHA and MUFAs content in serum phospholipids compared to a low-fat diet.  Both calorie-restricted dietary treatments in our study resulted in more than 9% of body weight loss. Weight loss remains the cornerstone of therapy in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Findings from meta-analyses suggest that ≥5% of weight loss may have beneficial effects on liver and cardiometabolic parameters and steatosis.",5f5f9afb-4ff3-47d8-913f-ac9609527865
19,methods20," Additionally, ≥7% of weight loss improves histological disease activity in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver injury (plasma aminotransferase (ALT), aminotransferase (AST)), which is in accordance with our results [7,28]. In regression analyses, a decrease of body fat percentage at the endpoint of the intervention was associated with improved visceral adiposity (VAI), fatty liver (FLI), lipid accumulation products, and aminotransferase (ALT) in the participants on the Med diet and also with aminotransferase (ALT) and aminotransferase (AST) improvements in those on the low-fat diet. Furthermore, reduced waist circumference in the low-fat diet group has shown associations with hepatic steatosis (HSI) and aminotransferase (ALT). The improvement in steatosis index in both diet groups is an important indicator of lifestyle modification benefits in our nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients.",664f1b5e-6a11-4fc0-8155-e6b4ed4d9253
20,methods21," fatty liver (FLI), hepatic steatosis (HSI), and lipid accumulation product index, as steatosis biomarkers, are helpful in the clinical assessment of the severity of liver steatosis [22,23,24,25]. The group on the Med diet had a more pronounced improvement in fatty liver (FLI); 50% of the patients (6 out of 12) lost the ultrasonography findings of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is in accordance with a previous report [6,27]. Multivariate regression analysis has shown that a decrease in fatty liver (FLI) is greater after the Med diet, independent of age and biochemical parameters of the study participants.  Although both diets improved lipid status in our nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, the Med diet led to a higher increase of HDL-cholesterol and a decrease in triglycerides and the TG/HDL cholesterol ratio.",07c14c56-915c-4fb0-9fed-b0a1b86d7b92
21,methods22," Lower levels of circulating triglycerides, which we detected after the dietary treatments, may be due to a lower synthesis of hepatic triglycerides, and/or lower secretions of very low-density lipoprotein (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL))-TGs in plasma. It is considered that an imbalance between the intrahepatic production of triglycerides, and the removal of intrahepatic triglycerides is the basis for the accumulation of fat in the liver [29]. The increase in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG secretion, which is the major source of circulating triglycerides, is most probably responsible for the higher levels of triglycerides, commonly observed in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [30]. Furthermore, patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have an increased expression of HMG-CoA reductase and, consequently, increased synthesis of hepatic cholesterol [31].",14e58213-2137-42a8-b9c0-71d856e4c5ae
22,methods23," Several studies have confirmed that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with elevated fasting cholesterol, TG and LDL concentrations, and lower HDL-cholesterol concentration, which is in accordance with our results [31,32,33]. This atherogenic lipid profile and higher TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio can be associated with different pathologies such as insulin resistance, obesity and metabolic syndrome, commonly found in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients [34].  Besides lipids, the serum concentration of liver enzymes markedly decreased after the diets in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and aminotransferase (AST) was even more reduced after the Med diet than at the end of the low-fat diet. These findings are, in agreement with other authors [35,36], a result of weight loss. At baseline, all participants in our study had HOMA-IR indexes >4, which were improved at the end of the study.",30e78d4c-da5f-476d-b064-99222a0c36fb
23,methods24," Moreover, changes in HOMA-IR were associated with improved visceral adiposity (VAI) in both diets and fatty liver (FLI), lipid accumulation products, and triglycerides in the Med diet group, as shown by the regression analysis. Thus, the HOMA-IR index is a useful method for not only diagnosing insulin resistance but also to follow-up the effects of treatments on patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The evidence from recent clinical and epidemiological studies strongly support the concept that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome [37,38].  Due to lower amounts of saturated fatty acid (SFA)s, the Med diet, unlike the low-fat diet, induced a significant decrease of 16:0 and total saturated fatty acid (SFA)s in serum phospholipids.",a4947246-0bf6-4fb4-8950-e042b53a84c4
24,methods25," saturated fatty acid (SFA) accumulation in plasma and liver is a general hallmark of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), causing direct and indirect toxic effects, including altered lipid homeostasis, disruption of desaturase activities, and hepatocyte injury [39,40]. In addition, the Med diet is rich in n-3 PUFAs, which promote essential FA desaturation and elongation, leading to increased utilization and lower levels of proinflammatory arachidonic acid [41]. Both diets increased EPA, DHA, and total n-3 PUFA levels and decreased the n-6/n-3 ratio, resulting in an improvement of serum phospholipid FA profiles. As n-3 PUFAs are precursors for anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, their dietary-induced uprise diminishes hepatotoxic alternations in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [40]. The reduced n-6/n-3 ratio found in both study groups could be related to reduced hepatic steatosis.",620d6af1-5844-4257-b42e-a285400c693d
25,methods26," In addition, an elevated n-6/n-3 ratio is associated with attenuated lipid oxidation and secretion and increased lipid accumulation in the liver [41,42]. Even more, PUFAs can be enzymatically released from membrane phospholipids [41]. Then, free long-chain n-3 PUFAs act as inhibitors of lipogenic and glycolytic genes and/or activators of genes involved in lipid oxidation, contributing to the beneficial effects of the diets. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is also characterized by impaired activity of key enzymes in PUFA biosynthesis [16]. Thus, the higher increase of DHA levels in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients after the Med diet compared to the low-fat diet group may indicate a greater efficacy of the Med diet to restore Δ-5 and Δ-6 FA desaturase activities. Due to increased olive oil consumption, the Med diet also provides more MUFAs than the low-fat diet, which results in higher proportions of oleic acid and total MUFAs in serum phospholipids.",9e57124e-9068-49ad-8b2d-47dcbbc6ca28
26,methods27," Through directly affecting the synthesis of various antioxidative enzymes, increased intakes of oleic acid may reduce liver tissue damage generated by oxidative stress [43]. Thus, protection from MUFAs depletion is another way for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients to benefit from the Med diet; favorable changes in FA profiles are significantly higher after the Med diet than after the low-fat diet.  Since approximately 5 months are needed for erythrocyte FA composition to reach saturation [44], a 3-month dietary treatment was insufficient to induce similar changes in erythrocytes as found in serum phospholipids. Nevertheless, some changes and trends can be seen even after the 3-month intervention [45,46]. Here, we found increased oleic acid, MUFAs, EPA, DHA, and n-3 PUFAs, as well as MUFA/saturated fatty acid (SFA) and decreased n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio in the Med diet group after the intervention period.",fbbfd886-f5a2-42f6-812b-66714505e6ff
27,methods28," In the low-fat group, there were higher levels of DHA, n-3 PUFAs, and a reduced n-6/n-3 ratio. According to literature data, a dietary-induced erythrocyte DHA enrichment is associated with a reduced liver fat percentage in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [41]. Additionally, dietary n-3 PUFAs modulate lipid metabolism, enhance FA oxidation, and decrease de novo lipogenesis [47]. Therefore, the increased erythrocyte n−3 PUFAs found in our study may contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) therapy. In line with this, a recent meta-analysis provided substantial evidence that n-3 PUFA supplementation, especially DHA, has a favorable effect in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [17].  This study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. A very large number of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related biomarkers have been tested and, therefore, many of the findings may not be independent of each other.",af6f0bac-126b-4130-a4d5-24f6eca63426
28,methods29," Since no penalization of p-values has been performed due to multiple comparisons, and the sample size is calculated for a p threshold of 0.05, these results should be considered exploratory and further confirmed in future studies. Therefore, the major limitation is the relatively small sample size and relatively short duration of the intervention, especially to detect changes in erythrocyte fatty acid profiles; in spite of this, it can provide a rationale for a large study that would involve more participants and a longer duration. Further, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was diagnosed using noninvasive ultrasound techniques instead of a liver biopsy, which is the most reliable technique for assessing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients. However, liver biopsy is an invasive method and, thus, unacceptable for many patients, and it is also related to sampling errors and possible procedure-related complications [48].",2c9c4a5f-3b68-4e0e-a0bb-e3aa2268d8a9
29,methods30," To mitigate the limitations of the ultrasonography approach, all evaluations were carried out by the same experienced specialist.  The major strengths of this study are that it was a randomized controlled trial and that the adherence to the diets was very high, as regularly checked by phone. Moreover, the personalized approach in dietary counseling and regular, individual follow-ups provided a good basis for long-term lifestyle modifications.  5. Conclusions In summary, our study has shown that lifestyle modifications, mostly dietary calorie-restricted treatments with moderate physical activity, can markedly improve hepatic steatosis, fatty acid profiles, and obesity-related cardiometabolic alterations in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. In particular, the Mediterranean diet was associated with improvements in lipid profiles and fatty liver biochemical indexes, as well as lower saturated fatty acid status and higher levels of monounsaturated and n-3 fatty acids.",dc6487dc-ea38-4fa0-8e80-c1422642de22
30,methods31," Our results point out the potential utility of this dietary pattern for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. However, future studies should confirm whether these changes are responsible for the benefits of the Med Diet in clinically relevant outcomes in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
