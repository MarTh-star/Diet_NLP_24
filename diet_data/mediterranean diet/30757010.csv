0,methods0,"2.1. Design and Study Population Participants in this study were recruited from the cross-sectional FUPRECOL study [10]. Briefly, the FUPRECOL study was designed to examine the associations between physical fitness levels, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors in Colombian youths. Two research groups are involved in the project: (a) Center of Studies in Physical Activity Measurements, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Rosario, and (b) District Education Secretary, Bogotá, DC. All participants were of low–middle socioeconomic status (SES; 1–3 in a scale of 1–6 defined by the Colombian government) and were enrolled in 20 public elementary and high schools (i.e., grades 5–11). The participants answered a questionnaire (paper-and-pencil format) containing information on socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioral variables (i.e., alcohol intake, diet, tobacco) during the 2014–2015 school year.",daf7c5db-4881-4a09-b3c7-cc34f519bf39
1,methods1,"   The sample consisted of children and adolescents (n = 4000 boys and n = 4000 girls) aged 9–17.9 years. In a subgroup of 2775 (35%) participants, parameters of biochemical profile were also assessed, and a more comprehensive health and lifestyle assessment was conducted. Of the 2775 participants who took part in the FUPRECOL subgroup study, a total of 1919 (53.0% girls) remained in the present analysis after excluding participants without a 20-meter shuttle run test (20mSRT) score (n = 37), body mass index >25 kg/m2 (n = 455), without a biochemical profile (n = 180), and WC (n = 184) values. The FUPRECOL study was approved by the Rosario University Institutional Review Board for research on human subjects (Code CEI-ABN026-000262) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association for Human Subjects).   2.2.",797578ed-c156-4dbb-9fad-03b69cdffcd2
2,methods2," Anthropometric Measurements  In order to standardize the evaluation process and to minimize inter-observer variability, six theoretical and practical sessions were run by the researchers to train the staff in all procedures of the study. Body weight and height were measured in underwear and without shoes using an electronic scale (with an accuracy of 0.1 kg) (BF-689 Children’s Body Fat Monitor - Tanita, Tokyo, Japan) and a mechanical stadiometer platform (with an accuracy of 0.1 cm) (Seca 217–213; Seca, Hamburg, Germany), respectively. body mass index (BMI) was also calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). WC was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the level of the umbilicus, using a tape measure (W606PM; Lufkin, Parsippany, NJ) and the average of the three measurements was used in the analyses. Intra-observer and inter-observer technical error of measurement (technical error of measurement (TEM)) for WC was (R = 0.",e9c71d08-942f-4a04-8f45-75ed2876b607
3,methods3,"979) and (technical error of measurement (TEM) = 1.32 %), respectively. Body fat was assessed using a bioelectrical impedance analysis (Tanita BC 420 MA/SC-331S®; Tokyo, Japan) as described previously [11]. The validity and reliability of these measures have been previously determined [11]. Finally, Normal weight obesity (NWO) was defined as a body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m2 and a percentage of body fat over the sex-age-specific 90th percentile for Colombian children and adolescents (boys > 23.4%–28.3% and girls > 31.0%–34.1%) [12].   2.3. Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Handgrip Strength Parameters  We assessed cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) by the 20-meter shuttle run test (20mSRT), as described in [13]. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak, mL·kg−1·min−1) was estimated by Barnett et al.’s [14] equation, which has the highest discriminatory accuracy for identifying unhealthy and healthy cardiometabolic risk in Colombian children and adolescents for sex and age (9–17.9 years) [15].",810b8ca4-f32e-4544-a606-b1c41161faab
4,methods4,"   Upper muscular strength was assessed using the maximum handgrip strength test with a digital dynamometer (T.K.K. 5401, Grip-D Smedley; Takei, Japan). The final score (kg) was calculated as the average of the scores for both hands. Handgrip strength was normalized as handgrip strength (in kg)/body weight (in kg). Children and adolescents were classified as healthy or unhealthy based on the sex and age cut-off points established previously [16].  2.4. Cardiometabolic Risk Factors  Cardiocheck® equipment (Mexglobal SA, Parsippany, NJ) was used to determine concentrations of glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in capillary blood samples after overnight fasting. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was measured using Friedewald’s formula if TG values were ≤400 mg/dL. All assays were performed in duplicate.",be443662-038c-477f-9e88-7bf415bb702a
5,methods5,"  Resting blood pressure was measured with an automated blood pressure monitor (Omrom® HEM 705 CP; Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan). The average of two measurements was recorded with the youth seated in a quiet room.  A cardiometabolic risk score was created from the sum of the z-scores values of systolic blood pressure, serum triglycerides, WC, HDL-C (multiplied by −1), and fasting glucose z-score [17] calculated as follows: (value–mean)/standard deviation (SD), separately for boys and girls, and for each 1-year age-group. A higher cardiometabolic risk z-score is indicative of an unhealthier risk profile [15,16].  2.5. Mediterranean Diet Adherence In order to determine the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the KIDMED questionnaire was used [18]. This tool has high consistency (α = 0.79) [19] and comprises 16 questions with an affirmative (twelve items) or negative (four items) response.",05e89e63-7c41-44df-8bfa-959b1e5c0c66
6,methods6," The sum of all values from the administered questionnaire was categorized into two levels: (1) 0–7, poor/average adherence and (2) 8–12, good adherence [18].   2.6. Pubertal Stage Sexual maturation was classified based on Tanner and Whitehouse staging of secondary sex characteristics [20] (breast and pubic hair development for girls, genital and pubic hair development for boys; ranging from stage I to V). We used three stages: pre-pubertal stage, pubertal stage, and late/post-pubertal stage.  2.7. Statistical Analysis Sample characteristics were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages were calculated for categorical variables. Data normality was verified by both Kolmogorov–Smirnov and graphical methods (normal probability plots).  Differences in mean values of cardiometabolic and physical fitness parameters according to group (i.e.",8560830b-0af7-4ad5-9a4d-e7fd95cf33e6
7,methods7,", normal weight lean (NWL) and Normal weight obesity (NWO)) were tested by the Mann–Whitney non-parametric test, since all dependent variables were skewed distribution. Differences in categorical variables were analyzed by using a chi-square test. Analysis of covariance (a chi square test Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)) was also used to compare means of each cardiometabolic and physical fitness parameter according to group (i.e., normal weight lean (NWL) and Normal weight obesity (NWO)) and adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), pubertal stage, and Mediterranean diet adherence (all dependent variables were log-transformed before inclusion in the models).  Finally, logistic regression models were employed to determine the odds of being classified as Normal weight obesity (NWO) according to cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) categories using unhealthy cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as a reference after adjusting for chronological age, pubertal stage, and Mediterranean diet adherence.",0a7361f8-6abc-4172-b0f0-ebf4718e037c
8,methods8," Alpha was set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS-PC statistical software (version 23.0, SPSS, Inc.).   3. Results The characteristics of the study group are shown in Table 1. The number of normal-weight youths included in the study was 1919 (53.0% girls), of which 46.0% were classified as Normal weight obesity (NWO) (47.0% girls). The Normal weight obesity (NWO) group was significantly older than the normal weight lean (NWL) group (p < 0.001). Regarding anthropometric parameters, the Normal weight obesity (NWO) group had significantly higher values for body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and body fat (all p < 0.001) than the normal weight lean (NWL) group.   To illustrate the degree to which both concepts (fitness vs. fatness) overlap, we reported the prevalence of each obesity group (normal weight lean (NWL) vs. Normal weight obesity (NWO)) according to the cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) groups (healthy and unhealthy), by sex (Figure 1).",b5afcdea-6b74-41cb-ae3c-5b7990f516ef
9,methods9," In girls, the category containing the unhealthy cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) plus Normal weight obesity (NWO) group was 72.0% vs. 42.3% in the cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) healthy group (p < 0.001). In boys, the proportions of subjects with unhealthy cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) plus Normal weight obesity (NWO) group were 56.8%, and 43.6% in the cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) healthy group. These findings indicate that those subjects positioned in the healthy cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and the normal weight lean (NWL) group present better health status than the Normal weight obesity (NWO) group, within unhealthy cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) values, p < 0.001.",2d8bd3f5-96e3-4826-878e-634eee93e851
10,methods10,"  Table 2 shows differences in cardiometabolic and physical fitness parameters between normal weight lean (NWL) and Normal weight obesity (NWO) youth, with the latter group (boys and girls) having significantly higher values for WC, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, cardiometabolic risk score, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) than the normal weight lean (NWL) group, and significantly lower values for in HDL-C. After adjusting for covariates, significant results were reduced and even disappeared for HDL-C and systolic blood pressure.  Finally, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) to be classified as Normal weight obesity (NWO) according to physical fitness parameters (cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and handgrip strength/body weight) categories are shown in Figure 2. For both sexes, the prevalence of Normal weight obesity (NWO) was lower in youths classified with healthy cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) levels (boys, OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.78; girls, OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.",c43a85af-e181-4f3d-b8ea-f0b35ffbb570
11,methods11,"50) (p < 0.001) compared to unhealthy peers.  4. Discussion Our findings reveal that Normal weight obesity (NWO) youth have a significantly poorer cardiometabolic profile and level of physical fitness than their normal weight lean (NWL) counterparts. A healthy level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) seems to be related to a lower prevalence of Normal weight obesity (NWO). Our results therefore indicate that using only body mass index (BMI) seems insufficient for the determination of cardiometabolic risk and suggest the need to include the assessment of body fat during childhood and adolescence. Thus, body fat measurement in normal-weight youths will provide additional information and allow us to determine and reduce their possible cardiometabolic risk.  Several recent studies have uncovered metabolic dysregulation in people classified with Normal weight obesity (NWO) [6], even among adolescents [9].",abc355fd-3a34-4bf2-94b3-ad93ab31a2ec
12,methods12," Confirming these results, our study suggests that Normal weight obesity (NWO) boys and girls show significantly higher levels for WC, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, and cardiometabolic risk score than their normal weight lean (NWL) peers, and a lower level of HDL-C. On the basis of published studies, we can speculate that youth with Normal weight obesity (NWO) show altered levels of proinflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to an increased risk of developing cardiometabolic disorders [6]. Similarly, Olafsdottir et al. [9] reported that metabolic risk was considerably higher among Normal weight obesity (NWO) adolescents than their normal weight lean (NWL) peers, with high WC being more prevalent in the former. This is consistent with the observation in children and adolescents that subcutaneous adiposity at the waist is a strong predictor of cardiometabolic risk [21].",e57c778c-ed97-4256-b851-4c8a52503b09
13,methods13," Taken together, these results suggest the need to establish strategies to screen for increased body fat as early as possible, because cardiometabolic risk parameters track from childhood to adulthood [22].  The benefits of health-related physical fitness during childhood are widely recognized and span many physical and mental health domains [7,8]. Specifically, a low level of muscular fitness is recognized as a marker of poor cardiometabolic and adipose tissue function during childhood and adolescence, and also in later life [8]. Moreover, higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) during youth is associated with lower risk of future overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome [7]. It is therefore not surprising that the normal weight lean (NWL) group in the present study showed higher cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness levels than Normal weight obesity (NWO) peers. Olafsdottir et al.",a6063342-46ae-4eef-b639-b888991cb91d
14,methods14," [9] also reported similar results among adolescents from Iceland, finding that Normal weight obesity (NWO) was associated with lower cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) assessed by maximal oxygen uptake during a treadmill test. Consistent with this view, our study reveals that a healthy cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) level, determined with Colombian cut-offs, is related to a lower prevalence of Normal weight obesity (NWO). Our present findings confirm the results of a previous systematic review suggesting that higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in childhood and adolescence is associated with lower body mass index (BMI) and body fatness [7].",67539568-5cb3-4f93-a8fe-5d744904283a
15,methods15," In a debate article [23], Carson [24] proposed a possible mechanism to link the development of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with the individual trajectories of adiposity and growth; the author suggested that vigorous exercise during the growing years, the type of physical activity that is strongly linked to cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) improvement, promotes the differentiation of stem cells into bone and muscle rather than into fat cells.  Interestingly, the differences between Normal weight obesity (NWO) and normal weight lean (NWL), particularly among girls, were attenuated and no longer significant for HDL-C and blood pressure upon adjustment for body mass index (BMI), indicating that Normal weight obesity (NWO) status may specifically affect cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) beyond body mass index (BMI) (Table 2).",4121ff80-ec8e-49f2-af15-faf3368fd09e
16,methods16," Importantly, although the current study focused on the Normal weight obesity (NWO) in children and adolescents, this may not necessarily mean that the established health risks of HDL-C and blood pressure can be neglected. Therefore, the present analysis should be reproduced in a larger sample to validate whether in fact the paths are actually similar in both genders [25]. For this reason, given the potential influence of Normal weight obesity (NWO) on physical fitness, the findings of our study highlight the importance of considering body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) levels analysis [26] rather than only measuring body mass index (BMI) in future preventive studies and practices in a school setting.   Our study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design prevents us from establishing a causal relationship.",9faa6326-7611-458c-87c4-a689c934b878
17,methods17," Second, we predicted VO2 peak from a single field test, and standard testing methods with directly measured oxygen consumption are required to confirm our results. Thus, the current results should be interpreted with caution, since no direct measure of absolute VO2 peak was available in our study. Third, the study was performed only in Bogotá (Colombia) and therefore the relationships found in the present study need to be confirmed using a representative sample. Despite these limitations, the main strength of our study is that, to our knowledge, this is the largest research on the relationship between Normal weight obesity (NWO) and cardiometabolic risk in a population of Latin American children and adolescents. These data from adolescents aged 9–17.9 years complement the study published by Correa-Rodríguez et al. [25] on the use of the Normal weight obesity (NWO) in addition to body adiposity parameters in practice by general practitioners, teachers, and coaches in a school setting.",8c1d9684-6145-4d0c-a66b-42adfc8b407a
18,methods18," Furthermore, highly standardized procedures were developed within the FUPRECOL study to avoid measurement bias [11]. Additionally, statistical models were adjusted for several variables, including age, pubertal stage, and Mediterranean diet adherence.  5. Conclusions The present findings suggest associations between Normal weight obesity (NWO) and cardiometabolic and physical fitness parameters in Colombian youth with body mass index (BMI) within the normal range. Studies in child populations are important because if Normal weight obesity (NWO) is associated with metabolic imbalances at an early age, clinical evaluation should change and preventive public policy actions should be redrawn and begin earlier, to limit complications as Normal weight obesity (NWO) youth get older.",cdf26692-8da4-4b30-ac8f-8c48fdc42adf
19,methods19," Overall, these results indicate the importance of incorporating into routine clinical evaluation or even at school, other simple low-cost measures like skinfold thickness or bioelectrical impedance to evaluate excess body fat among schoolchildren. Future prospective studies on the current topic are therefore recommended. ",a9eed114-4048-425f-8cdf-59a460d18efc
