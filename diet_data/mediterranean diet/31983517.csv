0,methods0,"2.1. Design and Subjects A cross-sectional survey was conducted on an initial cohort of 150 children from 6–12-year-old schoolchildren in primary education in the province of Avila (central Spain), during the 2018–2019 academic year. Of these 150 schoolchildren, 15 did not submit informed consent and 5 delivered an incomplete questionnaire, so it was decided to exclude them from the study. Thus, the final cohort consisted of 130 children (47% female). The children were selected at random in two schools, one public and one private, both located in different areas of the province where families of medium socioeconomic status live. The following exclusion criteria were applied: serious illness that influences nutritional status; mental limitation of parents and/or children who may make it difficult to complete the questionnaire.  The study protocols followed the Declaration of Helsinki ethical standards and all procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ávila Province (ref.",7ff74a97-068b-4681-a6d0-5feb6038edc4
1,methods1," GASAV 2020/13). All parents were informed of the purpose of the study and informed consent was obtained by each participating child, which was signed by children and parents.  2.2. Questionnaire The questionnaire, anonymous and self-filled, was structured into three parts: (1) Sociodemographic data (course, birth date, sex), physical activity (type and number of hours), frequency with which children ate in fast-food restaurants. (2) Three 24 h recalls administered according to the European Food Safety Authority (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)) [32] validated in Spanish children [8,33,34,35], which included three non-consecutive days, two working days and one weekend or holiday. (3) Data on current use of food supplements, origin of the water that child drinks, as well as data on breastfeeding.  Trained researchers arranged an interview with the director of each school in which they were invited to participate in the study.",0325c3c9-c7bd-4d1e-89b3-117a89420ef4
2,methods2," Upon acceptance by the center, parents and/or guardians of children (hereinafter parents) were informed of the study and voluntary nature of their participation. Parents who decided to participate signed the informed consent along with the questionnaire. Parents were also trained to complete the questionnaire, using a photo album of portions for part 2, and were instructed to describe the amount of food and/or home measures (spoons, glasses, etc.). Parents were invited to allow children to actively participate in completing the questionnaire.  Homemade measures were transformed in grams according to the information contained in Spanish Food Composition Tables [36]. The amount of food was expressed in grams and servings. The size of the servings for this population group was considered according to the White Book on Child Nutrition in Spain [37].",b8393ce9-89ab-4926-9796-b803ae7f559c
3,methods3," Energy intake were assessed by the Valladolid Center for Endocrinology and Clinical Nutrition Research (IENVA) [38], applying the Spanish Food Composition Database (Base de Datos Española de Composición de Alimentos (BEDCA)] [39] and Spanish Food Composition Tables [36].  2.3. Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and Compliance with Dietary Reference Intake Adherence to MD was assessed by means of the Mediterranean Adequacy Index (Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI)) [12,40]. Foods were classified in 20 groups: the 18 initially established and, additionally, other dairies (i.e., whole yogurt, skimmed yogurt, dairy desserts, and creamy ice creams) and ready or prepared meals (i.e.",8e80f9a2-a94d-4581-ac2b-0d43b92a9c58

Monetary Cost of the Diet Food prices were obtained from the Household Consumption Database of the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [41]. The average cumulative prices (average price/kg) reported in the period September 2018 to September 2019 were chosen for the Autonomous Community of Castile and Leon to which the province of Avila belongs.",d9ad811c-ae0a-407a-be9a-efd36e6bca53
5,methods5," The economic cost of the diet was calculated by multiplying the amount in grams of the food consumed by each child by the corresponding price in grams and adding up the total amount for each participant. The total economic cost of the diet was calculated in €/day and in €/1000 kcal/day.  2.5. Statistics Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS v.25 for Windows, IBM Software Group, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to carry out the statistical analysis. A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was applied to assess the correct distribution of the data. Results were expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (standard error of the mean (SEM)). The different quintiles of the monetary cost of the diet were compared (€/day and €/1000 kcal/day) according to the sex and age (quartiles) of the participants. The statistical significance of the data was assessed by a one-way analysis of variance (a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)). A Bonferroni post hoc test was used to make multiple comparisons.",d514295d-1252-4654-b0e2-78db405e7536
6,methods6," The effect of the adherence to the MD on the monetary cost of the diet (€/day and €/1000 kcal/day) was analyzed by a receiver operating characteristic (receiver operating characteristic (ROC)) curve and area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)), and by a multivariate logistic regression according to monetary cost of the diet (dependent variable) and MD adherence (lower adherence: Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) ≤ mean; increased adherence: Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) > mean) as an independent variable after adjustments for sex (categorical variable), age, and total energy consumption (continuous variables) to control for potential confounding. Differences between working days and holidays were analyzed using Student t-test for related samples. The level of significance was considered at p < 0.05 for all statistics.  3.

7,methods7," No differences were registered between boys and girls relative to age, physical activity, fast-food frequency of consumption, food supplement consumption, and kind of consumed water.  The energy content of the schoolchildren’s diet was 1936.90 ± 39.626 kcal/day, with a lower energy intake on the weekend than on a daily basis (1584.89 ± 42.268; 2372.99 ± 58.449, respectively), with this difference being statistically significant (p < 0.001).  Figure 1 shows the histogram of Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) score achieved by the schoolchildren cohort. A mean of 0.87 ± 0.466 points was obtained. Around 68.5% of schoolchildren scored less or equal than 1, which would be equivalent to saying that most of the energy ingested came from foods less characteristic of MD. On the other hand, 29.2% of schoolchildren reached a score of 1.01–2, 1.5% scored 2.01–3.00, and in the remaining 0.8%, the score was 3.01–4.00. No significant differences were found between sexes.",6748f957-b009-4554-a0f3-ffc8e7101f23
8,methods8," There were also no statistically significant differences between weekend and daily Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) (p = 0.289).  The mean monetary cost of the diet was 3.57 ± 0.679 euros/day. When the cost was standardized to 1000 kcal, a mean of 1.93 ± 0.406 was obtained, with a higher cost in boys (3.68 ± 0.878 €/day and 1.97 ± 0.513 €/1000 kcal/day) than in girls (3.44 ± 0.103 €/day and 1.89 ± 0.642 €/1000 kcal/day), but without significant differences. The cost of diet on public holidays was higher than the daily cost, but without statistically significant differences (p (€/day) = 0.780; p (€/1000 kcal/day) = 0.780). When the cost of the diet was compared between age quartiles, Bonferroni’s post hoc test showed significant differences, with a maximum diet cost for age quartile 3 (4.069 ± 0.111 €/day and 2.22 €/1000 kcal/day), with differences between age groups (p < 0.001) (data not shown).",826979e4-5f80-4aed-9148-3bd8466ba38d
9,methods9,"  When sex was considered regarding the distribution of school cohort in the different quintiles of the monetary cost of the diet (Table 2), the highest percentage of girls was found in first quintile of the monetary cost of the diet (31.1% for €/day and €/1000 kcal/day). Among boys, the highest percentage was in the second quintile (29.0%) when the cost was €/day, whereas when that cost was standardized to €/1000 kcal/day, the highest percentage of boys was in the third quintile (26.1%). The differences between sexes within the same quintile were only significant for the third quintile of the monetary cost measured in €/day (p = 0.015). Differences between sexes were found when the totality of the monetary cost of the diet was assessed (€/day p = 0.002; €/1000 kcal/day p = 0.018); data not shown.  The percentage of the budget that schoolchildren earmarked for foods with low MD adherence (62.50 ± 0.95%) was higher than that earmarked for foods with high MD adherence (33.80 ± 1.00%); i.",383ad937-5cfe-481d-a968-0fb308544099

Figure 2 shows the association between the MD adherence and the monetary cost of the diet using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (monetary cost of diet above the mean (€/day > 3.57 and €/1000 kcal/day > 1.93; internal value = 1) vs. monetary cost of diet less than or equal to the mean (€/day ≤3.57 and €/1000 kcal/day ≤ 1.93; internal value = 0)). The area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) for €/day and €/1000 kcal/day represents 62.6% and 65.6%, respectively. According to area under the curve (AUC) values, adherence to MD is a moderate predictor of the monetary cost of the diet.",7fadb50b-6244-4b75-915b-ebde92999c9e
11,methods11,"  Table 3 shows the association of monetary cost of the diet and adherence to the Mediterranean diet, by means of a multivariate adjusted logistic regression (B, standard error, p (Wald), odds ratio and 95% CI) considering monetary cost of diet lower than mean (€/day ≤ 3.57 and €/1000 kcal/day ≤ 1.93; internal value = 0) as a reference value. After adjusting for possible confounders, considering children with lower adherence to MD (Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) ≤ 0.87) compared to those with higher adherence (Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) > 0.87), a higher cost of diet in schoolchildren was related to above-average Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) values [OR (€/day) = 1.640; 95%CI: 0.682; 3.944], but with no significant differences (p = 0.269). When the cost of the diet was standardized to 1000 kcal, the same direct relationship between the cost of the diet and the Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) was observed [OR (€/100 kcal/day) = 3.012; 95%CI: 1.291; 7.",36e5f0b7-f545-44c5-b118-3c93e4be08af

Discussion The main findings of this study are that there is a direct and significative association between MD adherence, as measured by Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI), and the monetary cost of the diet standardized to €/1000 kcal/day.",c4617a5b-97b9-46e0-ab10-167b3a28f1a5
13,methods13," Current results are in line with those obtained in previous studies carried out in 2–24-year-old Spanish population using the KIDMED index [31], and among Portuguese [42] and Swedish children [43,44] based on the KIDMED index and 2005 Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)), respectively. These previous studies pointed out that a positive and significant relationship was observed with the monetary cost of the diet (€/day and €/1000 kcal/day).  In a previous German children and adolescent cohort study [44], records ranked similarly to this current study, considering high-quality diet scores above median and low-quality scores below median and applying the Nutrient Quality Index (Nutrient Quality Index (NQI)) and the Healthy Nutrition Score for Kids and Youth (HuSKY). These authors reported no significant association in low-quality records, but the association was direct and significant in high-quality records [44].",0fa0f8cf-22a6-4e63-9d69-dbe7f226d607
14,methods14," In the current study, similar results were obtained because no significant association was found when the cost of the diet was analyzed at €/day, but the association was significant when the cost was standardized to €/1000 kcal/day, showing that assessment using absolute values (€/day) could mask the results and standardization is compulsive in this analysis. Furthermore, the availability of money that children have for their own expenses could also influence the results. Accordingly, a study conducted in 2019 on Northeastern Spanish children and adolescents found a negative association between the availability of money that the studied subjects had and adherence to MD [45].  All schoolchildren participating in the current study scored Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) below 5, which means low adherence to MD. Studies on adherence to MD previously conducted in children agree with those obtained in the current study.",07e030dd-25fa-453e-8d8e-2d6b216ea669
15,methods15," Thus, in 2014, most of children and adolescents in the Mediterranean region showed low adherence to the MD, increasing the intake of processed foods and saturated fats [46]. Similar conclusions were obtained in 2013 among rural and urban adolescents in Southern Spain [47], showing that most of the subjects had low–medium adherence to MD. In a 2009 study, most Cyprus children showed low adherence to MD [48]. In 2018, Northern Italian primary and secondary children and adolescents showed that poor adherence to MD was more prevalent in primary schools than in high schools [49], but Northeastern Spanish children showed worse adherence to MD among secondary schoolers [45]. Other previous studies found moderate–high adherence to MD in children and adolescents [31,42,43,50,51]. The adherence to MD was not different between boys and girls in the current study.",487dc834-cf24-4dbc-a13c-2113a6f7b3cb
16,methods16," Although there may be some mismatch previously [52]; most studies on the degree of adherence to MD in this population group did not show differences between sexes, except for slight variations [53].  The results of the current study show that the mean monetary cost of the diet was 3.57 ± 0.679 euros, and when the cost was standardized to €/1000 kcal/day, a mean of 1.93 ± 0.406 was obtained. These results are like those obtained in previous studies [31,42]. The monetary cost of the diet was higher in boys than in girls, results that match those obtained in the study carried out in the 2–24-year-old Spanish population [31]. Therefore, the current results show that studied children from Central Spain showed similar adherence to MD among other Mediterranean children. The reason why these Mediterranean children showed low adherence will need further assessment.",07ada883-67b2-4ff4-a3b0-91bc7f0b0c8b
17,methods17," Among the widest variety of foods present in the healthiest dietary patterns, some MD key foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and fish as well as healthier options like lean meats and low-fat products are usually associated with higher costs [15,42,43,54]. In the schoolchildren participating in the current study, consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish, and lean meats were much lower than the recommendations, which are in line with the low adherence to MD using a low part of their budget to the consumption of these foods.  When analyzing MD from a cost perspective, it is important to note that not all foods with high nutrient density have a high cost; so, it is possible to design a diet following the Mediterranean dietary pattern using the lowest monetary cost options in each food group.",b3fd5580-65cf-4ee1-9108-18c5a44862ba
18,methods18," Accordingly, it is important to point out that in the area in which the current study has been developed, the proximity market is common, and many families have their own orchards; so, it would be possible to follow up on a healthier dietary pattern than currently observed. Therefore, it will be desirable to design nutrition education programs that insist on these aspects. Future research is needed to obtain greater validation of MD indexes in terms of consistency and reproducibility. Cohort and intervention studies should assess further MD associations with behavioral and health factors.  5. Strengths and Limitations The current study provides insights into the monetary costs of the diet and its association with adherence to MD, an issue that is becoming relevant in public health worldwide due to the current economic crisis in many Mediterranean countries along with the need to design nutrition education programs that integrate healthy diet designs with more cost-effective options.",f5a74a32-ef07-4b2f-99f5-8cad715d1903
19,methods19,"  The main limitation of the current study is that the low adherence to MD found in schoolchildren did not allow benchmarking on the cost of the diet for wider ranges of Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) scores. However, the categorization of the sample in two groups according to the Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) score obtained has allowed a real analysis of the schoolchildren. Another limitation was the validity and reliability of dietary consumption data from surveys, being well known for the potential for bias [55,56]. In studies aimed at children, this becomes more relevant as they have a greater difficulty in estimating the amount of consumed food, and in the case of surveys being conducted on parents, they have a limited ability to assess all eaten foods outside the family environment.",5b23d262-bb1c-4394-8435-c77d2ff42309
20,methods20," There is evidence that the combined use of different methods of evaluating dietary intake (quantitative and non-quantitative questionnaires) with biomarkers, and integrated with statistical models, can give more accurate estimates of the usual individual intake [57,58]. The current study used a journal or dietary record used and validated in Spanish children [8,33,34,35]. In addition, parents were previously trained and quality control was followed to minimize bias. Finally, the design of the study is cross-sectional, providing evidence of association, but not causal relationships.  6. Conclusions In a cohort of Spanish schoolchildren with low adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a higher cost of the diet standardized to 1000 kcal was associated with above-average Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) values.
