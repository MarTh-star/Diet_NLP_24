0,methods0,"2.1. Participants and Design A non-experimental, descriptive and cross-sectional study was carried out with a single measurement in a single group. The sample consisted of a total of 515 students enrolled in the 2017–2018 course with age range between 18 and 28 years old (x¯ = 21.58, SD = 2.72), where a 50.8 % (n = 262) were men and a 49.2% (n = 253) were women. The sample selection was done by convenience, using as selection criteria: (a) to be enrolled in some university degree of Educational Sciences during the academic year of 2017–2018; (b) be younger than 30. The exclusion criteria were: (a) not suffer any pathology that prevents the established scales being fulfilled.   2.2. Measures The main instruments used in this research were: Test of Adherence to Mediterranean Diet (KIDMED) [6]. This sale is composed by 16 dichotomous items with an affirmative or negative response; e.g.: “You eat fresh or cooked vegetables every day”, which refer to patterns related to the MD.",5ce4f6ec-31ac-4505-91d2-bd02b9da7092
1,methods1," Four of these items have negative connotations (−1), whereas the other 12 are positively valued (+1), ranging from the final score of −4 to +12. The final score is divided into three groups in order to obtain the level of adherence to MD. This scale scored an internal consistency of α = 0.812.  Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A). This was validated by Kowalski et al. [31] and translated into Spanish by Martínez-Gómez et al. [32]. This questionnaire establishes the level of PA practiced as well as the type of PA engaged in during the last seven days. This scale allows us to obtain a summation through 10 items punctuated by a 5-point Likert scale; e.g. “In the last 7 days. What did you usually do at lunchtime (before and after eating)”. For this questionnaire, the reliability got a Cronbach’s alpha of α = 0.875.  Body weight (kg) was established by means of electronic weighing scale, using the model Tanita TBF300®.",3082fe4e-9d8a-48e4-a90c-8f438d2fe45f
2,methods2," This model needs gender, age and height variables, measuring this last one by means of a stadiometer Holtain LTD® and following the protocol established by Portao et al. [33].  Scale of Academic Stress. This instrument was validated by García-Ros et al. [34] in Spanish university students. For this questionnaire, the level of academic stress is assessed using 21 items which are scored with a 5-points Likert scale: e.g., “I feel stressed when I do exhibition of works in class”. Stress is grouped into four dimensions according to this instrument, which are: Academic obligations (items 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 14 and 15), Academic marks and future expectations (items 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21), Interpersonal difficulties (items 8, 12 and 13) and Communication of own ideas (items 2, 3 and 4). For this instrument, a Cronbach’s alpha of α = 0.889 was obtained, this being acceptable.    2.3.",507905bd-816f-47c6-9ac4-248c04dc624f
3,methods3," Procedure The collaboration of university centres was requested through an informative letter elaborated by the Area of Corporal Expression of the University of Granada. Furthermore, the written and informed consent of the respondents was requested through a document in which the nature of the study was detailed. The data was collected during regular classes in the different university campus. Different research assistants were present in the data collection in order to ensure that questionnaires were properly completed, as well as to provide guidance for the scale application and to answer different questions from respondents. Furthermore, participants did not receive any incentives. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Granada with code “641/CEIH/2018.”  2.4. Data Analysis The data analysis was undertaken using the software IBM SPSS® 22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).",c2237d5b-e321-4fc2-bfc8-803a4273e086
4,methods4," First, frequencies and medians were used for basic descriptors, whereas the association between the variables detailed were analysed using the t-test and analysis of variance (and analysis of variance (ANOVA)) depending on the number of categories of each variable. In addition, a regression analysis is developed in order to control the relationship between each variable. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov’s test was used in order to check the normality of data. Levene’s test was employed in order to check homoscedasticity. Finally, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used to analyse the reliability of the scales used, establishing the reliability index at 95.5%.  3. Results Table 1 shows the levels of global academic stress, as well as the levels of the different types of academic stress according to the sex of the respondents.",26a75e8a-dc7b-493e-8cfe-ecab4ca3a2c4
5,methods5," Women show higher levels of stress in all the dimensions measured, but two of them (Academic Marks and Future Expectations, and Interpersonal Difficulties) did not present significant differences between sexes. The greatest differences were observed in the academic obligations (3.29 ± 0.86 vs. 2.93 ± 0.95) and the communication of ideas (2.69 ± 0.94 vs. 2.26 ± 0.76), with women obtaining higher average scores. Regarding global academic stress, women presented an average of 59.62 ± 15.02 and men a score of 53.57 ± 13.82.  Table 2 indicates the levels of global stress and the different types of academic stress according to the body mass index (BMI) of the respondents. It is observed how significant differences were found in the dimensions “Academic Obligations” (p = 0.034), and “Communication of own ideas” (p = 0.037).",07338419-c915-4608-a3bc-9c45c8b58d76
6,methods6," Thus, it can be observed how those who had a normal body mass index (BMI) were those who had less stress in all the variables, and those who had a low weight or obesity were those who had greater stress in academic obligations (2.99 ± 0.86 vs. 4.03 ± 0.74) and global stress (54.82 ± 14.19 vs. 71.00 ± 11.51).  Table 3 shows the levels of global academic stress as well as the different types of academic stress according to the level of adherence to the MD of the university students. Only significant differences were found for the dimension “Communication of own ideas” (p = 0.045). It is observed how in this variable the stress level decreases as the adherence to the MD is improved (3.66 ± 0.46 vs. 2.32 ± 0.82). This tendency for stress is also observed in the variables “Academic marks and future expectations” and “Global stress”, although no statistically significant differences have been obtained.",ce0ac52c-d486-48cc-b79d-305d2d2e8688
7,methods7,"  Table 4 shows the global stress levels as well as the different types of academic stress according to the level of PA practice of the respondents. No significant differences were found for any of the dimensions. In the variables “Academic Obligations” and “Global Stresss” there were hardly any differences between groups, being the groups with a medium level of PA practice those that suffered more stress.  Next, the bivariate correlations between the variables under study are shown (Table 5). A positive relationship can be observed between age and body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.05, r = 0.217), as well as a negative relationship between age and stress linked to future expectations (p < 0.01, r = −0.306). Likewise, it was revealed that body mass index (BMI) was positively related to global stress (p < 0.05, r = 0.185) and stress associated with academic obligations (p < 0.05; r = 0.198), while diet was negatively related to stress linked to the communication of own ideas (p < 0.01, r = −0.",569f7f5c-9bdc-480f-8814-a6a28ae36e09
8,methods8,"261). Finally, note that no relationship was found with the PA and that all stress dimensions were positively related between them, showing a medium-high correlation strength.  For the regression model developed (Table 6), the R2 showed a value of 0.383, which explains 38.3% of the variability of academic stress that constitutes the dependent variable. In addition, a positive value is obtained, presupposing a direct relationship between the variables. It can be established that the model is valid since F = 4.068 and p = 0.002, so the null hypothesis is rejected and it is concluded that the linear dependence is statistically significant, so the model is adequate. Analysing the variables that constitute the model, significant differences were observed for sex (p = 0.003) and body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.002). In the case of sex, an inverse relationship is shown (b = −0.285) which determines higher stress levels in women.",ce7ffccb-82eb-4d7f-a83d-c0313d97ccf0
9,methods9," For the body mass index (BMI) a positive relationship is shown (b = 0.286), specifying that higher stress levels are associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and weight problems. Likewise, it is observed that when sex and body mass index (BMI) variables are controlled, no significant relationships of stress with diet and BP are observed.  4. Discussion The present research aimed to analyse the associations between academic stress, sex and different healthy habits, such as the level of adherence to the MD and the level of practice of PA. Likewise, the body mass index (BMI) is included in order to contrast how this relates to the stress experienced by university students of educational sciences. In this way, some studies with a similar line, both in the national and international context, are those carried out by Tehrani et al. [35], Shafiei et al. [36], Vaquero et al. [37] or Beiter et al. [38].",d1f93417-64dc-4da1-a6c6-5d2cfdbc8524
10,methods10," In all of them, the relevance of considering healthy habits for the improvement of academic stress is shown.  The level of global academic stress was medium, observing the highest scores in the academic obligations, while the lowers scores were associated with personal difficulties. García-Ros et al. [34] presented similar results, although the interpersonal difficulties were slightly higher in this case. Considering the relationships between academic stress and the sex of the university students, women showed higher scores in the global factor and for the dimensions “academic obligations” and “communication of own ideas”. These findings could be justified by the premises identified by Yang et al. [39], who establish that women have a higher vocational level towards this degree, making them have a greater critical thinking and that they are more susceptible to the characteristics of the environment.",39ea082d-16aa-49f4-8a6e-6d3abb550928
11,methods11," In addition, they obtained the highest scores in this dimension, as indicated by recent international studies which show the superiority of womens’ performance which is associated with the level of implication and stress generated [40,41,42].  Considering the relationship between the level of academic stress and the categorization of the body mass index (BMI), significant differences were observed for academic obligations and the expression and communication of their own ideas. Specifically, it could be observed that individuals with obesity had the highest score for academic stress. According to Kerr-Gaffney et al. [43] and Krafchek et al. [44], this could be due to the anxiety linked to this stressful situation, which would modify the eating patterns, which can be associated with weight status. Specifically, states of anxiety will activate the sympathetic system, accelerating metabolism and altering appetite [45].",4fab37db-21ce-43aa-9318-557ffb8a3bf7
12,methods12," In addition, long-term stress states can be linked to higher food intakes, which could be justified by alterations of the hypothalamus in the production of neurotransmitters to control appetite [46].  In the present study, lower levels of academic stress were observed in those respondents who followed a diet of better quality, although only statistically significant differences were shown for the dimension related to the communication of their own ideas. At this point, it is of interest to highlight two points associated with the importance of eating habits, considering therapeutic and preventive visions. First, to follow a balanced diet could help reduce levels of stress, since the body will have the essential nutrients and this will help to prevent imbalances in the production of neurotransmitters that could facilitate states of anxiety [47,48]. Second, Bektaş et al.",ba14daab-0ad6-4321-a2c8-04518c6251c5
13,methods13," [47] states that it may be the stress situation itself that leads to non-adaptive behaviors linked to the intake of unhealthy foods. Therefore, interest in acting according to the academic context in order to develop flexible methodologies and learning strategies that reduce stress levels should be highlighted [49]. Nevertheless, the subsequent regression model tested the relationship between all variables, controlling for the effect of sex and body mass index (BMI). In this case, no significant differences were obtained between academic stress and diet, showing different results than those obtained by Bektas et al. [47].   The different dimensions of academic stress have not been related to the practice of PA. Nevertheless, several research studies have shown an inverse relationship between both variables. In fact, Jones et al. [23] and Holmes et al. [50] highlighted the levels of anxiety and stress decreasing when people practice physical activity.",31f51421-9cd7-4754-b75a-dad822acdaaf
14,methods14," This is because the practice of PA helps decrease energy levels giving an outlet to frustration and decreasing muscle tensions [51]. It also increases the levels of endorphins—the happiness hormone—and cortisol and norepinephrine levels which are linked to stress and anxiety [52]. In addition, we have shown that exercise helps to improve depressive states and manage complex emotional processes [53].  The main limitations of this study are presented below. In the first place, it is worth mentioning the study design as a limitation, which is descriptive and cross-sectional, so that cause–effect relationships cannot be established. Likewise, it is interesting to point out the total number of respondents, since the sample has not been representative despite the fact that a large number of subjects is collected. The use of body mass index (BMI) as a health indicator could be highlighted, being of greater interest the use of body composition such as fat mass and lean mass.",2878ca25-122f-4c09-aea5-515ad296eca7
15,methods15," However, the most important limitation of this study is that it has not controlled some variables that can influence stress levels, such as household income or health level. As future perspectives, it would be interesting to replicate the study in a representative sample of Spanish university students. In addition, the use of a bioimpedance scale is suggested to obtain reliable body mass index (BMI) values and the respective values for body composition. Furthermore, using devices for the control of physical activity would be a very important addition in terms of collecting data, since it would obtain more reliable values of the activity level of the subjects.  5. Conclusions In relation to the established hypotheses, it was observed that hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 were fulfilled, while hypothesis 3 was not satisfied. Thus, this research presents as main conclusions a medium-high level of stress in university students of educational sciences.",5fe9d8ca-ac7b-4c39-af59-31e01e200cea
16,methods16," Specifically, women show higher levels of stress linked to academic obligations and having to communicate their own ideas. Likewise, it has been observed that having high levels of stress is associated with weight problems, especially linked to obesity states. Finally, it was observed that young people who had greater adherence to MD had lower levels of stress, without finding statistically significant differences in relation to the practice of PA. Nevertheless, the subsequent regression model tested the relationship between all variables controlling for the effect of sex and body mass index (BMI). In this case, no significant differences were obtained between academic stress and diet.  Author Contributions R.C.-C., F.Z.-O. and M.C.-S. conceived the hypothesis of this study.
