These epidermal barrier function parameters were measured by a Multi Probe Adapter (MPA, Courage + Khazaka electronic GmbH, Mirocaya, Bilbao, Spain). All variables were measured ten times, using their average for analysis.  Parameters related to sleep quality were also collected.",a94d609d-28db-45e0-b96e-f9263c7dcd68
3,methods3," The Apnea-Hypopnea Index (Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI)) was evaluated by a Cardio-Respiratory Polygraphy in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients, and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)) was collected in healthy subjects. A STOP-Bang questionnaire was used as inclusion criteria for selecting healthy individuals without Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS). This is a screening tool to evaluate Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) risk in healthy subjects that has been validated on the Spanish population [22]. It consists of 8 items: snoring, tiredness, observed apnea, Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)), age, neck circumference, and male gender. Healthy volunteers who scored three or more positive responses were considered as having moderate or high risk of suffering Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and were excluded from the study [23].",c6443e86-2b87-4b5b-a18a-f1c40602f886
4,methods4," The Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) is the number of apnea or hypopnea that occur per hour of sleep. The Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) allowed us to classify Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients into three groups: mild (5–14.9 apnea/h), moderate (15–29.9 apnea/h), and severe (≥30 apnea/h) [21]. Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire, validated in the Spanish population, which evaluates people’s sleep quality. It consists of 7 sleep components: duration, disturbances, latency, daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness, efficiency, subjective sleep quality, and medications needed for sleep. Those who scored ≤5 are considered as good sleepers and those >5 as poor sleepers [25].  The diet was evaluated by the Adherence to Mediterranean Diet questionnaire. It consists of 14 items about the frequency of consumption of different foods frequently consumed in the Mediterranean Diet.",22a3c91f-940b-4ab5-ab35-69ae19379be8
5,methods5," Scores ≥9 were considered as good adherence to Mediterranean Diet and scores <9 as poor adherence [26].  Anxiety and Depression was assessed using The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), validated on the Spanish population. The questionnaire consists of 14 items and is divided into two subscales with 7 items each. Scores ≥8 on each subscale were considered indicative of anxiety or depression [27]. The Perceived Stress Scale (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), validated on the Spanish population, was used to evaluate the stress degree. It is a self-assessment questionnaire with 14 items. A higher score indicates a higher level of perceived stress [28].  2.4. Statistical Analysis  Descriptive statistics were used to present the characteristics of the sample. Continuous variables were expressed as the mean and standard deviation (SD).",11951893-2c05-403a-9ecb-3b72f213581d

7,methods7," Ethics  The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain (Impacto de factores del exposoma en la homeostasis y función barrera cutánea, protocol code SH01). The nature of the study was explained to all the participants, who agreed to participate and signed the informed consent form. All measurements were non-invasive, and patient data were kept confidential.  3. Results  3.1. Subject Characteristics  The study included 86 participants, 56 patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and 30 healthy individuals. Participants’ sociodemographic characteristics are presented in Table 1. The mean age was 48.87 (11.63 SD) years, and the proportion of men was higher in both groups. Most patients (67.4%, 58/86) had skin phototype III. Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients had significantly higher weight (95.86 vs. 87.42 kg, p < 0.",a25ade63-4fc8-4c92-9f36-393e50f00640

Healthy subjects used significantly less sun lotion than Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients (16.7% vs. 60.7%, p < 0.001).  3.2. Skin Barrier Function between Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and Healthy Individual  The epidermal barrier function parameters in healthy individuals and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients were compared (Figure 1 and Table 2). Erythema was higher in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients than in healthy individual (244.34 AU vs. 227.48 AU; p = 0.221). transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was also higher in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients than in healthy individuals (8.01 vs. 8.68 g·m−2·h−1; p = 0.414). The temperature, pH, and elasticity were similar between both groups.",1f05218f-1c9e-49aa-9363-c77ac17b10b4

Moreover, Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients had significantly higher levels of anxiety (9.27 vs. 6.47 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)-A score; p = 0.008) and depression (7.07 vs. 3.83; p = 0.001 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)-D score) than healthy individuals. Perceived stress was also almost significantly higher in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) (25.29 vs. 20.7 Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score; p = 0.058).  The impact of exposome factors on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was also evaluated, as seen in Table 5. Concerning sleep quality according to Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), 60% (18/30) of healthy individuals and 96.4% (52/56) of patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) were classified as poor sleepers (scores ≥5 in Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)).",802f4859-5b41-4c2e-94d0-91ffc2eab153

Discussion  Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) may have skin barrier impairment reflected in higher transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values. Moreover, more severe patients could also develop greater skin damage.",ebcc976a-bebb-428e-9717-ebaa9700424c
14,methods14," Higher levels of anxiety, depression and stress, and lower adherence to a Mediterranean Diet have been found in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which might also impact skin barrier function.  The impact of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) on skin homeostasis and epidermal barrier function has not been evaluated previously. Some studies have assessed the effect of sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality on the skin. A cross-sectional study that included 42 healthy individuals showed that transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was related to sleep efficiency [29]. Sleep restriction during one night increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and decreased hydration and elasticity in 24 healthy females [30]. Moreover, sleep deprivation to 4 h per night increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and desquamation, and decreased stratum corneum hydration (SCH) and elasticity in 32 healthy women [31].",0e5d4618-a1bb-43de-8d66-c60b7c33925f
15,methods15," External factors related to poor sleep quality, such as smartphone usage, also impair skin by decreasing hydration and elasticity [32]. In agreement with our results, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is increased by sleep disturbances. Nevertheless, we did not observe that stratum corneum hydration (SCH) or elasticity were impaired in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients. This could be explained because in our population, patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) use moisturizing more frequently, which might present a bias for the sleep impact on skin barrier. Our study also observed that patients with a more severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) disease could have greater skin impairment, reflected in higher transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values.",c3595e7b-df7f-46de-9b0e-ea4733a93b0a
16,methods16," This may be explained because severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients have a long disease duration with poor sleep quality [14] and it has been previously observed that longer sleep deprivation is also associated with higher transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values [31,32].  The relationship between sleep disorders and skin damage may be due to an interaction between the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis (Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal axis (HPA)) and the immune system [33,34]. Low sleep quality deregulates the Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal axis (HPA) axis, leading to increased glucocorticoid levels that damage the lamellar bodies and impair stratum corneum cohesion [33]. Sleep disturbances may also increase the inflammatory cytokines levels, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and NK cell activity, and alter collagen fibers synthesis and degradation [34].",3ed558ba-5be6-4271-a08f-6b881c6931d4
17,methods17,"  Body temperature follows a 24-h rhythm, and a bidirectional relationship between sleep and skin temperature has been proposed [35]. The relationship between skin temperature and sleep could be explained by a homeostatic hourglass mechanism, as sleep propensity increases skin blood flow and thus skin temperature; a circadian clock mechanism, as circulating melatonin results in peripheral vasodilation increasing skin temperature; and a set of sleep-permissive factors (dark lit environment, being safe or feeling well) related to higher skin temperature and wake-promoting conditions (brightly lit environment, being in danger or feeling pain) associated with lower skin temperature. All these facts suggest that skin temperature increase with sleep propensity. So, sleep deprivation and insomnia could be related to higher skin temperature [35]. Moreover, it has been proposed that temperature manipulation could even improve sleep quality [35].",78a8f0cd-f7df-4ccd-a7af-c2ab69f18319
18,methods18," For example, the impact of continuous skin-to-skin contact, a temperature-based method of care in the neonatal intensive care unit to minimize separation between parents and infants, on sleep quality and mood in parents of preterm infants is being evaluated [36].  The impact of the diet on skin barrier function remains controversial. In our population, the Adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, rich in vegetables, legumes, and olive oil [26] might not have a great impact on skin, in agreement with other research that found no relation between the dietary intake and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) [29]. Other research showed that a high intake of vegetables, legumes, and olive oil, and a low intake of meat and butter, was associated with skin wrinkling in a sun-exposed site [37]. It has also been observed that α-linolenic from vegetable oils, but not from dairy products, is a protective factor for photoaging [38]. Serum vitamin A was related to low skin sebum content and surface pH [39].",f96a27b7-3348-4a60-9676-46e7e22f4bba
19,methods19," Further research is needed to know how different alimentary patterns could impact on skin barrier function.  Regarding the impact of stress, anxiety, and depression on skin barrier function, a recent review showed that stress, anxiety, and depression, and situations associated with these conditions (crowding, isolation, social and marital stress) were correlated to skin impairment [40]. It should be also considered that skin dysfunction and mental disorders are influenced by socioeconomic status through social capital and socioeconomic position. A poor socioeconomic status is associated with worse sleep parameters, reflected in lower sleep time, longer sleep latency, and greater sleep fragmentation [41], and with high anxiety and depression levels [42]. Moreover, depression has been related to facial ageing [43] and its treatment with escitalopram showed skin hydration improvement in depressed patients [44].",f28e95af-2a24-4efd-bc1c-363e73fdc546
20,methods20,"  This study was subject to several limitations: (1) the limited sample size, as most results are not statistically significant, (2) the lack of follow-up period, and (3) the impossibility to measure skin barrier function immediately after sleep. Future research that assesses skin barrier function parameters in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) before and after several months of continuous positive airway pressure (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) treatment could demonstrate if the sleep improvement is also associated with skin recovery.  5. Conclusions  Severe patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) may have skin barrier impairment reflected in higher transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values. Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) also have high levels of anxiety, depression, and stress, and lower adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, exposome factors that also impair skin barrier function.",5fc8843d-0309-4de1-b427-f62b3d51e1ce
21,methods21," Further studies are needed to verify the impact of diet and sleep quality on epidermal barrier function. The first approach to objectively measure the impact of sleep deprivation on skin barrier function would be to evaluate healthy individuals after a 8 h of sleep and after a non-sleep night. It would be also interesting that patients diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, or other sleep disturbances would be measured with objective parameters including transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum hydration (SCH) at the time of the diagnosis and three months after the treatment to assess how sleep quality improvement impacts skin barrier function. Moreover, skin care routines, including emollients and a healthy diet, could be also implemented in these patients to assess the impact on their disease and their skin.",467c0ce1-6980-4e38-ad25-f61506752fd7
