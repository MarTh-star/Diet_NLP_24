0,methods0," We conducted a non-systematic review of English articles published from 1964 to September 2021. The search terms were: (“dietary patterns” OR “diet”) AND/OR (“erectile dysfunction”) AND/OR (“benign prostatic hyperplasia”).  3. Erectile Dysfunction  In recent years, interest in the quality of food has grown, paying attention not only to the individual food, but also to the micronutrients contained in the food [13,14].  3.1. Studies in Animal Models  In recent years, there have been important advances in the study of the molecular pathways that regulate the association between diet, exercise, and endothelial function in the penis. Authors have demonstrated that pigs fed with a high-fat diet had significantly reduced cGMP levels, an increase in eNOS uncoupling, and eNOS binding to caveolin-1 (indicating reduced NO availability) in the penis of sedentary pigs. They also reported that exercise of pigs counteracted these abnormalities [15].",106a3694-7d61-4514-b95e-a40ab5c226ee
1,methods1,"  These data demonstrated that unhealthy diets determine a detrimental impact in endothelial cells by the increase in oxidative stress and significant reduction in nitric oxide, an essential molecule that maintains erectile function [16].  Akomolafe et al. evaluated the effect of a diet supplemented with raw and toasted pumpkin seeds on some key biochemical parameters relevant to erectile function in the body cavernous tissues of male rats. Animals were divided into six groups (10 animals per group) for the evaluation of adenosine deaminase (animals per group) for the evaluation of adenosine deaminase (ADA)), phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5), arginase, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, including nitric oxide level and malondialdehyde (malondialdehyde (MDA)).",8b1ebca3-b767-4038-8775-eeb7ebffc9a5
2,methods2," Group I: normal control rats fed with a basal diet; Groups II and III: (5% and 10% pumpkin seeds [PS]) rats fed with diet supplemented with 5% and 10% raw pumpkin seeds, respectively; Groups IV and V: (5% and 10% roasted pumpkin seeds [PS]) rats fed with diet supplemented with 5% and 10% roasted pumpkin seeds, respectively; Group VI: rats treated with Sildenafil citrate (5 mg/kg). The diet supplemented with roasted pumpkin seeds showed better PDE-5, animals per group) for the evaluation of adenosine deaminase (ADA), and arginase activities, as well as NO and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. No significant differences were observed in the AChE activities of rats treated with raw and roasted pumpkin seeds. The authors concluded that the modulatory effects of raw and roasted pumpkin seeds on enzymes associated with erectile dysfunction suggest the biochemical rationale for their therapeutic role in improving erectile function.",d2c87fb8-f92e-48db-bf19-f8761fbfc15f
3,methods3," However, it appears that roasted pumpkin seeds (10%, w/w of the diet) have more beneficial effects than raw seeds [17]. In addition, a 2016 study by Akomolafe revealed that pumpkin seeds contain phenolic acids and flavonoids and prevent oxidative damage to testicular tissues [18].  Recent studies have suggested that the treatment of ED may benefit from the modulation of other enzymes such as ectonucleotidases (E-NTPDase) and animals per group) for the evaluation of adenosine deaminase (ADA) [19,20,21], which are involved in the regulation of biomolecules such as cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate), NO (nitrogen oxide), ATP, and adenosine that are involved in penile erection [22,23].  In a study conducted in rats with ED, the authors investigated the effects of quercetin as a promising source of dietary phytochemicals for ED management.",9cb1f7cd-9394-48ad-9369-82fd05559540
4,methods4,"  The authors divided the rats into different groups by the administration of normal saline, cyclosporine-induced hypertension, rats administered with sildenafil (5 mg kg−1 day−1), and rats administered quercetin 25 mg kg−1 day−1 or Q 50 mg kg−1 day−1 (50 Q). They demonstrated that quercetin improved the activities of enzymes associated with better ATP bioavailability (E-NTPDase and 5′-nucleotidase). Its effects were able to decrease animals per group) for the evaluation of adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity and increase NO levels [24].  These findings highlighted the concept that polyphenols are phytochemicals and can promote good health and improved erectile dysfunction [25].  3.2. Studies in Humans  The importance of diet on ED arises from the assumption that this pathology is often the first symptom of coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) [9,26,27]. In fact, the pathophysiology of ED is similar to that of atherosclerosis [28,29].",5fb87474-545e-4d73-b334-367030a70318
5,methods5," The correlation between diet and diseases of the cardiovascular system has been known for years [1]. Therefore, a possible correlation between erectile dysfunction and dietary factors is conceivable.  In the study by Nicolosi et al., it is shown that 31.8% of men with a below-average level of physical activity demonstrate ED, compared to 17.5% of men with an average activity level and only 13.9% of men who have an above-average level of physical activity, thus demonstrating a linear association between the level of physical activity and ED [30].  Lu et al. recently studied the relationship between a plant-based diet and erectile dysfunction in 184 Chinese patients. The ED group (92 subjects) and the free ED group (92 subjects) were similar in terms of baseline characteristics (p > 0.05), with the exception of lifestyle (p < 0.05).",a8f2557e-0e7f-4520-a456-6991b2d85629
6,methods6," The plant diet index (plant diet index (PDI)) and the healthy plant diet index (hplant diet index (PDI)) in the ED group were significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.001). Adjusted multivariate analysis indicated that the presence of ED was negatively associated with nitric oxide, plant diet index (PDI), and hplant diet index (PDI) levels (all p < 0.05) and was positively related to body mass index, metabolic syndrome and E-selectin levels. Additionally, both plant diet index (PDI) and hplant diet index (PDI) significantly increased with increasing International Erectile Function Index (International Erectile Function Index (IIEF)-5) scores within the ED group (p < 0.05). Finally, multimodal multivariate analysis was performed, which indicated the robustness of the results [31].",7ed2122a-0035-42fc-a562-34b0fd52faf7
7,methods7,"  From previous studies, we know that ED is less frequent in patients who adhere to the Mediterranean diet model, characterized by the prevalent presence of fish, vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and nuts, compared to those who mainly consumed a diet containing red and processed meats and refined cereals [16,32].  Giugliano et al. assessed the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and sexual function among 555 men with type 2 diabetes, showing that men with the highest scores of adherences to the Mediterranean diet had lower overall prevalence of erectile dysfunction. Additionally, men in the middle and highest tertiles had a lower prevalence of severe ED compared to men in the lowest adhesion tertile [33].  Sticking to an unhealthy diet pattern can cause early endothelial damage through oxidative stress, which results in a reduction in the availability of nitric oxide, indispensable in the physiology of erection [34].",bf2d777c-8cd0-4d1c-8b09-e62b81d93d7e
8,methods8,"  Food antioxidants have been shown to improve erectile dysfunction in men. A rich source of polyphenols is represented by the standardized French maritime pine bark (Pinus pinaster) Pycnogenol (Pycnogenol (PYC)) extract. The main constituent of the polyphenols in Pycnogenol (PYC) is made up of 70% procyanidins. Pycnogenol (PYC) has significant antioxidant and multiple power biomodulatory effects, such as transcription factor inhibition NF-κB, cyclooxygenase, NO stimulation of the hypertensive effect by inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme, antimutagen effects, and alleviation of allergic and anti-glycemic asthma symptoms. Trebaticky enrolled 53 patients with ED who were divided into two groups (32 with diabetes mellitus, 21 non-diabetes mellitus) in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study.",e3dfc094-e21f-4f4d-b653-755d6a08601c
9,methods9," During the 3-month intervention with Pycnogenol or placebo and one month after the end of the intervention, the patients were investigated for ED with a validated International Index of Erectile Function-5 (International Erectile Function Index (IIEF)-5) questionnaire. Lipid profile and blood glucose were analyzed in each group. The results showed that of the natural polyphenols extracted, Pycnogenol improved erectile function in the DM group by 45% compared to the NDM group, where the improvement was also significant, but only 22%. The levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and glucose were lowered by Pycnogenol in patients with DM. Glucose level was not affected by Pycnogenol in non-DMs. The placebo showed no effect on the monitored parameters in both groups [35].  In a recent study, Salas-Huetos et al. (2019) reported that the consumption of walnuts increased sexual function.",f077c652-4375-47c0-afa4-40ff791e17b6
10,methods10," Indeed, a secondary outcome analysis of the FERTINUTS study, a 14-week randomized controlled trial with 83 subjects consuming a Western-style diet, reported that consuming 60 g/day of nuts was associated with increased orgasmic function and sexual desire compared with the control group (avoiding nuts), but no significant differences in erectile function were observed [36].  Previously, Mykoniatis et al. enrolled 350 adult men who were asked to complete an anonymous web-based questionnaire. Erectile dysfunction was diagnosed with the International Erectile Function Index (International Erectile Function Index (IIEF)) and flavonoid intake was recorded using food-frequency questionnaires, with a focus on flavonoid-rich foods such as coffee, fruit, etc.",420e0894-6e94-45df-962d-df24a8a6f128
11,methods11," Participants were divided into two groups based on the International Erectile Function Index (IIEF) scores: control group without ED (International Erectile Function Index (IIEF) score 26; n = 264) and the case group with ED (International Erectile Function Index (IIEF) score < 26; n = 86). Men with erectile dysfunction reported a lower median monthly intake of total flavonoids (p < 0.001) and all flavonoid subclasses (p < 0.001) than the controls. Adjusting the intake for age and body mass index, it was found that the consumption of 50 mg/day of flavonoids reduced the risk of erectile dysfunction by 32% (odds ratio = 0.68, p < 0.001). Of all the flavonoids recorded, flavones appeared to contribute the most to healthy erectile function. Controls reported higher consumption of fruit and vegetables, lower consumption of dairy products and alcoholic beverages, and less intense smoking than the cases (p < 0.001) [37].  Cassidy et al.",c0c995ef-76a1-49b3-9720-ba39c6f0715b
12,methods12," were among the first authors to evaluate the intake of flavonoids in erectile dysfunction. The results of the Health Professions Follow-up study showed that a reduced incidence of ED was associated with increased habitual intake of specific foods rich in flavonoids. The greatest benefits from the increase in the consumption of flavonones, flavones, and anthocyanins were observed in overweight or obese young men. Of all the flavonoids recorded, flavones appeared to contribute the most to healthy erectile function [38], according to Mykoniatis’s study [37].",2a9c2e51-4afc-443a-835e-1e39cd99a190
13,methods13,"  Bauer also conducted a population-based prospective cohort study which included men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study with follow-up from January 1998 through January 2014, demonstrating that a higher-quality diet based on adherence to a Mediterranean diet or alternative to the Healthy Eating Index diet, which emphasize eating vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, and fish or other sources of long-chain (n-3) fats, as well as avoiding red and processed meats, was found to be associated with a lower risk of developing erectile dysfunction [39].  Taking together all these considerations, we postulate that dietary patterns have a significant role in ED severity (Figure 2) and should be investigated further in future studies.  4. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia  The histopathology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) characteristically consists of a dual hyperplasia of the epithelial and stromal compartment of the transitional zone of the prostate.",6f19af84-15b9-4f02-989e-6890fc504712
14,methods14," Epithelial hyperplastic features include nodules composed of variably sized and sometimes cystically dilated prostatic glands with a retained basal cell layer, often exhibiting corpora amylacea and/or calcifications; stromal hyperplasia consists of nodular proliferation of bland-looking spindle cells with rounded to ovoid nuclei, frequently resembling smooth muscle cells [40].  Several biological factors, including oxidative stress, inflammation, androgens, and enhanced expression of multiple growth factors, have been associated with benign and malignant prostatic disorders [41,42,43,44,45] (Figure 3).",4826f738-e665-4646-8c1f-45471bcf8132
15,methods15,"  In this regard, as some evidence has suggested that a high-fat diet is intrinsically correlated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by stimulating inflammation and oxidative stress [46], in recent decades, the potential association between different dietary patterns, including both macro- and micronutrients, and incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has become one of the most debated topics in scientific literature [47,48,49].  4.1. Studies in Animal Models  Numerous advances have been made in the comprehension of the molecular basis of the relationship between diet and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in animals.  Zhang et al. found that Vitamin D (VD) deficiency in early life promoted benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in middle-aged mice [50]; male pups, whose dams were fed with VD-deficient diets during pregnancy and lactation and continued to receive VD-deficient diets after weaning.",203b94df-4231-48c2-8f75-cbbf02e0e6be
16,methods16," Higher incidences of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were observed in this group of mice, compared to a control group of dams and male pups that received a standard diet. In addition, the authors [50] found that VD-deficient diets induced prostatic inflammation and fibrosis through the activation of the NF-κB-mediated pathway and the production of IL-6, as well as upregulation of the STAT3-mediated pathway that stimulates cell proliferation and growth. Interestingly, these prostatic effects were partially reversible if the standard diet was restored.  Li et al. showed that the combination of androgens and a high-fat diet-induced hyperinsulinemia promoted benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in rats and the activation of p-ERK1/2 could be implicated in this process [51].",dbd8ce5e-4974-42ac-ba02-ba68d0bf98e5
17,methods17," In particular, higher immunohistochemical and Western blot levels of p-ERK1/2 were observed both in rats with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) plus a high-fat diet and rats with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) compared to those found in rats with a high-fat diet and in a control group. However, it has also been reported that the administration of flaxseed reduced epithelial cell proliferative activity in rats with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [52,53]; this finding led to the supposition that different fat types and contents are involved in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) onset and maintenance. As further evidence for this hypothesis, Kayode et al. emphasized that a ketogenic diet, consisting of high fat, moderate protein and low carbohydrate consumption, ameliorated testosterone propionate-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in male Wistar rats [54].",06e99dff-8606-41ff-9d34-1ce681191041
18,methods18," Similarly, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG)), a green tea component, has been found to play an antioxidative and anti-benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) role in a metabolic syndrome rat model [55].  Recently, Aljehani et al. investigated the role of icariin (icariin (ICA)), a flavonol glycoside with marked phytoestrogenic activity in rats with metabolic syndrome (MS)-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [56]. Animals were divided into five groups (two out of five groups were fed a standard diet and MS was induced in the remaining three groups). MS rat groups were given vehicle, 25 mg/kg of icariin (ICA) and 50 mg/kg of icariin (ICA), respectively. The authors found that the administration of both icariin (ICA) doses had positive effects on prostate weight, prostate index, and histopathologic features of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).",21f68b60-2c50-4796-ac9a-5acc963d81ad
19,methods19," Furthermore, icariin (ICA) seemed to play antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory functions by regulating cyclin D1, Bax, Bcl2, and tumor necrosis factor-α expression.  Mangosteen pericarp powder (Mangosteen pericarp powder (MPP)), which originates from Mangosteen, a tropical fruit from the Malay islands and the Indonesian Moluccas, has been traditionally used for wounds and cutaneous infections. Recently, the consumption of MMP, whose xanthones are the main polyphenol compounds, has been found implicated in the decrease in prostate weight, serum testosterone, and attenuation of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in F344 male rats [57].  4.2. Studies in Human  benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a very frequent and age-related disease as it is estimated that about 50% of men over the age of 50, and 80% of those older than 70 suffer from it [58,59].",c5edc3e8-c5b3-44d3-bad0-b6af361808c4
20,methods20," Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) often exhibit acute urinary symptoms deriving from urethra compression and/or lower urinary tract symptoms (lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)s) [59]. Due to the huge impact of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) on populations, multiple studies have investigated its relationship with environmental factors, including the effects of several macro- and micronutrients [60,61].  A statistically significant correlation between higher risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and high consumption of fats and red meat or low consumption of proteins and vegetables has been found by the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT)) within a cohort of 18,800 patients aged more than 50 years.",44d5d685-d51e-4c49-aed7-e38e75198577
21,methods21," A slight relationship between lower risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and multiple nutrients, such as lycopene, VD and zinc was also established for this group; conversely, no association between this disease and antioxidant consumption was identified. Total but not dietary vitamin D was associated with reduced risk. Compared with men in the lowest quintile of total vitamin D intake, those in the highest quintile had an 18% reduced benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) risk (p-trend = 0.032). Compared with men eating red meat less than once per week, men eating red meat at least daily had a 38% increased benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) risk (p = 0.044) and, compared with men eating fewer than one serving of vegetables per day, men eating four or more servings had a 32% decreased benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) risk (p = 0.011) [62]. The protective role of lycopene supplementation on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has been also shown by Schwarz et al.",45422022-390b-42f3-b62f-bd9bf07a144a
22,methods22," who enrolled 40 patients with histologically proven benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The authors divided their patients into two groups: (i) lycopene at a dose of 15 mg/d for 6 months, (ii) placebo for 6 months, and found that patients who received lycopene had decreased PSA levels. No evidence of further prostate enlargement nor higher amelioration in symptoms of the disease were found, as assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)) questionnaire, compared to those who were given the placebo [63]. Further evidence of the anti-benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) effect of lycopene has been previously provided by Kim et al. from a clinical study on prostate cancer patients in which lycopene was found capable of inducing apoptosis in tumor-free prostatic tissue exhibiting the histologic features of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [64].  Rohrmann et al.",c6fa2965-7f0a-4a56-b50e-ebc1bbb47906
23,methods23," prospectively investigated the effects of fruits, vegetables and micronutrients on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and found an inverse correlation between intake of vegetables, especially those rich in beta-carotene, lutein, vitamin C (VC), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Interestingly, fruit intake resulted to be unrelated to the onset of the disease [65]. Conversely, the study by Lagiou et al., through the administration of a food frequency questionnaire, reported for a cohort of 420 patients, all permanent residents in Athens area, that fruit consumption with high levels of beta-carotene, lutein and VC were inversely correlated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) risk, while a high-fat diet, especially with increased intake of butter and margarine, had a positive correlation with the disease [66]. Based on these findings, the exact effects of a fruit-rich diet on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is still to be elucidated.",0940dfee-027d-4727-b91e-c76f61fbec27
24,methods24," It may be hypothesized that fruit consumption, according to the type and quantity, influences benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) onset and progression in a diversified manner. Similarly, little is known about the usefulness of polyphenols contained in green tea; in this regard, it has been suggested that they could be used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related symptoms, due to their positive effects on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [67].  Even with regard to the role of a high-fat diet, the evidence from the literature is not unique; although some of the above-mentioned studies stated an increased risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in patients with high fat consumption [62,66], Suzuki et al. found that benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) risk was modestly associated with intake of eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, and arachidonic acids, but not with energy-adjusted total fat intake [68].",bcbfc3ef-ab5a-4e87-b707-eebfe253bdd0
25,methods25,"  Similar to what has been reported on animal models [52,53], a strong utility of dietary flaxseed lignan extract in improving benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)s, compared to that of alpha1A-adrenoceptor blockers and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors, has been reported by Zhang et al. [69]. These authors conducted a randomized clinical trial in which a placebo, 300, or 600 mg/day of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, a flaxseed extract, were administered to 87 patients affected by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and found a decrease in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and improvement of quality of life score and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)s, respectively [69]. Conversely, it has been shown that pumpkin seed extract did not have any benefits on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) compared to the placebo over a 1-year period [70].",ba851ea1-93ca-4895-981c-35c79d1de2e4
26,methods26,"  The above-mentioned findings led us to emphasize that the exact relationship between different dietary patterns and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has not yet been fully elucidated; this is probably due to the fact that benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a multifactorial disease, whose pathogenesis seems to be correlated with different biological factors, including oxidative stress, androgenic stimulation and inflammatory and growth factors. Finally, recent advances have also highlighted the potential role of statins in reverting benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) symptoms by the improvement of hypercholesterolemia and metabolic syndrome [71].",f73f2c22-3f85-45dc-84b9-b4a24f7b1c6c
27,methods27," As far as we are aware, as most macro- and micronutrients that have been associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) risk also influence steroid concentrations, oxidative stress level and inflammation, it is reliable to suppose that they also have positive effects on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), regulating prostatic growth and smooth muscle tone (Figure 4).  5. Conclusions  In the present review, we have highlighted how the association between dietary patterns and two of the most frequent pathologies in urology, namely, erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia, is present in the literature. Evidence comes from both animal studies and in part from human studies. The data suggested that a diet that is more adherent to the Mediterranean diet or that emphasizes the presence of vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, and fish or other sources of long-chain (n-3) fats, in addition to reduced content of red meat, may have a beneficial role on erectile function.",1cbad59f-cfbf-4b9e-9cb6-197088c58c2b
28,methods28," At the same time, the same beneficial effects can be transferred to the benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) side due to the indirect regulatory effects on prostatic growth and smooth muscle tone, thus determining an improvement in symptoms. Certainly, in-depth studies and translational medicine are needed to confirm these encouraging data. Studies could address the relationship of dietary patterns and tissue expression as a marker of disease severity, such as NO and cAMP for ED and markers of inflammation for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Finally, clinical studies investigating the role of specific drugs for metabolic syndromes, such as statins or hypoglycemic drugs, together with investigations of dietary patterns could be beneficial in better understanding how to counteract ED and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
