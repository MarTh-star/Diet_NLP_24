0,discussion0," It is unclear whether most established physiological dysfunctions are causative factors of AD, results of AD, or both. According to the existing body of literature, AD pathogenesis is triggered by the interdependent reverberations of Aβ plaque formation, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, NFT accumulation, glial inflammation, and the ultimate loss of neural plasticity and proper neuron function. The search for nonpharmaceutical tools to relieve AD symptoms sparked interest in gut-modulatory therapies, which are expected to have a considerable influence on brain homeostasis through the GBA.  The GBA allows microbes, metabolites, and neuroactive compounds to communicate via a complex network of neural, hormonal, and immunological pathways. As a result, dietary interventions help reverse increased oxidation levels, impaired neuroactive pathways, and damage to the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, conferring health benefits that could prove helpful in managing AD.",e73a24ca-4aa3-4987-bcb5-d0eface0f9d1
1,discussion1," Fixing diet-induced dysbiosis is an especially intriguing first step toward addressing the AD epidemic, as current FDA-approved medications have proven to be ineffective and emphasize the need for alternative approaches. Indeed, several researchers speak of the promising potential of gut microbiota-modifying therapies, such as probiotics, fermented foods, and plant-based dietary patterns. Inevitably, eliminating Western foods and unhealthy habits may also reverse the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.  Yet, while research attention has focused on the potential ameliorating role of diet in neurodegeneration, there has been little evidence underscoring both disease-modifying/total reversal capabilities as well as the practicality of an all-encompassing diet therapy for the clinical management of AD, especially in late-onset stages.",03c24dc2-8a8b-4f5c-91ef-1f47a4b10fb1
2,discussion2," Thus, significant lifestyle changes should be considered as purely a preventative measure for AD in the healthy population, and this quality could be made a priority during stages of mild cognitive impairment to help alleviate stresses on the GBA. This is especially vital considering the feasibility of simple dietary switches before and during the early stages of AD. Research on cases of severe cognitive decline should review the plausibility of dietary adherence in the context of medication side effects, a decline in appetite, the need to shift focus to the prevention of malnutrition (which entails a high-calorie diet rather than specific dietary adherence), and the consideration that aggressive nutritional support may not be appropriate once significant neurodegeneration has occurred. These concerns raise the need to identify the exact period in late-stage AD when it becomes medically futile to take dietary precautionary measures.",a6fc2dec-7fdd-4c52-b4c3-9bf77923ab19
3,discussion3,"  Future studies should continue to compare the longitudinal effectiveness of different dietary patterns as a strategy to reverse AD during progressive stages, identify the relative sequence and timing of such dietary interventions within a very complex cascade of physiological events with the assistance of preclinical biomarkers, and help establish future dietary guidelines that promote neuroprotective foods and augment brain function.
