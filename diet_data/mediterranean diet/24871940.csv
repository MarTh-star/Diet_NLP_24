0,introduction0,"The Mediterranean Diet (MD) is a dietary pattern established in countries of the Mediterranean Basin in the mid-1950s in a situation of severe economic difficulties and resource limitations due to the effects of World War II. These conditions, alongside a low level of technology, favored a physically active and a frugal lifestyle, with a predominance of vegetable products and scarcity of animal-derived products in the diet [1]. Many of these life habits have been preserved and are part of our dietary traditions, being protected by the UNESCO as an Intangible World Cultural Heritage [2].  Current studies show that Mediterranean populations generally meet around 50% of MD recommendations [3–8]. Numerous indexes or scores have been applied to measure adherence to this dietary pattern. The first and most widely used is the Mediterranean Dietary Score (Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)), proposed by Trichopoulou et al.",6de8d5ec-f5c9-4f55-b8e7-49952217f909
1,introduction1," [9,10], which assesses the compliance with this dietary pattern in adults, including the elderly, assigning 1 point when the intake of protective foods in the MD is above the median or when the intake of non-protective foods is below the median, and 0 points in the opposite situations. Other indexes based on the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS) have been proposed that are adapted to specific situations and/or use a different calculation approach. Examples include: KIDMED [11], which assesses adherence to the MD among children and adolescents; the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)-p designed for pregnant women, which considers micronutrients especially relevant during pregnancy, such as iron, calcium, and folic acid [5]; the Breakfast Quality Index (Breakfast Quality Index (BQI)), which assesses the quality of this meal in the context of the MD [12]; the MDP, which calculates the percentage adherence to the MD pattern using the Z value [13]; and, most recently,",c834ca1d-64f3-4945-b02b-e162b984be9d
2,introduction2," the relative Mediterranean Diet Score (rMediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)), based on the nutrient density model with intake divided into tertiles [14].  Application of these indexes has revealed changes in dietary habits, based on differences among the three or four generations coexisting in given populations. Thus, a greater adherence to this dietary pattern has been shown by elderly people than by younger age groups [14,15]. The former preserve conventional cooking and eating habits, preparing recipes based on legumes, vegetables, potatoes, olive oil, and cereals, etc., eating bread with meals and fruit as dessert. Moreover, meals are not only regarded as necessary for nutritional intake but also as an important family and social event [16].",18ffecb1-9c75-4980-851b-974ca0f190a9
3,introduction3," In contrast, the eating habits of younger populations (children and adolescents) are closer to Western dietary patterns, with a higher consumption of fats and proteins than recommended, to the detriment of carbohydrate intake, and a deficient intake of vitamins and minerals [15]. Along with a less physically active lifestyle than in the past, these changes have been related to the early onset of non-transmittable chronic diseases such as obesity, type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and some types of cancer [17,18].  The new MD pyramid has been adapted to specific national settings (e.g., in relation to portion sizes) and to variations in the dietary pattern among different Mediterranean regions and cultures.",c1da9625-ac9b-4bfb-bed5-d1c6720287b9
4,introduction4," In view of this recent update, the aim of this study was to propose and validate a new instrument to measure MD adherence based on the consumption of food servings and food groups, and apply it in a female population from southern Spain and determining influential factors.  Material and Methods Study Population Females aged between 12 and 83 years (n = 1155) were recruited between 2005 and 2009 from participants in a research project in Southern Spain in which a very small minority of volunteers were males, explaining the decision to enroll only females. They had all participated in different research studies under the auspices of the Health Department of Granada City Council and University of Granada. The study population was divided into three generational groups: Group 1, adolescents aged between 12 and 19 yrs (n = 610); Group 2: adults between 20 and 60 yrs (n = 313); and Group 3: over 60-year-olds (n = 232).",c3606294-3edf-47a8-bbc5-48917e3a0b26

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants as well as from the parents or guardians of minors.  Questionnaire After obtaining informed consent to participate in the study, trained researchers used a self-administered questionnaire to gather data from each participant on the following variables: age, weight and height using a model 872 Seca digital floor scale and a model 214 Seca portable stadiometer (Seca Medical Scales and Measuring Systems, Birmingham, UK), socioeconomic variables (educational level, profession), and dietary habit variables, including: number of meals/day, place of meal, special diet (e.g., weight-reducing or therapeutic diet) during the previous year, habit of snacking between meals, consumption of “diet” products) (Table 1).",a5e9d07f-0a91-4c80-8011-61febd895cb2
6,introduction6," All participants completed a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) previously validated by our research group [8,19,20].

The amounts of food consumed were expressed in g, mL, domestic measures (e.g., slice, tablespoon, cup), or standard portions [21]. The questionnaire included 129 items classified into 11 food groups (cereals, vegetables, fruit, eggs, meat, fish, fats, prepared foods, sauces, alcohol-free drinks, and alcoholic drinks) and required a mean time of 30 min to complete.",9a741559-dc2f-4e5c-9d2b-fc0c2bebe66f

9,introduction9,"  Mediterranean Dietary Serving Score (Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S) The proposed Mediterranean Dietary Serving Score (Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S) is based on the latest update of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid [16], using the recommended consumption frequency of different foods and food groups. Individuals whose intake is within the number of recommended servings are awarded a score of 3, 2, or 1 points for recommendations expressed in times/meal, times/day, or times/week, respectively. This approach gives greater importance to foods that should be consumed in every meal (fruit, vegetables, olive oil, cereals), followed by those that should be consumed daily (dairy products and dried fruit and nuts), and finally, those that should be consumed weekly (potatoes, legumes, eggs, fish, white meat, red meat, sweets). In adults, 1 point is added for alcohol intake equivalent to 1 and 2 glasses of wine or beer (fermented drinks) for females and males, respectively.",238b0389-d7ea-48fe-bb20-f1aba3be618c
10,introduction10," A score of 0 is given when the number of servings/meal, week, or day is higher or lower than the recommendation. Hence, the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S ranges between 0 and 24 points for adults/elderly, and between 0 and 23 for adolescents, because no level of fermented beverages consumption is considered positive in this age group (Table 1).

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)) curve was constructed to analyze the discriminative power or correct subject classification capacity according to the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S. The reference method was the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS) [9,10], which ranges from 0 to 9; the cutoff point of 6 selected to differentiate MD adherents and non-adherents was that proposed by most authors for this purpose [23–26]. The sensitivity of the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S was calculated as the ratio of true positives to true positives plus false negatives; the specificity was calculated as the ratio of true negatives to true negatives plus false positives [27].",86b24f3a-7401-4b70-a691-ac98f598914c

Finally, logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors predicting the highest adherence to Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S, adjusting for age. The highest adherence was defined as an Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S above the cut-off point of the third tertile (Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S≥16). P<0.05 was considered significant.

23,discussion1,"273; elderly: p = 0.743) (data not shown).  The Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S is an updated instrument that includes the most important novelties of the new MD pyramid [16]: 1) it classifies consumption frequency in servings per meal, day, or week, which is reflected in different scores; 2) the olive oil intake recommendation is changed to one serving per main meal (at the base of the pyramid with fruit, vegetables, and cereals); and 3) the recommended potato consumption frequency is reduced to ≤3 times/week (separated from the cereal group). Additionally, the proposed index considers the upper and lower recommended limits for each food group (when available), and therefore penalizes individuals both when they do not reach the recommended intake and when they exceed it. In the case of dairy products, the percentage of the study population classified as within recommendations was 52.5% with the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS) (below median dairy product consumption) but only 36.",4f666df7-f14d-469a-823c-902ccba9af05
24,discussion2,"0% with the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S, which classified 11.5% of the population as below recommendations (2 servings/day). It should be taken into account that the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS) and other indexes of MD adherence developed before publication of the current guidelines offer less exhaustive criteria and were based on median values and the distribution in tertiles [5,6,9,12,14,32]. In the case of vegetable intake, 52.4% of the present study population was above the median vegetable intake (150 g), but this cut-off point differs from current recommendations (≥ 2 servings/meal ≈ 250–300 g/meal). Therefore, the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S only classified 11.4% of subjects as within recommendations (Table 3). Except in these two cases, the population was classified in a similar manner by the proposed index and the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS), explaining the AUC value of >0.8 and supporting the validity of the new instrument.",aa4224a3-cd60-4000-9d6f-dd24f4476758
25,discussion3,"  Another novelty of the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S is that the total score is more influenced by meeting (or not) the recommendations of the foods at the base of the pyramid than those at its apex. Out of a maximum score of 24 points, 12 (50%) are scored when the recommended intake of fruit, vegetables, cereals, and olive oil (at the base of the pyramid) is met, 4 points (17%) for the recommended intake of dairy products and dried fruits and nuts, and 8 points (33%) for the recommended intake of legumes, potatoes, eggs, fish, white meat, red meat, sweets, and fermented drinks. Other diet quality indexes have reported a similar influence on the fulfillment of recommendations for all of these items [28,30].  The design of the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S permits assessment of MD adherence without the need to estimate nutrient intake.",b182c972-443d-41d4-a9e2-e728776b439f
26,discussion4," Given the importance of MUFA in cardiovascular health, the MUFA/SFA ratio is frequently considered in MD adherence patterns, with the recommendation of a high ratio because the main fat of the diet is olive oil [16]. The intake of 1 olive oil serving per meal ensures a supply of approximately 30 g MUFA/day, while the consumption of foods that are sources of SFA (dairy products, meats, and animal fat) is more limited in the MD, with a greater control over the intake of this less healthy fat. The MD recommends moderate alcohol consumption during meals (25–50 g/day for males and 5–25 g/day for females) [10], which translates into 2 servings of fermented drinks (wine or beer) a day for males and 1 for females. This study considered the consumption of fermented drinks (wine and beer) in order to reflect the importance of ethanol and non-nutritive substances (polyphenols, phytosterols, etc.), which endow the diet with antioxidant and cardioprotective properties.",124e963e-9e19-41ff-adb3-2c7e73abf59d
27,discussion5,"  Most indexes of MD adherence consider 9 items in comparison to the 14 included in the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S, which differentiates between the consumption of fresh fruit and dried fruit/nuts, cereals, and potatoes and red and white meats and introduces two new items to assess the intake of eggs and sweets. This permits a more accurate diagnosis of adherence to the MD by including more variables related to the characteristics of this dietary pattern [33].  In the present study, age was the main influential factor in MD adherence, as reported by other researchers [34–36]. The younger participants tended to follow a less healthy dietary pattern such as the Western diet, as reported in other studies [37–39]. A greater MD adherence was shown by individuals with lower BMI and those who did not snack between meals; this snacking, outside the five meals that should be eaten daily, is usually characterized by the intake of high-calorie foods, favoring weight gain [37].",3283f4b8-3100-412a-83a3-582b98f40f6c
28,discussion6," The inverse relationship between the BMI and MD adherence may explain the protective role of this diet against chronic non-transmittable disease evidenced in numerous studies [40–42].  One study limitation was that the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to explore the diagnostic capacity of Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S, considering the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS) as reference method, given the absence of a gold-standard pattern that is effective to assess MD adherence with high sensitivity and specificity values. Despite differences between the indexes, the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S proved able to differentiate between those following and not following the MD (using the median value as cut-off), as in the case of the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS). In addition, the study population only included females, and the factors that determine greater adherence to the MD are likely to differ between males and females.",93bf69cf-4828-48f9-8179-b57260c1bf07
29,discussion7," Finally, the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S considers foods and food groups, whereas other diet quality indexes also include nutrients (trans-FA, SFA/MUFA ratio, ethanol). Control of the intake of these nutrients is considered in the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S through the limits established for certain foods, as mentioned above. This limitation could even be considered an advantage, by allowing non-specialists to apply the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S for MD adherence estimation in a simple and rapid manner.  The possible protective role of the MD against non-transmittable chronic diseases was not considered in the development of this index. The Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S is proposed as an alternative to other diet quality indexes, considering the number of portions of each food group that should form part of a healthy diet in accordance with the new MD pyramid.",48fc5ceb-2fec-406e-bfbd-99918f9edc5f
30,discussion8," One future approach of interest may be to explore the relationship between food groups composing the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S and mortality [32].  Conclusions The Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S is an updated, easy, valid, and accurate instrument that assesses adherence to the MD, considering the consumption of foods and food groups per meal, day, or week. The lack of adherence of younger age groups to healthy dietary patterns, such as the MD, underlines the need to develop and apply nutritional education programs as prevention measures against the early onset of chronic non-transmittable diseases. These could have an important impact not only on the short-and long-term health of individuals but also on healthcare costs.
