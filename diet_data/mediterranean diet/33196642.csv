0,methods0," 2.1. Study Population  Participants were from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (Australia Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH)), a national population-based study of more than 58,000 women across four birth cohorts: original cohorts included women born in 1973–1978, 1946–1951, 1921–1926 [41]; a new cohort of women born in 1989–1995 was subsequently added [42]. The three original cohorts of women were randomly sampled from the Medicare database, covering all citizens and permanent residents [41], with the more recent 1989–1995 cohort recruited using a combination of in-person, internet, and social media contact [42].  Ethical approval for Australia Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) was granted by the Human Ethics committees of the University of Newcastle (approval number: h–076–0795) and University of Queensland (approval number: 200400224), and the study conforms to the ethical requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki.",94795162-f682-4d55-a313-4d1fe1109d29
1,methods1," Further details about Australia Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) are available on the study website (http://www.alswh.org.au) [43].  The current study used data from the 1946–51 cohort who completed baseline surveys in 1996 (survey 1, S1), a second survey in 1998 (survey 2, S2), and then every three years until 2016 (survey 8, S8). A total of 13,714 women aged 45–50 provided baseline data (S1, 1996), of which 8622 (63% of the S1 sample) completed S8 (2016). The participants were asked to provide information on their physical and mental health, health service uses as well as sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, including dietary intake information assessed by the Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) known as the Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies version 2 (DQES-v2) [44]. The DQES-v2 was included in S3 (in 2001) and Diet Quality Index (DQI) predictors were held constant across the study period.",7c554bcd-1f13-4d4e-99f5-5c3ce51f534f
2,methods2,"  In this study, data from S3 (2001, age: 50–55 years, n = 5350) were used as the baseline survey; however, sample selection was informed by S1 and S2, and covariates were included that were only measured at S1 (e.g., education). Women who responded to S3 in 2001 and at least one Australia Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) survey between S4 (2004) and S8 (2016, aged 65–70 years) were included in the current study. Women were excluded if they had reported diagnosis of non communicable disease (NCD)s such as DM, coronary heart disease (CHD), HT, asthma, and cancer (except skin cancer) at or before baseline (S3). Women with missing Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) data at S3 were also excluded. Figure 1 presents a simplified description of the study data for analysis. In total, 5350 women from S3 onwards were included for the final analysis (Figure 2). Further details on respondent numbers and loss to follow up from S4 to S8 are shown in Supplementary Table S1.  2.2.",3a78eb65-cd42-4b38-b1ac-d242e7a8641d
3,methods3," Dietary Assessment  The DQES-v2 is a semi-quantitative, validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) [44] that was included in the Australia Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) survey at S3 (2001). Nutrient intakes were estimated using data from the Australian NUTTAB95 nutrient composition tables [45]. Respondents were asked their usual intake over the last 12 months for 74 food items and six alcoholic beverages on a 1-to-10-point scale, ranging from “Never” to “≥3 times per day” for food items and “Never” to “Every day” for beverages. The validity of DQES-v2 was tested against a seven-day weighed food record and the resulting energy-adjusted correlation coefficients ranged between 0.28 and 0.70, demonstrating its adequacy for assessing habitual intake [46]. Items on the complete Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) were converted to servings or grams per day for analyses.  2.3.",da48bd69-9962-47c5-a3c2-263613264d4b
4,methods4," Exposure Variables  The exposure variables were Diet Quality Index (DQI)s derived from the one DQES-v2 at S3, held constant across S4–S8. Baldwin et al. have shown diet quality to be relatively stable over the 12 years from S3 in 2001 to S7 in 2013 in the same Australia Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) 1946–51 cohort, when the DQES-v2 was next repeated [47]. Therefore, in our analyses, diet at S3 was used to predict non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes in repeated cross-sectional analyses for S4 to S8.  Three Diet Quality Index (DQI)s were selected from our previous systematic review and critical appraisal [48].",fe93d42c-8994-4363-9387-4fafc7287916
5,methods5," The three indices reflect different theoretical approaches: (1) Healthy Eating Index for Australian Adults-2013 (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013) measures adherence to Australian Dietary Guidelines-2013 (ADG-2013) [49]; (2) Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) measures adherence to a specific dietary pattern; and (3) Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010) measures consumption of foods and nutrients beneficial for chronic disease prevention. The computation and scoring system for each diet quality index (Diet Quality Index (DQI)) is provided in Supplementary Table S2.  The Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013, the index based on ADG-2013 [49] was developed and validated in Australian young adults [50]. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013 ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater adherence to the dietary guidelines. Full details of the validation and the scoring system are published elsewhere [50,51].",9cafc869-b45e-4fb9-9a33-6301c25ef1f7
6,methods6," The Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013 is composed of 11 components: 5 components of core food groups including grains (cereals), vegetables, fruits, milk and alternatives, and meat and protein alternatives; discretionary foods; 4 components of nutrients such as fats, added sugars, sodium, and alcohol; and water. For each component, the minimum score is zero and the maximum score is 10 points, except alcohol and water which contribute 5 points each. The scores for milk and alternatives, meat and protein alternatives, and discretionary foods were based on the number of servings consumed only. The scores for grains (cereals) were sub-divided into the number of servings of total grains (5 points) and the number of servings of whole grains (5 points). Moreover, the scores for vegetables and fruits were also subdivided into the number of servings consumed (5 points) and the variety (5 points).",238c4f5e-c65d-4515-a276-fa171ab84a9e
7,methods7," The scores were given incrementally based on ADG-2013 [49]: the maximum score was given for meeting the guidelines and the minimum score for not meeting the guidelines. For example, if a woman consumed <2.5 servings of discretionary food, she would receive 10 points; for 2.5–3.4 servings, she received 7.5 points; for 3.5–4.4 servings, she received 5 points; for 4.5–5.4, she received 2.5 points; and no points if she consumed ≥5.5 servings. Therefore, the minimum and maximum number of servings required for this study were: total grains (cereals) (1 to 6 servings), vegetables (1 to 5 servings), wholegrains (1 to 3 servings), fruit (0.5 to 2 servings), meat and protein alternatives (0.5 to 2.5 servings), milk and alternatives (0.5 to 2.5 servings), and discretionary foods (5.5 to 2.5 servings). The vegetable variety score was calculated if the respondents reported consumption of at least one serving (75 g) of green, orange, cruciferous, tuber, or bulb and 0.",8a3c0f38-90a0-4ecd-b3af-99bc99cc6e76
8,methods8,"5 servings of legumes, with 1 point given for each variety. For fruit variety, 5 points were given for if 2 or more varieties of fruit were consumed. No points were given for scores below the minimum ranges.  For scoring of nutrients components, the fats component was scored for saturated fats (5 points) and mono-unsaturated fatty acid (mono unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)) and poly-unsaturated fatty acid (poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)) (5 points). Energy from saturated fat ≤ 10% scored 5 points, >10–12% scored 2.5 points, and >12% scored 0 points. Two servings of mono unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) scored 5 points; 0 servings scored 0 points. Sodium intake < 1610 mg scored 10 points; 1610 mg to 2300 mg scored 5 points; and >2300 mg scored 0 points. Although the updated food composition tables for Australia included “added sugar” [52], previously, there was no available data for “added sugar”.",abc4aa7f-1f6a-400a-97d3-9ec20e112c1f
9,methods9," Therefore, percentage of energy from total sugar was used in this calculation and gave scores of 10 points to <5% total sugar; 5 points to 5–10% total sugar and 0 points to >10% of total sugar. Alcohol intake was scored as the number of standard drinks (10 g of alcohol) consumed and ≤2 standard drinks scored 5 points and >2 standard drinks scored 0 points.  Although water and other beverage intake was not assessed by the DQES-v2, the frequency of intake of cola, diet cola, other carbonated drinks, cordials, milk or soy milk, fruit or vegetable juices, tea, herbal tea, coffee, and water was included in S3. Water intake (including water/tea/herbal tea/coffee) was calculated as the proportion of water consumed in relation to other beverages with >50% scoring 5 points and 0% scoring 0 points, with each 10% increase between 0% and 50% scoring an additional 1 point.",8870a83e-af9e-41b2-a327-b34a8b5b70f7
10,methods10,"  The Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)), based on assessment of adherence to a Mediterranean diet, was developed and modified by Trichopoulou et al. [53]. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) can range from zero (minimum adherence) to nine (maximum adherence). This index was composed of nine components: vegetables, legumes, fruits, cereals, fish, lipid ratio, red meat and meat products, dairy products, and alcohol [53]. For calculation of the lipid ratio, both the sum of mono unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) were included in the numerator and saturated fat was included as a denominator. In this study, participants whose consumed amounts of vegetables, legumes, fruits, cereals, fish, and lipid ratio were below the sample median were assigned zero; those equal to or above scored one.",c94bbf34-1112-40b2-b2a8-a809c4221099
11,methods11," Conversely, women who consumed red meat and meat products, and dairy products below the sample median were assigned one; those equal or above scored zero. Those who consumed alcohol in the range of 5 g to 25 g/day were assigned a value of one; above or below that range scored zero.  AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 was based on foods and nutrients that lowered chronic diseases and modelled on Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)) [27]. The AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 scoring ranges from 0 to 110, with a higher value representing healthier eating habits. Full details of the scoring system are published elsewhere [27].",10999277-e984-45e7-9cf6-deb070548a3b
12,methods12," It is composed of 11 components: vegetables, fruit, whole grains, nuts and legumes, long chain omega-3 fats, and poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) considered as positive; intakes of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and fruit juice, red and processed meat, trans- fat, and sodium considered as negative; and alcohol intake considered as part of healthy diet if consumed in moderation. Each component was given a score between zero (less healthy diet) and 10 (healthier diet), with intermediate values scored proportionally to their intake. The minimum and maximum scoring for positive components were: vegetables (0–5 servings/day), fruit (0–4 servings/day), whole grain (75 g/day), nuts and legumes (0–1 serving/day), long chain omega-3 fats (0–250 mg/day) and poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (2–10% of energy). Conversely, participants who consumed SSBs and fruit juice (≥1 serving/day), or red and processed meat (≥1.",7822720c-7749-4026-9966-54861d25dd97
13,methods13,"5 servings/day), or trans-fat (≥4% of energy) or sodium (highest decile (mg/day)) were given minimum score. Those consuming no SSBs and fruit juice, or no red and processed meat, or ≤0.5% of energy from trans-fat or lowest decile (mg/day) of sodium were given maximum score. For alcohol intake, women consumed ≥2.5 drinks/day were assigned the minimum score and 0.5–1.5 drinks/day were assigned the maximum score.  2.4. Outcome Variables  The main outcome variables were:The incidence of non communicable disease (NCD)s (DM, coronary heart disease (CHD), HT, asthma, cancer (excluding skin cancer), depression and/or anxiety; incident cases following S3, with cases accumulating over time);  Multimorbidity (defined as the co-existence of two or more of the above non communicable disease (NCD)s);  All-cause mortality (new deaths since the last survey).",a495206b-5855-48aa-877b-ab9921f199f7
14,methods14,"  The occurrence of common non communicable disease (NCD)s was self-reported by participants and has been shown to be reliably reported against administrative data [54]. At S1, women were asked whether they had been diagnosed with either diabetes (high blood sugar), heart disease, or hypertension (high blood pressure), or asthma or cancer (breast, cervical, lung, bowel, and skin cancer) by using the question “Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have? (Circle one number on each line)?” At S2, their disease status of non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes, heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure), asthma, cancer (breast, cervical, bowel, skin, and other cancer), depression, and anxiety were assessed by asking “Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have…? (Mark as many as applicable. Leave blank if you have never had this problem).” The responses included “yes, in the last 2 years” and “yes, more than two years ago”.",a2992210-80e5-46ab-95f5-66dfcbb7cbb9
15,methods15," From S3 to S8, they were asked whether they had been diagnosed with common non communicable disease (NCD)s since the last survey (i.e., in the last 3 years) by using the question “In the past three years, have you been diagnosed or treated for: (Mark all that apply)”.  non communicable disease (NCD)s were treated as reported by the women and also as enduring conditions [55], meaning that once a diagnosis was reported it was retained regardless of subsequent survey reports, except for depression and/or anxiety (Supplementary Table S3). Incidence of multimorbidity was defined as the co-existence of two or more of the selected non communicable disease (NCD)s (i.e., any combination of DM, coronary heart disease (CHD), HT, asthma, cancer (excluding skin cancer), and depression and/or anxiety) from S4 in 2004 to S8 in 2016.",272757d4-49ad-4153-877d-40369d73edcd
16,methods16," For the main analysis, women who had not reported DM, coronary heart disease (CHD), HT, asthma, and cancer (excluding skin cancer) at or before S3 in 2001 were included, to ensure the measure of diet quality preceded the health outcomes of interest, creating a temporal sequence.  All-cause mortality was assessed from the Australia Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) participant status and cause of death data that had been linked with the Australian National Death Index. Any cause recorded on the death certificate was counted. Incident deaths were new deaths recorded between surveys; however, total deaths across S4–S8 were also modelled.  2.5.",4b56dfbe-8e8c-44e4-890c-2b0dadd26ea5
17,methods17," Covariates  Directed Acyclic Graphs (Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)s) [56,57] were constructed to illustrate the assumptions regarding causal relationship between exposure (diet), outcome (non communicable disease (NCD)s), and covariates across surveys (S4 to S8, 15 years of follow-up), and to identify confounders and mediators for statistical modelling. Based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)s, the unbiased estimate of the relationship between Diet Quality Index (DQI)s and non communicable disease (NCD) multimorbidity, and all-cause mortality could be obtained. The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)s show the main exposure (diet quality, measured once at S3) and the main outcomes (non communicable disease (NCD), multimorbidity and all-cause mortality at S4–S8).",55714077-094d-47b9-a631-12990ddefaeb
18,methods18," Socioeconomic status (residence status, marital status, education, occupation, ability to manage income) and lifestyle variables (smoking, physical activity, taking prescribed and over-the-counter medicine) affect both exposure and outcome and hence are considered as confounders. Diet quality can influence body mass index, which can influence the risk of non communicable disease (NCD) multimorbidity and all-cause mortality; therefore, it is considered as the mediator and not adjusted for in models. The schematic illustration showing the association between exposure and outcomes, and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)s are included in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2.",4884fa1a-4279-4dfc-b261-3f4698f029da
19,methods19,"  The following time-varying covariates during the 15-year follow-up (S4 to S8) were included: age, area of residence (urban, inner regional, outer regional/rural), marital status (not married, married/de facto, separated/divorced/widow), education (no formal education, certificate (intermediate/high school), certificate (apprenticeship/diploma), university/higher degree), occupation (no paid job, paid job), ability to manage income (easy/not bad, difficult), smoking status (never smoked, history of smoking, currently smoke), physical activity (nil/sedentary (0–39 MET min/week), low (40–599 MET min/week), moderate (600–1199 MET min/week), high (≥1200 MET min/week)) [58], and taking prescribed medicine (no, yes), taking over-the-counter (over the counter (OTC)) medicine (no, yes).",d438b01d-e2ce-4b7d-ae30-b0a2c6574d8d
20,methods20," Since education status was assessed at S1 and S6, rather than every survey, participants’ education status at S3, S4 and S5 were created by using the value at S1 and S6; at S7 and S8 were created by using the value at S6. Missing items for covariates (range: 0.1–9.9%) (area of residence, marital status, education, occupation, ability to manage income, smoking status, physical activity, taking prescribed medicine, taking over the counter (OTC) medicine) were replaced applying the carry forward approach from the subsequent survey (for S4 to S7) and the response from the preceding survey (for S8).  Use of prescribed and over the counter (OTC) medicines was assessed inconsistently across the Australia Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) surveys. Use of prescribed medicine during the past 4 weeks was assessed as number of different types of medicine (S1, S2), binary response (S5 to S8), and multiple responses (S3, S4).",d4ad9bc4-4d7a-41e1-949a-aa50469e7160
21,methods21," Likewise, women’s over the counter (OTC) medicine use status during the past 4 weeks was assessed as number of different types of medicine (S1 to S4), binary response (S5 to S8), and multiple responses (S3, S4). To harmonise these approaches, we generated binary variables for use of both prescribed and over the counter (OTC) medicine. Detailed information about Australia Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) survey variables can be found at http://www.alswh.org.au/for-researchers/data [59].  2.6. Statistical Analysis  Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 15. We performed repeated cross-sectional analyses using the Diet Quality Index (DQI) measures from S3 (held constant across subsequent surveys) to predict outcomes at S4 to S8, with adjustment for covariates from S4 to S8. Descriptive statistics of the baseline sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics of women (at S3) were expressed as mean± standard deviation (sd) or n (%).",87ea3910-b952-46d8-825c-a2986960b07b
22,methods22," Association between sociodemographic, lifestyle variables (at S3), and Diet Quality Index (DQI)s (at S3) were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-squared test for categorical variables. All-cause mortality and multimorbidity of non communicable disease (NCD)s of interest (DM, coronary heart disease (CHD), HT, asthma, cancer (excluding skin cancer), depression and/or anxiety) was determined. Diet Quality Index (DQI)s were calculated and described as a continuous measure (mean ± sd) and categorical measure (quintiles). Baseline characteristics of participants (at S1) that were included and excluded from the current study were also compared to explore potential selection bias (Supplementary Table S4).",93b9a109-81c8-46e3-9e51-84cd005455f1
23,methods23,"  Assuming the participants’ DQ were consistent across the 15 years of follow-up (five surveys, S4 at 2004 to S8 at 2016), association between Diet Quality Index (DQI)s at S3 and non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes were tested using bivariate (unadjusted) models. Multivariate models (adjusted for covariates at five surveys; sociodemographic variables such as age, residence, marital status, education, occupation, ability to manage income, and lifestyle variables including smoking, physical activity, and taking prescribed and over the counter (OTC) medicine) were fitted for effect estimates of Diet Quality Index (DQI)s on non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes (each disease and multimorbidity). The odds ratios and 95% CI for non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes (each disease and multimorbidity) with respect to Diet Quality Index (DQI)s were calculated considering the lowest quintile as the reference category.",4099ec62-4c2d-40a8-9f50-977f72b7ade2
24,methods24," For the all-cause mortality outcome where numbers were low, quintile 4 and 5 of the Diet Quality Index (DQI)s were collapsed into one category, indicating high diet quality. The association between Diet Quality Index (DQI)s and all-cause mortality was reported as the ratio of the highest category (quintile 4 + 5) to the lowest category (quintile 1). Multivariate logistic regression models [60] were used to investigate the association between diet quality and non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes (each disease and multimorbidity) and all-cause mortality.  To check the robustness of the findings, sensitivity analyses using a subset of cases were undertaken, including n = 4026 women who remained at S8, 2016 for non communicable disease (NCD)s (each disease and multimorbidity), and n = 3032 women who ever had any non communicable disease (NCD) from S3, 2001 to S8, 2016 for all-cause mortality (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6).",f93b3acc-6f8f-424d-9bd3-887ffb2b1a18
25,methods25," The association between Diet Quality Index (DQI)s and total deaths accumulated across S4–S8 were investigated (Supplementary Table S7). A p value < 0.05 is considered significant, with consideration given to multiple comparisons, and all statistical tests are two-sided.  3. Results  The current study included 5350 women who were free of non communicable disease (NCD)s at S3 in 2001. The mean (±sd) of Diet Quality Index (DQI)s for the sample at S3 were 57.15 ± 8.16 (range: 25.42–86.67) for Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013; 4.35 ± 1.75 (range: 0–9) for Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), and 56.01 ± 10.32 (range: 26–93.75) for AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, respectively. Across three Diet Quality Index (DQI)s, women with higher scores had university/higher degree, the ability to manage income easily, never smoked, and were more physically active than women with lower scores.",4ad39d93-f504-4e4b-8e58-21d78a66b317
26,methods26," Compared with their counterparts with Diet Quality Index (DQI) quintile 1, those in quintile 5 of Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013 and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 were older and more likely to be in paid work; those in quintile 5 of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 had a healthy weight range and were more likely to have taken over-the-counter medicine. Those in the highest AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 quintile were more often from an urban area (Table 1).  Table 2 shows results from univariate and multivariate logistic regression models estimating the association between Diet Quality Index (DQI)s and risk of common non communicable disease (NCD)s (including multimorbidity). Compared with the lowest quintile of Diet Quality Index (DQI)s, women reporting the highest quintile had reduced odds of non communicable disease (NCD)s (each disease and multimorbidity), especially in the later surveys.",98281f22-e11f-42d8-a223-b9b22deffe4e
27,methods27," From S5 to S8 (2007 to 2016), those with AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) quintile 5 had 42–56% reduced odds of DM comparing those with quintile 1. Likewise, we found a long-term protective effect of Diet Quality Index (DQI)s on HT (i.e., decreased odds of HT among those with higher scores of three Diet Quality Index (DQI)s; Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013 (S7: 26%, S8: 35%), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (S6: 27%, S7: 25%, and S8: 24%, respectively) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 (S8: 26%)) (Table 2).  The reduced odds of having asthma at S7 and S8 were found among those in the highest quintile of AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 compared with those in the lowest quintile. Those in the highest quintile of Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013 and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) had reduced odds of depression and/or anxiety, Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013 (at S6 30%, 95% CI: 0.51–0.98); Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (at S7 30%, 0.49–0.96; and at S8 34%, 0.46–0.94), respectively.",e15e91bd-4ef0-4bdf-bef1-ddf08abcb873
28,methods28," Lower odds of having non communicable disease (NCD) multimorbidity at S7 and S8 were found among those with higher scores of Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013 and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 (Table 2).  Although we did not find any association between Diet Quality Index (DQI)s and coronary heart disease (CHD) in multivariate models, there were univariate inverse associations (at S5: Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS); at S6: Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013, Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010; at S7 and S8: AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010). However, we did not find any statistically significant associations for occurrence of cancer (excludes skin cancer) with the three Diet Quality Index (DQI)s (Table 2).  Table 3 shows results from univariate and multivariate logistic regression models estimating the associations between the three Diet Quality Index (DQI)s and all-cause mortality.",746dc818-b829-4f4f-a4ef-1ba31b0d3629
29,methods29," Participants in the highest category of AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 (quintile 4 + 5) compared with the lowest category (quintile 1) had lower odds of all-cause mortality at S4 for all women, in univariate analysis.  Comparing participants with the highest and lowest Diet Quality Index (DQI)s category, the odds of having non communicable disease (NCD)s (each disease and multimorbidity) among those who remained in the study at S8 and the odds of all-cause mortality among those who ever had any non communicable disease (NCD) during the study period (S3 to S8) were also consistent (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6).  4.",03b12fe5-ef93-4c09-93dc-c2a09ba00591
30,methods30," Discussion  Within this sample of middle-aged women, statistically significant associations between Diet Quality Index (DQI)s and non communicable disease (NCD)s, multimorbidity, and all-cause mortality were observed: DM (AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 only); HT (all three Diet Quality Index (DQI)s); asthma (AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 only); depression and/or anxiety (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013 and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)); multimorbidity (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013 and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010); and all-cause mortality (AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 only). We also observed an inverse association between Diet Quality Index (DQI)s and coronary heart disease (CHD) only in univariate analysis.  In the current study, a higher AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 score was inversely associated with DM (from S5 to S8), with a lower odd ratio than either Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013 or Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS).",705c16be-725f-457c-a285-a925f03e205c
31,methods31," The inverse association between AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and DM is consistent with previous findings among middle-aged women [27,61] and postmenopausal women [62]. One reason for the stronger inverse association may be the unique components of the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 such as SSBs, red and processed meats, trans-fat, poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and long chain omega-3 fats. Findings from previous studies suggested the increased risk of DM associated with SSBs [63], red and processed meats [64], and trans-fat [65], whereas there is no clear evidence of the preventive role of poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and long chain omega-3 fats intake on DM [66].  We did not find any association between Diet Quality Index (DQI)s and coronary heart disease (CHD) in middle-aged women, after multivariate adjustment (from S5 to S8).",261b9946-4edb-458e-8e8b-50a4750c71b3
32,methods32," These results contrast those of the Nurses’ Health Study (Nurses’ Health Study (NHS)) [27] and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)) cohort aged 45–64 years [67,68], where AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 was inversely associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD). In both our analysis and the European Prospective Investigation into the Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into the Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) cohort [69], coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence was not associated with the Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)). These results contrast with findings from middle-aged women in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) where alternative Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was inversely associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD) (RRQ5-Q1: 0.71, 95% CI 0.62, 0.",f851db8f-4f9f-49ad-bcdb-d63be5e0c0a7
33,methods33,"82) [70] and findings from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort showing that those who adhered to a Mediterranean diet had 16% reduced risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD) [67]. Of interest, there is little range in the measure of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (scored 0–9) compared with other Diet Quality Index (DQI)s (only a 1-point mean difference across quintiles 2–4 in the current study), which may partially explain the lack of association between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and coronary heart disease (CHD).  Previous studies conducted among the middle-aged Australia Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) cohort [71,72] suggested protective effects of three different Diet Quality Index (DQI)s: Dietary Inflammatory Index (Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)) [71]; ARecommended Food Score (RFS) [72]; and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) [72] for HT.",5471f33e-b421-4143-8474-e4cd797b6fdf
34,methods34," The present study has shown that three additional Diet Quality Index (DQI)s were similarly inversely associated with HT. For example, our results showed significantly lower odds of having HT in later surveys (S6–S8) for participants who had the highest Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) quintile, compared with those having the lowest Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) quintile, suggesting possible long-term effect of DQ on HT. All three Diet Quality Index (DQI)s emphasise healthful foods for HT such as fruits [73], vegetables [73], and legumes [74], and include beneficial foods and nutrients for blood pressure (i.e.,Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013: mono unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA); Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS): fish and seafood, and lipid ratio; AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010: omega-3 fatty acids and poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)) [75].",98dca0bf-cc1b-4274-b665-123b62d931f8
35,methods35,"  Previous studies have demonstrated that fruit and vegetables, whole grains, and poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) are beneficial for asthma, and lowering oxidative stress, pulmonary dysfunction, airway inflammation, and allergy [76]. In the present study, we found an inverse association between AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and asthma. In contrast, there was no association between AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and adult-onset asthma among 73,228 female participants from the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) [77], nor among 12,687 adult Latino participants [78]. However, in the French population-based NutriNet-Santè (NNS) cohort study, AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 was inversely associated with asthma symptom score, which assessed the number of respiratory symptoms in the previous 12 months [79].",6b133b51-5e65-45a8-8545-c2ff36f406b9
36,methods36," The discrepant findings could be explained by use of different assessments for dietary exposure such as Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) [77], 24 h dietary recalls [78,79], and outcomes such as dichotomous measure [77] and continuous measure [78,79].  The Diet Quality Index (DQI)s investigated in our study gave points for beneficial foods for non communicable disease (NCD) such as fruit, vegetables [73,80,81,82,83,84], and legumes [74,85,86,87]. Underlying protective mechanisms for cancer may be contributed by (1) antioxidant actions of polyphenols and phytochemicals present in fruit, vegetables and whole grains; and (2) reduction or inhibition of insulin resistance, intestinal absorption of cholesterol and hepatic cholesterol synthesis by fibre present in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes [35]. No association between reported consumption of these foods or nutrients and incident cancer was evident in our study participants.",f9cf7560-4f8e-4c0d-be84-3e9c83a36aea
37,methods37," By contrast, participants in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) scoring in the highest AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 quintile had lower risk of overall cancer compared with their counterparts with lower scores (RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99) [27]. Similarly in the NNS cohort, a 10-point increase in the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 score was associated with a 5% lower risk of overall cancer [88]. These study results tend to align with the current epidemiological findings of inverse association between high DQ and cancer risk [31] and a reduced risk of overall cancer mortality/incidence among those adhering most closely to the Mediterranean diet [89].",059d8286-e5ab-415a-9fb4-e8f925f3179f
38,methods38,"  mono unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and omega-3 fatty acids from fish intake present in the Mediterranean diet may contribute beneficially to depression pathology by playing an integral part in central nervous system membranes, methylation reactions, serotonin, and other neurotransmission, oxidative stress reduction, and anti-inflammation [90]. This has been supported in our study and other studies with follow-ups of 3 years [91], 4.4 years [92], and 12 years [93], but not 8.5 years [90]. However, the Mediterranean style pattern from factor analysis did not show any association with psychological distress measured by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) [93]. The conflicting findings between studies could be explained by different methodological approaches to defining the Mediterranean diet, i.e., priori score ranging 0–9 [90,92,93], factor analysis [91,93].",e567ce30-ef76-4105-b3c4-6a20d8c51692
39,methods39,"  There are few studies investigating the association between dietary factors and multimorbidity [94,95,96,97,98], particularly in middle-aged women. Shi et al. (2014) reported that the relative odds of multimorbidity were increased for those who consumed soft drink > 0.5 litre per day compared with those who did not consume soft drinks (OR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.68, 2.45) [94]. Protective effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on multimorbidity have been observed in cross-sectional [95,96] and prospective [97,98,99] studies. Among European participants, the relative odds of multimorbidity decreased for those who adhered to modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) compared with who did not [40,100]. We observed lower odds of multimorbidity among those with higher DQ assessed by Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013 (at S8) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 (at S7, S8), but not with Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS).",d0153f69-1a40-4c48-b9cc-ce3043630ee0
40,methods40,"  An inverse association between AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) (including AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010) and all-cause mortality has been established [31,67,101]. In our cohort, women in the highest category of AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 had a lower risk of all-cause mortality at S4 in univariate analysis, but this disappeared when covariates were controlled for. Cumulative evidence from 29 cohort studies reported the relationship between Mediterranean diet adherence and reduction in all-cause mortality [38]; however, there was still conflicting evidence among studies using the scoring system proposed by Trichopoulou et al., score ranging 0–9 [53]. Inverse association between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and mortality have been reported in Dutch women [102], in the European Prospective Investigation into the Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort [103], and an Australian cohort [104].",60b52d77-59b6-4bf6-a7bc-e9b83c45de53
41,methods41," By contrast, no association between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and all-cause mortality was observed in US participants [105], Swiss women [106], and Caucasian participants [107]. It may be that the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) does not adequately differentiate DQ in populations that do not regularly follow a Mediterranean dietary pattern [108].  Analysis of the overall diet through three Diet Quality Index (DQI)s with different descriptions, compositions and construction criteria based on our recent systematic review and critical appraisal [48] is a strength of the current study. Diet Quality Index (DQI)s can evaluate the quality and/or variety of the overall diet and the agreement with national dietary guidelines or specific dietary patterns, and importantly, they can be used to explore diet–health relationships [14].",0a5e06af-159a-4496-9063-76803b4a9d09
42,methods42," In the present study, AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, the most up-to-date version based on the current scientific evidence, was most frequently associated with reduced odds of having more non communicable disease (NCD)s. Another strength is that the study was based on a prospective study of nationally representative middle-aged Australian women, who were free of non communicable disease (NCD) before the start of the study.  There are some limitations that need to be considered. First, compared with originally recruited women at S1 (n = 13,714), women who were excluded from the analysis due to incomplete Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) at S3 (n = 593, approximately 11% of S3 sample) were more likely to have no formal education, no paid job, difficulty managing on income, be less physically active, have poor self-rated health, and take over the counter (OTC) medicine (Supplementary Table S4).",e8e804ed-c6f6-46c9-9bd0-ec23543724e7
43,methods43," This could affect the representativeness of middle-aged women and generalisability of this study. Excluding women who were the least healthy and had poor diet could reduce the ability to observe association, likely biasing towards the null. Second, the measurement of diet was only conducted at S3 and S7; therefore, we assumed Diet Quality Index (DQI)s were constant during the 15-year follow-up. DQ between these two surveys has been shown to be relatively consistent for this cohort [47]; therefore, we believe this is a reasonable assumption. Third, the non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes in our study relied on self-reported data that may be biased; however, their reliability and validity against administrative data has been reported [54,109]. Fourth, the low number of cases for our outcomes at each survey, particularly in all-cause mortality, might lead to increased uncertainty in our estimates obtained from regression models.",5225a6cd-f80b-4c7a-9622-9afd19de6b9d
44,methods44," Lastly, despite the use of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)s to inform covariate selection for the multivariate analysis, residual confounding is still possible. Given the repeated cross-sectional study design the covariates were reported at the same surveys as the outcome measures; however, some of these measures (e.g., medication use) may reflect changes that occurred after the non communicable disease (NCD) diagnosis.  5. Conclusions  Higher DQ was inversely associated with incident non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes within a sample of middle-aged Australian women. The different theoretical approaches reflected in three Diet Quality Index (DQI)s, i.e., ADG-2013 for Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013, and specific dietary patterns for Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, may have different implications.",777582c9-d6b6-49d9-be87-d0724728b3ce
45,methods45," Our findings suggested that DQ is an important predictor of some non communicable disease (NCD)s and applicable in non communicable disease (NCD) prevention: Healthy Eating Index (HEI)FA-2013 for HT, depression and/or anxiety, and multimorbidity; Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) for HT and depression and/or anxiety; and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 for DM, HT, asthma, and multimorbidity. Specific dietary patterns captured by different Diet Quality Index (DQI) may be useful in setting behaviour change goals for the prevention of non communicable disease (NCD)s and multimorbidity.
