0,abstract0," To better understand the role of individual and lifestyle factors in human disease, an exposome‐wide association study was performed to investigate within a single‐study anthropometry measures and lifestyle factors previously associated with B‐cell lymphoma (B‐cell lymphoma (BCL)). Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition study, 2402 incident B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) cases were diagnosed from 475 426 participants that were followed‐up on average 14 years. Standard and penalized Cox regression models as well as principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) were used to evaluate 84 exposures in relation to B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) risk. Standard and penalized Cox regression models showed a positive association between anthropometric measures and B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and multiple myeloma/plasma cell neoplasm (MM).",17d851fa-c60b-44f2-aa27-964262b4ea86
1,abstract1," The penalized Cox models additionally showed the association between several exposures from categories of physical activity, smoking status, medical history, socioeconomic position, diet and B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and/or the subtypes. principal component analysis (PCA)s confirmed the individual associations but also showed additional observations. The PC5 including anthropometry, was positively associated with B‐cell lymphoma (BCL), diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL)) and MM. There was a significant positive association between consumption of sugar and confectionary (PC11) and follicular lymphoma risk, and an inverse association between fish and shellfish and Vitamin D (PC15) and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) risk.",2dcfdcf2-ffab-41eb-ba6d-6c98eba63fbb
2,abstract2," The PC1 including features of the Mediterranean diet and diet with lower inflammatory score showed an inverse association with B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) risk, while the PC7, including dairy, was positively associated with B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) risk. Physical activity (PC10) was positively associated with DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) risk among women. This study provided informative insights on the etiology of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL).  What's new?  The “exposome” includes all non‐genetic exposures (e.g. diet, viral, environmental, etc.), with the goal of understanding how those exposures may affect an individual's health. In this study, the authors used a technique called “environment‐wide association study (EWAS)” (exposome‐wide association study) to identify multiple factors that are associated with B‐cell lymphoma (B‐cell lymphoma (BCL)) risk. Their results confirm both previously reported risk factors and protective factors.",1f4467ef-c054-4014-ba2e-a75a661b20f6

The rationale and study design have been described previously. 12 , 13 In brief, 521 324 subjects, mostly aged 30 to 70 years, were recruited between 1992 and 2000. Ethical review boards from International Agency for Research on Cancer (International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)) and local participating centers approved the study and all participants gave their written informed consent.",72a4f325-f108-4de5-a290-85e70de4dacf

This left a cohort of 475 426 subjects, including 2402 incident B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and 473 024 participants free of cancer.  Validated country‐specific questionnaires were used to collect information on the usual diet during the year before recruitment; namely through self‐administered semi‐quantitative food frequency questionnaires or diet history questionnaires administered through a personal interview, and semi‐quantitative food‐frequency questionnaires combined with a food record.",c69867ce-a4fb-4b3a-bef5-1b904360e8f0
16,methods2," 13 , 14 Lifestyle questionnaires were used to obtain information on sociodemographic characteristics, physical activity, medical history and alcohol and tobacco consumption. Anthropometric measures were also ascertained at recruitment. 15  2.1 Follow‐up and outcome assessment  Primary incident lymphoma cancer cases were identified by linkage with national cancer registries in Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. A combination of methods were used in France, Germany and Greece, including cancer registries, health insurance records, and active follow‐up contacting participants or their next‐of‐kin. Mortality data were retrieved from regional or national mortality registries. The follow‐up period was defined from the age at recruitment to the age at first lymphoma diagnosis, death or last complete follow‐up (December 31, 2013), depending on which occurred first.",c3e81901-48cc-40b9-9623-13f3c635c1ed
17,methods3,"  Diagnoses of primary incident lymphoma cases were based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third edition and grouped according to recommendations of the InterLymph Pathology Working Group. 1 In the current analysis, only mature B‐cell lymphomas (Table S1) were considered, which were further categorized into diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL)), follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)) (including small lymphocytic leukemia), multiple myeloma/plasma cell neoplasm (MM), and “other” entities (ie, those cases in which the B‐cell lymphoma subtype is unknown or does not fall within the above‐mentioned subtypes).  2.2 Exposures assessment per category  Anthropometry measures included height, weight, hip circumference, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) and waist to hip ratio.",9556d4f9-0f8b-4bed-badb-9a9eee1b36cd
18,methods4," Participants' height, weight, hip circumference and waist circumference were measured at baseline, except for France, Oxford and Norway, where self‐reported measures were obtained via questionnaire. 15 , 16 , 17  Smoking status included ever smoking, current smoking, currently smoking cigarettes, currently smoking cigars, duration of smoking, duration of cigarettes smoking, >15/d currently smoked cigarettes and >25/d currently smoked cigarettes.  Alcohol intake: Data on alcohol intake were collected through the dietary questionnaire (alcohol intake over 12 months prior to recruitment) and in the lifestyle questionnaire (consumption of alcoholic beverages at different ages in the past) and expressed in grams of ethanol per day (g/d).  Medical history: Participants stated whether they had ever had myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, reported a cardiovascular problem.

19,methods5," 18 , 19 , 20 Current occupational physical activity was based on employment status and on the level of physical activity at current work, which was later coded in categories (sedentary occupation, standing occupation, manual work, heavy manual work and unemployed). Information on housework, do‐it‐yourself work, gardening and climbing stairs was combined to estimate the overall household activities and walking, cycling and sport activities were combined to determine the overall recreational activities. Subsequently, energy expenditure using metabolic equivalent values was calculated, according to the Compendium of Physical Activities. 21 Sex‐specific total physical activity index, Cambridge physical activity index (1‐4 levels) and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) physical activity score (1‐3 levels) were also included in current analyses.",bf3c1142-2cfa-4879-8a06-b8734466d44a

Nutrient: Nutrient values of all items from the 24‐hour dietary recalls were standardized to build the European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer cohort (EPIC) Nutrient Database. 22 For each nutrient, the nutrient density was calculated by dividing the caloric value of that nutrient by the total caloric intake. For nutrients without caloric value (vitamins, flavonoids, cholesterol, calcium), the weight of the nutrient was divided by the total caloric intake.  Dietary pattern: The Mediterranean diet (MD) score was assessed using the adapted relative MD (arMED) score.",d5028b4e-0e85-49b1-b905-4a789b814bdb
21,methods7," 23 , 24 In brief, the arMED is a 16‐point linear score that incorporates eight key dietary components: six components presumed to reflect the MD [fruit (including nuts and seeds), vegetables, legumes, fish (including seafood), olive oil and cereals] and two components consumed in low quantity in the MD (dairy products and meat). The sum of these points was used to define the MED score, that ranged from 0 to 16 (from the lowest to the highest adherence). 24 The dietary inflammatory potential was assessed by means of an inflammatory score of the diet (inflammatory score of the diet (ISD)), calculated using 28 dietary components and their corresponding inflammatory weights. 25 , 26 Overall, the inflammatory score of the diet (ISD) is a relative index that categorizes individual's diets from maximally anti‐inflammatory (corresponding to lower scores) to maximally pro‐inflammatory (higher values).",99f529b8-ded8-470a-8a5c-b4e79bc78ec2
22,methods8,"  Socioeconomic position (Socioeconomic position (SEP)): Educational level (primary school or less, technical/professional school, secondary school, longer education including university degree) was used as an indirect measure of Socioeconomic position (SEP). A particular advantage of investigating education is avoiding reverse causation bias: diseases may lead to downward occupational mobility and reduced income, but generally will not affect educational status achieved by early adulthood.  2.3 Statistical analyses  Table S2 shows the list of 84 exposure variables included in the study. Exposure variables with <25% missing data (Table S3) were imputed based on a maximum likelihood estimation method which was informed by the observed correlation structure within the data. To understand the structure of our data and see which exposures are related to each other, we calculated Spearman rank correlation between each two variables adjusted for age, sex and country.",fcfded78-1af0-4d26-8039-e465f7e463db
23,methods9," Spearman correlation coefficients were visualized with a heatmap where variables were arranged using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The larger the correlation between a pair of variables, the closer in proximity they appear in the heatmap. Absolute correlations below 0.2 were omitted and remaining correlations were plotted in a “circus” plot.  Univariate and age‐, sex‐, and country‐adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between each exposure and B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and its subtypes. Subsequently, to examine country heterogeneity, we fitted each model per country (age and sex adjusted) and pooled the estimates by conducting a random‐effects meta‐analysis. The coefficient of inconsistency I 2 was used as a metric to assess heterogeneity between countries, with a P value <.05 to be regarded as statistically significant evidence for between country heterogeneity.",b2cb7568-9d83-4f36-b59c-7def2beef7a4
24,methods10," Cox analyses were stratified by sex and median age at recruitment (≤55, >55 years). Sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding cases with less than 2 years of follow‐up (n = 176 cases) and centers with self‐reported anthropometry data (France, Oxford and Norway) and without comprehensive physical activity data (Norway, Umea).  Given the correlation between exposures, univariate regression analysis is prone to increased false positive results. 27 Therefore, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)) technique, a multivariable penalized regression algorithm, 28 , 29 to identify exposures associated with B‐cell lymphoma (BCL). least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique is a powerful method that performs two main tasks: regularization and feature selection.",71889c7c-cc98-42db-a4e5-63720e22096e
25,methods11," In order to do so, the method applies a shrinking (regularization) process in which the coefficients of the regression variables are penalized, thus shrinking some of them to zero. During the feature selection process, the variables that still have a nonzero coefficient after shrinkage are selected to be part of the model. Optimal tuning parameter λ, which controls the strength of the penalty, was obtained by 5‐fold cross‐validation. All exposures were standardized. Dummy variables were defined for country and together with age and sex were forced into the “regularized” Cox model by decreasing their penalty factor to zero. We also applied an Elastic‐Net approach 29 that combines the penalties of ridge and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regressions to get the best of both. The method effectively shrinks coefficients (similar to ridge regression) and set some coefficients to zero, like in least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO).",a81e7f78-e632-466e-b65e-6d2fb56cbbb2
26,methods12," As the results were similar to the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique, we therefore present the former.  Finally, PC analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) was applied to reduce the spectrum of the exposures into a smaller number of clusters of related exposures. Varimax orthogonal rotation method was performed for principal component analysis (PCA) ensuring absence of redundancy, and component scores were calculated for each individual. Components with eigenvalue >1 were included. age‐, gender‐, country‐adjusted Cox regression was performed on B‐cell lymphoma status for all PCs separately and collectively. Moreover, Cox analyses were stratified by sex and median age at recruitment (≤55, >55 years).

The associations between height and weight and B‐cell lymphoma (BCL), weight and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and consumption of sugar and confectionary and FL were present among women.  3.3 Penalized Cox regression  least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models confirmed the reported findings of the standard Cox model for B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and the subtypes and selected additional exposures associated to B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and/or DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) (Table 2).",51fe0aad-9c4b-4ded-866f-42595e3c46af
34,results6," Intake of dairy products, total fats with animal origin, physical activity, manual work, currently smoking >25/d and history of myocardial infarction were positively associated with risk of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and/or DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) while intake of condiments and sauces, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fruit, nuts and seeds, Vitamin D and retinol, history of hypertension and stroke, standing occupation, education, current smoker and currently smoke cigars were negatively associated with risk of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and/or DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL).

35,results8," Regression coefficients were obtained at lambda minimum (the value of λ at the lowest cross‐validation error). Positive coefficients indicate that an exposure is associated with higher risk of lymphoma, and vice versa for negative coefficients. See Table S2 for name, type and unit of the exposures.

The exposures in total population were merged into 22 PCs with eigenvalue>1 explaining 78.5% of the data variation (Figure 2, Table S8).",6d7f4e23-d950-4d5e-b102-5e07f08f0dd9
36,results9," As shown in Figure 2, all exposures were correlated with one of the PCs without much overlap. In multivariable Cox models adjusted for age, sex and country, we found six PCs (PC5, PC7, PC10, PC11, PC12 and PC15) reached to significance of 0.05 in relation to B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and/or subtypes, among which PC5 including anthropometry measures was significant after multiple testing correction (Table S9). Multivariable Cox models mutually adjusted for other PCs essentially showed the same PCs, except for PC12, which was characterized by high water and nonalcoholic beverage consumption and no longer associated with MM after mutual adjustment for other PCs (Table 3). Moreover, we found a lower risk of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) related to PC1, which includes certain dietary features of the MD and diet with lower inflammatory score.",9e6f00d5-6429-41fe-b348-8fa3521b88d7
37,results10," PC15 including consumption of fish, shellfish and Vitamin D showed a protective effect on DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) while consumption of dairy products, calcium and phosphorus (PC7) were related to increased risk of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL). The PC10 involving physical activity variables was associated with increased risk of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL). Higher consumption of sugar, confectionery and carbohydrate products (PC11) increased FL risk. Majority of the selected exposures by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were among those present in the significant PCs. This indicates that these individual exposures were actually part of a broader construct and should be interpreted in that context.  FIGURE 2 A heatmap for the correlation of each exposure with each principal component.",d0c40d8f-b820-4513-8fde-9c957d944711
38,results20," Moreover, sensitivity analyses excluding centers with self‐reported anthropometry data and centers without comprehensive physical activity data (n = 178 106) did not change the reported association between anthropometry and B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and MM, and between physical activity and B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) (data not shown).  4 ",888c3680-d634-4c1a-a39a-6713c76afc05
39,discussion0,"  In this large prospective cohort study, several anthropometric measures and lifestyle factors were associated with B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and/or subtypes, with strong evidence for a positive association of anthropometric measures.  In our study, we used a new exposome‐based approach to find risk factors of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL). It consisted of four analytical parts: investigating the data structure, standard and penalized Cox regression methods to find exposures robustly associated to the risk of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL), and a principal component analysis (PCA) to see how the exposures are related.",77716e36-8637-49e0-836b-91e7bc2bac79
40,discussion1," A multivariable penalized regression analysis, like least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), is preferable over a regression model considering each individual exposure variable separately, since least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) has been previously shown to have a more favorable tradeoff between sensitivity and the false discovery proportion in exposome data. 27 , 30 With least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), a model is created where the effect of each exposure is adjusted for the effect of other associated exposures, while penalizing the nonassociated exposures to null. It has been shown that in the presence of correlated influential variables, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) will select at most one of them. 30 Associated exposures are penalized to zero or even show a reverse association.",3b3112bb-b3ed-4c1f-b81a-3cb1d460109b
41,discussion2," Therefore, we also performed principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate which exposures are correlated and have potentially a combined effect.  Several anthropometry variables reflecting obesity (ie, weight, hip circumference, and BMI) as well as height were positively associated with B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and/or subtypes in our study and previous investigations. 2 , 31 , 32 , 33 There are several potential mechanisms whereby obesity may increase the risk of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL). Impaired immune function, chronic inflammatory response, effects on cell proliferation and changes in the metabolism of endogenous hormones, leading to a distortion in the normal balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis are some of the postulated putative biological mechanisms. 2 , 31 , 33 Height per se does not cause cancer, but could act as a marker for genotype or environmental exposures that could influence immune system function.",0c72b0ed-8d3d-42a3-8c78-0cb407bf3de9
42,discussion3," 33 , 34 Height is a proxy for cell division and total cell reservoir. Larger bodies contain more cells than smaller bodies and therefore have a greater chance that a cell will undergo malignant transformation, escape the body's cancer defense mechanisms, and progress to cancer. 33 Moreover, height might be related to cancer risk through increased cell turnover mediated by growth factors. 33  Based on epidemiologic reports, there is growing evidence that diet plays a role in lymphomagenesis although the data for B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) subtypes are scarce. This study provides more support for the role of nutrition in lymphoma. In our study, consumption of sugar, confectionary, and carbohydrates products was associated with increased risk of FL, particularly among female participants.",8461b924-78dd-4338-8919-51709bd27ba1
43,discussion4," The majority of previous prospective and case‐controls studies on total carbohydrates or the main food sources of carbohydrates and lymphoma risk were null except a positive association reported between high consumption of white bread or pasta and non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)). 35 Although sugar intake was not associated with non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 36 in a follow‐up study, women who frequently consumed cakes or pies were associated with an elevated risk for non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 37 Studying dietary glycemic index and glycemic load in further studies are warranted to clarify this association. 38  We found that consumption of dairy products, calcium, riboflavin (B2) and phosphorus may increase the risk of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL), in particular among females. Previous studies suggested a positive association between dairy products and risk of non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 39 , 40 particularly for DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL).",7b96d81c-31de-4a95-81eb-b51401ef4e25
44,discussion5," 41 Milk is a source of fat and protein, which are both thought to be risk factors for non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 39 as well as calcium, riboflavin and Vitamin A. 35 The positive association between dairy consumption and risk of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) may be attributed to the effects of dietary calcium and phosphorus, largely found in dairy products, which decrease levels of 1,25(OH)2 Vitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]. 1,25(OH)2 D, the physiologically active form of Vitamin D, is considered an anticarcinogen because it promotes differentiation and apoptosis and inhibits cell growth in preneoplastic and neoplastic cells. Moreover, association between Vitamin D3 and autophagy and activation of antibacterial peptides have been reported.",ffd5290f-c30d-426c-9cd7-8df809c0e29f
45,discussion6," 42 , 43 Although a recent pooled study did not support the hypothesis that elevated circulating Vitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration is associated with a reduced risk of non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 44 another study suggested that 25(OH)D insufficiency was associated with inferior survival in DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and T‐cell lymphoma. 45 Another mechanism involves presence of organochlorines such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls in dairy fat, which are well‐known human carcinogens and immunotoxins and can alter normal B‐cell responses. Finally, bovine leukemia virus associated with lymphosarcoma in cattle may be transmitted through milk to humans, although there is no clear evidence of human infection.  Our study also suggested a possible inverse association between consumption of fish, shellfish and Vitamin D and the risk of DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL). Previous reports on fish consumption and risk of lymphoma have yielded inconsistent findings.",7c4a64a2-a625-45c3-9065-bc5c955e0aa1
46,discussion7," Possible reasons for discrepancies across studies may reflect varying levels of organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls compounds that have been associated with increased risk of non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Thus, adverse health effects related to their high content in some fish may diminish the otherwise protective effects conferred by fish consumption. 39  We found a possible association between the consumption of animal fats (positive association) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (inverse association) and risk of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL). Many studies suggest that high‐fat diets are linked to the etiology of non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A recent meta‐analysis showed a significant association between total fat consumption and increased risk of non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL), but not for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and FL.",5af37b8d-f992-4fa7-a752-46113fc7835f
47,discussion8," 46 They found that only high animal fat consumption increases the risk for non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with no association with vegetable fat consumption. 46 A more recent large prospective study, reported increased risk of non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) associated with intakes of total, animal, saturated and trans fat with 14 years of follow‐up. However, these associations did not persist with longer follow‐up. 47 Animal fats are comprised of saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fats, whereas vegetable fat has a higher concentration of unsaturated fatty acids. A diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to reduce the levels of pro‐inflammatory markers such as interleukin (IL)‐6, IL‐1 receptor antagonist, tumor necrosis factor, and C‐reactive protein, as well as increased levels of anti‐inflammatory factors, such as IL‐10 and transforming growth factor.",c44d5bf1-ebab-436b-88d3-8ff18cb938a5
48,discussion9," 48 On the other hand, saturated fats can modulate immune function by enhancing nuclear factor‐κB activation and antiapoptotic behavior in T cells, in addition to increasing expression of pro‐inflammatory agents such as IL‐6, cyclooxygenase‐2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. 39 A few studies suggest that the link might be related to changes in serum levels of leptin and adiponectin that stimulate proliferation and inhibit apoptosis through PI3K/AKT activation. 46  We previously showed that B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) risk was associated with a higher inflammatory score of the diet (ISD) and a lower adherence to MD, 24 , 26 which was confirmed in the present study. The role of inflammation, immune dysregulation and autoimmunity are known in the pathogenesis of lymphoma.",164cde60-02b2-4157-8c41-746cd59566ac
49,discussion10," 49 Recent studies further support the inflammatory potential of diet 50 ; in particular, for lymphoid neoplasms, positive associations have been recently reported between a pro‐inflammatory dietary score and non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 51 The MD, one of the healthiest traditional dietary patterns, is a plant‐based pattern, where vegetables, fruits, cereals (preferably as whole grain), legumes and nuts are consumed in high amount and frequency. It provides a diet rich in flavonoids, carotenoids and Vitamin C or E, whose important antioxidant properties can neutralize free radicals or prevent DNA damage. 52 , 53  Moreover, our study suggests a possible beneficial effect of condiments and sauces intake on B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL). Spices, condiments and sauces cover a broad range of substances with different characteristics.",f7cb0810-96d0-4931-87c3-65b6438fac8b
50,discussion11," Research indicates that some herbs and spices, or their bioactive components, may act alone or in concert to reduce cancer risk through their antimicrobial, antioxidant and antitumorigenic properties, as well as their direct suppressive effect on carcinogen bioactivation. Nevertheless, the evidence to date with herbs and spices is inconsistent and warrants greater attention. 54  We found that physical activity (PC10) was positively associated with B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL). Sex stratified analyses showed that the association with DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) was limited to the female participants. It should be noted that women reported lower levels of physical activity (in general) and more household activity compared with men in our study. However, it is not clear how physical activity positively influences DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) risk.",e488e293-18ad-4626-9884-986e1aa5d9fa
51,discussion12," Considering the increased risk of DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) for manual work among women (Table S7), we cannot exclude bias due to some unknown harmful co‐exposures such as household pollutants during physical activities to female participants. Our Cox regression models also suggested a positive association between recreational physical activity and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) risk. Exposure to environmental pollutants especially during outdoor recreational physical activity (ie, passive exposure to volatile organic compounds and other chemicals) also cannot be excluded. The results of previous prospective investigations are inconsistent, probably due to the lack of reliable, valid and comprehensive measures of physical activity.",1f5e65b6-0bb1-49f9-ac4d-ad4f27d9ae61
52,discussion13," 55 Despite of the relative validity and reproducibility of the physical activity questions across the countries in the European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer cohort (EPIC) study, 20 some degree of measurement error and misclassification is likely. Further studies that also incorporate environmental and occupational exposures are needed.  Our study also suggests that heavy smoking (>25 per day) may increase the risk of DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL). A pooled analysis of case‐control studies within the InterLymph consortium showed that current smoking was associated with a significant 30% increased risk of FL, but not non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) overall or other non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes. 56 Moreover, a meta‐analysis of seven prospective studies 57 did not show association between cigarette smoking and non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).",550e7d26-d005-4381-bb5f-433db18157a0
53,discussion14," Several factors may explain these inconsistencies including methodological differences in the studies (ie, study design, data collection, categorizations and residual confounding) and differences in population in terms of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and disease prevalence. Therefore, further research to pursue the association is warranted. One promising direction for future investigation includes refining our understanding of the carcinogens in cigarette smoke and their biological effects that could plausibly contribute to lymphomagenesis. 58  An inverse association between alcohol intake and B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) has been consistently observed in both large case‐control 2 and prospective studies. 59 However, it has been hypothesized that this association is driven by unknown confounders. Unlike previous large observational studies, our study did not show the protective effect of alcohol intake in B‐cell lymphoma (BCL).",0b644bbe-399a-46df-9768-41f40ad03a33
54,discussion15," In contrast, our findings suggested a positive association between alcohol intake (PC9) and FL among women after adjustment for other PCs (HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.04‐1.46) (Table 4). Due to insufficient power of the stratified analyses, this finding should be interpreted with caution and further prospective studies are deemed necessary.  The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses showed an inverse association between level of education and risk of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL). Limited and contradictory literature is published about educational level or other Socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators and lymphoma risk. 60 , 61 In line with our findings the InterLymph study showed lower risk of lymphoma and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) among highly educated people. 2 Populations with low Socioeconomic position (SEP) may be more exposed to hazard occupational exposures, air pollution, smoking and infections which can increase the risk of lymphoma.",5ccd22a9-c308-4b72-9f0f-d3a57c4137d1
55,discussion16,"  Penalized Cox models revealed an inverse association between history of hypertension and B‐cell lymphoma (BCL). We recently reported also a negative association with hypertension and with both, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer cohort (EPIC) for all‐type lymphomas and for the subgroup of non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 62 Inflammatory processes play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Different subpopulations of immune cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses are involved in inflammatory processes and exert their effects in part via production of various pro‐inflammatory and anti‐inflammatory cytokines, 63 so there may be some mechanistic explanation, but this would need a more detailed investigation.  The strengths of this study include its prospective design, long follow‐up, and large size which allowed us to carry out analyses by B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) subentities.",0ff2fc83-d17b-400a-82d3-1ee9f56c362d
56,discussion17," Limitations of our study should be considered when interpreting the results, including potential measurement errors derived from questionnaires, which could lead to systematic and random errors. We cannot rule out that they have affected risk estimates. Our study lacked data on other exposures such as medication, occupational exposures, family history of hematological cancers and medical history of immunologic disorders and viral infections which are among the most important risk factors. In addition, we were unable to take into account any possible changes in dietary and lifestyle habits over time. Although reverse causation could be induced by changes of lifestyle behaviors before recruitment because of early symptoms, after exclusion of the first 2 years of follow‐up, associations were unchanged, possibly indicating a minor role of reverse causation.",9caa0951-51ad-459c-9022-5d70e8ca1c4c
57,discussion18," Furthermore, despite the large number of observed incident cases of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL), this study might not have sufficient power to detect significant associations within the B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) subtypes with a lower number of cases, in particular in the sex and age stratified analyses. Finally, despite multiple‐testing corrections, we cannot exclude chance findings.  In conclusion, our systematic evaluation confirmed several previously reported risk factors (anthropometric measures, animal fat, dairy and sugar intake) as well as protective factors (MD, diet with lower inflammatory score, fish and Vitamin D, Socioeconomic position (SEP)) of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and/or subtypes.",6797249c-654a-46f3-8c54-c241ab97c669
58,discussion19," While our study did not support the previously reported protective effect of alcohol intake on B‐cell lymphoma (BCL), it revealed several unknown associations (increased risk of DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL) with smoking and a beneficial effect of condiments and sauces intake for B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and DLB‐cell lymphoma (BCL)). In this study, we applied a comprehensive approach for conceptualizing the roles and relationships of multiple exposures in the etiology of B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) and could generate some new insight in B‐cell lymphoma (BCL) risk factors. This highlights that traditional approaches of testing single association at a time could be suboptimal compared with a environment‐wide association study (EWAS) approach.
