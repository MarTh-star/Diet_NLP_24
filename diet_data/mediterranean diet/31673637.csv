0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design and Participants The overall study design, intervention strategies and primary outcomes of the Feeding America’s Bravest trial have been previously reported [32]. Briefly, Feeding America’s Bravest is a step-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial within the 44 stations of Indianapolis Fire Department, which aims to compare a MedDiet Nutritional Intervention vs. an ad libitum Midwestern-style diet (control or no intervention) during 12 months. Group 1 (or the intervention group for 12 months) continued under a self-sustained continuation phase for another 12 months. Group 2 (initially controls) crossed over (at 12 months) to receive the active Mediterranean Diet Nutritional Intervention for 6 months followed by another 6 months of a self-sustained intervention phase.",c7d0f04f-debc-4572-b464-d7cfc669f510
1,methods1," For this nested study, we randomly selected a sub-group of participants (n = 48) whose fire stations had been assigned to the MedDiet intervention (n = 24) or the control group (n = 24) for the previous 12 months. At that time (time point 1 for our study and 12 months follow up of the parent study), the intervention group (Group 1) continued under a self-sustained phase for another 6 months (time point 2 for our study or 18 months of the parent study) and the control group underwent the active MedDiet intervention for 6 months. Plasma metabolic biomarkers were analyzed at the two time points (Figure 1). The overarching Feeding America’s Bravest protocol was approved by the Harvard Institutional Review Board (IRB16-0170) and is registered at Clinical Trials (NCT02941757). All participants provided informed consent for participation.  2.2.",e0054b4d-7dc1-4df7-bfb1-73bd1a60c031
2,methods2," Mediterranean Diet Intervention At the two time points of this study, data on sociodemographic characteristics, physical activity, sleep behaviors (a modified Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, where on a scale from 0 to 7 participants were asked to identify the statement which option best described their habitual level of physical activity over the past month [33]), food consumption based on a self- reported validated food frequency questionnaire [34] and a modified Mediterranean Diet scale [35], and anthropometric and clinical variables were assessed.  The MedDiet intervention has been described in detail elsewhere [32].",21ae6d25-b8d9-4fc9-b85a-e45c22032388
3,methods3," Briefly, it consisted of educational sessions and videos created by a certified nutritionist, leaflet and recommendations about the Mediterranean Dietand lifestyle, firefighter-tailored Mediterranean recipes (by modifying Firefighters´ favorite recipes according to the MedDiet principles by a chef and a nutritionist), in-site chef cooking demonstration, a firefighters’ food pyramid, Mediterranean food samples and discount coupons to a large supermarket chain for specific Mediterranean Diet-compatible foods [32].  Adherence to the MedDiet was assessed by the validated modified Mediterranean Diet Score (mMDS) [35,36] and the Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score.",badde06c-023c-406a-85c0-307403e61e4e
4,methods4," (36) The mMDS range from 0 (lowest) to 51 (highest conformity to the MedDiet) [36] and consists of 13 domains including consumption of fast food, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, sweet desserts, fried foods, ocean fish, breads and starches (consumed at home and the fire station), the type and frequency of alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic beverages (consumed at home and the fire station) and the type of cooking oil or fat (consumed at home and the fire station). Each component ranged from 0 (less adherence) to 4 points (better adherence) except the type of alcohol (wine; 0–2 points) and the type of cooking oil or fat (0–5 points). Weighted scores was considered for domains evaluated at both the homes and fire stations based on the percentage of meals consumed at each location [36].",bbc2e429-3594-4c80-b8e8-0fc5e267ece3
5,methods5,"  The Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score [37] consists of 14 questions; 12 of them are about food consumption frequency (olive oil consumption, vegetables, fruits, red/processed meats, butter/margarine, soda drinks, wine, legumes, fish/seafood, nuts, commercial sweets, sofrito consumption), and another two about food intake habits considered characteristic of the Spanish Mediterranean Diet (preference of poultry consumption instead of red meats, use of olive oil as main culinary fat). Each question was scored 0 or 1, with a total possible range of 0 to 14; higher scores indicate greater adherence to the MedDiet.  2.3.",5d12aa59-02cd-4654-8449-0253e7254d9f
6,methods6," Collection of Plasma Samples In this nested study, 12 h fasting blood samples were collected at time point 1 (baseline for this metabolomics study and 12 months for the trial) and time point 2 (6 months follow up for this metabolomics study and 18 months for the trial) of follow up; samples were kept cold and immediately processed to separate the plasma with a refrigerated centrifuge. Next, the 200 µL cryovials were placed at −80 °C.  2.4. Plasma Biomarkers Measurements Metabolites were quantified in plasma samples from 83 individuals that had optimal values using high-throughput proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)) metabolomics (Nightingale Health Ltd., Helsinki, Finland). This method provides simultaneous quantification of routine lipids, lipoprotein subclass profiling with lipid concentrations within 14 subclasses, fatty acid composition, and various low-molecular metabolites including amino acids, ketone bodies and glycolysis-related metabolites.",28dd7845-cf6f-46e4-bacb-9612b3a2eae7
7,methods7," Details of the experimentation and applications of the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolomics platform have been described previously [38]. All measured metabolites fall in the range of detection; representative coefficients of variations (CVs) for the metabolic biomarkers were published previously [39,40].  2.5. Statistical Analysis Differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups were examined by t-test ANOVA for continuous variables (means ± standard deviation [SD]) or Chi-square for categorical data (percentages). Statistical analyses of the metabolites were performed on log-transformed data that were scaled to SD units to facilitate comparisons across metabolites. The effect of the MedDiet intervention between point 1 and point 2 in this analysis (6 months) was assessed using a linear mixed-effects model adjusted for age and sex.",4cd961d5-6c95-4920-b48a-d18d4fe80c62
8,methods8," As many of the metabolites are biologically correlated, applying a multiple testing correction using all the 225 biomarkers would be too strict. Thus, account for multiple testing, Bonferroni correction was applied with significance level defined as 0.05/21 = 0.002, with 21 being the number of principal components that explained 99% of the variation in the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data.  Cross-sectional linear associations between the adherence to the mMDS score and metabolite concentrations at both time points for both the MedDiet intervention and control groups were obtained using a linear regression model adjusted for age and sex. The analyses were performed using ggforestplot R package (version 0.0.2) and the linear mixed-effects model was fitted with the nlme R package (version 3.1.-144).  3. Results 3.1. Participant Characteristics Characteristics of the 48 participants at time point 1, and changes after 6 months follow up (time point 2), are summarized in Table 1.",f6479e19-9365-4452-9bc8-38ba0fea6449
9,methods9," Of the 48 participants at time point 1, 44 (92%) were followed up and provided dietary information and anthropometric measures at time point 2. Information for the plasma metabolites were available for n = 47 at baseline and n = 36 at the end of follow up (Supplementary Materials Figure S1). There were no statistically significant differences in the adherence to the mMDS or Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score at time 1 and after the 6 months follow up within and between groups. Similarly, no differences were seen for age or sex (Table 1).  3.2. The 6 Month Effect of the MedDiet Intervention Figure 2 shows the 6 months effects of the intervention in the most relevant metabolites pathways. Data on the effect of the intervention in all the metabolites studied by group are presented in Table S1. The main subgroups affected by the intervention were the lipids and lipoproteins.",860ff25a-d484-4dc1-a7fa-e716402676f7
10,methods10," Specifically, we observed a reduction in LDL-C, ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, remnant cholesterol, and higher HDL-C, and other subfractions such as lower cholesterol in L-VLDL-C, S-VLDL-C, L-LDL-C, M-LDL-C, S-LDL-C lipoproteins, and the composition of the lipoproteins after 6 months of intervention. Of note, these associations did not reach statistical significance after correcting the p-values for multiple testing (except for a decrease in M-VLDL-CE and an increase in lactate).  3.3. Cross-Sectional Association between Mediterranean Diet Adherence and Biomarkers We also examined the cross-sectional linear association between biomarkers and adherence to the MedDiet at point 1 and 2 of this study, regardless of the participant’s group at baseline and follow up. Results were similar at both time points, although somewhat higher effect sizes where observed at time 2 where all participants had received at least 6 months of the MedDiet intervention (Figure 3).",61016e43-0f4b-4e14-a88f-3a1a8fe2a170
11,methods11," A 1 unit difference in mMDS score was associated with lower total lipids in lipoproteins of different sizes (VLDL, LDL) and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, lower concentrations of a marker of inflammation (Glyc A), lower concentrations of branched chain amino acids and higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and Docosahexaenoic acid (Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) (Figure 3). We further included all the participants grouped together and analyzed the association between unit changes in the MedDiet score and SD changes in metabolic markers. We found a similar pattern in the results, but not significant, with a tendency to higher lipoprotein particle size with higher MedDiet scores (Figure S2).  Similar results were found when we used the Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score instead of the mMDS (Figure S3).  4.",95c8ad55-7cd0-40a3-8eab-6e42dd3b71a1
12,methods12," Discussion In this sub-study of firefighters in Indianapolis participating in a cluster-randomized MedDiet intervention trial, we found that the MedDiet intervention was associated with favorable changes in markers of cardiovascular risk, specifically those related to the lipid metabolism (cholesterol, lipid composition, or cholesterol esters in the VLDL, IDL, and LDL lipoprotein subclasses, and ApoB/ApoA ratio) that were non-significant after correcting for multiple testing (except for a decrease in M-VLDL-CE). When the adherence to the MedDiet was measured with a self-reported scale (mMDS), the direction of the association with metabolites was similar at both time points (baseline and 6 months after the follow up).  Our results highlighting the changes in plasma metabolites related to lipid metabolism are in line with other studies [20,26].",90dd2e2a-b006-4804-bbc8-c36d6461e2aa
13,methods13," A recent investigation that identified a metabolic signature of adherence to the MedDiet showed that out of 67 metabolites, 45 were lipids followed by 19 amino acids, 2 vitamins and 1 xenobiotic [26]. Although we used a different methodology and a different set of biomarkers, and thus we could not replicate this metabolic signature, our results support that the MedDiet may induce changes in relevant lipid species and subclasses related to atherogenic risk. In fact, the MedDiet is high in healthy fats (>35–40% of the total energy) mostly from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (olive oil mostly) and PUFAs (from nuts and fish), and therefore the results are not surprising. In the firefighter population, we previously reported good correlation between nutrient intake from the food frequency questionnaire and the corresponding plasma biomarkers (omega-3, Eicosapentaenoic acid (Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)), and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) [36].",0c2f4377-04a0-47fc-ac2c-981d2aa85735
14,methods14," In line with these results, we found that changes in the MedDiet scores showed some tendency to be associated with fatty acids (an increase in PUFA% specifically Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)% in the expense of MUFA%). Although olive oil is a main component of the MedDiet, previous research found that higher consumption of this oil was linked to changes in omega 3, but not MUFA concentrations [36,41,42]. In addition, the average olive oil consumption in the firefighters is only approximately 0.5 tbsp/day, which is similar to other US cohorts [43] but much lower than in a Spanish cohort (4 tbsp/day) [44]. Nonetheless, it looks like changes in omega 3 to fatty acid ratio, PUFA to FA ratio and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to FA ratio increase with changes in the adherence to the MedDiet. This is in line with other studies [20,36], and suggests that those biomarkers could serve as indicators of adherence to the MedDiet.",64bfb611-5bc3-4b5d-abff-0eed3f3323ed
15,methods15,"  We found that the MedDiet intervention induced a decrease in total cholesterol, remnant-C, VLDL-C and LDL-C and an increase in HDL-C and HDL2-C. Many studies have already demonstrated the effect of the MedDiet on total lipid metabolism, especially reducing total cholesterol and increasing HDL-C [45]. For example, the Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) study, a randomized control trial, found that those in the MedDiet intervention (with olive oil or nuts) over 6 months had an increase in HDL-C but not a reduction in LDL-C [45]. Other studies support that replacing dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with PUFA reduces the plasma LDL-C and subsequently the risk of cardiovascular disease [46,47,48].  In our study, we also observed a decrease in large, medium and small LDL fractions such as total lipids, cholesterol, particle concentration or cholesterol esters.",14a5e9b2-7727-4fc5-bd45-e8076311f6e7
16,methods16," Similarly, the MedDiet intervention decreased total cholesterol and cholesterol esters in the large, medium and small VLDL. Literature shows that VLDL concentrations are related directly or indirectly in the development of atherosclerosis [49]; for example the fatty acid composition of VLDL is critical for the activity of lipoprotein lipase and the formation of proatherogenic LDL and VLDL remnants [50]. In the FINRISK cohort, increased risk of cardiovascular disease was associated with all VLDL, IDL, and LDL subclasses, while the L- and M-HDL subclasses were associated with lower risk [51]. Despite the evidence of the role of these metabolites in cardiovascular disease (CVD) development, few studies have studied the effect of a MedDiet intervention in different lipids composition of lipoproteins or its subfractions.",4181e4d8-e64e-4313-9fbb-9e6c0d7d62ed
17,methods17," Interestingly, our results on lipid subfractions agree with a recent publication using the same metabolomic approach, where 47 participants were randomized to a SFA-rich diet, a MUFA-rich diet or a MED diet for 8 weeks. Additionally, in another study, compared to the control group, those participants that replaced SFAs with PUFAs reduced the lipoprotein particle concentration [52]. Finally, olive oil consumption modifies the lipid composition of VLDL [53] as well as the lipoprotein subfractions [54].  In our study, the effect was consistently shown in both groups, usually being stronger in the group undergoing a longer MedDiet intervention/exposure (MedDiet intervention + a self-sustained continuation phase), suggesting that the MedDiet induces favorable changes in metabolites related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) disease while the adherence to the MedDiet is sustained.",a826a62c-d8ce-4b64-a412-09c88a4c0385
18,methods18," For example, in our study, the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was decreased in both groups after the intervention and also by adherence to the mMDS, which agrees with other short-term randomized trial with the MedDiet supplemented with olive oil, suggesting that these ratios may predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) beyond conventional lipid measures [55]. Finally, we found a significant association with lactate, a metabolite that was previously shown to increase the diabetes risk in the Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) study [56]. However, we found that it occurs in the opposite direction.  Study Limitations This was a pilot study with a small sample size. Possibly because of this, most associations lost statistical significance after correcting for multiple testing. However, results were in line with previous research, suggesting that a larger sample size would have retrieved significant results.",3ea1506b-2231-4d1e-b4ca-8e4f891a9533
19,methods19," In addition, the fact that we did not find differences in the mMDS adherence between groups may reflect selection bias since this is a sub-study within 400 firefighters participating in the Feeding America’s Bravest trial, and participants willing to participate could potentially be healthier and more health conscious. Moreover, the control group had higher scores of mMDS at baseline and their scores were slightly improved during the intervention; however, the results were consistent in the cross-sectional analysis. We only adjusted for age and sex, since it was a randomized study with no significant differences between this sub-study and the parent study for the rest of the variables which suggests the need to perform a study that includes larger metabolites. In addition, we did not analyze other metabolites included in other studies nor at baseline for the parent study.",e1e985d3-f01a-4e88-9866-5dc2c6e9130b
20,methods20," In this pilot trial, Group 2 could be considered as the intervention group but Group 1 was not a pure control group because they already finished an active MedDiet intervention and began their self-sustained MedDiet phase. The changes in biomarkers in Group 1 (between time point 1 and 2) are more likely to reflect both residual effects of the MedDiet and continued effects from self-sustained diet intervention. Additionally, most of our participants were male and thus generalizability should be explored. In any case, the results in this study should be corroborated in larger clinical studies with longer follow up due to the pilot study nature and with a powerful study design.  5. Conclusions This MedDiet intervention induces only modest changes in adherence to the MedDiet and consequently in metabolic biomarkers related to lipid metabolism. Further research should confirm these results based on larger study samples in workplace interventions with powerful study designs. ",ba83bec0-fb39-4965-b5b5-ff475496f520
