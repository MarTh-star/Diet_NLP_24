0,introduction0,"Menopause is a critical period in a woman’s life, during which body weight gain and redistribution of adipose tissue towards a more central/android phenotype has been observed1. There is increasing evidence that visceral obesity is linked to metabolic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes1,2. Successful strategies for reducing overweight and improving metabolism in postmenopausal women are therefore of the utmost importance3.  One dietary model for reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events, which is recommended by the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)4 and the American Heart Association (AHA)5, is a low-calorie, low-fat diet. Another dietary model, the so-called Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean diet (MED)) is characterized by a relatively high fat intake (up to 40% of total daily calories), of which monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) give 15–25% of the energy6,7.",dd2c0b68-6a8d-44fe-b766-e64f261cd052
1,introduction1," The benefits of the Mediterranean diet (MED) for body weight loss and for reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events have been pointed out in many studies, where both energy-restricted and ad libitum approaches have been applied8–12. However, Papadaki & Scott have stated that adoption of the Mediterranean diet (MED) by other than Southern Europe populations is difficult, on account of its high cost and the limited availability of these unfamiliar food items, as well as cultural differences that affect food choice13. At the same time, interest has increased in diets based on local healthy food items in the prevention or treatment of nutritionally dependent diseases. Eating a traditional balanced Nordic diet has been associated with lower death rates in a Danish cohort study14.",fc5a05b9-957b-4530-a4f8-b2fdf4778dd6
2,introduction2," Similarly to the Nordic region, in the central part of Europe (such as Poland), there are several common food items—including fish (herring), whole grain rye (eaten as rye bread), oats (eaten as oatmeal), barley (eaten as a cereal grain), root vegetables (beetroot), cabbages, berries, apples, and plums—which have much better nutrient profiles than the typical Western diet. The aim of this study was thus to compare the effectiveness of two energy-restricted diets differing in macronutrients on weight loss and improvement in selected risk factors for metabolic syndrome (MetS). The diets used were the Mediterranean diet (MED), which is moderate in fat and has a high proportion of MUFAs, and the so-called Central European diet (Central European diet (CED)), which is low in fat, moderate in carbohydrates, and high in dietary fiber (DF) derived from central European food items.",d51d035d-04bc-46bc-99b4-cdab4f3e9074

Measure of adherence Dietary adherence was calculated at each time of the four postrandomization points using a Mahalanobis distance equation. This equation was used to measure the difference between the reported and the recommended distribution of energy intake from carbohydrate, fat, MUFAs, and protein. A lower score reflects better adherence and a higher score reflects poorer adherence to the prescribed diets. Details of adherence measuring have been published elsewhere16.

33,discussion0,"In our study, postmenopausal women with central obesity and with at least one another MetS criterion were randomly assigned to one of two types of energy-restricted diets—to the Central European diet (CED) or to the Mediterranean diet (MED), which had different contents of carbohydrates, DF, total fat, and MUFAs. We found that the postmenopausal women lost on average 7.6 kg weight (95% CI; −8.2, −7.0), 7.4 cm WC (−8.1, −6.8), 6.6 kg FM (−7.1, −6.1), and 0.26 kg VF (−0.28, −0.23), with no differences between diets. The reductions in BW were accompanied by beneficial changes in the concentrations of some blood metabolic biomarkers, such as GLU, insulin (INS), HOMA2-IR, T-C, TG, and blood pressure. Neither the Central European diet (CED) nor the Mediterranean diet (MED) significantly improved LDL-C, HDL-C, or Hcy concentrations. In general, it could be concluded that both reduced-calorie diets were equally efficient regardless of their macronutrient compositions.",dc22d062-c2e1-4e6f-8766-0bbe30482623
34,discussion1," The findings of our study are consistent with existing data showing that energy restriction diets with different macronutrient compositions can lead to weight loss and reduction of MetS risk25–28. For example, an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet (MED)29 or the low fat, hypocaloric diet used in the Look Ahead Trial26 both have a beneficial effects on weight loss and improvement of MetS risk factors. However, none of these studies determined whether the metabolic effect could be attributed to the weight loss or to the diets themselves.  The weight loss observed in our study, although satisfying, was less than we had expected, taking into account the targeted energy deficit (2.93 MJ). It seems that individual adherence to dietary goals could be the primary determinant of the diet efficacy. Regarding this, Gibson & Sainsbury indicated that the level of adherence may be influenced by how different a dietary intervention is from a person’s usual diet30.",9b84cc43-5004-4027-bd2c-bc146507db9c
35,discussion2," We therefore assumed that the Central European diet (CED) may be a more feasible diet option than the Mediterranean diet (MED) in Central Europe. However, we observed that the adherence score declined similarly over time in both groups. Feelings of hunger are often cited as the reason for poor adherence to energy-restricted weight loss regimes31. In our study, subjective sensations of hunger were similarly elevated in both groups over the course of the trial. It was found that substantially diminished adherence after the first few months is typical in weight-loss trials, and this suggests that participants in weight-loss programs revert to their customary macronutrient intakes over time25. Indeed, less adherent postmenopausal women from the Central European diet (CED) and Mediterranean diet (MED) groups tended to eat respectively more fat and more carbohydrate.",84a4f741-362a-4a95-8e39-07fdc09d93eb
36,discussion3," Comparisons between more and less adherent postmenopausal women were also made in relation to changes in several anthropometric and metabolic parameters. Within each diet group, the more adherent participants from the Central European diet (CED) and Mediterranean diet (MED) groups lost significantly more weight by respectively 3.1 kg (34.4%) and 2.8 kg (29.7%) than the less adherent counterparts. A greater reduction in body weight observed in the more adherent participants from both study groups was associated with a greater reduction in WC and fat free mass (FFM).  However, in the Central European diet (CED) group only, the more adherent participants lost significantly more VF (by 23.3%) than their less adherent counterparts. In the Mediterranean diet (MED) group, the nonsignificant difference in VF reductions between the more and the less adherent participants was only 14.8%.",ad090494-3ec3-4185-a302-b2a706a3b69d
37,discussion4," Because VF is closely related to the metabolic consequences of obesity32, the effect of dieting on the reduction of this type of fat is the most desirable. Only few trials have directly measured changes in VF in response to weight-reducing diets. There is thus still a debate on which, if any, diet most effective for VF loss33. We found that in the Central European diet (CED) group, the reduction in VF was associated with increases in the proportion of carbohydrate and DF intake, and with decreases in the total and SFAs intake. Our findings are consistent with the results of previous studies showing that overeating SFAs promotes VF storage34. In the case of DF, it was reported that increases in DF intake over a two-year period were associated with less VF accumulation in overweight Latino youth35.",05ac5cc2-33ad-4250-a649-c6ce7887fabd
38,discussion5," The mechanism for how this dietary compound might affect visceral adiposity is unknown; however, it was found that DF increased fecal bulk, decreased transit time, and increased insulin sensitivity35. In our study, the postmenopausal women who were more adherent to the Central European diet (CED) had higher (by ~5 g/4.2 MJ) intake of DF than their less adherent counterparts. Anderson & Gustafson indicated that high dietary fiber intake may independently enhance adherence to the prescribed diet, perhaps by increasing satiety or because of the simplicity of the concept36. Indeed, we also observed that higher intake of dietary fiber was associated with higher adherence level in the Central European diet (CED) group (r = −0.44, P < 0.001; data not shown in the results section), but not in the Mediterranean diet (MED) (r = 0.10, P = 0.887; data not shown in the results section).",ec2af022-7cd9-4828-81b5-a4bb7a4471e7
39,discussion6," The DF in the Central European diet (CED) was mostly in soluble form and was derived mainly from oats, barley, apples, plums, beetroot, and flaxseeds. The proportion of soluble to insoluble DF in this type of diet was 35% to 65%, while in the Mediterranean diet (MED) this was only 20 to 80%. Schneeman reported that 30–50% soluble and 50–70% insoluble DF are considered to be well-balanced proportions for optimum health benefits37. Moreover, a portion of oats or barley with seasonal fruits and ground flaxseeds consumed by the postmenopausal women in the Central European diet (CED) group at breakfast provided ~5 g β-glucan—an important food component in the modulation of metabolic dysregulations associated with metabolic syndrome38.  Surprisingly, in the Mediterranean diet (MED) study group, the reduction in VF was only due to the energy deficit. In their review, Bendall et al.",8c051779-0468-4b38-9678-9d4eae385dd7
40,discussion7," considered to whether the reductions in central obesity reported in several studies resulted from the Mediterranean diet (MED) per se, or simply from the energy restriction accompanying this dietary regimen39. They concluded that the observed greater reduction in central obesity could be explained by the higher postprandial fat oxidation rate and the higher thermic effect following meals high in MUFAs40. In our study, Mediterranean diet (MED) significantly affected postabsorptive npRQ levels, tending them towards lower values. These results seem to reflect the dietary composition of the Mediterranean diet (MED). Furthermore, it appears that oleic acid (the predominant MUFAs in olive oil) is more favorably oxidized, while saturated fats are more favorably stored30. Indeed, in our study also, significant correlations were seen between VF deposits and the percentage of total fat and SFAs at the beginning of the trial.  This study has several strengths.",0edc9356-ebdf-4689-a4ca-127af4b3e719
41,discussion8," First, the study was conducted in an established, short-term, and successful randomized trial. Second, the groups were homogenous, postmenopausal women who, apart from central obesity, had at least one feature of MetS. There was a strong support from dieticians throughout the intervention period, and the participants received not only detailed dietary plans, but also ready-to-eat main meals. There are also some limitations to the finding reported here. First, even if the sample size (72 postmenopausal women in each dietary arm) was large enough to detect differences in body weight between the two tested diets over 16 weeks of dietary intervention, 36 participants in each more and less adherent subgroup may be inadequate to detect significant differences in some metabolic syndrome risk factors. Second, the duration of our trial was only 16 weeks, which might have been too short to detect the minor effects of the diets.",be47e802-7083-4826-a4b2-4847c223d294
42,discussion9," However, given that there were significantly lower body weight losses at week 12 of the trial in the less adherent women in the Central European diet (CED) group, it seems that a longer trial might have been ineffective. Third, deviation from macronutrient goals as a measure of adherence was heavily dependent on self‐reported dietary recall. In future studies, other more sensitive biochemical indicators (such as erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition) should be used to monitor adherence. Fourthly, the adherence levels observed in this study are likely even higher than in the general population, which may in part be explained by the fact that main meals were provided every day to the participants for free. In future, the effectiveness of both diets should be tested in real world settings.",b70124d1-b71d-4dc1-a6a6-c3891cd0781d
43,discussion10,"  Conclusion The short-term dietary treatment using the Central European diet (CED) or the Mediterranean diet (MED) was associated with similar improvements in some anthropometric, lipid, and nonlipid parameters; however, adequate adherence to the prescribed diet is important in weight loss success and in achieving improvements in metabolic health. Apart from adherence, substantial differences in the proportions of dietary macronutrients also play an important role in visceral fat loss success, and this success is possible when adequate DF is provided.
