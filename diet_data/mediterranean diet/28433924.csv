0,introduction0,"Even though numerous studies have linked a high-quality dietary pattern with lower incidence of chronic diseases [1], particularly cardiovascular disease [2,3], the effect of high-quality dietary patterns on health-related quality of life (health related quality of life (HRQL)) is still not well known [4–7]. Self-perceived HRLQ is a relevant variable because it could be a predictor of chronic disease and mortality in the long term [8–9] and it is likely to be influenced by an overall high-quality dietary pattern.  During the last 2 decades, the use of patient-reported outcome measures represents a strong shift in medicine, because previously the main reliance was on clinical measurements and biomarkers instead of self-reported information. In this context, self-reported quality of life is considered as the extent to which the life of a person is felt as comfortable or satisfying.",a50d0f86-0393-4efa-a8ef-6b0e6380db1c
1,introduction1," Quality of life has more to do with happiness, convenience, well-being and easiness in life than with wealth, power or hierarchical/professional roles. According to the US government goals “Healthy People 2020”, health-related quality of life (health related quality of life (HRQL)) is a “multi-dimensional concept that includes domains related to physical, mental, emotional, and social functioning. It goes beyond direct measures of population health, life expectancy, and causes of death, and focuses on the impact health status has on quality of life” (www.healthypeople.gov). The most frequently used tool to appraise health related quality of life (HRQL) is the short-form 36 questionnaire.  health related quality of life (HRQL) can be partly determined by dietary patterns.",87ae5096-d816-4f39-9407-41d22d59a603
2,introduction2," Studying dietary patterns instead of individual foods or nutrients is the state-of-the-art in current nutritional epidemiology, because complete dietary patterns provide a more realistically picture of food consumption habits while capturing the synergistic or antagonistic effects that foods and nutrients may have when they are consumed together [10]. In the context of overall dietary patterns, the traditional Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been found to be associated with better health related quality of life (HRQL) in the Moli-sani Project, a population-based cohort study in Italy [11]. Smaller cross-sectional studies conducted in Spain [12–13] have also shown positive associations between adherence to the MedDiet and health related quality of life (HRQL).",574b24e2-93db-47ea-8209-21097350c57f
3,introduction3," In the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Project [14], a Spanish multipurpose prospective cohort study including more than 11,000 middle-aged university graduates, a significant direct association between higher baseline adherence to the MedDiet and better physical and mental health dimensions of health related quality of life (HRQL) was reported after a 4-year follow-up.  In general, studies have found better health related quality of life (HRQL) associated with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, but the dimensions of health categories differ among studies. In some studies, the beneficial association was observed for the physical dimensions [7,14], whereas in others improvements were observed only for mental dimensions [11,13,15]. The ascertainment of the reasons for these differences and the mechanisms involved is still a matter of investigation.",7d85aabd-4dfc-4c59-9116-920dee32f7ff
4,introduction4,"  health related quality of life (HRQL) is becoming more important with the steady increase in life expectancy and could inform general practitioners and policy makers for decision-making. Collecting sound evidence on the link between high adherence to an MedDiet and health related quality of life (HRQL) among older individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease is especially appealing from a public health perspective. In this context, the primary aim of our study was to assess whether baseline adherence to a MedDiet was cross-sectionally associated with better baseline health related quality of life (HRQL) in the participants of the PREDIMED-Plus randomized trial.

12,methods7," It allows studying different dimensions that can be grouped in an aggregated physical dimension and an aggregated mental dimension. Specifically, the 36 items measure eight multi-item dimensions: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems (role-physical), bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems (role emotional) and mental health. The first four domains deal with physical aspects, and the next four reflect psychological features. For each parameter, scores are coded, summed and transformed to a scale from 0 (the worst possible condition) to 100 (the best possible condition). This questionnaire is a useful tool to compare health status that varies according to different healthy lifestyles and diseases [17]. The HQRL was completed during the baseline visit.

21,discussion0,"We found a direct association between baseline adherence to an MedDiet and all dimensions of health-related quality of life. Beyond merely statistically significant differences, clinically meaningful associations were also observed, because we found differences greater than three points in three of them, belonging to mental health dimensions [20–23]. Our results are consistent with previous findings. [7,11–13]  On the other hand, Henriquez-Sanchez et al [14] observed a positive relationship between adherence to the MedDiet and four physical health categories of health related quality of life (HRQL) in highly educated and younger subjects in their longitudinal assessment of the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort, although there were no significant associations with most of the mental health dimensions.",ced8292d-2c6c-4281-9fa5-d83e81dcb0db
22,discussion1," While the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) study and the present one have been conducted in Spain and consider a full dietary pattern, participants in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort were younger and healthier than those in the PREDIMED-Plus trial, who were aged between 55 and 75 years, had overweight or obesity, and all met criteria for metabolic syndrome. An average worse score in physical dimensions could also be attributable to a relatively higher prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes and tobacco consumption [24]. Furthermore, Perez-Tasigchana et al [7] found slightly better results in physical categories when a high adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern [25] was reported in the ENRICA cohort, but they had a smaller sample, used a shorter version of the questionnaire and the differences were small and probably not clinically relevant.",64cec34d-c905-4603-98b9-8ac98f32645a
23,discussion2,"  Although current evidence suggests a positive association between adherence to the MedDiet and self-reported health related quality of life (HRQL), the mechanisms involved are still unclear. Life domains such as social interactions, personal satisfaction or economical characteristics could have a reciprocal relationship with food habits and the way we eat and, together with the physical and psychological health, could define what we consider to be a good or poor quality of life. On the other hand, there is evidence suggesting that conformity to the MedDiet reduces the risk of chronic diseases [26] and is protective against cardiovascular diseases [2,3,27–31]. The MedDiet has also been linked to a lower risk of depression [15,32] and better cognitive function [33–35]. There is also an inverse relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and perceived stress and depressive symptoms [36].",86dfaabb-72ce-40bc-9476-4cbb83843f08
24,discussion3," Therefore, it seems coherent that in overweight/obese subjects, as those in the PREDIMED-Plus trial, a better adherence to the MedDiet might be associated with better scores in the mental dimensions of health related quality of life (HRQL).  Despite the large sample size, adjustment for a wide array of potential confounders, and inclusion of participants from various regions of Spain with different dietary habits, our study has limitations. First, the cross-sectional design does not allow to establish an appropriate temporal sequence and cannot demonstrate causality, because reverse causation cannot be ruled out. The association that we report here might be bi-directional.",b04c8a0e-739c-4bf2-b126-d56af3ad29a6
25,discussion4," Second, our results stemmed from participants with overweight or obesity who had been just recruited for a trial aiming to assess the effects of an MedDiet together with promotion of physical activity and a behavioral intervention compared to a nutritional intervention aiming to increase adherence to an ad libitum traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern. Thus, the personal satisfaction of participants immediately after being enrolled into the trial might have also affected the results. Nevertheless, information on both diet and health related quality of life (HRQL) was collected at baseline, in the initial visit, before participants had been exposed to the intervention and we did not compare the intervention versus the control group in this assessment. Third, although we adjusted for many potential confounders, residual confounding might have affected the results. Fourth, information on diet was self-reported.",38227659-eaf4-4a82-ac5d-7d8679c4d83f
26,discussion5," Nevertheless, it was collected in a face-to-face interview with trained dietitians, which increases the accuracy of the information. In any case, the resulting misclassification would have biased our results towards the null. Finally, we had no information on socioeconomic status which is also related to health and self-reported health [22]. However, we adjusted for educational level, which is a proxy of socioeconomic status and is also in itself a determinant of adherence to a healthy diet and of health related quality of life (HRQL) [37].  Conclusions Our results suggest a positive association between higher adherence to a MedDiet and better quality of life and each of its dimensions.",00636c44-b48b-42dd-a097-1d2e2e9f2793
27,discussion6," Since there are some differences in the results compared to previous reports, we believe that further studies, preferentially with a longitudinal design, are needed in order to better ascertain the direction of causality and to identify which dimensions of health related quality of life (HRQL) are more susceptible of improvement by following a MedDiet.
