The lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 study started in February 2014 [37] and was planned as the pilot study of the subsequently performed larger lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-2 study, which started in 2015 [38]. The lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-2 study is currently still recruiting (n = 484, as of May 2021).",91713866-4b7f-4a7e-ae7e-d043821ced6f

[37, 39]. In the present secondary analysis of the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 cohort, we analyzed of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) serum levels from all participants of the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 study (total n = 68) of whom both blood samples and all clinical data, including questionnaires, anthropometry, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)), and measures on fatty acid profiles in red blood cell membranes (red blood cell membranes (RBCM)),",2a36db7a-180d-4af3-890b-103f832137b9

We focused on the 3-month period of the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 intervention as more pronounced lifestyle-associated effects on the biomarkers were expected during the intensive phase of the program [40]. Also, because of the small sample size and limited detection capacities of our quantitative tests, smaller changes in of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) serum levels might be more difficult to detect. Both gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers with a history of BC or OC prior to SE (diseased participants) and non-diseased participants, without previous BC or OC, were included in the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 study. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants.",79ae5025-c6e6-44a9-a915-95e10836bb6a

Over 3 months, the IG received two supervised and one home-based physical training session per week with the objective of increasing physical activity to at least 18 metabolic equivalents of task/-hour, mainly through endurance-based exercise to improve cardiopulmonary fitness. Nutrition education followed a group-based approach on fortnightly basis. The CG attended only one information session at SE on the benefits of physical activity and nutritional recommendations in accordance with the German Nutrition Society [37].",85fb0adc-20f1-4ff6-b2e0-e114beaa754c

To gain objective data on the effects of the intervention program on cardiopulmonary fitness, the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 peak in ml/min/kg) as a validated surrogate parameter for endurance performance [41] was measured using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) describes a ramp protocol, which measures respiratory gases under gradually increasing resistance to achieve physical exhaustion [42].

7,methods7," The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) [43] was used to score the nutritional adherence to the MedD with 14 items on food consumption and MedD habits. To reduce the bias of unanswered questions, the score was calculated as a percentage of positively answered questions (1 = stronger adherence to MedD, 0 = less adherence to MedD) to all answered questions [44]. Participants fasted a minimum of 12 h prior to each study visit. Blood samples were processed to aliquots and either analyzed within 48 h or stored at − 80 °C until usage.

In total we used 6 kits for sRANK ligand (RANKL) and 4 kits for of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG). For quality control, we assessed the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) for each kit, being between 5.6 and 6.5% (inter-assay CV), as well as between 3.5 and 12.6% (intra-assay CV), which is generally accepted as good [45]. All standards and controls were within the default range, as stated by the manufacturer, with the exception that in one sRANK ligand (RANKL) enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) run the low control was 6% above the reference range.

For sRANK ligand (RANKL), we excluded data from 13 participants due to technical measurement errors, as serum levels were below the detection rate of the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. For of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG), we excluded data from 2 participants due to a technical measurement error (no concentrations were provided by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits). We thus had data available from 20 participants in the IG and 27 participants in the CG for of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) as well as from 17 participants in the IG and 19 participants in the CG for sRANK ligand (RANKL) (Fig. 1).

To test whether two independent groups were statistically different, we used the Mann–Whitney U test. For categorical variables, we used the Fisher’s exact test. To test for differences within each study group before and after the 3-month intervention phase (ΔV1-SE), we used the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. Associations between two variables were tested using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (r); associations between more than two variables were tested using multiple linear regressions.

We conducted statistical outlier analyses using the Tukey method for Boxplots [48], identifying 8 data sets that could be regarded as outliers. However, we decided not to exclude these data for several reasons: firstly, no clinical reference values are yet available for the biomarkers in the context of hereditary BC, not allowing assumptions with regard to clinical implausibility. Secondly, we did not find an indication for measurement errors; hence, by including all measurable concentrations, we aimed at preventing arbitrariness. Thirdly, the comparison of data sets when excluding outliers achieved similar results. ",047e0134-c6fc-4b42-bd7b-e5afab3fb24f

In the present analysis, we explored the potential effects of a structured lifestyle intervention on of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) serum concentrations and demonstrated that the MedD in combination with increased physical activity may be biomarker modulators.",543d46e9-ff45-43c3-97af-7f880483349f
26,discussion1," To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that lifestyle intervention-based alterations in of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) serum concentrations were shown in the context of gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers.  Several studies propose that of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) can be increased directly through physical activity by the mechanism of mechanical bone stress [40, 50, 51]. While Ziegler et al. showed that of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) concentrations increased immediately after an endurance exercise [27], Bergström et al. found significantly elevated of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels after a structured 1-year endurance training [28].",a7ee1266-f20a-4198-9e66-72a9368f6b29
27,discussion2," Hence, the RANK/RANK ligand (RANKL)/of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) pathway seems to be responsive to acute as well as chronic exercise [52]. Our data support these findings by showing a significant increase in of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) serum concentrations over a time span of 3 months, indicating a direct responsiveness of the biomarker to changes in health behavior related to physical activity.  In contrast to of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG), the influence of physical activity on sRANK ligand (RANKL) concentrations is still unclear [28]. Some studies show that exercise can lower sRANK ligand (RANKL) serum concentrations, but changes are likely to depend on the intensity of exercise [53, 54]. Ziegler et al.",cf639cfa-b2d9-4c73-967e-011a525ab7a7
28,discussion3," demonstrated that sRANK ligand (RANKL) decreased significantly only when running a marathon, but not a 15 km distance [27]. Scott et al. reported that while endurance training instantly increased of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG), only high-intensity endurance exercise caused an additional decrease in sRANK ligand (RANKL) [55]. Our results support these findings, where we showed diminishing sRANK ligand (RANKL) concentrations within both study groups, but only significantly in the IG (Fig. 2B). This might indicate that only a structured and supervised intervention program like in the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 IG provides the intensity needed to effectively change sRANK ligand (RANKL) concentrations.",2d366625-34e4-436d-9c3a-a660a26dca5e
29,discussion4," However, since the intergroup difference in sRANK ligand (RANKL) changes was not significant, the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 lifestyle intervention might not be sufficient to significantly lower sRANK ligand (RANKL) levels. While VO2peak increased in the IG and decreased in the CG (Fig. 3A), indeed indicating a measurable improvement in cardiopulmonary fitness through the lifestyle intervention, there is a need for further studies with a more intense exercise design with either more frequent training sessions or higher intensities. After all, it remains unclear whether the diminishing effect of exercise on sRANK ligand (RANKL) is a direct mechanism or whether it is a result of an increase of inhibitory of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels [27].",2bb77592-3bc2-4fc1-9d1f-d130135f5789
30,discussion5,"  Apart from exercise, of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) seem to be responsive to dietary habits. Various nutritional studies show a modulating impact of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on these biomarkers [56]. In the present analysis we showed a significant association between the intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), specifically EPA, and of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) (Fig. 4).",929b2a38-0187-4ca7-ab46-acd4e5b8cc52
31,discussion6," Our results indicate that a structured nutritional intervention might change polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake patterns sufficiently, as only the IG showed a significant association to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in subgroup comparison to the CG (albeit the non-corrected p value), which supports other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) analyses on the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 cohort [44]. Our results are supported by several studies, such as Martin-Bautista et al. who reported an increase in of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) by 18% and decrease in sRANK ligand (RANKL) by 7% after a 1-year consumption of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [57].",2993913c-8be1-498d-ae52-34fb539c3f17
32,discussion7," The latter negative correlation between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) was also described by several other studies [58, 59]; however, our data were not able to replicate these results. This might be due to the rather large variances in our sRANK ligand (RANKL) data and might be aggravated by our small sample size. For n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which are consumed less when following the MedD, a negative association to of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) as well as a positive association to sRANK ligand (RANKL) is described [60]. By diminishing the of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG)/sRANK ligand (RANKL) expression, the intake of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) has been associated with an increased inflammatory and osteoclastic activity and hence risk of cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis [61].",c0c7d7af-55a7-40d6-9139-8bdd4f34d7da
33,discussion8," While being non-significant after adjusting for multiple testing, our correlations show congruent results for n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as well as for the n-9 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) oleic acid, for which olive oil is a primary dietary source and is known to inhibit osteoclastogenesis. In summary, our correlation analyses seem to confirm the associations between the different polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) that are described by various studies using prospective data of gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers and suggest that the MedD might modulate the biomarker serum levels through modification of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake.",3a6f9a7e-a4ba-4c9c-9429-8af9bf8e1b91
34,discussion9,"  Furthermore, sRANK ligand (RANKL) is reported to depend on the metabolic status and to diminish as a response to a reduction of adipose tissue and thus circulating sex hormones, insulin, proinflammatory cytokines, and the adipocytokine leptin [62, 63]. It has been shown that the MedD can improve the metabolic status [64, 65]; hence the nutritional intervention, measured as a significant increase in the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score (Fig. 3B), might also explain the observed decrease in sRANK ligand (RANKL) concentrations in the IG. Pasanisi et al. showed in a similar study on gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers that a dietary MedD intervention can lead to a reduction of sRANK ligand (RANKL) through reduced levels of proinflammatory IGF-1 [32].  We performed exploratory multiple linear regression models to examine whether participant characteristics at SE might influence biomarker changes during the study.",3c325f64-68d3-48d0-adb2-eefac3fb7718
35,discussion10," To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the dynamics of changes in of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) are assessed with regards to their initial serum levels. For sRANK ligand (RANKL), we identified the baseline level as a significant influence on the change of the serum levels, but not for of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG), suggesting baseline sRANK ligand (RANKL) levels as a potential candidate to predict the outcome of a 3-month lifestyle intervention. For gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers with initially high sRANK ligand (RANKL) concentrations, the biomarker seems to decrease stronger over the intervention phase compared to women with lower initial sRANK ligand (RANKL) serum levels.",9ff713cd-fbb0-41de-b4c1-4dbb795a9b3c
36,discussion11," The fact that sRANK ligand (RANKL) is associated with a proinflammatory metabolic status [66], indicates that especially participants with a less active lifestyle might benefit from such an intervention program. In turn, there might be a saturation effect for participants with an already healthy lifestyle and initially low sRANK ligand (RANKL) levels, leading to a smaller decrease in the biomarker through an additional change in health habits. Hence, initial biomarker levels might also affect the modulative potential of lifestyle changes. Multivariate regression models also showed that cigarette smoking might influence the change of sRANK ligand (RANKL) in the course of the study. It has been shown that smoking can induce the expression of RANK ligand (RANKL) mRNA [67] and increases the sRANK ligand (RANKL)/of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio by promoting inflammatory cytokines [68].",78daa4ad-3b6a-4e0d-a8ab-f4f337521fef
37,discussion12," In a large case–control study it was demonstrated that cigarette smoking increased the risk for BC in gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers [69] for which sRANK ligand (RANKL)/of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) system might present a molecular mechanism of action. According to our data, baseline physical fitness (assessed as VO2peak in cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)) was associated with changes in of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG). The higher the participants’ initial VO2peak, as a proxy for cardiopulmonary fitness, the more pronounced of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels increased during the study.",778c71a9-6cab-443c-9481-fa7a90e5af98
38,discussion13," This finding supports the notion that of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) is primarily responsive to physical activity [27] and might indicate a dose–response relationship between cardiopulmonary fitness and of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) serum concentrations. In all, while our results must be regarded as purely explorative, we aim to confirm these findings using prospective data from the larger lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-2 study.  While biomarker changes were more pronounced in the IG, we did not find significant intergroup differences in biomarker changes in any of our analyses. This suggests that all participants, independent of the study group allocation, seem to have made efforts within the study program to adapt to healthier lifestyle choices.",4b306138-692a-4796-bfba-b1e3b8b9ba39
39,discussion14," We assume that information exchange between participants due to the open design of the study, as well as possible disappointment within the CG with regards to group allocation, which would be consistent with previous findings from the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 study [38], might explain why some effects that were expected only in the IG also occurred in the CG.  Furthermore, our study cohort was likely to inherit a selection bias toward participants prone to above-average health habits, as it has been shown that a prior cancer disease is likely to have confounding effects on subsequent health behavior [70]. Especially the fact that a gBRCA1/2 mutation or cancer diagnosis often occurs within the familial surrounding, participants—whether themselves diseased or not—are likely to be sensitized for a more proactive engagement toward lifestyle changes [71].",88ac3a80-2254-4c1e-a824-962d21afb1f0
40,discussion15," We also did not control for special dietary habits or sport programs of the participants prior to SE, hence we could not account for potentially confounding and/or prolonging effects of individual health behavior on the biomarkers.  The small sample size of this evaluation represents its main limitation. However, this explorative approach aimed at generating novel knowledge regarding a possible association between lifestyle, the biomarkers of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL), and BC in at-risk individuals. The present analysis was conducted as a secondary analysis and was no initial endpoint of the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 study; therefore, study design and sample size were not established based on statistical measures.",5bbbfa26-aa6d-47c4-9c64-f82724adc08b
41,discussion16," Hence, we cannot ensure representativeness of our cohort (n = 49) compared to the full lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 cohort (n = 68) or compared to the combined lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1 and lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-2 cohort after both trials will be finished (planned n = 660). These initial findings can be the basis for future studies comprising larger sample sizes. Specifically, by showing that short-term lifestyle modifications can alter serum levels of the observed biomarkers, the present findings will be the foundation for a subsequent analysis of of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) in the larger lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-2 main study.",43197baf-0fbf-4a16-8e9e-e9ad1432729a
42,discussion17,"  In the present analysis we only explored the dynamics of of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) in individuals with a gBRCA1/2 mutation. While serum levels of of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) in healthy individuals have been evaluated in a number of clinical studies, the physiological ranges differ greatly. While compared to some studies, the median concentrations for both biomarkers seem to be higher in our cohort than in age-matched reference subjects [72, 73], both biomarkers were within normal range according to other references [74, 75]. Whether these differences compared to healthy women are due to the gBRCA1/2 mutation or other factors is currently unclear and subject to further research.  With our analysis, we focused on the potential influences of exercise and nutritional habits on biomarker serum levels.",f42841b7-c680-402b-80ab-ca909a5d8296
43,discussion18," While highlighting the preventive potential of health habits in reaching favorable biomarker constellations, this approach does not provide prognostic value. So far, there are ambiguous findings whether of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) actually are prognostic markers for BC risk. While Vik et al. reported a significantly inverse association between of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and BRCA1/2-associated BC risk [76], Kotsopoulos and colleagues did not find evidence for an association between plasma of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) [77] or sRANK ligand (RANKL) [78] levels and BC risk. However, the validity of their study might be limited as plasma samples were collected in the late 1990s and hence stored over 20 years, possibly altering protein concentrations.",967d34ff-f333-4a6f-ac89-2cb9d8ceb3d9
44,discussion19," Furthermore, Kotsopoulos et al. postulate that a single measurement of of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL) is able to predict the BC risk in the future. This stands in contrast to our findings, suggesting the biomarkers are dynamic and responsive to lifestyle changes also in the short term.  Conclusion  The aim of our analysis was to objectively demonstrate the effects of a controlled lifestyle intervention, including physical activity and adherence to a MedD, on serum concentrations of of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sRANK ligand (RANKL).",683274ab-fd13-4135-9b3c-99f792f7ddcc
45,discussion20,"  Showing that changes in health habits can lead to favorable changes in biomarker levels, especially of nuclear factor κB (RANK)/soluble RANK ligand (sRANK ligand (RANKL))/osteoprotegerin (OPG) may provide a first step in research for establishing clinical risk factors as well as potential preventative options for gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers with regards to the incidence of hereditary BC disease.
