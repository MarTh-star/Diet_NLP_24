0,methods0," Prospective cohort study framed in the PREDIMED-Plus-Cognition sub-study. The PREDIMED-Plus clinical trial aims to compare the cardiovascular effect of two MedDiet interventions, with and without energy restriction, in individuals with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome. The present sub-study included 487 cognitively normal subjects (50.5% women, mean ± SD age of 65.2 ± 4.7 years), 30.4% of them (N = 148) with type 2 diabetes. A comprehensive battery of neurocognitive tests was administered at baseline and after 1 and 3 years. Individuals with type 2 diabetes that exhibited a good glycemic control trajectory, either using or not using metformin, were compared to one another and to individuals without diabetes using mixed-effects models with inverse probability of treatment weights.   Study Design and Participants  The present study is a prospective cohort study framed in the PREDIMED-Plus-Cognition sub-study, using a subset of participants (N = 487) of the PREDIMED-Plus trial.",7aaa8c57-3506-4494-9a22-a0468c640633

Further details on the study inclusion/exclusion criteria as well as the study protocol are available at http://predimedplus.com/. Briefly, the PREDIMED-Plus study is an ongoing multi-center randomized parallel-group primary prevention trial (N = 6,874) designed to assess and compare the long-term effectiveness of an intensive lifestyle intervention with an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet (er-MedDiet, intervention group), physical activity (PA) promotion and behavioral support of weight loss goals, with a more common intervention featuring energy-unrestricted traditional MedDiet recommendations without any recommendations on PA and weight loss strategies (control group). In order to promote the adherence to the MedDiet both groups were free provided with an allotment of extra-virgin olive oil (1 L/month) and occasionally, tree nuts (125 g/month).",401a861d-ede6-49cc-8915-a38b448c9853

Finally, a cognitive screening was also included at baseline using the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) (26).  Composite scores of 3 cognitive domains, namely memory, executive function and global cognition, were calculated for each participant by standardizing raw test scores to z-scores using the mean and standard deviation of baseline data.",0553a63e-e910-45b2-8725-2a5fe31580cd

8,methods8,"  Depressive Symptomatology  The severity of depressive symptomatology was assessed using the Beck's Depression Inventory-II (Beck's Depression Inventory II (BDI)-II) (27) and was categorized according to general guidelines as no or minimal depression (0–9 points), mild-to-moderate depression (10–18 points), moderate-to-severe depression (19–29 points), and severe depression (≥30 points).  Anthropometry and Cardiovascular Biomarkers  Weight and height were measured by nurses using standardized procedures. BMI (kg/m2) was categorized as normo-weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9 kg/m2), obesity I (BMI 30.0–34.9 kg/m2), and obesity II (BMI 35.0–39.9 kg/m2).  Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c and lipid levels (triglycerides, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol) were determined using standard methodology after an overnight fast. LDL cholesterol concentrations were calculated using the Friedewald formula whenever triglycerides were lower than 300 mg/dL.",edef12e0-cc79-42ce-a554-b889fefaad79
9,methods9," Insulin was centrally measured by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using an Elecsys immunoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). Insulin resistance was estimated at baseline using the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index (28).  Intervention Adherence  Adherence to the er-MedDiet was evaluated with an adapted version of the validated 14-item PREDIMED questionnaire including 17-items, the energy-restricted Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (er-MEDAS) (29). Values ranged from 0 to 17 points and adherence was categorized as low (0–7 points), moderate (8–10 points), and high (11–17 points) using the cut-off values from previous studies based on approximate tertiles in the overall baseline PREDIMED-Plus sample (30). Physical activity categories (sedentary, under-active, moderately active, and active) were obtained from the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA)) questionnaire (31).",274bea96-6f90-42e9-b92d-5f62ec63c782
10,methods10,"  Covariates  Covariates were evaluated at baseline through face-to-face interviews by trained staff using self-reported general questionnaires on socio-demographics (gender, age, years of education, employment status), lifestyle (smoking status), medication (use of treatment for high cholesterol, use of tranquilizers, or sedatives for anxiety or sleeping, use of medication for hypertension, use of medication for heart) and history of disease.  Statistical Analyses  Identification of Latent HbA1c Trajectories Subgroups  Longitudinal finite mixture modeling was applied to explain the between-subject heterogeneity in growth of HbA1c by identifying latent classes or subgroups with different growth trajectories (32). Thus, each latent class represents a group of subjects sharing a similar HbA1c trajectory.",02de63f2-cabb-443a-a129-d8058db9fb44
11,methods11," We first applied latent class growth analysis (latent class growth analysis (LCGA)), and two different types of growth mixture modeling (growth mixture modeling (GMM)): growth mixture modeling (GMM) with random intercept and growth mixture modeling (GMM) with random intercept and slope. In each type of model, we tested 1–5 latent classes, so 15 models were computed in total. In order to select the model with the best or most reasonable representation of the observed data, our model selection criteria were based on lowest fit information criteria statistics, including the Bayesian Information Criterion (Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)), the Akaike Information Criterion (Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)) and the sample-size adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (SABayesian Information Criterion (BIC)), as well as at high entropy. Entropy is a measure of classification uncertainty in class assignment, with higher values indicating clearer delineation of classes.",c3888c81-5378-433d-9a07-4a4488a794f1
12,methods12," All these models did not include any covariates. Once the best model was selected among this first set of 15 models, we compared it with 3 additional models that included covariates (intervention group, diabetes medications or time-by-group interaction) as predictors of the growth factors and the class. Following the previously mentioned criteria for model selection, the best model was finally selected. The selected model presented a good discrimination index, since subjects classified in class 1, 2, and 3 had a mean probability of 98.4, 89.9, and 93.2% of belonging to their class, respectively. See details in Supplementary Table 2.  Descriptive and Inferential Statistics  Descriptive statistics of study variables stratified by diabetes status (yes/no) and by diabetes subgroups were obtained as mean and standard deviation (SD) or 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables.",ee78eaa6-307f-4e66-8219-9d76edcecbe9
13,methods13," Univariate differences were estimated with the unpaired t test for continuous variables and chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as deemed appropriate, for categorical variables. Additionally, standardized mean differences between groups were computed as Cohen's d (abbreviated as “d”) with cut-offs for effect size interpretation of 0.2 (small), 0.5 (medium), 0.8 (large), and 1.2 (very large). Adjusted differences between diabetes subgroups at each time point (baseline, 1 and 3 years) were estimated with analysis of variance (and 3 years) were estimated with analysis of variance (ANOVA)) from linear models adjusted by study site, years of education, use of treatment for high cholesterol, use of metformin and use of insulin. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed with the Tukey method when the explanatory variable was normally distributed and the Benjamini & Hochberg method otherwise.",93e68d22-3f13-4122-8f3f-a20871309ebc
14,methods14," Finally, linear mixed effects models were used to test differences between groups in the mean rate of change in cognition from baseline, after 1 and 3 years.  Inverse Probability of Treatment Weights  Given that metformin was not randomly assigned, it was necessary to achieve comparability between groups with regard to pretreatment characteristics to reduce the potential confounding by indication bias and to get better estimates of the treatment effect. This was accomplished using inverse probability of treatment weights (inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW)) (33). inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) are based on propensity scores estimated via generalized boosted models, a non-parametric machine-learning method that weights treated and control cases to estimate the population average treatment effect (average treatment effect (ATE)) weights.",15c64686-8c19-4614-a1cd-136a6b97c211
15,methods15," inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) were used to generate a weighted “artificial” population (called “pseudo-population”) with almost perfect covariate balance, in which treatment and measured pretreatment characteristics are independent. Three different inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) were computed for each one of the following comparisons: (i) individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin vs. individuals with type 2 diabetes not treated with metformin, (ii) individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin vs. individuals without type 2 diabetes, and (iii) individuals with type 2 diabetes not treated with metformin vs. individuals without type 2 diabetes. Absolute standardized difference in means or proportions (abbreviated as “D”), was used to evaluate comparability between groups before and after inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) matching.",66a5734d-e3b4-42e2-b806-0eb17ff92e15
16,methods16," The relative influence of each variable in the models was also reported and expressed as a percentage. When there were residual differences in pretreatment characteristics between groups in the matched sample, regression adjustment was used to control for those unbalanced factors, which is known as a doubly robust approach (33). Accordingly, the comparison between individuals with diabetes exposed and not exposed to metformin was adjusted by sleep apnea. The comparison between subjects with and without diabetes and subjects taking metformin was adjusted by years of education, smoking status, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and use of treatment for high cholesterol. All the subsequent analyses were performed using weighted regression with robust standard errors.  Missing Data and Software  Missing data was reported as absolute and relative frequencies (N, %) and each specific analysis was performed on individuals with complete information on the variables involved.",297ad787-f187-4ff0-a13b-b1521e6897ef

18,results0," Most subjects with type 2 diabetes (83.1%) presented a good and stable glycemic control trajectory. Before engaging in the MedDiet intervention, subjects using metformin scored higher in executive functions (Cohen's d = 0.51), memory (Cohen's d = 0.38) and global cognition (Cohen's d = 0.48) than those not using metformin. However, these differences were not sustained during the 3 years of follow-up, as individuals not using metformin experienced greater improvements in memory (β = 0.38 vs. β = 0.10, P = 0.036), executive functions (β = 0.36 vs. β = 0.02, P = 0.005) and global cognition (β = 0.29 vs. β = −0.02, P = 0.001) that combined with a higher MedDiet adherence (12.6 vs. 11.5 points, P = 0.031). Finally, subjects without diabetes presented greater improvements in memory than subjects with diabetes irrespective of their exposure to metformin (β = 0.55 vs. β = 0.10, P < 0.001).",d041049d-9b7e-4ad3-9ea2-675ec8ed254c
19,results3," Individuals with diabetes are at increased risk of blindness, lower limb amputation, and cardiovascular and kidney diseases, and have about 60% greater risk of developing dementia (2).  Diabetes consequences can be avoided or delayed with good glycemic control and the management of cardiovascular risk factors, which can be achieved by following a healthy diet, practicing regular physical activity, and smoking cessation (3). In individuals with type 2 diabetes, the traditional Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been shown to improve their glycemic control, various cardiovascular risk factors, and body weight (4, 5). In individuals without diabetes but with high cardiovascular risk, the MedDiet has also been shown to decrease the incidence of diabetes (6). Moreover, adherence to the MedDiet has been associated with improvements in some cognitive functions (7).",362a31e7-808e-4fbf-878a-a58e95b5bb96
20,results4," Therefore, although type 2 diabetes has been associated with worse performance in executive functions (8), MedDiet interventions could be beneficial controlling glycemic levels and could prevent cognitive decline and even improve cognition in individuals with type 2 diabetes.  As lifestyle and weight management alone often fail to establish and sustain optimal glycemic control, glucose-lowering treatments are also an important component of diabetes management (3). Diabetes drugs may have indirect effects on the brain by affecting circulating concentrations of insulin and glucose (9, 10). However, although type 2 diabetes has been consistently associated with incident dementia, distinguishing between treated and untreated diabetes as a risk factor for dementia is challenging in most observational studies (11).",96d262bb-f68c-408d-a043-691251203cd6
21,results5," Metformin has been used since the 1950s as first-line pharmacotherapy for treating patients with type 2 diabetes with good glycemic control because of its glucose-lowering effects, good safety profile and relatively low cost. However, for patients with poor glycemic control after this first-line therapy, alternative oral glucose-lowering medications and/or injectable insulin are preferable, in monotherapy or in combination with other therapy regimens (12).  Previous studies have shown that metformin use for more than 6 years was associated with lower risk of cognitive impairment (13) and with better performance in some cognitive domains over time in cognitively normal subjects with type 2 diabetes (14). However, there is currently considerable controversy about the effect of metformin on cognition (15).",865fc7de-b849-407b-ac71-8ee79738824d
22,results6," Given the varied response to glucose lowering medications and the heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes (16), the identification of different glycemic trajectory subgroups could help optimize the study of the effects of metformin on cognition. Thus, the analysis of trajectories of glycemic control is an important initial step toward the application of personalized medicine in the treatment of diabetes as it could help in the development of targeted strategies to improve the effectiveness of interventions (17).  The objective of this study is to characterize different glycemic trajectories subgroups and to examine the association between metformin use and cognition in subjects with type 2 diabetes that participated in the PREDIMED-Plus MedDiet intervention.

39,discussion0," Main Findings  This is the first study to date to examine the effect of metformin on cognition in older adults with type 2 diabetes following a MedDiet intervention. We first examined the heterogeneity in HbA1c trajectories after 1 and 3 years of dietary intervention. We identified three different subgroups of individuals with diabetes irrespective of the intervention group. The largest group exhibited good glycemic control that remained stable during the follow-up, while the remaining two subgroups showed poor baseline glycemic control that improved or worsened during the follow-up. Among the group with good glycemic control, we observed that those treated with metformin presented a better baseline performance in memory, executive functions and global cognition than those not treated with metformin.",36800aad-87db-474e-aeec-7fd02f17f9c3
40,discussion1," However, those not treated with metformin presented higher adherence to the MedDiet over time as well as greater improvements in memory, executive functions and global cognition, so that baseline differences between individuals with type 2 diabetes treated and not treated with metformin vanished after 1 and 3 years of MedDiet intervention. These results suggest that adherence to a MedDiet intervention could be superior to the potential neuroprotective effects of metformin among older adults with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome who have good glycemic control of their type 2 diabetes.  Metformin Use and Cognition in Individuals With Diabetes  Our results suggest that metformin could have neuroprotective effects.",dd3fef6e-fd8c-491d-ac43-50337e35da13
41,discussion2," Specifically, we observed that before starting the MedDiet intervention, individuals with type 2 diabetes from a group presenting good glycemic control (S1) treated with metformin presented a higher performance in memory, executive functions and global cognition than those not treated with metformin. These results agree with previous observational studies showing better memory performance (14) or greater maintenance of executive functions and global cognition (34) in cognitively normal subjects with diabetes type 2 treated with metformin, compared to those not treated with metformin. Metformin use has also been associated with lower dementia risk (35, 36) and better cognitive function (37), but results are still highly variable across studies (15). These inconsistencies could be explained by the fact that multiple neurocognitive pathways are affected by diabetes. Therefore, some pathways, but not all, may be improved with drug therapy (e.g., neurovascular alterations) (38).",c85f2ff2-ae23-490c-8f73-6140941e9471
42,discussion3," Moreover, metformin has the adverse effect of lowering serum vitamin B12 concentration, which can in turn, increase the risk of cognitive impairment (39).  Metformin mainly acts by reducing liver gluconeogenesis and inhibiting glucagon-mediated signaling in the liver, but it can also cross the blood brain barrier and thus affect the brain more directly (40). However, the potential neuroprotective effects of metformin have been mostly attributed to its anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulative properties, the prevention of metabolic syndrome (41) and the reduction of peripheral insulin levels that affect brain clearance of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) (42). Several clinical trials have also tested the effects of metformin in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) (43) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) (40).",ee1bfb5e-7270-4c82-96f6-238439e5a44c
43,discussion4," In a pilot study in individuals with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (N = 80), metformin treatment for 12 months marginally improved the selective reminding score, but did not affect the global cognitive composite (ADAS-Cog) (43). However, in a cross-over RCT with 20 individuals with AD, metformin treatment for 8 weeks improved executive function and trends also suggested improved memory, learning and attention (40). These preliminary findings support the need for larger trials to evaluate the efficacy and cognitive safety of metformin in prodromal and dementia stages of AD, such as the one recently promoted by the University of Columbia (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04098666).",13f2de7f-52eb-4889-9a7a-c0447bd92d71
44,discussion5,"  Mediterranean Diet Adherence and Cognition in Individuals With Diabetes  Our results also suggest that a higher adherence to the MedDiet could reverse the cognitive disadvantage of those subjects with diabetes that were not treated with metformin, since both groups with diabetes achieved similar cognitive scores along the follow-up. Subjects with diabetes from S1 not treated with metformin presented improvements in memory, executive functions and global cognition composites during the 3 years of follow-up, but cognition remained almost stable among those treated with metformin. Moreover, subjects with diabetes who were not exposed to metformin showed greater adherence to the MedDiet after 3 years of follow-up. The reason for this is unknown, but this indicates a group of subjects with a high capacity to make lifestyle changes.",0fa6fc62-581c-45d1-9598-eccdd11b5652
45,discussion6," In fact, prior to participating in this study, most subjects from this group were able to control their blood glucose without medication and when offered a lifestyle intervention they adhered to it very faithfully, which probably translated into cognitive improvement. Another possibility is that those individuals with type 2 diabetes who take anti-diabetic drugs value lifestyle interventions less than those who do not take any drugs. Moreover, the greater compliance with the MedDiet among individuals with type 2 diabetes not taking metformin at baseline may also explain why they did not require metformin during the 3 years of follow-up. Previous studies have already reported the delayed need of medication for diabetes in patients with a newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes after a MedDiet intervention, compared to a low-fat diet (44, 45).",31961b5f-9dba-4240-9bae-c0f31af44fe3
46,discussion7,"  The favorable effect of the MedDiet intervention was likely due to the overall composition of the dietary pattern and not to a decreased caloric intake, weight loss or increased physical activity, because the allocation to the intervention or control group was balanced among subjects with diabetes either treated and not treated with metformin. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, the MedDiet has been consistently associated with better glycemic control (reduction of HbA1c by 0.32–0.53%) and a better profile of cardiovascular risk factors, compared to low-fat diets (4). These mechanisms could explain why adherence to the MedDiet might improve cognition in individuals with type 2 diabetes (46, 47).",1e1fa22b-499e-420f-a4f2-7eb723b82f1e
47,discussion8," The high content in plant-based foods of the MedDiet (olive oil, legumes, vegetables, fruit, cereals, and nuts), along with fish and moderate red wine consumption during meals, make the MedDiet rich in phenolic compounds, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamins that, in conjunction, may contribute to a reduced oxidative stress and chronic inflammation and better neurovascular health (48, 49).  Differences Between Individuals With and Without Diabetes  When individuals with diabetes were compared to those without diabetes, we did not find baseline differences in memory, executive functions and global cognition composites. These results differ from previous cross-sectional studies in the overall PREDIMED-Plus population (N = 6,823) showing worse executive functioning (evaluated with different neuropsychological tests) at baseline among participants with type 2 diabetes (8).",844d7bc0-50ec-4447-afcb-7810d786feb8
48,discussion9," However, we observed that participants with diabetes experienced fewer improvements in memory than participants without diabetes after 3 years of follow-up.  Nevertheless, in our study subjects with diabetes not treated with metformin experienced a greater increase in their executive functions than subjects without diabetes after 3 years of follow-up. Therefore, their greater adherence to the MedDiet could explain this difference in the rate of change in executive functions. In turn, MedDiet adherence did not differ between subjects with diabetes treated with metformin and subjects without diabetes. However, those using metformin experienced a lower improvement in their memory after 1 and 3 years, and in their global cognition after 3 years of follow-up, compared to subjects without diabetes. Thus, in the face of equivalent adherence to MedDiet, metformin was unable to neutralize the negative impact of type 2 diabetes on cognition.",f629df5a-9d11-4c33-80cc-e6cda8f6dfd2
49,discussion10,"  Strengths  The strengths of this study include its longitudinal design with 3 years of follow-up and the large number of cognitive tests that are administered to participants, covering 12 different cognitive abilities that are grouped in memory, executive functions and global cognitive composites. Moreover, the methodology used in the analysis of results allowed us to minimize confounding by indication which is not frequently addressed in most studies of metformin and cognitive associations. Finally, we also described the heterogeneity in the response to a MedDiet intervention among individuals with diabetes type 2, which aligns with the current recommendations of more patient-centered research and care in the field of diabetes (3).  Limitations  However, this study has several limitations. First, the small sample size of the population with diabetes (N = 148) leads to a small number of participants in the subgroups with poor glycemic control (N = 17 in S2 and N = 8 in S3).",8d8c0e97-7c55-4200-8f4f-6d2c90238059
50,discussion11," This limits the capacity to detect statistically significant differences in their baseline characteristics. Moreover, when testing the associations between metformin use and cognition within the group presenting good glycemic control (S1), the small sample size of the untreated (N = 36) and treated (N = 87) groups also limited the study of gender effects, which should be addressed in future studies. Moreover, this sample size constraint also prevented the stratification of subjects exposed and not exposed to metformin according to their adherence to the MedDiet (high/medium/low). Consequently, it was not possible to study the simultaneous effect (interaction) of metformin use and high MedDiet adherence on cognition.  Second, there were losses in the evaluation of the cognitive function during the follow-up (within S1, 14% in the first year and 18% in the third year).",bed435c6-cb69-4daf-af13-cff5593fa470
51,discussion12," They were not unexpected given the burden of neuropsychological visits and the fact that visits of this sub-study were performed on different days to those of the main trial. In addition, executive functions and global cognition composites excluded participants from the UV study site (representing 27% of subjects from S1) since not all the tests that made up the construct of executive functions were administered in this site. Therefore, selection bias cannot be completely excluded from this study.  Third, our methodology was not suitable for investigating causal effects since metformin administration was not randomized, and we did not collect data on the duration of metformin use, specific doses, or patients' adherence to their medication regimens. However, we noted that participants did not change their metformin treatment during the 3 years of follow-up. Moreover, we used inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) to match treated and untreated subjects in each comparison.",5ba57bf6-6238-4e15-adbf-8aa0c815266f
52,discussion13," This approach allows to account for systematic differences in comorbidities between groups and is used to limit confounding by indication. We also had no information about the APOE genotype of participants, which could influence the association between metformin use and cognitive decline, as reported in previous studies (14).  Finally, this study does not have a control group since all subjects were exposed to a MedDiet intervention. However, without any intervention, individuals with metabolic syndrome would have probably presented a cognitive decline over time (50) and in this study their cognition improved independently of their underlying pathological condition.  Conclusions  In summary, both metformin and MedDiet seem to have neuroprotective effects in older adults at increased risk of pathological cognitive decline, presenting overweight/obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.",3fbdd122-9d2c-4187-98f5-05ded02ffccc
53,discussion14," Given the heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes and in the response to lifestyle interventions and glucose-lowering medications, a group-based trajectory analysis was initially performed to stratify the population with diabetes. There were two minor subgroups with high HbA1c levels that did not achieve good glycemic control despite of the intensive MedDiet intervention. Future studies should consider applying more intensive and personalized dietary interventions to subjects with poor glycemic control of their type 2 diabetes. However, the majority subgroup of individuals with type 2 diabetes presented good glycemic control throughout the follow-up. In this subgroup, metformin treatment was associated with better memory, executive functions and global cognition at baseline. Nevertheless, after 1 and 3 years of MedDiet intervention, both metformin-treated and non-metformin-treated subjects achieved similar cognitive function.",247c32ad-d4d2-4bb4-b6b9-dade0c038cd2
54,discussion15," We postulate that increased adherence to the MedDiet explained the cognitive improvement observed in individuals with type 2 diabetes not treated with metformin. In conclusion, a high adherence to MedDiet seems to at least slow down cognitive decline in the elderly with metabolic syndrome and other chronic diseases. Our results support the hypothesis that both metformin and MedDiet interventions are good candidates for future cognitive decline preventive studies.
