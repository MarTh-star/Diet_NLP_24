0,background0," Glucose metabolism has been reported to be affected by dietary patterns, while the underlying mechanisms involved remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential mediation role of circulating metabolites in relation to dietary patterns for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. ",0661c193-3f14-4323-b618-013871107a24
1,methods0," Study design and population  Data from The Maastricht Study, an observational, prospective, population-based cohort study was used. The rationale and methodology have been described previously [14]. In brief, this study focuses on the aetiology, pathophysiology, complications, and comorbidities of type 2 diabetes and is characterised by an extensive phenotyping approach. Eligible for participation were individuals between 40 and 75 years of age living in the southern part of the Netherlands. Participants were recruited through mass media campaigns and from the municipal registries and the regional Diabetes Patient Registry via mailings. Recruitment was stratified according to known type 2 diabetes status, with an oversampling of individuals with type 2 diabetes for reasons of efficiency. For the current study 3807 participants, who completed the baseline survey between November 2010 and November 2013, were eligible for inclusion.",c7b656fe-0f19-4264-b023-6f57bb06162d
2,methods1," The examinations of each participant were performed within a time window of 3 months after finishing the baseline survey.  The exclusion criteria for participants included in the further analysis were performed as follows: (1) 48 participants without measured metabolites; (2) 43 participants without information on glucose metabolism status; (3) 168 participants with implausible energy intakes (<800 or >4200 kcal/day for men, and <500 or >3,500 kcal/day for women) [15]; (4) 69 participants of whom data on dietary assessment was incomplete for the calculation of dietary patterns; (5) 38 non-Caucasian participants. Finally, a total of 3441 participants, of which 1960 individuals with normal glucose metabolism (normal glucose metabolism (NGM)), 514 with prediabetes and 967 with type 2 diabetes by design, were included in the current study (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Overview of the study design.",7cdd8b6a-93ca-491e-867a-985e83a20534
3,methods2," Fasting blood samples were obtained, and plasma were extracted to quantify the circulation metabolites based on NMR platform. Diet was assessed at baseline by a validated, self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) developed based on the Dutch national food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) tool, which was then calculated into dietary patterns, i.e. Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean Diet (MED)), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Diet (DASH)) Diet, and Dutch Healthy Diet (Dutch Healthy Diet (DHD)). Participants underwent a standardized 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) after fasting overnight along with information about diabetes medication to determine the glucose metabolism status (glucose metabolism status (GMS)), which was defined based on the World Health Organization 2006 criteria as; normal glucose metabolism, normal glucose metabolism (NGM), fasting plasma glucose <6.1 mmol/L; prediabetes, fasting plasma glucose of 6.1–6.",f804bced-87b8-485e-8ebf-3fc8f0cbc3ab

After centrifuging, plasma was stored at −80°C. Metabolite measures were quantified from EDTA plasma samples using the high-throughput 1H-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) metabolomics platform (Nightingale Health Ltd., Helsinki, Finland; https://nightingalehealth.com) at two separate occasions, i.e. years 2014 and 2016, respectively [16].",68544eb4-fce9-4cd2-bfb0-fe96796b9c7c

Metabolite measures that failed quality control (i.e. glutamine, pyruvate, glycerol, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetate) were excluded from the analysis. The final set of metabolite measures included 145 metabolites and 81 metabolite ratios in the current study, comprising total lipid concentrations, fatty acids composition and low-molecular-weight metabolites including ketone bodies, glycolysis-related metabolites, amino-acids, and metabolites related to immunity and fluid balance.",728a6bf8-612b-4651-bbd8-6167261c3933

Missing data for absolute metabolite measures were imputed using R package Missforest [18]. Zero values in absolute measures were replaced by half of the lowest value of each corresponding metabolite. Then, metabolite ratios were recalculated according to the complete matrix of metabolites. In order to normalize all the metabolite measures, a 10th percentile value (based on the distribution of the absolute measure/ratio under investigation) was added and subsequently ln-transformed. Finally, the obtained values were scaled to standard deviation units with normal distributions.",a0edaa1f-a7d7-4e6a-9063-e4bacf7a63dc
8,methods7,"  Assessment of glucose metabolism status  Participants underwent a standardized 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) after fasting overnight along with information about diabetes medication to determine the glucose metabolism status (glucose metabolism status (GMS)), which was defined based on the World Health Organization 2006 criteria as; normal glucose metabolism, normal glucose metabolism (NGM), fasting plasma glucose <6.1 mmol/L (glucose metabolism status (GMS) score=0); prediabetes, fasting plasma glucose of 6.1–6.9 mmol/L and no hypoglycaemic medications (glucose metabolism status (GMS) score=1); and type 2 diabetes, fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L or hypoglycaemic medications (glucose metabolism status (GMS) score=2) [19]. For safety reasons, participants using insulin or with a fasting plasma glucose (fasting plasma glucose (FPG)) value above 11.0 mmol/L (determined by finger prick) did not undergo the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).",2387d26f-f3b5-4857-817b-e54032ff48ab
9,methods8," For these individuals, the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) value and diabetes medication information were used to determine glucose metabolism status (GMS). A higher glucose metabolism status (GMS) score indicates a poorer glycaemic control, and each pair of glucose metabolism status (GMS) comparison was defined as that the glucose metabolism status (GMS) was developed from normal glucose metabolism (NGM) to prediabetes, from normal glucose metabolism (NGM) to type 2 diabetes, or from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes.  Assessment of dietary patterns  Diet was assessed at baseline by a validated, self-administered food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)), i.e. Maastricht-food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), developed based on the Dutch national food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) tool [20].",a3ea0094-df18-4b0f-9a6a-8f9a15c781bf
10,methods9," The Maastricht-food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) assessed the amount and frequency of intakes from 23 product groups comprising 253 food items within a reference period of one year. Intake of total energy and nutrients was calculated using the Dutch Food Composition Database (nutrients was calculated using the Dutch Food Composition Database (NEVO)) [21]. More details on the development and the validity of this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) have been reported elsewhere [22]; briefly, the Maastricht-food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) selected food items with the largest contributions to both absolute intake and explained variance in intake of energy and 24 nutrients based on the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey 2007–2010 [23].",3ebaecb4-9e70-4883-b8fc-3d25b8394e89
11,methods10," In addition, the Maastricht-food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was validated within the Nutrition Questionnaires plus (NQplus) study population [24], where the population characteristics in The Maastricht Study [25] were generally comparable with the NQplus population with respect to age, BMI, smoking status, educational attainment and food items.  Mediterranean Diet (Mediterranean Diet (MED)) score  The Mediterranean Diet (MED) score was based on 9 food components (i.e. vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, fish, cereals, dairy, meat, ratio [MUFA (monounsaturated fatty acids) + PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids)]/SFA (saturated fatty acids), and alcohol, with sex-specific medians of intakes as cut-off values. The median intake for food groups was derived from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). For healthy components (i.e.",190a396c-e072-4790-a730-7dd5dd098db0
12,methods11," vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, fish, cereals, ratio (MUFA+PUFA)/SFA), a score of 0 was assigned for intake below the median of each food component, while a score of 1 was granted for intake higher or equal to the median of each food component. For unhealthy food components (i.e. red and processed meats, and dairy products), the scores were inverted (1 for intake below the median, 0 for intake above the median). Regarding alcohol consumption, a score of 1 was allocated if consumption was between 10 and 50 g/day for males and between 5 and 25 g/day for females, and a score of 0 for any other amount of alcohol consumption. The sum of the scores for each food component resulted in the overall Mediterranean Diet (MED) score (minimum 0, maximum 9) [26].  Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Diet (DASH)) score  The Diet (DASH) score was based on 8 food components (i.e.",4545afff-1925-4d08-9c6d-6ab31827eda4
13,methods12," vegetables, fruits, nuts and legumes, wholegrain products, low-fat dairy, red and processed meat, sugar sweetened beverages, and sodium intake) with sex-specific quintiles as cut-off values. For each food component, the score ranged between 1 and 5, which was assigned proportionally to the intake level. A higher intake of healthy food components (i.e. vegetables, fruits, nuts and legumes, wholegrain products, low-fat dairy) or unhealthy food components (i.e. red and processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and sodium intake) corresponded to higher scores. The sum of the scores for each food group resulted in the overall Diet (DASH) score (minimum 8, maximum 40) [27].  Dutch Healthy Diet (Dutch Healthy Diet (DHD)) score  The Dutch Healthy Diet (DHD) score (version 2015) was used to measure the adherence to Dutch dietary guidelines of 2015, consisting of 15 food components (i.e.",be43ac8e-2b1e-4224-9256-d27e480936f4
14,methods13," vegetables, fruits, wholegrain products, legumes, nuts, fish, tea, dairy, fats and oils, coffee, red meat, processed meat, sweetened beverages and fruit juices, alcohol, and salt) [28]. For each healthy food component (i.e. vegetables, fruits, wholegrain products, legumes, nuts, fish, tea), intake equal to or higher than a cut-off value, specified according to the dietary guidelines, the maximum score (score=10) was given, while for intakes below that cut-off value the score was calculated by means of linear interpolation between threshold value (score=0) and cut-off value (score=10). For each unhealthy food component (i.e.",bc2e3624-c1a1-44cd-a57f-c08520677de2
15,methods14," dairy, fats and oils, red meat, processed meat, sweetened beverages and fruit juices, alcohol, and salt), the maximum score (score=10) was assigned if the intake was equal to or below a specific cut-off value, whereas for intake higher than that cut-off value the score was calculated by means of linear interpolation between the cut-off value (score=10) and the threshold value (score=0). The sum of the scores for each food group resulted in the overall Dutch Healthy Diet (DHD) score (minimum 0, maximum 140). A detailed description of the operationalization has been described elsewhere [28] (Additional file 1: Table S2).",5b346fdc-4ccb-4f84-96ba-33f754f719ee
16,methods15,"  Assessment of covariates  Covariates that were extracted from the questionnaire included age (years, continuous), sex (male or female), body mass index (BMI, kg/m2, continuous), education level (low, middle, or high), household income (<2000 euros/month, 2000–3750 euros/month, or ≥3750 euros/month), smoking status (never, current, or former smoker), energy intake (kcal/day, continuous), daily glucose intake (mmol/mol, continuous), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, ml/min, continuous), total physical activity (h/week, continuous) [29], history of cardiovascular disease (yes or no), use of lipid-modification medication (yes or no), and the year for metabolomics measurement (2014 or 2016). Covariates were obtained from physical examination, laboratory assessment, food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and medication interview. For categorial variables, missing data, i.e. smoking status (1.28%), level of education (1.95%), level of household income (4.",efe01a2a-8247-40ec-8c19-4109f916495e

Differences between normal glucose metabolism (NGM), prediabetes and type 2 diabetes at baseline, including 3 dietary-pattern scores, were compared by ANOVA test for continuous variables, and chi-squared test for categorial variables.  The dietary pattern scores were divided into 3 tertiles for standardization: low adherence (tertile 1), middle adherence (tertile 2), and high adherence (tertile 3). Firstly, we performed a crude and adjusted ordinal logistic regression analysis (STATA package ologit [30]) to evaluate the association between each dietary pattern and the glucose metabolism status (GMS) score (i.e. normal glucose metabolism (NGM) vs. prediabetes vs. type 2 diabetes).",d81cced9-e689-4f27-becc-645f7271c230
19,analysis1," In addition, a logistic regression analysis was performed for the compare the glucose metabolism status (GMS) score in pairs (i.e. pair 1; glucose metabolism status (GMS) score 0 (normal glucose metabolism (NGM)) vs 1 (prediabetes), pair 2 ; glucose metabolism status (GMS) score 0 (normal glucose metabolism (NGM)) vs 2 (type 2 diabetes), pair 3; glucose metabolism status (GMS) score 1 (prediabetes) vs 2 (type 2 diabetes)), based on a crude and adjusted model (STATA package logit [31]). The main interaction terms (glucose metabolism status (GMS) score with sex and BMI) were added to the adjusted model (P-interaction<0.05 was considered statistically significant).  To further investigate the associations of dietary patterns with glucose metabolism, i.e. Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), we employed a linear regression analysis with stratification on sexes and BMI (i.e. obesity: BMI≥30 kg/m2, and non-obesity: BMI<30 kg/m2).",ad6f6eaf-b9a5-46c2-9f81-74620489118e
20,analysis2," For all analyses, lowest tertile of adherence was used as the reference group. A P value for trend test was conducted by assigning medians to per tertile as a continuous variable in the models.  Secondly, we used a linear regression analysis (STATA package regression [32]) to examine the associations between each dietary pattern and metabolite measures. For this, each metabolite measure was used as the dependent variable, and dietary pattern scores were used as the independent variable. In addition, the metabolite measures associated with the glucose metabolism status (GMS) score and with the defined glucose metabolism status (GMS) pairs were assessed based on ordinal and binary logistic regression respectively. Again, both crude and adjusted models were performed.  Thirdly, an adjusted mediation analysis was used to examine whether the metabolite measures that were both associated with dietary patterns and glucose metabolism status (GMS) are potential mediators.",b94419b2-5504-4bea-9516-49668de89583
21,analysis3," The significance of the mediated effects was assessed using Sobel-Goodman mediation Test (STATA package sgmediation [33]).  Finally, to assess the relative risk (RR) of type 2 diabetes developed from normal glucose metabolism (NGM) or prediabetes according to the identified metabolite measures, a Poisson regression analysis was performed using self-report incidences of type 2 diabetes obtained from a yearly follow-up till 7 years (mean=5.83, standard deviation=0.91).

Sensitivity analyses were performed, for the identified metabolites by excluding the participants with incomplete data on covariates and newly type 2 diabetes diagnosed at baseline. All statistical tests were two sided. We calculated the false discovery rate (false discovery rate (FDR)) to correct for multiple testing at α<0.05 significance level.

40,discussion0," Leveraging data from a population-based cohort, this study identified a stable metabolic signature, consisting of 5 metabolite measures (i.e. APOA1, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), isoleucine, ratio of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to total fatty acids and ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids) that consistently mediates the associations between three healthy dietary patterns (i.e. Mediterranean Diet (MED), Diet (DASH), and Dutch Healthy Diet (DHD)) and glucose metabolism status (GMS), indicating the potential of a holistic dietary profile rather than individual foods/nutrients, in regulating circulating metabolites and thereby modifying the glucose metabolism. The current study is one of the largest cohorts that used targeted metabolomic technique (NMR), instead of the widely used untargeted and non-quantified techniques, for blood metabolome investigation.",1885dce7-6e35-468b-a922-588b628190f4
41,discussion1," Although it is known that targeted techniques do not achieve global coverage, this technique is thought to be more sensitive, accurate, and specific than the non-targeted metabolomics approach.  Although some healthy dietary patterns have been reported and recommended, the common critical metabolites that suit for multiple dietary patterns and in relation to metabolic disorders have yet to be well investigated and understood. In the current study, the identified metabolites, that showed to be stable in response to nutritional changes, have the potential to identify the early onset of type 2 diabetes, thereby providing a new understanding of the biological mechanisms explaining the association between diet and glucose metabolism. This could directly facilitate preventive nutritional recommendation for type 2 diabetes.  Previous studies already identified individual metabolites (e.g. caffeine, carotenoids, flavonoids, and alkyl resorcinol) being associated with dietary patterns (e.g.",02bc3f0b-9f5c-4bb4-bac0-80ec2dc714ea

Through rigorous analyses, this study firstly demonstrated the participants who adhered to healthier dietary patterns with better metabolically in glycaemic traits (i.e. glucose, HbA1c and HOMA-IR). Although mechanisms driving these dietary pattern-glycaemic traits associations are complex and multi-factorial, the metabolomic profile identified in the current study, i.e.",aa52368a-8e1e-4c20-bff9-b7fe4c27e811
43,discussion3," APOA1, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), isoleucine, ratio of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to total fatty acids and ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids, may help to imply the potential pathways for revealing the effects of dietary behaviours on glucose metabolism, which, investigations are therefore needed to elucidate the interplay between specific diet related metabolites and their metabolic and biological pathways.  APOA1, a protein with multiple therapeutic functions, has been reported to be associated with an improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and a decelerated progression of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes [43–45]. Cell and animal studies have confirmed that APOA1 activates protein kinase A (protein kinase A (PKA)), which trans-locates the transcription factor FoxO1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in a process that derepresses transcription of the insulin gene and thereby increases insulin synthesis in β-cells [46].",9e885a44-79ef-494b-884d-b7e3e4167526
44,discussion4," In-vitro studies have further established that high-density lipoproteins and APOA1 conserve β-cell function by inhibiting apoptosis in a process that is driven by oxysterol efflux and activation of the hedgehog signalling receptor [47, 48]. In addition, there is also mounting evidence that APOA1 improves glycaemic control by increasing glucose uptake into the skeletal muscle and the heart [49]. These observations are supported, at least in part, by findings from the current study which indicated that an increment of plasma APOA1 levels is an increased glucose metabolism status (GMS) score, HbA1c level, and HOMA-IR level.  Isoleucine, one of the branched-chain amino acids (branched chain amino acids (BCAA)), which mainly derives from food abundant in proteins (e.g. dairy products and meat) and is highly related to metabolic disorders [50–52], was found to be a mediator in the relation between the high adherence to the dietary patterns (i.e.",354c65c9-4cab-4036-8c01-6e2a24916ea5
45,discussion5," Mediterranean Diet (MED), Diet (DASH) and Dutch Healthy Diet (DHD)) and a lower risk of an increased glucose metabolism status (GMS) score. Similar findings were observed in a previous study conducted in the USA showing that higher dietary branched chain amino acids (BCAA) (i.e. isoleucine, leucine, valine) and plasma branched chain amino acids (BCAA) concentrations were jointly associated with an increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes risk [53]. The current study additionally shows that isoleucine mediates 25.29% to 54.32% of the relations between the dietary patterns with (a) normal glucose metabolism (NGM) vs. type 2 diabetes and (b) prediabetes vs. type 2 diabetes, thereby, suggesting indicating a distinct pathway of diet affecting type 2 diabetes through isoleucine.",f6f0e291-b4ba-46da-b1dd-798de40fffa0
46,discussion6," These findings were strengthened by experimental studies, showing that an increased level of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) affects insulin resistance by either activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which results in uncoupling of insulin signalling at an early stage, or by an impaired branched chain amino acids (BCAA) metabolism, thereby causing accumulation of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and mitochondrial dysfunction, which is associated with stress kinase activation and β-cell apoptosis [54]. Therefore, the current study not only provided evidence for a possible role of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) (i.e. isoleucine) as a biomarker for type 2 diabetes, but also indicates a plausible mediation role for branched chain amino acids (BCAA) between dietary patterns and type 2 diabetes.",0c28e92f-ed4c-4dfe-83ee-57592e64b8b4
47,discussion7," However, considering the complicated interactions between branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and many other metabolites [55], the independent effect of isoleucine on type 2 diabetes should be interpreted with caution and further investigated in future research.  Plasma docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the ratio of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to total fatty acids were shown to be positively associated with the dietary patterns (i.e. Mediterranean Diet (MED), Diet (DASH) and Dutch Healthy Diet (DHD)) and negatively associated with type 2 diabetes. This is in line with a clinical trial conducted in Australia, suggesting that fish oil enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduces insulin resistance and thereby helps to prevent type 2 diabetes [56].",c46e70cd-9246-4424-8e67-96bb890f9e85
48,discussion8," Emerging evidence shows that marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are able to ameliorate insulin resistance in rodents, probably via regulating adipocytokines secretion [57–59], inhibiting adipose remodelling [60], lowering inflammation [61], and enhancing mitochondrial function and β-oxidation [62]. A recent study investigated the individual effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on glucose metabolism and found that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) significantly attenuated hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance in db/db mice, which sheds light into the gut-organs axis as a promising target for restoring glucose homeostasis and suggests a therapeutic effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for treating diabetes [63].",52489dd9-b511-4d5c-a185-f3d75e7fcfe0
49,discussion9,"  Another interesting finding of the current study is that the ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids showed to be positively associated with glucose metabolism status (GMS) (overall increment and each pair) and negatively associated with increased scores of all assessed dietary patterns. However, no evidence of either ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids in mediating dietary patterns and glucose metabolism status (GMS) was found. ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids compete in certain metabolic pathways, e.g. sharing the same conversion enzyme and having inverse biological availability and activity in tissues. Therefore, the combined effect on glucose metabolism has gained wide discussion, but so far remains controversial [64]. Results of the present study are in line with a recently conducted study showing that the ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids has the potential to serve as an essential predictive biomarker in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes [65].",8d13da44-a36e-4346-a4ff-2aab8b44df88
50,discussion10," In addition, previous research showed that differential intakes of dietary fat subtypes may affect diabetes risk by modifying the phospholipid composition of cell membranes [66]. This effect may play a role in blood glucose regulation through action on insulin secretion and insulin receptor properties [67, 68], which leads to developing normoglycemic blood glucose levels in individuals with the lowest ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids. However, the exact balance and mechanism of the ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids has not yet been well understood; further research is, therefore, warranted.  Furthermore, by using the longitudinal data on glucose metabolism status (GMS), we observed there was 67 type 2 diabetes developed from 514 prediabetes (13%), compared to 0.97% (19 type 2 diabetes out of 1960 normal glucose metabolism (NGM), which indicated the prediabetes with a higher risk to develop to type 2 diabetes.",39bc1c15-8647-4391-95e3-df3c02fbb744
51,discussion11," Except for ratio of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to total fatty acids, though might be due to the insufficient statistical power, the rest of four identified metabolite measures showed baseline levels longitudinally associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes, which strengthen the robustness of results based on cross-sectional analysis. Particularly the ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids with evidence of prospective risk of type 2 diabetes for prediabetes but not normal glucose metabolism (NGM), which suggested it may be a key biomarker in predicting and preventing the deterioration of prediabetes. Therefore, metabolic profiling may serve as a more accurate and unbiased method to assess the impact on the relationship between diet and health outcomes.",8c564d40-5a6e-4f51-a08d-d0c6537c5e24
52,discussion12,"  Main strengths of this study are the large size of this population-based cohort study with oversampling of individuals with type 2 diabetes, which enables accurate comparison of individuals with and without diabetes, and the large number of potential confounders that were considered. Moreover, the use of the NMR platform provided standardized measures of the metabolites, allowing exploration of measures beyond routinely measured biomarkers. However, several limitations should be acknowledged; first, an external replication cohort is warranted to validate the proposed panel of metabolite measures identified in the current study; second, based on an observational study design, any causal inference should be made with caution, since bidirectional associations may exist; third, though the mediation analyses indicate the important roles of metabolites in modulating diet on glucose metabolism,",81f053af-582b-430d-ba56-0893956a5449
53,discussion13," the biological mechanism should be demonstrated with caution given that the identified metabolites might not be involved in the dominant pathways, particularly those with low proportion of mediation effects. fourth, although analyses were adjusted for known potential confounders, the possibility of unmeasured confounding (e.g. the fasting time before blood sample collection, the cooking methods, and the duration and intensity of smoking) and reverse causation remains; fifth, some of the clinical factors and dietary intakes were self-reported, therefore, misclassification errors are likely to have biased these findings toward the null; sixth, in the current study, dietary intakes were assessed by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s. Therefore, measurement error and misclassification are unavoidable due to the inability of a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to capture details information (i.e.",13bcccb4-8b47-4cb1-8688-2df85811aa5b
54,discussion14," exact food types), the difficulty in the quantification of the intake, and the high dependency on memory; finally, this sample was restricted to volunteers of European ancestry aged around 60 years at baseline and, therefore, further research is warranted to investigate to what degree these findings can be generalized to other populations.  Conclusions  In summary, this study suggests that adherence to a healthy dietary pattern (i.e. Mediterranean Diet (MED), Diet (DASH), or Dutch Healthy Diet (DHD)) could affect glucose metabolism status through the regulations of the circulating metabolite levels, particularly through APOA1, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), isoleucine, ratio of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to total fatty acids and ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids.",133b87ad-c65d-47ad-a32c-b0acaeab8428
