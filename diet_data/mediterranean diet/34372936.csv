0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Participants  This was a cross-sectional study involving web-based questionnaires. The study aimed to recruit 600 adults from the three main emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah). Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the major emirates, and the population of Sharjah is more than 50% of the remaining emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Using a proportional quota sampling method, the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority (Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority (FCSA)) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it was calculated to recruit 270 adults from Abu Dhabi, 230 from Dubai and 100 from Sharjah in order to have a representative sample from each of the three emirates.",44c91cc8-70aa-4ec6-9ba6-6772e4aca27c
1,methods1,"  The following inclusion criteria were used for the recruitment: (1) adults 18 years and older (males and females); (2) United Arab Emirates (UAE) nationals and non-nationals; (3) residing in the following three Emirates: Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah; and (4) fluent in Arabic language. The recruitment targeted three age groups: 18–30 years, 31–49 years and 50 years and older. Data was collected from July to November 2020.  Online recruitment promotion of the survey was sent through social media (including “WhatsApp™”) and emails to inform the targeted community. An email containing a link to the consent form was sent to those who showed an interest to participate. A link to the questionnaire Google document form was shared with potential participants. In addition, a link to the web-based Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) was emailed to those who agreed to participate.",f099d8ba-b1d9-4622-8432-3dd025388de7
2,methods2," Out of the 720 who responded, 610 provided complete information and were included in the analyses. The study was approved by the United Arab Emirates University Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee (Protocol # ERS_2020_6191). All procedures were following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.  2.2. Data Collection  Data was collected online using the World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS)) for collecting data on NCDs [38] and a quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).  2.2.1. STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) Instrument  The STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) instrument developed by World Health Organization (WHO) is a cross-cultural validated tool designed to produce results that enables the comparison of data across countries [39].",d74a8456-fc06-4941-9ed6-87c4d39080df
3,methods3," It was designed for the measurement and surveillance of non-communicable disease risk factors in populations [39]. The STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) instrument can be used to collect information about risk factors of NCDs, including physical inactivity and raised blood lipids, increased blood glucose and blood pressure. It covers three different levels of “steps” of risk factor assessment (a questionnaire, physical measurements and biochemical measurements). As the study was conducted online during the COVID-19 pandemic, only the questionnaire component of the STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) Instrument was used (i.e., actual body measurements and biochemical analysis were not performed).  Arabic is the dominant language in the United Arab Emirates (UAE); thus, the Arabic version of the STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) instrument was adopted in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) setting.",fbf28e20-5a2b-4eae-80a5-22f4ba83a397

Have you ever had a heart attack or chest pain from heart disease (angina) or a stroke (cerebrovascular accident or incident)?  Data related to lifestyle advice and dietary modification given to participants by health care professionals in the STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) instrument were also collected, including advice on quitting smoking, reducing fat intake, increasing intake of fruits and vegetables and maintaining a healthy body weight.  2.2.2.",394e4756-c58c-4442-943a-53aaef9933be
8,methods8," Quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire  A validated web-based quantitative food frequency questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) developed for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) adult population [41] was used to assess dietary intake during the month preceding the interview date. Details of the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) were previously reported [41]. Briefly, the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) is in Arabic and contains 135 food items and 12 food groups that are commonly consumed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE): (1) Dairy foods, (2) Composite dishes, (3) Proteins (including vegetarian and animal sources of proteins), (4) Vegetables (fresh and cooked vegetables including potatoes), (5) Cereals (pasta and other cereals), rice and starches, (6) Sandwiches and baked snacks, (7) Bread and savory biscuits, (8) Spreads on bread, vegetables and salads (excluding use in cooking), (9) Soups, (10) Fruits and dried fruits, (11) Beverages and (12) Sweets and other snacks.",3926062f-2e64-4148-9167-55a732d79832
9,methods9,  The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) contains culturally specific food images depicting the range of distribution of intake among Emirati adults. The food images are presented in a series of three digital food photographs [33]. The food frequency questionnaire contains nine response options: (1) Never or less than once per month; (2) one to two times per month; (3) three times per month; (4) once per week; (5) two times per week; (6) three to four times per week; (7) five to six times per week; (7) Once per day; (8) two times per day; and (9) three times per day.  The daily energy and nutrient intakes of the surveyed participants were calculated from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Macronutrients with established recommended dietary intakes were further examined by generating categorical variables based on those values and the percentage of the population above the recommended levels of saturated fat and cholesterol or below for fiber.,d3fd2060-da1d-47ed-91f0-9522bd764a05
10,methods10," The database used in the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) for the calculation of energy and nutrients intake has been previously reported [42].  2.3. Assessment Adherence to Mediterranean Diet  Data from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) was used to examine participants’ adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) using the Composite Mediterranean score (c-MEDS). In the calculation of the c-MEDS, eight food groups used in a previous United Arab Emirates (UAE) study to determine adherence to the MD [34] were considered: whole grains, refined grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, fish, sweetened beverages and olive-oil-to-saturated fat ratio. The c-MEDS was assessed by assigning a score of 1 for consuming equal to or above the median intake of the specific food group and a score of zero for consuming below the median intake [33]. Sugar-sweetened beverages and refined grains were reverse coded.",3e165bf7-8c3f-423d-aa19-13afd02761be
11,methods11,"  The sum of the scores of the eight food groups was used to calculate the c-MEDS with a maximum possible score of 8 with higher scores indicating better adherence to the MD. Based on the c-MEDS calculation, participants were categorized either into the “high” or “low adherence” group. Individuals with a c-MEDS below the median score of the population were categorized as a “low adherence” group and those with a c-MEDS equal to or above the median intake of the population were categorized as a “high adherence” group. In addition, intake of eight c-MED food groups of the participants with dyslipidemia and those without were compared.  Food groups were analyzed either as daily or weekly intake. Vegetables, fruit and 100% fruit juice, whole grains and refined grains were calculated as daily intake. Legumes/pulses, fish and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and the ratio olive-oil-to-saturated-fat were calculated based on the weekly consumption.",8ae276b9-cefa-4927-b653-0f34837ec45e

The specific food items considered in each of the food groups are provided as Supplementary Table S1.  2.4. Statistical Analysis  Categorical data were presented in frequencies and percentages (n, %). Continuous data were screened for extreme outliers and potential misclassifications by tabulation techniques and the use of scatter plots. K density and P-P plots were used to examine distribution. Normally distributed variables were summarized using means and standard deviations (sd), whereas the medians and range (25th–75th percentiles, to avoid extreme variables) were used for skewed data. Student’s t-test (for normally distributed) or the Mann–Whitney U test (for skewed data) tests was employed to examine significant differences between continuous variables.",11870c34-6348-4389-bd60-a716df734b2f
13,methods13," The Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test (for small sub-samples; n < 5) was used to examine significant group differences between categorical variables.  Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and age group, gender, nationality, educational level, employment status, marital status, physical activity level, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), hypertension diagnosis, diabetes diagnosis and history of cardiovascular disease. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata, version 16.1 [43]; p-values < 0.05 were considered to be significant.  3. Results  3.1.

There was a significant difference in the body mass index (BMI) between participants with and those without dyslipidemia (p = 0.002). A total of 72% percent of participants with dyslipidemia were overweight/obese, while 51.2% of participants without were overweight/obese. Moreover, a larger proportion of participants without dyslipidemia were of normal body mass index (BMI) compared to those with dyslipidemia (43.6% vs. 26.7%). Surveyed participants with dyslipidemia reported a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension (40% vs. 10.8%), diabetes (17.3% vs. 4.5%) and history of cardiovascular disease (12% vs. 1.5%) compared to those without dyslipidemia.  3.2.",d5f29599-522f-48d8-9bc2-4287b2b7cee2

Of the 610 participants, 319 (52.3%) had their blood cholesterol checked in their lifetime, and out of those, 75 (23.5%) reported that they were diagnosed with high blood cholesterol. Of those treated, 38.7% received medical treatment for dyslipidemia, and 20% were taking herbal/traditional remedies.  3.3. Energy and Nutrient Intakes  Table 3 shows an intake comparison of energy and macronutrients of the surveyed participants with and without dyslipidemia. There was no significant difference in energy intake between participants with and without dyslipidemia (2202.9 kcal and 2247.8 kcal/day, respectively).

The median composite MED score (c-MEDS) was 4 with a range between 0 and 8. According to the bivariate (or crude) analysis, age group, nationality, marital status, educational level, smoking status and self-reported diagnosis of dyslipidemia or hypertension were significantly associated with higher adherence to the MD diet.  More specifically, the older the participants were, the higher the likelihood of participants having a higher MD adherence score compared to younger adults (31–49-year old’s: OR: 1.87; 95%CI: 1.26–2.77 and those aged 50+: OR: 4.16; 95%CI: 2.59–6.69 compared to 18–30 years old adults).",94b42c93-d355-457e-b9aa-dd550f7c5e7b

In terms of nationality, non-Emirati women were 46% more likely to have high adherence to the MD diet compared to non-Emirati. The likelihood further increased (OR: 1.95; 95%CI: 1.33–2.87) when the model was adjusted for all other factors related to MD. Furthermore, participants who were married or divorced/widowed were also more likely to have a higher MD score compared to single (OR: 2.37; 95%CI: 1.69–3.33 and OR: 2.63; 95%CI: 1.13–6.15, respectively); however, the effect was nulled in the fully adjusted model.

Discussion  Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease [44]. A dyslipidemia prevalence of 72.5% among the adult Emirati adults with a mean age of 42.8 years was reported [18], which is greater than the global incidence of 39% [1]. Diet and obesity are modifiable risk factors for dyslipidemia.",370b4809-4644-4342-a9d4-30f044537bbd
22,methods22," Due to the limited studies on dietary patterns and dyslipidemia in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), we examined the associations of dyslipidemia with dietary intakes, body weight status and sociodemographic factors in a sample of adults in the United Arab Emirates.  The prevalence of dyslipidemia among participants in the present study who reported that they had their blood cholesterol measured in their lifetime (n = 319) was 23.5%, which is much lower than a prevalence of 72.5% reported in a previous United Arab Emirates (UAE) study [18]. Possible reasons for this difference include the younger age of participants in the present compared to the previous survey (34.5 vs. 42.8 years, respectively) [18]. In addition, the present study relied on a self-reported diagnosis of dyslipidemia rather than the biochemical assessments as in the previous study [18].",354763cc-2eb8-47dc-8038-9885b3c573b7
23,methods23,"  Gender, smoking, age, central obesity and diabetes were the significant predictors of dyslipidemia in the previous study [18], while in the present study, gender was not associated with dyslipidemia. Another study conducted in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) involving 5126 young adults, aged 18–40 years found a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia among men compared to women [19]. However, in the above-mentioned two studies, there was a higher proportion of males (51.8% and 62%, respectively) compared to the current study, which involved predominately female participants (64.3%).  Mezhal and colleagues [19] also reported the coexistence of obesity and dyslipidemia with other cardiometabolic risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes. In the present study, reported dyslipidemia diagnosis was associated with increased age, higher body mass index (BMI) and a history of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.",0cd51127-c2a4-4f87-bed1-5957dbe1bf97
24,methods24," The link between obesity and dyslipidemia is well-established [11,44].  Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is associated with dyslipidemia [45,46]. Among Chinese adults, older age, overweight and obesity were associated with dyslipidemia [45]. Several studies conducted in Saudi Arabia found an association between dyslipidemia with obesity and sociodemographic factors, including high waist circumference, higher body mass index (BMI) and age, within both genders [36] as well as increasing age, male gender and body mass index (BMI) [47].  The United Arab Emirates has undergone major economic changes and urbanization over the past five decades, which is accompanied by nutritional transition changes from the traditional diet to diets higher in fat, sugar and meats and lower in whole grains, fruits and vegetables [7]. This eating pattern is reflected in the results obtained from the dietary intakes of the participants in the current study.",d5663efa-e288-402e-8a13-6dc0397ea031
25,methods25," For example, over 80% of participants with dyslipidemia and those without had a saturated fat intake greater than 10% of their daily total calories, over 70% had dietary cholesterol greater than 200 mg/day, and 61% of them did not meet the dietary fiber recommendation of at least 25 g/day [48].  An analysis of the consumption of food groups in the composite Mediterranean Diet in the present study showed a higher consumption of vegetables among participants previously diagnosed with dyslipidemia. This may be as a result of the advice of increasing vegetable intake received after the diagnosis of dyslipidemia. On the other hand, participants without a diagnosis of dyslipidemia reported consumption of refined grains and sugar-sweetened beverages. It is possible that participants with dyslipidemia adapted healthier dietary habits after the diagnosis by reducing the intake of refined grains and sugar-sweetened beverages.",7070bd70-6f16-4b7e-b952-b496267a85ae
26,methods26,"  In a study by Enani and colleagues, carbonated beverages were associated with an elevated risk of dyslipidemia in males [36]. Among Kuwaiti adults, the risk of metabolic syndrome or dyslipidemia was higher in individuals who adhered more closely to the poultry/refined grains diet pattern than in those who adhered the least [37]. On the other hand, the consumption of a diet high in vegetables was linked to a reduced incidence of dyslipidemia but not the cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk variables [37].  Research has confirmed the multiple benefits of healthy dietary patterns, including the Mediterranean diet (MD) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) Diet, on their protective role against cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [26,49,50,51,52], and these should be recommended for dyslipidemia prevention and management [44].",03b0f8b5-a200-4e8b-8845-5c468d9a9329
27,methods27," In addition to the health benefits, healthy dietary patterns, such as the MD and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, are higher in plant-based foods and lower in animal-based foods supporting environmental sustainability [28,53]. An analysis of data from a representative sample of Emirati adult women showed that the MD supports environmental sustainability [33].  The current study examined the sociodemographic factors associated with adherence to the MD among the participants. After adjusting for covariates, such as age, gender, nationality, educational level, physical activity level, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), self-reported diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease, the adherence to MD was low (Mediterranean Diet composite Score of 4 out of 8),",669fdd11-13a6-4ecd-9a61-3329bfb1de14
28,methods28," Our findings are consistent with the results of a previous study involving adult Emirati women aged 19–50 years [33] as well as study conducted in United Arab Emirates (UAE) during the COVID_19 lockdown [32]. Moreover, the results showed higher adherence to the MD among older participants.  Similarly, a study conducted in Kuwait found that older adults had higher adherence to the vegetable-rich dietary pattern while younger adults had higher adherence to the fast-food or refined-grains/poultry dietary patterns [37]. A study conducted in Southern Italy and Malta also showed higher adherence to MD among older participants [54,55]. We also found that non-Emirati participants had higher adherence to the MD compared to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) nationals. This might be because most of the non-Emirati participants were originally from countries in the Middle East, such as Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, that traditionally follow the MD.",d655647a-8d7f-4d38-9a14-8887054677aa
29,methods29,"  The findings of the current study highlight the need to develop intervention programs promoting the adoption of dietary choices, which are consistent with cardiovascular health-promoting dietary patterns, such as the MD [29,50] and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [26,52]. These programs should specifically target younger adults, since based on the present study they were less adherent to MD compared to those who were older. In a recent study involving university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), only 28.7% and 34% reported eating fruits and vegetables daily, respectively [56].  Educational initiatives targeting the prevention of obesity through public awareness and other initiatives are needed to mitigate dyslipidemia and associated cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).",257351fc-ca5d-4c51-914c-340ae8e2cd32
30,methods30," Moreover, screening for dyslipidemia in young adults could be considered a promising strategy for reduction in risk factors and cardiovascular diseases (CVD)s. A recent study conducted in the found a high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors among adults aged 18–40 years [19].  The results from the present study found that 20% of those diagnosed with high cholesterol reported taking herbal/traditional remedies. In a previous study conducted in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 39.3% of participants with diabetes reported using complementary and alternative medicine (complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)) since diagnosis [57]. Some of the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) used by the surveyed participants included herbs, vitamins and mineral supplements [57]. Therefore, there is a need to increase awareness of the safety of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among patients with chronic diseases.",dc0357a5-165f-47c9-8975-a4e2f731d462
31,methods31,"  There is a need for public awareness and policies that facilitate the consumption of health-promoting dietary patterns. Greater efforts should be placed to access of affordable healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Higher food prices, such as fruits and vegetables were identified to be a barrier to adherence to the MD in other countries [58,59].  A range of interventions at different levels, including accessible and affordable healthy foods, have a more promising approach to reducing the prevalence of obesity and other risk factors of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). These interventions should combine individual-level behavioral interventions with changes in the food environment in and the cultural context of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) society. Moreover, early identification and management of dyslipidemia and other risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) at an earlier age are needed. In the present study, only 52.",f6a2f2e8-74d4-4e67-9f68-57c42de02373

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the dietary patterns of adults in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) diagnosed with dyslipidemia using a country-specific food frequency questionnaire. Furthermore, this study included both Emirati nationals and expatriate residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Finally, the use of the World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) Instrument, which is a valid tool for collecting population-level data on risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [31] is another strength of the study. However, there are several limitations of this study. The cross-sectional nature of the study limits the causality.",72452634-1d23-44d6-bfaf-fe2491ffef1a
33,methods33," Another potential limitation is a recall bias related to the self-reported dietary intake and the diagnosis related to dyslipidemia and other chronic diseases.  Moreover, since the survey was conducted online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, actual body measurements and biochemical measurements were not collected. Future studies that include the other components of the STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) Instruments, such as physical measurements (blood pressure, weight, height and waist circumference) and biochemical measurements (blood glucose and blood lipid profile) are needed. Finally, data used for this study involved only the three main emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE); thus, national-level data from a representative sample of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) population is needed.  5.",1507c12a-19f2-4c5e-b2a1-cbcd6fa57366
34,methods34," Conclusions  In this study, we evaluated the diet and other risk factors associated with dyslipidemia in a sample of adults from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has a high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The results showed that the food choices of adults in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who were with and without dyslipidemia were not consistent with health-promoting dietary patterns, such as the MD. Interventions that combine individual-level behavioral changes with adjustments in the food environment and within the cultural context of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) society are needed.
