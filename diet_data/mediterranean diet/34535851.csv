0,methods0," 2.1. Design, Setting and Participants  Atrial Fibrillation in High-Risk Individuals (Atrial Fibrillation in High Risk Individuals (AFHRI)) is a prospective, monocentric clinical cohort study to improve the prediction of personal risk for AF, conducted at the University Heart and Vascular Center, Hamburg. Between October 2019 and March 2020, we recruited a sub-sample of AF patients from the Atrial Fibrillation in High Risk Individuals (AFHRI) cohort (Atrial Fibrillation in High Risk Individuals (AFHRI)-C). It was ensured that the selected AF patients had a limited risk-factor burden, in particular no prevalent cardiovascular disease, thyroid dysfunction, or cancer.",1c3c65bf-e6d7-4443-9bf1-e4601f819ad3
1,methods1," Because the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) often interacts with metabolic risk factors including hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus [19], we expected that the sub-sample of the study population with limited risk-factor burden would allow insight into isolated influences of lifestyle and diet on risk of arterial prolapse. The sub-sample was matched to controls based on age, gender, and risk factor (matching criteria), selected from the Hamburg City Health Study (Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS)), a prospective, long-term, population-based cohort study, conducted at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf [38]. In total, 153 participants were enrolled—68 AF patients and 85 matched controls. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was obtained.  2.2.",63afbede-667b-4508-a4b2-23139ae8dfa3
2,methods2," Variables, Measurements and Processes  Questionnaire data and peripheral venous blood were acquired on the day of enrolment. The participants’ characteristics were collected through a questionnaire administered by a healthcare professional, and from patient files. Variables of the present analysis included gender, age, height, prevalent diseases, medication including vitamin K antagonists, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as alcohol consumption, current and former smoking status, physical activity, dietary intake, dietary changes within the year prior to examination, as well as income (Table S1). Income was deliberately chosen over other socio-economic variables since it is associated with education as well as improved food choice and quality, hence was more relevant to the study [39]. Quality of patients’ medical data was controlled via information from patients’ medical records.",1bc0f0ce-3785-4c1c-b057-5528cd6af661
3,methods3," To measure physical activity, we used the validated seven-item International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (IPAQ-SF) [40] and calculated metabolic equivalents (metabolic equivalents (MET)) of physical activity. Resting heart rate (beats per minute) was measured after 5 min in sitting position, with a 12-channel ECG (Schiller® CARDIOVIT AT-10 plus). Blood samples were taken and NT-proBNP (pg/mL) was determined as an AF-related blood marker (Elecsys® proBNP II, Roche). Patient weight was measured with a calibrated mechanical column scale (Seca 709). The body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was defined as body weight in kg/body height in m2. Underweight was defined as body mass index (BMI) up to 18.5 kg/m2, normal weight as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18.5 kg/m2 up to 25 kg/m2, overweight as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 up to 30 kg/m2, and obesity as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2.",d1d1dab4-899a-4bae-980b-baeab4002000
4,methods4,"  To assess nutrition, the participants were asked to complete a three-day dietary record before their first study participation appointment. To improve data quality, we used a standardised procedure during data collection with precise questions administered by only one study nurse. The food data was analysed in terms of energy and nutrient intake and the adherence to the dietary patterns of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)), and the Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)) was derived from patients’ food intake (Tables S2 and S3). The 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) includes the frequency of food consumption (olive oil, vegetables, fruits, red meat, animal fats, carbonated drinks, red wine, fish/seafood, legumes, nuts, commercial foods, and traditional Mediterranean dishes with tomato sauce) as well as the preferred cooking fat and meat consumed [34].",a9a3fe52-7e36-4995-96b0-a1ac1350d1c5
5,methods5," Each item was scored zero or one depending on whether the item-specific criteria were met, resulting in a scores between 0 and 14. Since different versions of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) are available, we decided to use the edition validated in German, which appeared to be suitable for the high-quality nutritional assessment in Germany [41]. Based on food protocols, this German version of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores five food groups from 0 to 10 (cereal and potato; dairy; meat, sausage, fish, and egg; fat or oil; sweets and foods high in fat) and three food groups from 0–20 (vegetables; fruits; beverages), allowing total scores between 0 and 110 points. Information on how food portions were converted into score points is included in the Supplementary Data. For the evaluation of the nutrition data, the Software Ebispro 2011 (Stuttgart, Germany) was used, which includes 15,000 foods (food items) based on the German food composition database BLS version 3.",4734d1c1-d2cc-4b93-a6aa-59e531766202

Data Handling  The variables were tested using Shapiro–Wilk tests for normal distribution and visualisations such as scatter plots and box plots for outliers. metabolic equivalents (MET) and NT-proBNP showed strong positive skew in their distribution and therefore variables were transformed by applying common logarithms to base 10 as appropriate [42]. After checking whether missing values were distributed randomly, using Little’s MCAR Test (chi2 (67) = 72.91, p = 0.290), we performed a multiple data imputation with five imputations [43] and aggregated these into a pooled value using the Bar procedure [44]. Missing values were imputed for income (15), resting heart rate (12), NT-proBNP (8), and weight (2). To explore the impact of the imputation on our results, we ran our models several times excluding once each variable with imputed data. However, we were not able to detect differences of relevance.",0e669e24-df16-4d95-bea8-9423a944f4bc

Participants and Matching  Before matching patients and controls, 17 participants were excluded. Reasons for study exclusion were noncompleted or poorly completed dietary protocols, major dietary changes within the past year, incomplete records on pre-existing arterial hypertension, and intake of vitamin K antagonists. Matching was based on gender, pre-existing arterial hypertension, and a maximum age difference of eight years. For the statistical analysis, 104 participants remained, 52 patients and 52 controls (Figure 1). In a pre-post comparison for matching, no significant differences were found in the descriptive statistics of key variables used for modelling (Table S7).  2.5.",991dc6e9-e230-41e0-9bb9-22e4cfe42e2c
8,methods8," Statistical Analysis  Categorical variables of participant characteristics are presented by their absolute and relative frequencies, and Pearson’s chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used to determine subgroup comparisons. Shapiro–Wilk tests indicated that most of the continuous variables significantly varied from normal distribution. Therefore, continuous variables are reported as the median and the first and third quartiles. Non-parametric tests for group comparisons (Mann–Whitney U tests), and correlations of variables (Spearman’s rho) were applied. The size of each significant correlation coefficient was interpreted according to rule of thumb (negligible: R < 0.3, low: 0.3 < R < 0.5, moderate: 0.5 < R < 0.7, high: 0.7 < R < 0.9, very high: 0.9 < R < 1.0) [45].",d335a8e5-679a-4146-9b35-593b52bc6b21
9,methods9," To analyse the association of the nutrition scores with the presence of atrial fibrillation, we performed binary logistic regression analysis in two different models for Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI). Independent variables which correlated (R > 0.3) with Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) or with each other were excluded from both models to avoid effects of multicollinearity. The crude model equals a Pearson correlation (unadjusted). Model 1 was adjusted for income, resting heart rate, log metabolic equivalents (MET), energy intake, and dietary changes over the past year. Model 2 for both nutrition scores was adjusted for the variables of Model 1 and additionally for log NT-proBNP. All possible confounders were tested for significance within the model.",2e3c1beb-d9ef-41fb-9bab-3243df5d2351
10,methods10," To make comparable the results of the binary logistic regressions for the two dietary patterns, the maximum Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score was scaled down to the maximum Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score, from 110 to 14. Thus, a one-point increase in the model was equivalent to a one-point increase in Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and a 11014≈ 7.86-point increase in the Healthy Eating Index (HEI). Matching variables (gender [±0], age [±8 years], hypertension [±0]) as well as closely related variables (e.g., smoking status) were not taken into account for modelling, as the matching procedure aimed to eliminate the effects of these variables. Wald tests were applied to determine whether odds ratios (OR) differed from 1. Results of the regressions are presented as ORs and their 95% lower and upper confidence intervals (CI). Nagelkerke’s R2 was used to describe the regression model’s fit. The significance level was set to a < 0.05.",db343b2d-d3d9-45af-9b09-d77f83f57118

Characteristics of Study Participants  We included N = 104 participants in this analysis; 52 patients with AF but limited risk-factor burden and 52 controls. Based on the matching procedure, the groups were equal in their proportion of men (73.1%). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in age, income, prevalence of diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, and peripheral arterial disease, or for reported partial dietary changes within the past 12 months. Clinical parameters such as body mass index (z = 3.32, p = 0.001), log NT-proBNP (z = 5.61, p < 0.001), and resting heart rate (z = 2.33, p = 0.020) were significantly lower for the control group compared to the patient group.",827bb5b4-fa12-446c-95dc-7348a072f3c0

More detailed information on study participants is provided in Table 1.  3.2. Group Differences in Dietary Patterns  For Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), significant differences were found in two out of fourteen food groups. The control group scored significantly higher for the food group nuts (z = 7.80, p = 0.010) and for the preference of white meat over red meat (z = 6.37, p = 0.021), compared with AF patients. No study participant consumed four or more servings of olive or rapeseed oil per day. The adherence to Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) of the diets was low overall, and the median Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score was three out of fourteen points.",84a3b102-64cd-4f76-859c-77851c872a52
13,methods13," For Healthy Eating Index (HEI), statistical analysis revealed that the control group scored significantly higher in the vegetable (z = 2.66, p = 0.008) and fruit (z = 2.70, p = 0.007) food groups. Similar results applied for beverages (z = 1.79, p = 0.074) and dairy (z = 1.84, p = 0.066), for which the p-value was bordering significance. The control group scored significantly higher for both Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) (z = 2.47, p = 0.014) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) (z = 2.93, p = 0.003). The dietary patterns of patients and controls according to Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.  3.3. Correlation Analysis  Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) showed a low positive correlation with each other (r = 0.322, p = 0.001), and each correlated negatively with the presence of AF (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS): r = −0.243, p = 0.",0972cc6f-4779-4af1-a427-b5ad5c5d7818

Healthy Eating Index (HEI) also correlated positively with age (r = 0.217, p = 0.027) and total energy intake (r = 0.198, p = 0.044). However, most of these effects were negligible for the model calculation. An overview of all correlations can be found in Table 2.  3.4. Association of Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) with the Presence of AF  The results of the logistic regressions in Figure 4 and Figure 5 demonstrate that Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) (OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.60–0.97, p = 0.025) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) (OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.44–0.86, p = 0.",5331bd39-4e79-4c92-a40c-322dc28cfb44

This association remained significant in Model 1 after adjustment for income, resting heart rate, log metabolic equivalents (MET), energy intake, and dietary changes over the past year (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS): OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.51–0.89, p = 0.006; Healthy Eating Index (HEI): OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.46–0.94, p = 0.023), and for Model 2 after additional adjustment for log NT-proBNP (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS): OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.47–0.91, p = 0.011; Healthy Eating Index (HEI): OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.39–0.95, p = 0.027). Model 2 is to be preferred over Model 1, as it included an additional important independent variable: log NT-proBNP.

Discussion  To our knowledge, this matched case–control study among AF patients with limited risk-factor burden was the first to account for potential confounders before investigating dietary patterns and their relationship to the presence of AF and known AF risk factors.",dfba24d8-1b08-4436-9b1f-d1cd9de27219
17,methods17," Our findings indicate that (a) the dietary patterns of patients with prevalent AF were poorer than those of age-, gender- and risk factor-matched control individuals, both in terms of adherence to individual foods such as nuts, vegetables and fruits, and to Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) overall; (b) Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) both correlated with AF-related risk factors such as body mass index (BMI) and resting heart rate in patients with AF; (c) the adherence to healthy dietary patterns measured by both Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was independently negatively associated with the presence of AF, even after adjustments; and (d) inclusion of NT-proBNP as a typical blood biomarker for AF remains significant.  Lifestyle and nutrition have already been shown to be influencing factors for a multitude of cardiovascular conditions [19].",dc395411-810a-4938-ac5f-12b2cf8c5b55
18,methods18," Additionally, the incidence and prevalence of AF is increasing in ageing societies [4]. According to the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology, in addition to age, about 50% of the known risk factors for AF are associated with lifestyle, leading to diseases such as diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, obesity, and early coronary heart diseases [21]. Consequently, lifestyle changes are recommended, including reduction of weight, lower alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation, as well as increased regular exercise. Although individual aspects of nutrition have been examined in relation to AF, e.g., caffeine intake [25,26,27] or fish consumption [28], little evidence overall exists to complete the complex nutritional picture. No specific dietary recommendations can be found in guidelines for AF.",9b222c0d-a80a-443b-a56f-3160cced0582
19,methods19," Initial studies have indicated that the Mediterranean diet [17,24] or a plant-based diet [23] may be beneficial in preventing or even reversing the development of AF, so we analysed associations of dietary patterns as measured by Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), which incorporates several of the above factors. The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) evaluation not only revealed that the group of AF patients performed significantly less well compared to the controls, but also an independent inverse relationship between adherence to healthy dietary patterns, assessed by Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), and the presence of AF. Differences for single items were found in the categories “nuts” and “preference for white meat over red meat”, where the AF patients had significantly less beneficial intake.",2a099f4b-815f-4eb9-ab30-30ea9931df17
20,methods20," In comparison to previous analysis carried out by Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS), adherence to Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) was slightly lower in our study sample (M = 2.88 vs. M = 4.54 out of 14) which can be attributed to differences in the survey instruments as well as data derivation [46]. Overall, both groups in our study showed low adherence to Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), suggesting that the Mediterranean diet is only reflected to a small degree in the dietary patterns of the German population [47]. However, since a rather low adherence to the Mediterranean diet was to be expected, we analysed an additional nutrition construct, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), which had been developed in an international setting for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and adapted according to German dietary guidelines. The latter is reflected in our descriptive results for Healthy Eating Index (HEI) in the control group (Median = 56.",200f314f-f0f8-4110-ae82-8a7dd0bff876
21,methods21,"5), which were similar to the German population average found by von Rüsten et al. (Mmen = 54.9, Mwomen = 59.8) [41]. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was therefore a suitable tool for our study with German participants. Although we additionally used dietary patterns adapted to German eating habits, our AF patients still scored significantly less well compared with the controls, particularly for the food groups “fruits” and “vegetables” as well as overall (Med = 51.7). The results for Healthy Eating Index (HEI) were similar to those for Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). It was found that the odds of the presence of AF decreased by 40% (95% CI 5%–61%) with a 7.86-unit increase in Healthy Eating Index (HEI). Hence, the results of both dietary scores pointed in the same direction and, unsurprisingly, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) showed a correlation to each other.",8e3312a7-5371-45a2-bec4-35fe8e0aec62
22,methods22," Although the indices share some identical items, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) differ fundamentally in scoring, number and composition of items, and targeted population. This is because the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) has fixed cut-off values for scoring, which may allow group differences to remain undetected that are revealed in Healthy Eating Index (HEI). From a critical point of view, both dietary indices seem less than ideal for the study participants examined, so development of an index that provides a more accurate classification of food groups could lead to even better results. In particular, the food groups “meat, sausage, fish, egg” and “fat, oil” in the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) require improved classification to be used in the investigation of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and AF.",d01ddccd-dd6e-49df-9201-28451c7e82ea
23,methods23," An analysis of six prospective cohort studies found that a higher intake of different types of meat, but not fish, was significantly associated with a small increase in the risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) [48]. Furthermore, in a randomised trial, butter and olive oil were associated with opposite effects on blood lipid levels [49], which are an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [19]. Based on these findings, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index [50], which showed a strong inverse association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a prospective cohort study, could be usefully applied in the study of AF. However, the low to mediocre adherence to the survey instruments used also raises the question of whether poor adherence is due to the surveys’ failures to reflect accurately the dietary habits of the German population and the degree to which the German population lacks a healthy diet in general.",0af483ae-9cb3-4e6c-99d4-ce5e7255b30d
24,methods24," Regardless, our cross-sectional results indicated that Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) were associated with AF-related risk factors, such as body mass index (BMI) [51] and resting heart rate [52], and with the presence of AF in patients with limited risk-factor burden. Therefore, more in-depth investigation is required, applying a study design with higher evidence levels, such as prospective intervention studies.  Strengths and Limitations  Certain limitations of this study should be mentioned. First, due to the small sample size, it is possible that group differences in dietary patterns remained undetected. Second, the present study followed a case–control design and thus precluded any causal interpretations. Third, our calculations were not adjusted for multiple testing, which leaves the possibility of undetected α-error.",956d1a4d-bfe2-4567-9133-48f01bb1c6e9
25,methods25," Finally, there is evidence that additional factors such as emotional distress and obstructive sleep apnoea are associated with AF [21], and these could have been considered as potential confounders.  Our study has several strengths, in particular its methodological approach. We focussed on minimising confounding factors at all times during the study. For example, suitable participants for study inclusion were carefully selected from the cohort, one nurse exclusively conducted food questionnaires, and the collected data quality was controlled by a nutritionist. Participants who reported having changed their dietary patterns within the last year, had poorly completed dietary records, or took vitamin K antagonists were excluded from the analysis. Matching was based on age, gender and risk factors. All requirements were checked before multivariate analysis, and the model was appropriately adjusted.",0f56d947-2d99-42b9-8e23-5ddc9eebefbd
26,methods26," A special feature of our evaluation was that we extracted data for both Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) from the patients’ dietary records, which allowed a deeper understanding of the data and indices.  5. Conclusions  In ageing populations, AF is of high public health relevance, yet there is little evidence on the importance of dietary patterns. We were able to show that adherence to the Mediterranean diet, and especially the intake of plant-based foods such as nuts, vegetables, and fruits, and also preference for white meat over red meat, was less frequently reported by AF patients. Larger clinical studies are required to confirm the extent to which high quality dietary patterns such as a Mediterranean diet are able to influence the onset of AF, in order to provide dietary recommendations for preventive nutrition counselling.",84005191-9b47-47d7-8994-ebc5973c9ebf
27,methods27," Beyond this, the development of a disease-specific nutritional assessment score is desirable to offer an opportunity to enhance secondary prevention in AF, as it could be used for taking medical histories by physicians and for the empowerment of affected individuals.
