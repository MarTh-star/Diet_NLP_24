0,methods0," 2.1. Data Acquisition and Inclusion Criteria  The 16S rRNA gene datasets included in the meta-analysis are publicly available and were identified through a literature search in NCBI PubMed [40] and in the Sequence Read Archive [41]. Search terms were “gut microbiota” or “16s” together with one of the following: “colitis”, “inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)”, “Crohn’s disease”, “colorectal cancer”, “colon cancer”, “colon adenoma”, “adenoma”, “colon polyp”, “Mediterranean diet”, “Western diet”, “Westernized diet”, “paleolithic diet”, “fodmap”, and “ketogenic diet”. The search was limited to articles published from January 2008 to July 2020. When the study did not include a public availability statement, the corresponding author was contacted to ask for access to the data, but we did not include any studies that required additional ethics committee approvals or authorizations for access (e.g., controlled dbGaP studies).",ad3192b9-471a-4d56-bed6-f5289de8537d
1,methods1," Inclusion criteria for all included datasets were as follows:Cross-sectional studies or dietary interventions with MD, PD, or WD, or case-control studies of intestinal diseases such as colorectal cancer (colorectal cancer (CRC)), colon adenoma (CA), colon polyposis (CP), ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn’s disease (CD). May include or not healthy subjects (HC), healthy familiars of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) subjects (FC), or subjects at risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) (RS).  Available 16s rRNA gene sequences derived from human feces with associated quality scores and metadata.  Samples obtained when subjects or patients were not under drug treatments.  Data from at least 10 patients, subjects following a defined diet or healthy subjects with a minimum of 6000 reads each.  2.2. Study Groups  Subjects from the obtained databases were assigned to different groups, defined according to the subject’s dietary pattern and (or) diagnosed gastrointestinal disease.",49f66fee-a159-4ce4-913d-f6f76f7e622c
2,methods2," Either cross-sectional or interventional studies on MD, PD, and WD diets were included in the analysis. Diet composition and the main hallmarks of each diet were obtained directly from the included publications. WD featured a low content of fiber, fruits, and vegetables contrasted by a high consumption of refined carbohydrates and saturated fats [42]. PD was characterized by the consumption of vegetables, fruits, seeds, lean meat, eggs, and fish, the reduction of salt and refined sugars, and the exclusion of grains, pulses, and dairy products [43]. Adherence to MD was defined with validated scores [44,45].  Case-control cross-sectional studies and pre-treatment data from clinical trial reports on colorectal cancer (CRC), CA, CP, UC, and CD were included; guidelines for the diagnosis of all diseases are reported in the corresponding study. HC, FC, and RS subjects were obtained when available in any of the included studies, none of them followed any specific or controlled diet.",c45a4817-a2e5-4eb0-a75b-18746ae6e7af
3,methods3," HC and FC subjects were all healthy, RS subjects were defined as at risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) after colonoscopy, had previous personal or familiar history of colorectal cancer (CRC), or presented obesity (BMI ≥ 30, Table S2). None of the subjects in the HC, FC, or RS groups followed a defined diet. Additional studies [27,46,47,48] were included with the intention of increasing the number of control subjects.  2.3. Data Analysis and Statistics  Raw sequences were processed and analyzed in QIIME 1.9.1 [49]. Sequences were quality filtered with Trimmomatic [50] by truncating when the average quality in a four-base sliding window dropped below Q < 25. Surviving high-quality reads were sorted with 99% similarity into operational taxonomy units (OTUs) with uclust [51] and aligned against the Greengenes 13.8 database with 97% similarity using PyNAST [52,53]. Chimeric sequences were detected with ChimeraSlayer [54] and excluded from downstream analysis.",b63f5114-1c08-49e0-9fad-59f57f9576a5
4,methods4," This stringent processing and analysis resulted in several processed samples not meeting the initial inclusion criteria; therefore, samples with less than 6000 surviving reads and datasets with less than 10 subjects per group were dropped. OTUs with less than 10 reads were also discarded for further analyses.  All data were analyzed together and with the same parameters. Taxonomy assignment was performed with a widely used and trusted reference database covering all included variant regions of the 16s rRNA gene [53]. Sequences that failed to align to the database were not considered. Alpha diversity was assessed using Chao1 metric, total observed OTUs, and the Shannon diversity index. Significance of the test was determined with a non-parametric T-test, and p-values were corrected with the false discovery rate (false discovery rate (FDR)) method (Tables S1 and S2). Only comparisons presenting p < 0.001 were considered significant.",41502aa3-5427-41eb-814d-ce5108c32edf
5,methods5," Beta diversity was estimated using Unifrac distance metrics [55]. Jackknife-supported Principal Coordinates Analyses (PCoA) were performed with QIIME and visualized with Past 4.03 [56] (Figures S3–S6). The significance of PCoA data separation was verified with a permutation test with pseudo-F ratios (function ADONIS) and an analysis of similarities (function ANOSIM) (Tables S3 and S4).  OTU representation was summarized at the phylum, family, and genus levels following the QIIME pipeline (Tables S5–S7); only fully annotated OTUs were considered for analysis. Fold change was calculated in all instances using the abundance of group HC as a reference. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess differentially represented OTUs; p-values were corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) and considered statistically significant when p < 0.01 (Tables S6 and S8). All statistical analyses were performed in QIIME.  3.",8fcb507a-fca8-4298-9be6-ae7f76883b14
6,methods6," Results  A total of 168 clinical or observational studies on diet or gut diseases-associated microbiota, 42 of which included 16S rRNA analysis, were initially identified. Datasets corresponding to 26 studies were available; two of them were discarded, as samples were not sufficiently annotated. Another seven studies did not reach the minimum threshold of 10 samples with at least 6000 quality-checked reads and were discarded.  The remaining 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Included datasets comprised 1931 human fecal samples for a total of 157,425,716 reads; 80.9% of the samples (1563) and 95.7% of reads (150656411) survived the quality check and were used for the analyses. Samples were assigned to eleven different groups (Table 1 and Table S1).  3.1. Alpha and Beta Diversity  Alpha diversity presented no significant differences (p < 0.001) between either diet and disease groups or respect to the HC controls (Figures S1 and S2, Table S3).",c4280ce5-bbab-4fe9-96fc-4d3565621f2d
7,methods7,"  Beta diversity components of groups HC, FC, and RS, observed in PCoA, presented no significant separation. Instead, MD distanced from WD, PD, HC, and RS groups. Likewise, colorectal cancer (CRC) and CA formed separated clusters, which were partially segregated from RS and HC. UC and CD clustered together but remained separated from HC and FC. MD also segregated when confronted to CA, colorectal cancer (CRC), UC, and CD. In all cases, the separation was more evident with unweighted data, which only take into account the presence of OTUs, compared to weighted data, which consider both the presence and abundance of OTUs. (Figure 1, Figures S3–S8, Table S4). These distributions suggest that the microbiota composition of the subjects following MD is different from diseases and controls, and this effect is not shared by the other diets.  3.2.",0c768389-9179-4219-ab59-75b4cc49eb89
8,methods8," Microbiota Composition Analysis  Average proportional composition of all groups by phyla and genera can be found in Figure 2 and Table 2 and Table 3; only significant differences (p < 0.01) were discussed (Tables S5–S7).  Comparison between groups showed that MD-induced microbiota is different from that of the other diets, the controls without a defined dietary pattern (HC), and the RS group (Table 2 and Table 3, Figure 2).  Out of the 12 most abundant phyla, nine were differently represented in MD compared to WD and four were differently represented in MD compared to PD (Table S5). The high data variability of the PD group reduced the significance of its differences with other groups. Still, MD differed from both PD and WD by an increase in Verrucomicrobia (p = 0.0099 and p = 5.6 × 10−6 respectively), and from WD alone by a higher representation of Bacteroidetes (p = 7.9 × 10−7) and lower Firmicutes (p = 0.0002), Euryarchaeota (p = 0.0003) and Fusobacteria (p = 2.",42a31554-eb90-42aa-a1a4-a91c449d2604
9,methods9,"4 × 10−10), among other phyla. MD also presented nine differently represented phyla to RS and FC, and seven to HC, including a lower representation of Fusobacteria (p = 0.0027, p = 0.0051 and p = 0.0002 respectively) and higher of Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria (p < 0.0001 for all).  Among diseases, the colorectal cancer (CRC) group distinguished from CA and CP by a higher presence of Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Euryarchaeota, and Verrucomicrobia (p < 0.0001 for all). The representation of these phyla was also higher in colorectal cancer (CRC) than in HC (Proteobacteria p = 0.005, Fusobacteria p = 0.0051, Euryarchaeota p = 0.005 and Verrucomicrobia p = 0.0082), RS (p < 0.0001 for all). Chronic inflammation-related UC and CD did not present statistically significant differences between them at any taxonomic level (Tables S5–S7); therefore, the two groups were merged for further comparison (inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) group).",3aa082f8-d4f4-4ff4-9406-9830d8372b9e
10,methods10," The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) group presented seven differently represented phyla than HC among the 12 most abundant, but only three to FC, with a higher proportion of Firmicutes (p = 0.0002 and p = 2.5 × 10−5 respectively) and Actinobacteria (p = 0.002 and p = 0.0006) against both, and also higher Fusobacteria (p = 0.002) and lower Verrucomicrobia (p = 0.0002) compared to HC alone. The number of differentially represented phyla among the 12 most abundant in MD compared to CA and colorectal cancer (CRC) was nine and ten respectively, with MD presenting higher Actinobacteria and lower Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria compared to both (p < 0.0001 for all). Differently, MD showed a higher proportion of Verrucomicrobia than CA (p = 3.5 × 10−14) but lower than colorectal cancer (CRC) (p = 7.3 × 10−22). Likewise, compared to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), MD had nine differentially represented phyla, including a higher proportion of Actinobacteria (p = 0.",7fcc80ca-4ec4-4275-83e3-898b5a547ff9
11,methods11,"0001) and Verrucomicrobia (p = 4.9 × 10−5), and lower of Proteobacteria (p = 0.0003) and Fusobacteria (p = 2.6 × 10−12).  Some of the phyla described showed progressive increases or decreases in their relative abundance from subjects in the healthy, at-risk, and cancer-related groups, placing MD furthest from colorectal cancer (CRC) (Figure 3).  The differences observed in some phyla were also present at genus levels. Actinobacteria phylum is composed by several genera differently represented between groups, being the most abundant Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Adlercreutzia, and a non-annotated OTU within family Coriobacteriace (Figure 4). Adlercreutzia was higher in MD with respect to HC, RS, CA, colorectal cancer (CRC), and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (p = 0.0011, p = 0.0024, p = 0.0003, p = 0.0002 and p = 0.007, respectively), while Collinsella was increased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) compared to HC, FC, and MD (p = 1.3 × 10−6, p = 0.0074 and p = 0.",a7a8ec77-ed0b-48e4-8811-891f83c3760c
12,methods12,"0086, respectively). Finally, Bifidobacterium was decreased in colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to HC, RS, and MD (p = 0.0005, p = 2.5 × 10−5 and p = 1.5 × 10−18, respectively).  Analysis of genera also showed differences between groups that were not evident at the family level. The [Ruminococcus] genus from Lachnospiraceae was less represented in MD compared to HC (p = 3.6 × 10−21), FC (p = 1.5 × 10−9), and RS (p = 1.2 × 10−7), while it was increased in both inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (p = 0.0097) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (p = 4.4 × 10−5) against HC. Veillonellaceae is mainly constituted by the genera Dialister, Veillonella, and Phascolarctobacterium, which were the most abundant in MD, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and colorectal cancer (CRC) respectively (Figure 5).  Other phyla such as Verrucomicrobia, Euryarchaeota, and Fusobacteria were prevalently constituted by a single genus: Akkermansia, Methanobrevibacter, and Fusobacterium, respectively (Tables S5–S7).  4.",54ee47c7-6b1a-4dd5-b59c-0806ab36ee2e
13,methods13," Discussion  The Mediterranean diet is widely accepted as part of a healthy lifestyle. Several studies, including those from our meta-analysis, show that the microbiota of MD subjects is enriched in bacteria with beneficial properties that help in maintaining gut barrier function and reducing inflammation. Instead, pathogenic bacteria with pro-inflammatory properties, which can impair the epithelial barrier function and produce toxic metabolites, are poorly represented. The gut microbiota of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), adenoma, and colorectal cancer (CRC) shows an unbalanced bacterial composition that contributes to disease progression. We investigated if the bacterial population induced by MD may have preventive properties against these diseases.  Beta diversity analysis confirmed that microbiota associated to MD was different from that of the disease and control groups, and this was not observed with the other diets.",a7e18ad3-5c7c-4b69-816b-7930ee5ec6e0
14,methods14," Analysis of differently represented OTUs between groups found bacteria with a tendency to increase or decrease along an axis formed by MD–HC–RS–CA–colorectal cancer (CRC) groups. In agreement with the hypothesis of microbiota components accompanying the formation of adenomas and the development of colorectal cancer (CRC), phyla with pro-inflammatory properties such as Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota increased along the axis. A similar trend was also observed for Fusobacteria, which are known to promote colorectal carcinogenesis. In contrast, Actinobacteria, which include short chain fatty acids (SCFA) producers with anti-inflammatory properties, decreased (Figure 3).  The limited number of studies available on PD, WD, and CP resulted in the high variability and lack of statistical significance on these groups, and they did not consistently fit the axis. No statistical difference was found between PD and HC at the phylum level.",d41690e8-fd34-4caa-b325-2f55099d37b4
15,methods15," Instead, WD presented a high variability and may be considered part of the axis in some cases, such as Fusobacteria, but not in others, such as Actinobacteria (Table S5). CP was found many times at similar levels to HC and RS, for example, in Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria. The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) group, made up of subjects obtained from three different studies, had characteristics that could be considered intermediate between HC and colorectal cancer (CRC), because in most cases, it presented abundance levels similar to the first, as in Actinobacteria, or to the latter, as in Fusobacteria.  The Proteobacteria phylum is a marker of gut dysbiosis [68], and one of the phyla increased along the axis. It has been associated with a high-fat diet and obesity in mice [69], with consumption of animal fat [70], and most importantly, with a colonic mucosa more easily penetrated by other bacteria [71].",409a900c-4811-4f78-a3c3-90392a8606c2
16,methods16," This may explain the low abundance observed in MD, where animal fat consumption is greatly diminished, but not in PD, which includes several animal-derived products. Still, Proteobacteria is the most differently represented phyla between MD and PD (p = 8 × 10−5) and coincidently also between MD and HC (p = 2.6 × 10−20) (Table S5). The decrease of Proteobacteria in PD compared to HC was not significant (p = 1). The increasing trend along the axis is found further down at the family level, driven by Enterobacteriaceae, whose enrichment in the gut is favored by inflammation [72]. This family has previously been found increased in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) [73,74] and is a proposed marker of epithelial dysfunction [75]. Other families within Proteobacteria are also decreased in MD compared to controls and diseases, including Sphingomonadaceae and Helicobacteraceae.",a52c7dab-463a-469e-ba89-cee7e7235005
17,methods17," Sphingomonadaceae’s most abundant genus, Sphingomonas, was found increased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients and is associated with CD recurrence [76,77], and it increased in colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) patients as well [78]. The Helicobacteraceae family includes the pathogen Helicobacter pylori, whose prevalence is increased in patients with gastric cancer [79]. This bacterium promotes its pathogenesis by inducing chronic inflammation, accumulation of mutations, and aberrant DNA methylation in the gastric mucosa through the expression of different virulence factors [80,81,82]. It is also found increased in CA and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients [83], and its participation in colorectal cancer (CRC) development has been suggested [84,85].  The most abundant Fusobacteria species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, is a pathogen increased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) [86,87,88].",ed704b4f-ccbc-4ac7-a739-45b7b4736ce0
18,methods18," Fusobacterium suppresses the immune cell response in the gut while also promoting a pro-inflammatory and tumorigenic environment. It produces the virulence factor FadA, which is capable of binding E-cadherin and activating beta-catenin [89], and Fap2, which can inhibit NK and T cell activity [90]. It also recruits several tumor-promoting cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated neutrophils and macrophages [91]. F. nucleatum promotes the destruction of the mucosal barrier by activating the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway [92], and it has been associated with accelerated DNA methylation in the mucosa of UC patients [93]. The low abundance of Fusobacterium in MD may be associated with augmented dietary fiber and reduced fat consumption, as reported by studies on similar dietary patterns [94,95]. The reduction in abundance of a pathogen with such a significant role in cancer is indicative of the potential preventive function of the MD diet.",fd4dfbad-c0fb-45ea-90d8-d83c2c4a92ae
19,methods19," Fusobacteria was also the most significant differently represented phylum between MD and WD (p = 2.4 × 10−10), and its greater representation in the latter when compared to HC may be indicative of a dietary adverse effect.  The only archaea phylum in the meta-analysis, Euryarchaeota, also increased along the MD–HC–RS–CA–colorectal cancer (CRC) axis, except for RS (Figure 3). Euryarchaeota’s main component, Methanobrevibacter smithii, is the dominant archaea species in the human gut, and its abundance correlates with the activation of several pro-inflammatory pathways in multiple sclerosis [96]. It is increased in CA and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients [97] and decreased in obese individuals [98], which may explain the reduction observed in RS, which is a group defined by obesity and other commonly related clinical markers. According to the literature, Methanobrevibacter presented a low abundance in MD subjects [99].",b23ebb9b-519d-4d1d-afbc-c4f80fc408e7
20,methods20," The presence of Methanobrevibacter has been associated with the consumption of dietary fiber [100], but dairy products, which are consumed with moderation in MD, are also possible sources of M. smithii [101]. A similar low representation was found for PD, although the decrease was non-significant compared to HC.  An abundance of Actinobacteria has been associated with the consumption of dietary fiber and production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA)s [102,103]. These anti-inflammatory compounds are a source of energy for epithelial cells and help maintain the stability of the gut barrier [28,104]. Bifidobacterium and Adlercreutzia, two commensals with anti-inflammatory properties that are used as probiotics [105,106], were the most abundant Actinobacteria genera in MD (Figure 4). The most common Adlercreutzia species is A. equolifasciens, which can produce the anti-inflammatory molecule equol [106,107].",e3c09ed5-54c3-4de9-9253-6afe0053e66f
21,methods21," Equol-producing microbiota is found in 59% of vegetarians compared to 25% in non-vegetarians [108]. The increase in vegetables consumption, together with the inclusion of omega 3-rich fat, which has also been related to an increase in Adlercreutzia [109], may explain its abundance in MD. We also found an increase of Actinobacteria in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) subjects compared to FC and HC, confirming previous reports [110], but the increase was driven by the genera Bifidobacterium and Collinsella, and not by Adlercreutzia (Figure 4). Both Collinsella and Adlercreutzia are found in the Coriobacteriaceae family, but the bile-tolerant Collinsella has been linked to pro-inflammatory diseases, obesity, and low fiber consumption [111,112,113]. Another Actinobacteria genus increased in MD was Slackia, which was previously found increased after an intervention with a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet [114], and it includes species such as S. equolifasciens and S.",1c790c48-61fb-4344-9e32-2f6d13f6462d
22,methods22," isoflavoniconvertens, which are capable of producing equol [115,116] but also the opportunistic S. exigua [117]. Actinobacteria phylum was found to be increased in the WD group compared to HC and PD, and indeed, this was the most differently represented phylum between PD and WD, but the increase was not significant compared to MD. At the genus level, WD had the second highest abundance of Collinsella, higher than MD, HC, and even RS, and only below that of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) group.  Another phylum that decreased along the MD–HC–RS–CA–colorectal cancer (CRC) axis is TM7, which is currently known as candidatus Saccharibacteria, as it seems to consume mainly sugars [118], but studies on its potential role and activity are scarce.",2e47e9cd-b11f-4d9a-b598-80675c7e7866
23,methods23," They are obligate epibionts/parasites of other bacteria, and their increase has been reported in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) [119], although the first successfully cultured strain repressed the expression of inflammatory TNF-alpha induced by its host [120]. Unfortunately, the lack of information on this phylum does not offer a possible explanation for its apparent increase in MD subjects.  The low fat and high dietary fiber content typical of MD foster an environment that favors the growth of anti-inflammatory bacteria and hinders that of pro-inflammatory and pathogenic bacteria. This is also evident when MD is compared to HC and highlights its beneficial effect on gut health.  Other phyla that did not follow the axis are also modulated by diet components typical of MD, but differences are observed at lower taxonomic levels.",7f03389f-3840-44f3-9d12-538e0a6553b6
24,methods24," This was the case for families and genera within Firmicutes, including Ruminococcaceae, which had increased in MD and PD compared to all the other groups (Table 3). Several species of butyrate-producing bacteria are found within this family [121], and its abundance in MD and PD is most likely linked to the high consumption of dietary fiber, from which short chain fatty acids (SCFA)s are derived.  Two other Firmicutes families with both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory components, Lachnospiraceae and Veillonellaceae, had differences at the genus level. Lachnospiraceae was lower in the MD group than in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (Figure 5). Regarding the genera included in this family, [Ruminoccocus], it was increased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). These mucolytic bacteria have been found increased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) subjects, and one of its species, R.",c1e73ffd-968a-40bf-b481-858385b0dcce
25,methods25," gnavus, synthesizes a pro-inflammatory polysaccharide [122,123,124]. Instead, butyrate producers with local anti-inflammatory effect, belonging to Roseburia, are depleted in both inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) [125,126,127]. MD and also PD were enriched in genera with anti-inflammatory properties, including Coprococcus, which can produce indole-propionic acid, which is a tryptophan-derived metabolite with antimycobacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities [128,129]. Furthermore, Dorea was increased in MD, while PD was enriched in Lachnospira. Both genera include some short chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing pectin fermenters and are associated with vegetarian and vegan diets [130,131,132], but they have also been reported to increase in obese subjects [133,134]. Blautia is a butyrate producer inversely related to intestinal inflammation [135] but was nevertheless found increased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).",79341722-6224-443f-a8c8-99e59c45ab7e
26,methods26,"  The family Veillonellaceae was increased in MD, colorectal cancer (CRC), and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) compared to HC. The increase in MD was mainly driven by the genus Dialister, in colorectal cancer (CRC) by Phascolarctobacterium, and in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) by Veillonella (Figure 4). Bacteria belonging to these genera are capable of converting succinate and lactate into propionate [136,137,138,139]. Succinate and lactate are metabolites abundant in the tumor microenvironment, have pro-inflammatory properties, and participate in the activation of tumor-associated macrophages [140,141]. Lactate is also found increased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients and correlates with disease severity [142]. Dialister abundance is negatively correlated with total carbohydrates and starch ingestion [143] but is increased by the ingestion of dietary fiber [144,145], which would explain the increase in MD.",2f928fbd-0e97-4c00-9637-fb346cac5267
27,methods27," Importantly, a higher anti-inflammatory response driven by the inclusion of whole grains in the diet was observed in subjects with increased proportions of Dialister [145]. Phascolarctobacterium increased in colorectal cancer (CRC) and decreased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Its abundance has been associated with lower circulating levels of inflammatory markers [146], and the decrease observed in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has already been reported in patients and linked to colon inflammation [147]. An increase in Phascolarctobacterium was reported in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, particularly early-stage patients [148,149], and interestingly, both succinate and lactate are overrepresented in their fecal metabolome [149]. Therefore, its increase in colorectal cancer (CRC) may be related to the augmented succinate and lactate availability and not necessarily to the gut microbiota health or the local inflammation status.",e9942724-b5d1-4cf7-965e-18ee0be13138
28,methods28," The genus Veillonella, which was increased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (Figure 4), includes the species V. parvula, which expresses a lipopolysaccharide with pro-inflammatory activity [150] and induces strong expression of proinflammatory IL6 in vitro, inhibiting the expression of potentially antitumoral IL12p70 induced by other bacteria [151]. Veillonella was also increased and was positively correlated with pro-carcinogenic trimethylamine (TMA)O levels in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients, and it was further increased in Crohn’s patients with deep ulcers [152,153].  The less frequent Veillonellaceae genera Megasphaera, Acidaminococcus, and Mitsuokella are also short chain fatty acids (SCFA) producers [154,155,156]. They all use amino acids as a carbon source and have different affinities for them [157].",0122d1cd-2389-4776-b333-f8da993b733b
29,methods29," This observation could explain the different abundances observed, as vegetable sources (soy, rice), which are increased in MD, have less lysine but more histidine than animal sources (whey) [158]. For example, Megasphaera, which was low in the MD group, grows well in the presence of lysine but not of histidine [157].  Another taxon of interest is the phylum Verrucomicrobia, mainly composed of the genus Akkermansia, which we found increased in MD and decreased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) compared to RS, HC, or FC, but also increased in colorectal cancer (CRC). The presence of this mucolytic bacterium is normally associated with a healthy microbiota [159] and inversely related to inflammation [160]. The increase observed in MD has not been reported before and may be related to the ingestion of fiber, which has been shown to increase mucin expression in animal models [161,162].",7b8f04d3-631c-42bf-823e-e91eed60e712
30,methods30," The decrease in Akkermansia abundance in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) subjects and the increase in colorectal cancer (CRC) had already been reported [122,148,163]. Its high abundance in cancer is probably associated with changes in mucins expression associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, including an upregulation of MUC5AC and downregulation of MUC2 [164], and even the loss of its expression in some patients [165]. Although a direct association between mucin types expression and mucolytic bacteria abundance has not been demonstrated, an increase of Akkermansia has been observed in Muc2-/- mice [166], and in the Winnie mice strain, which produces an aberrant MUC2 [167]. Conversely, Akkermansia is decreased in in vitro culture assays with MUC2 as the sole carbon source, while growth of [Ruminoccocus] species is favored [122].",88520faf-eb5c-44ae-ac87-4ab46fdb828c
31,methods31,"  For the phylum Bacteroidetes, we observed a decrease in the Prevotellaceae family and its main genus Prevotella, in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), CA, and colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to HC and MD. The decrease of Prevotellaceae was previously reported in UC [168] and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients [148]. Some species have pro-inflammatory properties, while others have anti-inflammatory ones [169,170]. No differences were found for Bacteroidaceae, which is another Bacteroidetes family. Bacteroidaceae are mainly composed of the genus Bacteroides and include both benefic and pathogenic species [171].  The observed differences between diets and patient groups suggest that MD may have a potentially beneficial effect on the patient’s microbiota by increasing beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia and Adlercreutzia or the Ruminococcaceae family, reducing at the same time potential pathogenic pro-inflammatory bacteria such as Fusobacterium or Proteobacteria.",8d705513-c41d-49d0-80a3-e203d4dc6d10
32,methods32," Despite the high variability of the data from WD and PD groups, few conclusions could be reached. However, some of the observed effects of WD in microbiota, such as the increases in Fusobacterium and Collinsella, suggest that this diet may be harmful to patient’s health. For PD, we observed few differences that may be considered beneficial, mainly increases in Ruminococaceae, Coprococcus, and Lachnospira. However, these changes alone could hardly suggest a potential benefit or harm. In all cases, further testing would be needed to confirm their potential therapeutic or harmful effect on patients.  Our study presented some limitations stemming from the limited availability of high-quality 16S public data for certain diets or diseases, which made it difficult to balance the number of subjects in each group, as well as their gender or age.",2c918663-14dc-42e4-bb9c-68a4d257a2e7
33,methods33," This also led us to choose to not perform analyses below the genus, due to the greater number of unidentified OTUs at the species level compared to all other taxonomic levels. Furthermore, the data used have provided us with valuable information on the bacterial composition but do not allow evaluating their metabolic activity or evaluating other components of the microbiome such as fungi or viruses.  5. Conclusions  We conducted a meta-analysis of diets and intestinal diseases related to inflammation and cancer that highlights unique characteristics of the bacterial population associated with MD. The microbiota of subjects following MD was enriched with beneficial bacteria that promote an anti-inflammatory environment, which were instead reduced in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), CA, and colorectal cancer (CRC) groups.",a6a3ba6f-1543-4e6d-9e2a-93372acbd1cc
34,methods34," Conversely, taxa with pro-inflammatory properties that can alter the gut barrier functions were reduced in MD and increased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), CA, and colorectal cancer (CRC) groups. Among the modulated taxa, we reported for the first time an increase in Akkermansia and a reduction in Fusobacterium in MD, even below the levels observed in healthy subjects without a defined diet. Akkermansia is a marker of a healthy gut, and Fusobacterium is a known pathogenic bacterium associated with cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Fusobacterium has also a critical role in mediating colorectal cancer (CRC) chemoresistance to oxaliplatin and fluorouracil (5-FU) regimens by activating the autophagy pathway [172]. Our results suggest that MD’s effect on the gut microbiota has the potential to prevent cancer and other inflammation-related diseases of the gut. ",f40c1c97-be4a-4ddf-a555-b0588c15e708
