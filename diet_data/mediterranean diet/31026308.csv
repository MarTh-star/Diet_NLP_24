0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design and Setting The present study represents a cross-sectional, secondary analysis of 122 consecutive women recruited to 4 ongoing studies (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT01859663, NCT01927471, NCT01927432, NCT01785719) between January 2013 and July 2018 that met the inclusion criteria detailed below. Recruitment was completed using paper and electronic advertisements at 3 academic institutions in New York State: (1) Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University (Ithaca); (2) Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Rochester Medical Center (Rochester); and, (3) Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine (New York).  2.2. Ethical Approval  The Institutional Review Boards at Cornell University, University of Rochester, and Weill Cornell Medicine approved the study protocols.",a1a38a68-e2c1-45a6-81ac-1c5b8323c97f
1,methods1," All procedures were conducted in compliance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, and the Guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization on Good Clinical Practice. All participants provided written informed consent.  2.3. Study Participants Women were eligible to participate if they were 18–45 years old and exhibited no signs of perimenopause. Exclusion criteria included: (1) the use of insulin-sensitizing medications within 2 months of study participation; (2) the presence of diabetes mellitus, hyperprolactinemia, untreated thyroid dysfunction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia or premature ovarian failure; and, (3) failure to visualize the ovaries on transvaginal ultrasonography. One hundred and twenty-two women provided complete ultrasonographic and dietary datasets.",27088248-8c20-4b98-a67d-919727a1eac0
2,methods2," Eleven women were excluded from the present analysis due to implausible self-reported energy intakes of 96 and 560 kcal/d (n = 2), poor visualization of ovaries (n = 2), and use of hormonal contraception (n = 7). The final cohort included 111 women.   2.4. Study Procedures  2.4.1. Clinical Assessments A standardized health history and physical examination was performed to obtain demographics, anthropometry, vitals, and family history of chronic disease as described in greater detail previously [53]. Hirsutism was evaluated by visual and self-reported scoring of terminal hair growth on 9 regions of the body [54]. Clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism was defined by a modified hirsutism score ≥6 [55]. Menstrual cycle length was recorded as the self-reported average interval between menstrual cycles in the 12 months before study enrollment. Evidence of oligo-amenorrhea was defined by a self-reported average menstrual cycle length ≥36 days.",3ce3a5ed-7c12-4cd6-848b-7e31fe0dfc25
3,methods3," Further, we determined the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) status of our entire cohort using the recommended thresholds of the 2018 International Evidence-based Guidelines for the Assessment and Management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [55] in compliance with the National Institutes of Health (National Institutes of Health (NIH)) criteria [56] to account for any impact of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) status on outcomes through sub-group analyses.  2.4.2. Biochemical Analyses Fasted blood samples were collected to measure biochemical markers, including insulin, glucose, total testosterone (TT), estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Blood samples were also taken as part of assessing insulin and glucose responses to a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.",76cabae1-116c-4d35-9826-735012b973b2
4,methods4," Blood samples were collected during the early follicular phase in women with regular menstrual cycles or the absence of a dominant follicle (≥10 mm) or corpus luteum in those with irregular or absent menstrual cycles. Serum concentrations of insulin, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL, USA) and glucose by commercial glucometer test strips (Accu-Chek Aviva Plus, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Serum concentrations of TT were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at a clinical chemistry lab participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Hormone Standardization Program (Brigham Research Assay Core, Boston, MA, USA), as previously described [53]. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using the formula: fasting glucose (mg/dL) × fasting insulin (μIU/mL)/405 [57].",9d53c6df-432d-49ed-8350-f9b1ef5861d7
5,methods5," The area under the 2-hr response curves (area under the 2 hr response curves (AUC)) for a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for insulin and glucose was determined using the trapezoidal rule [58,59]. The free androgen index (free androgen index (FAI)) was calculated using the formula: TT (nmol/L)/sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (nmol/L) × 100 [60]. Biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism was defined by a fasting serum TT concentration ≥1.7 nmoL/L or free androgen index (FAI) ≥6; thresholds reflected the 95th percentiles of androgen concentrations in an internal reference cohort. All samples were processed for serum and stored at −80 °C until the time of analyses. All inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were ≤10.5%, consistent with good assay performance.  2.4.3. Ultrasonographic Assessments of Ovarian morphology Transvaginal ultrasound scans were conducted at all study sites using a standardized protocol.",d28fe50c-de44-4919-a1b6-4fb8618a116a
6,methods6," Whole ovaries were scanned from their inner to outer margins in the longitudinal plane using a GE Voluson ultrasound machine (E8, S6, or S8 Series; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with a 5–9 or 6–12 MHz multifrequency transducer. Ultrasound examinations were conducted in the early follicular phase in women with regular menstrual cycles or the absence of a dominant follicle (≥10 mm) or corpus luteum in those with irregular or absent menstrual cycles. Two-dimensional cineloops in the longitudinal plane were archived for offline analysis using DICOM imaging software (Sante DICOM Editor, Santesoft LTD, Athens, Greece). Cineloops were reviewed by 1 of 6 investigators, who had each demonstrated strong inter-rater agreement in follicle counts as part of an internal reliability assessment (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.80). Endpoints of interest were (1) the total number of follicles per ovary (follicle number per ovary (FNPO) 2–9 mm); and, (2) mean ovarian volume (OV).",08d22aea-102f-4d14-9e6c-cc4baf41a5d3
7,methods7," Reliable follicle counts were obtained using the grid system [42]. OV was estimated in the largest cross-section of each ovary using the simplified formula for a prolate ellipsoid [61]. Mean follicle number per single cross-section (follicle number per single cross section (FNPS)) ≥9 was used to identify polycystic ovaries if suboptimal image quality prevented a reliable evaluation of follicle number per ovary (FNPO) and/or OV [41].  2.4.4. Dietary Assessments Food consumption data was collected using VioScreen™ (Version 2.17; VioCare, Inc., Princeton, NJ). VioScreen is an adult-validated, self-administered web-based food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [62]. Vioscreen food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) has been used in both research and clinical settings to assess habitual diet over the past 3 months and uses graphics with approximately 1200 food images and branching questions that reduce missing foods and respondent burden [62,63].",37e326b4-188b-4819-a9aa-1eda26bb5776
8,methods8," Further details about the Vioscreen food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) have been published [64]. Specific nutrient intakes and food data were calculated by processing the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data using the Nutrition Data System for Research software (Version 42; Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA). All women responded to the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in a clinical setting.  Four major a-priori dietary patterns were evaluated in the present study: (1) Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) [65,66,67]; (2) alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (aHEI-2010) [68]; (3) alternate Mediterranean Diet score (aMED) [7]; and, (4) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) [69] based on the dietary information obtained from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). All dietary patterns derived from this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were established a-priori.",cc41603c-db09-4328-a54a-d3a3913d19ac
9,methods9," For each pattern, a higher score represented a healthier diet. The methods of scoring each dietary pattern are summarized below.   Calculation of HEI-2015 was based on the United States Department of Agriculture (United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)) (Washington, DC, USA) and the National Cancer Institute (National Cancer Institute (NCI)), and aligned with the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans [70]. Briefly, the HEI-2015 consists of 13 food items. The first 6 items include (1) total vegetables; (2) total fruits; (3) whole fruits; (4) greens and beans; (5) seafood and plant proteins; and (6) total proteins, which can be scored from 0 to 5 points each. The remaining 7 items include (7) whole grains; (8) low-fat dairy; (9) fatty acids ratio (polyunsaturated fatty acids plus monounsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids); (10) refined grains; (11) sodium; (12) added sugars; and (13) saturated fats, which can be scored from 0 to 10 points each.",f403336a-021e-4524-9ac5-c49d10af7a98
10,methods10," Most food components (except for fatty acids ratio, added sugars, and saturated fats) are scored on a density basis per 1000 kcal or as a percentage of energy. Four components (sodium, refined grains, added sugars, and saturated fats) are reverse scored (i.e., higher intakes receive lower scores). Total HEI-2015 scores were computed by aggregating scores across individual dietary components such that total scores ranged from zero (poor diet quality) to 100 (optimal diet quality) [65,66,71].  The aHEI-2010 index [68] is a modification to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) HEI-2010 dietary pattern index [72] and includes food items thought to influence the risk of chronic disease.",723c2f3d-0cf5-46ca-955c-543718f66981
11,methods11," The aHEI-2010 addresses quality within food groups, has predicted adherence and nonadherence criteria for each food group, and consists of 11 food items, of which, higher intakes are awarded for 6 components: (1) vegetables (excluding potatoes); (2) whole fruits; (3) whole grains; (4) nuts and legumes; (5) long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; (6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (excluding long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids); moderate intake is awarded for (7) alcohol (0.5–1.5 drinks/d for women); and lower intakes are awarded for the 4 remaining components: (8) sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice; (9) red and processed meats; (10) sodium; and, (11) trans fatty acids. Each component intake is scored from 0 to 10. The score for each component was summed. The overall aHEI-2010 scores range from 0 (poor diet quality) to 110 (optimal diet quality) [68].",9a43ffac-9fa0-4a7f-bafe-c64b49bc14e6
12,methods12,"  The aMED score is an adapted version of the traditional Mediterranean Diet score, which demonstrated favorable effects on the risk of chronic disease [73,74,75]. The aMED score was determined based on the intakes of 9 food items: (1) fruits; (2) vegetables (excluding potato); (3) nuts; (4) legumes; (5) whole grains; (6) fish; (7) ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat; (8) red and processed meats; and, (9) alcohol. Those whose intake was above the median for fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fish, or a ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat received 1 point for each category. Consumption of red and processed meat below the median was awarded 1 point, and alcohol intake 5–15 g/d was awarded 1 point; otherwise, zero points were received. The score for each component was summed. The total score range for the aMED was 0 (poor diet quality) to 9 (optimal diet quality) [7].",6d853022-ce10-44ab-8a8e-8f4fab067fbc
13,methods13,"  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was developed based on emphasized or minimized foods, nutrients, and beverages typically consumed in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which has been shown to reduce the risk of blood pressure in previous randomized controlled trials [76,77]. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score consists of 8 food items: (1) fruits; (2) vegetables, (3) nuts and legumes, (4) low-fat dairy, (5) whole grains, (6) sodium, (7) sugar-sweetened beverages, and, (8) red and processed meats. The scoring was based on quintile rankings within the population studied. For fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy, and whole grains, those in the highest quintile were given a score of 5; 1 point was subtracted for each decreasing quintile, and those in the lowest quintile receive a score of 1.",88204d5c-0406-4983-9fb4-895d8ac89e18
14,methods14," For sodium, sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats, scoring was reversed: those in the highest quintile received a minimum score of 1, whereas participants in the lowest quintile were awarded a maximum score of 5. The score for each component was summed. The total Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores range from 8 (poor diet quality) to 40 points (optimal diet quality) [69].  2.4.5. Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Version 25.0, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to examine the characteristics of the study participants. Results were presented as mean (standard deviation [SD]) or number (percentage) for each group. Correlations between dietary patterns were assessed using the Spearman correlations.   We used mediation analysis in the present work. Mediation analysis hypothesized that the association between exposure and outcome is mediated by a mechanism factor: the mediator.",f306849a-898a-48b8-9fae-be374462a1f8
15,methods15," To be considered a mediator, the following criteria needed to be satisfied: (1) a change in amounts of the exposure significantly affects the changes in the mediator (path a is significant) and (2) there is a significant relationship between the mediator and the outcome (path b is significant), and (3) there is a biological plausibility to support a relationship among exposure, mediator, and outcomes. Our conceptual framework based on the available evidence (Figure 1) and justifies exploratory hypothesis testing by mediation analyses. In contrast to the traditional logic of Baron and Kennedy in 1986 [78], a reduction of the effect of the exposure on the outcome in the presence of the mediator (the direct effect is significant) was not necessarily an a-priori assumption to conduct mediation analyses in our work. Rather, our approach was consistent with the recent advancements of Zhao et al. [79], Hayes and Rockwood [80] and MacKinnon et al.",29dae0b9-39e3-48a4-a5d8-325d3cc10857
16,methods16," [81], which support the justification of mediation analysis where the null hypothesis (the indirect effect is zero) is rejected after a significant relationship between (1) the exposure and outcome and (2) the mediator and the outcome is observed. That is, the interpretation of mediation is measured by the size of the indirect effect, not by the lack of a direct effect per se. Moreover, this approach is more likely biologically and clinically translatable than traditional analyses to explain the relevance of nutrition to reproductive health, which is not always explained by simple associations [52].  All exposure, mediator, and outcome variables were examined for normality of residuals using linear regression analyses and visual inspection of histograms and probability plots. Based on the residual diagnostic results, all analyses were performed using log-transformed mediators and outcome variables.",4b5e47f0-4391-4d77-8f48-fb7724de3ee7
17,methods17,"   In the first stage of the analysis, linear regressions were performed to examine a “direct” link between dietary patterns and ovarian morphology, and to identify potential mediators that could explain an “indirect” effect between factors. Associations were examined between (1) dietary patterns and ovarian morphology; (2) dietary patterns and mediators; and (3) mediators and ovarian morphology, and unstandardized β was reported. Standardized β was also reported so that the effect estimates can be appropriately compared across the 4 evaluated dietary patterns.  In the second stage of the analysis, regression-based simple mediation tests were used to examine whether the associations between dietary patterns and ovarian morphology could be explained through indirect effects (also known as mediation effects) by each of the mediator variables. The regression-based simple mediation framework is illustrated in Figure 1A–D.",8e0892dc-a539-4840-8dfc-cb64ed4acc50
18,methods18,"  In the third stage of the analysis, serial multiple mediation regressions were used to examine the effects of dietary patterns on ovarian morphology through the pathways of a series of mediators. The regression-based serial mediation framework is illustrated in Figure 1E.   Accordingly, β was estimated as the product-of-coefficient approach (unstandardized and standardized) at both (simple and serial) stages of mediation analyses. Details of interpretation of β at each stage are described in the Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Data 2 (Table footnotes), and Figure legends, where appropriate.   All the mediation analyses were adjusted for relevant lifestyle confounders, including age (y), race (categorical), and total daily energy intake (kcal/d). Given the potential mediating effect of obesity in the relationship between dietary patterns and ovarian morphology, we chose to explore the effects of BMI as a mediator factor and removed it from the covariate list.",38156ffc-3dd6-4490-a681-cc6a3ced638f
19,methods19," Because HEI-2015 and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores do not include a specific component for alcohol, we ran additional sub-analyses adjusting for alcohol intake; however, since 51.4% (57/111) of our participants had 0–1.5 g/d alcohol intake, we chose to remove alcohol from the final adjustment. All statistical tests were based on a-priori hypotheses. Therefore, no adjustments were performed for multiple testing.   The pathway analyses were performed using the PROCESS macro for SPSS (Version 3.4) developed by Hayes [82]. Our analyses drew 50,000 bootstrapped samples to estimate the most accurate effect estimate as small sample sizes may bias the evaluation of the mediation effect. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05.  3. Results 3.1. Descriptive Statistics of Participants The characteristics of the study participants are presented in Table 1. Overall, women were young (mean age = 27.8 years) and primarily White (73/111 [65.8%]).",5c0ba1e6-10fc-40d0-a643-6e9318aac571
20,methods20," Sixteen percent (18/111) of all women had obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). Collectively, women had an intermediate diet quality, as evidenced by their dietary pattern scores (mean [SD], 65.5 [13] vs. total score range references, 1–100) for HEI-2015 score; (53.7 [13] vs. total score range references, 1–110) for aHEI-2010 score; (4 [2] vs. total score range references, 1–9) for aMED score; and, (24 [5] vs. total score range references, 8–40) for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (Table 1).   3.2. Correlations between Dietary Patterns There were moderate correlations between the four evaluated dietary patterns (ρ = 0.48–0.73; p < 0.01; Table 2). The strongest correlations were observed between the aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary indices (ρ = 0.73), and between the HEI-2015 and aHEI-2010 indices (ρ = 0.70). None of the evaluated dietary patterns were perfectly (ρ > 0.90) correlated to suggest multicollinearity (All: p < 0.01).  3.3.",089815e7-23ff-4b07-be5c-68275d49096f

Direct Associations between Dietary Patterns and Ovarian Characteristics Results of linear regression analyses showed no direct associations between ovarian characteristics and dietary patterns (All: p ≥ 0.89; Table 3).   3.3.2. Associations between Dietary Patterns and Metabolic and Reproductive Measures (Path a) There were inverse associations between the markers of obesity, including BMI, WC, and WHR, and all four dietary patterns (Supplementary Table S1). A 1-SD increase in the aMED diet score was associated with a 0.26 SD lower BMI (p < 0.05) and 0.28 SD lower WC (p < 0.01). Increased HEI-2015, aHEI-2010, and aMED scores were associated with reduced fasting insulin, HOMA-IR index, and glucose area under the 2 hr response curves (AUC) (p < 0.05, Supplementary Table S1). Namely, a 1-SD increase in the aMED diet score was associated with a 0.25 SD lower fasting insulin, 0.23 SD lower HOMA-IR, and 0.",121f5594-0b77-4b64-ab11-3074984cbbf4

Simple Mediation Analyses Evaluating Associations between Dietary Patterns and Ovarian Characteristics Results of simple mediation analyses revealed that BMI, WC, glucose area under the 2 hr response curves (AUC), and free androgen index (FAI) individually mediated the relationship between aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary patterns and the markers of ovarian characteristics (Figure 2). After adjusting for age, race, and energy intake, a 1-SD increase in the aMED score was associated with 0.08 (Figure 2A) and 0.09 (Figure 2B) SD decrease in OV through reduced BMI and WC, respectively (p < 0.05). A 1-SD increase in the aMED (Figure 2C) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) (Figure 2D) scores decreased OV by 0.07 SD through decreased glucose area under the 2 hr response curves (AUC) (p < 0.05).",03dc4044-8b2f-435a-bd7e-e166b345c36e
24,methods24," A 1-SD increase in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was associated with a 0.10 (Figure 2E) and 0.07 (Figure 2F) SD decrease in OV and follicle number per ovary (FNPO), respectively, through reduced free androgen index (FAI) (p < 0.05). More details of simple associations across all evaluated dietary patterns are available in Supplementary Table S3.   3.4.2. Serial Mediation Analyses Evaluating Associations between Dietary Patterns and Ovarian Characteristics Results of serial mediation analyses showed indirect associations between aMED and ovarian characteristics after adjusting for age, race, and energy intake (Figure 3). The associations were sequentially mediated by WC, glucose area under the 2 hr response curves (AUC), free androgen index (FAI), and length of the menstrual cycle. A 1-SD increase in the aMED score was associated with a 0.03 SD decrease in OV (Figure 3A) and a 0.02 SD decrease in follicle number per ovary (FNPO) (Figure 3B).",c7c05857-6055-4932-b3a0-955ad528e8f1
25,methods25," More details of serial associations across all four dietary patterns are available in Supplementary Table S4. Indirect associations between dietary patterns and ovarian characteristics yielded smaller effect sizes that did not remain significant across smaller polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and control subgroups (All p > 0.05; data not shown) yet showed the comparable direction of associations in each subset when compared to all women.  4. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the relationship between diet quality and ovarian morphology. While we observed no direct associations between diet quality, as assessed by dietary patterns, and ovarian morphology on ultrasonography, our findings suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan are indirectly associated with improved ovarian morphology, as evidenced by lower follicle populations and ovarian size.",e2ef1301-19f3-4aa7-ac1c-1d31b8e325a5
26,methods26," Our observations revealed that obesity, as evaluated by increased BMI and WC, IR as evaluated by increased glucose response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and hyperandrogenism, as evaluated by increased free androgen index (FAI), are likely the key factors in explaining the indirect relationship between lower diet quality and ovarian dysmorphology. Our observations are hypothesis-generating only and provide a novel framework for future intervention studies to elucidate the clinical significance of these associations on ovarian function and the underlying mechanisms through which diet could affect ovarian function across a spectrum of reproductive potential.   We observed that adherence to aMED and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan was indirectly associated with decreased follicle number per ovary (FNPO) and OV.",2b82bf8b-21eb-45ab-a1d9-bd12a5fbc14c
27,methods27," These observations are consistent with a higher likelihood of normal ovarian form and function in women with improved hormonal and/or metabolic status that consume healthier diets [41,45,46,83,84,85]. Both increased follicle counts and enlarged ovaries are recognized risk determinants for chronic anovulation and subfertility [49]. Accumulation of small follicles reflects impairments in the follicle development, which are known to exacerbate anovulation [24,50,86,87] through pre-established mechanisms [24,40,88,89]. Likewise, enlarged ovaries may be the result of hyperplasia in ovarian connective tissue associated with excessive androgen synthesis and anovulation [37,90,91].   The correlations among the evaluated dietary indices were moderate (ρ = 0.48–0.73) since all indices were designed to emphasize higher consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and de-emphasize the consumption of red and processed meat.",1796d3f7-a9b1-436e-8c8a-642869ab6feb
28,methods28," By contrast, each dietary pattern represented a unique combination of dietary components, scoring system, and classification methodology; thereby, individual evaluations were feasible [7,65,66,68,69,71]. There are important differences between aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and evaluated HEI indices in the present study that can explain our observations [92]. Both the aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were designed to emphasize the intake of foods versus nutrients and have fewer food items (8 and 9, respectively). However, only the aMED score has individual components for legumes, nuts, and fish. Consumption of these food items has been emphasized in the aMED score more than the other indices. Moreover, aMED includes the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat.",2705ef4a-f94d-435f-ba7f-8917e3b0ff7e
29,methods29," On the other hand, only the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has sodium, low-fat dairy, and sugar-sweetened beverage components compared to other indices.   Mechanisms through which specific dietary patterns can affect ovarian morphology appear to majorly target adiposity and metabolic status. The aMED diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan are characterized by favorable combinations of dietary components, including high dietary fiber, refined composition, and proportion of macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, and other dietary factors with antioxidant properties, such as phenolic compounds (e.g., resveratrol) derived from complex carbohydrates [69,75,93,94,95].",3a36a44b-c5c3-4bdb-a0a7-55590bd19ae9
30,methods30," Refinement in the composition and dosage of dietary carbohydrate and fiber and anti-inflammatory/oxidative properties of these diets have been shown to decrease IR, dysglycemia, hyperandrogenism, obesity, and induce satiety and weight loss in women with anovulation and abnormal ovarian morphology, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in recent years [22,85,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103] and their respective mechanisms have been described in greater detail previously [94,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114]. Further, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan includes a low saturated fat dairy component that provides vitamin D, whereas aMED includes a fish component rich in ω-3 polyunsaturated fat and is designed to increase the ratio of monounsaturated fat to saturated fat intake.",0280c403-292b-4b5a-9e0e-86b9f879478e
31,methods31," These refinements in the type and composition of fatty acid intakes have been shown to improve ovarian steroidogenesis [115] and influence follicular development by modulating serum FSH concentrations in women [116,117]. A recent report of negative associations between serum AMH concentrations with mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids in healthy women [118] supports the protective effects of these fatty acids on follicular development. Vitamin D receptors are widely distributed across the female reproductive system, including the ovaries [119]. Animal studies have shown the benefits of vitamin D intake on ovarian steroidogenesis and follicular maturation [120,121]. However, the influence of vitamin D intake on female reproductive health remains unknown [122,123,124]. The aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indices emphasize reducing the intake of red meat and increasing protein intake from fish and dairy products.",aed265fd-ea14-4c32-9b18-38dd0b33878e
32,methods32," Previous studies have shown the benefits of dairy protein on decreasing antral follicle counts in infertile women [125] and fish consumption on blastocyst formation [126], as well as the adverse effects of red meat consumption on ovulation [127]. Decreased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and dietary sodium is recommended in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index and was shown to increase glucose regulation [128], reduce IR [129], and abdominal adiposity [130] in women. Together, our observations support emerging evidence on the benefits of adherence to aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plans on improving obesity and metabolic control in women with ovarian dysfunction, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [94,101,131,132,133]. These observations may also suggest a potential benefit of these dietary patterns on ovarian morphology, which has implications for the clinical management of women with ovulatory disorders.",4860b4fa-538f-491e-a8c3-1ef3483b705a
33,methods33," However, more research is required to confirm these findings and identify any potential direct effects of diet on ovarian health.   Our conclusions are subject to limitations inherent to the cross-sectional design, small sample size, and incomplete knowledge of all potential covariates and other influencing factors, including physical activity, smoking, infertility or pregnancy history, which likely affect female reproductive health [134]. Assessment of oocyte quality was beyond the scope of the present work. Our study included both women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Our subgroup analyses revealed similar patterns/directions of associations between diet quality and ovarian morphology in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and control subsets when compared to all women, yet marginally smaller effect sizes that did not reach statistical significance possibly due to our smaller sample sizes in each sub-set.",28676166-9c9d-4823-ac2a-204bc512237e
34,methods34," However, we acknowledge that defining women based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria does not account for polycystic ovaries, thereby neglecting milder phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We were restricted in expanding on our mediation models and to model combined serial and parallel mediation and moderation processes by including additional biological variables (e.g., estrogen status) to test our hypothesis based on a-priori variables (e.g., obesity, insulin, and androgen status) due to the PROCESS macro limitations, which are not uncommon in studies of this type [135]. Therefore, the present work does not account for any complex (synergistic or antagonistic) interactions among mediators. Subjective assessments of dietary intake may tend toward random or systematic error, recall bias, underreporting, and reactivity [136,137]. This study also has several strengths.",38d6902d-feba-46e3-83b8-ce3e13c49956
35,methods35," We used a multi-dimensional and comprehensive approach to identify the relationship between diet quality and ovarian morphology [6,67] and evaluated diet quality using major a-priori established dietary patterns. We uniformly evaluated ovarian morphology using high-resolution real-time ultrasonography and meticulous post hoc analysis of follicle number per ovary (FNPO) [42,138] and used a gold standard methodology for measuring TT concentrations. Our assessment of ovarian morphology was based on a single cycle vs. serial assessments, which limits our ability to detect inter-cycle variability in ovarian morphology that has been shown to be moderate in some studies [139,140,141,142,143].",bc663ed8-f1bf-4dcb-b9ee-3e78deda2e33
36,methods36," Therefore, future research is required to evaluate longitudinal changes in ovarian morphology in response to adherence to aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plans to provide deeper insight into the potential relationship between diet and ovarian function and reveal a more comprehensive and reliable picture about when these changes may become evident. Nevertheless, our findings are also particularly informative since adherence to the Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary patterns have been implicated in reducing the risk of chronic disease and certain gynecologic cancers [2,69,75,76,93,95,144,145,146] and could be used to improve reproductive and metabolic health in women with ovarian dysfunction, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [101,132].  5.",4f5a1acc-7e70-49c3-a8c6-d6f9694f0f7e
37,methods37," Conclusions Women of reproductive age who consume a healthy diet consistent with the Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating patterns may have improved ovarian morphology that likely reflects an improved ovarian function. The association between diet quality and ovarian morphology was primarily mediated by decreases in weight, IR, and hyperandrogenism. Our findings are consistent with emerging evidence about the benefits of these diets on obesity and the metabolic status of reproductive-aged women. Our findings add a new dimension to the existing evidence and provide a conceptual framework for future studies to understand the underlying mechanisms through which diet could affect ovarian health. By extrapolation, our findings have implications for future intervention studies to evaluate the impact of these dietary patterns on ovarian function in reproductive-aged women.
