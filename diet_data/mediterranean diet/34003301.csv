0,methods0," 2.1. Study Participants  In this cross-sectional study, 413 firefighters were recruited from the Indianapolis Fire Department (Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD)) (Indianapolis, IN, USA). The participants were enrolled as part of the study “Feeding America’s Bravest: Mediterranean Diet-Based Interventions to change firefighters’ Eating Habits and Improve Cardiovascular Risk Profiles” between November 2016 and April 2018. Recruitment and consent were carried out by the staff of the National Institute of Public Safety Health. Participants who did not complete baseline anthropometric measurements were excluded from the current analysis. More details on the study methodology and participant recruitment can be found in other literature [22].  2.2. Dietary Assessment  A validated 131-item food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) was administered to the participants [23].",a6b4afce-3f67-4069-8a9b-633f839a4082
1,methods1," The questionnaire collected information on the average frequency of consumption of each food item over the previous 12 months. Food items included dairy foods, fruits, vegetables, eggs, meat, breads, cereals, starches, beverages, sweets, baked goods, etc. [22].  2.3. Physical Activity  Physical activity was collected in participants’ assessments from the fire department medical examinations at Public Safety Medical (Public Safety Medical (PSM)) clinics, which was led by an Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) physician. The examinations included the collection of occupational, smoking, and medical history; a physical examination, including body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and body fat measurements (using bioelectrical impedance); routine laboratory tests; resting electrocardiograms; and maximal treadmill exercise testing.  2.4. Outcome Assessment  At the initial visit, all of the participants underwent blood pressure and anthropometric assessments.",c1a4fd8e-4ee5-4e12-8b8a-8fcd2f6c1ba2
2,methods2," An appropriately sized cuff was used to measure the resting blood pressure while the participants were in a seated position. body mass index (BMI) was recorded for all of the study subjects in kg/m2 and the percentage of body fat was estimated by a Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer (Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer (BIA)) [24,25].  The firefighters had their biochemical indices assessed at the medical examinations. We used the measurements collected from the date closest to the date of study consent and within the same 12-month period. Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast. Using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) collection tubes, 15 mL of blood were collected. Plasma was frozen at −80 °C and the blood lipid profiles of the firefighters were determined using an automated high-throughput enzymatic analysis.",497f456b-eea8-4830-bc3a-e8dc2df03129

Ethics Statement  The overarching “Feeding America’s Bravest” protocol was approved by the Harvard Institutional Review Board (IRB16-0170) ethics committee and is registered at Clinical Trials (NCT02941757). All of the participants provided signed informed consent for participation. The participants who met the criteria for enrollment were all informed about their right to decline participation or to withdraw at any time as per the Declaration of Helsinki, and the participants who decided to enroll gave full informed consent as per the protocol of the research [25].  2.6.",d8f58ccf-aa64-4e36-b4e4-fb7eb21dfd63
4,methods4," Statistical Analysis  The principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) was used to identify the dietary patterns of the firefighters at baseline. A scree test was used to identify the number of factors present. Loading factors were calculated after a varimax rotation to obtain uncorrelated components, which can be more easily interpretable. To obtain a clearer pattern, a cut-off of ≥ |0.2| in factor loadings was applied. Continuous characteristics were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), whereas categorical variables were reported as frequency (percentage) by tertiles of the identfied dietary patterns (low-medium-high) and compared using the ANOVA test or the chi-square test of independence, respectively.",9f3a4641-70d2-4c41-be7a-63ffcc51a540
5,methods5," Linear regression models were used to examine the effect of dietary patterns on cardiometabolic outcomes, after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), body fat percent, max metabolic equivalents (metabolic equivalents (METS)), and oxygen consumption (VO2) max. The resulting beta coefficients, together with the corresponding standard errors and p-values, were presented. As a sensitivity analysis, dietary patterns were used in the models, both as continuous variables as well as in tertiles. All of the statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The alpha level of significance was set at 0.05 and all of the tests were two-tailed.  3. Results  3.1. Baseline Characteristics  A sample of 413 firefighters had complete data for analysis in the current study. Firefighters’ baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The vast majority of the participants were males (94%), with a mean age of 47.2 ± 8.2 years.",7463345d-feee-4821-8488-16669e818d1d
6,methods6," The average body mass index (BMI) in the study population was 30.0 ± 4.5 kg/m2. The average metabolic equivalents (METS) score was 11.6 ± 5.5 and the mean total cholesterol was 196.9 ± 38.3 (mg/dL). The participation rate of the study was 95%.  3.2. Dietary Patterns  Scree tests of the principal component analysis (PCA)s indicated two distinct factors—a Standard American diet (Standard American diet (SAD)) and a Mediterranean diet (MD). In the analysis, the total number of food items was 148, out of which 96 had a loading factor above the pre-set cut-off of ≥ |0.2|. The Mediterranean diet included 57 of these items, and consisted of vegetables (raw spinach (0.673), romaine lettuce (0.601), fruits (peaches, apple), wine, nuts (walnuts), and rice, as shown in Table 2.  Thirty-nine items scored loading factors above |0.2| in the Standard American diet, and those included red meat (hamburger, pork), pasta, and sweets (brownies), as shown in Table 2.  3.3.",7a16f63f-e5d4-4ee9-af70-e58c14da0cff
7,methods7," Categorization of Participants in Accordance with the Dietary Pattern  The cross-tabulation of the 413 participants in tertiles of MD and Standard American diet (SAD) are shown in Table 3. Several participants had both MD and Standard American diet (SAD) scores low as well as both MD and Standard American diet (SAD) high.  3.4. Association of Dietary Patterns with Cardiometabolic Outcomes  Participants in the highest tertile of Western diet were significantly worse in terms of weight, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, cholesterol ratio, and triglycerides scores (Table 4). However, no significant differences were observed among the tertiles of Mediterranean diet.  The associations of dietary patterns with cardiometabolic outcomes are shown in Table 5. In unadjusted regression models, a unitary increase in Standard American diet (SAD) was significantly associated with increases in total cholesterol (β = 4.58, p = 0.014), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (β = 3.",6684ee16-efc5-4ad5-8d0c-d3896b6a6bba

Moreover, there was a significant association between MD and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (β = 1.14, p = 0.045). After adjusting for age, gender, VO2 max, max metabolic equivalents (METS), body mass index (BMI), and body fat percent, Standard American diet (SAD) was significantly associated with a higher body fat percent (β = 0.02, p = 0.922) and cholesterol ratio (β = 0.12, p = 0.026), whereas it was associated with a decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (β = −0.292, p = 0.578). Furthermore, we observed an increase in cholesterol (β = 4.49, p = 0.015) and triglycerides (β = 5.83, p = 0.090), although the results were not statistically significant. Finally, MD was significantly associated with an increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (β = 1.20, p = 0.",6e8702c0-3408-45a0-a4ef-8123186317f2

When tertiles of dietary patterns were considered, the high Standard American diet (SAD) tertile compared with the low tertile was associated with a decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, whereas it was associated with an increase in cholesterol ratio, body mass index (BMI), and body fat. Similarly, medium vs. low tertile of Standard American diet (SAD) was associated with an increase in total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, cholesterol ratio, and glucose. However, when adjusted for other score (MD diet score for Standard American diet (SAD) tertiles and Standard American diet (SAD) diet score for MD tertiles), no statistically significant associations were observed for the tertiles of MD with cardiometabolic outcomes, as shown in Appendix A Table A1.  4.",8ae5e93f-ca72-4122-af03-b34f217c16da
10,methods10," Discussion  Our study identified two major dietary patterns among Indianapolis US firefighters—a Standard American diet and a Mediterranean diet. This was not surprising, given that the Western diet is one of the most common diets among US citizens and the Mediterranean diet is one of the most common diets among people pursuing a healthier lifestyle [20]. Several studies of focus groups found that firefighters have an unhealthy diet when eating at the firehouse, with large portions of food, unhealthy comfort foods, and second servings, whereas at the comfort of their home, they follow a healthier diet [24]. Moreover, several studies have previously argued that the majority of firefighters do not follow any specific dietary plan, although they may have their own routine in place in terms of eating habits. In our population, both dietary patterns share common food items, mainly fruits and vegetables.",2ed6bd83-579f-44a7-934c-db1c214f482c
11,methods11," However, the MD is richer in vegetables, such as spinach, pepper, peas, and dairy, whereas the Standard American diet (SAD) is richer in meat and processed foods, such as beef, hamburger, bacon, sausage, etc. Sharing common food items and mainly fruit and vegetables could be attributed to the fact that people nowadays tend to eat a variety of different foods. Therefore, there is no surprise that people who consume a more Western diet tend to also eat fruits and vegetables as reflected in the dietary pattern.  Our analysis shows that the Mediterranean diet was associated with higher high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. These results are in agreement with those of other studies, suggesting that the Mediterranean pattern, which is characterized by high consumption of vegetables, is a “healthy” diet and can help lower cardiovascular risk [25].",3b4eaf91-97cb-47ed-9e7b-8e5aa6d51021
12,methods12," Furthermore, greater consumption of fruits and vegetables, which is another element of the Mediterranean diet, was linked with higher fiber, folate, and potassium intakes. Dietary fiber may play a protective role against non-communicable diseases. Even though the mechanism for this is not fully understood, higher intakes of fruits and vegetables are strongly associated with lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) development [26,27].  In contrast, the Standard American diet was characterized by high consumption of red meat and sugary foods [28]. Meat and meat products were common constituents of the Standard American diet. In accordance with the US Department of Agriculture (US Department of Agriculture (USDA)), consumers ate on average 100.8 kg of red meat and poultry in 2018 [29]. Meta-analysis studies showed that the greater consumption of processed meat was associated with 42% higher risk of developing coronary heart disease and 19% higher risk of diabetes.",2f8d4c7d-7c85-465a-8fd5-68b6592af4cd
13,methods13," In our study, the Standard American diet was associated with an increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol levels [30,31]. These results support the fact that high saturated fat diets were associated with worse cardiometabolic outcomes.  One limitation of this study is its cross-sectional nature, which does not allow us to infer causation. A second limitation concerns the items used in the food frequency questionnaire, which could be considered as common foods of the MD or Standard American diet (SAD). In addition, they were included in the principal component analysis (PCA) analysis and resulted in a relatively low loading factor. Therefore, the pre-set cut-off was |0.2|. A third limitation concerns the very low number of female participants (6%). However, this reflects the current demographic of the US career fire service.",e3bb26e0-7e43-42e1-bd8a-e6a40e8a94cf
14,methods14," One of the strengths of the study is that with the help and support of the Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD), the Indianapolis Local 416 fire station, and the recruited participants, we were able to collect all the necessary medical data required for the analysis. Another strength is that all our data were collected from the medical files of the participants with the help of a team of trained physicians, thus ensuring their validity.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, this is one of the first studies in the US to report on specific dietary patterns among firefighters. These patterns were identified as the Mediterranean diet and the Standard American diet. In addition, the present findings confirmed and further strengthened the current knowledge regarding the positive associations of the Mediterranean diet and the negative associations of the Standard American diet on cardiometabolic outcomes.",896e7207-1287-448c-b1fa-a1893b6d6c1b
15,methods15," Further studies should investigate the role of diet in specific populations, as identifying the different diet components can assist in the creation of programs that improve the health of firefighters to save lives. ",c6fb1d3f-a0ab-49e4-b5f5-cc626e4d840c
