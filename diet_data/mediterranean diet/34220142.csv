0,methods0," Study Design and Participants  This analysis was based on baseline and 1 year data of the multicenter PREDIMED-Plus trial. The study protocol, including study design and data collection, has been published (19) and can be found at the PREDIMED-Plus website (https://www.predimedplus.com/en/). The detailed description of design and aims of the study could be found in Appendix 1 . All authors had access to the study data and had reviewed and approved the final manuscript.  Hepatic Steatosis Index  The liver status in terms of risk of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was measured with the Hepatic Steatosis Index (Hepatic steatosis index (HSI)), which was calculated using the described formula:     (1) Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) = 8 xALTAST+ BMI(+ 2 if type 2 diabetes yes, + 2 if female)  A cut-off value of 36 points was used to select patients with a higher risk of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as described in previous reports (20).",65210e35-b327-40ae-9aaa-8ddc3b746e75
1,methods1,  Health-Related Quality of Life  An adapted version of previously published 36-items HRQL questionnaire (SF36-HRQL) was used. This scale is validated for the Spanish population and extensively used to measure the subjective awareness of health and capability or physical constraints to manage with daily tasks. The physical aggregated component of SF 36 (PCS) SF-36 index was calculated according to previously published coefficients (18).  Statistical Analyses  Data from 5021 participants were included ( Figure 1 ). The patient’s characteristics were defined as mean ± SD for quantitative variables and as proportions for qualitative variables. Participants were stratified according to the Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) quartiles and regarding the 36-point cut-off at baseline. The score for each category of the SF36-HRQL tests as well as for the physical component dimension were evaluated as continuous variables. Data among quartiles were compared using ANOVA.,e50b1aee-e317-4cd4-b2cd-117aa5335de9
2,methods2," For longitudinal analyses, data from volunteers with missing or implausible values for the defined variables at 1 year of follow-up were excluded, including 3902 participants ( Figure 1 ). Longitudinal analysis for the variation of the SF-36 components were analyzed with correlation panels. Afterwards, linear mixed model with individual random effect adjusted by age, sex, recruitment center, daily alcohol consumption, total caloric intake, waist circumference and number of metabolic syndrome features were applied to evaluate and compare the response of SF-36 physical aggregated component of SF 36 (PCS) depending on er-MeDiet and PA adherence in both Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) < 36 and Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) ≥ 36 subgroups. Contrasts were performed including the interaction between modifiable factors (Mediterranean diet adherence and physical activity) as an independent variable in the model. Two-tailed level of 0.05 were considered as a threshold for statistical significance.",82a03a0e-f34f-49f6-b702-1d79bbd579ad

4,results0," Population Description and Liver Status Assessment at Baseline  A total of 5,021 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in the study ( Figure 1 ). At baseline, the mean age of the study sample was 65.10 ± 4.91 years with a 48.1% of female participants. Demographic, anthropometric, lifestyle characteristics and MetS features are described by Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) quartiles ( Table 1 ) and by Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) validated cut-off values Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) >36 and Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) < 36 ( Supplementary Table 1 ). As expected, participants with higher Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) index showed higher levels of glucose, tryglicerides and liver enzymes. They also showed higher BMI and waist perimeter and lower HDL levels. They also showed a worse lifestyle indicated by a lower adherence to a MedDiet, lower PA and higher sedentarism.",b8851f2f-4449-4f7e-8e8a-b1dc9947f3bb
5,results7, dividing patients between those with a Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) score below 36 (lower probability of liver steatosis) and those with 36 points or more in the Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) score (higher probability of liver steatosis). Both models showed a different response in terms of HRQoL to lifestyle changes depending on liver status in both er-MeDiet and PA adherence (p < 0.05 respectively). This data are shown in Figure 2 .  Figure 2 (A) Correlation of HRQoL increase and er-MeDiet adherence modification in patients with higher Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) probability and lower Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) probability.

6,results8,"  According to these results, mixed multivariate regression models were developed to evaluate the consequences of er-MeDiet adherence and PA in patients with lower probability of liver steatosis according to Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) < 36 points and those with a high probability of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) ≥ 36 points) including baseline and 1 year of follow up data.  In the evaluation of er-MeDiet, differences were found between both subgroups in physical role, and physical aggregated component of SF 36 (PCS) after adjustment by age, sex, recruitment node, total calory intake, alcohol consumption, waist circumference, number of items of the MetS and PA. The physical aggregated component of SF 36 (PCS) response to er-MeDiet adherence was found to be higher in patients with lower Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) (β 0.58 CI 95% 0.27-1.00) in comparison with those with a Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) ≥ 36 points (β 0.07 CI 95% -0.06-0.",b5d9a659-8f15-49df-a3b9-7a3fa65344b2

These results were not replicated when stratifying patients in the different components of the Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) (ALT/AST ratio, BMI, fasting blood glucose > 100 mg/dl and sex) or by age ( Supplementary Tables 1, 2 ). Data were plotted to show the influence of er-MeDiet adherence in terms of HRQoL variation ( Figure 3A ). In this figure, the linear mixed model predicts the annual increase of HRQoL depending on the er-MeDiet score providing that patients with high probability of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) tend to be resistant to increases in er-MeDiet adherence, while patients with lower Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk are very sensitive to dietary changes in terms of HRQoL aggregated physical domain.",78602507-87ec-400d-8df6-6832c3221796

11,results14,"  In the evaluation of PA, patients with a higher improvement in physical role, body pain and vitality scores in response to increases in PA were associated to a lower Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) after previously described adjustments ( Table 3B ). In the evaluation of PA, the Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) influence on HRQoL evolution was not replicated when stratifying patients in the different components of the Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) (ALT/AST ratio, BMI, diabetes and sex) or by age ( Supplementary Tables 2, 3 ). The physical aggregated component of SF 36 (PCS) response to PA was found to improve more in patients with lower Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) (β 0.05 CI 95% 0.03-0.07) in comparison with those with a Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) ≥ 36 points (β 0.03 CI 95% 0.01-0.02) as described ( Table 3B and Figure 3B ).",ed8b8bd4-d8ab-45a6-84cc-35e2eabff42e

14,discussion0," The results from the current research evidence the capacity of a non-invasive evaluation of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to modify the effect of lifestyle over Health-related Quality of Life. The increase in the adherence to a er-MedDiet pattern and PA might lead to more than a 5-fold increase in the aggregated physical domain of HRQoL depending on the presence of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), using previously validated and easy to fulfill scores such as SF-36 and Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) (18, 20). In this context, different methods of detection of liver steatosis have been previously validated, such as ultrasound, controlled attenuation parameters of FibroScan©. Among them, Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) has demonstrated adequacy in the epidemiological study of liver disease (21), while demonstrating a high similar discrimination power than other more expensive or less available detection methods (22).",32a9c4d8-c07c-4b50-96a8-33589cfd0ccb
15,discussion1," Besides, our results provide a clinically relevant objectives in terms of er-MeDiet adherence and PA to improve HRQoL in patients with MetS and lower probability of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to proof the differential effect of lifestyle measures in patients with MetS depending on a non-invasive assessment of liver steatosis.  Interestingly, in our cohort, the Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) score was associated to a lower adherence to er-MeDiet and PA performance and to a higher prevalence and of the components of MetS at baseline. These findings are endorsed by indirect findings and provide further evidence on the association of Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) score and the MetS features (3). Furthermore, these results reinforce the impact of liver steatosis in QoL (20) and might support previous evidence on the use of non-invasive methods for the individualization of patients with MetS in the clinical setting (23–25).",1c13d754-c82a-45a1-9fa4-badbb6f93df6
16,discussion2," Thus, the apparent resistance of patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to lifestyle measures in terms of HRQoL in the longitudinal analysis could adequate the prescription of the therapeutic armamentarium in these patients, bringing forward more aggressive treatments in selected subjects, such as GLP-1 analogs and bariatric surgery (26, 27). Beyond, the 10 point er-MeDiet adherence and 50 MET-h/week thresholds for the improvement of HRQoL in patients with lower probability of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may provide a goal of lifestyle change in these patients as well as an objective evaluation and counselling in the clinical setting.",6c3b82a9-970e-45f3-a263-0db310021ec4
17,discussion3," Therefore, our study could contribute to the development of new lifestyle-based intervention guidelines for patients with MetS according to the liver status which in fact, may also provide further benefits in the cardiovascular disease scenario, due to the association of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and atherosclerotic disease development (28, 29).  With regard of the impact of Mediterranean diet and PA in HRQoL depending on the liver status, some aspects should be emphasized. The effect of Mediterranean diet has been previously related to the MetS prevention and control after 1 year follow up (30). Besides, MedDiet pattern has also been related to HRQoL in previous series and in the present cohort (31). Similar results were found on PA relationship to HRQoL, with a direct relationship to the control of MetS and HRQoL. However, the concept of a modulation of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) status in the impact of er-MeDiet and PA on HRQoL is new.",aca21d75-0bbf-4129-8f3e-94ff44ddd841
18,discussion4," In fact, interventions tend to be maximized in patients at higher risk (32). Thus, the capacity of Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) to identify patients with a better response to lifestyle as measured with HRQoL parameters might be related to the Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) morbidity burden (33). Other factor that could contribute to our results is the severity of the MetS among progressive Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) values. This fact might be related to a poorer metabolic flexibility of patients with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in terms of body composition (34), insulin resistance (35), microbioma (9) and redox/equilibrium (36) and thus, a reduction on the sensitivity to lifestyle change of this population due to a reduction in homeostasis capability (37).",daa002bd-2c35-4f48-b992-5ec2c430e0cb
19,discussion5,"  In the methodological arena, the design quality of PREDIMED plus provides strength to the present results in terms of inclusion criteria fulfillment, anthropometric and laboratory tests and adherence to er-MeDiet and PA patterns assessment (19). Besides, the SF-36 Physical summary and the Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) index are well validated and universally used indexes in the evaluation of both HRQoL and liver steatosis (18, 20). Even though, some limitations should be addressed. First, the cohort recruitment was designed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on dietary patterns and PA in patients with MetS. Then, the present findings should be externally validated in a different cohort.",a6dba63b-9bae-40f4-abf7-9c0ef1671a36
20,discussion6," In this context, the present analysis does not follow the original strategy of the cohort, resembling to a per-protocol evaluation by using patient information about erMeDiet and PA adherence according to patient declaration and not due to the distribution between the control and intervention branches. Although the characteristics of the full PREDIMED plus trial do not allow to uncover the intervention and control groups, no differences were found in the proportion of patients in the intervention and control groups among Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) < 36 and Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) > 36 (p > 0.05). Besides, although Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) is a remarkable non-invasive tool in the detection of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), this index is not designed for Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) staging. In fact, biopsy directed studies have demonstrated a different distribution of NASH in patients with MetS than in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (38).",efec06b6-26bd-461a-8f11-4e263fea5f36
21,discussion7," Although the Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) staging may exceed the objective of the present study, this feature could be addressed in future studies. Yet, the present results are valuable from the clinical point of view, providing remarkably similar assessment of the influence of adherence to healthy lifestyle patterns in patients’ health as that of the consultation room. The longitudinal multivariate analysis and adjustments, using features related to HRQoL such as waist circumference obesity, MetS features (39), alcohol consumption (40) and total caloric intake (41, 42) provide plausibility to the present results.  In summary, the demonstration of the influence of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the response to lifestyle modifications might represent an interesting tool for personalization and precision medicine in the cardiovascular risk epidemiological and clinical scenarios emphasizing the mediation of liver status in the therapeutical response.",e7dcce63-ef5c-4bcc-8e74-2ac9730cbf7b
22,discussion8," The present findings could encourage future research in the individualization of treatment of patients with MetS based on liver condition.  Conclusion  The detection of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by the Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) index in patients with MetS might identify subjects with lower sensitivity to lifestyle changes in terms of HRQoL. Patients with lower Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) probability begun to obtain improvement on HRQoL at 10 points of er-MeDiet adherence and 50 MET-h/week, providing precision medicine prescriptions depending on liver condition status.
