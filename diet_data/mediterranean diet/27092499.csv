0,background0,"Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue with a consequent increase in bone fragility and increased risk of susceptibility to fracture [1]. Osteoporosis prevalence rises with age and, in consideration of the demographic transition occurring worldwide, it is projected to significantly increase in the next future. In Italy, approximately 3.5 million persons are osteoporotic, and more than 90,000 fractures are yearly reported in subjects older than 50 years [2]. Mortality associated with osteoporotic fractures ranges from 15 to 30%, with a rate similar to breast cancer and stroke [2]. Indeed, osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures are associated with high morbidity and mortality, reduced quality of life and increase in healthcare costs [2]. Therefore, effective prevention and treatment strategies are necessary to prevent osteoporosis and to reduce the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures.",f9862973-b939-4e90-bf23-c79fe31009ef
1,background1,"  Prevention and management of osteoporosis require suitable methods for population screenings and early diagnosis. Currently, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)), with its excellent predictive value for fracture risk, is considered the gold standard imaging technique for the diagnosis of osteoporosis [2]. According to the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)), osteoporosis is defined as a bone mineral density (bone mineral density (BMD)) at the hip and/or the spine at least 2.5 standard deviations below the mean peak bone mass of young healthy adults as determined by dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) [3]. The use of dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) as method for population screenings and primary care diagnosis presents several critical limitations, including the use of ionizing radiation, the large size of the equipment, its high costs and its limited availability.",d612e954-9899-4198-ad28-4e62d4869086
2,background2," Therefore, in the last years it is grown the interest for alternative and reliable pre-screening devices for osteoporosis assessment, such as the quantitative ultrasound (quantitative ultrasound (QUS)) scanners [4–6]. Compared to dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA), quantitative ultrasound (QUS) offers wider accessibility to the public since the apparatus is portable, easier to handle, has a lower cost and not emits ionizing radiation [4–6]. Studies in humans have demonstrated that quantitative ultrasound (QUS) can reflect bone quality and predict risk for future fracture, and therefore quantitative ultrasound (QUS) can be used as tool for population screening of osteoporosis [4–6].  Several risk factors have been identified for primary osteoporosis [1, 2]. Among these, nutrition is widely accepted as an environmental factor affecting bone health. Adequate nutrition is essential to achieve and maintain optimal bone mass and to prevent osteoporosis [7, 8].",1547f6a8-5505-4daf-a041-ba23e179946d
3,background3," Many nutritional factors have been suggested to play a potential role in the risk modulation of this disabling disease. Historically, calcium and vitamin D were the primary nutrients considered for osteoporosis prevention, however nutritional benefits for bone have been demonstrated for several additional dietary factors, including vitamins (A, B, C, E, K), minerals (potassium, magnesium, silicon) and macronutrients (protein and fats). All these factors may influence bone and mineral homeostasis and modulate the long-term bone health [7, 8]. In this context, Mediterranean diet (MD) is a specific eating pattern that combines several foods and nutrients proposed to act as protective factors in the development and progression of several chronic diseases [9].  To date, the relationships between bone health and MD adherence have been evaluated only in a limited number of cross-sectional studies, with contrasting results.",c6bea7e1-f1bf-4f63-8f9b-e5451a979d3e

Calibration of the apparatus was performed daily, and measurement were recorded according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, measurements were performed with the patient seated and its foot positioned and secured in the Sahara system with a positioning aide. After the patient’s foot was secured, a pair of soft elastomer pads were brought into contact with opposite sides of the patient’s heel with a motorized caliper mechanism.

10,methods5," Inaudible high frequency sound waves, produced by one of the sound transducers, were transmitted through the heel and received by the opposite transducer. Quantitative parameters describing the speed and attenuation of the sound waves in the heel were measured. Ultrasound devices routinely measure two parameters: broadband ultrasound attenuation (broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA)) and speed of sound (speed of sound (SOS)) and the combination of these two measured values allow to calculate the quantitative ultrasound index (quantitative ultrasound index (QUI)), sometimes referred as “stiffness” in the scientific literature. The quantitative ultrasound index (QUI)/Stiffness value obtained for the patient is then converted into estimated bone mineral density (BMD) (in units of g/cm2) and T-score. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), patients were considered osteopenic when T-score was −1/−2.5 and were considered osteoporotic when T-score was lower than −2.5 [3].",60cb2cd2-e727-4c5b-aa3f-f6af6fc9bb76

23,discussion1," The interesting finding of our study was that T-score was positively associated with PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score; particularly, at the multinomial logistic regression of T-scores with PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score, the higher T-scores were positively associated with the highest odds of PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) score. This finding suggest that a higher adherence to MD is associated with better bone health status.  To date, it is widely accepted that adequate nutrition is essential to achieve and maintain optimal bone mass, and dietary approaches can represent an important strategy for osteoporosis prevention [7, 8]. Several nutritional factors are known to play a role in skeletal health. Among these, calcium and vitamin D are considered the primary nutrients for osteoporosis prevention in older adults [7, 8].",9bc5d567-ade2-4e8e-8984-58d2e937525e
24,discussion2," However, emerging evidences indicate that additional nutrients such as vitamins (A, B, C, E, K), minerals (potassium, magnesium, silicon) and macronutrients (protein and fats) may contribute to skeletal health by supporting both bone matrix production and mineralization [7, 8].  Recent evidences reported differences in the severity of osteoporosis across the European Union Countries, suggesting a lower incidence of the disease in the Mediterranean area. This effect has been mainly attributed to specific eating pattern [13, 14]. The term “Mediterranean Diet” is currently used in the literature to indicate the traditionally dietary habits of the people living in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.",b9ef9a69-3ca9-4561-9a58-e0bfe4ae620f
25,discussion3," Indeed, MD consists in a high consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fruits and nuts, a moderate consumption of poultry and fish (varying with proximity to the sea), a low consumption of dairy products and red meat, and low-to-moderate consumption of wine as the main source of alcohol accompanying meals [9]. The protective role of MD against several diseases, such as cardiovascular, neoplastic, neurodegenerative and other chronic diseases is now well defined [9, 15–19]. One of the most accredited hypothesis for this association suggests that the protective effects of MD are mediated by the anti-inflammatory properties of beneficial compounds, like polyphenols, that are largely present in the Mediterranean foods such as vegetables, fruits and red wine [20]. In particular, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is one of components of the MD and represent the main edible fat.",e34b8f56-e13f-4251-b50b-cbd31808a82d
26,discussion4," Its increased consumption is reflected in the high monounsaturated to saturated fatty acid and has been found to be associated with a reduced prevalence of risk factors for major chronic inflammatory diseases included osteoporosis [7, 13, 21]. Adherence to MD has been associated with higher bone mineral density (BMD) and has been shown to prevent bone disease [9, 13, 14, 22–24]. The Framingham Osteoporosis Study Cohorts previously showed that a dietary pattern similar to MD was predictive of greater bone mineral density (BMD) in adults [22]. Similarly, adherence to the MD, measured as a Mediterranean diet score, was confirmed to have beneficial effects on bone mineral density (BMD) in healthy women from Southern Spain [23]. The positive correlation between bone health parameters and adherence to the MD was also identified in a previous report of our group, on a small sample of elderly (>65 years) [24].",ce02882b-0f84-4f72-861c-e8e8b4f58698
27,discussion5," In addition, the potential protective effect of the MD against the risk of hip fractures has been also studied and a higher adherence to MD was associated with a lower risk in both genders [25–27]. In contrast, different studies suggested that a high consumption of fish and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and a low red meat intake rather than MD per se were positively correlated with bone mass [28–30].  The positive effects of MD on bone could be attributed to the combined beneficial effects of individual components of the MD. Accordingly, the present study reported the specific association between T-score and food items included in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire. A higher T-score was significantly associated with a higher consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), vegetables, fruits, legumes and fish and negatively associated with consumption of red meat.",dd0ef7de-7ee5-4d8d-918c-a2d0a48f73ba
28,discussion6," Among the specific food items included in MD, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), fish and fruits are the best predictors of T-score.  Of note, in the present work adherence to MD has been evaluated using the 14-items questionnaire of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) study [12]. This is less time-demanding, less expensive and requires less collaboration from participants than the usual full-length food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) or other more comprehensive methods [20]. Moreover, this questionnaire allows to provide feedback to the participant immediately after the interview is completed. Nevertheless, this method is very reliable, being previously validated against the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used in the study [31].  In this study, the bone status has been evaluated using the calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS).",e951766e-8c2c-4040-9ba2-c2c5b308d368
29,discussion7," We are aware that dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the most commonly used and validated method for bone densitometry in clinical practice [2], however it should be considered that the study has been performed in an outdoor hospital held in a public squares. In these conditions, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) is more suitable for a population screening, since the apparatus is portable and easier to handle. Moreover, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) has been confirmed to be able to predict risk for future fracture in humans [4–6]. In particular, the calcaneus has been chosen as a site for measurement since it is easily accessible, well-suited for optimizing the geometry of transmission of the ultrasound (US) wave through it, and it contains approximately 90% trabecular bone which present a high metabolic turnover rate and a pattern of bone loss similar to the spine [6].",46dba24f-9c30-42d0-9ba1-d7cf8ab82fc0
30,discussion8," For these reasons, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) is becoming a frequently used method for the assessment of bone quality even if it can only be considered as a pre-screening tool. A subsequent confirmatory diagnosis is necessary with a dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) evaluation [4–6].  An additional limit of the present study is that information concerning vitamin D status, calcium intake and body composition of the enrolled subjects are missing. Indeed, in the present study we could obtain preliminary information on the bone health status of healthy subjects and correlate the results with a specific dietary pattern.  Conclusions In summary, this work demonstrates a positive correlation between bone health status and adherence to MD. The results suggest that higher adherence to MD plays a beneficial role in bone health and confirm that a specific dietary approach, such as MD, can represent an important modifiable environmental factor for osteoporosis’ prevention.",de5538ba-1ff3-4431-8fa7-27c9d0906d6b
