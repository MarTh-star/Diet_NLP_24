0,background0," Little is known about the associations between healthy dietary patterns and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)) in less-developed ethnic minority regions (LEMRs), where the prevalence of metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is increasing rapidly and dietary habits are quite different from those in developed countries. Moreover, a significant subset of metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) individuals in LEMRs are nonobese, but the efficacy of dietary patterns on metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) individuals with different obese statuses is also unclear.",5e4b0d15-cdaf-43d6-aee2-905fc7179e9e
1,background1," We aimed to test the associations of two wildly recommended a priori dietary patterns—Alternate Mediterranean diet (a priori dietary patterns—Alternate Mediterranean diet (AMED)) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH))—with the risk of metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in the total population, and further in nonobese and obese individuals.

2,methods0," Study population  The China Multi Ethnic Cohort (CMEC) study is a population-based prospective cohort study involving approximately 100,000 adults from six ethnic minority groups as well as the majority Han group in less-developed Southwest China. Details of the study design have been described previously [19]. In brief, 99,556 participants were recruited at a baseline survey between May 2018 and September 2019, given a full consideration of the diversity in socioeconomic status (SES), ethnic characteristics, and disease patterns. All participants completed a full laptop-based questionnaire with face-to-face interviews and underwent anthropometric measurement and blood tests by well-trained health workers. The flowchart of the study population is depicted in Figure 1.",ac5f9dfc-46bd-424b-8316-7b830c8b3755
3,methods1," We excluded participants who were aged < 30 or >79 years at the baseline survey, had no available information on diet and outcome data, had extreme total energy intake (< 600 or > 3500 kcal/day for females and < 800 or > 4200 kcal/day for males), and had implausible body mass index (BMI) (< 14 or > 45 kg/m2). Furthermore, to eliminate potential reverse causality, 24,926 participants who self-reported physicians diagnosed with chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer at the baseline survey were excluded. Finally, a total of 66,526 eligible participants were included in the main analysis.Fig. 1 Flowchart of the study.

All the participants provided their written informed consent before data collection.  Data on diet  Dietary information was collected at baseline using a quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) based on the Chinese Dietary Guidelines and the eating habits of Southwestern Chinese, covering 13 major food groups: rice, wheat products, coarse grain, tubers, red and processed meats, poultry, fish/sea food, eggs, dairy products, fresh vegetables, preserved vegetables, fresh fruits, and soybean products. Participants were asked how often on average during the preceding 12 months they had consumed each food group and how many grams per meal according to a standard serving size molds.",17582d74-53bd-492d-8a2c-1488e22a21ee
5,methods3," For alcohol and sweeten beverage, the frequency, quantity, and types of consumption were collected; for oil and salt, the household consumption and how many persons eat at home at breakfast, lunch, dinner during the past month were asked. Finally, we calculated the daily consumption of each food group and alcohol as well as the average consumption of cooking oil and salt per person. Total energy intake was estimated based on the China food exchange lists and the 2018 China food composition tables (standard edition) [20, 21]. In addition, to assess the reproducibility, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was repeated during the repeated survey from August 2020 to November 2020 in nearly 10% of the baseline participants. Additionally, in a subsample of 1,163 participants, we conducted a three-day nonconsecutive 24-hour dietary recall (24HDR) to assess the validity of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).",4be7516d-920b-4c16-b93d-accb51a54224
6,methods4," The Spearman rank correlation coefficients for reproducibility between the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) food groups ranged from 0.16 for fresh vegetables to 0.62 for alcohol and tea, and the de-attenuated Spearman rank correlation coefficients for validity ranged from 0.1 for soybean products to 0.66 for rice. More details are provided in our previous study [22].  Scores of dietary patterns  Scores for the two dietary patterns (i.e., a priori dietary patterns—Alternate Mediterranean diet (AMED) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) were computed for all participants. The a priori dietary patterns—Alternate Mediterranean diet (AMED) score was designed to assess adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern based on an adapted version of traditional Mediterranean diet for a non-Greek population [23–25].",a775690a-2134-4d54-bf4e-9c46310956f4
7,methods5," We focused on 8t key food or nutrient group components: fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish, ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids (MUFA:SFA ratio), red and processed meats, alcohol. The food group component of nuts was eliminated in our study because information on nuts consumption was not collected separately. For each of the components (except for alcohol), all participants were classified into quintiles according to their intake ranking. For fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish, MUFA:SFA ratio, participants in the highest quintile received a score of 5, and those in the lowest quintile received a score of 1. For red and processed meats, participants in the highest quintile received a score of 1, and those in the lowest quintile received a score of 5.",a16ead98-071e-49ca-b8ce-15b89d97df21

Then, we assigned scores of 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 to corresponding individuals, respectively. The total score ranges from 8 to 40, and higher values of the score indicated greater adherence to a priori dietary patterns—Alternate Mediterranean diet (AMED).  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was developed to measure adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet. Due to the low consumption of nonfat and low-fat dairy products in our study population, a modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score with nonfat and low-fat dairy replaced by full-fat dairy products [26] was adopted in our study.",2561bcf5-e90f-4841-9095-6dea031bb37e
9,methods7," Additionally, we eliminated the food group component of sweetened beverages because the regular consumption of sweetened beverages was extremely low in our study population. As with the a priori dietary patterns—Alternate Mediterranean diet (AMED) score, the food group component of nuts was excluded. We constructed the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score based on quintile rankings within the population of each component as well, focusing on 7 components: fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, full-fat dairy products, sodium, red and processed meat. For the first 5 components, the lowest intake was assigned 1 point, and the highest intake was assigned 5 points. In contrast, for sodium, red and processed meat, reverse scoring for the quintile ranks is used. By summing the component scores, we obtained an overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score for each participant, ranging from 7 (no adherence) to 35 (perfect adherence).",8ebd79a9-5a87-4595-8d2d-cd89cc0c4426
10,methods8," A detailed scoring criterion for dietary patterns is given in Supplementary Table 1-3.  Study outcome  The outcome of this study was metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). All participants underwent abdominal ultrasound, anthropometry measurements and blood tests at the baseline survey. Abdominal ultrasound was performed to assess the presence of hepatic steatosis by qualified ultrasonographers. Weight and height were measured by trained health workers using standardized methods. body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared; the body mass index (BMI) cutoff value of 25 kg/m2 was used to define the nonobese and obese Asian population, which is a widely used cutoff established by the WHO [27]. Waist circumference was measured as the midpoint between the iliac crest and the lower costal margin with tape all around the body in the horizontal position, taking the average of two measurements.",6935d648-2c57-4da5-9efb-791de87977c5
11,methods9," For blood pressure, trained health workers measured blood pressure three times using an Omron HEM-8711 blood pressure monitor after participants had rested in a seated position for at least 5 min. For blood tests, after overnight fasting for at least 12 hours, blood samples were taken and shipped via cold chain to regional central laboratories (Chengdu, Chongqing, Guiyang, and Kunming). Within 24 hours, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was tested by an MQ-6000 glycated hemoglobin analyzer (Shanghai Medconn Biotechnology Corporation); the plasma glucose and lipid profiles were tested by an AU5800 automated chemistry analyzer (Beckman Coulter Commercial Enterprise).",acf75249-ab6a-4ff2-a762-271a6b0ee1c0
12,methods10,"  According to the latest diagnostic criteria for metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) proposed by an international expert panel [4], metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in our study was defined by evidence of hepatic steatosis on ultrasound together with diabetes, overweight/obesity (i.e., body mass index (BMI) ≥23 kg/m2 for Asians), or two or more of the following metabolic risk abnormalities: waist circumference ≥90 cm in men and ≥80 cm in women; blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg; plasma triglycerides (TG) ≥1.7 mmol/l; plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) <1.0 mmol/l for men and <1.3 mmol/l for women; prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/l or hemoglobin A1c 5.7-6.4%). Note that we eliminated two metabolic conditions from the original definition since the insulinemia test and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) test was not carried out at the baseline survey.",55aa46b5-1134-426f-bea0-b13f7b9174b0
13,methods11,"  Covariates  A directed acyclic graph (directed acyclic graph (DAG)) was constructed representing the existing literature to select a minimally sufficient set of covariates to adjust for confounding, according to the protocol of “Evidence Synthesis for Constructing Directed Acyclic Graphs” (ESC-directed acyclic graph (DAG)s) [28]. The independent tests were further carried out to continuously modify the proposed directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on the directed acyclic graph (DAG), the following variables were retained as confounders in our statistical models: age, sex, urbanicity, ethnicity, marital status, highest education attained, household income, profession, regular smoking, physical activity in metabolic equivalent tasks, total energy intake, regular intake of sweeten beverage, regular intake of dietary supplements, regular intake of spicy food, regular intake of pepper food, insomnia symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, menopause status for women,",18e9d05b-d705-4c75-95be-fbb60bd4c871

Statistical analyses  Mean values and percentages of baseline characteristics were calculated for metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) status and obese status at baseline, with adjustment for age and sex by direct standardization (using the entire study sample as the standard population) as appropriate.  We used logistic regression with the inverse probability of exposure weighting (inverse probability of exposure weighting (IPEW)) to examine associations between dietary patterns and the outcome of metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), with the lowest quintile as the reference for each dietary pattern.",97110fb6-fd6a-472d-9d65-86ae4b5a7139
15,methods13," When analyzing the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, we further adjusted for alcohol intake because alcohol was not part of that score. Associations were quantified by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To test for trends, models were conducted using the median of each quintile as a continuous variable. We next performed these models separately for nonobese and obese individuals, and heterogeneity between nonobese and obese individuals was evaluated with the Cochran Q test and chi-square (χ2) test. Subsequently, to facilitate the interpretations of the association between each dietary pattern and metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), we evaluated the influence of each of the dietary components on the metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) risk by alternately subtracting one component at a time from the original score for each dietary pattern [29].",552603fb-da7f-4482-9c08-37526ce6ef75

To date, a few studies have reported that compared with the Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) criteria, the metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) criteria could identify a greater number of individuals with metabolically complicated fatty liver [36–38]. Consistent with these studies, we found that the change from Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) could identify more fatty liver individuals with obesity in our study.",f6a29f72-fa11-48af-a055-7bda98ca00cd

To our knowledge, only few studies have examined the effects of dietary patterns and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in less-developed regions. Using a factor analysis, which is an a posteriori, data-driven method to define dietary patterns, a cohort study in Tianjin of China identified 3 dietary patterns: sugar rich dietary pattern, vegetable rich dietary pattern, and animal food dietary pattern [39]. Dietary patterns rich in animal foods or sugar were associated with an increased risk of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), whereas a vegetable rich dietary pattern was not associated [39].",9ac0d309-9df7-4a47-b9d7-a3ad59a5df2c
38,discussion3," A case-control study [40] and a cross-sectional study [41] from China have also shown a positive association between animal foods pattern and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Another cross-sectional study with 1,639 participants in Shandong of China identified three a posteriori patterns, traditional Chinese, Western, and high-energy dietary patterns [42]. This study found that adherence to the western dietary pattern was associated with higher risks of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [42]. A cross-sectional study with 797 adults in China has reported that Diet Quality Index-International but not the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower prevalence of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [43]. These studies generally strengthened the importance of a healthy dietary pattern in preventing Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development or progression in less-developed regions, but the evidence considering ethnic disparities was lacking.",7818a41d-ca2d-47bf-bc32-29dc831c7f58
39,discussion4," In this study, based on a larger-scale population and focusing on areas with diverse ethnic minorities, we found it necessary to generalize a healthy dietary pattern like Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) to LEMRs.  Our findings of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) with metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) agree with previous studies investigating the association of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [44, 45]. In a randomized controlled clinical trial addressing weight loss and metabolic status among Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) participants from Iran, consumption of a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet for 8 weeks had a beneficial effect on body weight and metabolic profiles, including liver enzymes, triglycerides, insulin metabolism markers, inflammatory markers, and oxidative stress markers [44].",c8fa9252-5219-423c-b34a-5a175cf2620e
40,discussion5," However, all of the participants in that study were either overweight or obese. Recently, another Chinese study showed that adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was independently associated with a markedly lower prevalence of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in middle-aged and elderly adults [45], but body mass index (BMI) was not taken into account as a covariate or a stratification factor but a mediator in this study. Our study confirmed and refined these associations, and we focused on the phenotype of metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), especially nonobese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), showing that the protective effect of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) on nonobese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) was greater than that of obese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD).",c10ea9e9-99cb-45a9-9655-2103bafc4c7f
41,discussion6,"  In our study, we found that full-fat dairy products and sodium contributed predominantly to the association of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) with metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Although studies linking dairy products and sodium to Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are scarce, there is strong evidence regarding associations between the two components and metabolic disorders, which supports our findings. For dairy products, findings from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE)) study [46] and another Chinese cohort study [47] demonstrated that dairy consumption was associated with a significantly lower risk of diabetes and favorable changes in cardiometabolic traits, indicating that consumption of dairy products should be encouraged in less-developed countries where dairy consumption is low.",5774c0b5-f075-49eb-b7eb-e07236a6ae67
42,discussion7," Some nutrients, such as milkfat, vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and whey proteins, in dairy products may play protective roles [48]. For instance, calcium may interact with SFAs in milkfat to decrease fat absorption, lower TG concentrations, and improve the HDL-C to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ratio [49, 50]. For sodium, a significant positive association with the risk of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic syndrome was demonstrated in recent studies [51–53]. It has been proposed that high sodium intake might impair the insulin signaling step, leading to dysregulation of insulin sensitivity and increased fat buildup in the body [54]. For decades, a high level of sodium intake has remained the leading dietary risk factor for metabolic disorders in China [55].",ff6ea9d9-0df0-48db-8c32-772dd32a1082
43,discussion8," As a dietary pattern initially developed to control sodium intake, it is not surprising that there was a consistently inverse association for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) with the risk of metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in our study.  Previous studies from European countries showed greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower prevalence of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [56, 57], and a Mediterranean-style diet has been recommended for the management of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by the EASL-EASD-EASO Clinical Practice Guideline [13]. However, the effects of Mediterranean-style diets on Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or related cardiometabolic risks are still controversial, especially in non-Mediterranean regions [58, 59].",8cccba8e-c533-4bf5-b991-43992d50bf31
44,discussion9," Contrary to findings in European countries, our results did not find a significant association between a priori dietary patterns—Alternate Mediterranean diet (AMED) and metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), which was consistent with another Chinese cross-sectional study of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [43]. In our study, the MUFA:SFA ratio appeared to be the most influential component that was positively associated with metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). This may be related to a serious lack of high-quality sources of MUFAs (such as olive oil or marine fish) and the deep cooking manner in less-developed regions, which are quite different from Mediterranean regions.  Diet modification guidelines for individuals with normal body weight have been an unresolved issue in real-world clinical practice. To date, the importance of body mass index (BMI) has been demonstrated in many diet studies on hepatic steatosis [10, 56, 60].",74e41aa6-ff31-46bb-abf2-e68837ab94f4
45,discussion10," However, only a few epidemiological studies have specifically investigated the role of diet between nonobese Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and obese Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but they all focused on dietary macronutrient composition, such as protein [10] and carbohydrate [60]. Our results added to the limited number of studies that evaluated the association between diet and metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in nonobese and obese individuals and showed the importance of dietary patterns beyond the single nutrition components in nonobese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) individuals, which can facilitate adoption in both public health and clinical practice.",0873028e-03b5-44ca-b9d7-265203a3d13b
46,discussion11," In our study, we confirmed that both obese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and nonobese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) individuals could follow a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and the association was more pronounced in nonobese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) individuals.  The reason why Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) showed a more pronounced relationship with nonobese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is unclear. Based on the evidence of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), one explanation is that participants with nonobese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) could have different genetic predispositions from obese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), as with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",71b1b267-4771-4b64-8a5c-d3a466bfc350
47,discussion12," Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) is one of the most important genetic determinants of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [61], and the PNPLA3 rs738409 gene polymorphism is strongly associated with hepatic fat levels and hepatic inflammation [61]. Carriers of the PNPLA3 rs738409 G allele experience greater improvement in liver fat after lifestyle modification, with a greater reduction in blood total cholesterol, LDL-C level [62]. As a population study reported, the G allele at PNPLA3 rs738409 was more common in nonobese Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) participants than in obese Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) participants [63]. The difference in the G allele may partly explain the heterogeneity in our results between nonobese and obese individuals.  The main strength of this study is the large-scale population from LEMRs, providing a unique opportunity to examine the associations between two a priori dietary patterns (i.e.",069d33ac-9b7e-47eb-8cdb-dafa31eec8aa
48,discussion13,", a priori dietary patterns—Alternate Mediterranean diet (AMED) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) and metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) risks, particularly the associations with nonobese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) risks, in less-developed regions where nonobese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has been an increasingly concerning health issue. Furthermore, we performed analyses with the application of ESC-directed acyclic graph (DAG)s and inverse probability of exposure weighting (IPEW), which are under the framework of causal inference.  Nonetheless, some limitations need to be addressed. First, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used in our study only included 13 crude food groups, not specific food items.",c9c626cb-5f0d-47f4-8356-35462588d347
49,discussion14," The tool might be flawed, but considering that most participants from our study regions speak different local languages that need to be translated from the local translators, and consume local foods that are not found in any existing food database, the food group-based and simplified food questionnaire may be the only feasible way to collect dietary information from various ethnic regions in a large population-based study. However, it should not have a significant impact on the assessment of dietary patterns and total energy intake. By analyzing the subsample data of 24HDR, we found that the differences between the calculation of total energy intake based on crude food groups and that based on specific food items were small and roughly randomly distributed around zero. Second, although we used a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to measure dietary intake, recall bias could not be easily ruled out.",74b5e929-984b-465c-95c9-72db906d5c31
50,discussion15," Third, as most of the current measurement error correction methods are only applicable to a single food item or nutrient [64, 65], we did not correct the measurement errors in this study. Forth, in the assessment of metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), the objective indicators of insulin and hs-CRP were not available in our baseline survey for the sake of feasibility. Fifth, whereas we adjusted for a variety of confounders based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG), there might still be risk of residual confounding. Sixth, our study population only consisted of Chinese individuals, which may also limit the generalizability of our findings to other LEMRs from other parts of the world.",e93fd47b-4b72-4d47-b517-7362e23de87d
51,discussion16,"  Conclusion  In conclusion, we found that a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in LEMRs, and this relationship appeared to be more pronounced in nonobese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) individuals than in obese metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) individuals. The results of this large population-based study add to the current evidence on the importance of dietary patterns in metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), suggesting that Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is superior dietary guidance to a priori dietary patterns—Alternate Mediterranean diet (AMED) regarding reducing metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) risks in LEMRs, especially in nonobese individuals with metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD).",d9ef4b1d-7bd0-4046-a557-b77f3b22dc03
