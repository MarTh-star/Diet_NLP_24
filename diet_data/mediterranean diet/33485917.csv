0,methods0," 4.1. Plants Materials  P. oleracea (purslane) is an annual herb that has become naturalized throughout the world; it is considered a weed in some regions. The stems, leaves, and flowers are edible. It has a slightly acidic and salty taste and can be eaten fresh in salad or cooked as a leafy vegetable [76]. P. ruderale is an annual herb native to Central and South America, but is adapted to different edaphoclimatic conditions. It is known as ‘‘rupay wachi’’ and “quirquiña”, among other common names [77]. This species is a wild herb with a strong and distinctive flavor; the leaves and tender stems are commonly used for salads and spicy sauces [78]. In addition, both plants have some phytopharmaceutical properties, provided by their biologically active compounds.  The species were collected between June–July 2020 from two environments along the Valencian coast (Spain): (1) organic farming and (2) wild conditions.",60183397-8288-4bcc-99ef-91768981c118
1,methods1," Organic cultivation methods were carried out on the Unió de Llauradors i Ramaders farm, which was organic certified 18 years ago. The area is located within 39°45′13′′ North and 0°12′21′′ West, with SCI code ES0000148 [79]. The edible aerial parts such as leaves and small tender stems were separated and used for extractions and analytical quantification of bioactive compounds; methanolic extracts were prepared to determine total antioxidants, and acetone extracts to determine the chlorophyll content, as well as an aqueous extract for total polyphenols and other chemical constituents such as nitrates, pH, and total acidity. The rest of the determinations were performed with plant matter dried to a constant weight in an autoclave (J.P. Selecta) at 70 ± 0.1 °C.",510d7b85-288e-4e1b-a849-874a07c6e50b
2,methods2," The dry vegetable fraction was ground with a grinding mill (Retsch KG-5657 Haan, Remscheid, Germany) to obtain a fine powder (250 µm) and stored in high-density polyethylene bottles under refrigeration conditions at 4 °C for subsequent analysis (nutritional and mineral compositions).  4.2.

8,methods8," Chlorophylls: a, b, Total  The extraction of chlorophylls was carried out by adapting the method proposed in [85]. The ground aerial parts were suspended in pigment extraction solvent (80% acetone v/v), filtered through filter paper to avoid turbidity, and brought up to a volume of 50 mL with the same extraction solvent. Solutions were measured spectrophotometrically at 645 nm, 653 nm, and 663 nm. The results were expressed as μg·g−1 fw on a per sample basis.  4.5. Other Chemicals: Nitrates, Ph and Total Acidity  Aqueous extracts from fresh aerial parts were prepared in a 1:2 (w/v) ratio at a temperature lower than 30 °C by mechanical grinding. Nitrates (mg NO3-·kg−1 fw) and pH were measured directly by pH and ION-Meter GLP 22+ (CRISON) equipment and with the respective electrodes, after calibrating each electrode.
