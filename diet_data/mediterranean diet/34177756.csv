The number of times a given food item was consumed (per day, week, month, or year) was also asked. The quantity of the food consumed was assessed from the respondent’s selection of an image of a food portion, or using a predefined standard portion (e.g.",c0cdf524-1ca1-4701-929c-57be7aab8448

For tomatoes and other specific foods, whose intake is strongly dependent on season, intake was assessed separately in and out of the main cropping season [14]. Data from Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) were converted into frequencies of consumption and average daily quantities of foods, energy, and nutrients consumed, by linkage to specific Italian Food Tables [15].  2.3.

In this paper we investigated two a priori dietary patterns specifically developed to capture the dietary habits of Mediterranean populations, the Greek Modified Mediterranean Diet (Greek Modified Mediterranean Diet (GMMD)) and the Italian Mediterranean Diet (Italian Mediterranean Diet (IMD)) [20,21], as well as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)), which is used worldwide as a standard for good-quality diets [22].  We found that “good adherence” to Italian Mediterranean Diet (IMD) and Greek Modified Mediterranean Diet (GMMD) compared with “low adherence” was associated with significantly lower body mass index (BMI), %FM, and WC and with significantly higher MM%.",99906705-87b0-41ff-a371-0b3556ce416a

We also investigated the association between PA and body composition and found results consistent with those of several studies available in the literature: the upper tertile of recreational PA such as walking, bicycling, and swimming (with a range of 28.5 to 171.",cf6c58c3-a84c-4e2e-a514-b00ee71556a6
24,methods24,"0 metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/week), as compared to the lower tertile, was associated with lower %FM, body mass index (BMI), and WC and with higher %MM values; higher levels of sitting time were associated with higher %FM, higher body mass index (BMI) values, higher WC values, and lower %MM values.  Regarding PA, our results on sitting time are consistent with those reported in the literature. A study published in 2019 [24] reported an improvement in indices of obesity and metabolic syndrome in adults who had replaced 30 min/day in bed with 30 min/day of light or moderate PA; these results are in agreement with our results on sitting time, which was found to be directly associated with body composition indices of obesity. Sitting time is an interesting variable to evaluate in our population of old women (average age 70.3 years), a stage of life characterized by modification of physical activity patterns and a reduction of daily activities.  A study by Kyle UG et al.",f0b63a16-3363-43cc-bbab-3970cbb7b35d
25,methods25," conducted on 3853 individuals aged 15–64 years investigated the association between different levels of PA and body composition. It was seen that “physically active” people (>3 h/week of PA such as jogging, swimming, tennis, and gymnastics) had a higher percentage of lean mass than sedentary people (<3 h/week of PA), while sedentary people had higher %FM values. In addition, despite ageing, the increase in %FM was slower in “physically active” people [25].  A study conducted on men and women with an average age of 65 years showed, in participants who increased moderate-to-vigorous PA by 1 h/day, a significant inverse association with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and fat mass and a significant direct association with bone mass and lower-limb muscle strength. Participants who increased sedentary time, on the other hand, had higher fat mass and waist circumference. In this study, light physical activity was not significantly associated with any outcome [26].",66615bea-a578-4058-9398-4931f377ce20
26,methods26," Results on body mass index (BMI), WC, and fat mass agree with ours; however, in the higher tertiles of recreational physical activity, we also found a direct association with %MM.  It is well-known by now that physical activity plays a key role in maintaining good body composition and health. What is interesting to note, however, is that in our study, even a moderate physical activity done during leisure time can have beneficial effects. These are encouraging findings especially in a population in which ageing can make it more difficult to perform intense physical activity.  About dietary patterns, it is interesting to note that despite the differences in the dietary components and in the scoring systems, the results obtained in our study are consistent and almost similar for the two Mediterranean dietary patterns, while the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is not associated with body composition parameters (except for a mild inverse association with waist circumference).",5d6b135b-d7f3-445c-973c-f942b13938cc
27,methods27," The most relevant results on body composition, however, emerged from analyses with the Italian Mediterranean Diet (IMD) that specifically takes into account Italian dietary habits. Moreover, this food pattern is the only one to present “contrasting” food pairs, i.e., healthy vs. unhealthy foods (pasta-potatoes, olive oil-butter, fish-red meat), so that increased consumption of healthy foods is presumably correlated with reduced consumption of unhealthy foods. It should also be noted that the Italian Mediterranean Diet (IMD) score, by using the highest tertile of consumption for the allocation of points, allows a more efficient classification of subjects according to their food consumption.

28,methods28,"  Notably, in the frame of the Fitness League Against MENopause COst (Fitness League Against MENopause COst (FLAMENCO)) project, a cross-sectional analysis on 176 perimenopausal women aged 45–60 years and residing in southern Spain showed that a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (calculated through the Mediterranean diet score proposed by Panagiotakos et al. [27]) was associated with a high ratio of hip to total fat mass (ratio of gynoid to total FM) and a low ratio of abdominal to hip fat mass (ratio of abdominal to gynoid FM). Moreover, in this study, an inverse association emerged between whole grains, nuts, dairy products, legumes, and extra virgin olive oil intake and percent fat mass, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI). Although these results were not strictly related to food patterns, almost all of the considered foods are also included in the patterns we used.",39fa7d6a-f5c8-451e-b0c3-38b59d08da68
29,methods29,"  Similar results on the Mediterranean diet score proposed by Panagiotakos were obtained in a group of 481 postmenopausal women in a cross-sectional study in which higher levels of adherence to the dietary pattern under study were associated with lower levels of body mass index (BMI), lower levels of waist circumference, and a lower waist-to-hip ratio [28]. Another recent study by Cespedes F. et al. [29], conducted on 67175 postmenopausal women during 3 years of follow-up, suggests that adherence to a healthy dietary pattern is an optimal strategy for containing increased total and abdominal adiposity.",9387c517-7782-463a-b4dc-30df3c153c89
30,methods30," Specifically, they reported the association between improved diet quality, as assessed by greater adherence to four specific dietary patterns (Healthy Eating Index 2010, Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010, Alternate Mediterranean Diet, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)), and reduced increases in waist circumference and abdominal fat (largely explained by reduced body weight gain), even over a 3-year period.  This study has several strengths: the accurate collection of dietary data obtained through a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) specifically developed for Italian dietary habits [14,30], the direct measurement of anthropometric indices by specialized personnel following specific standardized protocols, and the possibility of adjusting models for several lifestyle variables obtained from a validated lifestyle questionnaire (LSQ).",d3d3f67d-a9cb-45df-bcf2-9d459a48be7f
31,methods31," The analysis of body composition was performed using the TANITA MC-780MA analyzer, which is considered an adequate method to assess body composition in epidemiological studies among young and middle-aged women [19,31,32].  A first limitation of the study is the cross-sectional nature that precludes the attribution of causality to the results obtained. However, we can speculate that lifestyle habits do not rapidly change in this age range. We also performed analyses adjusted for diseases reported by participants that could have affected both lifestyle habits and body composition. The results did not materially change, thus reducing the possibility of a reverse causation bias. A second limitation concerns the PA assessment method. PA was reported by participants in a section of the lifestyle questionnaire (LSQ) and was not objectively measured as in other studies. However, we were able to rely on highly detailed, validated questionnaires [16].",a70aea41-fcbd-48af-b973-7a99ac4f81a3
32,methods32," In our analysis, we did not use visceral fat measurement obtained by TANITA as an outcome of body composition. This decision was driven by the fact that the visceral fat mass, differently by %FM and %MM, was not measured but estimated by the TANITA instrument with an indirect algorithm. The increase in visceral fat attributable to menopause is, however, a very interesting topic on which studies are not yet clear and concordant. For example, a study by Cespedes F. et al. found that adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was correlated with lower values of visceral fat [29], while a study published in 2018 conducted on overweight women and men found no association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and visceral fat [24].

In this study, we confirm that dietary habits and physical activity play a central role in maintaining good health even in menopausal women.",60042587-1900-4d0a-aca0-e1ed7415192f
