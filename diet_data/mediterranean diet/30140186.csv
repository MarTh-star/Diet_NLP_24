0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design and Participants  The and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) study design, protocol, and methodology have been described in detail elsewhere [14]. Briefly, it is a cross-sectional study conducted using multistage stratified sampling. The fieldwork was performed at 128 sampling points across Spain. The sample consisted of 2285 participants aged 9–75 years (1160 men and 1125 women), of which 2009 were randomly selected (1013 men, 996 women), and 176 participants came from a “booster sample” to provide at least 200 individuals for the youngest (9–12, 13–17, and 18–24 years) and oldest (65–75 years) age groups. The sample quotas were distributed by age, sex, geographical distribution, and locality size [14,15]. In addition, other data related to factors such as the unemployment rate, the percentage of non-Spanish subjects, physical activity level, and education and income levels were collected.  2.2.",dacf62ef-816d-47cd-8ec1-7ee00c848bea
1,methods1," Dietary Data Collection The availability of detailed, harmonized, and high-quality food consumption data for use in dietary exposure assessments is a long-term objective of European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA). The 2014 updated guidance document covers the EU’s Menu methodology and therefore facilitates the collection of more harmonized food consumption data from all EU Member States [16]. Briefly, for the 24 h dietary recall (24HR), a computer-assisted personal or telephone interview (CAPI/CATI) method should be used, and the reported foods should be described in accordance with the European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) FoodEx2 food classification system. Indeed, study participants were provided with a tablet device (Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea) to register their food consumption over the course of three days [14].",e8037463-797d-46c2-a7da-4a44bd0509e1
2,methods2," Participants that were unable to use the tablet device were offered other options, such as using a digital camera, a paper record, or telephone interviews. Reported intakes for food, beverages, and energy and nutrients were calculated from food consumption records using the VD-Foundation (FEN) 2.1 software, a Dietary Evaluation Program from the Spanish Nutrition Foundation (Foundation (FEN)). The program was newly developed for the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) study by the Foundation (FEN) and is based mainly on Spanish food composition tables [17]. Data obtained from food manufacturers and nutritional information provided on food labels were also included. A photographic food atlas was used to assist in assigning gram weights to portion sizes [15].   Physical activity was also assessed during interviews with the international physical activity questionnaire (international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ)).",74b7cd51-e4d4-419e-991e-75d4587554cb
3,methods3," For a 10% subsample, physical activity was also determined using accelerometers. The details are published elsewhere [18].  2.3. Adequacy of Reported Intake  The average requirements (ARs) published by the European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA), according to age and sex cut-points, were applied to estimate the prevalence of adequate protein, calcium, iron, zinc, folate, vitamin C, and vitamin A intake [9]. The AR is the level of nutrient intake that is adequate for half of the people in a population group, given a normal distribution of requirements [9]. When there is no population reference intake (population reference intake (PRI)) to establish it, adequate intake (AI) is used instead [9]. AI is the observed daily average intake by a population group (or groups) of apparently healthy people that is assumed to be adequate. In the case of fiber, we compared the reported intake with the European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA)’s AI.",81bcba0f-71d7-4a89-957c-dc223eb52fdf
4,methods4," For lipids and sugars, we followed the Food and Agriculture Organization (Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)) Fats and Fatty Acids in Human Nutrition Report recommendations [19] and the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO))’s guidelines [20], respectively.   2.4. Diet Quality Scores The four previously developed diet quality index (DQI)s calculated were Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) [21], Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) [22], Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)-mod [23], and the MED-diet quality index (DQI) [24]. Children and adolescents were excluded from this analysis, as the diet quality index (DQI) scores used in the present work were defined for adult populations. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of each score.  2.4.1.",dbef6a29-5654-4ddf-87e0-8efaa6ace957
5,methods5," Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) The Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) was selected because it has been used in many studies worldwide to evaluate dietary patterns using the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the prevention of chronic diseases. A dichotomous variable was generated for each food group or nutrient that was included in these guidelines. If a person’s intake was within the recommended range, this variable was coded as 1. Otherwise, it was coded as 0. The Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) was the sum of all these dichotomous variables, including SFAs, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), cholesterol, protein, complex carbohydrates, monosaccharides and disaccharides, dietary fiber, fruits and vegetables, pulses, nuts, and seeds [21]. For the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI), the cut-off values were <3, 3–4, and >4, categorized as low, medium, and high, respectively.  2.4.2.",24de05b3-a1ef-47c0-8f5c-2e3348928437
6,methods6," Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) The traditional Mediterranean diet has been defined and reasonably scored in terms of eight component characteristics: A high monounsaturated to saturated fat ratio, moderate ethanol consumption, high consumption of legumes, high consumption of cereals (including bread and potatoes), high consumption of fruits, high consumption of vegetables, low consumption of meat and meat products, and low consumption of milk and dairy products [22]. A value of 0 or 1 was assigned to each of eight components with the use of the sex-specific median as the cut-off, total range 0–8. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) cut-off was 4. Scores <4 were classified as low and those ≥4 as high.  2.4.3. Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)-Mod This score is a revised scale of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), including fish intake as part of the degree of adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet [23].",52c20a2b-595d-4048-983f-3912d088662e
7,methods7," A value of 0 or 1 was assigned to each of nine components with the use of the sex-specific median as the cut-off, total range 0–9. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)-mod cut-off values were <4, 4–5, and >6, corresponding to low, medium, and high diet quality, respectively.  2.4.4. MED-diet quality index (DQI) This index includes the intake of SFAs and cholesterol and the consumption of meats, olive oil, fish, cereals, and vegetables plus fruits [24]. Each nutrient or food group was assigned three scores (0, 1, and 2) on the basis of the recommended guidelines, where such guidelines exist (cholesterol, SFA), or by dividing the population’s consumption into tertiles, where there was no specific recommendation for the food [5,24]. The MED-diet quality index (DQI) scores were totaled as follows: Good, 1–4; medium–good, 5–7; medium–poor, 8–10; poor, 11–14.   2.5.",8978bda0-dc98-433c-8d72-e256471ee124
8,methods8," and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI) A group of critical nutrients related to diet, namely proteins, total fat, SFAs, PUFAs, simple sugars (including sugars naturally found in foods and added sugars), fiber, calcium, iron, zinc, folate, vitamin C, and vitamin A, were initially considered to evaluate whether their intakes were adequate on a population level. Later, a selected group of those nutrients (i.e., total fat, SFAs, simple sugars, fiber, calcium, vitamin C, and vitamin A) were grouped to create the “and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI)”, potentially applicable to any EU population. Iron was not included, as the majority of the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) population had an adequate intake of this micronutrient. Folate was not included, as its intake exhibited a high co-linearity with both vitamin C and fiber.",30fb686c-75e7-43b0-880a-e5b7825f648d
9,methods9," Finally, zinc was not included, as the database food composition used in the present study lacks some data for this micronutrient in various foods usually consumed by adults.   Each of the criteria was scored as either 0 (not compliant) or 1 (compliant) based on the European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) dietary reference for nutrients [9], the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Fats and Fatty Acids in Human Nutrition Report recommendations for lipids [19], and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for sugars [20]. The and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI) ranged from 0 to 7. Cut-off values were <3, ≥3 to <5, and >5: low, moderate, and good, respectively. The criteria to score either 0 or 1 for each component are shown in Table 2.   2.6.",778767ac-ad4d-43ce-aaf1-e67333ff1a9d
10,methods10," Covariates Participants were categorized according to primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education based on the International Standard Classification of Education (International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)) scale [25]. The income of participants was grouped in three categories: <1000, 1000–2000, and >2000 Euros/month, corresponding to low medium, and high income, respectively.  2.7. Misreporting The methodology used in the evaluation of misreporting for the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) population has been reported previously [13]. Briefly, the European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) protocol to calculate misreporting was followed [12]. This protocol is mainly based on the studies of Goldberg [26] and Black [27,28]. This method compares the reported energy intake (EIrep) with the presumed energy expenditure. EIrep is expressed as a multiple of the estimated mean basal metabolic rate (BMRest).",a38c1978-8828-4014-994f-65ff1e7f17a9
11,methods11," Then, the ratio EIrep:BMRest is referred to as the physical activity level (physical activity level (PAL)) [12]. The physical activity level (PAL) is established for youth (≤17 years) and adults (18-65 years) in three levels: Low (1.6 and 1.4), moderate (1.8 and 1.6), and vigorous (2.0 and 1.8). Additionally, the protocol indicates that analyses should be done at two levels: Group and individual. The group level determines the overall bias to the reported EI, and the individual level shows the rate of under and over reporters. We calculated the BMRest using the Schöfield equations [29]. Misreporting cut-offs at the group and individual levels for the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) study have been previously reported [13]. Briefly, the percentages of plausible reporters by age groups were adults (26%) and older adults (22%).   As mentioned earlier in Section 2.",d8bc541b-a01f-4fc4-a6dc-791ef1125803
12,methods12,"4, in the present study, we excluded children and adolescents not because the ratio EIrep:BMRest referred to as the physical activity level (PAL) cannot be calculated for those groups but because the diet quality index (DQI) scores were defined for adult populations.  2.8. Statistical Analysis  To evaluate the adequacy of the reported nutrient intake, we compared the so called “usual intake” with the AR or AI, published by European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) according to age and sex. Since we average the intake of a small number of days of 24HR (observed intakes; i.e., 3 non-consecutive days in the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) study do not adequately reflect the usual intake), it is necessary to statistically model the dietary data to eliminate day-to-day variation in food consumption.",e47ef2c4-72b8-4bc5-b7e3-76e9d2bcf883
13,methods13," Thus, the usual intake distribution was estimated from the observed daily intake, applying a statistical age-dependent correction for the intra-individual (day-to-day) variation [30] using SPADE (Statistical Program to Assess Dietary Exposure, RIVM, Amsterdam, Nederlands) [31]. Briefly, this program estimates the percentiles of habitual nutrient intake distributions and the proportions above or below the defined AR or AI cut-off values. The interview day (day 1, day 2, or day 3), the day of the week, the season, and the sample weighting factor are considered in the adjustment of dietary data, stratified by sex and age group.   The chi-squared test was used to estimate differences in the percentages of subjects classified into categories according to the cut-off values for each diet quality index (DQI).  Kendall’s Tau rank correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the potential association of each diet quality index (DQI) score to education and income levels and their interactions.",c746e240-cdf7-410e-89b6-2391bf632d83
14,methods14," Given that diet quality index (DQI) scores differed by the number of point-scale (i.e., for Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI), low, medium, and high; for Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), low and high; for Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)-mod, low, medium, and high; for MED-diet quality index (DQI), poor, medium-poor, medium-good, and good; and for and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI), low, medium, and high), the model of analysis was based on a non-square contingency table. Indeed, for the analysis of data, we used Tau-c rank correlation coefficient statistics.   To estimate the specific effects of the covariates “education” and “income level” (ordinal independent variables) on the degree of diet quality (i.e.",77204e01-85f2-4d92-baaf-32b4c2d61a98

The estimated parameters are the exponential values of the regression coefficient (x), which give the probability for the association of specific diet quality index (DQI) categories with a particular education or income level. That is to say, the exponential e−x indicates the probability of significant effects of the covariates on different categories (e.g., low, medium, and high for each of the diet quality index (DQI)s). A p-value <0.05 was considered significant.  3. Results 3.1.",c4762b01-a023-4cbc-b177-148db8c17ea2

About 14.8% of the older adults did not reach the AR of proteins, whereas the rest of the population mostly complied with the European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) AR. With regards to fatty acids, intake of PUFA was within the range of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommendations for about 75% of the whole population, whereas saturated fatty acid intake was over the maximum recommendation for more than 50% of the population, being the largest for children (80.6%) and adolescents (76.5%). The intake of simple sugars was higher than the recommended AR (87% for adults to about 93% for children).",8d656dfe-a41b-448c-b344-b75c475a0e97
17,methods17," Likewise, a high percentage of the population had a low intake of dietary fiber (85–99% of the AI recommended by European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA)). About one half of children exhibited a low intake of calcium, reaching 75.4% in adolescents. Intermediate values were observed for adults and older adults (65–68%). However, the intake of iron was close to the AR for the majority of the population (95–98%). With respect to zinc, 31.3% of the children and 76.9% of the adolescents did not comply with the European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) AR recommendations. Data for zinc intake in adults and older adults were not included, as the database food composition used in the present study lacked some data for this micronutrient in various foods regularly consumed by the adult population. Regarding folate intake, a high percentage of the population did not reach the AR (mainly adolescents, adults, and older adults (81.8–88.3%)).",4e876e49-9769-443f-af2e-c68d3704082b
18,methods18," The intakes of vitamin C and vitamin A exhibited similar patterns, particularly in adolescents and adults (close to 50% AR).  3.2. Diet Quality Indexes Table 4 shows the diet quality index (DQI) scores classified according to the cut-off values for the whole and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) population, adults (18–64 years), and older adults (65–75 years) by sex. About 60.2% of adults and 49.0% of older adults had a low Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI). However, about 10.2% of older adults exhibited a high diet quality index (DQI) compared with only 4.8% of adults. No major differences were found between men and women.  With regards to the Mediterranean dietary adherence evaluated by Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), 47.4% of adults and 23.8% of older adults had a low score. A similar pattern was found when Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)-mod was used. However, the absolute values were lower compared to Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (35.5% for adults vs. 14.6% for older adults).",39af357a-5c69-4972-b856-c9a9ac710067

Likewise, we built a novel index, the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI), based on the adequacy of compliance to the current World Health Organization (WHO)/Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) guidelines for total fat and fatty acids [19], the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for sugar intake [20], and the European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) recommended intakes for fiber, vitamin C, vitamin A, zinc, and calcium [9].

It is globally recognized as a healthy dietary model and an intangible cultural heritage of humanity by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)) [32]. Food consumption patterns in Spain and energy and nutrient intakes have changed markedly in the last forty years, differing somewhat at present from the traditional and healthy Mediterranean Diet. This change is partly due to the westernization of eating habits [33,34,35].",e25b647d-0c52-4dce-8d28-0c7cf6779ac2
27,methods27,"  The detailed analysis of the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) population, with regard to the recommended intakes for the nutrients included in the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI), shows that, except for protein, PUFA, and iron, the Spanish population have higher intakes of SFA, simple sugars, and low intakes of fiber, calcium, zinc, folate, and vitamins A and C than recommended. Overall, older adults showed better diet quality index (DQI)s than adults, with no major differences found between men and women, although the percentages of women with a low-quality score were slightly lower than those for men. Regarding the association of diet quality index (DQI)s with education and income, in general, education level had a strong influence on the quality of the diet, although Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) did not discriminate between different levels of education.",55e1cf4e-40ea-4577-812d-246454245de7
28,methods28," Globally, lower education levels were related to lower quality scores for the Mediterranean diet quality indexes, regardless of the analyzed diet quality index (DQI). Nonetheless, using the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) score, we observed a lower score for those with low income.   When comparing the diet quality index (DQI)s for the general population and plausible reporters, we observed similar percentages for low, medium, and high scores, except for the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI), for which the percentages of the low-quality score were higher, and those with higher quality scores were lower in plausible reporters. The differences found in the percentages of the population with low quality scores for the analyzed diet quality index (DQI)s could be due (at least in part) to the special particularities of the Spanish and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) population.",49d7167b-f662-4321-975d-019ef4780d7d
29,methods29," In fact, most of the diet quality index (DQI)s have been designed for specific populations [5]. Indeed, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)-mod, and MED, which measure the adherence to the Mediterranean diet, exhibited lower percentages of low-quality scores compared to the indexes potentially applicable to general populations, such as Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) and and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI). Some authors have reported that certain diet quality index (DQI)s built for specific populations lead to lower quality indexes when adapted to others with different food patterns [5]. We also observed that a higher percentage of the population (approximately 70%) had a low-quality diet when using the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI), compared to approximately 60% for the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI).",8ed04080-763d-4913-ad70-f4e390e07828
30,methods30," This difference might be attributable to the fact that Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) is a mixed quality diet index based on the consumption of specific groups of foods and the adequacy of the intake of selected nutrients, whereas the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI) takes into account, exclusively, the adequacy of the intake of a number of critical nutrients compared to EU reference nutrient intakes. Therefore, it seems crucial when using diet quality index (DQI)s to consider their specific purposes, for example, whether they are used for the evaluation of dietary intakes and food patterns, the development of dietary guidelines for specific populations, or the prevention of NCDs. In fact, we have previously pointed out that there is no standardized approach to the components of diet quality index (DQI)s and scoring, as the latter is based on food frequency, number of portions, assigned food weights, compliance with nutrient recommendations, etc.",08df6f92-2584-467f-80be-264d38c76c5f
31,methods31," It is difficult to compare diet quality index (DQI) scores, which are often country-specific [5]. Nevertheless, in the present study, we tried to compare whether internationally recognized diet quality index (DQI)s exhibited a similar behavior for the Spanish population.   When Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)-mod, and MED were compared with the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI), we observed that the latter, built on nutrients exclusively, was more strict when scoring diet quality than those based on nutrients and foods. Whatever the case, it seems that the inclusion of the consumption of foods in diet quality index (DQI)s beyond the selected critical nutrients contributes to improving the results of the quality assessment of diet in most of populations [5]. In these cases, it is very important to select and validate an appropriate method for the evaluation of food consumption (e.g.",da48690a-28d1-40d6-a3c0-fb85b0a2dc38
32,methods32,", a quantitative FFQ), as well as to use a data base of quality for the composition of foods.   Recently, the memory-based dietary assessment methods utilized in epidemiological research related to food group consumption and major events of disease have been challenged due to the varied precision and accuracy of self-reported data [36,37,38]. Archer et al. [11,36,38] empirically refuted memory-based dietary assessment methods (M-BM), such as food records, food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), and 24HR, arguing that the errors associated with M-BM-data are unquantifiable, as they are prone to omissions, false memories, intentional misreporting (i.e., lying), and gross misestimations. In particular, FFQs are prone to measurement error [39]. However, other investigators strongly disagree with the assertions made by those authors regarding the validity and usefulness of FFQs and other M-BM in assessing diet–disease relationships in epidemiologic studies.",562b8f04-ed7d-4d0d-9b69-323e98e44183
33,methods33," Indeed, Martin Calvo and Martinez-Gonzalez [40] emphasized that the growing evidence regarding diet–disease relationships found in observational studies based on M-BM is sufficiently reliable to be used for public health policies. In addition, well-controlled prospective studies using objective biomarkers of intake have confirmed the results of previous studies using self-reported dietary assessment methods. Regardless of this debate, it seems that to compare diverse diet quality index (DQI)s for different populations, the methods of dietary assessment and databases for food composition would need to be harmonized. We do not think one unique central data database should be chosen, but instead that each data base for particular countries should be harmonized and based on the same methodology to help reduce the variability.",de2c6fc0-9566-4147-8b08-bbcbb67ffa6b
34,methods34," In that respect, the European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) has given specific guidelines to facilitate the collection of food consumption data from all EU Member States [16].   In the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) study, diet was evaluated throughout a three-day dietary record using a tablet device and digital cameras to collect the information, accompanied by a 24HR [14,15]. Moreover, a group of experts supervised the trained personnel to minimize all the possible issues that could potentially appear during the data collection process. However, we are aware that there are aspects that we cannot control, such as the accuracy of memory when recording the past eating and drinking behaviors of the volunteers, which are subject to intentional or unintentional distortion factors, the will of individuals to be truthful in their responses, or the fact that the participants want to be seen as having good and healthy eating habits.",a06695de-7a52-48cd-a75f-f95e975957ea
35,methods35," However, as far as we know, to date, there are no alternative standardized methods to avoid those issues in nutrition epidemiological studies. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, we followed the guidance on the EU Menu methodology, as published by the European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA). This guidance is compulsory for new nutrition epidemiological studies carried out by EU members from 2014 onwards [16]. In addition, we addressed misreporting via a standardized European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) protocol [12], whereas most epidemiologic studies either ignore misreporting entirely or use inappropriate cut-offs. Therefore, the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) study stands well above many other previous studies on diet quality.",b45e5e73-7ec0-4a59-8462-830f6a33c51c
36,methods36,"   One main observation in the present study is that older adults had a better diet quality than adults, which was consistently seen when using not only Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) and and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI) but also Mediterranean scores. This finding agrees with other reports in Italy [41,42], Greece, and Cyprus [43]. In addition, in other countries like Canada and the USA, using general diet quality index (DQI)s, older adults exhibited better diet quality scores than their younger counterparts [8,44]. Thus, North American older adults have higher diet quality scores than adults and youth. However, other factors involved in the socioeconomic status, which may affect the diet quality of the older adults, should be considered.",100ff041-14aa-490c-b8d6-54f8681a06c7
37,methods37," The quality of diet has been related to the socioeconomic status in different populations throughout the world [44,45,46,47], which includes many variables, such as education, income, type of employment, and some characteristics of the particular areas where the populations live. However, there is no unanimity as to how education or the income levels affect diet quality. In the present study, both low education and low income were directly associated with some diet quality index (DQI)s, namely the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI). Similarly, in a French population, low education was associated with a low-quality diet, characterized by lower intakes of fiber, minerals, and vitamins, although the authors identified very complex interactions among education, income, and occupation (e.g., they described interactions between education and income level) [45].",54298416-bc95-4853-a48e-7b85d7494e8c
38,methods38,"   There is a need for more studies to evaluate the relationships between diet quality and socioeconomic status at the domestic level, as diet quality may be influenced by other factors (e.g., the target population, unemployment, the occupation of different members of the family, access to food, urbanization in countries with low or high gross domestic products) [48]. In the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) study, unemployed subjects were included, but we did not gather information about household sizes or single living arrangements. Indeed, we cannot determine the influence of these variables on diet quality.   The percentages of plausible reporters are essential to determine diet quality for a particular population. In the present study, we found differences between the whole population and the plausible reporters only for the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI) but not for the other diet quality index (DQI)s.",7cecbca4-0ae5-4b8f-a5ce-f5a361ff888b
39,methods39," The influence of misreporting (over- and underreporting) on diet quality has been scarcely considered. Lutomski et al. (2009) observed that under-reporters had a lower diet quality (evaluated by Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) diet) with a higher nutrient density and a lower percentage of energy derived from fat, whereas over-reporters showed an opposite pattern [48]. The and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) study is the only work that has analyzed misreporting in a Spanish population and considered to what extent misreporting could affect diet quality. Thus, it seems that underreporting contributes to increasing the “apparent” percentage of the general population with a low-quality diet. Other factors, including sex, BMI, and education, may also affect the percentages of over and under reporters. However, this difference was not addressed in the present study.  The present study has a number of strengths.",1ef24833-f2b1-440d-8b37-c33e846e5dde
40,methods40," Basically, we followed a standardized methodology for the study of nutrient intakes, as well as for the evaluation of misreporting based on European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) guidelines [9,12,16]. In addition, to study diet quality, we applied selected diet quality index (DQI)s that have been validated for global populations, as well as for countries following the Mediterranean pattern [5,21,22,23,24,33]. Moreover, we provided the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI) to evaluate the quality of the diet using cut-off values related to the ARs for the EU. However, this study also has limitations. The first limitation is derived of the use of 24HR, which can contribute to unquantifiable errors, as detailed above, although the use of the CAPI/CATI European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) methodology would minimize these potential errors [16]. Additional limitations are that there is no gold standard diet quality index (DQI) to compare against other indexes.",77d132c5-a40d-484c-b5ca-bf8715f1d03e
41,methods41," Likewise, it is difficult to compare diet qualities among EU countries from different surveys because of random and systemic errors of diet assessments, due to chronological changes, response rate and linguistic and cultural diversity. Moreover, as previously mentioned, we only stratified diet quality index (DQI)s by sex, education, and income, but we did not evaluate other potential factors (e.g., the body mass index of individuals, family size, type of job, unemployment, urbanization, living in rural areas) that could act as effect modifiers.  5. Conclusions and Future Research A high percentage of individuals for the Spanish and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) population exhibited elevated intakes of SFA and sugars and did not reach the EU nutrient requirements for some important nutrients like fiber, calcium, zinc, folate, and vitamins A and C.",148ba232-9a1f-4e72-93b5-6b6833640f6c
42,methods42," Moreover, low education and low income were associated with low diet quality index (DQI)s, and those socioeconomic determinants interacted to produce a lower diet quality. Additionally, the misreported evaluation in the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES) population reveals the need to routinely include this analysis in nutrition surveys to give more precise and accurate data related to nutrient intake and diet quality.   Future research is needed not only in Spain but also in other EU countries to evaluate changes in diet quality in longitudinal, long-term, and well-designed studies with appropriate sizes and regional distribution using the European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) standardized methodology. In this regard, the use of the and Energy Balance Study” (ANIBES)-diet quality index (DQI) may help compare diet quality in EU countries.",19d71899-d1e4-4e8a-84f3-0cd16e79e6c4
43,methods43," Furthermore, a deep evaluation of how socioeconomic determinants can affect the diet quality may help in the development of appropriate food and nutrition intervention policies at the regional, country, and global EU levels.  ",33d77a21-0e45-4fad-94b0-210b1d6905f9
