0,methods0," The RISMeD study (Randomized Interventional Study on Mediterranean Diet) was a single center, controlled, open-label, laboratory-blinded, randomized intervention study carried out between 2015 and 2018. Briefly, the study involved the recruitment of 130 Caucasian patients of Italian origin, aged between 30 and 75 years, identified among those admitted to the Center for programmed percutaneous coronary revascularization. Patients were contacted during hospitalization, informed about the study and enquired about their willingness to take part. The patients were pre-screened to assess their eligibility.",4d46f98e-d2dc-44a2-bf66-fda7d98af18e
1,methods1," Exclusion criteria were a history of diabetes, food allergies or intolerances, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) below 19 or above 33, intake of any drug or food supplement containing probiotics, n−3 FA or antioxidants (medications of other types in any number and dose were allowed) or any condition that, at the discretion of the researcher, might have hampered the patients’ adherence to the diet or to the schedule of visits. The patients were interrogated at prescreening about their usual eating habits by administrating the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MeDAS) questionnaire [17] and only those candidates with a MeDAS score at baseline ≤10 (out of a maximal score of 14) were included in the study to improve the chance of achieving measurable effects with the nutritional intervention.  Eligible candidates were enrolled about 2 months after the coronary revascularization procedure (T0).",87d82d42-d97a-493d-aefa-0b523c147f04
2,methods2," After signing the study informed consent, a complete clinical history was obtained (including detailed data on life-style habits and intake of medicines) and fasting peripheral venous blood was collected to determine FA composition in whole blood using gas chromatography, as described in Marangoni et al. [18]. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to a MD (n = 64) or to a standard low fat diet (LFD) (control diet, n = 66), using a blocked randomization scheme (block size of six) (Figure 1). Patients randomized to the MD received a personalized dietary plan advice including on average: fish at least 3 times a week, legumes 2–3 times a week, raw or cooked vegetables 2 times a day, fruit 3 times a day, nuts 2–3 times a week, extra virgin olive oil 30–40 milliliters a day, not more than 150 g a week of red meat, red wine during meal: 1–2 glasses a day for men, 1 glass a day for women (only for subjects that usually drink wine, not for teetotalers).",88f360de-bd13-4895-ad5c-cddfbee94e6c
3,methods3," The consumption of cold cuts, sweets and soft drinks, butter, and full fat cheeses was discouraged. The control group received low fat diet (LFD)—as recommended by cardiovascular prevention guidelines in force at the time of enrolment—which was high in vegetables, fruit and whole grains, and low in saturated fat (<10% of total caloric intake) and trans unsaturated fats [19]. The two dietary interventions mainly differed in the higher quantities of fish, legumes, and nuts in MD than in low fat diet (LFD).  In both groups, the diets were organized in seven days and personalized in terms of total calories to reduce weight in patients with body mass index (BMI) > 25 or to maintain weight otherwise. All the diets were developed with the software “Terapia Alimentare” of DS Medica Milan, Italy.  Patients carried out monthly visits (T1, T2 and T3). At each time, a nutritionist reinforced the individualized dietary recommendations.",236f3651-65bd-428f-94d8-94b93072deda
4,methods4," At T3, venous blood was collected for analysis of blood FA composition as at baseline, and the level of dietary Mediterranean-ness reached with the nutritional interventions was evaluated using the MeDAS score.  As the average baseline Italian’s dietary Mediterranean-ness is already at least moderate and the MD and low fat diet (LFD) partly overlap in terms of food types, the score was administered to both groups to detect even subtle changes in dietary Mediterranean-ness.  The present study was conducted in accordance with the European Union’s Good Clinical Practice Standards and the Helsinki Declaration. The study was approved by the Review Board and the Ethics Committee of the hospital.  This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov: identifier no. NCT02578329; this paper describes the results regarding the primary endpoint of the study.  Statistical Analysis  A total sample size of 120 subjects provided an estimated 80% statistical power to detect as significant (p < 0.",04e21a23-3888-46a1-a37f-96000089cbbb
5,methods5,"05) a between group difference of at least 0.52 standard deviations; for instance, considering the variations reported in Mayneris-Perxachs, 2014 [15], the minimum detectable difference in palmitic acid variation was estimated as 1.33%.  Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation and were compared using the t-test for independent samples. Blood FA at T0 and T3 were compared using the paired Student T-Test. Categorical data were compared using the chi-squared test. Associations between variables were determined using Spearman’s rank correlation. A two-sided p-value less than 0.05 was required for statistical significance. All analyses were performed using the SAS statistical package V.9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).  3. Results  The flow chart of the study is shown in Figure 1. At T0, 130 patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to MD (MD group, n = 64) or low fat diet (LFD) (low fat diet (LFD) group, n = 66).",920a1dd5-35d7-4e71-b9a9-f932ab276e7a
6,methods6," There were six dropouts in the MD group and four dropouts in the low fat diet (LFD) group throughout the study. Thus, 120 patients completed the three months dietary intervention (58 MD, 62 low fat diet (LFD)).  The baseline characteristics of study participants, stratified by group, are shown in Table 1. As expected for a sample of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), there was a predominance of males. The mean age was 62.2 years. The vast majority was on treatment with several cardiovascular drugs. On average, participants were overweight and had a fairly well controlled blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol and glycaemia. The groups were well balanced, with the exception of significantly lower levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in the low fat diet (LFD) group (possibly in relationship with a significant higher intake of lipid-lowering drugs). There were no differences in terms of baseline eating habits or MeDAS score between the two groups.",e8f33274-3ca1-45cb-8702-3abcf397990c
7,methods7,"  Table 2 shows data on diet mediterranean-ness (MeDAS score) and levels of blood FA of patients, stratified by treatment arm, at baseline (T0), at three months of intervention (T3) as well as their changes after the intervention (T3-T0). The MeDAS score significantly augmented by 2.6 points (±2.2) and by 1.0 point (±1.8) in the MD and low fat diet (LFD) groups, respec-tively (both p < 0.0001), though these changes were significantly larger in the MD group than in the low fat diet (LFD) group (p < 0.0001).  Both diets significantly reduced whole blood SFA and specific SFA species (18:0 and 20:0). A reduction of palmitic acid (16:0) was observed with both diets, but reached statistical significance only with MD. However, none of these effects differed between diet groups.  Total MUFA and some MUFA species (oleic acid and 24:1) augmented whereas palmitoleic acid diminished with low fat diet (LFD) but none of these changes was observed with MD.",48a3413a-ffed-4fc0-9a93-8cf1c8c0e029
8,methods8," However, the changes did not differ between groups.  Total Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as well as total n−6 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) significantly increased in the MD group but not in the low fat diet (LFD) group. However, these changes did not differ significantly between groups. The single n−6 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) differently influenced by the diets was arachidonic acid (AA), which augmented with MD but not with low fat diet (LFD).  Conversely, total n−3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) tended to augment with MD and to diminish with low fat diet (LFD), with a statistically significant difference between groups. In line with these findings, eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) plus docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) significantly increased in the MD group but did not change in the low fat diet (LFD) group, an effect significantly different between groups.",72aaff9c-a90a-4819-bb7c-34115ff739d7
9,methods9," Finally, the ratio n−6/n−3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) tended to decrease with MD and to increase with low fat diet (LFD), with a significant difference between groups. For the sake of completeness, the table describes changes induced by both diets on other minor individual FA.  Figure 2 shows correlations between dietary Mediterranean-ness achieved at T3 and blood FA species, in the whole cohort regardless of group assignment. MeDAS significantly and positively correlated with the relative concentrations of total n−3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and negatively correlated with those of the more prevalent SFA (palmitic acid), the monounsaturated palmitoleic acid, some minor long-chain n−6 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (22:4n−6 and 22:5n−6) and the ratio n−6/n−3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).",c1a0d14d-bf38-4af0-9f63-a65115aa1dc8
10,methods10," For completeness, the figure also describes significant correlations between MeDAS and other minor FA species, including a positive correlation with the SFA 20:0. Correlations between each of the 14-item of MeDAS score achieved at T3 and blood FA species are illustrated in Supplemental Table S1.  4. Discussion  This study shows that, in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), diet Mediterranean-ness exerts some distinctive favorable effects on the blood FA profile beyond those that may be obtained with a “prudent” low fat diet (LFD). Though the magnitude of dietary-induced changes in the distribution of individual FA in blood is relatively small, it is in line with that observed in previous studies [15,20].",6f28e297-3b99-4c54-9de2-cc0d2144ad43
11,methods11," Both diets reduced total SFA, and particularly palmitic acid (16:0) (borderline change with low fat diet (LFD)), which is the most abundant blood SFA and that which accounted for the major difference in terms of blood SFAs between patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and healthy subjects in case-control studies [12,13,21,22]. Noteworthily, we found that the higher the Mediterranean-ness of the diet adopted by the participants, the lower the blood palmitic acid achieved. Additionally, MeDAS positively correlated with the relative percentage of the very long chain SFA 20:0, which was associated with protection against cardiovascular disease (CVD) in some studies [23]. Therefore, in terms of blood SFAs, diet Mediterranean-ness is linked with putatively positive metabolic effects that may add to those obtained just with an low fat diet (LFD).",9a01a5d7-d4db-4fe4-bfe9-733f1b979345
12,methods12,"  The role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) of total MUFA and oleic acid, which is the most abundant MUFA species in blood, remains highly controversial [24,25] and, therefore, the clinical relevance of dietary-induced changes in these FA species are highly speculative. In this study, the low fat diet (LFD) produced a significant increase in total MUFA and variable changes in specific MUFA species, but these effects did not differ significantly between groups. Yet, levels of palmitoleic acid after three months of dieting were inversely correlated with MeDAS. This observation might be meaningful, as several pieces of evidence indicate that palmitoleic acid—which is downstream to palmitic acid in the pathway of de novo lipogenesis—is associated with several CV risk factors such as hepatic steatosis, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes as well as with cardiovascular disease (CVD) [26].",05d731d1-7d03-4675-afd5-1b908a65b8cd
13,methods13,"  Previous reports have shown that total Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as well as total n−6 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are lower in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) than in healthy controls [12,13]. In this study, total Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and n−6 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) similarly increased with both dietary interventions. The observed increase in the relative concentration of AA with MD (but not with low fat diet (LFD)) might theoretically be detrimental, as AA is the substrate of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids with atherogenic/thrombogenic effects [27]. However, the relationship between AA levels and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is highly controversial, with direct [12], null [22,28] or even inverse associations [13,29,30].",ef291292-a31a-455f-9a5c-2ef257d3fac9
14,methods14,"  The dietary interventions produced opposite changes in total n−3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which significantly increased with MD and did not change or even diminished with low fat diet (LFD). In addition, the achieved MeDAS score directly correlated with levels of total n−3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are considered protective against cardiovascular disease (CVD) [31,32,33,34]. Although in the present study FA were determined in whole blood, previous studies show that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in whole blood highly correlates with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in erythrocytes [r(2) = 0.79], namely the omega−3 index [35], which has been proposed as a potential marker of cardiovascular health [36].",461348ab-8710-4bed-8ed6-bc09b99c476a
15,methods15," The mean level of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in whole blood achieved with MD was 3.94%, corresponding to an omega−3 Index of about 5% [35], which is above the values (<4%) formerly associated with the highest risk of death from coronary heart disease (CHD) [37].  All in all, the most evident different changes induced by low fat diet (LFD) and MD on blood FAs were on omega−3, which have a range of reputed vasculoprotective effects [38,39], possibly related with the association between omega−3 blood FA levels and cardiovascular health reported in several observational studies [31,33]. In the present study, blood omega−3 levels were significantly correlated, as expected, with the number of fish servings per week and with the intake of nuts, (i.e., with two out of the three main food items that differed quantitatively between low fat diet (LFD) and MD). Both food items have been independently associated with cardiovascular protection [40,41].",3b1fca4d-dcb7-4ba0-b00e-593fe4f44044
16,methods16," On one hand, a recent pooled analysis of data from four cohort studies indicates that a minimal fish intake of 175 g weekly is associated with lower risk of major cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, specifically among patients with prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) [42]. These data are in line with the favorable effects of fish intake on CV outcomes observed in the only interventional study carried out so far, to the best of our knowledge, in patients with overt cardiovascular disease (CVD) [43]. On the other hand, though the intake of nuts has been associated with a reduction in incident cardiovascular events, coronary events and mortality in prospective cohort studies of subjects free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline [44,45], intervention studies assessing the specific effect of nuts on cardiovascular outcomes have not been performed in either primary or secondary prevention.",8d83e942-698d-41a6-b42d-c78ae1a48ea4
17,methods17,"  The results of ongoing studies [6,7] will shed light about the effect of a MD, typically rich in fish and nuts, on the residual risk of patients with a history of cardiovascular events, as those included in the present investigation.  As far as we know, this is the first study to compare the effects of the MD vs. a control low fat diet (LFD) on the blood FA profile in patients with overt cardiovascular disease (CVD) on-treatment with drugs that may potentially mask or counterweigh the benefits induced by the nutritional intervention.  Yet, this study has some limitations. First, it was carried out in Italians, a population with a traditional Mediterranean nutritional background. In fact, though we excluded a priori patients with a high MeDAS score, the mean baseline diet Mediterranean-ness of participants was actually not low but average (MeDAS about 7).",0f9b20bc-f766-4dfd-9fd1-66150bde5e36
18,methods18," As a consequence, the shift in dietary Mediterranean-ness reached with the MD was smaller than what might have been expected in a patient cohort with a usual Western diet. The two dietary interventions compared in this investigation are alike in several characteristics, and this may have led to the observed increase of the mean MeDAS score also in the low fat diet (LFD) group (Table 2). Moreover, in relation to each patient adherence and preferences, the change in diet Mediterranean-ness of individual participants was variable regardless group assignment. As a result, there was some overlap of MeDAS values between groups (data not shown), reducing the chance to fully reveal the impact of diet Mediterranean-ness in improving the blood FA profile.",b68093ba-4011-4ee6-a59b-0d1965a190db
19,methods19,"  Second, circulating FA were determined using a rapid analytical method in whole blood, which represents a mixed FA pool that may differ from those measured in plasma, lipoproteins or red blood cells, traditionally used in FA research [21,30]; however, beyond its practicality, blood FA represents a balanced proportion of all the circulating pools [46] and has been adopted in several studies [13,47,48,49].  In conclusion, the results of the present short-term randomized dietary intervention study show that MD and low fat diet (LFD) produce some equivalent “heart-friendly” changes in blood FA, whereas MD as well as the Mediterranean-ness of any of the dietary interventions may add distinctive beneficial effects, favoring a shift of the blood FA composition towards a healthier profile in patients with overt coronary heart disease (CHD) on multiple cardiovascular drugs.",c50acf98-8625-43ac-8ad6-ff26b6cb5ad4
20,methods20," These changes add to other beneficial effects of MD on intermediate surrogates of cardiovascular health, pending the results of ongoing secondary prevention studies with cardiovascular endpoints. ",0842abb3-96ee-4d3b-900f-8b3a11b6c26c
