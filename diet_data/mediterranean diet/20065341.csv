0,background0,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the industrialized part of the world with atherosclerosis being its primary manifestation [1]. The development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions has been studied extensively. Many clinical studies have been performed regarding dietary protocols, such as the Seven Countries study on Mediterranean diet which includes olive oil [2]. Other clinical studies have involved pharmaceutical [3] and surgical interventions alone [4], or in combination [5]. Scientific evidence for the pathogenesis and therapy of atherosclerosis during the last century has derived to a large extent from research protocols on animal models.  The rabbit, one of the most important models for the study of atherosclerosis, rapidly responds to the inducement of atherosclerotic lesions through a high cholesterol diet [6].",5db49dbf-4d35-43a8-8dd1-7b81861ec4b1
1,background1," Several dietary studies have used this model, including the administration of olive or fish oil and different seed extracts or oils, derived from sunflower seeds, peanuts, flaxseeds or hazelnuts [7-10]. An edible nut, consumed either alone or as an ingredient in traditional recipes, is the pistachio nut from the tree Pistacia vera, which belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is distributed in central and southeastern Greece, as well as other Mediterranean and Middle East countries. To our knowledge, only in vitro studies are published regarding its bioactive effect on the development of atherosclerosis [11]. We, therefore, sought to investigate the effect of P. vera cyclohexane (cyclohexane (CHE)) and methanolic extract (ME) administration on the rabbit experimental model of atherosclerosis on serum biochemistry, as well as aortic, heart and liver lesions.

Diets were freshly prepared every three days before use.  Preparation and analysis of the extracts Cyclohexane Extract of P. vera (cyclohexane (CHE)) A quantity of 15 Kg powdered pistachio nuts collected in the Greek island of Aegina was extracted at room temperature, first to be defatted with cyclohexane, giving 7.5 Kg of a green oil residue after evaporation of the solvent. The cyclohexane (CHE) was saponified by the usual procedure resulting to esterified fatty acids. The fatty acid methylesters of the oils and the unsaponified residue were analyzed by GC and GC/MS to afford b-sitosterol, squalene, stigmasterol, oleic acid and palmitic acid as major compounds (see Additional file 1) .

4,methods2," vera (ME) After the extraction of powdered pistachio nuts with cyclohexane, the plant material was further extracted with dichloromethane giving 1.5 Kg of green oily extract and then with methanol to give a residue of 500 g after evaporation of the solvent. A quantity of 400 g of the residue was subjected to XAD-4 resin for sugar removal and a ME enriched in phenolic compounds was obtained. In order to describe the chemical profile of the enriched extract a LC-DAD-ESI(-)-HRMS/MS method was developed. The analysis was performed using a UHPLC apparatus connected to the high resolution hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap Discovery spectrometer. The phenolic compounds, gallic methyl ester (1), gallic acid (2), protocatechuic acid (3) catechin (4) and epicatechin (5) were used as standards for the analysis and the identification thereof was accomplished by comparing the retention time, UV-Vis spectrum and high accurate mass spectra of the peaks in the sample to those of standard compounds.",c1a77daf-d5b5-43b5-b7d1-9190b952592a

7,methods5," The tissues adhering to the adventitia were removed and the aorta was cut longitudinally along the mid-ventral wall. The aorta was then fixed flatly in 10% phosphate buffered formalin solution. The luminal surface of each aortic specimen was photographed and the image was stored electronically. Sections from all specimens were obtained from three standard sites (immediately distal to the branch of the left subclavian artery, at the seventh intercostal artery and immediately posterior to the celiac artery). These samples were embedded in paraffin blocks and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The histopathologic atherosclerotic lesions of the aorta were classified according to the Stary [32] classification, while thickness and surface area of atherosclerotic lesions in the wall of aortae were semiquantified using an automated image analysis system [33].",2374607d-e595-405f-a902-48a513bc08c6

19,discussion0,"The non-genetic hyperlipidemic rabbit is an animal model widely used in atherosclerosis studies. Various levels of dietary cholesterol (0.2-1.3%) have been used to create the disease experimentally [12,13] and concomitant administration of other potentially beneficial substances has been studied for periods varying from 8 [12] up to 14 weeks [10,12].  The Pistacia plants are trees or bushes indigenous to Greece and other Mediterranean and Middle East countries. Among their 11 species, P. lentiscus has been shown to have antioxidant [14], antibacterial [15,16], liver-protective [17] and cytostatic [14] effects and to prevent human LDL-cholesterol from oxidation in vitro [18]. P. terebinthus has been demonstrated to have a beneficial action on uterine condylomata and skin melanomas [14]. Few studies have been carried out on P. vera. It has been reported to have plant antifungal effects [19]. P.",6c6d9312-8062-43bc-bab3-97b9e838b262
20,discussion1," vera ME contains small quantities of catechin, a polyphenolic flavonoid that shows potentially higher antioxidant activity than ascorbic acid and α- tocopherol in in vitro studies [20]. Catechin and its products have also been indicated as factors of reducing cardiovascular risk by lowering serum cholesterol levels, diminishing platelet aggregation and reducing blood pressure [21].  In the present study we investigated the effect of the co-administration of P. vera, on the progress of cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis of the rabbit animal model for 12 weeks. We chose to administer the ME or cyclohexane (CHE) of P. vera separately in different animal groups, in order to be able to identify which components would be responsible for the potentially different results. GC-MS analysis of the cyclohexane (CHE) showed that its major compounds are b-sitosterol, squalene, stigmasterol, oleic and palmitic acid.",566ea79a-7f72-4fe7-a776-0201b985ff50
21,discussion2," Clinical trials have already shown the protective effects of such plant sterols in the development of coronary heart disease [22]. Furthermore, analysis of the ME using LC-HRMS/MS techniques revealed the presence of gallic methyl ester, protocatechuic acid and gallic acid. Gallic acid has been demonstrated to have antiatherogenic activity [23].  The results of the present study show a beneficial effect of the co-administration of the P. vera ME and cyclohexane (CHE) in cholesterol enriched diet on HDL-C changes. ME also demonstrated less MDA change from baseline, revealing thus a mild antioxidant effect. The LDL-C beneficial effect of ME was not statistically significant. The other biochemical parameters examined (TC, triacylglycerol (TAG) and liver enzymes), did not demonstrate a beneficial effect of the ME with the analysis of data using % change median values.",075e164d-9d47-4a05-b06c-56c9aa2ec367
22,discussion3," The analysis of our data using mean absolute values showed a statistically significant protective effect of the ME on the above parameters (Table 1). However, because of the lack of normal distribution of the values, use of the non-parametric analysis (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests) was deemed necessary.  Several plant substances have a beneficial effect on blood biochemistry of cholesterol-fed rabbits. The olive oil polyphenol known as hydroxytyrosol increased the HDL-C levels of atherogenic diet-fed rabbits [13]. Sesame flour had a beneficial effect on the total cholesterol and triglyceride levels of cholesterol-fed rabbits [24]. Also, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG)), a plant lignan isolated from flaxseed when administered to rabbits for 8 weeks resulted in a decrease of LDL-C and an increase in HDL-C and antioxidant activity [9], similarly to our study.",950c7e4a-c475-43a3-bca4-ce5ebbafebcc
23,discussion4," Furthermore, another study in rabbits using ethanol extract of Hypericum lysimachioides Boiss var lysimachioides (Guttifera), showed a statistically significant decrease of MDA levels, as well as an increase of HDL-C levels, in agreement with our study [25].  Our results showed that treatment with both extracts of P. vera induces a mild increase in TC values, although this is not significantly different from the Control Group in the second and third month of administration.  HDL-C median values in the Control Group were lower at the end of the experiment, whereas the co-administration of P. vera extracts (Groups ME and cyclohexane (CHE)) significantly inhibited this decrease. Considering that low HDL-C is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, it is supported that increased HDL-C will result in a protective effect against atherosclerosis, after prolonged administration of the P. vera extracts.",5f3ab5ff-7d18-4188-aa38-08433866fe10
24,discussion5,"  Our results showed significant differences in plasma MDA levels between the ME and the Control Groups. This suggests that the P. vera ME's beneficial effect on some lipids and the aorta may be due to a mild anti-oxidant effect.  In our study, liver enzyme levels increased reaching maximum levels the third month in all groups. Specifically, aminotransferase (ALT) and aminotransferase (AST) changes were increased in Groups ME and cyclohexane (CHE) compared to Control. Both clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that elevated aminotransferase (ALT) and aminotransferase (AST) can be predictive for the development of atherosclerosis [26,25]. Furthermore, γGT changes of Group ME were statistically significantly lower in the third month compared to the Control Group. This is indicative of a beneficial effect of the P. vera ME and cyclohexane (CHE) in the function of the biliary system of atherosclerotic animals. In the study by Hakimoglu et al.",e5168152-cfd7-49bf-9fa7-24f97d2db136
25,discussion6," [25] liver hydropic and lipid degeneration was decreased in ethanol extract of Hypericum lysimachoides compared to that of the rabbits fed only with cholesterol enriched diet. This finding is similar to ours, where the liver histology of ME fed rabbits was less affected than the cholesterol group (Control), although there was no statistically significant difference. Specifically, the Control Group rabbits suffered from hepatic damage characterised by steatosis and fibrosis, which was even more evident in Group cyclohexane (CHE).  Macroscopically plaque formation in Group ME was less extensive compared to Groups Control and cyclohexane (CHE). Similarly to our study, other researchers have observed that despite increase of serum cholesterol after the administration of an extract, the pathology results of the aortic specimens may show an amelioration of the progress of atherosclerosis [27]. Aguilera et al.",75a07ed6-3da8-497e-ab8f-4bb6b2f22d07
26,discussion7," [8] found that virgin olive oil and fish oils reduce the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Hazelnut oil has also been shown to reduce atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta of cholesterol fed rabbits [10]. In addition, the effect of green tea administration containing epicatechin derived compounds in rabbits showed a beneficial effect on the arterial atherosclerotic plaques [28]. This is in agreement with our findings, which indicated a significant beneficial effect of the P. vera ME on the development of aortic atherosclerosis. Specifically, Group ME presented significant inhibition of atherosclerotic plaques regarding both their thickness and extent within the aortic lumen. This may be attributed to the major ME components, such as gallic acid and catechin that may be responsible for this inhibition process as already indicated [22,28].",5b7b896c-b9dd-4551-98d1-96733658cabd
27,discussion8," On the other hand, Group cyclohexane (CHE) exhibited milder atherosclerosis inhibition regarding plaque thickness, which can be attributed to the presence of b-sitosterol, squalene, stigmasterol, oleic and palmitic acid, as similarly shown [29,30].  Group cyclohexane (CHE) exhibited the lowest antioxidant activity. This effect can possibly be linked to the extensive but not so complicated atherosclerotic lesions observed in Group cyclohexane (CHE) aortic specimens compared to those of Groups Control and ME. Group ME, however, exhibited a much stronger antioxidant activity. The statistically significant observed antioxidant effect of the ME, evident by the MDA analysis, concomitantly decreased aortic plaque deposition significantly. On the other hand, the cyclohexane (CHE) did not affect the extent of atherosclerotic lesions. These findings may be attributed to P. vera ME constituents exerting antioxidant activity [11].",107686dd-7e2a-41fc-afa4-dd3e80805cb4
28,discussion9,"  Conclusions In conclusion, during short-term administration concomitantly with atherogenic diet, both P. vera extracts were beneficial on HDL-, LDL-cholesterol and aortic intimal thickness. The ME additionally presented an antioxidant effect and significant decrease of aortic surface lesions. These results indicate that P. vera dietary inclusion, in particular its ME, may potentially be beneficial in atherosclerosis management. P. vera ME and cyclohexane (CHE) are being used in vivo for the first time to our knowledge in the study of atherosclerosis and show a promising effect regarding its inhibition process. More research is required before P. vera may be clinically recommended for dietary inclusion for atherosclerosis management. ",35033fe1-8e96-4d5d-a981-01245cccfb60
