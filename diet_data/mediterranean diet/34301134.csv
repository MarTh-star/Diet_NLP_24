0,background0," Depression symptoms are prevalent in the general population, and their onset and continuation may be related to biological and psychosocial factors, many of which are related to lifestyle aspects. Health promotion and lifestyle modification programmes (LMPs) may be effective on reducing the symptoms. The objective of this study was to analyse the clinical effectiveness of a LMP and a LMP plus Information and Communication Technologies, when compared to Treatment as Usual (Treatment as Usual (TAU)) over 6 months. The interventions were offered as an adjuvant treatment delivered in Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCs) for people with depression symptoms. ",90b3ea9c-6e02-4b45-86de-451a92d2c882
1,methods0," We conducted an open-label, multicentre, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial. Participants were recruited from several PHCs. Those participants visiting general practitioner for any reason, who also met the inclusion criteria (scoring 10 to 30 points on the Beck II Self-Applied Depression Inventory) were invited to take part in the study. Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP consisted of six weekly 90-min group sessions focused on improving lifestyle. Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP + ICTs replicated the Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP format, plus the addition of a wearable smartwatch to measure daily minutes walked and sleep patterns. A total of 188 participants consented to participate in the study and were randomized. We used linear mixed models, with a random intercept and an unstructured covariance to evaluate the impact of the interventions compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU).

2,analysis0," Firstly, a descriptive analysis (frequencies for categorical variables; means and standard deviation for continuous variables) and a univariate analysis (one-way ANOVA for age, BDI-II, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-SF, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), and Chi-Square test for the remaining variables) were used to examine the data and tested whether there were baseline differences between groups after randomization. Secondly, to answer the main objective – whether there were differences between treatment groups regarding their effectiveness in reducing depression—we used Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMEMs) (35). We specified a model with a random intercept and unstructured covariance. The parameter of interest was the interaction effect of treatment and time in a model that also included age as a covariate because it was the only baseline variable that was significantly different between groups.",27360933-ea57-404b-ac74-836d0ee0f9dd
3,analysis1," Cohen's d (d) is calculated from the estimated mean values of BDI-II and its standard deviations (SD) at baseline (36).  Moreover, to answer the second question—whether there were differences between treatment groups with respect to the improvement of lifestyle variables—we used LMEMs with the same previous components.  The statistical analysis was carried out per intention-to-treat analysis (intention to treat analysis (ITT)) (i.e., all participants who were randomized were included in the statistical analysis and were analyzed according to the group to which they were originally assigned) (37). The results from the trial were presented as a regression coefficient for predicting change in primary and secondary outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. LMEMs were tested against a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of 0.01 (0.05/5) (38). A statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software (version 25.0) (39).

11,discussion0," The findings of this study indicate that over 6 months, Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMPs were effective in decreasing depressive symptoms. Also, Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMPs helped in the adoption of several healthier lifestyle behaviors when compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU).  The findings of this study are consistent with other Spanish randomized controlled trial (RCT)s on psychoeducational group interventions delivered by PHC nurses for people with depression and physical comorbidity (40, 41). Furthermore, they are also consistent with a multidisciplinary online programmes that integrates evidence-based tactics from the fields of lifestyle medicine (42), as well as with a recent pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) about a group-based lifestyle medicine for depression (43).",4f6bb6b3-8d6a-4b2f-98ff-a4e81ac9760a
12,discussion1,"  Recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trial (RCT)s concluded that multi-component LMPs (with three lifestyle factors such as physical activity, nutritional advice, and sleep management) appeared to be effective in mitigating depressive symptoms (44, 45). A recent Spanish longitudinal cohort study (46), a cross-sectional study about health conditions, lifestyle factors and depression (47) and a recent meta-analysis of observational studies (48) have all shown that healthy lifestyles are associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms.  Regarding changes on lifestyle, reflecting a long-lasting effect of the interventions, people receiving the Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP+ICTs group significantly increased their total weekly minutes of walking (approximately, 1 h and three quarters) when compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU).",8a76385c-b959-4e38-a31f-e24ca4578480
13,discussion2," Participants following the Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP also increased their minutes of walking (approximately 1 h), but those results only showed a certain trend toward significance. A systematic review and a meta-analysis analyzing randomized controlled trial (RCT)s about the treatment effect of exercise on depression (49, 50) concluded that physical exercise is an effective intervention for depression. Moreover, evidence suggests that it is not only necessary to be physically active but also to limit the number of hours spent being sedentary (51). In the same line, in a cross-sectional study with primary care patients, depression symptoms were associated with physical inactivity (52). Participants from the Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP+ICTs group reduced their total daily minutes seated (~45 min) almost significantly. This lack of relationship found between sedentary lifestyle and depression may be due to the fact that what the participants did while sitting was not controlled.",326a62d3-b61b-4c67-9484-627ccf0c14e6
14,discussion3," Therefore, time spent being sedentary could have been used doing pleasant leisure activities (i.e., watching TV, reading or using the computer) (53).  An randomized controlled trial (RCT) associated physical activity with elevated mood and with a significant reduction in the severity of insomnia symptoms (54). In our study, there was a significant reduction in bad sleep quality among the participants from the Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP. In a recent cross-sectional study, inadequate sleep was associated with most health disabilities and major depression (55). Furthermore, a meta-analysis concluded that a lack of good sleep quality is significantly associated with depression in older adults (56), and another meta-analysis stated that certain sleep disorders (nightmares and insomnia) increase the risk of suicidal behavior in depressed patients (57).  A recent cross-sectional study observed positive associations between a healthy diet and sleep with mental health (58).",47d269b6-450c-4870-aa0a-8d04ac6e1c74
15,discussion4," Participants from the Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP+ICTs group significantly increased their adherence to the Mediterranean diet. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) determined that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was related to fewer depressive symptoms (59). A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial (RCT)s determined that dietary interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms (60). Moreover, meta-analyses of observational studies indicated that adults following a healthy dietary pattern have fewer depressive symptoms and a lower risk of developing depressive symptoms (61). In particular, adhering to the Mediterranean diet appeared to reduce the risk of depression (62).  The differences found between both interventions (Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP and Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP+ICTs) could be due to the use of the wearable smartwatch for monitoring. We have found the following advantages of its use.",e475765a-f4a4-4430-b717-04ce3eaa0c98
16,discussion5," Firstly, the patients from the Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP+ICTs group had a more remarkable reduction in their depression and, as previously stated, this reduction of depression might be clinically relevant. Secondly, these patients had significantly increased the minutes of walking per week and they also increased their adherence to the Mediterranean diet. However, participants from this group did not have a significant improvement in their sleep quality, whereas the participants from the Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP improved their sleep. These results may have been influenced by the individual use of the smartwatch. Most of the patients from the Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP+ICTs group were very excited about using this device, however, most of them did not wear it during the night. As such, feedback about their sleep was not available. This underuse of the smartwatch could have been due to the patients' acceptance of technologies (63).",5b343bd4-2101-4e5e-b385-df629893929a
17,discussion6,"  Regarding the limitations and strengths of the study, the first strength was the study's design; a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) with sample homogeneity between groups. As the study was developed in primary care conditions, the research results are easily transferable to practice. Another advantage is that since the randomization was blind, the evaluations and the statistical analysis provided greater validity to the results. Furthermore, and as a new characteristic, numerous aspects of healthy lifestyles were considered together and no adverse effects from the interventions were reported. In this regard, the group intervention format offered social support, a sense of belonging and the opportunity to share common difficulties (64). Finally, the participant profile was similar to regular PHC patients.  One limitation was the overlap with COVID-19 since participants found it difficult to properly implement the lifestyle guidelines during this time (65).",0fd8ff9c-9190-4097-be70-9a44b7a6687d
18,discussion7," Despite session attendance being high (5 out of the 6 sessions), another issue was the dropout rate, which was mostly due to time incompatibility or a lack of interest in answering the questionnaires during the follow-up. Furthermore, the sample was predominantly female and, as such, no analysis by gender could be performed. Finally, due to the nature of the intervention, both the psychologist who led the sessions and the participants were aware of the assigned intervention during the randomized controlled trial (RCT).  Future trials with larger sample sizes could plan for subgroup analyses. For example, analyzing the effectiveness of an Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMP for the different severities of depression (i.e., subclinical, mild, moderate and even severe). Moreover, recruiting more men may be beneficial to be able to make gender comparisons. Furthermore, adherence strategies (i.e., sending text messages) (66) may be considered in future randomized controlled trial (RCT)s.",6e4b8f90-2e48-4ebb-852e-ec3052cfb270
19,discussion8," In addition, qualitative studies should be carried out to investigate the specific causes of dropout. Regarding the use of ICTs, more studies are needed to determine how to improve adherence and compliance rates so that people can wear wearable devices continuously for 24 h (20).  Conclusion  Treatment as Usual (TAU)+LMPs administered in PHCs to people suffering from mainly moderate depression were effective in reducing depressive symptomatology comparing to Treatment as Usual (TAU). The use of ICTs resulted in a greater improvement in depression and in several lifestyle factors (weekly minutes of walking and adherence to the Mediterranean diet). More research is needed to enhance adherence. These promising programmes could be easily implemented in PHCs.
