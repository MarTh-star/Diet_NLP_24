0,methods0," 2.1. Design  This was a cross-sectional study.  2.2. Subjects  Lebanese adults were invited to participate in this study through community announcements. Participants were asked to come to the data collection clinic fasting for at least 8 h and were included in the study if they met the following inclusion criteria: aged between 18 and 65 years, of Lebanese nationality, free of active infections (including COVID-19), not pregnant or lactating, do not use medications that affect the metabolism of Vitamin D such as seizure drugs: Phenobarbital and Dilantin (phenytoin), and anti-tuberculosis drugs, and free of any preexisting specified disease that affects the metabolism of Vitamin D such as significant renal or liver disease.  2.3. Ethical Considerations  The participants were informed about the study objectives, protocol, and the right to withdraw from the study at any time and were only included in the study once they gave verbal consent.",ef334adc-a262-45ee-8d59-621a3d2a4191

Data Collection  2.4.1. Blood withdrawal  A 5-mL blood sample was then collected into a sterile serum separator tube with a clot activator by a certified phlebotomist. Blood samples were then transported via a thermally insulated box to the laboratory where samples were centrifuged at 4000 revolutions per minute for 10 min and analyzed for serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (ng/mL) using an automated chemiluminescence micro-particle immunoassay (chemiluminescence micro particle immunoassay (CMIA)) kit (ARCHITECT; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). This is a delayed one-step immunoassay including a sample pre-treatment for the quantitative determination of Vitamin D in competitive chemiluminescence micro particle immunoassay (CMIA) technology with flexible assay protocols.  2.4.2.",212d4a7f-6265-47ab-94b5-3f7014061e8b
2,methods2," Questionnaires  Demographic and medical history questionnaire: included several questions related to age, gender, educational level, employment status, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and personal and family history of chronic diseases.  Birmingham irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) scale: this is a self-administered 11-item symptom questionnaire (based on Rome II criteria). Questions assess irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-related symptoms in the previous four weeks, whereby each question has a standard response scale. Symptoms are measured based on a 6-point Likert scale (0–5) ranging from all of the time to none of the time and converted to 100. The scale has 3 dimensions (pain, constipation, and diarrhea) and is designed to enable assessment of symptom burden. In the validation study by Roalfe et al. [24], the score had a high internal validity (Cronbach’s α of 0.74 for pain, 0.79 for constipation, and 0.90 for diarrhea), as well as good external validity (r = −0.3 to −0.",e95ecfe9-2156-44fa-970e-1b28488c2e7d
3,methods3,"6) for pain and diarrhea and moderate external validity (r = −0.2 to −0.3) for constipation; with all dimensions being reproducible (ICCs 0.75 to 0.81).  Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)): this is a 14-item questionnaire adapted from the PREvencion con DIetaMEDiterranea (PREvencion con DIetaMEDiterranea (PREDIMED)) [25] study. The questions are related to food intake/frequency of foods. Answers that are in favor of the Mediterranean date are scored with one point, whereas unfavorable responses are given a score of 0. The final score is calculated by adding all responses to the 14 questions. The final score ranges between 0 and 14, whereby higher scores indicate more adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) showed to be a valid tool for rapidly assessing and providing advice on adherence to the Mediterranean diet compared with an extensive full-length food frequency questionnaire [26].",a33690f9-04b5-4fb4-80fb-9134b4d3bc66
4,methods4," Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) has been extensively used in the international literature and was validated for various settings and populations.  The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) Short Form [27]: the validated Arabic version of the questionnaire was used [28]. International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-Short Form includes seven questions regarding duration and frequency of light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity performed in the past week. The Metabolic Equivalent of Tasks (METs) are calculated by multiplying the total minutes expended in a certain activity by the frequency (days) by the constants of 3.3, 4.0, and 8.0 for light, moderate, and vigorous activity, respectively. The total MET values are calculated by totaling the respective MET values for all activities that were performed in bouts that were more than 10 minutes in duration.",aeed7b7c-b8af-48c2-a836-60b155b705a5
5,methods5,"  The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)): this questionnaire consists of 9 questions, four of which assess sleep duration (hours), duration needed to fall asleep, amount of time required to wake up, and time spent in bed while awake. The five other questions assess reasons for sleep troubles. A total score is computed using an algorithm adapted from the developers of the questionnaire. Higher scores (≥5) indicate poor sleep quality [29]. The Arabic version of the questionnaire, culturally adapted by Haidar et al. [30], was used.  The 10-item Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10): this is a 10-item questionnaire aimed at measuring stress levels in the last month. Questions investigate feelings for which respondents find their present life situation unpredictable, uncontrollable, and stressful. PSS uses a 5-point scale ranging from never (0) to very often (4).",c8df4138-0217-4064-ae31-99d402a6c343
6,methods6," The total score ranges from 0 to 40, where higher scores indicate higher perceived stress levels [31,32]. The Arabic version of the questionnaire, validated by Chaaya et al. [33], was used.  The Brief Questionnaire to Assess Habitual Beverage Intake Questionnaire (Beverage Intake Questionnaire (BEVQ)): this is a brief food frequency questionnaire used to rapidly assess habitual beverage intake among adults in the previous month, and to determine possible associations of beverage consumption with health-related outcomes. Patients were asked to indicate the type, frequency, and number of beverages consumed. Total fluid intake (fl oz) and fluid intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (fl oz) were computed for this study [34].  The Birmingham irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) scale, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), and Beverage Intake Questionnaire (BEVQ) were translated into Arabic following best practices [35].",c71cce3b-c769-4641-8834-5b1432a3f36c
7,methods7," First, the original tools were translated into Arabic, then the Arabic version was translated back into English. The two English versions were compared, and essential adjustments were made to the Arabic version.  The questionnaire was pilot-tested on ten adults prior to data collection. Feedback from the pilot was used to produce the final version of the questionnaire.  2.5. Statistical Analysis  The data were analyzed using SPSS, version 25. A descriptive analysis was done using the counts and percentages for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous measures. Normality distribution was checked using visual inspection of the histogram and verified by checking the normality line of the regression plot and the scatter plot of the residual.",59fe9526-a5f2-4c60-a7d0-c147ac10d983
8,methods8," Independent-sample t-test was used to compare the mean of the Birmingham irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptom questionnaire and subscales (pain, constipation, and diarrhea) between two groups, whereas ANOVA test was used to compare three or more means. Pearson correlation test was used to evaluate the association between continuous variables and the Birmingham irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptom questionnaire and each of the subscales (pain, constipation, and diarrhea). Four multivariable linear regression analyses using the Enter method were performed, taking respectively the Birmingham irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptom questionnaire total scale and each of the subscales (pain, constipation, and diarrhea) as the dependent variable and variables showing a p-value less than 0.2 in the bivariate analysis as independent variables, in addition to Vitamin D which was forced into each model. p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.  3.

14,methods14," Discussion  Our results suggest that serum Vitamin D is not associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in a sample of Lebanese adults. This finding adds to the growing controversy in this field. Although our findings are in contrast to previous studies highlighting Vitamin D’s role in the pathogenicity of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), owing to its function in the intestinal barrier and mucosal inflammatory state [17,18,19,23,36,37], and to other research reporting alleviation in gastrointestinal symptoms with Vitamin D supplementation [38], they are parallel to those reported by Williams et al. [39], who found no benefit on gastrointestinal disturbances following Vitamin D supplementation even though baseline deficiencies were adjusted. The variability of our results could be attributed to confounding variables such as Vitamin D supplementation and body fat composition [39]; or to the established irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) syndrome heterogeneity [39].",965cf390-6aee-478e-91bd-ba0063d77820
15,methods15," Moreover, Vitamin D deficiencies among irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) individuals may be attributed to diet and lifestyle deviations to avoid symptoms triggering thus limiting exposures to Vitamin D sources such as off-putting outdoor activities or restraining from certain meals [40]. Furthermore, Agnello et al. [41] supported a connection for microbiome composition changes in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pathogenesis, suggesting clinical relevance in monitoring and investigating the microbiome in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [41]. Due to its heterogeneous nature, there may be a cumulative alteration in the gut microbiome leading to dysbiosis and increased risk of chronic gastroenterological conditions. Future large studies are needed to better understand the conditions for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pathogenesis and its association with risk factors.",9a5d05ce-6f6c-4884-9c74-aafedae6bdce
16,methods16,"  Our findings demonstrate that females had a higher propensity for experiencing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms than males, specifically for constipation. This could be attributed to differences in intestinal motor and sensory functions, hormones, and microbiota between the genders linked to gut-brain interactions [42,43]. It is well known that estrogen and progesterone hormones inhibit smooth muscle contraction, which has an effect on peristalsis [42] and thus constipation. Additionally, sex hormones have an impact on bacterial growth, expression, and metabolism which can explain the differences between genders [42]. The exact mechanisms still need to be elucidated.  Additionally, our results reveal that a higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pain symptoms; however, we did not find an association with total irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) scores.",07a4f304-78ef-4d10-af02-0384681e76e3
17,methods17," These findings are in line with other studies reporting increased irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in obese participants [44]. Furthermore, Clements et al. [45] found that in obese subjects, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms decreased secondary to bariatric surgery. One possible mechanism where irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms develop in obese persons is related to the altered small bowel and colonic transit time [46]. Given the limited data with regard to altered intestinal motility in obesity, additional investigation is warranted before this can be evoked as an explanation for the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms among this population group. Moreover, low-fiber and high refined-carbohydrate diets are linked to obesity and are another potential contributor to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms [47]. Finally, gut microbiota shift, reported in both obesity and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), may also explain the possible connection [48].",59d068c4-ae9e-4ab8-b01a-265efd61a026
18,methods18," The above mechanisms are still insufficient to establish a causal relationship between gut microbiota shifts and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in obese patients; however, the main question lies in whether irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms are likely to increase obesity or whether it is the other way around. Future studies should further address this question.  Another interesting finding in our study is the lack of association between stress and any of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) dimensions studied. This is in contrast to an abundance of studies that have reported higher gastrointestinal disturbances associated with psychological distress [49,50]. Surdea-Blaga et al. [51], found that stressful life events may aggravate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in approximately one-third of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These conflicting results could be attributed to genetic and ethnic factors [52].",a91072fa-5f2e-48c1-bda4-725eadc02d18
19,methods19," Tran [53] suggests that research on social stress should take ethnic identification and gender variables into consideration. The direction of the connection between stress and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) also needs further research. irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis can be a significant predictor of perceived stress, and higher perceived stress increases the odds of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis [54].  Interestingly, our results show that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was inversely associated with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pain subscale. This was unexpected since irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) dietary recommendations suggest that a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP)) is used to manage irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms.",76b70cd3-f194-4127-a7c0-311d4be71522
20,methods20," However, it is possible that the anti-inflammatory properties of the Mediterranean diet helped in pain management among irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients [55].  Our study presented several strengths. It is the first study of its kind to be carried out in the Middle East assessing Vitamin D levels as related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms while accounting for possible confounders. Furthermore, biochemical parameters were analyzed in a certified laboratory in Lebanon. Additionally, we used validated assessment tools and scales. In contrast, the study presents some limitations. First, the study has a cross-sectional design not allowing casual inferences [56]. Furthermore, as for the general Lebanese population [57], the majority of the sample had Vitamin D deficiency, which could have confounded or further underestimated any association with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms.",0bc4a46b-2a6e-4afe-870f-f3fdc2981df9
21,methods21," Moreover, the small sample size might have been insufficient to detect significant associations between Vitamin D and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Finally, this study was carried out during an unpreceded economic crisis, which could have probably heightened the stress levels of the participants and hindered our ability to find any association between stress and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  5. Conclusions  This study highlighted the association of gender, body mass index (BMI), and diet with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, whereas the relationship with physical activity, psychological distress, and Vitamin D could not be established. Further understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in Vitamin D and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is necessary to better uncover their association and to develop approaches that may be effective for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients.
