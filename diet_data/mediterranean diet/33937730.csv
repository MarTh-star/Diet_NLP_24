2,results0," Active female participants were recruited for this randomized crossover study to assess the impact of diet on eCBome mediators response post maximal aerobic exercise. Overall, participants had Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference averages representing a healthy body weight (Table 1). The mean estimated VO2max of participants was categorized as “sportive” for 20–29 year old individuals (Table 3)44. Likewise, the average heart rate at 5-min post-test was slightly below the 101–102 bpm of healthy subjects after a short treadmill exercise test reported in previous studies45, 46. The estimated VO2 max and the max heart rate were similar in both tests thus confirming that the intensity and effort were similar between diet interventions.Table 3 Aerobic measurements after CanDiet and MedDiet.

After CanDiet, most 2-MAGs, excluding 2-docosahexaenoyl glycerol (DHG) and 2-docosaepentaenoic glycerol (DPG), had similar concentrations at Tpre and T60, which suggests a return to basal levels after exercise.

Plasma PUFA levels peaked at T0 post exercise, remained high 15 min and returned to their initial levels at T60 only when participants consumed the MedDiet. When participants consumed the CanDiet, plasma fatty acid composition remained stable through time and only marginal changes in relation to exercise were observed for the n-3 PUFAs.

The acetic acid curve had a similar shape between the two dietary interventions, with concentrations that remained significantly superior in the MedDiet compared with the CanDiet throughout the protocol. The isobutyric acid response was nearly identical between the two diets, with a strong peak at T0 with MedDiet and CanDiet and a gradual return to initial level at later time points.

Discussion and conclusions  The objective of this study was to determine if diet composition influenced the acute response post maximal exercise of circulating eCBome mediators and SCFAs in a sample of active women with no underlying metabolic conditions. Overall, our observations suggested that plasma eCBs, their congeners and some PUFAs, which are both ultimate biosynthetic precursors and metabolic products of these mediators, exhibit higher concentrations at the cessation of exercise. However, not all eCBome mediators reacted similarly, even when they belonged to the same family.",aec0f574-281b-4415-b186-d734a7b4311f
15,results14," The diet had a strong influence on many molecules, especially some NAEs and PUFAs, while other metabolites, including SCFAs, did not seem to be affected by the diet in the present study. Most NAEs and PUFAs increased after exercise when the participants consumed the MedDiet, but not when they ate the CanDiet. This relationship was different for 2-MAGs, which in most cases reacted similarly post-exercise with either the MedDiet or the CanDiet. Considering that fecal gut microbiota was modestly altered by the diet, the investigation of the interaction between diet, gut microbiota, eCBome and exercise were limited in this study.  This study showed that several plasmatic eCBs, eCB-like molecules and PUFAs had higher concentration at the end of aerobic exercise during MedDiet. For many of these metabolites, concentrations returned to baseline levels during the recovery phase.",6ba230f1-76e1-4869-b160-47ffc0fc0ec6
16,results15," Previous work among heterogeneous populations globally showed that NAEs significantly increased upon 30 min of exercise of moderate intensity or over in a short-term manner13, 14, 22, 47. Interestingly, NAEs levels were also enhanced with a longer aerobic demand lasting up to 5 h in hypoxic conditions15. Some investigators have shown that AEA and oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) increased after 20 min of moderate exercise, while 2-AG, palmitoyl ethanolamine (PEA) and 2-OG remained stable for adult women reporting major depressive disorder48. The same conclusion was made among women of 27 to 43 years-of-age, where AEA and oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) increase was associated to moderate-vigorous daily exercise49. Therefore, it was not surprising that AEA and oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) were both responsive to aerobic exercise of maximal intensity in the present study, also considering that they share similar metabolic pathways50.",8785355b-b248-4b1d-95f6-4e51a78e358a
17,results16," However, Crombie and colleagues (2018) documented that not only AEA, oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA), but also 2-AG concentrations greatly increased following 30 min of moderate running in healthy adults, females in majority51. The increase of AEA levels after aerobic exercise could be due to the decrease of the major AEA degradation enzyme (fatty acid amide hydrolase) as shown in a middle-aged female cohort52. Conversely, another study in healthy people found that the long-term impact of exercise intervention was to reduce plasma AEA concentration53. After 30 min of arm cycling at a steady pace and incremental load, plasma levels of oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA), palmitoyl ethanolamine (PEA), SEA and 2-AG were similar to levels prior to exercise after 60 min recovery, while AEA levels were slightly lower after recovery54, which supports the short-lasting effect of exercise on eCBome mediators.",1f86ffd6-ac92-4077-9b62-22d630e9ac97
18,results17," While incongruences in intervention and inclusion criteria are existent in the cited studies, these past results are coherent with the observations of the current study. However, previous studies in humans on the effect of exercise on plasma eCBs and eCB congener-like mediators did not consider the possible role of underlying dietary habits, which may also account for, or contribute to, the often slight but nevertheless important differences in the outcomes of such studies.  Indeed, we found that the diet influences the concentrations of specific eCBome mediators before and after aerobic exercise. A recent and similarly designed (but exercise-unrelated) study showed that the intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)55, arachidonic acid (AA) and oleic acid (OA) was correlated to greater levels of plasma n-3 fatty acid- or OA-derived mediators23.",534ace00-e2eb-4db7-ba8d-d97af87eec0f
19,results18," The higher proportions of dietary and available PUFAs, Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)s, OA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the MedDiet compared to the CanDiet could have contributed to the increase of n-3, n-6 and n-6 PUFA-derived NAE levels for participants under MedDiet. An additional explanation to the enhancer effect of the MedDiet on NAE and PUFA levels with exercise could be its modulation of muscle-specific eCB enzyme expression by both the diet56 and training50 observed in lean and obese subjects. Dietary fat intake was also associated to CB1 expression level reduction in the skeletal muscle in humans and rats47, 56 and could likewise explain the weaker alteration of eCB levels with exercise in CanDiet compared to MedDiet.  The alterations by either the diet or exercise, or both, of the plasma concentrations of eCBome mediators are likely to have functional consequences1, 8, 57.",7fcd0420-a8dc-4bc5-8ba0-7064d1aeb197
20,results19," These molecules have several molecular targets among G protein-coupled receptors, ligand-activated ion channels and nuclear receptors, which have been implicated to different degrees in the metabolic and mood effects of food intake and exercise. In particular, although it is not possible to infer central actions from circulating endocannabinoid levels, CB1 receptor activation by AEA and 2-AG after the MedDiet immediately following the onset of exercise might induce anxiolytic and antidepressant action in response to stress, thus contributing to the runners “high”, and at the same time favouring food intake to replenish fuel exhausted because of exercise8. By contrast, in non-metabolically healthy people, CB1 activation in the periphery may contribute to energy accumulation and to chronic low-grade inflammation1.",de0bf17a-57eb-4e16-b493-ccfd08b15caf
21,results20," The decrease of eCBs during the process of recovery after exercise, in one or both diets, might be required to enhance the mobilization of energy necessary for physical exercise and its recovery. The elevated levels of the PPARα agonist oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) following the MedDiet and throughout the duration of exercise might allow for enhanced lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, again necessary for energy expenditure. For CanDiet individuals, this role might be played instead by 1/2-PG, another PPARα agonist58, whose levels remained higher at later times following the onset of exercise in these subjects. Stimulation by exercise of LEA and 1/2-LG levels, by activating GPR119, a glucagon-like peptide-1 releasing receptor in L cells of the intestinal epithelium, or transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 channels in pancreatic β-cells, might contribute to counterbalancing CB1 activation, notably in terms of regulating insulin release and sensitivity50, 59.",38427557-02df-484b-a96d-590ecf93d111
22,results21," Finally, the overall increased levels of Epalmitoyl ethanolamine (PEA) and 1/2-eicosapentaenoyl glycerol (EPG), two potential anti-inflammatory mediators, with the MedDiet might confer to individuals under such dietary condition resistance to exercise stress-induced inflammation.  We observed a limited effect of the diet on gut microbiota composition. This was not entirely surprising as individuals who are used to carry out sport are known to harbour a more stable gut microbiota with improved metabolic functions than sedentary individuals60. The structural diversity and stability of the participants’ baseline gut microbiota could explain the modest impact of the diet on gut microbiota composition61. The effect of the dietary intervention on circulating SCFAs was also limited, as only acetic acid and isovaleric acid were significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in the MedDiet before aerobic exercise.",9aa28e41-3bb9-48e9-8c09-44f8f34682c1
23,results22," Minimal microbiota modulation by the diets could explain why little changes in SFCA levels post exercise were observed between diets. Indeed, bacteria associated with butyrate production, for example Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae62–64, already had a high relative abundance in participants before intervention and their levels did not vary significantly between the diets. Nevertheless, contrasting modulation of acetate and isovalerate in response to diet and exercise might indicate that even minimal diet-induced changes in the gut microbiota of healthy lifestyle young healthy individuals may have functional importance, as acetate is considered beneficial and isovalerate detrimental for metabolic health65. In past studies, SCFA levels in feces were related to diet and an active lifestyle66–70. Previous studies mostly assessed fecal concentrations after exercise60, 63, or in cohorts of athletes compared to controls71.",78159f9b-e249-4d52-8bf0-aed13cd71697
24,results23," Additional studies suggested that propionic acid and butyric acid increased with exercise72–75. Our findings provide new insight on SCFA modulation by maximal exercise.  In summary, this study investigated the response to acute maximal aerobic test of an extensive array of eCBome mediators, covering NAEs, MAGs, and some of their corresponding free fatty acids. It also provided profiles for acute SCFA levels in plasma following exercise. A clear limitation of our study is the small size of the cohort sampled. However, we overcame this limitation by using a randomized crossover design, which allowed participants to act as their own controls. Additionally, we submitted the participants to stringent admissibility criteria and to a controlled full-feeding program prior to the acute maximal aerobic test, which minimized many transient and permanent confounding variables that could have affected the results.",bd4ce524-716d-42e0-9c04-47cd8cd38396
25,results24," These strategies helped to compensate for the potential problems arising from the use of a small sample of participants and allowed to observe statistically significant alterations by either diet, exercise, or both. An important strength of the study is the selection of a homogenous population characterized by women living an active lifestyle. This cohort enabled to distinguish the effect of intense physical activity from extreme homeostatic stress, which unfit individuals would have faced. Overall, our study shows that eCBome mediators react to acute exercise in a way that is dependent on the diet consumed in the week prior to exercise.
