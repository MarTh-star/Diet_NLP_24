0,background0,"Over the past half century, large, population-based, epidemiologic studies, among which the Framingham Heart Study represents a landmark [1], have established the prognostic significance of several factors such as hypercholesterolemia, arterial hypertension (AH) and diabetes mellitus (DM) in the appearance of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [2, 3]. Further investigations demonstrated the etiologic association between the aforementioned morbid conditions and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), in this way recognizing the former as potential therapeutic targets [4, 5].",25e34cb0-92bd-45ec-90ac-bd12ed8dfa65
1,background1," Despite the undisputed efficacy and safety of several medications aiming to decrease cardiovascular risk, it has been reported that cardiovascular disease (CVD): a) remains the leading cause of mortality, accounting for approximately one third of all deaths worldwide, b) claims more lives than all cancers combined and c) accounts for annual direct and indirect costs in excess of $ 316.6 billion in the U.S.A. alone [6].  Despite the lack of relevant collective consciousness and education, the importance of behavior-modifying measures in improving health and prolonging survival is paramount [7]. The Mediterranean diet represents a typification of a balanced intake of nutrients, vitamins and traces, while its association with improvement of several health indices has been stressed by various studies [8–10]. The qualitative composition of the diet, however, varies greatly among Mediterranean countries and within regions of the same country [11].",cca1c66f-5aa2-42f5-b67b-3098b5490ef3
2,background2,"  There are in Greece about 70 small islands spread in the Aegean and Ionian seas, of less than 300 km2 and 5000 inhabitants each, representing a total population of about 75,000 individuals, with geographical and socioeconomic characteristics of special interest. Islands may serve as “epidemiologic laboratories” in which different hypotheses can be tested that could otherwise not be readily assessed elsewhere [12]. Greek island inhabitants have been traditionally occupied with agricultural, farming and piscatorial activities and are considered to be populations highly adherent to the Mediterranean diet. The classic Seven Country Study (Seven Country Study (SCS)), which demonstrated the significance of traditional Mediterranean diet in limiting the incidence of coronary heart disease during the 1950’s, included individuals from two big Greek islands (Crete and Corfu) [13].",3d1b2aee-8f7c-425b-b30c-85576b6f46c6

PERSEAS (Prospective Evaluation of cardiovascular Risk Surrogates in Elafonisos Area Study) is an ongoing, population-based, longitudinal survey of cardiovascular risk factors, life-style characteristics and related morbidity/mortality in Elafonisos, a small, relatively isolated island of about 20 km2 and about 1000 inhabitants (Fig. 1).

The interview and clinical examinations were performed by trained personnel during two pre-specified weeks in September 2012 and September 2013 respectively.  Study questionnaires The basic questionnaire included information on a wide variety of features including demographics, educational level, smoking habits, sleep habits and a detailed medical history.  Dietary habits were assessed using a validated food-frequency questionnaire.",490c3055-269b-4b1e-87a7-7a948e1bd528
6,methods1," The questionnaire was validated regarding its test-retest reliability in our population with a random sub-group of 50 individuals who completed the questionnaire twice with a two week interval. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was 0.88 (P < 0.001). The individuals answered questions about their typical weekly consumption of different food categories (whole grains, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, legumes, fish, olive oil, red meat, poultry and full fat dairy products). Weekly alcohol consumption was estimated on the basis of 100 ml-wine glass equivalents [14]. A validated dietary score assessing adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet, the MedDietScore [14], which has been previously described in detail [15, 16], was calculated. In brief, the score takes values between 0 and 55 with greater values indicating higher adherence.

Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure All participants underwent height and weight measurements on site. An average of two measurements of height was obtained with a calibrated anthropometer, used by trained personnel. The participants were weighed without shoes, wearing light clothing and, subsequently, the two values were averaged. Body weight was determined to the nearest 100 g using a digital scale.

9,methods4,"  Blood pressure was measured according to the standards outlined in the relevant 2013 European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology guidelines on AH [18]. Specifically, blood pressure was measured by use of a validated electronic device (M2 Basic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor, Omron). Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg. The diagnosis of hypertension was based on two blood pressure measurements in the sitting position. Patients with elevated values of BP were re-evaluated on a second visit.  Blood measurements All blood measurements were performed in the morning, after an eight-hour, overnight fast.

19,discussion0,"The current study demonstrates that obesity, diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are highly prevalent among the inhabitants of the small, relatively isolated Greek island of the Aegean Sea, Elafonisos. Moreover, a large proportion of the participants were unaware of their condition.  The findings of our study are in line with epidemiologic studies repeatedly showing a steep increase of obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors worldwide during the last 40 years [22, 23]. Moreover, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in our study approximates the figures reported by a large cross-sectional nationwide survey almost a decade ago [24]. As expected the prevalence of overweight and obesity increases significantly after the age of 45 years in both sex groups. However, in contrast to the previously reported Greek data, obesity seems to be more common among women inhabitants of Elafonisos.",cdaf72cd-e00f-4f3a-9699-cec944a0bf85
20,discussion1," This distinct finding could be attributed to the special occupational characteristics of this population, as many of the male inhabitants of the island are engaged in agricultural, farming and piscatorial activities, whereas many of the female inhabitants are mainly occupied in housework activities.  The prevalence of reported DM in our study (7.7%) was comparable to the one of drug-prescribed DM among Greek people > 15 years of age (8.2%), found in a recent, nationwide prescription database study [25]. However, it was significantly lower than the one reported (12.0%) in a recent cross-sectional survey of a randomly selected population of the municipality of Saronikos [26], which is part of the greater Athens area, These differences among individual populations may reflect the effect of genetic, environmental or health policy factors. Finally, with regards to arterial hypertension, our results are in line with those reported by the ATTICA study in 2001 [27].",32df8e26-fbcb-454c-9c35-e115379a2c0c
21,discussion2," The prevalence of AH seems to be rapidly increasing among the Greek population and its prevalence is consistently higher in men than women [27].  Observational studies from as early as the 1990’s have outlined a subtle, though apparent overtime trend towards an unhealthier lifestyle adaptation among the Greek population. In a study performed in 1995, Voukiklaris et al. reported increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia and smoking, accompanied by a respective decrease in heavy physical activity and an impressively higher incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in middle-aged men from rural areas of the island of Crete [28]. Later studies from the same geographical area reported increased prevalence of overweight and obesity among farmers; mean Body mass index (BMI) was an impressive 7 kg/m2 higher when compared to the cohort of the Seven Country Study (SCS) from 40 years earlier [29].",8e1ee500-3604-4199-943b-05773ee90123
22,discussion3," This change was discussed by the authors as being attributable to the gradual establishment of a sedentary life-style, away from high-intensity physical activity and the adoption of unfavorable dietary habits (increased intake of meat and saturated fat, and decrease in fruit consumption) [30, 31], despite the fact that the caloric intake surprisingly decreased overtime [32, 33]. The island of Crete has been in the spotlight of several epidemiologic studies due to the fact that it provided the initial cohort of the Seven Country Study (SCS), based on which the concept of the “Mediterranean diet” was perceived and established. On the other hand, Crete (the 5th largest island of the Mediterranean Sea and the largest island in Greece, having approximately 620,000 permanent inhabitants in 2011), includes large urban centers with several daily connections by airplane and ship to the mainland.",1f7a6b66-55ed-4f70-ba4e-7efc8e0d3897
23,discussion4," Consequently, its epidemiological and geographical characteristics are in no case representative of the population of the Greek islands in general.  In the present study population, although the participants reported some dietary habits representative of the traditional Mediterranean diet, such as the everyday consumption of olive oil or the frequent consumption of fish, they also seem to have adopted several aspects of “Westernized” diet, such as the limited consumption of fruits and vegetables and the frequent consumption of meat and sweets. Overall and according to their median MedDietscore (=25), their habits may be characterized as moderately adherent to the Mediterranean diet. Importantly, a strong, independent association was designated between age and adherence to Mediterranean diet in our population.",5e3bd307-5f03-41c5-a75b-622a49fe2c44
24,discussion5," This finding can be potentially attributed to the changes in lifestyle and occupation which have been observed during the past two decades due to the touristic development of the island. In addition, the island population demonstrated a rather sedentary life-style, with complete lack of physical activity in approximately one fourth of the participants, while only 49% reported some form of physical activity on a daily basis. Interestingly, the participants who exercised reported a more healthy dietary behavior, as physical activity along with age, male sex, level of education, history of hypercholesterolemia and lack of history of diabetes were independently associated with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet.",15218e9e-0f95-4271-87e2-377de7478475
25,discussion6," The association between age and healthier dietary habits has been further corroborated by the findings of another study that highlights age as an independent predictor of adherence to Mediterranean diet in a large cohort of individuals from four randomly selected Greek islands [34]. This could be explained not only by the lower caloric requirements of the elderly population, but, additionally, by their increased resistance in adopting newly introduced “Westernized” dietary and life-style trends. Moreover, one must bear in mind that the greater adherence of the elderly to Christian Orthodox rituals, among which is frequent fasting, may in part explain their healthier eating habits, as previously discussed [35–37].",2db25499-366e-4661-88a8-17e21766ba2b
26,discussion7,"  The association between history of hypercholesterolemia and higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet comes as no surprise, since dietary recommendations against this condition are compatible to the Mediterranean diet patterns, namely increasing intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, as well as reduced intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages and red meat. On the other hand, since the same dietary recommendations also apply for patients with diabetes, the inverse relationship depicted between history of diabetes and adherence to the Mediterranean diet in our population could possibly indicate either the limited access of the Elafonisos inhabitants to specialized, in the field, physicians or lack of adequate compliance on their behalf. The association between male sex and better adherence to the Mediterranean diet is contradictory to previous results [16, 36].",cabfe847-1489-4163-80a8-1e220cddad4f
27,discussion8," However, in the present study, this sex difference was driven by an increased intake of alcohol and fish among men, possibly indicating the special social and occupational characteristics of the study’s population. Furthermore, the positive relationship between level of education and adherence to Mediterranean diet comes as no surprise. Education, as a component of higher socioeconomic status, has been shown to correlate inversely with the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The same findings were confirmed in a recent sub-analysis of the ATTICA population, which showed a significantly higher 10-year incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among individuals with lower (≤9 years) vs higher education (≥15 years) [38]. This positive effect can in part be attributed to the greater ease of access to edifying and behavior-modifying information and programs that education ensures.",55eaa474-807f-4011-be90-641db0451f40
28,discussion9," Additionally, higher education is in general paralleled by higher income; this enables better access to higher quality health facilities.  The notably high prevalence of obesity and both known and screen-detected cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors places the study population at high risk for incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). The relatively low prevalence of reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) (8.4%) among this population merits further investigation, as it could reflect either genetic factors or possible beneficial effects of certain aspects of the Mediterranean diet, such as olive oil and fish consumption or a misinterpretation due to the latent period of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Increased inbreeding, which is frequent among isolated populations, reinforces the possibility that genetic factors may play a pivotal role in the disequilibrium between prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors in our study population.",1c3fc5d0-508f-4cd7-9541-5eb13f2fb2aa
29,discussion10," However, similar trends have been reported in the past among the Greek population. In the ATTICA study, the baseline prevalence of known cardiovascular disease (CVD) was also low compared to the widely prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors [27]. However, cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence during the 5- and 10-year follow-up was as high as 8.5 and 15.7%, respectively [39], raising the total burden of the disease very fast. Consequently, only prospective evaluation during long-term follow-up will help to elucidate the association between risk factors and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this particular population.  Study limitations Due to the cross-sectional nature of this analysis and the single island population included, generalization of the results should be applied with caution before confirmation is available from larger population analyses.",387197b5-b687-4d1c-ad1f-ceee0d4cd799
30,discussion11," However, this does not diminish the significance of our findings, since they clearly show that the inhabitants of a small island of the Mediterranean basin, have adopted “Westernized” lifestyle habits. Although, the cross-sectional analysis does not allow deduction of causal relationships between the study variables, the fact that overweight, obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are highly prevalent among this population cannot be considered a coincidence.  Although other measures of body composition assessment, such as CT scan and MRI are more accurate than bio-impendance, the latter, was used in due to its simplicity, quickness, low cost and non-invasive nature. Bio-impedance can accurately measure body fat, as far as it is used for specific ethnic groups, populations and conditions, which was actually the case in the present study.",17f08885-14bd-4d95-8f4d-12478e611ba1
31,discussion12,"  Finally, although a single measurement of fasting serum glucose for the diagnosis of diabetes is subject to error, in epidemiological studies, one measurement is most often used, due to infeasibility of double measurements. In the present study, individuals with high blood glucose results (in the range of diabetes) were advised to show them to their family physicians in order to receive further instructions.  Conclusions In summary, the prevalence of obesity and classical cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors is high among the inhabitants of a small Eastern Mediterranean island, showing that even isolated rural populations have adapted many aspect of the “Western” lifestyle.",c522f603-2fac-4a3b-bbef-4233ba7bac2d
32,discussion13," This increase, combined with distancing of the population from traditional dietary and life-style habits should ring a bell for all health policy makers; organized, multi-faceted efforts should be made to promote re-adoption of the Mediterranean diet in an attempt to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and improve population’s health.
