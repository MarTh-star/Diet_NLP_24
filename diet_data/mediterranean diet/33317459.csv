0,background0," Weight loss diets continue to rise in popularity; however, the associated costs are seldom reported. Certain weight loss diets may be unaffordable and differ from their traditional nutrition composition to include non-conventional premium products. In contrast, healthy eating principles such as the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE)) and the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) place an emphasis on fresh produce and staple foods but are sometimes thought to be unaffordable. A new methodology was piloted to assess the cost of weight loss diets using seven meal plans. ",144a0689-6282-4c19-9f81-316aa091140e
1,methods0," Identification and introduction of diets  To identify popular diets within Australia, Google Trend Data and grey literature were used during March to April of 2019. Specifications were used including search terms, date (2015–2019), web searches and geographical location (restricted to Australia) as previously published [22]. For similar diets i.e., Optifast and Optislim, the diet with the highest popularity (trending searches and relative search volume) from Google Trend, was selected. This tool has been previously utilised in research [23–28].  The meal plans in this research have previously been published and their nutrition profile reported [22]. The definitions and descriptions provided below are a combination of the diets scientific, or technical classifications, and their modern counterparts which may include foods that once were limited or excluded.  Popular weight loss diets  The Ketogenic diet is a typically a high fat, low to moderate protein, and very low carbohydrate diet.",3f19ef9c-7223-4565-b48a-d26eab10ee0a
2,methods1," The dietary pattern limits glucose from carbohydrates to ensure that fat is the primary energy source, resulting in a metabolic state known as nutritional ketosis [29]. Fruit and vegetables, alongside breads, cereals, legumes, and grains are limited in a ketogenic diet to ensure total carbohydrate intake is typically < 50 g/day [30, 31]. The ketogenic diet has been endorsed by national [32] and international [33–37] bodies and has an established role in dietary management of chronic disease such as type two diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and epilepsy [31]. However, modern day ketogenic diets have become highly popularised and do not necessarily align with the true principles and nutritional guidelines. Modern day ketogenic diets are targeted for weight loss and encourage considerably higher protein intakes from animal products such as beef, chicken, turkey, and protein supplements [38].",d76ea2b0-65b8-42fc-873d-cfc56ed235ca
3,methods2," Further, the sources of fat which forms most of a ketogenic diet are currently from popular higher cost products sources such as coconut oil, butter, cocoa butter, and ghee which have been popularised within mainstream social media [38].  A traditional Palaeolithic diet has no specific macronutrient recommendations. However, it has been hypothesised to be an approximate 27:31:45 macronutrient distribution of protein, carbohydrate, and fat respectively [39]. Due to the limiting of cereal products such as bread, pasta, and rice, for the purpose of the current research it will be referred to as a low carbohydrate diet. Previously known as the ‘caveman diet’, a traditional Palaeolithic diet limits processed foods and has a focus on eating fresh produce [40, 41]. This includes meat, fish, vegetables, seeds, nuts, and fruit. Some modern Palaeolithic diets and meal plans appear to include dairy products and legumes, while others do not.",4a32d90d-3b56-4009-aa42-cc8c20f851f2
4,methods3," The palaeolithic diet has similarly been studied for its cardiometabolic role, weight loss efficacy, increased satiety and ability to beneficially modify the intestinal microbiome [40].  8 Weeks to Wow (8WW) is a challenge style diet with an explicit food list that re-introduces restricted foods over a fortnightly period [18]. The dietary pattern is high in vegetables and protein with small amounts of dairy foods, fruit and breads and cereals. 8WW also includes various low carbohydrate alternatives and specialty products such as konjac (vegetable) rice and noodles, and, high protein bread (Protein Bread Co.)[18].  Intermittent fasting (IF) is also known as time-restricted feeding whereby there is an eating window followed by a period of fasting and abstaining from food. Reducing the eating window is believed to reduce energy intake (calories) due to the closeness of meals, and that fasting will induce a fat-burning state [19, 40].",c725f6e9-4843-4975-aade-5f072b354f38
5,methods4," Daily fasting windows may vary (16:8 or 20:4), or a varying approach may be utilised such as the 5:2 method [42]. The 5:2 method consists of two days of very low-calorie intake (500-600 kcal) followed by ad libitum consumption for the remaining five days. Generally, there are no food group restrictions.  Optifast is a meal replacement program designed for overweight and obese individuals and typically is a precursor for bariatric surgery [43, 44]. Despite this, Optifast products are available over the counter to the general population and are often utilised as a meal replacement weight loss strategy without the supervision of a dietitian or health professional. Optifast meal plans (< 800 kcal – 1500 kcal) can be described as moderate to high protein, moderate carbohydrate and low to moderate fat [43, 44].",d496856e-4c08-44e0-b92b-8fcb716180bc
6,methods5," Further, Optifast meal replacements are considered nutritionally complete, formulated to provide an array of essential vitamins and minerals and adequate protein to preserve lean muscle mass.  Healthy Eating Principles  The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE)) in conjunction with the Australian Dietary Guidelines (Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG)) are evidence-based guidelines which promote a balanced lifestyle and reduce disease risk [45]. The five core food groups contribute to a moderate protein, moderate to high carbohydrate and moderate fat intake. No foods are restricted; however, it is recommended to reduce the intake of high fat, high sugar and high salt products and consume minimal amounts of heavily processed foods and alcohol.  The Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) has been endorsed by the American Dietary Guidelines (2015–2020) as one of three dietary patterns to encourage healthy ageing and reduce disease risk [46, 47].",8bb9687b-e1ce-474d-8b85-3d45a647b1e6
7,methods6," The MedDiet reflects a moderate protein, moderate carbohydrate, and high fat dietary pattern [20, 46]. A Mediterranean dietary pattern focuses on consuming ample amounts of olive oil, fruit, vegetables, cereals, wholegrains, legumes and smaller amounts of fish, eggs, and meat.  Dietary Input  The full protocol has been previously published [22]. In brief, where various energy intakes (kJ/kcal) were available for diets, the most ‘suitable’ meal plan was selected based on the premise of weight loss (i.e., approximately 6090 kJ/1500 kcal). For example, the Optifast meal replacement program offers various ‘levels’ and energy targets. The 5040 kJ/1200 kcal meal plan was considered the most appropriate as 6300 kJ/1500 kcal is the ‘maintenance level’ and does not include any Optifast products. The 3360 kJ/800 kcal and 4200 kJ/1000 kcal meal plan were considered too drastic an energy deficit for an individual with a healthy body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and therefore not selected.",a2a3d110-5c01-46ad-bf62-74ba5577b25e
8,methods7,"  Meal plans were entered into Foodworks Professional Dietary Software V9 (Xyris, Queensland, Australia) for analysis as previously described [22]. Where ingredients were missing or unavailable, the closest alternative was entered. The full dietary pattern for 8WW was entered to provide insight into the overall nutrition profile and cost. The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) did not have a specific meal plan but alternatively provided two exemplar days. The remaining five days were developed from available recipes provided by the Eat for Health website and the NHMRC.  Cost methodology  To determine if there were any differences in food costs between two Australian leading supermarkets Coles and Woolworths, a random number generator was used to select N = 6 ingredients from each meal plan (N = 42 total). The same ingredients were costed for Coles and Woolworths and only recorded once to maintain consistency. The cost per gram between supermarkets was negligible (0.01 cents).",4dc56523-eca6-4d70-af40-25930a462fcb
9,methods8,"  Foodworks data was exported into Microsoft Access. Ingredients were then sorted and collated prior to transferring into Microsoft Excel. While collating, the sum total of each ingredient that was used throughout the seven-day meal plan was calculated. Each diet was allocated a separate sheet where all ingredients were recorded once and listed alphabetically to ensure there were no duplicates. Ingredients from the excel spreadsheet were then cross-checked with the original exported list in Microsoft Access to ensure no ingredients were missing.  Details were then recorded from Coles Australia during July to August of 2019 including the unit size (mg, g, kg, mL, L), the cost of the unit ($) and the brand name. It was expected that all items noted in the meal plans would require purchasing including pantry staples such as salt, pepper, and cooking oils.",d7bd0192-02a6-4a38-8dc4-6a0e57d4ceee
10,methods9," Once the details of a single ingredient were obtained, it was incorporated into all meal plans to ensure consistency and accuracy as some ingredients can be purchased at various unit sizes. Further, to maintain consistency in the cost calculations, items on sale were avoided when possible and ‘middle’ range brands were used as opposed to premium or home-brand. However, in some circumstances, brand names may have been ‘temporarily unavailable’ therefore missing a price or were the same price as the home brand alternative. Furthermore, certain meal plans had non-specific ingredients such as ‘stock cubes’, therefore the average from multiple types of stock cube i.e. chicken, beef and vegetable were taken.  Average weights for fruits and vegetables that were not available pre-packaged with a designated weight-related price, were acquired from the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ)) food measures database [48].",77d5e205-a995-464a-8243-9b4b8dc099f3
11,methods10," The database provides approximate recorded weights of fresh produce that were used in the 2011–2013 Australian Health Survey and assisted in calculating the cost.  Once all ingredients had the required information in the excel spreadsheet, the cost per gram was calculated by dividing the cost by the unit size. For example, 400 g of almonds costs $10 and the cost per gram is $0.025. The cost per gram was calculated for all ingredients and then multiplied by the grams per week of the ingredient required by the meal plan from Foodworks Dietary Software program (Xyris, Australia) to calculate the cost per week. For example, 8WW requires 367 g of almonds over the entire meal plan ($0.025 × 367 g) with the cost per week totalling $9.20 for this specific ingredient. Once this was repeated for all ingredients, the sum was taken and resulted in the cost of the meal plan per week based on absolute grams.",83488cc5-d36d-48f0-9316-8c56814db64e
12,methods11,"  Calculating the cost per meal plan based on absolute grams allowed standardisation amongst diets. But, as the meal plans require purchasing of entire unit sizes i.e. 400 g although only requiring 367 g, calculating the total cost of the grocery shop per week was integral as some ingredients would need purchasing of multiple units to meet the grams per week from the meal plan. This was evident in 8WW due to the increased frequency of meat consumption such as steak (fillet/blade) that was sold as $8/240 g and would require purchasing 8 units to meet the 1.8 kg requirement from the meal plan.  Proportion (%) of income and contribution ($,%) from Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) food groups  The average weekly income for an Australian adult before tax ($1659) as of February 2020 was applied to determine the percentage of average income required for diets [49]. A higher proportion of income was deemed less desirable as this indicates increased costs of a diet.",0c077121-98e6-4379-bc8c-9120c585c454
13,methods12,"  The final spreadsheet was used to determine the contribution in terms of cost ($) per food group and proportion of grocery shop (%) from the five Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) food groups. Ingredients were allocated to one of the core five food groups, or, ‘other’ which represented the remaining ingredients which did not fit into the five food groups. The ‘other’ group included ingredients such as herbs and spices, condiments, oils, and alcoholic beverages. Once ingredients were listed under their respective food group, the cost was collated for ingredients i.e. the cost of apricots, apples, bananas, and all other sources of fruit, for each meal plan. To determine the percentage of cost for each food group, the total cost per food group was then divided by the total cost of the weekly shop. For example, across one week of the 8WW meal plan, fruit had an associated cost of $33 from the total $345 which equates to 9% of the total grocery shop.",4125b0ee-9ff7-4939-833e-46cc95563f94
14,methods13,"  Though tomato and avocados are classified botanically as a fruit, both are labelled as a vegetable according to the Western Australian Department of Health (Healthy WA) and are traditionally ‘used’ as a vegetable in main meals [50]. Further, the Queensland Healthy Food Access Basket (QLD Healthy Food Access Basket (HFAB)) displayed both tomatoes and avocadoes within the vegetables food group [51] and was used to assess diets against reference costs.  Legumes and beans are categorised into both the vegetable food group and the lean meats and alternatives food group as per the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE). But, considering the QLD Healthy Food Access Basket (HFAB) was used as a reference, legumes were considered part of the vegetable group for this particular calculation to ensure consistency [51].",828399fb-13ba-46ec-a4fd-607525e8ce49
15,methods14,"  In the circumstance that meal plans included foods that are non-traditional sources of an Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) food group, for example, konjac noodles, or, protein pizza bases, and other pseudo-grains, these products were presented in the discretionary category.

16,results0," Cost of meal plans, grocery shop and proportion of income  The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) WL was the cheapest meal plan at $93 per week followed by ketogenic and the MedDiet WL at $112 per week. (Table 1) 8WW had the highest cost per week at $192, $100 more than the cheapest meal plan.Table 1 Summary table of the cost of meal plans per week based on ingredients and absolute grams, the cost of the total food shop per week, and, cost of each diet expressed as a percentage of average income ($)  Diet	Cost of Meal Plan Per Week ($/g)	Total cost of food shop per week ($)	(%) average incomeb	 Ketogenic	111.70	475.90	28.7	 Palaeolithic	114.30	435.00	26.2	 Intermittent Fasting	118.90	475.90	28.7	 8 Weeks to Wowa	192.40	345.30	20.8	 Optifast	125.10	624.90	37.7	 MedDiet WL	112.00	452.00	27.2	 Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) WL	93.10	404.40	24.",23a8be61-8fa5-47c8-b3b9-9af9228eaac8

As food cannot be purchased in exact gram amounts needed for recipes and meal plans, it requires the purchasing of a whole packet, or ‘unit’ that the food manufacturer has established (i.e. a 400 g can of chickpeas or a 250 g bag of almond meal) which affects the total cost.",1093b3db-c14c-4716-8490-19fc16b86453
18,results2," The second cheapest grocery shop per week was 8WW ($345), however, this is the average over eight weeks and variation within weekly grocery shops will occur due to the reintroduction of foods. Contrastingly, the most expensive total cost was Optifast, costing > $600, followed by ketogenic and intermittent fasting ($476/week) (Table 1).  The proportion of income required for the total grocery shop ranged from 21% (8WW) to 38% (Optifast) with a higher proportion of income viewed as a negative outcome. Optifast was the only diet to surpass the 30% income threshold with the majority (4/7) of other diets falling between 25 to ≤ 30% income (Table 1).  Highest contributions to cost per diet and non Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) Food Groups  The most expensive ingredients for most diets were animal proteins such as chicken breast, salmon, steak, canned tuna and lamb.",fe7cc53f-42c8-4747-bd97-2acb01cab891
19,results3," The ketogenic meal plan included a whey protein supplement ($23/400 g) and cocoa butter ($13/250 g) which were the highest contributors to cost for the ketogenic meal plan. Similarly, Optifast products are unable to be sourced from supermarkets, but can be found in Australian chemists and pharmacies, at a higher expense ($45-$65/636 g-954 g depending on the flavour and unit size). The purchasing of multiple different flavours within the meal plan provided an additional cost.  Interestingly, the three most expensive ingredients from the intermittent fasting meal plan were non-animal-based products, chia seeds (black and white) and coffee powder. The Intermittent Fasting meal plan had a significant amount of food and beverage products that did not fit into the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) categories ($233 of total food cost) (Table 2).",a039a632-cfe7-4b87-ab3a-ba0757551a7f
20,results4," The majority of these products and ingredients consisted of herbs such as mint, parsley, oregano, chilli, cinnamon, cloves, and, sauces including soy sauce, sriracha, tabasco sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Similarly, The ketogenic meal plan, ‘other’ category also had a high-cost contribution, requiring up to $289 of the total food cost per week (Table 2). This included a range of high fat dairy products (cocoa butter, double cream and ghee) and high salt products (prosciutto, bacon, pork rind). In a similar manner, the palaeolithic meal plan consisted of a range of high saturated fat coconut products such as coconut cream, coconut milk and coconut oil, but, did not include traditional dairy food sources. A range of dairy food alternatives such as almond milk and soy cheese were included as part of the meal plan, with an associated increased cost.",8b9d9297-b61e-4564-bf0a-c334369fe90f

22,results7,"  The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE), MedDiet and Optifast meal plans had a cost associated with alcohol for cooking purposes and was within the topmost expensive products (white wine, brandy, and dry sherry).  Cost of total grocery shop by Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) food group  Fruit from meal plans contributed to 8–21% of the total weekly grocery shop or $15-$47 while vegetables contributed 22–60% ($41-$134) (Table 2). Breads, grains, and cereals had the lowest proportion of spending allocated ranging from nil to 14%, or $0-$35, while lean meats, poultry, and seafood, generally had the highest cost contribution ($20-$141) and proportion (9–59%).  The MedDiet WL, Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) WL and Intermittent Fasting had similar proportions of cost attributed to each food group and were similar to that of the QLD Healthy Food Access Basket (HFAB) (Table 2).",f55e23ea-5c33-48f6-a51b-fdd04d7c5814
23,results8," The ketogenic and palaeolithic meal plans had similar cost proportions for fruit (8%), vegetables (22–33%), and the lean meats and poultry Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) food group (52–59%). Further, both diets excluded breads, cereals and grains and therefore had no contribution to total cost. The palaeolithic meal plan additionally had no contribution from dairy and alternatives and differed substantially from the QLD Healthy Food Access Basket (HFAB).  8WW and Optifast required similar amounts for breads, grains, and cereals (1–3% or between $2–10), compared to the QLD Healthy Food Access Basket (HFAB) (13% or $16), but differed noticeably in regard to lean meats and poultry (48% compared to 9%) and vegetables (60% compared to 25%) (Table 2).

24,discussion0," In this study, the cost of the seven meal plans ranged from $93-193AUD (exact grams). The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating meal plan was the least expensive and 8 Weeks to Wow was the most expensive. Weekly grocery shopping of entire units cost between $345-$625AUD, over $100AUD which is substantially higher than the spending habits of an average Australian.  Countless meal plans for different weight loss diets exist due to consumer demand. However, not all meal plans are affordable, nor do they necessarily follow their original nutritional foundations. Namely, modern day ketogenic and palaeolithic weight loss meal plans appear to have a focus on high protein (from animal sources) and include a variety of low carbohydrate replacements and premium products which wouldn’t typically be included as part of either dietary pattern. Resultingly, these low carbohydrate meal plans may appear to be of a higher cost and unobtainable.",c91e586f-ed8c-4768-852c-55e93cb88613
25,discussion1," Further, the Optifast meal plan utilised multiple different flavours of meal replacement which may be a useful strategy for diet adherence, but may be unaffordable, requiring a higher proportion of income. Additionally, the intermittent fasting meal plan which one would anticipate as cost-saving due to decreased food intake, included specialty and organic products, which add an additional expense and may not be necessary for weight loss. Access to information concerning the cost of meal plans and weight loss diets may assist in better informing consumers.  Cost in relation to food security, income and Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) good groups  Highly priced diets and meal plans may be financial barriers for some Australians. Food insecurity affects up to 5% of Australians at any given time and refers to an inadequate access to food that is affordable and culturally appropriate [52–54].",1c4058e2-9539-40fc-b96b-9ab7b03afe49
26,discussion2," However, according to Foodbank, the largest food relief organisation in Australia, up to one fifth (21%) of the population may be experiencing food insecurity [55]. Food insecurity can be intensified during global pandemics such as COVID-19. According to the latest FoodBank report, the main groups that were accessing food relief have diversified with the increase of vulnerable Australian’s due to job cuts, businesses closing and lockdowns [56]. Previously, predominantly unemployed, homeless and single-parent families were accessing food relief; however, this has now expanded to include international students and casual workers [56].  For low-income earners, money dedicated to food shopping is not normally prioritised as housing expenses, fuel and power, health care, rent repayments and income tax are of a higher priority [9, 57]. Research suggests spending greater than 25% of disposable income on groceries and food supplies can lead to food insecurity [58–60].",e614493a-0ba0-447f-aab4-c94964864067
27,discussion3," However, a healthy diet can cost between 21–30% of disposable income for low-income families [9].  The Optifast meal plan required a significant proportion of income. However, previous research using partial meal replacements (Slim-Fast Foods Co) indicated that there may be suitability for lower income earners [61]. Further, previous research has indicated that weight loss diets and diets that follow a low-carbohydrate high-fat pattern are costly [62, 63]. One study reported the feasibility of a palaeolithic diet for low-income earners. The results found that a palaeolithic diet is of a higher cost ($0.23/100 g) compared to the observed diet of Americans ($0.17/100 g) [62], but, could still be feasible for low-income earners within the constraints of the thrifty food program, in this specific circumstance [62]. Further, Zinn et al.",15a3d2d8-d9bd-4e86-9443-19d7a65a8c83
28,discussion4," (2020) [63] compared the cost of a meal plan based on the ministry of health (ministry of health (MOH)) nutrition guidelines and a LCHF diet similar to that of a palaeolithic or ketogenic diet. Comparable to that of the current research, the lack of traditional carbohydrate sources (grain foods) in low carbohydrate diets resulted in increased proportions of grocery shopping from other food groups, namely lean meats, poultry, and ‘other’. However, there are dietitian and medical professional led organisations such as the Noakes Foundation and Low Carb 4 Families which tailor culturally appropriate low carbohydrate dietary patterns for lower income population groups.  Cost in relation to healthy food basket initiatives, and, home-brand compared to name-brand  In hopes to reduce the inequality of access to healthy diets according to socioeconomic status (SES), state, regional and community initiatives to improve access to healthy foods have been piloted and implemented [57, 60, 64, 65].",b94ce8fb-8b27-468f-9c72-82544dca56ce
29,discussion5," American initiatives such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)), previously referred to as food stamps, and food baskets, provide assistance and access to nutritious foods for low socioeconomic status (SES) families at a federal level [66]. Similarly, Australian government initiatives such as the Healthy Food Access Basket (Healthy Food Access Basket (HFAB)) in Queensland (2014), demonstrate the ability and achievability of constructing a nutritionally adequate, low cost food basket that is in line with recommendations (Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE))[51, 67]. Further, in Australia, a goods and services tax (goods and services tax (GST)) of approximately 10% is added to most non-core foods that are processed including pre-prepared foods, confectionary, savoury snacks, bakery products and sugar-sweetened beverages (sugar sweetened beverages (SSB)) [9, 59].",abc7bf2d-252c-49bf-80b6-88e3682f6765
30,discussion6," Most core and staple foods such as fruit, vegetables, bread, meat and poultry, and, dairy foods (milk and eggs) are non-taxable (goods and services tax (GST)-free) in an effort to avoid any goods and services tax (GST) related price rises on these foods [9–11]. However, this research demonstrates that certain diets and meal plans tend to require a lower proportion of weekly grocery costs from the five core food groups.  Affordability of diets and food is also influenced by purchasing tendencies [68]. Purchasing organic foods and premium products can increase costs dramatically [68] as noted in 8WW, which required purchasing of Protein Bread Co products, large amounts of chicken breast, lean beef and quark (a dairy product comparable to cream cheese). Similarly, the Optifast meal plan recommended a variety of meal replacement flavours requiring the purchase of multiple boxes ($45-$60 per flavour depending on the unit size).",76ec506b-8e65-4b8c-82a2-2da1799e7dbd
31,discussion7," In addition, the ketogenic meal plan included two different flavours of premium brand whey protein isolate (whey protein isolate (WPI)) which wouldn’t typically be part of a ketogenic diet. The remaining diets also had premium and or unusual products which were difficult to source a price from Coles, Australia. This included soy cheese (palaeolithic), cocoa butter (ketogenic), liquid smoke sauce (ketogenic), bliss balls (Intermittent Fasting), organic corn chips (Intermittent Fasting) and vine leaves (MedDiet).  In contrast, purchasing generic brands and non-premium products can decrease costs by up to 13% ($23-$32) per week [65]. When the Queensland Healthy Food Access Basket (HFAB) was adjusted to include generic brands, the cost of the basket reduced by 18% ($11.40), resulting in an annual saving of $594 [51, 67]. For example, almonds, a common food product in all meal plans differs substantially in price depending on Coles brand ($17.50/1 kg) or name-brand ($22.00/1 kg).",4e78d1bb-0725-4265-a34a-36f34893ed67
32,discussion8," Similarly, per kilogram of chicken breast, choosing home brand ($12.00/kg) can result in a saving of almost $20 compared to the premium equivalent ($31.50/kg). In addition, frozen goods and bulk buying can reduce costs, and may result in increased affordability of the researched diets [69]. However, although a cost saving idea in theory, bulk-buying may only be appropriate for non-perishable (staple items) such as grains, legumes, rice, pasta, and canned goods, and requires adequate space for storage. Staple items are often excluded from popular weight loss diet trends such as a modernised Ketogenic and Palaeolithic diet and 8WW and therefore this strategy may not influence food costs.  Access to information regarding the costs of certain diets and the proportion of income required to undertake such dietary patterns could be a useful tool to inform health professionals and consumers.",ae556510-2090-4c2b-98e2-cfd826f4390b
33,discussion9," This information may assist in decision making and provide a deeper understanding of the financial costs of currently popular diets in Australia, addressing a gap in the literature. Further, this information could help to determine the suitability for certain groups and populations such as low-income earners, students, retirees and health-conscious consumers and the relevant risk for food insecurity.  Limitations and conclusions  Previous research has estimated the cost of dietary patterns and meal plans, weight loss medications (Orlistat), weight loss programs (Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers) and meal delivery services (Lite N Easy, DineWise ©, Diet to Go©, Chef’s Diet™) [17, 70–73]. However, methodologies and cost calculations differed as some used mathematical optimisation models, others were based solely on the cost of meal plans and delivery fees, or medications over a certain timepoint [17, 62, 70–73]. Further, the units differed between research articles.",f3e36c7c-4811-47b8-9cf1-08fc9e10c86b
34,discussion10," Units and reporting of cost results ranged from timepoint i.e. per three months, five days, twenty-eight days, caloric level i.e. 1200 kcal compared to 1800 kcal, cost per kilogram of weight lost, cost per meal, and cost per week based on the quantity of sessions with a health professional required to achieve the desired weight loss [17, 71, 73, 74]. It was therefore difficult in some circumstances to compare the results of previous research to the current research.  The definition and cost of a healthy diet is relatively inconsistent in the literature. But, the healthy food baskets and government assistance programs from various governments can act as a reference point and cost comparator for weight loss diets due to the inclusion of core foods that align with dietary guidelines.",8ac820f0-cedd-4d09-babe-c5426784a3cf
35,discussion11," Though some meal plans such as 8WW and ketogenic required premium specialty products and are more expensive than healthy eating principles by up to almost AUD$100, they may not put Australians at the risk of food security as they are below the 30% of income threshold. However, individuals have different priorities regarding disposable income, and, the cost required to undertake a certain dietary pattern may be appealing based on these results, or, a concern and viewed as a financial barrier.
