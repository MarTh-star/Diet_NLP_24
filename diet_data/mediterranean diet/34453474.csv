0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Protocol  We performed a cross-sectional study of 2967 consecutive women with overweight and obesity referring to the International Center for Nutritional Status Assessment (International Center for the Assessment of Nutritional Status (ICANS), University of Milan, Milan, Italy) from September 2010 to February 2020, to devise a nutritional assessment and obtain a personalized dietary intervention to lose weight. The study was conducted following the guidelines established by the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee of the University of Milan approved the study procedures (study protocol No. 23/2016). Patients gave written informed consent for the use of their data for research purposes.  The inclusion criteria were: women, age ≥ 18 years, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and alcohol intake ≤ 20 g/day.",ef4f85ed-7ae0-4641-b680-cf1b693a6137
1,methods1," The exclusion criteria were: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer within the past 5 years, hepatitis C virus infection, hepatitis B virus infection, liver cirrhosis, neurological disease, gastrointestinal disease, cardiac failure, renal failure, pulmonary insufficiency and use of drugs known to cause lipodystrophy.  The patients underwent a clinical history and a physical examination. An appointed physician collected the data on the personal and family occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and other chronic disease, previous and current pharmacological treatment, menopausal status, blood pressure and lifestyle habits, such as smoking and structured physical activity. Blood pressure was measured using international guidelines. Such guidelines changed during the study period but not with regard to the method of measurement of blood pressure. Women reporting absence of menstrual cycle for at least 12 months were defined as postmenopausal.",6faa7f28-4353-4c04-83d3-a6463f6440c3
2,methods2,"  A fasting blood sample was drawn between 08:30 and 09:00 AM for the measurement of blood glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total-, low-density-lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL))-, high-density-lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL))-cholesterol and alanine transaminase (alanine transaminase (ALT)), aspartate transaminase (aspartate transaminase (AST)) and gamma-glutamyl-transferase (gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT)).  Thereafter, an experienced physician measured the thicknesses of visceral adipose tissue (visceral adipose tissue (VAT)) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)) at the abdominal level using ultrasonography (Logiq 3 Pro, GE Healthcare, Boston, MA, USA) with a 7.5 MHz linear probe and a 3.5 MHz convex-array probe. The measurements, recorded at the end of expiration, were taken 1 cm above the umbilicus.",fd5f9e40-ebf5-4e70-b1be-89e4882f928f
3,methods3," visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was defined as the distance between the posterior surface of the rectus abdominis muscle and the anterior wall of the aorta. subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) was defined as the distance between the external face of the rectus abdominis muscle and the epidermis [26,27].  Lastly, a registered dietitian took anthropometric measurements following international guidelines [28]. Weight was measured with an electronic scale with an accuracy of 100 g (Seca 700, Seca Corporation, Hamburg, Germany). Height was measured with a vertical stadiometer with an accuracy of 0.1 cm. Waist circumference (WC) was measured with an accuracy of 0.5 cm using a nonelastic tape placed at the midpoint between the last rib and the iliac crest. The thicknesses of four skinfolds (biceps, triceps, subscapular and suprailiac) were measured using a skinfold caliper (Holtan Ltd., Crymych, Wales). Fat mass was estimated from the Durnin–Womersley equation [29].",1abd99ab-1c84-4dd0-a012-22a81641601a
4,methods4, Percent fat mass (%FM) was calculated as (fat mass (kg)/body weight (kg)) × 100.  Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to the harmonized definition [30].  2.2. Outcome Assessment  Fatty liver status was evaluated using the following non-invasive indices: Fatty liver index (Fatty liver index (FLI)) [31] = eLP/(1 + eLP) × 100 where LP (linear predictor) = 0.953 × ln(triglycerides (mg/dL)) + 0.139 × BMI (kg/m2) + 0.718 × ln (gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) (U/L)) + 0.053 × WC (cm) − 15.745;  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease–fatty liver steatosis (Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-FLS) [32] = −2.89 + 1.18 × Metabolic syndrome (0 = No; 1 = Yes) + 0.45 × type 2 diabetes mellitus (2 = Yes; 0 = No) + 0.15 × insulin (mU/L) + 0.04 × aspartate transaminase (AST) (U/L) − 0.,5330fa4c-4fdb-4800-b0f1-560770859c0b
5,methods5,"94 × aspartate transaminase (AST) (U/L)/alanine transaminase (ALT) (U/L);  Hepatic steatosis index (hepatic steatosis index (HSI)) [33] = 8 × (alanine transaminase (ALT) (U/L)/aspartate transaminase (AST) (U/L)) + BMI (kg/m2) + 2 if woman + 2 if diabetes mellitus.  2.3. Mediterranean Diet Adherence  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated using the 14-item Mediterranean diet adherence screener (Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS)), a short questionnaire developed and validated in the PREDIMED trial [34]. Such questionnaire investigates food preferences and the frequency of consumption of foods typical of the Mediterranean diet and of Western diets. For each item, one point is assigned if the Mediterranean criterion is met, as reported in Supplementary Table S1 [35,36,37]. The score of Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) ranges from 0 to 14 points.  2.4.",e4eccf2a-04f3-4435-b8ca-df88828b1210
6,methods6," Statistical Analysis  As most continuous variables were not normally distributed, all are presented as median and interquartile range. Discrete variables are presented as frequency and percentage. Linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between the Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) score (continuous) and fatty liver indices. Age (continuous), BMI class (discrete; 0 = overweight, 1 = obesity), %FM (continuous), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (continuous), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) (continuous), total cholesterol (continuous), high density lipoprotein (HDL) (continuous), glucose (continuous), menopausal status (discrete, 0 = premenopausal, 1 = postmenopausal), smoking (discrete; 0 = non-smoker, 1 = ex-smoker, 2 = smoker), physical activity (discrete; 0 = no, 1 = at least 2 h/week), statins (discrete, 0 = no, 1 = yes) were included as potential confounders.",1827fa42-0092-4bb8-8e82-a1b66ae3bbd8
7,methods7," To evaluate the association of the Mediterranean diet with fatty liver, a BMI × Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) (discrete x continuous) interaction was added to the models; because the BMI × Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) interaction was significant for all models, we reported the results separately for each BMI class. No evidence of multicollinearity was found among the predictors. Multivariable fractional polynomials were used to model non-linear associations of continuous predictors with the outcome. Because we found some violations of the homoscedasticity assumption in some regression models, robust confidence intervals were calculated for all models [23]. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).  3. Results  The measurements of the patients stratified by BMI category are reported in Table 1.",d48de339-031a-4b75-bc58-3571cd298f93
8,methods8,"  Table 2 reports the association of the Mediterranean diet score with fatty liver indices.  Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) was associated with the indices of fatty liver, but the magnitude of the association differed among the BMI classes. In women with obesity, a 1-point increase in Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) was associated with a 0.60 reduction in Fatty liver index (FLI) (95% CI: −1.04; −0.16, p = 0.008), a 0.092 reduction in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-FLS (95% CI: −0.134; −0.049, p < 0.001) and a 0.17 reduction in hepatic steatosis index (HSI) (95% CI: −0.30; −0.04, p = 0.011). In women with overweight, a 1-point increase in Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) was associated with a 0.034 reduction in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-FLS (95% CI: −0.057; −0.010, p = 0.",ca04a186-b559-4c3d-b27f-82cef8b9e01b
9,methods9,"005), while no association between the Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) score and Fatty liver index (FLI) and hepatic steatosis index (HSI) was found. Figure 1 shows the marginal mean of indices of fatty liver associated with the Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) score in women with overweight and obesity.  Given the impact of menopause on body composition and metabolism, we also stratified the analysis for the menopausal status (Table 3).  In premenopausal women with obesity, Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) was inversely associated with all indices of fatty liver, while in postmenopausal women, Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) was inversely associated only with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-FLS (−0.077, 95% CI: −0.148; −0.007, p = 0.032, for 1-unit increase).",ad2d87c1-3841-49db-a26c-81973285412e
10,methods10," In women with overweight, Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) was stably associated with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-FLS, independently of menopausal status. Figure 2 shows the marginal means of indices of fatty liver associated with Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) in pre- and postmenopausal women with overweight and obesity.  4. Discussion  Non-invasive fatty liver indices are commonly used in clinical practice as simple and accurate tools to screen for Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), especially when imaging techniques are not available. Among them, Fatty liver index (FLI) and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-FLS have been extensively validated in external populations [4]. Recently, hepatic steatosis index (HSI) has also been externally validated and has been found to perform similarly to the Fatty liver index (FLI) in predicting Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [38].",3c2bb5a6-0764-4923-85b1-ad1090704771
11,methods11," In the present study, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower indices of fatty liver in women with overweight and obesity, suggesting that diet quality, even without energy restriction, might promote liver health despite excess body weight. These findings are consistent with those of trials showing that the Mediterranean diet lowers liver fat in people with obesity, even without energy restriction and weight loss [21]. Therefore, choosing a Mediterranean diet as dietary intervention to achieve weight loss might improve liver health, even if it fails to improve weight status. Taken together, these findings may have relevance for public health and may be useful to draft nutritional guidelines aimed at the prevention and management of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  The exact pathophysiological pathway leading to fat accumulation in the liver is not entirely clear [39].",fb0f9c62-0c70-4604-9429-ed0b0509a53c
12,methods12," However, the prevailing view is that it occurs as a result of an initial alteration of insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, which would lead to uninhibited lipolysis, which, in turn, produces increased fatty acid (FA) flow to the liver and other organs (e.g., muscle) [40]. It is estimated that 60% of the triglycerides in the liver come from adipose tissue [41]. visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is the main source of FA to the liver [42,43]. In subjects with obesity, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) delivers 20% of total fatty acid intake to the liver, as compared to 5% in lean subjects [44]. Peripheral insulin resistance also enhances hepatic de novo lipogenesis [45,46], increasing hepatic triglyceride accumulation. This pathway accounts for 25% of hepatic triglyceride content [41,47].",9cff52cc-7045-4d89-9017-d10a4f996a9c
13,methods13," This may, in turn, lead to dysregulation of Vlow density lipoprotein (LDL) production and secretion [48,49,50], which would be increased as a compensatory response to intrahepatocyte triglyceride accumulation, although this pathway seems to be insufficient to normalize the elevated hepatic triglyceride content [40]. The mechanisms proposed to explain the impact of Mediterranean diet on hepatic fat deposition involve the ability of diet to regulate general and visceral adiposity, as well as the specific biochemical processes occurring in the liver. In fact, it has been previously reported that there is an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the amount of abdominal visceral fat [23,51].",e35b5298-b343-47f1-a1d9-d17c83ce1898
14,methods14," Moreover, as a result of higher consumption of fruits and vegetables and olive oil, individuals following the Mediterranean diet have higher intakes of dietary polyphenols and monounsaturated fatty acids, which have been shown to inhibit de novo lipogenesis and improve peripheral insulin sensitivity, mainly through their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects [52,53,54,55]. The Mediterranean diet is also characterized by high consumption of fish and seafood, which contributes to increased intake of omega-3 PUFAs, which have been shown to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation and improve liver enzymes and insulin sensitivity, as well as having anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, low omega-3 PUFAs intake has been correlated with the development of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and progression to non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis [56,57,58].",09881381-2422-4909-85db-761c28d8052a
15,methods15," In addition, the high fiber content of the Mediterranean diet may positively influence body weight and the composition of the gut microbiota [59] by increasing the levels of bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate and propionate, which have been shown to have insulin-sensitizing effects [60,61]. The Mediterranean diet is also low in saturated fats, which have been shown to enhance de novo lipogenesis, insulin resistance and increased hepatic triglyceride content [62,63,64]. On the other hand, women not following the Mediterranean diet may have a higher consumption of ultra-processed foods [65], whose consumption has been associated with overweight and obesity [66], visceral fat accumulation [67], insulin resistance, diabetes [68,69] and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [70].  Our results also show a stronger inverse association between Mediterranean diet and fatty liver indices in women with obesity than in women with overweight.",8f6bef5d-635b-4a84-a5c3-d1f3ec0ccde9
16,methods16," Women with obesity had higher fatty liver indices than overweight women who had a medium–low risk of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), i.e., a median Fatty liver index (FLI) < 30. Clinical trials have shown that the Mediterranean diet, in addition to reducing liver fat, improves insulin sensitivity and helps the reversion of metabolic syndrome, even without weight loss [21,71]. It follows that women at high risk of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may benefit more from increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Unlike the other fatty liver indices studied here, Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-FLS does not include body weight and considers metabolic parameters, including insulin and metabolic syndrome. It is therefore possible that this index is more sensitive to the effect of diet quality, especially without weight loss.",a52e16eb-3b26-4e15-b0c7-7e2eec3954aa
17,methods17," This may explain why Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-FLS was inversely associated with Mediterranean diet adherence in both women with overweight and obesity, while such association was detected for Fatty liver index (FLI) and hepatic steatosis index (HSI) only in women with obesity. The same fact could explain the lack of association between Fatty liver index (FLI), hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and Mediterranean diet in postmenopausal women. Menopause is accompanied by a physiological redistribution of adipose tissue, which tends to accumulate preferentially at the abdominal level. Therefore, the inclusion of parameters such as BMI and waist circumference could mitigate the association between fatty liver indices and adherence to the Mediterranean diet in postmenopausal women.  To the best of our knowledge, no study has assessed the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and fatty liver indices in women with overweight and obesity.",c30fcfa9-5f66-43af-aba3-4ab87841fc16
18,methods18," In addition to its novelty, the present work has some strengths. First, the data are from a large population. Second, we used indices of fatty liver that have been externally validated and shown to have good and similar predictive abilities. Third, we controlled for a wide range of covariates, body composition and abdominal fat distribution, metabolic status and lifestyle, all variables that may impact metabolic status and risk of fatty liver. However, our study is not without limitations. First, a cross-sectional study design cannot prove a cause–effect relationship. Second, although we chose externally validated fatty liver indices, the use of such indices does not allow for the exact separation of individuals with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from those without. However, compared to liver biopsy, these indices are non-invasive, simple to use in clinical practice and cost effective.",f9be0aa8-66fd-4977-bb08-904112964696
19,methods19," In addition, some of them, such as the Fatty liver index (FLI) and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-FLS, are recommended by several European scientific societies for liver health screening in large epidemiological studies and when imaging techniques are not available [4]. Third, body composition was assessed using surrogate techniques, such as skinfold thickness measurement and ultrasonography. Body skinfolds are largely used in clinical practice but provide only an estimation of total body fat. Ultrasonography provides the thickness, not the area, of abdominal fat compartments. However, some studies show a good association between ultrasound measurements and areas measured by reference methods, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging [26,72]. Fourth, although it is valuable for its designed aim, the Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) questionnaire is a short dietary screener and therefore considers only the consumption of few specific foods [34].",a78c3d69-027b-4c8b-8963-104df81c181b
20,methods20," Fifth, our sample included only Caucasian individuals, so these results need confirmation in individuals of other ethnicities.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, the Mediterranean diet is inversely associated with indices of fatty liver in women with overweight and obesity. Women with obesity, especially during the premenopausal period, may benefit more from following a Mediterranean-style diet. Nevertheless, the Mediterranean diet could also improve liver health in overweight and postmenopausal women. These findings should be confirmed by randomized clinical trials using, at the very least, imaging techniques to diagnose Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
