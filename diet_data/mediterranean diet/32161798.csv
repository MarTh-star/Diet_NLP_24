0,methods0," Study design and participants  This study is part of a randomised and controlled eight-week intervention trial whose primary outcome was to detect changes in fasting plasma lipids and faecal levels of short-chain fatty acids upon an intervention with MD, as described in a previous paper [9]. That paper also reported the details of the study design and protocol [9]. In this paper for the first time, we focused on secondary outcome, such as plasma ECs and NAEs, OEA/AEA and OEA/PEA ratios. Specifically, we analysed their changes in response to the dietary intervention, concomitant with gut microbiome changes and their correlations with variables related to diet (food categories, nutritional composition and adherence to the Mediterranean diet), insulin resistance (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, HOMA-IR [24] and systemic inflammation (serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein, hs-CRP).",43e73493-81f8-4792-8dfb-c276f86de89d
1,methods1," The study was conducted after the approval of the University of Naples Ethic Committee (Protocol number: 108/16). The trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (number NCT03071718). Recruitment was performed at the Department of Agricultural Sciences and at the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery of the University of Naples, Naples, Italy.  The 334 potentially eligible adults, interested in study participation, were screened on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria considering medical and lifestyle conditions [9]. Briefly, subjects were included if they were healthy men or women aged between 20 ≤ age ≤ 65 years, with Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 24 kg/m2, consuming a diet characterised by an intake of fruits and vegetables ≤ 3 servings/day, no consumption of probiotics, functional foods and/or food supplements, consuming no more than 2 portions a day of whole-grain food and/or enriched with dietary fibre, having a sedentary lifestyle (MET min/week < 700).",21198d45-1c30-4ec8-a7a6-a3b4054347de

3,methods6," Weight from subjects wearing light clothes was measured, after voiding, to the nearest 0.1 kg on a digital scale (Model 703; Seca). Height of subjects was recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm with a stadiometer (Model 213; Seca). Body composition, including total body water, fat mass and fat-free mass, was determined at an ambient temperature after voiding and after being in a supine position for at least 20 min, through an electric impedance analysis with a single-frequency 50-kHz bioelectrical impedance analyser (BIA 101 RJL; Akern Bioresearch) as described in Meslier and co-workers [9]. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight in kg divided by height in meters squared. According to the World Health Organisation (World Health Organisation (WHO)) task force and the National Institutes of Health (National Institutes of Health (NIH)) guidelines, people whose Body mass index (BMI) is between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2 are considered normal weight, between 25 and 29.",0be918ca-365e-48b1-8c23-a88a14faf519

All EDTA blood samples were kept chilled/on ice before processing. Plasma samples were prepared by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and within 15 min of collection. All biological samples were rapidly frozen and stored at − 80 °C until analysis. Plasma glucose, insulin and serum hs-CRP concentrations as well as HOMA index were assessed as described previously [9].  Extraction of ECs and NAEs from plasma samples  The analysis of ECs and NAEs was performed in EDTA plasma samples. All samples were thawed in the fridge at 4 °C before extraction and samples were kept chilled on ice during the specific extraction procedures. A solid-phase extraction (solid phase extraction (SPE)) according to the method described by Marczylo and colleagues was carried out [25].",e3fb8abe-87e9-450d-88fc-eb5fea9e6e8c

Faecal microbiome determination by shotgun metagenomics  A full description of the sampling, sequencing and data analysis procedures is reported in the online supplementary material by Meslier and colleagues [9]. Briefly, faecal DNA extraction was performed following IHMS SOP P7 V2 and purified DNA fragment libraries were sequenced using the Ion Proton Sequencer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, US) with a minimum of 20 million 150-bp high-quality reads generated per library. Metagenomic Species Pangenome (Metagenomic Species Pangenome (MSP)) abundance profiles were determined and annotated as previously described [9, 26] and the in-house FAnToMet pipeline was used to assess the functional potential modules of the intestinal gut microbiome.

Briefly, extracted DNA was quantified using Qubit Fluorometric Quantitation (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, US) and amplified using primers targeting the 16S rRNA for A. muciniphila (forward CAGCACGTGAAGGTGGGGAC and reverse CCTTGCGGTTGGCTTCAGAT). The total 16S rRNA gene was also quantified and used as reference gene in order to normalise the abundance of A. muciniphila in all samples tested (bacterial universal primers forward ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG and reverse ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG). Amplifications were performed using the StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies) with the following thermal cycling profiles: one cycle at 95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles at 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s and using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix Reagents Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Negative controls (H2O) were included in each qPCR run and each assay was performed in triplicate.",eb9c903d-3350-47cf-af3c-a6204d3e00bb
9,methods12," The results of the amplifications were expressed as threshold cycle (Ct) values. The relative quantification of A. muciniphila in all samples was calculated using the comparative Ct method (ΔCt, the difference between the Ct value of A. muciniphila and the Ct of total 16S rRNA gene for each sample). Lastly, the concentration of A. muciniphila was carried out by comparing ΔCt measures with a standard calibration curve (Y = − 3.527 × log10(X) + 17.677, R2 = 0.97, PCR efficiency = 92.11%) and by relating such values to total faecal DNA concentration.

10,analysis0," A power analysis using the mean plasma concentrations and variations of ECs and NAEs in previous studies was performed to estimate the sample size needed to detect an effect of diet on plasma concentrations of ECs and NAEs [19, 28]. We calculated that 39 participants per group was sufficient to detect a minimum inter-group difference of 23% and 13% in plasma concentrations of 2-AG and AEA, 10% and 14% in plasma concentrations of PEA and OEA as well as 10% and 9% in AEA/OEA and OEA/PEA ratios, respectively, with an α error of 0.05, 80% power and 2-sided testing. Therefore, 39 participants in CT and 43 in MD would be adequate to test the effect of MD on fasting circulating levels of ECs and NAEs.  All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.0. After being checked for normality, variables showing a significant positive skewness, were transformed in ln (x).",68ebe18a-bc0b-4fe8-92f8-3c44174c43d0
11,analysis1," For those variables that showed a normal distribution at the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Independent samples T test was performed to check differences between CT and MD at baseline. The 2-way ANOVA with repeated measure was performed to check within group differences over the study period. For those variables, which did not show a normal distribution after logarithmic transformation, a non-parametric Wilcoxon test was performed. To test the overall correlation among ECs, NAEs, microbiome and dietary variables, pairwise Spearman's rank correlations within CT and MD at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks were calculated and adjustments were performed using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure and Spearman rho values were filtered by keeping correlations with at least one false discovery rate (false discovery rate (FDR)) of ≤ 0.05.

25,discussion0," In this study, we showed that an isocaloric dietary shift from a Western diet to an MD lowered plasma AEA concentration and increased the OEA/PEA and OEA/AEA ratios. The increased total polyunsaturated fatty acid intake and decreased saturated fatty acid intake caused by increased consumption of fish products and nuts as isocaloric replacements of meat and dairy products might explain the changes in the circulating lipid mediators observed in MD participants [9, 31, 32]. No previous evidence of a food- or diet-induced change in the plasma OEA/PEA or OEA/AEA ratio is available. Interestingly, the OEA/PEA and OEA/AEA ratios are markers of blood cholesterol and insulin resistance [19], and their increase occurred concomitantly with the reduction in plasma cholesterol in our cohort [9].",3ac4e4d6-1a83-48de-b21f-d354f52e4aa4
26,discussion1,"  On the other hand, mounting evidence in obese subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)) indicates that circulating AEA is a mediator of the effects of obesity on gut barrier integrity, intestinal permeability and inflammation [33, 34] that underpin metabolic endotoxaemia [35]. Therefore, the reduction of AEA in the MD group suggests that MD may exert metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects through its action on intestinal permeability and endocannabinoid signalling.  This hypothesis was supported by the significant increase of A. muciniphila faecal abundance after 8 weeks of MD compared to CT. A. muciniphila was not among the microbial species found to change upon intervention in the subgroup of subjects previously analysed that excluded 20 participants because of a slight increase of fruit and vegetable consumption over the run-in period when compared with the consumption at the time of enrolment [9].  A.",dac6f5f3-0d4c-4aa3-b45b-0a0ad6dce504
27,discussion2," muciniphila is widely considered a valuable contributor to the maintenance of gut health and metabolic homoeostasis [36]. Indeed, A. muciniphila abundance decreases in several pathological conditions where intestinal dysbiosis, gut barrier functionality and endotoxaemia play key roles, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and hypertension [27, 37, 38]. Contrarily, A. muciniphila abundance increases following pharmacological treatments, bariatric surgery and prebiotic-based interventions that ameliorate multiple aspects of nutrient metabolism and gut barrier function [12, 27, 39, 40].  Therefore, we consider the increased abundance of A. muciniphila independently of body weight change as an indicator of the alleviation of obesity-related gut barrier dysfunction.",035deb25-da17-4a2e-ba85-854f3a064d1c
28,discussion3,"  In addition, circulating levels of AEA were negatively and OEA/PEA ratio was positively correlated with a number of other microorganisms associated with a healthy gut, such as Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, Bifidobacterium longum, Roseburia hominis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii [41–43], or known to metabolise ellagic acid and produce anti-inflammatory urolithins, such as Eggerthella [9]. Similar findings were recorded for the abundance of Prevotella sp. and P. copri, which show contradictory association with either health conditions or intestinal and metabolic diseases [44, 45], likely due to different genetic traits of the microrganisms according to strain diversity and dietary patterns [44, 46].  Altogether, these findings suggest that plasma AEA concentration may be a putative marker of altered gut permeability and dysbiosis, as already shown for intestinal AEA concentrations [15]. Contrarily, the OEA/PEA ratio may be an indicator of healthy gut barrier function.",aab422ea-d4c1-4238-a0b5-e2ee8f0b4956
29,discussion4," Indeed, participants falling in the quartile for the highest plasma levels of OEA/PEA (Q4) harboured in the gut higher abundances of fibre- or protein-degrading bacteria and species positively associated with a healthy gut barrier due to the production of short chain fatty acids, such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Roseburia [42, 47, 48]. Contrarily, participants with the lowest plasma concentrations of OEA/PEA (Q1), showed higher abundances of Blautia and Coprococcus taxa, C. ramosum and Alistipes previously associated with obesity, inflammation and animal-based diet rich in fat and proteins [49–51]. Therefore, Q4 participants, harbouring a healthy gut microbiota and displaying lower plasma AEA and higher plasma 2-AG concentrations, might possess a more functional intestinal barrier at baseline than Q1 participants. This was further supported by the differences found in functional and metabolic features of microbial communities between Q1 and Q4.",ddc33ac6-49d3-4203-8907-2f4d7fd4509a
30,discussion5," The more abundant glycocholate degradation module (MF0044) in Q4 might lower the intestinal concentration of glycocholic acid as occurring in healthy individuals vs those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [52]. Similarly, the glucose (MF0057) and lactose (MF0048) degradation modules might indicate a better ability to metabolise those nutrients whose transport modules, are increased in ileal Chron’s disease [53]. Interestingly, the participants in Q4 had also a lower intake of refined-grain products, oils, fats, snacks and meat than Q1 and, switching to an MD, ameliorated the inflammatory status. Although Q4 participants in the MD group consumed more whole-grain products and less meat than those in the CT group, their snacks intake decreased only after 4 weeks. This may explain why participants in Q4 experienced the greatest ant-inflammatory benefit from the MD after 4 weeks of intervention.",02cbee60-e04f-4d08-b8dc-cfe2a386602c
31,discussion6,"  The finding that Q1 participants at baseline consumed more refined-grain products, oils, fats, snacks and meat as compared to Q4 may suggest that the consumption of those foods has a role in shaping the functional and metabolic features of the gut microbiome in humans. Owing to the nature and duration of the study, these results should be interpreted cautiously as a preliminary indication of the effect of high sugar, high fat and high-energy-dense food consumption on the gut microbiome.  The macronutrient composition of the diets was not different between quartiles at baseline, suggesting that other food components in snacks, meat (including processed meat), refined-grain products, oils and fat might affect the endocannabinoid system and the gut microbiome. Evidence shows that food emulsifiers affect gut microbiota composition promoting colitis and metabolic syndrome in mice [54] while noncaloric artificial sweetener intake can cause intestinal dysbiosis in humans [55].",650896cf-7455-4290-912f-34bf28cbda75
32,discussion7,"  This study has three main strengths. First, the nutritional intervention applied allowed us to demonstrate an involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the interplay between MD consumption, the gut microbiome and health independently of changes in body weight and composition. Secondly, the influence of the baseline endocannabinoid tone in the physiological response to MD consumption provides new clinical indications for the nutritional management of subjects at risk of metabolic diseases within the framework of personalised nutrition. Thirdly, the intention-to-treat analysis of the gut microbiome data evidenced the effect of the MD in increasing the abundance of A. Muciniphila.",1632214d-f233-4947-b6bb-794ddd090c30
33,discussion8," This finding suggests that in the present study the overall aspects of MD, other than the increased intake in fruit and vegetables considered to select subjects in the per-protocol analysis in Meslier and co-workers [9], might contribute with the higher sample size in achieving the statistical differences between MD and CT as regards the diet-induced modulation of A. muciniphila.  On the other hand, since we did not measure gut permeability, we could not establish a causal role of gut barrier function/homeostasis in the interplay among the endocannabinoid system, the MD and health outcomes.  In conclusion, our study demonstrates that a switch from a Western-like diet to an isocaloric MD affects the endocannabinoid system and increases A. muciniphila abundance in the gut, independent of body weight changes in subjects with lifestyle risk factors for metabolic disease.",5bf37ecf-2566-4de9-b2c4-062ba168d4df
34,discussion9," Moreover, individual endocannabinoid tone at baseline drives a personalised response to the MD ameliorating insulin sensitivity or systemic inflammation. Specifically, individuals with a low-plasma OEA/PEA ratio (high AEA) exhibit an increase of plasma OEA/PEA and 2-AG, ameliorating insulin sensitivity, while those with a high-plasma OEA/PEA ratio (low AEA) show an increase in intestinal A. muciniphila and a reduction in systemic inflammation.  A high-plasma OEA/PEA ratio and low AEA concentration reflect a more functional gut microbiome characterised by species associated with gut homeostasis and barrier integrity. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that the individual endocannabinoid system is shaped by habitual intake of meat, refined-grain products, oils, fat and snacks affecting gut microbiome functionality and its responsiveness to dietary changes.",11375f22-cd19-473b-b767-b1c5d8aeda03
35,discussion10,"  Altogether our findings shed light on endocannabinoid system implication in the interplay between diet, gut and health, revealing opportunities for clinical practice in the context of personalised nutrition. Specifically, the data suggest that the measure of plasma OEA/PEA ratio and AEA concentration might mirror individual gut microbiome and intestinal barrier functionality determining the individual responsiveness towards metabolic and/or anti-inflammatory changes following a dietary intervention with an MD.
