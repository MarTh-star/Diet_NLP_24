The Mediterranean Diet (MD) is considered one of the healthiest dietary models. Randomized-controlled trials on the effect of MD in preventing pediatric allergic diseases are still needed.  Methods and analysis  The Mediterranean Diet during Pregnancy study (Pregnancy study (PREMEDI)) will be a 9-month multi-center, randomized-controlled, parallel groups, prospective trial. Healthy women (20–35 years) at their first trimester of pregnancy at risk for atopy baby, will be randomly allocated to Group 1 (standard obstetrical and gynecological follow-up and nutritional counseling to promote MD) or Group 2 (standard obstetrical and gynecological follow-up alone). 138 mother-child pair per group will be needed to detect a reduction in cumulative incidence of ≥1 allergic disease at 24 months of age.",201737b5-98ee-4b7c-9266-6e47ab4bf033

The secondary aims will be the evaluation of maternal weight gain, pregnancy/perinatal complications, growth indices and occurrence of other chronic disorders, mother-child pair adherence to MD and gut microbiome features, breastfeeding duration and breast milk composition, epigenetic modulation of genes involved in immune system, and metabolic pathways in the offspring.  Ethics and dissemination  The study protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Naples Federico II (number 283/21) and it will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration (Fortaleza revision, 2013), the Good Clinical Practice Standards (CPMP/ICH/135/95), the Italian Decree-Law 196/2003 regarding personal data and the European regulations on this subject.

Innovative strategies aimed at limiting the pediatric allergy burden are advocated, to reduce the socio-economic costs for the families and the healthcare systems (1). The first 1,000 days of life, from the conception to 24 months, are crucial to achieve long-term health outcomes and represent a strategic period to intervene under prevention and public health perspective (2).  Nutritional exposures during this critical period of life can influence the future disease susceptibility (3).",d16e2c78-abb2-4b98-b36f-6641f2bc558e
3,introduction3," Maternal diet during pregnancy has been linked to offspring allergy risk and it could represent a potential target for allergy prevention (1). The Mediterranean Diet (MD) is considered one of the healthiest dietary models, which impacts beneficially the gut microbiome (GM), providing high amounts of fiber, antioxidants polyphenols and vitamins, and a balanced ratio of essential fatty acids (ω6:ω3) (4). Notably, the MD beneficial effects are due to the synergistic and interactive combinations of nutrients, and the modulation of gene expression through epigenetic changes is one important mechanism by which MD can lead to regulatory effects in immune system (5). Advances in understanding diet-GM-epigenetics-immune system axis have highlighted the importance of GM-derived metabolites in maintaining health and immune homeostasis.",abaf43cb-7dc2-4db9-8728-5e33ab8a40f1
4,introduction4," Among the GM-derived metabolites, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have emerged as key signaling molecules driving beneficial downstream effects on immune pathways (6). MD is typified by a high-level of whole cereals, fruit, vegetables, and legumes, the main fermentation substrates for SCFAs microbial production (4). In addition, overall MD-derived components, like ω-3 long chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids derived from marine foodstuffs, mono-unsaturated oleic acid of olive oil (rich in antioxidants e.g., tocopherols), vitamins and trace elements, polyphenols and carotenoids including lycopene, are known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic capacities, indicating their potencies to improve allergy protection by combining these elements (7).  Although, several observational birth-cohort and retrospective studies have provided conflicting results on the effects of MD in pregnancy on allergy prevention in the offspring.",9fbad6a2-0fa6-4103-ba04-62b4be992b5f
5,introduction5," Eight studies have explored the effect of maternal MD during pregnancy on the incidence of allergic diseases in the offspring (8–15). Six of them were cohort studies (8–13), and two were cross sectional studies (14, 15). In the ALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) birth cohort study adherence to MD during pregnancy was not associated with a reduced risk of asthma or other allergic outcomes in the offspring but may be associated with increased small airway function in childhood (13). Similarly, a study involving 1,087 Spanish infants from the International Study of Wheezing in Infants (Estudio Internacional de Sibilancias en Lactantes, EISL) showed that the consumption of MD during pregnancy did not elicit protective effect for wheezing, recurrent wheezing, or eczema at 12 months of age in children (11).",137768ec-ca18-4d17-988d-ef6fd9320166
6,introduction6," Another Spanish observational study did not evidence any association between maternal adherence to the MD and development of wheezing, rhinitis, and dermatitis in the children at 4 years of age (15). Likewise, the results of a USA pre-birth cohort of 1,376 mother-infant pairs from Project Viva showed that MD during pregnancy was not associated with recurrent wheeze at 3 years of age (12). Furthermore, a high adherence to MD during pregnancy was not significantly associated with reduction of infantile wheeze or eczema in two mother-child cohorts in Spain and Greece (10). On the contrary, two Spanish studies reported that high adherence to MD during pregnancy elicited significant negative associations with wheeze and atopy in children (8, 9), and one study from Mexico reported that adherence to MD was inversely associated with asthma, wheezing, rhinitis, sneezing, current sneezing, and current itchy-watery eyes (14).",b677660e-046b-4ca3-8dbb-84a80beffbf0
7,introduction7," Lastly, a general low MD-adherence has been described during pregnancy (16). These data were confirmed by the results of a pilot study performed at our Center, where we observed a low adherence rate to MD in pregnant women at their first trimester of pregnancy (unpublished data).  Unfortunately, these studies have assessed maternal diet retrospectively. Thus, the lack of prospective randomized-controlled trials, exploring the effects of a specific nutritional counseling for MD promotion during pregnancy on allergy prevention in the offspring, is a major limitation for understanding the role of MD in pregnancy in preventing pediatric allergies. The Mediterranean Diet during Pregnancy study (Pregnancy study (PREMEDI)) was designed to address this limitation.",28e52120-d6b0-44dc-bd4a-be61dd254398
8,introduction8,"  Whilst previous studies provided conflicting results on the protective effect elicited by MD against pediatric allergies, it is unknown whether an intervention to promote the MD in pregnancy could reduce the likelihood of allergic diseases in the offspring. We hypothesize that a dietary intervention aiming to promote an optimal adherence to MD during pregnancy could be able to limit the occurrence of allergic diseases in early childhood, including atopic eczema, allergic oculorhinitis, allergic urticaria, asthma, and IgE and non-IgE mediated food allergies.  Methods and analysis  Study settings  The study will involve four tertiary gynecology and neonatology centers located in the Campania region in Italy.

We will perform intention to treat (ITT) analysis by considering the mother-child pair lost after randomization: (1) all missing values of the primary outcome will set to the worst outcome in both groups (equal-case scenario intention to treat (ITT)) and (2) missing values of the primary outcome will set to the worst outcome in the Group 1 and to the best outcome in the Group 2 (worst-case scenario intention to treat (ITT)). The worst outcome will be defined as the occurrence of ≥1 atopic condition at 24 months, in the offspring; the best outcome will be its opposite. The secondary outcomes will be evaluated using per-protocol analysis. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to determine whether variables are normally distributed. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline characteristics.",c20fb8b3-217b-4463-8d84-0c1932792b1b
35,analysis1," The Student t-test will be used to compare mean values of continuous variables for approximating a normal distribution. For non-normally distributed variables, the Mann-Whitney U test will be used. The χ2 test or Fisher exact test will be used, when appropriate. We will use a binomial regression model (binomial regression model (BRM)) to estimate the incidence of the main outcome, i.e., at least one atopic condition at 24 months, in the offspring. The response variable of the binomial regression model (BRM) will be the presence of at least one atopic condition at 24 months (0 = no; 1 = yes), and the predictor will be the treatment cohort (0 = Group 1; 1 = Group 2). To evaluate the effect of potential confounders on the main outcome, we will add each of them separately to the aforementioned binomial regression model (BRM) and we will evaluate the changes in the estimated risk ratios.",a71a512a-3e78-4360-9429-8b4415217a68
36,analysis2," The evaluated potential confounders will be sex (0 = female; 1 = male), age (months), cesarean delivery (0 = no; 1 = yes), born at term (0 = no; 1 = yes), breastfed for at least 2 months (0 = no; 1 = yes), weaning (months), siblings (number), exposed to passive smoking (0 = no; 1 = yes), mother smoked during pregnancy (0 = no; 1 = yes), and exposed to pets (0 = no; 1 = yes), drug use (0 = no; 1 = yes), antiseptics exposure (0 = no; 1 = yes), lifestyle (0 = rural; 1 = urban), dietary habits (0 = low MD-adherence; 1 = medium MD-adherence; 2 = high MD-adherence) and pollution exposure (0 = no; 1 = yes). binomial regression model (BRM) is among the most commonly suggested methods to report the results from randomized controlled trials with binary outcomes. Regression modeling allows adding baseline co-variables to increase the precision of the estimate and better control for potential confounders.",d2b984d6-01eb-455f-9616-e1b550d14bc6
37,analysis3," Comparisons of taxa or gene abundance between groups will be carried out using pairwise Wilcoxon tests. Statistical significance of pangene prevalence will be verified through Fisher’s test with multiple-hypothesis testing corrections via the false discovery rate (false discovery rate (FDR)). Machine learning-based classification analysis will be done using the MetAML package (30) and by considering random forests (RFs) as back-end classifier for all the results. Results will be obtained through a fivefold cross-validation and averaged on 20 independent runs. To evaluate whether the significant associations for the cord blood analysis primarily reflect maternal adherence to MD, additional models adjusted for cord blood DNA methylation of the same CpG site and for miRNAs will be evaluated when examining the association between DNA methylation/miRNAs and childhood allergic sensitization.",fc8be2fc-95a3-4e3b-8276-1e02b7ae7cb8
38,analysis4," For DNA methylation, using a reference methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL)) library, we will evaluate the genetic control of methylation for the top 30 associated CpG sites identified from the mid-childhood meta-analysis for atopic sensitization, environmental and food allergen sensitization. We leveraged genetic-epigenetic information from the ARIES large-scale genome-mQuantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis, which included 1,000 mother-child pairs2 (31). mQuantitative Trait Loci (QTL) comparisons will be focused on the cis position (i.e., a genetic variant within ±500 Kb of a methylation locus) measured from cord blood, and with MAF ≥5%. The level of significance for all statistical tests will be two-sided, p < 0.05. An integrative approach that combines multi-omics data together with integrated clinical data analysis will be performed.",2643e017-d26e-4aae-81a7-06d764c20a31
39,analysis5," Multivariable linear regression will be used to analyze associations differentially methylated regions in cord blood DNA with clinical measures of offspring. All significance values will be corrected to take into account the effect of multiple comparisons, using the Bonferroni adjustment. All analyses will be performed with Stata 16.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA), SAS® version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and R version 3.4.1.  Retention plan  The four tertiary centers involved in the Pregnancy study (PREMEDI) study will host gynecology, neonatology, and pediatrics facilities to perform on site the follow-up visits. Furthermore, the collaboration with family pediatricians (who in the Italian Health Care System provide primary care of patients from birth to 16 years), will facilitate an optimal adherence to all study phases.

40,discussion0," Allergic diseases are major chronic non-transmissible conditions for the Italian pediatric population.  Mediterranean Diet, during pregnancy and first 2 years of life, has been proposed as potential strategy to prevent several conditions in the pediatric age, including allergic diseases (32). Unfortunately, the lack of prospective randomized-controlled trials, exploring the effects of a specific nutritional counseling for MD promotion during pregnancy on allergy prevention in the offspring, is a major limitation for understanding the efficacy of MD in pregnancy in preventing pediatric allergies. The Pregnancy study (PREMEDI) study was designed to address this limitation.",c1c14ebf-459a-4fef-87be-cd74e0d6a242
41,discussion1,"  Strengths and limitations of this study:  – The Pregnancy study (PREMEDI) study is the first multi-center, randomized-controlled, prospective trial to evaluate the effect of a specific nutritional counseling for MD promotion in pregnancy on the onset of allergies in the offspring;  – The Pregnancy study (PREMEDI) study is inspired by solid preclinical and clinical evidence and involves a multidisciplinary team (composed by gynecologists, neonatologists, pediatricians, allergists, dietitians, pediatric nurses, microbiologists, biologists, biostatisticians) experienced in pediatric allergy;  – The reduction in cumulative incidence of allergic diseases in the pediatric population could have a positive impact on the socio-economic costs for the families and Healthcare System for the management of these conditions;  – The Pregnancy study (PREMEDI) trial has limited risks, given the lack of invasive procedures,",76ba3b8f-1036-42b2-b678-e6d072f2efc6
42,discussion2," and the expertise of RT;  – One possible pitfall of the study could derive from the fact that the trial will be conducted in a population with similar ethnicity and genetic background, demographic features, and environmental factors exposure. Thus, the results of the trial should be verified in populations with different features;  – Another possible limitation of the study may be the lack of evaluation of objective biomarkers of MD-adherence, such as plasma or urinary levels of selected nutrients.  Ethics and dissemination  The first version of the study protocol, the information sheet, the informed consent form, and the clinical chart have been reviewed and approved on October 11th, 2021, by the Ethical Committee of the University of Naples Federico II (protocol identification number 283/21).",5aeae3b6-f225-43ec-a41a-c8521b6e9e43
