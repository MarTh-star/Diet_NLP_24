0,background0,"Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, associated with metabolic and cardiovascular disease [1,2]. Psoriasis is estimated to affect about 2–4% of the population in Western countries [3]. A number of risk factors have been recognized in the etiology and pathogenesis of psoriasis, including family history and environmental risk factors, such as diet, obesity, smoking, stress, and alcohol consumption [4]. Moreover, dietary factors can also affect both drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. A number of single food components have been suggested to play a role in psoriasis. The ability of dietary of antioxidants, such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish oil, some vitamins (A, E and C), and oligoelements (iron, copper, manganese, zinc and selenium), which decrease oxidative stress and the production of reactive oxygen species, might be of particular relevance mainly in a chronic systemic inflammatory diseases, like psoriasis [5].",cf33f95e-df2a-4f62-8605-b3e4539ffce9
1,background1," In addition, due to its role in proliferation and maturation of keratinocytes, vitamin D has become an important therapeutic option in the treatment of psoriasis [6]. However, while many studies have evaluated the role of individual nutrients on the development of psoriatic disease [7], only few studies have investigated the effect of a healthful eating pattern. The psoriatic patients, in fact, often seek dietary advice, as they frequently link many of their health problems, including diseases of the skin, to their diet.  The Mediterranean diet is a healthy eating pattern, associated with reduced risk for metabolic [8], cardiovascular [9], and neoplastic diseases [10], that has consistently been shown to provide a degree of protection against chronic degenerative diseases [11].",c87f62d5-4245-4122-987b-777e37cc5f29
2,background2," One of the most accredited hypothesis of this association is that the high content of different beneficial compounds, such as antioxidants and polyphenols, largely present in Mediterranean foods, such as plant foods, fruits and red wine, have anti-inflammatory properties [12]. In particular, the monounsaturated fatty acids intake, whose major source is represented by extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)), was found to be associated with a reduced prevalence of risk factors for major chronic inflammatory diseases [13].  Obesity is an important risk factor for psoriasis [14]. The relationship between the two conditions is probably bidirectional, with obesity predisposing to psoriasis and psoriasis favoring obesity [15]. Several studies have been conducted to explore the association between obesity and psoriasis [16,17]. In particular, there was a 2-fold increased risk for psoriasis development in the setting of obesity as compared with normal weight subjects [18].",c1a104bf-ae38-4665-8dc0-192ff12dd423
3,background3," In addition, for each unit increment increase in body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was reported a 9% higher risk for psoriasis onset and a 7% higher risk for increased of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)) score [19], currently the preferred method for the assessment of the disease severity and extent. A further evidence of a link between, obesity, inflammation and cardiovascular diseases in patients with psoriasis is provided by several studies reporting a correlation between Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and increased of C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) levels [20], an acute phase protein significantly associated with obesity, representing the most sensitive markers of inflammation and an independent risk for cardiovascular disease.",8b94eb6f-8b22-4aef-a02e-9d99ca8f46e0
4,background4," body mass index (BMI) is a commonly used surrogate for adiposity that is inexpensive and easily measured, although it evaluates excess weight rather than excess fat [21], does not measure body fat directly and poorly distinguishes between fat mass and lean or bone mass [22]. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)) Clinical Guidelines recognize this limitation of body mass index (BMI) [23]; thus, waist circumference (WC) is recommended as an additional surrogate measure of fat distribution, due to its high correlation with visceral fat [24], the main source of inflammatory cytokines in obesity [25]. Again, a number of studies have evidenced a strict association between WC and psoriasis [26], being the production of inflammatory cytokines in visceral obesity the link involved in the complex mechanisms leading to the exacerbation of psoriasis [27].",c8aba8f4-af11-4ff8-8acd-b1086ae8a2ca
5,background5," Nevertheless, only few studies have assessed body composition in psoriatic patients [28,29]. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)) is a simple, safe, inexpensive and non-invasive method to estimate body composition. This method is particularly useful in determining body compartments in studies of large population samples [30].  The wake of this evidence, we aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet using a 14-item PREDIMED (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) questionnaire [31], the body composition by Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and the severity of psoriasis evaluated by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and C reactive protein (CRP) levels in a group of naïve-treatment patients with psoriasis.

Data collected included age, gender, weight, height, body mass index (BMI) and WC. Severity of psoriasis and the age at onset of it (early psoriasis: age < 39 years and late psoriasis aged >40 years) were also noted. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score was used as measure of disease severity. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score was used to be recorded by measuring four body surface areas (head, chest, upper and lower limbs) with patient in a standing position according to the method described by Harari M et al. 2000 [32].",b2e0b36d-3bbf-4672-b5f4-ff6b4a50edcc

Exclusion criteria for controls were the same as the patients. Blood samples were obtained between 08.00 h and 09.00 h from an antecubital vein after an overnight fast, with the patient in the resting position. C reactive protein (CRP) levels was determined with a nephelometric assay with CardioPhase high-sensitivity from Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics (Marburg, Germany); the intra-assay coefficient of variations was >4%.  All anthropometric measurements were taken with subjects wearing only light clothes and without shoes. In each subject, weight and height were measured to calculate the body mass index (BMI) [weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2), kg/m2].",2156f9d4-5189-44d0-87e5-d638d32354ac

All participants were supine with limbs slightly spread apart from the body, refrained from eating, drinking, and exercising for six hours before testing. Subjects were tested in the supine position with arms and legs abducted from the body. Shoes and socks were removed and contact areas were scrubbed with alcohol immediately before electrode placement.

A validated 14-item questionnaire for the assessment of adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) [31] was recorded for all the enrolled subjects during a face-to-face interview between the patient and a certified nutritionist. Briefly, for each items was assigned score 1 and 0; PREDIMED score was calculated as follows: 0–5, lowest adherence; score 6–9, average adherence; score ≥10, highest adherence [31].

20,discussion0,"Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease. Beyond the skin, psoriasis is associated with a systemic inflammatory state that has been linked to obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes. The causes of psoriasis are not fully understood, but a number of risk factors are recognized, including family history and environmental risk factors, such as diet, smoking, stress, obesity, and alcohol consumption [34].  The novel finding of this study is the association between the severity of psoriasis, assessed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and C reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet. In particular, the results of our study show that a higher percentage of psoriatic patients have a low adherence to the Mediterranean diet compared with the age- sex- and body mass index (BMI)-matched control group.",ae732e44-8c77-4003-adcf-d0370459d1dc
21,discussion1," In line with the current literature, we found that body mass index (BMI) and abdominal obesity, as measured by WC, were associated with psoriasis [26]. In addition, as also very recently reported [35] in a series of psoriatic patients (treated and untreated) compared with normal weight controls, we found that psoriatic patients exhibited statistically significant differences in body composition evaluated by Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) also compared with body mass index (BMI)-matched control group. In particular, we found that psoriatic patients have lower values of the ratio of TBW to body weight, greater amounts of adiposity and lower muscle mass compared with the obese counterpart without psoriasis.",e71a1e08-4623-4e9b-b6d3-06148412504e

These findings might suggest the presence of a form of sarcopenic obesity in psoriatic patients, likely linked to their chronic inflammatory disease, and let us also to hypothesize a worsening effect of psoriasis on body composition among equally obese individuals. Furthermore, after including all Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameters as predictive variables in the multiple regression model, FM remained the major predictor of the severity of the psoriasis.",02aa74fc-8113-4168-84d6-a2605fdbfc88
23,discussion3," Thus, the usefulness of a careful assessment of body composition in the evaluation of the psoriatic patients of both genders is conceivable suggested.  Single food components have been suggested to play a role in aetiology and pathogenesis of psoriasis. Previous studies of the relationship of diet and nutrition with psoriasis have focused on either individual nutrients (eg, fish oil, omega 3, vitamin B12, vitamin D, vitamin A, selenium, inositol and zinc and antioxidants) or individual food groups (eg, fruit, vegetables, and fish) [5]. However, diet is a complex combination of foods from various groups and nutrients, and some nutrients are highly correlated. Thus, it is challenging to separate the effect of a single nutrient or food group from that of others in free-living populations [38].  One of the most frequently asked questions by patients with psoriasis is whether dietary changes could improve their disease.",01162532-0327-46a2-b3aa-e06227be9af4
24,discussion4," Given the negative impact of psoriasis on quality of life, patients often seek information about dietary and lifestyle modifications to assist in clearing their skin lesions [18]. Modifying diet is an accessible and self-empowering method that many patients are eager to embrace in treating their disease. However, despite the fact that nutrition might be considered an adjunctive tool for the treatment of psoriasis, there are no national or international guidelines that recommend an adequate diet for such patients [39]. With increasing awareness that psoriasis is associated with cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, patients may also seek to improve diet to prevent these comorbidities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to look at the association between adherence Mediterranean diet and psoriasis. In particular, the psoriatic patients consumed less extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), fruit, fish and nuts, while consumed more red meat compared to the control group.",5d117081-d014-49b3-8680-94d14a584c45

The most interesting aspect of this study is that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is appraised using only a brief 14-item questionnaire (PREDIMED questionnaire) [31] which is less time-demanding, less expensive and requires less collaboration from participants than the usual full-length food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) or other more comprehensive methods [12].

26,discussion6," In fact, this 14-item tool is a key element in the intervention conducted in the PREDIMED trial and has been previously validated against the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used in the study [42]. In addition, we reported the specific association of each of the 14 individual items included in the PREDIMED score with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and C reactive protein (CRP) levels. In particular, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and C reactive protein (CRP) levels were both negatively correlated not only with the PREDIMED score, but also the consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), vegetables, fruit, legumes, fish and nuts, and positively correlated with the consumption of red meat.

27,discussion7," extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is one of many components of the Mediterranean diet. The decarboxy methyl ligstroside aglycone (also known as oleocanthal), a phenolic compound contained in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), has been reported to provide per se both sensory and anti-inflammatory attributes of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), thus contributing to the health benefits associated with the Mediterranean dietary pattern [43]. Oleocanthal is homologous with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen [44] for both perceptual and anti-inflammatory properties.",8f8ac912-4cb9-435e-9318-3ed7701f3b88
28,discussion8," Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that long term consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) containing this compound may contribute to significantly reduce the development and/or the progression of chronic inflammatory diseases and to increase the response to biological agents, thus representing a nutritional marker of responsiveness to Tumor Necrosis Factor-α blockers in psoriasis, in association with genetic marker, such as Interleukin 6 gene promoter polymorphism [45]. In this context, we evaluated also the relationship between the C reactive protein (CRP) levels, produced by the liver under the influence of IL-6 as one of the links between the altered cytokine milieu and psoriasis, and the consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Indeed, we found higher consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and lower C reactive protein (CRP) levels in the control group compared with psoriatic patients.",c7438122-c400-421f-b18c-acaa6067ba10
29,discussion9,"  Conclusions This is the first study to evaluate the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the severity of psoriasis, with a strict relationship between a higher consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and a lower psoriasis severity. Although we are aware that the reduced sample size and the validity of Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in predicting the FM might be a limitation of our study, the association between the Mediterranean Diet and psoriasis severity suggests the possible beneficial effects of nutritional interventions promoting a Mediterranean food pattern rich in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), fruits, vegetables, fish, chicken and whole grains, as an inexpensive and safe adjuvant treatment for psoriatic patients. Moreover, our study highlights the usefulness of the assessment of body composition by Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in the evaluation of the psoriatic patients.",fa163cf8-4805-43e8-be4c-59620a70767c
