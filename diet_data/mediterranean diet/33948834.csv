The Su Eatable LIFE (SEL) database14 was created using a standardised methodology to extract information from published CF studies and to assign CF values and uncertainties to food items15. The database contains 3349 CF values (with Eurocentric prevalence of 50–60%), extrapolated from 841 publications (1998–2019) and distributed in four main commodity groups: fresh or minimally processed (frozen, canned or dried) plant-based food commodities (978 CF data), plant-based industrially processed food (457 CF data), fresh or processed food commodities derived from terrestrial animals (1496 CF data) and food commodities from the ocean and freshwaters (263 CF data).",17abed88-ab86-43ee-bbc8-0d6f1cfe3d52
1,methods1," Data from single studies, once harmonized to refer to the same system boundaries and functional unit, are further aggregated to represent the food items commonly found in the market definitions (apple, yogurt, potato, etc.). Each food item is categorised by typologies (a group of items with similar characteristics) and within some typology category, by sub-typologies (e.g. the typology “shellfish” includes the following sub-typologies: crustacean, bivalves and cephalopods). The CF database comprises a total of 85 food typologies, 11 food sub-typologies and 323 food items14,15. A robust methodology of uncertainty attribution, based on three statistic indicators, is applied to define the statistically representative CF value of each food commodity (details of the statistical approach are fully explained in Petersson et al.15).",404d6a62-0ad8-48ca-b37b-ed4d40349a91

The reference documents report the minimum–maximum limits of food group consumption frequency over a week but do not specifically recommend serving size10,19, as the exact make-up of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet will vary depending on individual characteristics (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle and degree of physical activity), cultural context, locally available foods and dietary customs20. To define the impacts of a reference MD dietary plan, three different weekly dietary scenarios (Table 1) were created where the daily intake of plant-based food groups (cereals, vegetables, fruit, etc.",d4e6e2e4-8a5b-4a6a-a213-4f7d5422b883

10,methods11,"  Next, food items used for the estimates of consumption data, were aggregated into 15 food groups (Table 1), based on MD Pyramid guidelines10,25 and a CF value (functional unit kg CO2eq. kg−1 or l−1 food) was assigned to each food group in each dietary scenario (Table 1). For this specific task, the CF value attributed to each food group was estimated as a weighted CF value (weighted CFFG) using the CF values extracted from the Su Eatable LIFE (SEL) database14. This approach avoids wrongly attributing equal environmental “weight” to items that only have a moderate level of consumption by EU citizens within a food group. The following Eq. (3) was used:3 WeightedCFFG=∑1nCFi×freq.i  where CFi is the CF value of the i-th food item of the food group FG (including n items); freq.i is the relative frequency of consumption of the i-th food item in the food group FG (food groups are reported in Table 1).",d023cf65-30fd-46f9-8ed1-1e34b8d3a1ef

For the specific case of the weighted CFFG of the food group “cheese”, two items were considered separately, fresh cheese and semi-hard/hard cheese, due to their different caloric value and nutrient density and different CFs14,15 (Table 1).  To estimate the total emissions (EGHG) associated with each of the three scenarios of the MD (Table 1), the total weekly intake (g) of each food group was multiplied by its corresponding weighted CFFG; the total weekly emissions of each food group were then summed and then divided by 7 (days in a week) to express the result as average per capita daily emissions.",0e28a86b-57fe-4cf6-b3d2-4afa27460d92

13,methods14,"  For this specific analysis, to compare the dietary intake to the correct food consumption term “bone free meat”, the average bone free meat consumption of Mediterranean citizens was estimated using the FAOSTAT element “protein supply quantity” (code 674) (g protein per capita d−1). Equation 5 was used to estimate the average per capita daily consumption of bone free meat (consumption of bone free meat (CBFM)) (g capita−1 d−1) in 7MED for each meat type (beef, mutton, pork and poultry), to avoid biases due to disproportional population size and meat consumption among the studied countries.5 consumption of bone free meat (CBFM)=∑1nITEMPiPrtfrac×Populationi/∑1nPopulationi  where n represents the 7MED countries, ITEMPi is the daily protein supply quantity for the specific meat type P in country i; Prtfrac is the fraction of protein content of the meat, calculated considering different meat cuts23, with Prtfrac values of 0.21 for beef meat (anterior and posterior cuts), 0.21 for mutton, 0.",65cdf43f-7067-4ba8-9af0-e7901bb6b8ee

The weekly consumption was estimated as consumption of bone free meat (CBFM) multiplied by 7 (days in a week).  The weekly food deviation of the 7MED from the ideal MD pattern was calculated for each of the 15 food groups as the difference between the amount of weekly food intake proposed by the MD (average value of the 3 scenarios of Table 1) and the calculated weekly consumption data (with 2017 as the reference year). The weekly deviation expressed in grams was multiplied by the weighted CF factors of each food group to derive total CO2eq emissions (Supplementary Table 4). The total CO2eq daily net excess was estimated by summing the CO2eq weekly deviations of the 15 groups divided by 7 (days in a week).",d1a3e0e4-13c7-40ef-b297-22660e408f51
15,methods16," For the meat category, the excess of each meat type (beef, mutton, pork and poultry) was calculated separately and multiplied by the respective CF value, and then the emissions were summed again to represent red meat (beef, mutton and pork) and poultry separately.  Kcal deviation per week (Supplementary Table 4) per food group was also derived by multiplying the weekly deviation in grams of the food group by its weighted kcal value. The latter was calculated from the kcal values of the single food items belonging to the group, with a similar approach to Eq. 3.  Annual per capita emissions (EGHG) from meat consumption of EU citizens between 1961 and 2017  The emissions (EGHG) associated with apparent meat consumption in the EU from 1961 to 2017 was estimated based on the element “food” (code 5142) in the FAOSTAT food balance database.",49e2ec40-0932-4cc0-811f-32fb4f0af025
16,methods17," To analyse the meat consumption in the 28 countries investigated in this study for a timeframe when EU 28 was not existing yet, we listed the countries present in the EU 28 in 2017 and then we analysed the trend of each country from 1961. Due to different political assets, Czechoslovakia data was considered from 1961 to 1992, and Belgium-Luxembourg data from 1961 to 1999. Croatia data is missing before 1991, which might have resulted in some bias between the data of meat consumption in 7MED before and after 1991. However, the estimate of emissions from meat consumption represents a weighted average and not the sum of total emissions, which means that any error would be considered only minor. To estimate the CO2eq emissions for each meat type, we used an average CF value based on bone free meat and meat with bone CF data14,15.",3fb7f937-9e3c-434c-9b7b-21760f7c91d0
17,methods18,"  Results and discussion  To meet the 2050 global emission reduction target, the EAT-Lancet Commission has proposed a planetary health dietary pattern formulated to represent a boundary of 5 Gt of CO2eq per year (uncertainty range of 4.7–5.4 Gt CO2eq yr−1) from food production, about half of the total GHG emissions (CO2eq) expected in 2050 with the RCP2.6 scenario (2 °C temperature rise)2. The CFs values used in this study to estimate the MD emissions (EGHG) were applied to the recommended average weekly per capita food consumption rates reported by Willet et al.2, obtaining a value of 2.49 kg CO2eq capita−1 d−1, which we used as a reference value to assess the climate sustainability of the MD. We then assessed that adherence of an average citizen to the MD pattern, as reported in Table 1, would lead to a daily per capita emissions (EGHG) of 2.31 ± 0.14 kg CO2eq capita−1 d−1.",6fe112fd-c139-4dc3-ac7d-5902e8ebf22c
18,methods19," This value is in agreement with the estimated emissions (EGHG) impact of the EAT-Lancet dietary recommendations2, corroborating the important role that the MD could play in contributing to the EU emissions (EGHG) mitigation targets.  In contrast, our analysis of actual food consumption patterns in 7MED shows that Mediterranean citizens were far from this ideal dietary target emitting, on average, about 4.46 kg CO2eq capita−1 d−1, which is almost double the expected daily emissions (EGHG) from the ideal MD pattern. Moreover, average daily emissions (EGHG) in 7MED was comparable to that of the other EU citizens (21OTHER), which is 4.03 kg CO2eq capita−1 d−1 (Fig. 1). An in-depth analysis of emissions (EGHG) associated with the dietary consumption patterns of the two groups (Fig. 1) shows that there are no major differences in terms of the highest-emitting food: beef meat, mutton meat and cheese2,14.",cbef3829-dbaa-41c3-b5b7-176bf9496bd7
19,methods20," While emissions (EGHG) from poultry consumption were comparable, the 7MED countries showed higher emissions (EGHG) from pork and fish consumption. emissions (EGHG) from added fat sources were comparable, as 21OTHER citizens consumed slightly more than twice the amount of butter (CF 8.48 kg CO2eq kg−1) used in Mediterranean countries, while 7MED citizens consumed 8 times more olive oil (CF of 3.26 kg CO2eq kg−1), which levelled off the difference. Both groups had a comparable use of seed oil. + 7MED citizens tended to consume more plant-based food, which is one of the three pillars of the MD19. Notably, the difference in emissions (EGHG) between the two groups was relatively small (Fig. 1), as the CF magnitude of plant-based food is significantly lower than that of animal-based food2,14,15,26.Figure 1 Annual per capita emissions (EGHG) (kg CO2eq. capita−1 yr−1) associated with food consumption of EU citizens.",ff4c2fa9-0cb3-40f5-b1cb-a5e1d2094371
20,methods21," emissions (EGHG) of food groups refer to the weighted mean food consumption of Mediterranean citizen (7MED, grey bars) and other EU countries (21OTHER, black bars) in 2017.  To better comprehend the current patterns of food consumption and related GHG impacts in Mediterranean countries, we compared the ideal weekly MD plan with the real weekly food consumption pattern of Mediterranean EU citizens. Our results show a clear deviation of real dietary habits from the ideal MD pattern. The per capita dietary intake exceeded the energy and nutrient requirements of the reference MD diet, which was largely the result of increased intake of meat, mostly red meat, cheese, additional fats and carbohydrate-rich food (Fig. 2a, c). Food and calorie excess not only have major consequences on healthy perspective2,9 but also result in a considerable daily excess of emissions (EGHG), equal to 1.8 kg of CO2eq capita−1 d−1 (Fig. 2b).",e8521b94-e570-46b2-aba7-e581f6868286
21,methods22," Whereas carbohydrate-rich food and additional fats significantly contributed to the calorie excess (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Table 4, 2 daily extra portions of grains, 1 extra portion of potatoes, 27 of sugars equivalents, 5 daily extra portions of oil and 37 extra grams of butter per week), the biggest contribution to the emissions (EGHG) excess came from over consumption of animal proteins (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 4, 2 portions of beef meat, 5 of pig meat, 1½ of poultry meat, 2 of cheese per week). Overall, the animal protein excess was 70% of the estimated total emissions (EGHG) excess of 1.8 kg of CO2eq capita−1 d−1, with red meat alone representing 56%. A low intake of red meat has been associated with traditional Mediterranean diets and is considered one of the main reasons for Mediterranean people’s longevity. A low incidence of coronary heart disease and mortality was identified in the island of Crete, Greece, in the 1960s.",f02acb35-5dc0-4028-a3a2-ff484e007cbb
22,methods23," This was associated27 with an average intake of red meat and poultry that combined was only 35 g capita-1 d-1. We calculated that, in Mediterranean countries in the 1960s, the total apparent meat consumption (FAOSTAT definition which includes meat with bone for some categories of cuts and animals), was around 25 kg capita-1 yr−1, corresponding to 68 g capita−1 d−1, which is in agreement with the daily intake of edible meat cut estimated in Crete by Kromhout et al.27. In 2017 the total apparent meat consumption of Mediterranean citizens had reached 86 kg capita−1 yr−1 (around 235 g capita−1 d−1), more than three times the meat consumption estimated in 1960 (Supplementary Fig. 1). This increase has coincided with a dramatic increase in emissions (EGHG) (Fig. 3).",4eb61082-52ad-4730-8ff7-1028726b1cdb
23,methods24," In the early 1990s, per capita emissions (EGHG) from meat consumption in Mediterranean countries were already above the emissions (EGHG) values estimated for the other EU countries, and only recently have the two groups started to converge, largely as a result of reduced beef consumption (Supplementary Fig. 1, Fig. 4).Figure 2 Deviations of food consumption patterns of Mediterranean citizens (7MED) from the reference MD.

25,methods26," While this allowed a direct comparison with the MD, which is traditionally based on fresh and locally produced food 11 and excludes many common beverages, it might introduce some underestimation of the total food-related emissions (EGHG) of EU citizens. In this respect, adherence to MD diet would be even more beneficial to climate targets than estimated, as fresh local and traditional food forms the base of Mediterranean food preparation. With an excess of 1.8 kg CO2eq capita−1 d−1 applied to the population of the 7MED countries, the potential total savings from adhering to MD recommendations would be approximately 105 Mt CO2eq y−1.  Conclusions  The results of this study support the positive role that the MD could have on EU climate mitigation targets if it were fully adopted by Mediterranean citizens. The analysis also shows that the nutritional transition experienced by Mediterranean countries, in particular over the last 30 years, has undermined this potential.",c0a5d21c-b314-4fed-b9ca-99b1e4463932
