We focused on literature published in the past 15 years by limiting the studies to only include those published between 1 January 2004 to 18 July 2019 (time of search). Relevant studies were identified using the following keywords and keyword combinations: “air pollution and health effects”, “health effects of air pollution”, “oxidative stress”, “oxidative stress and air pollution”, “antioxidants and air pollution”, “dietary intake and air pollution”, “Mediterranean diet and air pollution”, “dietary supplements and air pollution”, “dietary interventions and air pollution”, “antioxidant diet and air pollution”, “nutrition and air pollution”, “antioxidant polyunsaturated fatty acids”, “oxidative stress and antioxidant diet and air pollution”, “oxidative stress and antioxidant supplement and air pollution”, and “oxidative stress and antioxidant and air pollution”.",2be9784b-701d-43db-ac51-d21e89938b9c
1,methods1," Studies were exported to Mendeley reference manager software and any duplicates were removed. We also identified relevant reviews by expert knowledge.  It is worth noting that animal studies, which may have provided more evidence on antioxidants and underlying mechanisms, were excluded from this review. We decided to focus on research in human subjects due to time and resources limitations, but also because mechanistic evidence has been reviewed elsewhere [50,51], and is beyond our primary expertise.  We selected studies that met all the following criteria: Were published peer-reviewed journal articles offering insight to the relationship between antioxidant-rich diet or antioxidant supplement interventions and the adverse health effects of Traffic related air pollution (TRAP), or markers thereof.

Other important and necessary information was extracted from articles’ supplementary materials. Data extraction was done manually by J.B. and independently checked by two other authors (50% by K.S. and 100% by H.K.). A narrative synthesis was conducted in order to summarize and discuss the findings of the included studies.  3. Results 3.1. Overview of Results The literature search yielded 11 studies that fit the inclusion criteria (Table 1). Three were cohort studies and 8 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Sample sizes in the cohort studies ranged from 208 to 548,845 subjects.",d6289a53-75ef-47d3-a38e-a965990705ab
4,methods4," Various age groups were studied: 1 of the cohort studies examined adults age 50 to 71 years old, another examined asthmatic children between the ages of 6 and 14 and the third cohort study examined infants who were between 11 and 23 months. Sample sizes in the RCTs ranged from 29 to 267 subjects. One investigated asthmatic children between the ages of 7 and 11 years old, 5 RCTs examined healthy adults over the age of 18, whereas two used a more elderly population (50 to 72 years or over 60 years). Of the 11 studies that fit the inclusion criteria, 3 cohort studies examined participants’ dietary patterns through a self-answered dietary assessment to score their fruit and vegetable intake or their Mediterranean diet adherence and 5 of the 11 studies examined the use of fish oil supplementation. Two of these 5 compared fish oil supplementation to olive oil supplementation. Fish oil is known to contain antioxidants and has beneficial action on several antioxidant/inflammatory pathways.",a7c512ac-4781-4275-9a55-88808e513885
5,methods5," Olive oil was used as a partial-control for fish oil, however, it should be noted that it contains oleic acid, which is a key component of the Mediterranean diet that possesses a degree of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Two of the 11 studies examined the use of sulforaphane through a broccoli sprout beverage. Finally, 1 study examined the use of a combined supplement of vitamin E and vitamin C. The included studies looked at the following air pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, concentrated ambient PM (concentrated ambient PM (CAP)), NO2, O3, diesel exhaust particles (diesel exhaust particles (DEP)) and benzene (Table 1). Of the 11 studies that fit the inclusion criteria, 4 were conducted in the United States, 4 in Mexico, 2 in China and 1 in Spain. Three studies addressed antioxidant-rich diets while 8 studies addressed antioxidant supplementation.",1fca7c1b-519e-49b5-b10f-1740c49801b1
6,methods6," In the following sections, we describe the evidence from the 11 included studies under key categories of antioxidant-rich diets and antioxidant supplementations.  3.2. Fruit and Vegetable Rich Diet Fruits and vegetables are well known for being rich in nutrients and antioxidants. In a 2012 birth cohort study, Guxens et al. [52] analyzed the effects of antioxidants on infant mental development and its relationship to prenatal exposure to NO2 and benzene. Prenatal exposure to air pollution was assessed by passive samplers distributed over the study areas and land use regression models were developed based on these measurements to predict average outdoor air pollution levels for the entire pregnancy at each residential address. Mothers used a self-reported food frequency questionnaire (focused on fruit and vegetable intake) during their first trimester and whether the infant was breastfed through the second year of life.",6376ce55-d6c7-4981-9829-853e943c3a3f
7,methods7," A single maternal fasting blood specimen was drawn during pregnancy (mean ± SD, 13.4 ± 1.7 weeks of gestation) and maternal plasma vitamin D levels were determined. Mental development in infants between 11 and 23 months was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development is composed of 163 items that assess age-appropriate mental development, performance abilities, memory, and early language skills. The results demonstrated an inverse association between both NO2 and benzene exposure with mental development. The inverse association between pollutants and mental development was also found in infants who were not breastfed. Neither of these results were statistically significant. However, the study did result in a statistically significant inverse relationship between pollutants and mental development among infants with low maternal intake of fruits and vegetables.",7f545121-0b7b-4e0a-b646-d5ea6ff8f23d
8,methods8," This study suggested that the antioxidants consumed from fruits and vegetables may inhibit the cognitive impairments in infants that might have resulted from maternal exposure to air pollutants, especially in mothers who have a low antioxidant intake.  3.3. Mediterranean Diet The Mediterranean diet is rich in antioxidants because it is rich in plant-based foods, such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and olive oil [62]. It also includes low consumption of meat, moderate alcohol consumption (generally in the form of wine) and fish [63]. This diet is associated with improved cardiovascular health, reduced inflammation and reduced oxidative stress responses [64]. A large cohort study conducted in the United States had 548,845 adults between the ages of 50 and 71 used a self-reported dietary questionnaire to formulate an alternative Mediterranean diet (aMED) score based on their dietary patterns [46]. Participants who reported greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet (i.e.",ec44c8f2-172e-4a7b-9630-50719cbfbbb0
9,methods9,", had a high aMED score) had significantly lower rates of cardiovascular disease mortality associated with long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2.5, where long term exposure to air pollutants was determined as annual average concentration levels from 1994 to 2010. This supported the idea that greater adherence to the antioxidant-rich Mediterranean diet may blunt the adverse cardiovascular effects from air pollution exposure. Similarly, a dynamic panel cohort study of 208 children in Mexico City analyzed the relationship between fruit and vegetable intake (fruit and vegetable intake (FVI)) and Mediterranean diet index (Mediterranean diet index (MDI)) with lung function and airway inflammation. Readings from the closest fixed site monitoring station were assigned to the child’s residential address and used to estimate their exposure to PM2.5, NO2, and O3.",be09a89d-60b1-4269-850c-0212ae800cf4
10,methods10," Children were followed for 22 weeks, with their pulmonary function measured every 2 weeks, and their nasal lavage was collected and analyzed for inflammatory markers. Asthmatic children with a higher fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) scores had statistically significant lower interleukin-8 (a mediator of inflammation, IL-8) in their lavage after exposure to PM2.5, NO2, and O3. Children who had high fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) scores had 8% lower IL-8 than children with low fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) scores. Furthermore, asthmatic children who had higher Mediterranean diet index (MDI) scores had significantly higher lung function after exposure to PM2.5, NO2, and O3 [53]. Children with the highest Mediterranean diet index (MDI) scores had a 15.3% higher forced expiratory volume in one second and 16.",9da91ba9-7a0f-43ea-afaa-8279123bc255
11,methods11,"5% higher forced vital capacity than children with lower Mediterranean diet index (MDI) scores, which indicates increased lung functioning in those with higher Mediterranean diet index (MDI) scores [53]. However, no statistically significant protection from inflammation and reductions in lung function were found in the non-asthmatic children.  3.4. Fish Oil and Other Oil Supplements Fish oil and (to a lesser extent) soy oil have anti-inflammatory effects and have been shown to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitigate the oxidative stress response from stimuli, including air pollution [65]. In a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial, the effects of fish oil were compared to the effects of soy oil in 50 nursing home residents (all >60 years old) who had been exposed to elevated levels of PM2.5 from the ambient air. The participants spent 93% of their time indoors, and the mean levels of ambient PM2.5 in the room where the study was conducted was 18.",39f1f6e4-d1f7-447c-aad8-235c3e97ffd9
12,methods12,"6 µg/m3 (24 h average). This study was in Mexico City, where the major source of PM2.5 pollution is vehicular traffic and a large proportion of vehicles use diesel fuel. The mean levels of ambient PM2.5 outdoors during the study period was 19.6 µg/m3 (24 h average). Participants were given either 2 g of soy oil per day (control) or 2 g of fish oil per day with a 6-month monitoring period (1-month pre-supplementation and 5 months supplementation). In the pre-supplementation phase, the group receiving fish oil supplements experienced a 54% reduction in parameters of heart rate variability (heart rate variability (HRV)); high frequency log10-transformed heart rate variability (HRV) associated with a 1 standard deviation change in PM2.5 exposure. During the supplementation phase, this reduction was 7%.",36e9e9db-d8b4-4150-a972-6b8f1544d097
13,methods13," Participants who were given 2 g of fish oil supplements per day experienced a statistically significant reduction in their heart rate variability (heart rate variability (HRV)) decline after being exposed to PM2.5. On the other hand, participants who were given soy oil supplements experienced marginal and non-significant changes in heart rate variability (HRV) after PM2.5 exposure [54]. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) has been associated with increased mortality from sudden death and ventricular arrhythmia in both healthy and diseased individuals [57], thus the fish oil supplement suggest a beneficial effect whereas the soy oil did not.  In another RCT conducted by the same authors [55], 52 participants from a nursing home were given similar supplements of fish oil or soy oil for 4 months. Participants spent 93% of their time indoors where they were chronically exposed to ambient PM2.5 with a mean daily concentration of 38.7 µg/m3.",edac5cd4-6fc8-4c38-8ecd-cc214a3e4298
14,methods14," Both fish oil and soy oil groups increased plasma levels of superoxide dismutase (superoxide dismutase (SOD)) activity and increases in levels of reduced glutathione (glutathione (GSH)) demonstrating systemic efficacy of the antioxidant supplements (both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) are key antioxidant mediators). Additionally, the fish oil, but not the soy oil, group showed decreases in levels of lipoperoxidation (lipoperoxidation (LPO)), a marker of oxidative stress. A similar randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in China analyzed the extent to which fish oil supplements (2.5 g per day) would protect against cardiovascular damage as a result of PM2.5 exposures. The participants were 65 healthy, college students (20 to 25 years old) who underwent a 5-month supplementation phase with 4 rounds of follow up visits with an interval of 2 weeks in the last 2 months of the intervention. In this study, the placebo group was given sunflower seed oil.",6ea31003-6b16-449d-b5ec-015071cfa1de
15,methods15," There was greater levels of oxidative stress (higher levels of ox-LDL and lower activities of antioxidant capacity), inflammation and coagulation biomarkers, as well as endothelial dysfunction (higher levels of endothelin-1 and E-selectin, and lower levels of concentration of serum eNOS protein), and neuroendocrine disturbance in the placebo group compared to the fish oil supplement group [56].  Another RCT conducted in the United States found that healthy individuals (20 participants aged 50 to 72) given fish oil supplements (3 g per day) for 4 weeks prior to sequential 2 h chamber exposures to concentrated ambient PM (CAP) and ultrafine particulate matter (mean: 278 ± 19 µg/m3), were protected from autonomic, cardiac electrophysiological, and lipid changes [57]. Cardiac electrophysiological changes were measured through heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiac repolarization while lipid levels and blood cells were analyzed to indicate lipid changes.",df772dec-b8d5-402e-a608-8ceddeb4c702
16,methods16," Participants who received a similar olive oil supplement were unprotected from cardiac electrophysiological and lipid changes. Fish oil supplementation attenuated concentrated ambient PM (CAP)-induced reductions in high frequency/low frequency ratio and elevations in normalized low-frequency heart rate variability (HRV). Furthermore, participants who consumed olive oil supplements experienced significant increases in their normalized low-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) immediately after exposure to concentrated ambient PM (CAP), which persisted for at least 20 h, while those given the fish oil supplements did not experience any significant alteration in heart rate variability (HRV) in response to concentrated ambient PM (CAP) exposures [57].",3ac1fbcb-99a3-4377-986c-730c9842fc7b
17,methods17," Furthermore, one RCT investigated the effect of olive oil compared to fish oil in mitigating endothelial dysfunction (a marker and risk factor for cardiovascular disease) and coagulation markers in response to a two-hour controlled exposure to concentrated ambient PM (CAP) (mean: 253 ± 16 µg/m3, by drawing ambient air from above the roof and passing it through a 2-stage aerosol Harvard concentrator that produces up to a 30-fold increase in particle number and mass) in 42 middle-aged volunteers. Participants who consumed 3 g of olive oil per day for 28 days experienced a statistically significant increase in flow mediated dilation and increases in fibrinolysis blood markers which indicate a protective effect to attenuate vascular effects of exposure to concentrated ambient PM (CAP). This effect was not seen in participants consuming 3 g of fish oil per day [58].",b8203f61-c0cb-4930-ba32-2a8d739e7d83
18,methods18," These results warrant further investigation because other studies found that fish oil supplements provided protection from air pollutants.   3.5. Sulforaphane Sulforaphane is a molecule often found in cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, that has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [66]. Due to its antioxidant nature, sulforaphane has been investigated for its ability to mitigate the adverse health effects of Traffic related air pollution (TRAP). Previous research conducted to investigate the effects of sulforaphane on the expression of oxidative stress genes revealed that sulforaphane had detoxification properties that could provide protection from the harm brought on by air pollutants [67].  A single blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to analyze the effects of standardized broccoli sprout extract on nasal inflammatory response after exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP).",da895cdf-9aec-4323-91a5-404829ce7aa7
19,methods19," diesel exhaust particles (DEP) exposures of 300 µg in an aqueous suspension were administered from a dilution tunnel constant volume sampler. A standardized dose of 100 micromolar sulforaphane broccoli sprout extract in mango juice was given to 29 healthy adult participants for four consecutive days. Participants consuming the juice exhibited a lower inflammatory response (white blood cell counts) to the diesel exhaust particles (DEP) compared to the control. [59]. Another randomized, placebo-controlled trial in China investigated whether daily consumption of a broccoli sprout beverage for 12 weeks could ameliorate the detrimental effects of benzene exposure. Participants who received the broccoli sprout beverage had a statistically significant higher urinary S-phenyl mercapturic acid (S phenyl mercapturic acid (SPMA)) and hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (3-HPMA) excretion [60].",cf06ff46-1eac-4acd-b230-95ee468d955e
20,methods20," S phenyl mercapturic acid (SPMA) and 3-HPMA are markers for exposure to benzene air pollution because they are levels of mercapturic acids formed in the metabolism of benzene. These levels increase as a result of benzene exposure. Increased level of excretion of S phenyl mercapturic acid (SPMA) and 3-HPMA indicates that the broccoli sprout beverage enhanced detoxification of pollutants. While the broccoli sprout beverages prove to be useful in mitigating the adverse effects associated with the exposures to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) and benzene, participants in the studies often complained of the beverage’s bad taste, and some experienced nausea from the drink.  3.6. Vitamin C and Vitamin E Vitamin C and vitamin E have been the focus of several studies due to being inexpensive antioxidants that are widely taken as supplements across the world.",c87a7c6d-8008-4ddb-992b-3363fb8018f3
21,methods21," In a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Mexico, asthmatic children (7 and 11 years) were given a supplement comprising of 50 mg vitamin E and 250 mg vitamin C with measurements of nasal lavages were taken 3 times during a 4 month follow up and analyzed for content of interleukin-6, IL-8, uric acid, and glutathione. Children who received the placebo had statistically significant increases in interleukin-6 (IL-6; a marker of inflammation) in nasal lavage that was associated with O3 and PM10 exposure, while children receiving the antioxidant supplement did not [61]. However, the study did not account for information regarding allergens, which limits the results.   4. Discussion 4.1. Summary and Key Findings This literature review provides evidence that antioxidant-rich diets and antioxidant supplements can protect against the adverse health effects associated with exposure to air pollution, and specifically, Traffic related air pollution (TRAP).",b6a4a949-fc19-47d5-a7ca-088fc6bdb6d5
22,methods22," The evidence is largely consistent and originates from RCTs with relatively small numbers of volunteers and a limited number of population-based cohort studies. The data suggests that increased antioxidant intake, whether it be through diet or supplementation, can blunt the adverse health effects of exposure to common traffic-related air pollutants. However, the number of studies investigating this question is rather small (11) and further research is required to replicate and confirm previous findings.  Antioxidant-rich diets, such as the Mediterranean diet and increased fruit and vegetable intake, gave the most promising evidence for protection from Traffic related air pollution (TRAP). On the other hand, the benefits of olive oil, a feature of the Mediterranean diet, were inconsistent between studies. These results warrant further research in order to determine the effectiveness of olive oil in mitigating adverse health effects from Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) exposure.",6bd203be-1502-4f64-9b07-b85543cbd92f
23,methods23," In contrast, fish oil supplements provided more consistently effective results in mitigating the effects of Traffic related air pollution (TRAP). Fish oil supplements are relatively cheap and can be accessed easily without prescription. In addition to taking fish oil supplements, people could also increase their intake through diet by consuming fish rich in oils (n-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)). Fish that are rich in n-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) include sockeye salmon, farmed trout and salmon, Copper River salmon, Coho salmon, bronzini, and toothfish [68]. The effective dose of fish oil (in diet or as supplements) requires further research. Broccoli sprout beverages containing sulforaphane also mitigated the adverse health effects of Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) exposure, albeit only two studies that were identified.",fcb570ef-0532-4cd2-9c7c-03f15c387549
24,methods24," However, people may be unlikely to consume a broccoli sprout beverage regularly if they dislike the taste or experience side effects such as mild gastrointestinal upset [59]. Finally, vitamin C and vitamin E were investigated in one study and were found to reduce inflammation associated with air pollution exposure. While the evidence suggests that vitamin C and E supplements may be useful in providing protection from Traffic related air pollution (TRAP), the overall findings of large clinical trials of these antioxidants assessing mortality and clinically-relevant end-points have been disappointing [69]. Concerningly, a meta-analysis of 19 clinical trials using vitamin E supplements found that high doses (≥400 IU/d for at least 1 year) of vitamin E may even increase all-cause mortality [70]. Vitamin C and E should therefore not be taken in high doses and consumed with precaution until there is more research to determine their effective dose to protect from pollutants.",a5faef52-3846-4871-8540-a2bbcde320c7
25,methods25," For all anti-oxidants identified in the literature, more research is needed to determine their appropriate dosages. Once the effective dose for each of these supplements is determined, they could offer a relatively cheap and accessible method to increase antioxidant intake, thus increasing protection from Traffic related air pollution (TRAP). Other factors to be considered when investigating the effectiveness of antioxidant supplementation would be the time the antioxidant is consumed, duration of supplementation, the balance between diet and supplementation, the amount of antioxidants that reach the bloodstream and whether or not antioxidants reach the areas of disease or subcellular locations.",3ffb114f-86f0-4c9b-85eb-07023fc5bff1
26,methods26," Further points of interest include what formulations can be used to increase bioavailability of antioxidants, whether formulations can be used to target specific organs or diseases, whether antioxidants combat only some parts of the disease pathways and not others, if are antioxidants useful for specific patient subgroups and not others, and finally, whether combinations of antioxidants needed to fully target multiple free radicals and disease processes.  Based on the results of this review, increasing people’s fruit and vegetable intake as well as encouraging adherence to the Mediterranean diet seem to be the most promising strategy. In addition to offering protection against Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) effects, dietary interventions are associated with other co-benefits, such as reduced mortality and reduced risk of diseases overall by decreasing the inflammatory response associated with exposure and mitigating oxidant damage to cell structures [69].",f1821906-ff4d-450e-9acd-7bf52b48e4ae
27,methods27," Furthermore, dietary changes that increase antioxidant intake should be encouraged for all people, and especially for susceptible populations such as children, the elderly, asthmatics and those who are occupationally exposed to Traffic related air pollution (TRAP). Those who suffer from preexisting chronic conditions and chronic inflammation [48] and those who have damaged or weakened antioxidant defense systems may be more susceptible to oxidative stress [71]. Children are also a susceptible population because their organ systems are still developing, and therefore there is a greater cellular susceptibility to oxidative stress. Likewise, elderly persons have an increased susceptibility due to weakened immune and detoxification systems. Transportation workers, taxi drivers, construction workers, and street vendors may experience greater exposures to Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) due to their occupational location and/or type of work.",4d64b388-1705-4756-8d4e-eeaacfe9a8bf
28,methods28," Indeed, a study revealed that taxi drivers had higher levels of oxidative stress biomarkers, increases in pro-inflammatory mediators and an increased risk for cardiovascular events, compared to non-occupationally exposed persons [72]. Genetic abnormalities can also engender greater susceptibility to more oxidative stress [73]. Polymorphisms in genes involved in oxidative stress such as NAD(P)Quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione-S-transferase (GSTM1 or GSTP1) have been found to alter response to pollutants. For example, genetic variations in these genes led to a greater nasal inflammation, increased airway epithelial damage, and higher levels of oxidative stress in response to O3 exposure [73]. It is worth noting that 5 of the 11 articles included in this review investigated populations of potential susceptibility. Two RCTs enrolled elderly participants, 1 RCT enrolled asthmatic children, 1 cohort study investigated children, and 1 considered prenatal exposures of infants.",9abdecd1-1d99-469a-b31d-efb7ac0ab010
29,methods29,"  4.2. Comparison with Previous Studies The findings of this literature review are consistent with findings of previous relevant studies. For instance, a RCT in 80 adults in Brazil investigated the effect of antioxidant supplementation (6 month of 500 mg of vitamin C and 800 mg of vitamin E) on biomarkers of oxidative stress linked to PM exposure originating from coal combustion emissions [74]. While this study is specifically not a Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) exposure, there are similarities between the health effects of both these combustion-derived emissions and their pathways of action. Level of exposure was determined by whether people were directly exposed (those who handle the mineral coal), indirectly exposed (office workers of the electric power plant 200 m from the burning area), residents (subjects living in the city 2 kilometers from the burning area) or non-exposed subjects (controls who lived 100 km from the emissions).",1f4f5dc9-c64f-4930-998d-3545d482bf8f
30,methods30," After taking the antioxidant supplement for 6 months, participants in all groups who were exposed to PM emissions (direct exposure, indirect exposure, and residents) had similar levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress as the control group [74].   Older studies before time frame for this literature review’s search criteria also present evidence that antioxidant supplementation can mitigate the adverse health effects of air pollution. A controlled trial in the Netherlands, investigated the use of a supplement (650 mg of vitamin C, 75 mg of vitamin E and 15 mg of beta carotene) in 26 young amateur cyclists exposed to O3. The cyclists who took the supplement experienced no effect from the O3 exposure on lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second, forced vital capacity, peak expiratory flow, and maximal mid expiratory flow) while the control group that received a placebo had adverse responses to O3 [75].",65848672-b46c-4fa9-83ef-c18bb1e0300e
31,methods31," A double-blinded randomized trial in 158 children with asthma in Mexico City investigated the use of daily supplementation (50 mg of vitamin E and 250 mg of vitamin C). This study revealed that daily antioxidant supplementation provided protection against exacerbation of asthma symptoms from O3 and NO2 exposures [76]. Both studies provide more evidence supporting the claim that vitamin E and vitamin C can mitigate pulmonary decrements after exposure to traffic-related air pollutants and secondary pollutants (e.g., O3 which is promoted by traffic-related emissions).  4.3. Limitations We did not intend this literature review to be an all-inclusive review of antioxidant interventions studied in relation to air pollution. Instead, we focused on human studies in the last 15 years, to provide a summation of recent findings that have relevance to Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) and highlight key research findings and gaps from the most up-to-date evidence base.",c6d6403b-2f79-4429-89db-dd107511fdc1
32,methods32," We acknowledge that the current review was non-systematic, searching specific databases and being limited to the last 15 years. Conducting a systematic review is likely to identify further evidence and potentially different conclusions. Furthermore, there is a substantial body of preclinical data from animals and cellular models that could provide useful mechanistic insight into the human observations.   Another potential limitation of this review stems from the limitations of the studies analyzed and the methodologies employed in the included papers. For example, RCTs are not representative of the combination of Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) exposures people experience in the real-world. Instead, they are usually limited to specific pollutants being tested in each experiment through controlled exposures.",68170967-3b00-4b35-ab40-4399b4690bf8
33,methods33," On the other hand, there are many benefits of controlled exposure studies over real-world investigations due to their ability to control exposures at specific rates over specific time periods and the minimization of bias, especially selection bias and confounding. Another limitation relates to the exposure assessment in the included studies. Often, exposure assessment was based on a fixed monitoring network rather than a personal monitor, which could lead to exposure misclassification. The increased availability of more accurate lower-cost personal sensors will allow gathering of more accurate individual exposures, or at the very least offer insight into the potential uncertainty arising from use of fixed monitoring data. The literature identified considered studies conducted in different geographic areas, which provides some benefits in terms of ascertaining the generalization of the observed effects in different populations.",5b551b8a-f1dc-4693-a424-dc169c3ff4cd
34,methods34," However, it also introduces other factors that could be confounders (e.g., different air pollution mixtures in different regions, genetic background, socioeconomic variables, differences in diet, and compliance for taking supplements). Finally, in several of the antioxidant supplement studies, some aspects of participants’ diets were not controlled for or only adjusted for at baseline, with no tracking of changes over the follow-up period.   4.4. Research Recommendations This short review raises the need for a systematic review of literature on this topic, however, it also allows us to make recommendations for practical research topics. We recommend that future studies specifically investigate the effects of antioxidants on vulnerable populations, such as children with asthma, the elderly, certain occupational workers and people with genetic susceptibility as these subpopulations may benefit the most from targeted dietary or supplemental interventions.",f6e025a3-8d4c-4a74-8029-4fdf7c71e510
35,methods35," Although several of the studies identified did focus on susceptible populations, it would be beneficial to expand the literature regarding those who experience increased responses to Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) and specifically investigate genetic susceptibilities possibly in different ethnic populations. In the included studies, many participants were generally healthy adults. While healthy adults are also at risk of the adverse effects of Traffic related air pollution (TRAP), young and healthy adults may be more likely to consume better foods and be more active than the general population, which could influence exposure and response to pollutants and antioxidants [46]. Furthermore, this review warrants more detailed research regarding the role that obesity may play in the adverse health effects associated with Traffic related air pollution (TRAP).",5e020dc4-b313-4b8b-aaae-92816be2e294
36,methods36," Obesity continues to be a major threat to health and contributes to other Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) health effects listed in this review, such as asthma [77]. A vulnerable population that has not been discussed in the literature is lower socioeconomic status individuals. These populations exhibit a variety of factors which might heighten their risk of adverse health effects from Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) exposures, including exposure to violence, stress, reduced access to health care and poor diet [78]. Additionally, there is a need for further investigation on the effective dose of antioxidant supplements, as well as a greater insight into reasons for conflicting results regarding the effectiveness of different antioxidant diets (e.g., fish oil and olive oil). Future research would also benefit from control for confounding effects from daily dietary intakes and changes in diet over follow-up.",33b7e297-0cc4-439c-8bc5-68b8bd8ec7d1
37,methods37," It should be noted that curcumin, an Asian spice that has antioxidant properties, was not included in this review. A meta-analysis suggests that the antioxidant properties of curcumin could mitigate depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients [79]. Therefore, future research could be aimed at investigating the potential for curcumin to mitigate the burden of disease caused by Traffic related air pollution (TRAP). Finally, more research could be undertaken to evaluate the potential of antioxidants in mitigating air pollution effects in other organs or diseases of the body than were discussed in this paper.  4.5. Policy Recommendations Policy makers should continue to pursue legislation that would reduce levels of Traffic related air pollution (TRAP). In 2016, 91% of the world’s population still lived in areas that exceeded the World Health Organization air quality guideline values [80], which are even too high to fully protect public health.",7ad7fa25-5223-4c57-a05f-32d6a9bf26da
38,methods38," However, until the long-term goal of cleaning the air can be met, policy makers could consider the use of antioxidant-rich diets, and to a lesser extent supplements, as a means of mitigating adverse health effects associated with Traffic related air pollution (TRAP). For example, schools in highly polluted areas may be incentivized to serve lunches that are antioxidant rich. Simple changes to a school lunch menu could be serving oil rich and organic fish at least once a week and increasing the organic fruits and vegetables at every meal. Furthermore, nursing homes and other care facilities for older adults should consider employing the use of antioxidant-rich diets. In addition to the Mediterranean diet reducing inflammation and mitigating adverse health effects of Traffic related air pollution (TRAP), there is evidence that the Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil and mixed nuts can reduce age related cognitive decline in the elderly [81].",85702027-bf70-4227-950f-c68a18c3d96d
39,methods39," Such evidence might be applicable to the increasing body of evidence showing that air pollution, and Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) specifically, is linked to cognitive decline [33,34,35,82]. It is important to address Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) in particular as vehicles are one of the major sources of ambient air pollution, which specifically act in close proximity to an increasing proportion of people, thus making the adverse impacts of Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) exposure widespread [78,80].  4.6. Practice Recommendations Clinicians and health practitioners should encourage their clients to consume an antioxidant-rich diet and increase their organic fruit and vegetable intake, especially for children, elderly, pregnant women, and asthmatics. A cost-effective population-based intervention would be to bring awareness to the importance of dietary practices.",c7d5a6f7-60fc-4aa2-b66b-6ed007e43650
40,methods40," Furthermore, occupations that are chronically exposed to Traffic related air pollution (TRAP), such as construction workers, transportation workers, and street vendors, should recommend or incentivize their employees to increase their nutritional or supplemental antioxidant intake. Raising awareness in dietary health benefits can be provided relatively easily, for little cost and in a manner that goes hand-in-hand with improving education for all on the health risks of air pollution.  5. Conclusions Antioxidants may reduce the effects of oxidative stress because they can remove oxidizing agents and inhibit oxidation. Because of this, an antioxidant-rich diet or antioxidant supplement intake can potentially be used as a preventive strategy for the harmful health effects of Traffic related air pollution (TRAP).",58c2c4a2-a37e-463e-ade4-0e998b4d29ab
41,methods41," In this literature review, we identified 11 papers in the last 15 years that considered the potential benefits of increased antioxidant intake through diet or supplementation on mitigating the adverse health effects of exposure to common traffic-related air pollutants. Antioxidant interventions investigated ranged from adherence to the Mediterranean diet, increased fruit and vegetable intake, consumption of fish oil and olive oil, sulforaphane intake via broccoli sprout beverages, and vitamin C and E supplements. Major points to note from the literature include fruit and vegetable rich diets, the Mediterranean diet, fish oils and vitamin C and vitamin E provide protection from the adverse health effects associated with Traffic related air pollution (TRAP).",c7609287-9f4f-4bd5-92f8-1c88a8920e47
42,methods42," Greater adherence to a diet rich in fruits and vegetables or the Mediterranean diet was effective in reducing the adverse health effects associated with Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) and had no negative effects associated with them. While there are inevitably inconsistencies in the findings, the overall weight of evidence suggest that antioxidant intake can ameliorate the effects of Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) in different organ systems. There is good evidence to recommend that healthy and susceptible individuals should practice greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and increase their fruit and vegetable intake. There is conflicting evidence regarding the use of antioxidant supplements and thus a need for more research focusing on antioxidant supplementation. Future research should focus on conducting cohort studies to analyze long-term effectiveness of antioxidants in studies that are representative of real-world exposures and with better control for confounders.",982fdcdb-25da-465f-be55-653e0a83e59b
43,methods43," Given the near ubiquitous exposure to pollution worldwide, and the huge impact on health, these findings have relevance to the general public, but also to health practitioners, clinicians, employers and policymakers seeking to limit the burden of air pollution on health. Specifically, susceptible populations including asthmatics, elderly and those with genetic variations should increase their antioxidant intake in order to attenuate the adverse health effects associated with air pollution and Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) exposures. In conclusion, until lower levels of Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) are achieved, antioxidant-rich diets and supplementation may offer promise for reducing the burden of disease associated with Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) exposures.

Other aspects of the participants’ diets were not controlled for.

Randomization of either a daily supplement (50 mg vitamin E and 250 mg vitamin C) or a placebo with measurements of nasal lavages taken 3 times during a 4 month follow up and analyzed form content of interleukin-6, IL-8, uric acid and glutathione.	Mixed effect models were used to analyze longitudinal data adjusted for age, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, atopy, temperature, relative humidity, asthma severity, week of the study, total protein, use of corticoids and uric acid levels in nasal lavage. Regression coefficients were compared using a t-test to estimate the effect of the supplementation.",fac79476-a189-4330-a8e6-0854534e69b3
73,methods73,"	After ozone exposure, children who received the placebo had statistically significant increases in interleukin-6 (IL-6) in nasal lavage while children receiving the supplement did not. Results were similar for interleukin-8 but were not significant. Uric acid decreased slightly in the placebo group.	IL-8 is a mediator of inflammation. Antioxidant supplements, such as vitamin C and E, could decrease the nasal inflammatory response to air pollutants. The main limitations reported by the authors were the exposure assessment being based on a monitoring network and not a personal measurement which could lead to misclassification of exposure, and the fact that the authors did not account for information of allergens indoors and outdoors. =",bbea7ee2-57e8-4dbf-881f-e47240064f6d
