0,methods0," Study population: The PREDIMED-Plus trial (from the Spanish “PREvention with MEDiterranean DIet”) is an ongoing study launched in Spain in 2013 to assess the effect of an intensive lifestyle intervention—energy-restricted Mediterranean diet, increased physical activity and behavioral support—on the incidence of cardiovascular events and weight loss and its long-term maintenance. Details about the cohort have been described previously [50] and the study protocol, including study design and data collection, can be found at the PREDIMED-Plus website (https://www.predimedplus.com/en/, accessed on 20 May 2020). Briefly, the trial involves 6874 participants (48.5% female and 54.5% male) between 55–75 years old (mean age and SD 65.0 ± 4.9) who presented with overweight or obesity (27 ≤ Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤ 40 kg/m2) and met at least three criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS) as previously described [51].",8518d44d-f25a-4496-a450-b7eaf5a0c183
1,methods1," The trial was designed as a 6-year, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial conducted in 23 Spanish study centers. The study protocol was approved according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of all participating centers and all participants provided written consent of their participation in the study. This trial was retrospectively registered at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Registry with number 89898870 on 24th July 2014. In the present analysis, baseline data from the PREDIMED-Plus study data set dated 26th June 2020 was used. These data correspond to data at the beginning of the study, before the dietary intervention took place. Participants with missing values for cardiometabolic variables were not included in the analysis. In addition, participants with implausible intakes (<500 or >3500 kcal for females and <800 or >4000 kcal for males) were excluded.",ae099755-21b0-4d7b-bf10-7b988c0745fa
2,methods2," The final number of participants included in the analysis was 5636 (48.5% female and 51.5% male, mean age and SD: 65.1 ± 4.9) (Figure 1). This study adhered to the Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) cross-sectional reporting guidelines [52].  Anthropometric and blood measurements: The weight and waist circumference measurements were taken from participants in light clothing with no shoes or accessories, using an electronic calibrated scale and an anthropometric tape, respectively. Waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest. Height measurements were taken using a wall-mounted stadiometer. Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate with a sphygmomanometer in a sitting position and after 5 min rest, and the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was calculated.",be1cdeda-21e7-47f4-a395-f98f1454c176
3,methods3," Blood samples were collected after overnight fasting by trained nurses at the recruiting centers or primary health care centers associated with the study. Plasma glucose, triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), creatinine, total and HDL cholesterol levels were measured following standard enzymatic methods. LDL cholesterol concentration was calculated using the Friedewald formula [53].  Dietary, nutritional and lifestyle measurements: A semi-quantitative 143-item food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) was used to assess the diet of participants over the last year at baseline, before the dietary intervention. For each food or beverage item, participants were asked the average frequency of consumption of a commonly used portion size for that item (e.g., glass, cup, and slice) over the previous year. Nine options for frequency of consumption are given, ranging from “never or hardly ever” to “more than six times a day.",a7bfce82-c5df-43e6-8b63-90ee02da1da0
4,methods4,"” This food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) has been repeatedly validated in the Spanish population [54,55,56] and considers variations in dietary patterns among seasons, weekdays and weekends. To estimate the daily consumption for each food or beverage item, the portion size was multiplied by the frequency of consumption and then expressed as grams per day. In the case of nutrient variables, data were estimated from food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) responses considering all items that contribute to that nutrient intake, using food composition tables explicitly developed for Spanish dietary habits [57,58]. Adherence to an energy-restricted Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) was assessed using a 17-item questionnaire specially developed and validated for the PREDIMED-Plus trial [59].",0cf9fd0a-a807-4674-b0fc-a0b624283f57
5,methods5," Participants were asked about the use or frequency of consumption of traditional Mediterranean food items and scored one point when the answer was in agreement with specific criteria defining energy-restricted MedDiet. Therefore, the higher the score, the better adherence to this diet. The glycemic index (GI) for each participant’s diet was estimated from the calculated glycemic load (GL) for that participant, as the GL multiplied by 100 and divided by the grams of carbohydrates consumed per day. Physical activity and smoking data were collected through the general PREDIMED-Plus questionnaire. Participants were asked about the frequency and intensity of physical activities, and three levels of PA were defined as follows: low (frequent sitting and little walking and/or frequent sitting and moderate sustained efforts), medium (frequent walking with no vigorous efforts), and high (frequent walking and vigorous efforts and/or frequent vigorous efforts).",e25395ce-a30c-43de-aa76-76eca8c0db9f

The NOVA system developed by the Public Health Faculty of the University of São Paulo (Brazil) classifies food according to the extent and purpose of their industrial processing [16,33,43].",28f01750-f9d4-48b0-9a2d-bfff891292b1
7,methods7," The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) system was established in Europe by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)) using the methodology design for the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)), and it classifies foods according to their level of physical processing [11,44]. The International Food Information Council (IFIC) system was developed by the International Food Information Council Foundation (International Food Information Council (IFIC)) in the United States (US), and the classifying criteria are based on the increasing complexity of food processing and chemical composition [45,46].",5ec8bbf5-7eb1-4ffb-904e-2727bbe4042b
8,methods8," The University of North Carolina (UNC) system was also developed in the US by the University of North Carolina (University of North Carolina (UNC)) and classifies food according to the extent of physicochemical changes produced by food processing [47]. A total of 136 food and beverage items from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were allocated to processing groups according to food lists and descriptions found in the references cited above for each classification system (Figure 2 and Table S1). The ultra processed food (UPF) group was defined for each classification system as follows: Group 4 for NOVA, Group 3 for International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Groups 4 and 5 for International Food Information Council (IFIC), and Groups 4.1 and 4.2 for University of North Carolina (UNC).",68d56d49-6744-4ef4-9b52-35dbd58b7ff9
9,methods9," For each participant, ultra processed food (UPF) consumption was estimated as the sum of grams per day consumed from foods in the ultra processed food (UPF) group, divided by the total grams of food consumed per day and multiplied by 100. ultra processed food (UPF) consumption was calculated according to the items listed in the ultra processed food (UPF) group of each classification system (Table S1).  The following assumptions were made for particular food items to ensure consistency and avoid bias when applying different classifying criteria. These were based on the foods and cooking habits of the traditional Mediterranean diet in the Spanish population. Therefore, milk was assumed to be processed using ultra-heated temperature (ultra heated temperature (UHT)), and milkshakes, soft cheese wedges, custard and ice-cream were assumed to be industrially produced.",12179774-84f4-4f75-9ad5-1502f09661b7
10,methods10," Meat, fish, eggs and legumes were assumed to be raw or cooked in a basic manner; lettuce was assumed to be consumed raw; cabbage, carrot, peas, pumpkin, zucchini, garlic and onion were assumed to be cooked in a basic manner. When fish was not explicitly described, the same assumptions as for meat were made. Asparagus was assumed to be canned and of the white type. Raisins were assumed to be without added sugar; almonds were assumed to be toasted without salt; walnuts were assumed to be natural with no additions; pistachios were assumed to be salted and other nuts to be salted and/or roasted. Bread was assumed to be freshly baked and not packaged. Muesli included wholegrain cereals with no added sugar; butter was considered as salted, cocoa powder was assumed to contain added sugar, coffee was considered roasted in the form of ground beans (not soluble) and tea was included in the same category as other infusions (e.g., chamomile, green tea).

Participants were classified according to quintiles of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption for each classification system (Q1—lowest ultra processed food (UPF) consumption, Q5—highest ultra processed food (UPF) consumption). Data shown in tables are presented as “mean (standard deviation, SD)” for continuous variables and as percentages for categorical variables. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in cardiometabolic and nutritional variables among ultra processed food (UPF) quintiles were compared using one-way ANOVA tests. Post hoc analysis was performed using Tukey’s tests to detect pairwise statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between quintiles.",764b6ae2-47b3-4280-9c7f-672305955cc3
12,methods12," Differences between quintiles are expressed in the text as “estimate of the contrast Q1-Q5 ± standard error (SE)”. The association between ultra processed food (UPF) consumption and cardiometabolic variables (outcome variables) was analyzed with three linear regression models. ultra processed food (UPF) consumption, expressed as a percentage of total grams of food consumed per day, was divided by five and used as the predictor variable. Thus, regression models show the association between 5% increments in ultra processed food (UPF) consumption (approximately equivalent to 100 g/day) and cardiometabolic variables. Model 1 included age, gender and recruitment center as cofactors. Model 2 included total energy intake, physical activity level and education level, in addition to cofactors included in model 1.

13,methods13," Since data used correspond to data before the dietary intervention, the effect of the dietary intervention was not considered for statistical analysis. As sensitive analyses, two alternative estimations of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption were input in the models: “grams per day of ultra processed food (UPF) divided by body weight kilogram”, and “calorie-adjusted grams per day of ultra processed food (UPF)” using the residual method [67]. To assess the concordance between classification systems, the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC3) was calculated based on a single rating, absolute-agreement, 2-way mixed-effects model, following previously published guidelines [68] and using the “irr” package. Absolute subject agreement among quintiles was calculated as “number of subjects classified in the same quintile in both systems / total number of subjects × 100”.",5667007b-20e6-49c1-bee5-316a7a1152ef

There were differences in ultra processed food (UPF) consumption between females and males for all systems, with the highest difference shown by University of North Carolina (UNC), followed by International Food Information Council (IFIC) and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the lowest difference shown by NOVA. In all cases, females showed lower ultra processed food (UPF) consumption than males.  3.2. Nutritional Profile of ultra processed food (UPF) Consumption Quintiles According to the Classification System  For all classification systems, those subjects in the highest quintile of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption (Q5) had a higher intake of total energy, saturated fatty acids, simple sugars and sodium and a higher glycemic load compared to those in the lowest quintile (Q1) (Table 1).",5b4d9c16-a94e-4a70-ac86-bc1e3fd573f8
16,methods16," Likewise, for all systems, a lower intake of protein, fiber and omega-3 fatty acids was observed for subjects in the fifth quintile compared to those in the first quintile. Total fat intake, measured as a percentage of total energy intake, was higher in the highest ultra processed food (UPF) consumption quintile only with NOVA classification (ΔQ1 − Q5: −1.77 ± 0.28%, Tukey’s p < 0.001), while it was lower with International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) (ΔQ1 − Q5: 2.29 ± 0.28%, Tukey’s p < 0.001) and University of North Carolina (UNC) (ΔQ1 − Q5: 1.42 ± 0.28%, Tukey’s p < 0.001) and did not change with International Food Information Council (IFIC). The percentage of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids intake did not differ across ultra processed food (UPF) consumption quintiles using NOVA while decreasing with the other classification systems.

Association between Cardiometabolic Health Markers and ultra processed food (UPF) Consumption with Different Classification Systems  We first compared cardiometabolic health markers across ultra processed food (UPF) consumption quintiles and between Q1 and Q5 consumption quintiles for all systems. There were fewer females, a higher percentage of smokers, and lower MedDiet adherence in the highest quintile of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption for all classification systems compared to the lowest quintile (see Tables S6–S9). Compared to subjects in the lowest quintile, subjects in the highest quintile were younger and had higher body weight and waist circumference, and lower HDL blood levels.",e5ff0326-d6d0-47ab-a266-13edc59d53a5
18,methods18," Only in the case of NOVA, those with the highest ultra processed food (UPF) consumption had significantly higher Body Mass Index (BMI) (ΔQ1 − Q5: −0.72 ± 0.14 kg/m2, Tukey’s p < 0.001). Levels of HbA1c were only significantly lower in the highest quintile of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption with International Food Information Council (IFIC) (ΔQ1 − Q5: 0.15 ± 0.04% mmol/mol, Tukey’s p < 0.001). Triglycerides levels were significantly higher in Q5 with International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) (ΔQ1 − Q5: −7.07 ± 2.23 mg/dL, Tukey’s p = 0.014).

Subjects with the highest ultra processed food (UPF) consumption had higher diastolic blood pressure than those with the lowest ultra processed food (UPF) consumption for all systems except NOVA.  To analyze the association between ultra processed food (UPF) consumption and cardiometabolic health markers, we performed linear regression analyses based on a 5% increment in ultra processed food (UPF) consumption (summarized in Table 2). With the NOVA system, for a 5% increment in ultra processed food (UPF) consumption, Body Mass Index (BMI) was predicted to increase by 0.11 kg/m2, using the fully adjusted model (β = 0.11 kg/m2; CI = 0.05, 0.18; p = 0.001), whereas an association with higher weight and waist circumference was found with all classification systems (Table 3).",7ab7e000-8fb9-4ba1-9521-343ea629e2e8

22,methods22," Concordance and Subject Agreement between Classification Systems in Quintiles of ultra processed food (UPF) Consumption  Differences in cardiometabolic markers across quintiles of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption shown above may be related to subjects being classified to different quintiles for each classification system. Therefore, we calculated ICC3 coefficients to evaluate the concordance of the different classifications to allocate subjects to quintiles of ultra processed food (UPF). The ICC3 for the four classifications was 0.51, and all pairwise comparisons with NOVA resulted in lower ICC3 coefficients than the other pairwise comparisons (Table 4). We also conducted a pairwise comparison of the percentage of absolute subject agreement between the quintiles of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption.",232e2ec5-c157-4203-aa3c-4518d07e297f

The percentage of subjects in the same quintiles between International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)-International Food Information Council (IFIC) and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)-University of North Carolina (UNC) was 38.4%. This percentage was very similar for NOVA-International Food Information Council (IFIC) (32.3%) and NOVA-University of North Carolina (UNC) (30%).

24,methods24," Discussion  We analyzed differences in the association between ultra processed food (UPF) consumption and cardiometabolic markers, as well as in the nutritional profile of subjects with higher ultra processed food (UPF) consumption compared to subjects with lower ultra processed food (UPF) consumption, using four food processing-based classification systems on the same dataset. We showed that those with the highest ultra processed food (UPF) consumption exhibited nutritional markers of a poor-quality diet irrespective of the classification used. In addition, with all classifications, a positive association between ultra processed food (UPF) consumption and weight and waist circumference was found. Only with NOVA, a positive association between ultra processed food (UPF) consumption and Body Mass Index (BMI) was detected.",83d742b9-6bd5-4943-aa04-dfa5a3428034
25,methods25," Additionally, a positive association with systolic and diastolic blood pressure and fasting glucose levels was found only with University of North Carolina (UNC), and with HbA1c only using International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Marked differences were also detected in subject agreement between quintiles of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption, with the NOVA-International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) comparison showing the lowest concordance and percentage of subject agreement.  Our results revealed that individuals with the highest ultra processed food (UPF) consumption (Q5) had a higher intake of energy, simple sugars, saturated fat and sodium, as well as less fiber intake, lower adherence to the MedDiet and a higher glycemic load of the diet than those with the lowest consumption of ultra processed food (UPF) (Q1), regardless of the classification method (Table 1 and Tables S2–S9).",936f5fd2-a469-4440-b576-be9a3d87fbe3
26,methods26," This concurs with previous studies analyzing the nutritional profile of ultra processed food (UPF)s [33,69,70,71,72]. It is noteworthy that all four systems agreed on results for critical nutrients of which intake has been linked to disease risk, such as sugar [48,73,74], saturated fat [75,76] or sodium [77,78,79]. This consistency in the nutritional profile of subjects with higher ultra processed food (UPF) consumption supports the claim that food classifications based on food processing are nutritionally relevant, and therefore are useful in epidemiological studies and dietary recommendations [71,80]. Indeed, a recent study revealed that sodium and added sugar were significant predictors of highly processed foods according to the NOVA, University of North Carolina (UNC) and International Food Information Council (IFIC) classifications [70].",f9a1ff48-4f7d-494a-8f8a-38b2e5b49a71
27,methods27,"  In support of our initial hypothesis, applying different food processing-based classification systems to the PREDIMED-Plus data set resulted in different associations between ultra processed food (UPF) consumption and cardiometabolic markers. For example, only with NOVA, the Q5 group showed significantly higher Body Mass Index (BMI) than the Q1 group, which was confirmed by the regression analysis. This concurs with previous studies that have used the NOVA system [13,24,81,82]. Additionally, ultra processed food (UPF) consumption was directly associated with weight and waist circumference with all classifications, with NOVA showing the highest β value. Notably, many studies use Body Mass Index (BMI) as an obesity-related parameter, and thus the choice of classification system could severely affect the conclusions reached regarding ultra processed food (UPF) consumption and cardiometabolic risk factors.",ec8b894f-8d00-4f85-bacc-19ccf383a39b
28,methods28,"  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified the largest number of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) food items as ultra processed food (UPF) (60.7%) as opposed to NOVA (27.4%) (Figure S1). These results agree with a previous study [42] but in contrast to another [70]. This difference may be due to the different sources used to generate the food list utilized for the classification. Since Spanish dietary patterns are part of the MedDiet, the PREDIMED-Plus food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) considers the cooking habits and distinctive foods of this diet [54,55]. This includes cooking at home and a wide variety of minimally processed foods as main components [83,84]. However, US dietary patterns have been characterized by a higher content of refined grains, sugar, salt and saturated fats [85,86,87,88] and particularly a higher consumption of ultra processed food (UPF)s compared to other Western countries [6,11,28,47].",ce857f2a-9195-4fb2-9f94-ed164de6ad11
29,methods29," Therefore, most foods fall under unprocessed to moderately processed categories when using NOVA on the PREDIMED-Plus food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). On the contrary, its use in the context of the US diet, with an already higher presence of ultra processed food (UPF)s, results in a larger amount of foods allocated into highly processed categories, as in the cited study [70]. This may be the same reason why the University of North Carolina (UNC) system, based on a NOVA adaptation for foods in US supermarkets [47], has more detailed categories and is more permissive with the characteristics of highly processed foods. The specific features of the Western dietary pattern may also underlie the similarities in ultra processed food (UPF) consumption with International Food Information Council (IFIC) and University of North Carolina (UNC) (Figure 3).",6c27c925-e106-4aa3-9f6c-666ef6b58164
30,methods30," These results highlight an important idea: the choice of food classification system should consider the specific characteristics of the diet from which foods are evaluated.  The context in which a food processing-based classification system is applied may also determine which system to use. For instance, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) system was framed within cancer research and defines “processing” as any modification to raw food, including even the most basic cooking-at-home methods such as boiling or grilling [11]. This is due to the reported associations of specific cooking methods and processed foods with certain cancers [38,39,89,90]. For instance, processed meat consumption has been reported as a convincing cause of colorectal cancer [91].",39fb1da4-95bf-402a-b438-b26809a5029f
31,methods31," Considering this, the orientation of International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study towards cancer research may result in a more conservative definition of highly industrially processed foods [11], a feature that clearly sets it apart from the other food classification frameworks. Therefore, it seems that the heterogeneity among results obtained with different systems could be partially due to discrepancies in the definition and consequences of food processing, as well as in the under- or overestimation of cooking habits, preservation methods and particular foods (e.g., ultra heated temperature (UHT)-milk, olive oil, see Table S1).",d16fdfd8-44ae-44e1-bb45-d4b05be9d3ca
32,methods32," In addition, remarkable differences in the composition of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption quintiles, illustrated by the low overall concordance and subject agreement between NOVA and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) (Table 4), may account for result variability. This analysis demonstrates that differential allocation of food items by each system effectively results in substantial differences in subject grouping, further supporting a strong influence of the food classification system on research outcomes.  Some limitations should be noted when interpreting results from this study. First, this is a cross-sectional analysis and therefore, a causal link between ultra processed food (UPF) consumption and the analyzed variables cannot be inferred.",76abeb94-bf89-4368-987d-97ea9b75c9f1
33,methods33," Second, although the suitability of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s for evaluating dietary consumption in large epidemiological studies is undeniable [55], it does present limitations regarding recall bias [56] and nutrient intake estimation [92,93]. The latter is even more pronounced when highly processed foods are considered, as there is a wide variety and they are not present in food composition tables. Therefore, it would be worth considering the inclusion of food processing-criteria when designing food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s for studies aimed to investigate the role of ultra processed food (UPF)s on health [80]. Third, assumptions about dietary patterns, cooking methods and food composition and processing were made to ensure consistency when applying the criteria of different systems, but foods may fall into different categories when other dietary patterns are considered.",69e8bce5-e03c-47fd-ad72-b4f77047ecb4
34,methods34," Finally, the PREDIMED-Plus cohort used for our analysis is characterized by the presence of MetS; hence, subjects already have high levels of cardiometabolic risk markers, which may mask potential differences due to ultra processed food (UPF) consumption. In addition, this is an elderly cohort that probably has lower ultra processed food (UPF) consumption than younger cohorts.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, the use of different food classifications on the same data set showed that ultra processed food (UPF) consumption might have a negative impact on the nutritional quality of the diet, whereas its association with cardiometabolic markers differed significantly depending on the system used.",cac52c17-7041-4d3b-9aec-2ce523a55569
35,methods35," With NOVA, high ultra processed food (UPF) consumption was associated with higher Body Mass Index (BMI), whereas University of North Carolina (UNC) showed an association with higher glucose levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) with higher HbA1c levels. Additionally, all systems revealed an association with higher weight and waist circumference, and all systems but NOVA with higher total and HDL cholesterol levels. These results support the importance of standardization of criteria to classify processed foods. This will allow epidemiological research to be translated effectively into easily understandable guidelines for the general public. For instance, the development of tools that effectively assess ultra processed food (UPF) consumption will aid in the identification of food groups of which consumption is excessive or associated with disease marks.",50511589-9244-458a-a85a-d9ee4d0f5aeb
36,methods36," Public health recommendations could then include the limitation of consumption of these food groups. In addition, this will help to establish relationships between disease marks and ultra processed food (UPF) consumption, according to which public health policies could be designed. Therefore, such tools should be available not only for the scientific community with epidemiological purposes, but also for policy makers and clinicians. ",716f03ca-27e9-459f-9ed0-79f26a98d814
