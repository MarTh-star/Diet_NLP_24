0,introduction0,"Mediterranean diet is the traditional eating pattern of populations around the Mediterranean Sea in Southern Europe [1]. It is usually characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish and olive oil, low consumption of milk and meat and moderate intake of alcohol [2, 3]. Mediterranean diet has found to be protective against cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular (CVD)) and other chronic conditions in numerous observational epidemiological studies, as well as in primary and secondary prevention trials [4–6]. Mediterranean diet score (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)), the indicator of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, based on consumption of selected foods, was first introduced by Trichopoulou in 1995 [7], and several modified versions of the original score have been developed since then [3].",f5f6dbb0-3915-447f-a6d7-88c45d080f03
1,introduction1,"  The associations between Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and mortality outcomes have been investigated primarily in Southern European countries and less frequently in non-Mediterranean populations. One small study (n = 411) in Eastern Europe among elderly people was inconclusive [8].  An important disadvantage of Mediterranean diet score (MDS) definitions used previously is that component scores for diet composition are based on sample-specific cut-off values (usually sex-specific medians). Scoring can differ substantially between study samples and may not reflect meaningful differences between healthy and unhealthy food intakes [9]. In addition, relative cut-off points do not allow comparison of Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s between populations. For these reasons, Sofi et al. developed a scoring system which uses absolute cut-off values determined by a review of food intake distributions in previous Mediterranean diet score (MDS) studies [10].",2092bce4-ab90-4e64-b9e3-f375276c322e
2,introduction2," This new Mediterranean diet score (MDS) has the potential to overcome the limitations of previous versions of Mediterranean diet score (MDS), but it has not been tested in relation to disease outcomes.  The aim of our study was to assess the association between the Mediterranean diet and total, cardiovascular (CVD), coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) and stroke mortality in large Eastern European populations using the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with absolute cut-off values as proposed [10].

3,methods0,"Study design and subjects We conducted a prospective cohort study based on the Health Alcohol and Psychosocial Factors in Eastern Europe (Health Alcohol and Psychosocial factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE)) project. The details, including the methods applied for dietary and mortality data collection, have been described previously [11–13].  Briefly, the baseline data collection took place between 2002 and 2005 in Krakow (Poland), Novosibirsk (Russia) and six cities in the Czech Republic. Overall, 28,945 middle-aged man and women were randomly selected from population/electoral registers (response rate 59 %). Participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire, provided blood sample and underwent a brief medical examination. All participants signed informed consent. The study protocols were approved by ethical committees at University College London and at each participating centre.",8c5889ca-063e-4613-b05f-f451b1393b94
4,methods1,"  Dietary assessment Dietary data were collected with semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), covering 136, 148 and 147 food and drink items in the Czech, Polish and Russian cohorts, respectively. Using a nine-point scale, participants indicated how frequently a particular food or drink item was consumed over the previous 3 months. Daily intakes of the different food groups were calculated using the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) food classification system [14] and country-specific portion sizes, and the McCance and Widdowson Food Composition Database was used to calculate nutrient intake levels [15]. The relative validity of the FFQ data regarding fruit, vegetable and micronutrient intakes was assessed by estimating correlations with concentration biomarkers in a random sub-sample of study subjects.",2270b371-27e1-4044-92bf-3644410f16c7
5,methods2," Pearson’s partial correlation coefficients between fruit intake and vitamin C and beta-carotene plasma concentrations in the pooled Health Alcohol and Psychosocial factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) sample were 0.29 and 0.05, respectively. The correlation coefficients for vegetable intake were 0.11 and 0.17, respectively [13].  The Mediterranean diet score (MDS) applied in this study followed the recommendations of Sofi et al [10] who defined absolute cut-off values for all Mediterranean diet score (MDS) components and applied a three-tier scoring system with zero, one or two points given to participants for each component (Table 1). The component regarding olive oil usage had to be modified because the corresponding question in the FFQ did not allow distinction between occasional, frequent and regular users.",f4f6fe38-74ee-4540-821b-1d67fd83fcb1
6,methods3," We gave one point for this component to those participants who stated that they used olive oil for cooking, and zero point to those who reported to cook with any other type of oil. As a result, after adding up the individual component scores, overall Mediterranean diet score (MDS) ranged from zero to 17.Table 1 Scoring criteria of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) components and the percentage of participants with maximum Mediterranean diet score (MDS) component scores  Components	Scoring criteria of Mediterranean diet score (MDS) components	% of participants with maximuma component scores	 	Czech	Polish	Russian	Total	 	0 point	1 point	2 points	Males (n = 2648)	Females (n = 3319)	Males (n = 3083)	Females (n = 3460)	Males (n = 3056)	Females (n = 3767)	Males (n = 8787)	Females (n = 10,546)	 Vegetables (g/day)	<100	100–250	>250	21.3	35.9	29.5	32.8	39.0	41.4	30.4	36.9	 Fruits and nuts (g/day)	<150	150–300	>300	37.9	59.1	33.0	45.5	8.2	15.0	25.9	38.9	 Legumes (g/week)	<70	70–140	>140	60.",0c6dd85e-fd48-4335-931b-0790b65cc44c
7,methods5," There were 70 individuals who died over the course of follow-up with unknown cause of death. These participants were included in the analysis if the outcome was total mortality, but excluded when the associations with cardiovascular (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality outcomes were assessed.  Analytical sample In order to avoid reverse causation, we excluded all subjects with prevalent cardiovascular (CVD) or diabetes at study baseline (n = 6525). Participants with missing follow-up data (n = 1048), missing FFQ data for more than 10 % of the listed items (n = 685), extreme energy intake reporters (basal metabolic rate vs. reported energy intake ratio in the top and bottom 1 % of the distribution) (n = 548) and those who stated that the FFQ was not representative to their diet (n = 806) were also omitted from the analysis.

8,methods6,"  Multiple imputation of missing covariate data A total of 3106 individuals (16 % of the analytical sample) had missing data on at least one of the following variables: marital status, smoking habits, alcohol intake, education, household amenities score, physical activity, BMI, vitamin supplement intake, mean arterial blood pressure, serum cholesterol level or olive oil usage. Missing at random assumption was considered reasonable because sensitivity analysis showed that “missingness” was significantly associated with several covariates and the results of the analysis on non-imputed data set, using listwise deletion technique, did not differ considerably from our main findings. Ten imputed data sets were created using the “mi impute chained” command in STATA v.13.1 [17, 18]. Age, sex, country cohort, follow-up time and all-cause mortality were applied as predictor variables. ",20b79fbf-67b4-43c1-9942-4b52448cb74d
9,analysis0,"Participants’ adherence to the Mediterranean diet was classified as low (0–7 points), moderate (8–10 points) and high (11–17 points) according to their Mediterranean diet score (MDS). These categories reflect similar fraction of the maximum score as those applied by Trichopoulou et al. [2] in the most commonly used scoring system with the maximum of nine points.  The associations between the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and mortality outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazard models with Mediterranean diet score (MDS) as both a categorical and a continuous variable. In the latter case, the associations of mortality risk with 1 SD increase in the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) were calculated. One SD in the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) was equal to 2.2 points in the pooled sample. Proportionality assumptions were tested with Schoenfeld residuals.",1a96bbaa-0561-4305-b8de-c5802a942148
10,analysis1," The proportion of deaths which could be prevented if participants in the lowest two Mediterranean diet score (MDS) categories increased their adherence to the Mediterranean diet one category upwards was calculated using a formula applied in previous studies [19] and modified for three exposure categories. Since the dietary assessment methods in the three cohorts were very similar and there was no interaction between Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and cohort, sex or smoking status, the associations of Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with mortality were estimated in the pooled sample (but cohort-specific results are presented in supplementary material).",4ef85315-d72f-4598-a7eb-dd25c7d43721

In order to assess the impact of the individual components to the overall Mediterranean diet score (MDS), the associations between the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) component scores and mortality outcomes were also calculated.",fa915091-5cb3-4761-bc7b-0d7916914cd8

13,results0,"Mediterranean diet score (MDS) components The proportions of participants in the three cohorts who scored the maximum points for the various Mediterranean diet score (MDS) components are shown in Table 1. While high proportion of participants scored maximum points for cereal intake in all three country cohorts, less than 25 % of all subject reached this “ideal intake” category regarding meat and alcohol intake and olive oil usage. Adequate intake of fruits and nuts and olive oil was especially rare among Russians. Although the proportion of participants with adequate vegetable, fruit and nut and meat consumption was higher in females than males, for all other Mediterranean diet score (MDS) components, maximum score was more common in males.

Cox regression results The simple and multivariable-adjusted associations of Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with total and cause-specific mortality outcomes in the pooled sample are shown in Table 3. In the multivariable-adjusted models, 1 SD (which equals to 2.2 points) increase in the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) was significantly associated with reduced risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) deaths even if all possible confounders were taken into account.

17,results7," When the age- and sex-adjusted mortality differences between the Polish and Russian cohorts (the two cohorts with the highest and lowest adherence to the Mediterranean diet) were further adjusted for the Mediterranean diet score (MDS), HRs for total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality rates reduced by 17.9 and 14.5 %, respectively (data not shown).  We also examined the relationship between the original Mediterranean diet score (MDS) based on sex-specific median cut-offs for component scores [2] and mortality outcomes (Table S2 in Online Resource). The results suggested somewhat weaker associations. The agreement between the two scores was moderate: Spearman’s correlation coefficient was 0.69, and the linear weighted kappa between the three Mediterranean diet score (MDS) categories in each score was 0.50.  When the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) components were examined separately, mortality risks showed inverse tendencies with all components except for meat and olive oil (Table 4).",4bf70bcc-4293-4b9e-b850-544da50e70f1
18,discussion0,"Main findings This study in three large urban population samples in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union found statistically significant inverse associations between Mediterranean diet score and total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Using a Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with absolute cut-off values for component scores, we also found that high adherence to Mediterranean diet, an indicator of healthy eating habits, in this Eastern European sample was rare.  Limitations and strengths of the study Several limitations need to be taken into account when the results are interpreted. First, the moderate response rates and the fact that cohorts were restricted to urban settings limit the generalizability of our findings and introduce selection bias. Although mortality rates in the three country cohorts were similar to national-level data [21], dietary habits of the study samples might differ from the Czech, Polish and Russian general populations.",45d648a4-04b1-474f-bae1-cf2afb1fc533
19,discussion1," For example, previous study suggests that inadequate fruit and vegetable intake is probably more common in rural FSU populations than in those who live in cities [22]. The lack of national representativeness, however, does not affect the internal validity of the findings regarding the association between Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and mortality.  The second limitation of the study is related to measurement error of dietary intakes and the disadvantages of FFQ [23, 24]. It is likely that the consumption of some foods was over- (i.e. fruits and nuts, vegetables) or underestimated (i.e. alcohol); consequently, the estimated Mediterranean diet score (MDS) of participants may be imprecise. However, this issue is common to the majority of nutritional epidemiological studies which use an FFQ for dietary assessment.",4985b8cc-4b46-4ab6-b87b-422e733772c2
20,discussion2," The relative validity of FFQ data in Health Alcohol and Psychosocial factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) study regarding the intakes of fruits, vegetables and selected micronutrients has been assessed previously using plasma biomarkers, indicating satisfactory correlations [13].  Finally, due to differences in the composition of food groups, food preparation techniques and meal patterns, Mediterranean diet score (MDS) might have important limitations in measuring the adherence to the exact Mediterranean-style diet in non-Mediterranean population samples [25]. These issues will need to be taken into account in future attempts to assess more precisely the extent to which the Mediterranean-style diet is followed by non-Mediterranean populations.  On the other hand, the prospective study design and the large sample size are important strengths of this analysis.",8246ad87-cadf-4514-b960-28d5c7709cf7
21,discussion3," No previous study on this scale has examined the association between Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and mortality in Central and Eastern Europe or the Former Soviet Union, and this is the first study that applied the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with absolute cut-offs, developed by Sofi et al. [10], for such assessment in any population.  Results in context The findings of this study are consistent with previous evidence which suggests that Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of cardiovascular (CVD) and total mortality [2, 5, 26]. Our results also indicate that the literature-based Mediterranean diet score (MDS) developed by Sofi and colleagues is a good indicator of healthy diet and predicts mortality outcomes well.",45ee62be-19c2-4311-8245-ab940802dc15
22,discussion4," In a previous analysis, we found that the healthy diet indicator (healthy diet indicator (HDI)), a diet quality score that measures the adherence to the World Health Organization’s dietary guidelines, also performed reasonably well in predicting cardiovascular (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in the same Health Alcohol and Psychosocial factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) cohorts [13]. While both analyses suggest that unhealthy diet is an important risk factor for cardiovascular (CVD) mortality in Eastern European populations, in contrast to healthy diet indicator (HDI), Mediterranean diet score (MDS) is a food-based score which makes the current results easier to translate into public health recommendations.",75607341-908d-467e-b0a6-de711c812250
23,discussion5," Previous analysis of the Polish arm of the Health Alcohol and Psychosocial factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) study also found lower risk of metabolic syndrome in individuals with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet [27], which suggests that the protective effect is at least partly mediated by the favourable metabolic profile.  The Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with absolute cut-offs appears to be suitable to assess the participants’ adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Although there have been earlier attempts to compile Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with absolute cut-offs [28, 29], no previous scoring systems have been constructed on such a sound evidence base as the one proposed by Sofi et al. [10].",db734ba5-4e51-4a48-ba1d-04c712df8249
24,discussion6," The fact that one quarter of the pooled study sample scored more than ten points (about 60 % of the maximum score) suggests that the adherence to the Mediterranean diet in the these Eastern European cohorts was low, and among the three cohorts, dietary habits of Russians were the furthest from this pattern. This is not unexpected; however, estimation of this Mediterranean diet score (MDS) in population samples from other countries or regions and comparison with our results is necessary to test the hypothesis that the adherence to Mediterranean diet in Eastern Europe is indeed lower than other populations.  Correlations between different versions of Mediterranean diet score (MDS) have been reported to be weak to moderate [30]. In this light, the moderate agreement between the “traditional” Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and the literature-based adherence score by Sofi et al.",43ce73ff-d3e7-451e-b8b1-59174ab050c6
25,discussion7,", found in our study, was satisfactory, given the different cut-off values of component scores and also the arbitrary thresholds of the low, moderate and high scoring categories. The differences might be also partly due to the component which differed between the two scores (olive oil usage vs. unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio). Most effect estimates were stronger with the version using absolute cut-offs. The larger variation between individual Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s, which is the result of the three-tier scoring system, is probably one of the primary reasons for this difference.  It has long been assumed that diet made important contribution to the high total and cardiovascular mortality in Eastern Europe, but it has been difficult to identify specific dietary factors responsible for this contribution.",92b53651-26f3-4d86-8313-9fa537f29bbf
26,discussion8," This study suggests that dietary patterns, as approximated by the Mediterranean diet score (MDS), are consistently associated with mortality outcomes and may well provide at least partial explanation for the contribution of nutrition to health status in the region.
