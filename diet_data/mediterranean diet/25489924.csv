0,background0,"In the past, it has been suggested that a reduction in mortality may be related to the type of alcoholic beverages consumed. Studies found lower mortality rates associated with wine drinking [1]. The relationship between wine and mortality has been described as a J-shaped curve, with a beneficial effect occurring from low daily wine consumption [2]. In their meta-analysis, Costanzo et al. were the first to establish the same J-shaped curve for beer as for wine [2]. A maximal protection is, on average, 31 % (95 % CI: 19–42 %) and is observed at 21 g/day of wine. Similarly, a J-shaped relationship was apparent for beer, producing a maximal protection of 42 % (95 % CI: 19–58 %) at 43 g/day of beer [2]. This reduced risk may be due to an increased high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) cholesterol fraction and/or by the antithrombotic effect of alcoholic beverages [2].",a3f626d3-ed90-4775-8a68-6868ad5446c0
1,background1,"  The early observed differential effect of wine compared to beer on mortality would indicate that components other than alcohol play a role in explaining the mortality differences associated with beer and wine. The antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of polyphenolic substances in wine have been proposed as an alternative mechanism [1]. However, recent research contradicted the specific effect of polyphenolic substances on mortality [3]. Thus, other characteristics not related to the specific components of beer and wine must play a role in the relationship between wine and mortality, thereby explaining the differential protective results of wine.  Few studies have been conducted relating the type of alcoholic beverage to dietary patterns.",1d6b06c4-cfdc-4201-83df-0ec2e1384234
2,background2," Dietary pattern analysis, based on the concept that the combination of foods eaten are as important as a reductive methodology characterized by a single food or nutrient analysis, emerged more than 10 years ago as an alternative approach for studying the relationship between nutrition and disease [4]. Two major methods are used to reduce complex dietary data: a hypothesis-oriented approach using prior information to stratify a dietary pattern and a statistical approach using study-specific data to rank individuals, i.e., principal component analysis or reduced rank regression models [4].  The Healthy Eating Index 2010 and the Mediterranean Diet Score are two international and frequently used hypothesis-oriented approaches. The Healthy Eating Index 2010 represents the degree to which a dietary pattern conforms to official guidelines summarized in the United States Department of Agriculture Food Guide Pyramid [5].",cf0ca8a8-4296-47d8-a4ae-e9ee800a08fb
3,background3," The Mediterranean Diet Score, according to the Mediterranean dietary pattern, has received much attention due to the associated reduction in mortality [6]. A statistical approach can also be used to derive a dietary pattern through principal components analysis.  The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between beer and wine consumption and dietary patterns. In the present study, three dietary patterns were characterized by the Healthy Eating Index 2010, the Mediterranean Diet Score and a pattern obtained by principal component analysis.

The selection consisted of 598 officers, 2103 non-commissioned officers and 2299 soldiers. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire with 150 food items was mailed to the participants to record consumption during the last year. The following categories of consumption frequency were used: never, one to three times a month, once a week, two to four times a week, five to six times a week, once a day, two to three times a day, four to six times a day and more than six times a day. Portion sizes were predefined using familiar measuring devices (such as teaspoons, glasses, and cups).

5,methods1," A glass of beer was converted to 250 ml, and a glass of wine was converted to 100 ml. Beer consumption was the sum of all types of beer consumed by an individual. Wine consumption was defined as the sum of red, white and rosé wine consumed by an individual. For the analyses, beer consumers were defined as participants for whom 60 % or more of their total alcohol consumption was beer and wine consumers were defined as participants for whom 60 % or more of their total alcohol consumption was wine.  A second questionnaire about physical activity based on validated translations of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) [8] was sent to the participants.

A third questionnaire was used to register health-related and lifestyle characteristics. This questionnaire was a more general questionnaire about smoking, age, weight, and height. This questionnaire was used in previous research [9].  Participation was on a voluntary basis and without incentives.

The Healthy Eating Index 2010 and the Mediterranean Diet Score were computed as described earlier [5, 6]. The possible scores for the Healthy Eating Index ranged from 0 to 100 and for the Mediterranean Diet Score from 0 to 9, with a higher score indicating a healthier pattern. Principal component analysis was applied to the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire data. First, 150 food items were classified into 34 predefined food groups with similar nutrient profiles, according to Hu et al. [4]. Principal components analysis was used to derive dietary patterns based on the 34 food groups.

The remaining factors were more similar after the fourth factor (ranging from 1.38 for the fifth factor to 1.10 for the tenth factor). Three major dietary patterns were clearly identified for further analysis. The factor scores for each pattern were constructed by summing up the observed intake of the component food items, weighted by the individual factor loadings. The factor scores rank individuals according to their agreement with each dietary pattern. The healthiest dietary pattern was selected, that is, the Healthy Dietary Pattern (principal components analysis), because a high factor score is associated with the healthiest pattern, which is also the case for the Healthy Eating Index and the Mediterranean Diet Score.",75067b1a-cdcf-45e2-8858-ad3b3e37a8ec

20,discussion0,"In the present study with a military population, daily beer consumption compared with wine is associated with a less healthy dietary pattern, as measured by three different methods, i.e., the healthy eating index 2010, the Mediterranean diet score and a pattern obtained by principal component analysis, and with less physical activity and a higher prevalence of smoking. This means that daily wine consumption is associated with a cluster of healthier lifestyle characteristics, which could influence the relationship between the type of alcoholic beverage consumed and mortality.  Our results are in agreement with other studies carried out in Denmark, the United States, and France [10–12]. Johansen et al. [10] found that Danish people who bought wine purchased a greater number of healthy food items than those who bought beer. Wine buyers bought more Mediterranean food items, and beer buyers bought more traditional Danish food items. Tjønneland et al.",6fd8c62e-dea6-46c3-aeaf-05dec3856b08

In the same study, wine intake was associated with not smoking and higher education. In a French study, Ruidavets et al. [12] found that wine consumption was also associated with a healthier diet, not smoking and a higher socioeconomic status.  A healthier lifestyle characterized by a higher intake of plant foods, lower intake of saturated fatty acids, and non-smoking has been shown to reduce the risk of premature mortality [13]. The differential relationship between wine and beer consumption and mortality detected by Renaud et al. [1] could be confounded by a healthier lifestyle associated with wine consumption. Studies relating wine to morbidity and mortality do not always fully adjust for dietary patterns.",8a1e4cd1-9f47-4112-9ed3-971873263b4a
22,discussion2," For example, a French prospective cohort study found that moderate wine consumption was associated with a lower risk of mortality compared with beer consumption [14]. The relative risk of mortality was adjusted for age, education, smoking, physical activity, serum cholesterol and Body Mass Index (BMI) but not for dietary patterns, which could explain the observed differential health effects between beer and wine [14].  The two hypothesis-oriented approaches, i.e., the healthy eating index 2010 and the Mediterranean Diet Score, have a different approach to determining alcohol consumption. In the healthy eating index 2010, calories from alcohol are considered to be empty calories, i.e., counted in the empty calorie component, but only when alcohol is consumed beyond moderate amounts.",62d91870-af15-4360-bd30-0ec1896d6506
23,discussion3," The least restrictive of the two levels defined as moderate drinking in the American Dietary Guidelines (two drinks per day; converted to 28 g of ethanol), was used to set the threshold for counting alcohol as empty calories. This method differs from that of the Mediterranean diet score in which alcoholic beverages result in one point when consuming alcoholic beverages in moderation, which represents 10 % of the total score. Abstainers and consumers of more than three glasses of alcoholic beverages per day are classified in the same categories with a score of zero for the alcoholic beverages component. It is important to note that this classification of alcoholic beverages in the dietary indices occurs independently of the type of alcohol consumed. The total explained variance by principal component analysis for the three dietary patterns in our study was only 21 %. However, this low percentage is in agreement with Slattery et al.

However, the main purpose of this study was not to provide exact estimations of prevalence but to detect differences in dietary patterns between participants based on the type of alcoholic beverages consumed. In their publication, Lorant et al. [17] found that less educated subjects were less likely to participate in a survey when they had a poor health status compared with better-off groups. This may lead to an underestimation of the relationship between alcoholic beverage consumption and dietary patterns. Another limitation of this study is the use of a food frequency questionnaire to register alcoholic beverage consumption. Working with predefined categories of consumption can limit choices for the participants, resulting in lower sensitivity.",21d0827c-d676-413b-b101-6db7dec2bc1c
