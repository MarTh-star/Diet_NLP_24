0,introduction0,"Social support is defined as the perception that one is accepted, cared for, has assistance available from other people, and that one is part of a supportive social network. It has a complex, multi-level character that involves voluntary associations as well as formal (healthcare professionals and organisations) and informal (family members, friends and peers) relationships with others. Moreover, it is perceived differently on the basis of the recipient's gender, racial or ethnic background, or cultural practices(1–4). Several behaviour change theories, such as the Social Cognitive Theory(5), the Theory of Planned Behaviour(6), the Social-Ecological Model(7) and the Health Action Process Approach(8), draw attention to the importance of social support and social connectedness in achieving and maintaining behaviour change.",f1f3f581-edf9-4086-8da6-acee2c378f9f
1,introduction1," There is a considerable amount of published research assessing the proposed associations between social support and aspects of physical and mental health such as dietary behaviours, physical activity, smoking, substance or alcohol use, chronic illness management, suicide or self-injury, cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) and cancer progression. However, in previous research, social support has not been deemed as a consistent predictor of dietary behaviours(9–11), while it appeared to have a moderate effect on exercise behaviours by indirectly improving engagement, compliance and adherence to physical activity(12). Moreover, whether social support is positively or negatively associated with health outcomes and health behaviours depends on the operationalisation of the construct.",0a02ec6f-c72d-4301-9a26-f142d3c95b10
2,introduction2," Perceived social support (prospective availability) and social network size usually show positive associations, while received social support (retrospective assessment of help received) is often found to relate negatively to health and health behaviours(13,14).  Non-communicable diseases, including diabetes and obesity, are a major challenge for health and development. Based on the present evidence, regular physical activity and Mediterranean diet have been proven to help prevent and treat non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, some cancers and cognitive impairment(15–18). It also helps to prevent hypertension, overweight and obesity and can improve mental health, quality of life and well-being(18).",e932d549-f029-4b38-b89e-4954543f291e
3,introduction3," Recently, there has been an overall aim of providing national and regional level policymakers with guidance on the frequency, duration, intensity, type and total amount of physical activity and the healthy diet needed for the prevention of non-communicable diseases(19,20).  In addition, online social networks have seen enormous growth in popularity in recent years, and yet, there are many uncertainties as to whether, and how, they might be harnessed to improve health behaviours also through the mediation of social support(21). Due to the radical shift in society involving digital technology, the conclusions from the pre-digital era need to be re-evaluated. Focusing on aspects of social support such as emotional support, financial support and social network ties, the aim of the present study was to examine whether there is an association between social support and adherence to a healthy Mediterranean diet and physical activity.

4,methods0,"Study design and participants This cross-sectional study used baseline data from the CREDITS4HEALTH (C4H) study, a parallel-group, multi-centre, randomised controlled community-based trial (randomised controlled community based trial (RCT)). The C4H study aimed to assess the effects of an online platform that supports people in enhancing their level of physical activity and adopting a healthy Mediterranean diet by means of a person-centred approach, providing personalised plans and suggestions along with psychological and social support(22).  Participants were adults, aged 18–65 years, in apparently good health, with the ability of regular internet access through technological devices (PC, tablet and smartphone), and residing in the Florence metropolitan area and the Salento region (Italy), Girona (Spain), and the Pylos Nestoras and Kalamata municipalities (Greece).",333e7547-bbda-457b-b3dc-f3e7a91104a5

During a baseline visit at the research centres, each participant answered questions related to social background, chronic diseases and pharmacological treatments. Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and body composition) and blood pressure measurements were recorded by trained staff in accordance with the C4H operations protocol. Participants were also invited to undergo blood testing at associated laboratories for the following parameters: total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, glucose, HbA1c and uric acid.",7407456c-0ef6-4d91-83a2-b4abec108209
6,methods2,"  Social support assessment Social support was evaluated using the social support questionnaire (social support questionnaire (SSQ)) of the 2005 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)), a seven-item, self-administered questionnaire assessing the perceived availability of social support and the individuals’ level of satisfaction with the support provided and received. The questions were selected from the Yale Health and Aging Study (MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging)(23) and the Social Network Index – Alameda County Study(24). It includes questions considering the availability of emotional support, the people providing emotional support (friends, spouse, children, co-workers, neighbours and other) as well as the level of received and desired emotional support(25) (Table 2).",96112dfb-ec63-4288-8692-16fc6ee6d2cf
7,methods3," It should be noted that currently, there is no perfect measure of social support, especially given that the lack of consensus regarding the definition and conceptualisation of social support, as well as the relative gap of strong psychometric evidence in the literature for many of the currently available measures. The social support questionnaire (SSQ) is easily accessible via the Internet, scoring is simple and the questionnaire is quite short, limiting the amount of time consumed to be filled in. Furthermore, the seven included questions are simply formed with comprehensive probes and examples to promote the level of understanding. A very important aspect of the social support questionnaire (SSQ) is the inclusion of questions evaluating social support provided by religious services (e.g. church) and tangible support (financial assistance, material goods or services).",d6a32547-9ed1-4195-b1aa-62af43f689b2
8,methods4,"  Physical activity and Mediterranean diet adherence assessment Physical activity levels were assessed using the General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ)), a seven-item screening tool developed by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine as a validated short measure of physical activity used to assess adult (16–74 years) physical activity levels. It includes questions about the type and amount of physical activity involved in one's occupation, hours spent on physical exercise, cycling, walking, housework/childcare and gardening/DIY, providing a four-level categorisation of respondents as active, moderately active, moderately inactive and inactive(26). Considering psychometric properties of the General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ), for reliability, 56 % (70/126) and 67 % (87/129) of controls scored the same at 3 and 12 months, respectively, as they scored at baseline.",668c7112-2d08-498f-9c65-71e22f80bae4
9,methods5," General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ) had 19 % (13/69) sensitivity and 85 % (186/220) specificity(27).  Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was evaluated using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)), adapted from a previously validated 14-item index(28) with higher scores indicating a healthier diet. Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) is a brief 14-item questionnaire which is less time-demanding, less expensive and requires less collaboration from participants than the usual full-length questionnaires or other more comprehensive methods. In addition, it provides the unique window of opportunity to provide feedback to the participant immediately after the questionnaire is completed(29,30).",f1f91654-37a2-4bf6-a359-5c2708086089

To facilitate data analyses, the number of close friends was re-coded into four categories to identify distinct sizes of network: 0; 1–4; 5–9 and 10 or more close friends, and church attendance was re-coded as never, occasionally, weekly and more than weekly, categorisations previously used by McKenzie et al.(31). Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was re-coded to underweight, normal, overweight and obese based on the WHO classification(32). ",6e49c95e-0897-4e7a-896a-24a80036897e

23,discussion1,"  Comparison to previous studies With regards to the available research on the relationship between social support and physical activity, the available evidence is limited in size and in methodological rigour mainly comprised of cross-sectional studies(33,34). Overall, the evidence on adults is inconclusive ranging from positive associations in earlier studies(35) to no or unclear evidence(34,36–39). Most studies adopted a cross-sectional design, they involved mainly healthy participants, they focused on the social support provided by friends and family, while a combination of self-reported and objectively measured level of physical activity was used to assess physical activity.",b8ecaaa0-f702-4824-bf2c-48fc71151d80
24,discussion2," Interestingly, provision of social support has been related to small, but significant associations with physical activity in children and adolescents(34,40); cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown that social support provided by parents, father, mother, friends and relatives is positively and consistently related to higher physical activity levels in adolescents(40). Given that self-efficacy and competence mediate the relationship between social support and physical activity, it is possible that social support indirectly influences physical activity levels through self-efficacy and other possible mediating constructs (e.g. enjoyment). Moreover, it is likely that the ways in which parents and friends provide social support and influence activity levels are different.",ac065ddb-93f9-4405-b580-8aba63c78882
25,discussion3," For example, friends might contribute to positive experiences in physical education or organised physical activities, while parents could create a foundation for lifelong habits in physical activity in their children at an early age and provide support for their ongoing participation in physical activity during adolescence. Further research might investigate these possible mechanisms in more detail(40).  Similarly to our study which significantly associated Mediterranean diet adherence to emotional support availability and social network support, previous research on the associations between social support and diet showed that the inclusion of planning for social support/social change has been associated with enhanced effectiveness of dietary interventions, resulting in increases in fruit and vegetable intakes(9–11,41–43). Nevertheless, there is a lack of evidence considering the Mediterranean diet exclusively.",91f943d9-46b1-4139-a2e2-f206a27f730a
26,discussion4," Socialisation in the form of sitting around the table and sharing food in company of family and friends (conviviality), a form of social support, is considered an inherent aspect of Mediterranean diet lifestyle(44). Yet, the role of the Mediterranean diet as a holistic lifestyle pattern, and not exclusively as a healthier diet, needs further evaluation. Perhaps the relationship to health may exist for the overall Mediterranean diet as a healthy lifestyle pattern, and not necessarily for an isolated aspect of its components.  Strengths and limitations Strengths of the present study include its size and the inclusive sample of participants in apparent good health from multiple research centres in three Mediterranean countries, a population that has not been previously studied extensively in terms of associations between social support, Mediterranean diet adherence and physical activity.",d33e388f-dac9-4182-8dc5-52be9c354c6d
27,discussion5," Correspondingly, to our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to investigate religious services attendance in association with Mediterranean diet and physical activity among Mediterranean populations. Moreover, the present study represents one of the few efforts to investigate the relationship between social support and Mediterranean diet exclusively, as one of the well-established healthy dietary patterns.  The present study is also subject to certain limitations that should be considered. In cross-sectional studies, causal relationships cannot be established between physical activity and social support. Thus, it is not possible to rule out the presence of reverse causality in the results found, that is, people who received more social support are those who were already active.",5790f6e1-db6c-46bf-b284-fafd5ccd16a7
28,discussion6," The possibility that this relationship is bidirectional must also be considered, that is, that inactive people who receive social support also become more active or maintain their physical activity levels(41). Moreover, dietary data on Mediterranean diet are based on self-reports, which on top of the cross-sectional study design may limit the relevance of the conclusions. Another possible limitation is that the content validity of some questionnaire items might have been reduced due to the translation of items into Italian, Spanish and Greek. However, all questionnaires were translated from English to all study languages and were checked by bilingual native speakers to ensure that the items correctly captured each construct. Moreover, another limitation of the present study is related to the secondary analyses.",528e5f7e-17b1-4062-bc4a-f2215accc2c3

30,discussion8," Social support has been measured using various tools; however, in many cases, these scales were modified for use, or authors use non-validated, custom scales to measure social support. There is a wide number of measures used to appraise social integration or support in the general population or specific patient groups (e.g. arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes)(41). Nonetheless, currently, there is no perfect measure of social support, given the lack of consensus regarding the definition and conceptualisation of social support, as well as the relative gap of strong psychometric evidence in the literature for many of the available measures(45). This is problematic because this lack of consistency could lead to imprecise measurement, which has been previously recognised as a challenge(40).",f21e3723-aee8-4bf1-bcfb-33039366b348
31,discussion9,"  Implications for future research and practice Further research is needed to investigate the effects of social support on physical activity and Mediterranean diet adherence including valid measures of social support and its individual components and detailed reporting of potential effect modifiers such as conviviality. Future research should also include the assessment of interventions targeting social support and their impact on the adoption of a healthier lifestyle. Furthermore, while the present study found no association between religious service attendance and Mediterranean diet adherence or physical activity, different religious beliefs and practices may have a different impact on health-related behaviours; the identification of specific factors contributing to the effect of religious participation on health behaviours requires further investigation. Finally, the emergence of digital social networking is quickly altering traditional social contacts.",15a88cad-f0ce-4844-b289-c96d36c936b0
32,discussion10," Further research is needed to investigate the potential of digital social networking in altering the effect of social support on health behaviours.  Nowadays, the promotion of healthy diet, healthy weight control and physical activity maintenance are considered key parts in forming a sustainable public health policy toward better population health and the prevention of diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Recognising potential social support mediators for use in evidence-based interventions is a crucial step in the improvement of the interventions aiming to encourage individuals and families in making dietary and physical activity choices that may meaningfully improve the health of present and future generations.  Conclusions Our findings suggest that emotional support availability and number of close friends may be positively associated with Mediterranean diet adherence.",f6b06144-ef60-4ecb-ac98-6342d627242c
33,discussion11," However, traditional social contacts may not be strongly associated neither with physical activity, nor with healthy diet adherence. The potential of digital technologies in altering the effect of social support on health behaviours needs further investigation. To that end, the further conceptualisation of social support and development of valid and up to date social support measures are needed.
