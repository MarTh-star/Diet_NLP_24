0,background0," The American Heart Association recommends Life’s Simple 7 as ideal cardiovascular health (ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH)) to reduce cardiovascular risk. Rate advancement period (Rate advancement period (RAP)), a useful tool to quantify and communicate exposure impact on risks, may enhance communication about the benefits of achieving ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH). We aimed to examine whether greater adherence to ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH) metrics was associated with reduced incidence of cardiovascular risk in a population-based cohort and estimate its impact on the timing of occurrence using Rate advancement period (RAP).

1,methods0," The present study is embedded in the Vascular Risk in Navarra (Risk in Navarra Study (RIVANA)) Project, a Mediterranean population-based cohort designed to assess the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and their association with Cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Details of the study design and procedures have been described elsewhere [22, 23]. Briefly, a total sample of 6553 individuals aged 35–84 years was randomly selected from the population register of the Autonomous Community of Navarre, Spain. The sample was stratified by sex and age to be representative of the Navarre population. Individuals who were institutionalized, living in Autonomous Communities other than Navarre, had died, and did not respond after multiple contacts were excluded from the initial sample.",cf3e40a1-87e6-49d6-a305-52293cfbf4ce
2,methods1," The logistics of the study implied the deliberate exclusion of institutionalized individuals and people living temporarily in Autonomous Communities other than Navarre when the study was carried out [22]. After inclusion/exclusion criteria, 5682 individuals were invited through mail, phone calls, and home visits from June 2004 to December 2005 to participate in the study cohort. Of these, 4168 individuals agreed to enroll in the cohort (response rate 73.4%) and were followed up until December 2017.  The study protocol was approved by The Institutional Review Board of the Government of Navarre (approval code PI_2004/4). All participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study and additional access to their medical records.",318ef12c-7eb9-4b6d-90dc-0fd4359d92e0
3,methods2,"  For the present analyses, we excluded participants with prevalent Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral arterial disease) at baseline (n = 333), those with missing values for health metrics (n = 4), and those who were lost to follow-up (n = 5), with an overall retention > 99%.  Assessment of the cardiovascular health score and covariates  Participants that agreed to enroll in the cohort were contacted from one of the 25 participating primary healthcare centers. Trained nurses collected via face-to-face structured interviews participants’ self-reported socio-demographic and lifestyle information, including smoking habit, physical activity, adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), individual and family medical history, and current medication use. The pharmacist and physician team members reviewed the participants’ medication for each condition and resolved with nurses any potential misclassification or conflict.",c8f565ee-8f54-46e7-a20c-7d22b0b0a50e
4,methods3," Adherence to the MedDiet was measured using a previously validated 14-item questionnaire [24, 25]. Physical activity levels were assessed using the validated Spanish version of the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire [26, 27]. Metabolic equivalent hours per week (METs-h/week) were calculated based on time spent and intensity required for each performed activity according to the international compendium of physical activity [28]. Anthropometric measures were conducted in duplicate by registered nurses using standardized techniques. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate using a validated semiautomatic oscillometer (OMRON® M4-1). Finally, laboratory test analyses were conducted to determine biological parameters, including fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, among others [22, 23].",8b491baa-c453-4811-9554-1d058d3c50ca
5,methods4,"  Our ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH) score was based on 7 equally weighted health metrics as proposed by the American Heart Association (AHA) [6]. We assigned 1 point for each of the following health metrics that participants met at baseline: never-smoker or quitting > 12 months ago, ≥ 9 points of adherence to MedDiet, ≥ 150 min/week of moderate physical activity or ≥ 75 min/week of vigorous intensity or an equivalent combination, BMI < 25 kg/m2, untreated total cholesterol < 200 mg/dl, untreated blood pressure < 120/80 mmHg, and untreated fasting glucose < 100 mg/dl. Physical activity at “goal” was defined based on the World Health Organization recommendations [29], which is considered to be the equivalent of ≥ 500 METs-min/week based on the Compendium of Physical Activities (using a value of 3.3 METs, the level associated with a brisk [3 miles per hour] walking pace) [30].",0e9fe937-ec34-4fe7-ac6a-ed133f4a6a88
6,methods5," This ≥ 500 METs-min/week cut-off was also used in previous publications to define physical activity guidelines [19, 31]. The MedDiet was selected as dietary pattern that ‘promotes cardiovascular health’ due to the large, robust, and consistent evidence of its cardiovascular beneficial effects [32, 33]. The ≥ 9 cut-point score was selected based on the definition of good adherence provided by previous MedDiet studies [34, 35]. Thus, the total ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH) score ranged from 0 (worst) to 7 (best) points. Participants were categorized into 4 groups according to the number of achieved metrics (0–2, 3, 4, and 5–7) to ensure an adequate distribution of the sample in each score group. The upper and lower extremes of the ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH) score range were collapsed due to the low proportion of participants with these numbers of metrics.",03bb0ff9-2319-4f96-85e5-e875c88e4f6c
7,methods6,"  Outcome assessment  The primary endpoint of the study was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes  (all major cardiovascular events). The secondary endpoints were the individual components of the main composite endpoint and an expanded composite of major cardiovascular events that additionally included other ischemic heart diseases, other cerebrovascular diseases, and peripheral arterial disease. Definitions of study endpoints are described in Additional file 1: Fig. S1. For the ascertainment of cardiovascular events, several sources of information were used: primary electronic health record database, hospital discharge database, population based myocardial infarction registry, and regional and national mortality registries (managed by the National Statistical Institute, Madrid, Spain), which provided information on date and cause of death.",57a5a6f7-07af-40d8-a2bb-86f0326f57f7
8,methods7," Nearly all the 650,000 inhabitants of the community of Navarre are covered by the primary care electronic health record database, which has resulted to be a valid source for epidemiological surveillance in previous validation studies of disease diagnoses [36, 37]. To further identify potential cardiovascular events requiring hospitalization, we additionally reviewed the Assisted Morbidity Registry of Navarre, which involved the Minimum Basic Data Set with information of all public and private hospitals in the Navarre Health System. Record linkage additionally included the Regional Registry of Myocardial Infarction of Navarre and the National Statistics Institute of Spain. The combination of 4 sources of information and the utilization of primary electronic health records assured the study to have a strict follow-up of vital status of participants (< 1% losses). Medical records were reviewed by members of the study team.",1353f461-ce99-4514-a779-c83a88c9f30d

10,analysis0," Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the distribution of the baseline characteristics of the study population across groups of the ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH).  We used Nelson-Aalen estimators, adjusted for potential confounders with inverse probability weighting [38], to describe the incidence of the study’s endpoints over follow-up time across the 4 groups, and the differences between the groups were tested using the log-rank test.  Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of risk of developing cardiovascular events during follow-up. We considered the lowest score group (0–2 metrics) as the reference category. Time on study was the interval between the date of completion of the baseline interview and the date of diagnosis of cardiovascular events, or the date of death, whichever occurred first and the last recorded follow-up for non-cases.",cb936893-cfef-4b6d-8bb9-3afa48873d40
11,analysis1," Follow-up of participants without cardiovascular events exceeding the end of follow-up date (31 December 2017) was censored at this date. After crude models, we fitted age and sex-adjusted models, and multivariable models additionally adjusted for higher level of attained education (primary or less, secondary, and college/university), and occupation (executives/managers, clerical workers, and manual workers).  Tests of linear trend across successive categories of the ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH) score were calculated by assigning the median value to each category treating the resulting variables as continuous. The potential non-linear relationship between ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH) metrics and the primary endpoint was graphically examined using fully adjusted restricted cubic splines with three knots. A p-value for non-linearity was calculated by the likelihood ratio test [39].",4980e0ed-274b-43d7-9616-5962c3110190
12,analysis2,"  Rate advancement period (RAP)s for the study endpoints were calculated according to Brenner et al. [13]. In our study, Rate advancement period (RAP)s represent the equivalent risk associated with ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH) metric in terms of years of chronological age. Thus, Rate advancement period (RAP)s represent the baseline age difference at which exposed subjects (participants with > 2 metrics) reach the same risk of disease (endpoint events) as unexposed subjects (participants with ≤ 2 metrics). Point estimates of Rate advancement period (RAP)s and 95% CIs were derived from multivariate Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for the same potential confounders. We verified the proportionality of hazard assumption graphically and conducting Schoenfeld residuals to correctly interpret Rate advancement period (RAP) estimates [14, 40].  The association of each individual health metric with the risk of developing major cardiovascular events was additionally calculated.",90425be1-98c7-4a08-ae18-c535ae68009c
13,analysis3," Cox models were fitted for each health metric of the score adjusting the models for the effect of the other metrics and the same confounders as previous models. The reference category for each independent analysis was not meeting the criterion (0 points).  Sensitivity analyses were also conducted using additional adjustments: alcohol consumption (never [0 g/day]; light [< 5 g/day]; moderate [women: 5–15 g/day and men 5–30 g/day]; heavy [women: > 15 g/day and men > 30 g/day]), and serum concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (continuous). We additionally explored the association between individual health metrics and the primary endpoint of the study by removing from the models the adjustments of the effect of the other metrics.  All statistical tests were conducted using STATA version 16 (StataCorp LP), and statistical significance was set at 2-tailed p < .05. ",524351a2-8c21-4436-a000-d7ce92d8a778
14,results0," A total of 3826 participants (mean [SD] age, 52.8 [12.8] years; 2137 [55.9%] female) were included for the present analyses. During a median of 12.8 years (interquartile range 12.3 to 13.1) of follow-up, a total of 194 primary endpoints (major cardiovascular events) were identified. For secondary endpoints, we identified 67 myocardial infarction events, 87 stroke events, 66 deaths from cardiovascular causes, and 292 cases of the expanded composite of major cardiovascular events. The distribution of the study participants by baseline characteristics according to the number of ideal metrics is summarized in Table 1. Participants’ values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, LDL- and total cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, and BMI monotonically decreased as the number of metrics increased, whereas HDL-cholesterol values and MedDiet adherence score gradually increased (Table 1).",80ed280c-243f-4582-89c8-a8b5bf429688

Higher number of ideal metrics was also associated with a significantly lower risk of infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, and an expanded composite of major cardiovascular events. The relative risk reduction for participants in the healthiest category (5–7 metrics) compared to participants in the unhealthiest (0–2 metrics) was 68% for risk of major cardiovascular risk events, and 68%, 71%, 81%, and 69% for myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, and the expanded composite of major cardiovascular events, respectively.",ddf5c16e-0e61-4890-a209-fe16e43923b0

Noteworthy, a large proportion of participants of our study met the metric for physical activity, which is consistent with the fact that inhabitants of the Autonomous Community of Navarre show one of the highest levels of physical activity throughout Spain [42]. Observing the large proportion of participants who met the metric for physical activity and healthy diet (56.2%), a higher proportion of participants achieving the metrics for blood pressure and total cholesterol might be expected.",44af6c44-3af1-4b40-a08b-066ba3c366a0
27,discussion3," Potential explanations for these findings may rely on reverse causality—participants may improve their quality diet and physical activity levels in response to the diagnosis of some risk factors such as elevated blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels.  Our findings are in line with previous studies conducted in the last few years across different countries that have suggested the health benefits of adhering to ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH) metrics [9, 43]. Significant reductions in cardiovascular risk have been reported as individuals meet a higher number of ideal metrics, observing a relative risk reduction greater than 60% in the majority of studies for adults who meet 6 or 7 metrics compared to individuals with 0 to 2 metrics. In Spain, only the aforementioned study conducted in the PREDIMED trial has examined the association of the 7 ideal metrics with cardiovascular risk [19].",378d2cb7-24ee-424d-8c6b-14de2ec6097f

Despite in our study the relative risk reduction was smaller than the one observed in the PREDIMED (39% vs. 64% when compared participants who achieved ≥ 4 metrics with participants in the lowest category), our findings additionally support the benefits of adhering to ideal metrics for the general population at low or medium cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, around 50% of the adult population of our cohort did not meet 4 health metrics, which highlights the potential impact of health promotion programs aimed to improve cardiovascular health behaviors and factors.  In our study, we additionally observed an inverse association between the risk of major cardiovascular events and individual metrics of the score.",8502d1fb-82d3-4cdf-9caf-0821f4f43af7
29,discussion5," None of the individual metrics, however, showed a greater protective effect than their total combination. These findings highlight the need to reinforce a direct message to the population about the importance of cardiovascular prevention from a multidimensional approach. Adhering to as many healthy cardiovascular habits as possible, instead of focusing on just one or of a few metrics, should be the public health message to deliver.  In the context of risk communication, Rate advancement period (RAP)s may represent a more comprehensible approach than classical risk estimates for the general population to understand the impact of the benefits of adhering to ideal metrics. Individuals generally expect to be informed about certain risk in a simple and understandable manner so that they can decide whether to change their behavior [44]. Moreover, health messages need to be relevant to the population at risk to capture their attention and increase risk perception.",0b8f8d08-188d-4138-8f12-f87ff6480e41
30,discussion6," Rate advancement period (RAP) represents the risk associated with ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH) in respect to the timing of occurrence of cardiovascular events. As such, our findings estimated that a 60-year-old adult who met ≤ 2 health metrics would experience the same risk of major cardiovascular events as a 74-year-old adult who met ≥ 5 metrics. This advancement (years of excess risk) may result in a simpler and more straightforward message to the general population. When individuals understand the risk of certain health factors and the potential benefits or prevention, shared decision-making may be more likely to occur and may consequently lead to behavioral change [10].  Limitations and strengths  This study has several limitations. First, ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH) metric information was assessed at baseline, and it may be possible that participants might have changed their metrics over follow-up.",4e4e1b70-7370-40b6-bbef-f49969820cb7

Third, the number of study endpoints in our cohort was limited, particularly secondary endpoints, which may have attenuated the statistical power of our results; nevertheless, previous findings of the Risk in Navarra Study (RIVANA) cohort on Cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been reliable [23]. And fourth, it may be possible that certain lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity, diet, or smoking may be greatly rooted in a country’s culture; yet, it seems plausible the observed findings can be generalized to other populations.",e8c6f65c-d47f-4e5c-868b-d935e2903d52
32,discussion8," Despite these limitations, the strengths of our study are reflected in the population-based nature of the cohort, the rigorous method of collection of cardiovascular events supported by public resources and validated electronic health record database [36, 37], the long follow-up, the high retention proportion, and the inclusion of sensitivity analyses.  Conclusions  The results of our study suggest a substantially lower risk of major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, and the expanded composite of major cardiovascular events when adhering to ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH). Rate advancement period (RAP)s demonstrated the potential for prevention by adhering to health metrics. We additionally found that the combined effects of the ideal cardiovascular health (ICVH) metrics led to a lower risk reduction than the individual effect of any metric.",5bb3a0f7-20d9-42ea-b054-b14ee4cb52f9
