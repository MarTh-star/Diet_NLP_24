0,methods0,2.1. Study Design A cross-sectional study was carried out among selected public and private university students in Lebanon. The top 10 universities in Lebanon were chosen based on the number of registered students according to the report by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education for the academic year of 2017-2018 [19].  2.2. Sampling Method Data from the Ministry of Education was used in order to calculate the number of students needed from the major universities in Lebanon to be a representative sample. Then university students were sent a link to a self-administered online questionnaire. The students had to be currently enrolled in the university and aged below 25 years. A total of 303 students completed the questionnaire and were within the set criteria after excluding incomplete questionnaires and students aged above 25 years (127 students).  2.3.,ed6ef91c-476b-4e1e-b5df-543a081b612a
1,methods1," Ethical Considerations The questionnaire used in this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Holy Spirit University of Kaslik (University of Kaslik (USEK)). A consent form was written at the beginning of the questionnaire for all participants to read and agree to before filling out the questionnaire.  2.4. Questionnaire The questionnaire was composed of 38 questions divided into 5 main sections.  2.4.1. Section 1 This section included questions related to sociodemographic factors and academic achievement, namely gender, age, university, major, level of education, most recent cumulative Grade Point Average (Grade Point Average (GPA)), area of residence, living status, working status, and average monthly income.  Students were considered having excellent academic performance if their most recent Grade Point Average (GPA) score was higher than 3.67 (or higher than 85), good performance if Grade Point Average (GPA) was between 2.67 and 3.",ad0ac286-1874-4102-8426-e869aa49351d
2,methods2,"67 (or between 76 and 85), average performance if Grade Point Average (GPA) between 1.67 and 2.67 (or between 65 and 75), and poor performance if lower than 1.67 (or lower than 65) [20].  2.4.2. Section 2 In this section of the questionnaire, the students self-administered their weight in kilograms and height in meter and, subsequently, the Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms (kg) by the square of height in meters (m). The Body Mass Index (BMI) was evaluated according to standards put by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)), where a person is considered overweight if Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 and obese if Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 [21]. In addition, the participants were asked to choose from a variety of body pictures for males and females in order to assume their approximate waist/hip ratio.  2.4.3.",70c7f1b3-3021-4a39-b0b0-b39ca93f749b
3,methods3," Section 3 This section of the questionnaire included 4 multiple choice nutritional knowledge questions regarding choosing the healthiest breakfast choice, why it is recommended to have a healthy breakfast, the composition of a healthy meal, and the main components of the MD.  2.4.4. Section 4 In this part of the questionnaire, the subjects were asked about their dietary habits. The questions were if and what meals are usually skipped, how often breakfast is consumed, and reasons why one might consume or skip breakfast.  2.4.5. Section 5 In the final part of the questionnaire, the adherence to the MD was evaluated using the KIDMED test. It is based on a self-administered 16-question test with scores ranging from 0 to 12. Answers with a negative connotation are given a score of −1, and answers with a positive connotation are given a score of +1.",0b5fc465-daf1-4955-8399-59f67e147c95
4,methods4," Individual scores are added and those having ≥8 are said to have high adherence to the MD, 4–7 medium adherence, and ≤3 low adherence, and therefore, low diet quality [22].  2.5. Statistical Analysis All tests performed were evaluated using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)) for Windows version 25 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Qualitative data were described using the number and percent. The associations were calculated on a 95% confidence interval and the significance value to measure the strength of evidence was set at p < 0.05.  3. Results 3.1. Population Characteristics Of the 303 participants who completed the questionnaire, 210 were females and 93 were males. The majority of the females (56.5%) and males (62.6%) were aged between 21 and 25 years. 58.1% of females and 62.4% of males were undergraduates, and 70.",8301729e-f16a-42cf-a7b8-830f162cfde9
5,methods5,"5% of females were unemployed, either currently looking for work or not similar to 69.9% of males. 106 of the participants were students in the Lebanese university, while 197 were in private universities. There was a significant difference (p = 0.007) between females and males regarding Grade Point Average (GPA) scores where 81.5% of females had excellent (26.2%) and good performance (55.3%) compared to 63.4% of males with 20.4% having excellent performance and 43.0% having a good performance.  3.2. Anthropometric Measurements The average calculated Body Mass Index (BMI) of females was 22.96 kg/m2 ± 3.68 which was significantly lower (p = 0.0001) than the average Body Mass Index (BMI) of males which was 25.59 kg/m2 ± 4.59. There was a significant difference (p = 0.029) between the average Body Mass Index (BMI) of undergraduates (24.29 kg/m2 ± 4.26) and graduates 22.86 kg/m2 ± 3.55.

Regarding the knowledge questions, there was a significant difference (p = 0.0001) in the average Body Mass Index (BMI) on answers to the third question regarding components of a healthy meal. Students with correct answers had an average Body Mass Index (BMI) of 22.28 kg/m2 ± 3.14 compared to 24.31 kg/m2 ± 4.34 of those with false answers. There was also a significant difference (p = 0.0001) in the average Body Mass Index (BMI) between correct answers (21.37 kg/m2 ± 2.94) and false answers (24.16 kg/m2 ± 4.19) on the fourth question regarding knowledge about the characteristics of the MD.  3.3. Dietary Habits and Adherence to the MD The vast majority (79.20%) of the students reported that they always or sometimes skip a meal per day, with breakfast reported to be the most skipped meal. Only 38.",475583bb-ffbb-4213-98dc-320d4dd139dd
7,methods7,"28% of the students reported having breakfast every day. When students who sometimes (<7 days/week) or always (0 days/week) skipped breakfast were asked the reason behind not consuming breakfast, the main answer was the lack of time (25.31%) followed by oversleeping (20.04%) and lack of appetite (18.78%). The students who always (7 days/week) or sometimes (<7 days/week) consume breakfast reported that the main reason behind consuming breakfast was to gain energy (30.11%) followed by waking up hungry (26.47%) and to be healthy (20.13%).  Regarding the adherence to the MD, 32.70% of the students had a poor adherence scoring ≤3 on the KIDMED test, 48.50% had an average adherence scoring between 4 and 7, while 18.50% had a high adherence scoring ≥8. As shown in Table 1, there is a significant difference (p < 0.0001) between skipping meals and adherence to the MD where the vast majority of students who were with poor adherence to the MD reported to sometimes or always skip a meal (90.",27265841-855a-4acf-aecd-165a61a7f0fe

In the poor adherence to the MD category, only 15.15% of students reported consuming breakfast on a regular basis compared to 71.93% of students who have a high adherence.   Table 2 shows the difference in the average KIDMED score between correct and false answers on the nutritional knowledge questions. There was a significant difference between the average KIDMED scores between correct and false answers on the question related to choosing the healthiest breakfast option, components of a healthy meal, and characteristics of the MD, where in the 3 questions, those with correct answers had a higher average score on the KIDMED test compared to false answers.   Table 1 also shows that there is a significant difference in academic achievement when comparing the students' adherence to the MD. Only 17.",1fed60c7-538c-4fec-8aa0-da308b7f9829
9,methods9,"17% of students with poor adherence to the MD had excellent Grade Point Average (GPA) scores compared to 45.61% of excellent Grade Point Average (GPA) scores in the high adherence to the MD group. To further investigate the relation between Grade Point Average (GPA) scores and adherence to the MD, only the poor and high adherence to the MD was taken into consideration.  Figure 1 shows the average of the KIDMED scores compared to the academic performance represented by Grade Point Average (GPA) categories of students with poor adherence to the MD compared to those with high adherence. There is a significant difference between the groups (p = 0.002), where students with excellent performance had an average of 6.10 ± 3.666, good performance an average of 3.73 ± 3.365, satisfactory performance average of 3.56 ± 3.342, and poor performance an average of 2.80 ± 3.114.  4.",f1753518-541d-4e44-9a2c-40374347fb68
10,methods10," Discussion Since the university is considered the last step to engrave mass awareness including nutrition, to a large number of people, good nutrition awareness is needed in order to ensure healthy choices and behaviors in the coming generations. For this reason, this study was done in order to evaluate the level of adherence of university students in Lebanon to the MD and its association with sociodemographic, nutritional knowledge, eating behaviors, and academic achievement.  Similar to a study done among university students in Lebanon in 2014, our study found that males had a higher average Body Mass Index (BMI) than females. The previous study recruited 3384 students from private and public universities and found that a higher percentage of males were overweight or obese due to the fact that they were more prone to choose a westernized diet than females [13].",68360cea-1bcb-4725-806e-93fcb7c7d4d6
11,methods11," When comparing both genders as regards to Grade Point Average (GPA) scores, females seem to have higher Grade Point Average (GPA) scores than males. In this study, the Grade Point Average (GPA) scores were self-administered and may be prone to bias. In a study done among undergraduate university students in the United States, a significant difference between genders was found within the lower academic performance group; females in the study tended to overreport their actual Grade Point Average (GPA) while males underreport their actual Grade Point Average (GPA) scores [23].  In this study, students with lower average Body Mass Index (BMI) had significantly more correct answers on the nutritional knowledge questions than those with higher average Body Mass Index (BMI). In addition to the association between nutritional knowledge and lower Body Mass Index (BMI), an association was found between higher adherence to the MD and higher nutritional knowledge.",d1bbc863-a89a-4133-8e35-5db4222600d8
12,methods12," These results are consistent with a study done in Italy, which stated that the higher the nutritional knowledge a person has may lead to healthier food choices in addition to reduced rates of obesity [24]. This is an important indicator of the importance of nutrition awareness, especially when it comes to highlighting the importance of the MD and its various health benefits among university students. This will help them have healthier choices and may lead to improved health behaviors.  When students were asked what the most skipped meal was, breakfast was their first choice. The choice for breakfast being the most skipped meal by university students is consistent with studies done in Kuala Lumpur [25] and Turkey [16]. In both of these studies, the most common reason behind skipping breakfast was the lack of time, which was also the major reason in this study. This raises a question regarding the schedule of university students, which is sometimes hectic.",02c6d81a-8d33-44a5-9ce4-41e82af47781
13,methods13," Therefore, awareness should be focused on time-management in relation to meal planning. Regarding the reason behind consuming breakfast, the most common answer was to gain energy, which is also consistent with a study done in Egypt with gaining energy in the morning being the primary reason by university students to consume breakfast [26].  This study found a significant association between breakfast consumption and skipping meals with adherence to the MD. This association was established after a previous study done among Lebanese adolescents found that students who tend to skip breakfast had low adherence to the MD compared to students with regular breakfast consumption who all had high adherence [14]. Their study also concluded that not only consuming breakfast is associated with adherence to the MD, but the quality of food eaten at breakfast was also a strong predictor of the adherence to the MD.  Regarding the adherence to the MD, only 18.",c1ad2ab0-6f70-494d-b5f7-3e961f64c987
14,methods14,"5% of the students had a high adherence to the MD based on the KIDMED score. When comparing the results to studies done abroad, the numbers in this study are consistent with the study done in Turkey among university students where 17.8% of students had high adherence to the MD [16], but are different than the study done among the university students in Cyprus where 26.9% had high adherence [17]. Although to our knowledge, no previous study was done in Lebanon to evaluate the level of adherence to the MD among university students, the adherence was evaluated among Lebanese high school adolescents and similar to our study, only 15.8% of the participants had high adherence [14]. Since the numbers are consistent among different age groups, this seems to be a trend of shifting dietary habits and straying away from the traditional MD in Lebanon, which raises a concern regarding future dietary habits and choices.",20c4856f-a473-4318-aaee-0643f4b03fe1
15,methods15,"  This study found no difference in adherence to the MD between genders, although several previous studies, one of which was done in the Balearic Islands, found that adolescent boys had a higher risk of having low adherence to the MD than girls [27]. This was explained by the fact that girls are more interested in their body image than boys, but this association was not established in our study. However, other studies conducted in the Mediterranean area were in line with our findings and did not find significant differences between boys and girls [28], [29].  The most intriguing association found in this study was the relation between adherence to the MD and academic achievement. This study found that the higher the adherence to the MD, the higher the Grade Point Average (GPA) scores of the students. Although a causal association cannot be established given the nature of the study, nevertheless, this is an important finding.",252172ef-505b-472c-b4e8-59250e34b3ba
16,methods16," The study was done in Turkey also had similar results where the higher the adherence to the MD, the higher the Grade Point Average (GPA) scores [16]. In a review study published in 2017, it was found that in the majority of studies reviewed, there is a statistically significant positive association between dietary intake/behavior and academic achievement [30]. This can be a leading slogan when advertising for healthy eating, especially among university students, when they learn the importance of healthy eating, namely the MD, and its effect on health in general and its relation with higher Grade Point Average (GPA) scores.  Although to our knowledge, this is one of the first studies in Lebanon to evaluate the association between adherence to the MD and several factors among university students in Lebanon, few limitations cannot be excluded.",f3f27ac2-913c-4e79-a09e-3f7f72ec5763
17,methods17," One of which is that bias cannot be excluded especially since all the answers especially those regarding weight, height, and Grade Point Average (GPA) scores, are self-reported. In addition, a causal link cannot be established given the cross-sectional nature of the study and therefore, further cohort prospective studies need to be done to ensure if a causal link can be established between the variables. Selection bias cannot be excluded since a link to the online questionnaire was disseminated through students and university staff of personal knowledge and therefore, respondents may not represent the whole population of the university students in Lebanon.  5. Conclusion This study found that there is a significant association between adherence to the MD with nutritional knowledge and academic achievement; university students in Lebanon with higher adherence to the MD had higher nutritional knowledge and higher academic achievement. Only 18.8% of students had high adherence to the MD.",110d0fc3-1154-4ac6-874c-8470f677c3ec
18,methods18," In addition, breakfast was the most skipped meal, with the lack of time being the main reason. Our results are baseline due to the study's observational nature but open the floor to future nutrition interventions on the university level, which may be the last chance to engrave healthy eating behaviors on a large scale.
