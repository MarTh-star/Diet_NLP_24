0,introduction0,"Improvements in longevity have increased the likelihood for an individual to develop two or more diseases, a phenomenon commonly referred to as multimorbidity [1, 2]. Cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), including heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cancer are particularly relevant as they are the most common non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and represent major causes of morbidity, disability, and impaired quality of life [3]. Owing to improvements in health care, many individuals will survive their first NCD and multimorbidity is becoming the norm for people with chronic disease [4]. In 2016, there was an estimated 15.5 million cancer survivors living in the USA, of whom 60% of survivors aged 85 years and older had at least one comorbid condition prior to cancer and among the top three prevalent comorbid conditions were T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [5].",6f0c244c-d238-4356-8e7a-b3db013c5622
1,introduction1," In addition, data from Scotland have revealed that approximately 65% of individuals older than 65 years were multimorbid and more than half of all those with multimorbidity were younger than 65 years [4]. Multimorbidity is now considered a global health care priority [6].  The study of individual diseases dominates medical research, and epidemiological studies have generally investigated the occurrence of single adverse events as an outcome (e.g. incidence of cancer). This approach provides sound evidence for exposure-disease associations and has greatly advanced our understanding of disease aetiology [7]. The 2013–2020 World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs aimed to prevent and control major NCDs and their key risk factors including obesity, tobacco use, physical inactivity, harmful alcohol use, and unhealthy diets [8, 9].",f2dad822-1419-4d97-afb3-3a8219776cf6
2,introduction2," However, limited evidence exists on how established risk factors for single NCDs are related to clustering of NCDs within individuals. This evidence has the potential to broaden the scope of public health recommendations encompassing patients affected by chronic conditions, and to inform on combined interventions to prevent multiple NCDs. A recent randomized controlled trial showed that a multi-domain intervention reduced the risk of accumulating new chronic diseases most effectively in participants who already were affected by at least one chronic disorder at baseline [10]. However, few studies to date have investigated the association of lifestyle factors with multimorbidity [11–16], in particular in combination with cancer [11, 14, 15], and disease trajectories have not been studied.",37ef5ec5-6b62-4ddf-a81d-c41ce5f2b6c9
3,introduction3,"  The aim of this study was to investigate associations between five lifestyle factors and risk of cancer-cardiometabolic multimorbidity defined as developing subsequently at least two morbidities including first cancer at any site, cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in an individual. We also estimated 10-year absolute risks for these outcomes. ",f3eafe35-7efb-4bd7-b5a5-08b2bb25cc29
4,methods0,"Study population and design The European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study is an ongoing multi-centre cohort that was initiated from 1992 to 2000 in 23 recruitment centres across 10 European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the UK) and was designed to investigate the relationship between nutrition, lifestyle, genetics, and cancer and other chronic diseases [17]. More than 520,000 adults (70% women) mostly aged 35–70 were recruited and have been followed up for cancer events and mortality status.",cc5bd1af-009e-4c1e-9490-627af6d7dfc1
5,methods1," In addition, two nested cohort studies with a focus on T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD) were established which were used for outcome ascertainment in the current study: European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct is a case-cohort study that aimed to investigate the association between genetic and lifestyle factors and incident T2D events ascertained between 1992 and 2007 in all European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) countries with the exception of Norway and Greece [18].",3eef2e4b-55af-493e-b351-f294eed0980c
6,methods2," Similarly, European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the component of the European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study which investigated the aetiology of cardiovascular disease, with a case-cohort study design that assessed incident coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) and stroke events in European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) from 1992 to 2010 in all European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) countries except France [19].  Assessment of lifestyle exposure Diet, including alcohol intake, was assessed at baseline using validated country-specific or centre-specific dietary questionnaires designed to capture habitual consumption over the preceding year [17].",a802ec90-66e1-4940-bc87-74f26333d327
7,methods3," Information on smoking status and duration, educational attainment, menopausal status (women), and use of hormones in post-menopausal women was obtained using lifestyle questionnaires [17]. Height and weight (self-reported in the Oxford centre, measured elsewhere) were used to compute body mass index (body mass index (BMI), kg/m2) [17]. Physical activity was assessed at baseline using a specific questionnaire about occupational and recreational activity, from which a validated index (Cambridge Index) was computed to capture all physical activity domains [20]. Adherence to a healthy diet was assessed with the modified relative Mediterranean Diet Score (mrMDS), a variation of the original Mediterranean Diet Score replacing olive oil with vegetable oil [21].",ab99563d-c115-4d04-8805-38de9c827d51
8,methods4," The mrMDS is an 18-point linear score that incorporates 9 nutritional components of the Mediterranean diet, including components presumed to be beneficial (vegetables, legumes, fruit and nuts, cereals, fish and seafood, vegetable oil, and moderate alcohol consumption) and potentially harmful (meat and meat products and dairy products). Each mrMDS component was estimated in grams per 1000 kcal to express intake as energy density [21]. All components were divided into country-specific tertiles and scores 0 to 2 were summed up, with increasing scores for healthier diet (range 0–18).  Healthy lifestyle index The five lifestyle factors were summarized in a composite healthy lifestyle index (healthy lifestyle index (HLI)) as described previously [22]. Briefly, categories of each factor were scored from 0 to 4, with higher points indicating a healthier behaviour for, in turn, smoking (never smoked = 4, former smoker = 2, current smoker = 0), alcohol intake (< 6 g/day = 4, 6.0–11.",38ef4a81-bd37-4395-ac44-982d684d2ef5

The healthy lifestyle index (HLI) ranged from 0 to 20. We also computed a simplified version of the healthy lifestyle index (HLI) (shealthy lifestyle index (HLI)) by giving one point if the healthy definition of a lifestyle factor was met, according to healthy lifestyle recommendations, and 0 otherwise. The scoring of the shealthy lifestyle index (HLI) is shown in Additional file 1: Table S1.",20952efc-545f-4d37-932d-ccde4f1e15aa
10,methods6,"  Outcome assessment Cancers at any site (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) that occurred among the European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) cohort were assessed by population cancer registries in Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK, and by a combination of methods including health insurance records, cancer and pathology registries, and by active follow-up in Germany. Data on cancer incidence were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3). Data on total mortality was collected at the recruitment centres through mortality registries and used for censoring [17].  Incident T2D cases were ascertained at each participating centre by a combination of self-report, linkage to primary care registers, secondary-care registers, medication use (drug registers), hospital admissions, and mortality data.",70bb450d-c8a8-4ee1-b694-2c161d8b3cf1
11,methods7," Incident T2D cases in Denmark and Sweden were not self-reported but were defined according to local and national diabetes and pharmaceutical registries. To increase the specificity of the case definition for centres other than those from Denmark and Sweden, further evidence was sought for all cases with information on incident T2D from fewer than two independent sources at a minimum, including individual medical records review in some centres [18].  Coronary disease endpoints were defined as any coronary heart disease (CHD), comprised of myocardial infarction (MI) (ICD-10 codes: I21, I22), angina (I20), or other coronary heart disease (CHD) (I23-I25). Cerebrovascular events were ascertained and validated using the same methods as for coronary events and included haemorrhagic stroke (I60-I61), ischemic stroke (I63), unclassified stroke (I64), and other acute cerebrovascular events (I62, I65-69, F01).",b26dfc7e-5ce9-4022-8f0a-69294b7ed52f
12,methods8," First non-fatal coronary events were ascertained by different methods depending on the follow-up procedures by centre, using active follow-up through questionnaires or linkage with morbidity and hospital registries, or both [19]. Validation of suspected events was performed on all ascertained case events (Denmark, Germany, Italy, and Spain) or on a subset of events (Sweden, the Netherlands, and UK). Validation was performed by retrieving and assessing medical records or hospital notes, contact with medical professionals, retrieving and assessing death certificates, or verbal autopsy. Angina was not assessed as a first coronary heart disease (CHD) outcome in the Italian European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) centres of Varese, Torino, and in Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. Each outcome was classified as fatal or non-fatal with the exception of angina, which is never fatal.",f995d8e7-1646-4b33-aebe-d8662e6dca9d
13,methods9," In an attempt to harmonize the definition of fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) across centres, non-fatal and fatal events occurring within 28 days of each other were considered to be a single fatal event.  In order to harmonize the follow-up time for the three conditions, incident cases of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) ascertained after 31 December 2007 were censored. In European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-cardiovascular disease (CVD) centres with a censor date earlier than 31 December 2007, incident cases of cancer and T2D were censored at that date.

These values correspond, on average, to four and one healthy behaviours on the simplified healthy lifestyle index (HLI), respectively. CIFs were averaged over the distribution of the observed adjustment factors (centre, level of education, height, binary indicator for alcohol consumption, total energy intake, and for women, use of hormones).  Competing risks analysis was accounted for in the estimation of cause-specific hazard ratios and of CIFs.

In contrast, lifestyle factors were not associated with 3-year incidence of multimorbidity among community-dwelling older adults 75 years and older [15].

35,discussion3," This approach allowed the quantification of the preventive potential with regard to multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases.  The 10-year absolute risk estimates for cancer-cardiometabolic multimorbidity ranged between 5 and 17% for cancer patients, and between 20 and 40% for T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients, depending on sex and adherence to healthy lifestyles. In this respect, it is worthwhile mentioning that once an individual develops a cancer, the competing risk of mortality is comparatively larger than among individuals experiencing T2D or non-fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD). This explains why the absolute risk of developing multimorbidity was lower among cancer patients than among cardiovascular disease (CVD) or T2D patients. We further evaluated the risk of multimorbidity in patients developing cancer in sites with 5-year survival below or above 40% [25].",bea87784-1a4b-47b3-ba97-713431f97cec
36,discussion4," This supplementary analysis indicate that pre-diagnostic healthy lifestyles were particularly beneficial for patients developing cancer with longer survival, where, for example, the 10-year absolute risk of multimorbidity for 65-year old men with healthy and unhealthy lifestyle profiles were 11% and 24%, respectively (Additional file 1: Figure S8). The pronounced sex differences in risk patterns are likely to reflect larger prevalence of key risk factors in men than women. Importantly, the change in absolute risks related to healthy vs. unhealthy lifestyles indicate the preventive potential in terms of risk stratification for multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases. Many modifiable risk factors, including obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity are associated with multiple cancer types, T2D, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and could be the target of intervention strategies aiming at controlling multiple conditions, beyond efforts focusing on one disease only [10].",9186d92a-259a-4fbf-9291-9afd81790c8e
37,discussion5," A population-based cohort study in the Netherlands showed that participants aged 45 years and older who did not smoke, where of normal weight, and with no hypertension at baseline spent 21.6% of their remaining lifetime with one or more NCDs, compared to 31.8% of their remaining life for participants with all of these risk factors at baseline [27].  Exposure to risk factors that are associated with more than one disease is one plausible explanation for the clustering of NCDs in individuals and indicate common etiological pathways [28, 29]. For example, obesity promotes systemic inflammation, a well-described pathway for the development of cancer [30], cardiovascular disease (CVD) [31], and T2D [32].  This study has several strengths. First, we used individual-level data from a large prospective cohort of European adults using validated assessments of cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and T2D, together with study participants’ pre-diagnostic exposure to several lifestyle factors.",e410d3ba-78a4-49b4-9662-ca40e51eb20c
38,discussion6," Although European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) was designed to assess the occurrence of cancer, this study capitalized on the ascertainment of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and T2D events and related validation efforts carried out within the European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct [18] and European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-cardiovascular disease (CVD) [19] studies. Second, it is the largest study to date to estimate associations between modifiable exposures and the risk of multimorbidity. Third, associations were modelled in a multi-state framework accounting for the sequence of incident chronic conditions.  The study findings need to be interpreted in light of the following limitations.",282d962e-685b-4aab-8e39-6ec3bc430aa9
39,discussion7," First, information on lifestyle exposures assessed at baseline was used in this study, while potential changes in modifiable behaviours during lifetime, particularly after the diagnosis of NCDs, could not be accounted for in the investigation. Nevertheless, our results indicate associations between pre-diagnostic lifestyle habits and risk of NCDs and multimorbidity, assuming that exposure profiles prior to disease onset may have an impact on subsequent morbidities. Potential improvements in health behaviours after diagnosis of a first NCD would most likely have led to an underestimation of observed relative and absolute risks. Moreover, it has been shown that in the absence of interventions, the vast majority of individuals do not make major lifestyle changes following diagnosis of a serious chronic disease [33].",1f8ae5f6-fcf7-4034-bec1-3d215a45468e
40,discussion8," Second, associations between risk factors and the risk of multimorbidity after the occurrence of a first disease may be affected by collider bias as exemplified in the obesity paradox [34, 35], and such a bias tends to weaken observed associations. In our study, however, risk estimates were in the expected direction and magnitude after conditioning on the first disease, suggesting that collider bias was of limited concern in our study. An additional limitation was the lack of treatment data after a first NCD. Metformin, which is recommended as first-line therapy in most T2D patients, has been found to decrease cardiovascular risk and possibly some cancers [32, 36]. In contrast, the increased risk of cardiac diseases following cancer therapy is well recognized [37]. However, assuming that treatment is independent of lifestyle, then our observed associations should be unaffected by treatment.",5368a0f6-dafd-4765-8fca-09c990da9d7c
41,discussion9," Finally, although our relative risk estimates should be generalizable, the absolute risks associated with lifestyle factors heavily depend on the underlying risks of the study population, which however may be different in the general population.  In conclusion, healthy lifestyle behaviours were strongly inversely associated with the risk of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases. Healthy lifestyles prior to a first NCD may also contribute to a favourable prognosis of these diseases by reducing risk of multimorbidity. These findings provide strong support to public health recommendations to adhere to multiple healthy lifestyle factors.  Supplementary information  Additional file 1:  Figure S1.
