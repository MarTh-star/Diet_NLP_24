0,methods0," Data generated in two cohorts (the Cohort Study (CRIBS) and the NIH cohort) were utilized in this study. The Cohort Study (CRIBS) cohort represents 266 pregnant women (19-46 years of age) from Dalmatia, Croatia and the NIH cohort encompasses 344 women (22–91 years of age) from the same region. Demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle data were collected through self-completed questionnaires in both cohorts. Medical data were retrieved from the hospital medical records in the Cohort Study (CRIBS) cohort and through questionnaires filled out by a medical professional in the NIH study. Anthropometric measurements were taken by trained medical staff in both cohorts. Blood samples from pregnant Cohort Study (CRIBS) women were taken in the second trimester (between 22nd and 26th week of gestation) and from NIH participants during fieldwork. All the biochemical analyses were performed at the accredited laboratory of the Dubrava Clinical Hospital in Zagreb, Croatia.",5542c801-c2ce-432f-9854-e3253fc6c2d8
1,methods1," All data from the Cohort Study (CRIBS) cohort are pregnancy-adjusted. More detailed descriptions of collected anthropometric, clinical and laboratory data from both cohorts are summarized in previous studies [18,19,20,21].  In this study, the following covariates were considered: age, smoking status (smoker, non-smoker, ex-smoker), physical activity at work and recreationally (high, moderate, low), parity, miscarriages, socioeconomic status (SES) (education level, financial status), weight, height, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and biochemical parameters (glucose and diet-related blood lipid levels: triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol).",dd2d161e-4f64-4058-947e-f9d9687d755d
2,methods2," Nutritional data in the Cohort Study (CRIBS) cohort were derived from the Dietary Adequacy Assessment Questionnaire for Adults (Dietary Adequacy Assessment Questionnaire for Adults (DAAQA)), a food frequency questionnaire adapted from the Harvard Semiquantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire, as described in Havaš Auguštin et al. (2020) [17]. Dietary habits in the NIH cohort were assessed by a quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) used in several nutritional surveys of the Hvar population and tested for reproducibility and validity [22,23]. A Mediterranean Diet Serving Score was calculated for both cohorts as described in Monteagudo et al. 2015 [24]. The maximum possible Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) score in the original study was 24 points, and the cut-off of ≥13.5 points was considered as good compliance.",1a64aa89-2c6a-4116-90a9-a48652dcdecb
3,methods3," However, the maximum possible Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) score in this study was 23 points and the cut-off was set at ≥12.5 points—we excluded one category (alcoholic beverages) from the calculation, since Cohort Study (CRIBS) is a cohort of pregnant women.  The data processing procedures and analyses were written in Python 3.7 (https://www.python.org/. Last accessed on 26 September 2021). Raw data preprocessing methods were conducted according to our previous work [17]—all frequency data were converted to daily frequencies. The final data set combined of the two cohorts consisted of 610 participants (266 from the Cohort Study (CRIBS) and 344 from the NIH cohort). For investigating the participants’ nutrition and lifestyle patterns, a generalized least squares models (generalized least squares models (GLS)) with the statsmodels library were utilized [25].",6151a51c-112b-4e24-91ba-ae6ddd669576
4,methods4," The tested outcomes were the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) score and the cohort association (Cohort Study (CRIBS) or NIH). The two dataset groups were compared with all variables listed in Appendix A. Furthermore, the principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) was used to reveal potential differences in nutritional patterns between the two cohorts [26]. Prior to principal component analysis (PCA), low variance and highly intercorrelated variables were removed and sub-selected from a list of variables, as well as scaled.  3. Results  3.1. Differences between the Cohorts  Prior to the assessment of relationships and patterns between the two cohorts, we analyzed general cohort descriptors and differences. Figure 1 shows age distributions across both cohorts. The NIH cohort is larger (N = 344) compared to the Cohort Study (CRIBS) (N = 266), with NIH peeking around a median of 62 years and Cohort Study (CRIBS) with a median at 31 years of age.",d9dff438-398d-4840-b785-a6c774d66e2a
5,methods5," The union of the two cohorts has a median age of 41 years.  Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study participants and cohort differences in age distribution, women’s lifestyle and socioeconomic status (smoking, level of education, employment, financial status of the family), and Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS). Indicators of socioeconomic status (level of education, proportion of employed women and financial status) are all significantly higher in the group of women from the Cohort Study (CRIBS) cohort, whereas age and Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) are significantly higher in the NIH cohort. No significant difference between smoking prevalence has been detected between the two cohorts.  The differences between the two groups were also assessed by the utilization of principal component analysis (PCA). principal component analysis (PCA) was fed with 25 variables after the removal of variables with low-variance (<2%) and intercorrelated variables (>0.80).",2e0cb580-5182-420f-b225-36e4268520e0
6,methods6," The variables are given in Appendix A. Since principal component analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised analysis, we made sure no variables which could be driving the split between the variables are present (such as age—annotated in Appendix A). We generated a principal component analysis (PCA) scores plot with two principal components, which is given in Figure 2a, while the respective loadings are shown in Figure 2b. We colored the principal component analysis (PCA) score based on the cohort association (blue for NIH, red for Cohort Study (CRIBS)). The scores plot showed a good separation between the cohorts based on PC1.  The loading plot (Figure 2b) shows which variables have a high loading on the separation between the two groups in the scores plot in Figure 2a. They are colored with respect to the cohort association (red = Cohort Study (CRIBS), blue = NIH) on the first principal component.",6a7a3323-3c9a-4903-af22-1d4650002284
7,methods7," The highest loadings are assigned to the frequencies of consuming olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes (the first five). The variables used for principal component analysis (PCA) were utilized in a generalized least squares models (GLS) model to assess differences between the cohorts (0 = Cohort Study (CRIBS), 1 = NIH). All coefficients from the generated model including 25 variables were inspected (Appendix A). Results given in Table 2 show that five variables have coefficients with a high statistical significance (p < 0.001). The coefficients are sorted in descending order in the table. Positive trends towards the NIH cohort are therefore the frequencies of eating vegetables, white meat, sweets, fruits and dairy products. Negative trends towards the NIH cohort are the level of education, frequency of eating dried fruits, height, number of miscarriages, smoking status, HDL and smoking frequency.",26a4641a-3796-4b8c-b952-a8270fdc2765
8,methods8," The age variable was not considered in this calculation due to it being a strong discriminator between the cohorts.  3.2. Adherence to Mediterranean Diet Associates with Increasing Age  We aggregated the age variable of both cohorts together into four groups: “19–31” (N = 166), “32–46” (N = 164), “47–65” (N = 141) and “65–91” (N = 139). An inspection of the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) scores across aggregated age showed an increasing trend of Mediterranean diet adherence with increasing age (Figure 3a). The median Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) score was ascending with the age groups in the following order: “65–91” ~ “46–65” > “31–46” > “19–31”. Therefore, the two older age groups have a similar adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Furthermore, we inspected the adherence of participants in both cohorts (Figure 2b) and we observed that the NIH cohort had a higher adherence compared to the Cohort Study (CRIBS) cohort (encompassing only pregnant women).",7f04a522-fab2-4647-ba9f-0de80bd5d567
9,methods9,"  The relationship between age and the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) (outcome) was further tested in a generalized least squares models (GLS) model. The model was fed two predictive variables: age cut (four categories) and cohort (0 = Cohort Study (CRIBS), 1 = NIH). Both variables showed positive coefficients with regards to the outcome (Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS)) for age of 1.0820 (stderr = 0.559; p = 0.053) and cohort of 1.5590 (stderr = 0.419; p = 0.000). The results indicated that the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) score increased around +1 for age categories and, for the cohort, the increase was ~1.5 from Cohort Study (CRIBS) to NIH. The variables were corrected for each other.  3.3. Lifestyle Is Associated with Mediterranean Dietary Pattern  The comparison of adherence to the Mediterranean diet in a total sample of participants from both cohorts with different biological variables and lifestyle characteristics is presented in Table 3.",a7776244-c0bd-49a5-a7f3-bacbd8e1d85a
10,methods10," Both cohorts were analyzed using the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (Monteagudo et al. 2015) and the cut-off was set at 12.5 points (<12.5 points for low adherence, ≥12.5 points for high adherence). We inspected the association of the calculated Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) in both cohorts with education, income, working status, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as with age, anthropometry, blood pressure and biochemical profile.  Smoking prevalence was significantly higher in the group of women who do not follow the recommendations of the Mediterranean diet (p < 0.001). Although BMI was on the borderline of normal weight and overweight in both groups, the results showed significantly higher scores in the group with higher Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) (p < 0.01). Significant differences were observed for fasting glucose and lipids levels.",1a11f9c4-f8ab-462f-ad32-a2a42164810a
11,methods11," Although in a normal range for both groups of participants, significantly lower levels of blood glucose were found in the non-adhering group of women (p < 0.001). Also, all parameters of serum lipids levels (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL) were significantly lower in the group with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Higher blood pressure (p < 0.001 for diastolic and p < 0.01 for systolic blood pressure), glucose levels (p < 0.001) and BMI values (p < 0.01) have been observed in the adhering group.  In addition to the univariate statistical test, we have trained a generalized least squares models (GLS) model on the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) score (binary, 1 if Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) ≥ 12.5) which returned only four variables to have coefficients with a p-value below 0.01, namely “olive oil” (coef. 0.309 [0.208; 0.410]), “fruit” (coef. 0.268 [0.084; 0.452]); “plant oil” (coef. 0.150 [0.041; 0.259]) and “smoking daily” (coef. −0.",f75a04db-5898-4462-a7b9-aff7fb50952c
12,methods12,"346 [−0.586; −0.105]). The number of variables is expected, since variables are corrected for each other (as opposite to univariate tests). Even though Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) consists of scoring for the given variables, we wanted to inspect which of these variables are driving the difference in Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) the most. The model results show that a higher Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) score is associated with using olive and plant oil, and eating fruits more frequently, whereas smoking is associated with low Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) scores.  4. Discussion  We have compared two cohorts from the same Mediterranean region of Dalmatia, Croatia to investigate their diet, lifestyle habits and health and analyzed observed similarities and differences. The NIH cohort encompasses older women mainly from rural communities and as such, should reflect a more traditional diet and lifestyle.",48daaa0b-68dd-4597-8c11-1266677e424d
13,methods13," However, the traditional diet (home-cooked, unprocessed food from home-grown fruits and vegetables, dairy products from free-range goats and sheep) has become less present even in small, rural communities in Croatia, such as island populations. The observed changes are characterized by an increased consumption of red meat, sugar, and industrial, processed products and a sedentary lifestyle [16]. The NIH cohort has been analyzed previously with regards to the metabolic syndrome. A high prevalence of metabolic abnormalities (especially central obesity, dyslipidemia, and pro-inflammatory factors) has been observed in the sampled population [18,19]. The Cohort Study (CRIBS) cohort is represented by a younger generation and encompasses only pregnant women.",d275fbab-177f-4f48-a2ad-cc92c823ddcd
14,methods14," Although healthy food patterns and lifestyle should be priorities during pregnancy and good or moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet was expected in the Cohort Study (CRIBS) cohort, our previous study showed a poor level of adherence [17].  The main finding of the present study is that generational differences have been detected when comparing these two cohorts. Although the NIH cohort is older and has previously been characterized as a population at substantial risk for cardiovascular diseases, it still practices a healthier and more traditional lifestyle and diet when compared to the younger generation of pregnant women from the same region. Education level, employment status and financial status are significantly higher in the group of women from the Cohort Study (CRIBS) cohort.",89264f9f-34c5-4ddb-98ce-86ecf47a15d2
15,methods15," This finding reflects the change in modern society and generational differences where older women were more prone to stay at home and attend to household chores, while younger generations of women are more career-oriented. It should be emphasized that half of the women willing to be enrolled in the Cohort Study (CRIBS) study had a high educational level (college degree, master or PhD). However, despite being more educated and wealthier, younger women from Dalmatia adhere less to the Mediterranean diet in comparison to older women from the same geographical area. When inspecting the association between diet and participant age, higher age was directly associated with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet, similar to the other research conducted in the Mediterranean region which has also recognized the trend of older age groups being more prone to the traditional dietary habits than young adults [11,27,28].",c54e576e-6244-4d90-9009-9be0863619d3
16,methods16," When the two cohorts are analyzed in more detail, specific differences are observed. Namely, women from the NIH cohort eat more individual food items characteristic of the Mediterranean diet (vegetables, white meat, fruit, dairy), while pregnant women from the Cohort Study (CRIBS) cohort have an increased miscarriage rate and smoke more frequently. Although European statistics show that <10% of women continue to smoke during pregnancy in studies conducted after 2010, pregnant women in our birth cohort show a high prevalence (23%) [29]. This prevalence corresponds to the prevalence in the NIH cohort, indicating that no change in behavior occurs with pregnancy in Mediterranean Croatia. Maternal smoking is also usually a marker of social inequality, with higher rates of pregnant smokers observed among women with lower educational levels, lower income and unemployment [29].",a8fc2186-9e7a-45b2-a0df-6f7200450e04
17,methods17," However, most of the pregnant participants (in the Cohort Study (CRIBS) cohort) have a beneficial socioeconomic status (SES). Smoking, especially during pregnancy, is also directly associated with being unaware of the importance of healthy eating habits. From a subsample of smokers in the cohort of pregnant women, only 15% of them also follow a traditional healthy food pattern. In the NIH cohort the situation is a little bit better—42% of women who smoke adhere to the Mediterranean diet. Similar findings were confirmed in other investigated populations where smokers were less likely to comply with the Mediterranean diet and negative lifestyle behaviors were similarly reflected in unhealthy dietary patterns [28]. Physical activity levels and biochemical profiles were not significantly different between the cohorts.",e652ef2f-b932-4a75-949e-64b5d0df22de
18,methods18,"  When inspected in more detail, our study suggests that high olive and plant oil consummation, as well as eating fruit, are most responsible for a high Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) score in our total sample. Certain lifestyle characteristics have also been associated with a healthy diet. Namely, smoking prevalence was significantly higher in the group of women who do not follow the recommendations of the Mediterranean diet. Previous studies also indicated that the Mediterranean diet shows significant beneficial effects regarding blood lipid control [30,31]. Our study confirmed this finding, since high adherence correlated with lower LDL levels, as well as lower triglycerides and cholesterol values when the whole sample is taken into consideration. Interestingly, higher blood pressure, glucose and BMI values, as well as lower HDL levels, have been observed in the adhering group.",bc3863fc-fa41-4555-b5c4-08f2e4cae181
19,methods19," Although a healthy diet is usually associated with beneficial effects for these biological markers and body mass, obtained results can be explained by the higher age of participants, which then correlates with higher blood pressure and glucose values, as well as increased weight.  5. Conclusions  Urbanization, population growth and the progressive globalization of the food market have been identified as potential causative factors for the global shift in dietary and lifestyle habits and, particularly, the abandonment of the Mediterranean dietary pattern, which has significant repercussions on individual health. A generation shift has been observed in this study and it reflects itself in both nutritional habits (adherence to the Mediterranean diet) and lifestyle differences (smoking, socioeconomic status) between the two tested cohorts of women.",0447ef75-d158-4eba-8311-4ca33c275602
20,methods20," Our study suggests that the young, reproductively active generation in Dalmatia, Croatia, although having a higher socioeconomic status and being pregnant, exhibits a more adverse eating behavior (lower Mediterranean Diet Serving Score) and lifestyle (excessive smoking in pregnancy) than the older population from the same region. Therefore, it is important to raise awareness among youth and encourage them to adopt healthy and sustainable lifestyle patterns based on balanced nutrition. ",9007f7be-01a0-4468-b4af-4772775d0564
