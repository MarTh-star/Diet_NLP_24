0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design  This was a cross-sectional observational study with chain sampling, where contact was established with the supervision of different sections of different health departments in the province of Alicante, Spain. The study was carried out in accordance with international recommendations on clinical research and the ethical code of the World Health Organization (Declaration of Helsinki). All participants signed the informed consent form, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Catholic University of Murcia (Code CE022008).  2.2. Participants  A total of 240 female nursing staff (nurses and nursing assistants) (37 ± 10 years) from health departments in the province of Alicante participated in this study. Women who were pregnant or under medical or psychiatric treatment were excluded.",796fe78a-5412-408d-8bbd-6b6e64ccb91d
1,methods1," The study population was divided according to the work shift they had performed during the last year, which could be: (a) fixed morning shift (fixed morning shift (FMS)) (Monday to Friday from 8 am to 3 pm); (b) 7 h rotating shift (RS7) (2 days from 8 am to 3 pm, 2 days from 3 pm to 10 pm, 2 days from 10 pm to 8 am and 3 days off); (c) 12 h rotating shift (RS12) (1 day from 8 am to 8 pm, 1 day from 8 pm to 8 am and 3 days off).  2.3. Data Collection  2.3.1. Sociodemographic and Mediterranean Diet Adherence  An ad hoc questionnaire was prepared with the aim of determining different data, integrating questions related to age, sex, height, weight, work shift (fixed morning shift (FMS), RS7, RS12), pregnancy, and medical or psychiatric treatment.  Adherence to Mediterranean dietary patterns was assessed by a modified version of the previously validated questionnaire used in the PREDIMED trial.",866939dd-da87-4492-97cd-9359048d6319
2,methods2," Registered dietitians administered the PREDIMED-PLUS (17-item MedDiet) questionnaire measuring adherence to an energy-restricted MedDiet [28,29]. This questionnaire includes information on the characteristics of the MD and the consumption of: (1) oil; (2) fruits; (3) vegetables; (4) white bread; (5) whole grains; (6) meat; (7) fats; (8) sugary drinks; (9) legumes; (10) fish; (11) pastries; (12) nuts; (13) white meats; (14) fried foods; (15) sweeteners; (16) refined cereals; (17) wine. Compliance with food habits scored 1 for every item, but otherwise scored 0. Therefore, results of the 17-item MedDiet questionnaire ranged between 0 and 17. Terciles were made to define low, moderate or high adherence, ranging from 0 to 7, 8 to 10, and 11 to 17, respectively.  2.3.2. Eating Disorders  The Eating Attitudes Test, in its reduced 26-item version (EAT−26) [30], which has been validated in Spanish women [31], was used for the evaluation as a possible screening for the future presence of an ED.",d1e24332-3e5e-430f-8dac-b6c4ed123861
3,methods3," Through the global computation of its 26 items, which are classified into three differentiated scales: (a) food restriction (avoidance of fattening foods and preoccupation with thinness); (b) bulimia and preoccupation with food; and (c) oral control [32], this self-administered questionnaire provides information on the possible risks associated with an ED. Among its items are questions that allow the detection of actions related to purging, diuretic use and binge eating, among others. The score to determine the test as positive, and alert the presence of a possible ED, either AN or BN, is 20 points out of a possible 78 [33]. The answers to this questionnaire are presented in the Likert format, from 1 (never) to 6 (always), whose order will represent a score of “0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2 and 3 points” in all questions, except for items 1 and 25, “I like to eat with other people” and “I enjoy trying new and tasty foods”, in which the score is established in the reverse order.",e27be61c-64be-49ad-9f0a-0bf2ad9afbb8
4,methods4," For reliability and internal consistency analysis, Cronbach’s Alpha (α) was performed for each of the subscales: dieting (α = 0.794); bulimia and food preoccupation (α = 0.752); and oral control (α = 0.732) for the total EAT-26 score (α = 0.825).  2.4. Statistical Analysis  For statistical analysis of the data, descriptive statistics (mean ± standard deviation), normality tests (Kolmogorov–Smirnov) and comparison of means were performed.  Comparison of means was performed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), establishing BMI as a co-variate. Bonferroni was established as a post hoc test. A significance level was established when the p-value was less than 0.05. The effect size was calculated using the partial eta-squared statistic (η2p), where the following indicators were established: small (0.01), medium (0.06) and large (0.14) [34]. The statistical analysis was carried out using the free statistical software JAMOVI (version 0.9).  3.",59dff1a8-81cf-4f14-ac31-14956e9c7cb9
5,methods5," Results  A total of 240 female nursing staff (nurses and nursing assistants) (37 ± 10 years), from health departments in the province of Alicante, Spain, participated. The average weight was between 62.8 kg and 63.5 kg, the average height was between 164.3 cm and 165.2 cm, and the average BMI was between 23–23.9 kg/m2. Table 1 represents the characteristics of the study sample.  Table 1 also shows the score obtained in the different groups following analysis of the data derived from the evaluation with the PREDIMED-PLUS questionnaire that assesses adherence to the MD. No significant differences were observed between groups (F = 0.065; p = 0.799; η2p = 0.001) and the effect size was insignificant. All groups showed an average score between 7–8 points. Table 2 shows descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) of the PREDIMED PLUS questionnaire items according to each group and its comparison.",738af315-8bc5-452c-805e-d8100b11f412
6,methods6," There are significant differences between groups in the consumption of white bread (item 4), with higher consumption in those nurses who have rotating shifts. There are also significant differences in the consumption of sugary drinks or sweetened fruit juices (Item 8), being lower in the RS12 group compared to RS7 and TMF. Finally, nurses with rotating shifts have a higher consumption of sweeteners instead of sugar (item 15).  Table 3 presents the comparison between the different subscales and total score obtained in the EAT-26 questionnaire for each of the population groups, according to work shift. In the restriction subscale, the RS7 group showed a significantly higher score than the fixed morning shift (FMS) group (p ≤ 0.001) and the RS12 group (p = 0.020), with a medium effect size. Although the RS12 group also presented higher values than fixed morning shift (FMS), the difference was not significant.",22078460-a5bd-4356-87d0-9ee473b334d8
7,methods7," Regarding the bulimia subscale, similarly, the RS7 group presented significantly higher values compared to the fixed morning shift (FMS) group (p ≤ 0.001) and the RS12 group (p = 0.05), also with a small effect size. In this case, the increased score of the RS12 group was not significantly higher than that obtained by the fixed morning shift (FMS) group. In the oral control subscale, no significant differences were found between the different groups. Finally, in the total score of the EAT-26 questionnaire, the RS7 group again reported, although with a small effect size, a significantly higher score than the fixed morning shift (FMS) group (p ≤ 0.001) and the RS12 group (p = 0.010), which did not present differences between them.  4. Discussion  The aim of the study was to describe adherence to the MD in nurses according to their different works shifts and the possible future presence of an ED in nurses depending on their work shift.",d320df26-810e-4f31-921e-a566d331dd3b
8,methods8," The evaluated adherence to the MD in the nursing staff is low: the results are below the mean, without differences according to the work shift in which they performed.  On the other hand, it has been shown that women in the RS7 group show increased values compared to the fixed morning shift (FMS) and RS12 groups in restriction, bulimia and total score on the EAT-26 questionnaire. Meanwhile, although the RS12 group also presents higher values than the fixed morning shift (FMS) group, this is not sufficient to show a statistically significant difference between the groups. Thus, the nurses and nursing assistants evaluated through the self-reported questionnaire who have a RS7 work pattern present a greater risk of suffering from an eating behaviour disorder compared to the nursing staff on a fixed morning shift (FMS) or RS12 work pattern, showing a greater avoidance of fattening foods, concern about thinness, bulimia symptomatology and concern about the foods they consume.",c0f24dc0-94ce-4b89-8f14-c5ac36841777
9,methods9,"  This could be due to the fact that more unstable shifts in terms of time patterns may condition their eating habits, and may consequently present incorrect behaviours, potentially predisposing to an ED, although there is no conditioning of the overall food selection, because no differences have been observed on the PREDIMED-PLUS questionnaire scores.  Souza et al. [35] also studied eating habits in jobs subjected to rotating shifts and fixed-shift work. They concluded that shift workers show changes in meal patterns, skipping more meals and consuming more food at unconventional times compared to regular shift workers.",5c2cf7f0-151d-4ae3-a6b0-c48e60d3b55b
10,methods10,"  Furthermore, both in a study conducted with nurses in USA [12] and in Japan [36], it was found that the distribution of food intake and food choice changed depending on the work shift, with a higher consumption of protein and fatty foods being observed in workers who belonged to the rotating group, highlighting the consumption of foods such as beef, eggs, juices and pasta, which suggests that the adherence to the MD is poor. Roskoden et al. [37] also conducted research on shift workers, studying their dietary habits, and established that shift workers tended to decrease the fibre content of their diet but increase the sucrose content. These findings coincide with the present investigation, since it has been observed that nurses who have rotating shifts have a higher consumption of bread and sugary beverages compared to those who work from 8 am to 3 pm.  Finally, a study by Gifkins et al.",350579a2-7318-4ce1-a896-34f09d22ac48
11,methods11," [26] on shift-working nurses found that there was an increase in food cravings, caffeine consumption and snacking behaviours during night shifts, besides an inability to consume enough fluids at work. Experienced nurses described more skipped meals at work [26]. These results do not concur with our research because the present study found no significant differences in eating habits according to work shift. However, it does correspond with the low quality of eating patterns in nursing staff.  Nevertheless, the results of the present research coincide with other studies, such as that carried out with nurses in Mérida [13], in which no significant differences were observed between those with rotating or fixed shifts in terms of eating habits. This could be explained by the difficulty of access to certain foods due to commitment to the patient and work overload.",c1c9b9a3-d416-4c37-a8cf-2cb50adf02c3
12,methods12,"  Other researchers [38,39] also suggest that working shift schedules alters not only the usual meal schedule, but also the accessibility of healthy meals, which can generate multiple health-related problems.  On the other hand, previous research using the EAT-26 questionnaire in nursing staff showed similar values [2], although no significant differences were found in either the total score or the different subscales [2]. This can be explained by the fact that the sample was divided between regular and irregular schedules (without further investigation of shift schedules). In addition, one group was significantly larger than the other.  The works by Jung et al. [17] and Kim et al. [40] have already observed that night work increases the incidence of appetite disorders and impacts physical and psychological well-being.",e8ea975a-1c67-4c32-9a49-11c12bb88425
13,methods13," Furthermore, it has also been established [41] that there are different dimensions of eating behaviour that are related to emotional eating, and this is associated with a deficit in impulse control [42], characteristic of uncontrolled eating and the ED subtype BN.  These results highlight that it is necessary to emphasize that preventive measures should be taken to minimize the pathological conditions that may arise as a result of shift work. Therapeutic strategies should revolve around the way in which work is organised and the autonomy in decision-making of each person, in terms of family and social status, as well as health surveillance. In addition, healthy eating behaviour prevention programmes should be implemented. This would mitigate the detrimental effects of low adherence to the MD and EDs.  This study has some limitations. Firstly, it is a cross-sectional study, which does not allow us to establish causal relationships between the study variables.",a5d28195-17e7-40ea-a784-cb82fe75796b
14,methods14," Future research should carry out a longitudinal study in order to look deeper into the subject. Furthermore, it should be noted that the data are self-referenced; thus, there could be a bias in the responses. On the other hand, no men participated in the study, so these data are only applicable to female nurses. It should also be noted that few studies have analysed these variables in nursing staff and, as a consequence, the studies compared do not use the same questionnaires to assess adherence and eating habits. However, it is consistent with current evidence that shift workers’ eating habits suffer from alterations in the quality, quantity and timing of meals. These unhealthy eating habits can lead to an imbalance in the feeling of satiety and, together with negative emotions, may favour the development of EDs.",38f6a8df-3929-4fc0-a673-8aca69a130e1
15,methods15,"  Rotational shifts may compromise the mental health of nursing staff in relation to eating habits, affecting the quantity and quality of the food intake (macro and micronutrients). For this reason, in future research, the possibility of a prolonged follow-up could be considered to study the changes that the nursing staff present in relation to different variables and health indicators, such as sleep disturbance, changes in body composition, circulating parameters, heart rate variability, etc.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, in this study the adherence to a MD in nursing staff is seen to be average or poor, with no differences depending on the work shift they perform. However, nurses on the RS7 work pattern show a greater avoidance of fattening foods, preoccupation with thinness, symptomatology of bulimia and preoccupation with the foods they eat.",9196002d-4ca4-486b-b583-c0f91659b31c
16,methods16," This leads to an increasing possibility of manifesting an ED, especially in terms of the establishment of restrictive behaviours, as well as risky eating behaviours or bulimic behaviours, related to an ED.  This information should be taken into account in order to develop programmes for healthy eating habits and the prevention of EDs in nursing staff to improve their quality of life and job performance.
