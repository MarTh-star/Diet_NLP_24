0,introduction0," The Rome IV process identified 5 separate but overlapping bowel disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)), functional constipation (FC), functional diarrhea, functional bloating/distension, and unspecified functional bowel disorder (1). Of these conditions, FC and Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are 2 of the most prevalent, affecting 11.7% and 4.1% in a recent survey of more than fifty-four thousand individuals from all over the world (2). Patients with bowel disorders often identify food as an important trigger for their gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. For example, in a survey of nearly 200 patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) from Sweden, 84% identified food as a key trigger for their GI symptoms (3). The reasons that underlie the relationship between food and the development of GI symptoms are discussed in detail in another manuscript (4).",7da5fa67-21c4-49fe-a411-b28a04a4a5cf
1,introduction1," In many patients with meal-related GI symptoms, diet manipulation is a natural first step in the treatment plan. At present, the greatest proportion of the literature addressing diet interventions to treat bowel disorders focuses on Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and FC. In this article, we summarize the evidence that supports usual dietary advice, fiber supplementation, a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) (a low FODMAP diet [low FODMAP diet (LFD)]), other emerging holistic and targeted dietary interventions, and functional foods for these conditions.",c6380715-0cfc-4d84-894c-e9ce3adad90e
2,introduction2,"  DIETARY INTERVENTIONS FOR Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  General dietary advice  First-line dietary management strategies for patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other bowel disorders include healthy eating habits such as those outlined by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)), United Kingdom (5), with similar recommendations made by the British Dietetic Association (6) (Table 1). Both sets of guidelines are based on low and moderate quality evidence, and, despite widespread use and acceptance of these recommendations, there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing this approach with habitual or sham dietary interventions.  Table 1.",fa6c7950-2a1b-42d8-9023-89b8441faa3a
3,introduction3," Summary of healthy eating habits for bowel disorders based on modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and British Deitetic Association (BDA) guidelines (5,6)  Both National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and British Deitetic Association (British Deitetic Association (BDA)) guidelines recommend these healthy eating strategies as a first-line therapy for patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), with the low FODMAP diet reserved for those with persistent symptoms. However, a recent meta-analysis found that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines were not superior to any of the alternative or control dietary interventions analyzed (7).",5634ef6e-cdce-4aeb-ab27-0369973b2f26
4,introduction4," This was in contrast to individual trial results whereby the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines had similar efficacy to low FODMAP diet (LFD), providing adequate relief in 41% of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhea (Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-D) participants in the United States (8) and reducing total Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-severity scoring system (Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-SSS) in 46% of participants with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in Sweden (9). Despite this, other considerations, such as ease of implementation and more broad health benefits of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, suggest they are still of importance as a first-line therapy in managing bowel disorders.  Fiber supplementation  Dietary fiber comprises a diverse group of nondigestible carbohydrates containing varying length chains of sugar monomers.",9a4cbc0d-5ae4-4335-b281-777621101b6e
5,introduction5," Fiber is characterized by heterogeneity in structure, functional properties including bulking, viscosity/gel formation, and fermentability (Table 2), and clinical effects (10). Dietary fiber represents a wide variety of fiber types with varied functional properties (11). Despite how commonly fiber is the target of manipulation in clinical practice, the effect of systematically altering dietary fiber intake in patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has not been formally reported. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend limited intake of high-fiber foods (e.g., whole meal bread) and resistant starch (e.g., processed or recooked foods), largely on the basis of expert opinion. Most clinical evidence relates to the use of specific fiber types as supplements, where monotherapy with psyllium (ispaghula) or wheat bran have been the main fibers assessed in RCTs.",2f919dff-1de7-42f4-a5fb-68c99d28deff
6,introduction6," Meta-analyses have reported symptomatic benefit only for psyllium (7–30 g/d, number needed to treat (number needed to treat (NNT)) = 7) and not for wheat bran (12), inulin, or oligosaccharides (13). Based on these findings, clinical practice guidelines have recommended the use of soluble fibers and avoidance of insoluble fibers for patients with bowel disorders such as Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation. Unfortunately, dichotomizing the benefit of fiber on the basis of solubility oversimplifies the many ways in which fiber can influence the luminal microenvironment and gut function (10,14).  Table 2. Fiber types based on functional characteristics (10)  The goals of introducing fiber supplements to patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are 4-fold. First, fibers have been applied to normalize stool characteristics.",769b8808-4b6a-4d86-ba30-f229ccac265d
7,introduction7," For example, fibers with particulate and water retention properties (such as wheat bran or sugarcane bagasse (10)) may hasten colonic transit time and increase fecal bulk in patients with slow colonic transit, whereas fibers with viscous characteristics (such as psyllium) have been better for normalizing stool form. Second, fibers, through direct and indirect effects, may improve the structure and function of the gut microbiota. As substrates for fermentation, dietary fibers may be associated with benefits to gut health from, for example, delivery of short-chain fatty acids to the colonic mucosa (15). Currently, such suggestions are largely aspirational, given the lack of supportive outcomes data. Third, fibers can be used to correct or prevent problems associated with other diet therapies, especially the low FODMAP diet (LFD), which tends to reduce fiber intake, potentially leading to suboptimal benefits for stool characteristics and reduced fermentation in the distal colon (16).",2570e3ff-6f94-4005-a104-470d515ff6da
8,introduction8," Finally, a major goal when initiating fiber supplementation is to avoid exacerbating Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, which presents as a real risk for fibers that contain readily fermentable and, hence, gas-producing components, such as fructans alone or when present in wheatbran and resistant starch. The use of nonfermented or very slowly fermented fibers such as sugarcane bagasse and psyllium are relatively well tolerated (17,18) and both, by virtue of slowing fermentation and the rate of gas production, may be well tolerated when used with fermentable fiber (17–19). Clinical experience indicates, however, that a gradual introduction of additional fiber is better tolerated than initiating a large dose.  THE low FODMAP diet (LFD)  Pathophysiology  Initially, the effects of FODMAPs on gut physiology were believed to be primarily due to stimulation of mechanoreceptors as a response to luminal distention (20).",7159ceeb-e68c-4cf2-8b2c-df4020125420
9,introduction9," While fructose distends the small bowel with water due to its osmotic effects, fructans distends the colon from release of gases (such as hydrogen and methane) due to bacterial fermentation (21). However, recent studies indicate that their contribution to Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pathophysiology is much more complex (Figure 1). Rodent studies suggest that a high FODMAP diet can cause dysbiosis, colonic barrier dysfunction, recruitment and activation of mast cells, and visceral hypersensitivity (22–24). Two pathways of FODMAP-mediated visceral hypersensitivity have been proposed. In rodents, a high FODMAP diet leads to an abundance of Gram-negative bacteria that increase luminal lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can activate mast cells through toll-like receptor 4 to release bioactive molecules such as tryptase, histamine, and prostaglandin E2,23 which can increase intestinal permeability and visceral sensitivity (12,23).",e3a4b0c3-8927-4a9f-aa5c-92cbf80982ad
10,introduction10, Mouse studies have also reported that FODMAP-mediated visceral hypersensitivity is associated with an increased expression of advanced glycosylation end product–specific receptor and is ameliorated in the presence of an antiglycation agent (24).  Figure 1. FODMAPs exert multiple effects in the GI tract.  In vitro studies using a mouse model indicate that fecal supernatants from patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-D on a high FODMAP diet significantly increase mast cell activation compared with fecal supernatants from healthy controls (23). This effect is ameliorated in the absence of toll-like receptor 4 and after an low FODMAP diet (LFD) (23).,ade205a0-b5b7-4cc4-ba13-822baa4b2936
11,introduction11," Conversely, 2 small studies in patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-D found that an low FODMAP diet (LFD) led to significantly reduced fecal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels (22,23) and an increased colonic expression of tight junction proteins and decreased markers of mast cell activation, including serum histamine and tryptase (22,23). While these observations expand the range of possible reasons that FODMAPs might cause GI symptoms, they require further clinical validation before concluding that there is a clear cause and effect relationship.  Efficacy data  In the seminal feeding trial, Halmos et al. (22) performed a single-blind, crossover RCT in which 30 patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were randomized to an low FODMAP diet (LFD) vs a typical Australian diet for 21 days. The primary endpoint was overall GI symptoms measured using a 0–100 mm visual analog scale.",71fec9cd-436c-4e9d-8d43-8630336dd1ec
12,introduction12," The study found that the overall GI symptom score was significantly lower in the low FODMAP diet (LFD) group compared with that found in the typical Australian diet group (22.8 vs 44.9, P < 0.001) (25). Subsequent to this trial, numerous RCTs have investigated the efficacy of low FODMAP diet (LFD) in patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A recent network meta-analysis pooled data from 13 RCTs evaluating the efficacy of low FODMAP diet (LFD) in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and found that low FODMAP diet (LFD) was superior to other dietary interventions in achieving improvement in global Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, abdominal pain, and bloating (7). However, this network meta-analysis did not find low FODMAP diet (LFD) superior to other dietary interventions in achieving an improvement in bowel habits in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) even if the analysis was restricted to patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-D (7).",145dae66-a684-402f-b702-ebec6e0dac50
13,introduction13,"  Low-FODMAP diet compared with other active diet interventions  Given the difficulty in blinding and using a true placebo in dietary intervention studies, several have compared low FODMAP diet (LFD) with another active dietary intervention. A multicenter, parallel group, single-blind RCT from Sweden compared a dietitian-led low FODMAP diet (LFD) with standard dietary advice (based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines) over 4 weeks in 75 patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (9). Both groups experienced significant improvement in symptom severity (measured using Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-SSS) at the end of the 4 weeks compared with that in baseline (P < 0.001), without a difference between the groups (P = 0.62) (9).",f7c36d6e-6183-45f6-9a2f-9512bc4b1b94
14,introduction14," In a US study, 84 patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-D were randomized to an low FODMAP diet (LFD) or modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (mNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)) diet for 4 weeks (8). Fifty-two percentage of the patients in the low FODMAP diet (LFD) group reported an adequate relief of overall Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms compared with 41% in the mNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) group; the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.31). However, an low FODMAP diet (LFD) resulted in a significantly higher proportion of abdominal pain and bloating responders compared with those in the mNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) group (P < 0.01(8) for both comparisons).",911861f2-3165-4674-8f81-41cf2d185184
15,introduction15," This study also reported improvements in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-related quality of life and reductions in activity impairment with low FODMAP diet (LFD) compared with those with the mNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) diet (26).  Three studies have compared the efficacy of an low FODMAP diet (LFD) with a traditional diet based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines in regions not consuming a western diet (e.g., Iran, India, and China (27–29)). While 2 of these studies reported significantly greater improvement in GI symptoms with an low FODMAP diet (LFD) (27,28), 1study did not find a significant difference between the groups (29). Finally, the recent network meta-analysis discussed earlier found low FODMAP diet (LFD) superior to a diet based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for global Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, abdominal pain, and bloating (7).",aec64ed7-74c5-4cd0-88b3-20f6839d56cf
16,introduction16,"Recently, smartphone app-based delivery of low FODMAP diet (LFD) was shown superior to medical therapy with otilonium bromide in a large RCT of 453 primary care patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Seventy-one percentage of the patients in the low FODMAP diet (LFD) group responded (defined by a 50-point decrease in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-SSS) compared with 61% in the medical therapy group (P = 0.03) (30).  Low FODMAP diet compared with placebo/sham diet  In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial from the United Kingdom, a sham diet of similar complexity, intensity, and fiber/energy was compared with an low FODMAP diet (LFD) (31). Although the percentage of participants reporting adequate symptom relief in the intention-to-treat analysis did not reach statistical significance (57% in the low FODMAP diet (LFD) group vs 38% in the sham diet group, P = 0.051), the difference was significant in the per-protocol analysis (61% vs 39%, P = 0.042 (31)).",402be6ed-1030-4f87-968a-f2feed2a1fe7
17,introduction17," In addition, the Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-SSS for the low FODMAP diet (LFD) group was also significantly lower than that for the sham group (31). In a second multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial from the United Kingdom, patients had 2.3-fold higher odds of achieving adequate symptom control with an low FODMAP diet (LFD) compared with that for a sham low FODMAP diet (LFD), although this did not reach statistical significance (32).  low FODMAP diet (LFD) vs high FODMAP diet  Only one study by McIntosh et al. (33) compared an low FODMAP diet (LFD) with a high FODMAP diet in 40 patients for 3 weeks and found a significant reduction in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptom severity with an low FODMAP diet (LFD), whereas a high FODMAP diet led to a mild increase in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptom severity.",f4a8f6b9-b798-4cf8-a126-1367a8c56bba
18,introduction18,"  The low FODMAP diet (LFD) is a 3 step program  The low FODMAP diet (LFD) is a 3-step process involving an initial 2- to 6-week restriction phase (phase 1), followed by a rechallenge phase (phase 2) to identify food triggers, including dose tolerated, and, finally, a long-term maintenance (personalized) phase based on the outcome of the rechallenges (phase 3) (34) (Figure 2). Owing to the restrictive nature of phase 1, rechallenge to identify specific triggers in the individual and allow maximal reintroduction of tolerated foods is imperative to the long-term success of the diet. Phase 1 involves the reduction of high FODMAP foods such as wheat, onion, garlic, apples, and pears, with simultaneous replacement of suitable low FODMAP alternatives ideally from the same food group. Phase 1 should only be followed for as long as necessary to ascertain whether symptom response will occur (usually 4–6 weeks).",2689b22f-e610-4e5d-9b8f-1df1094ff9c2
19,introduction19," Phase 2 enables patients to identify specific food triggers and reintroduce tolerated foods back into the diet (35). While FODMAP intake has been shown to increase during phase 2 (12 ± 8 g/d vs 22 ± 11 g/d, P < 0.01), symptom control is ideally sustained (36). Likewise, in phase 3, symptomatic improvement typically continues at 12 months (adequate relief achieved in 67% vs 28% at baseline, P = 0.04) (37). Of importance, when the patient has not had guidance from a dietitian, adherence with phases 2 and 3 has been shown to be poor (phase 2: 70% vs 39% compliant, P = 0.02; phase 3: 65% vs 29% compliant, P < 0.01), and as such, it is recommended the diet be guided by an adequately trained dietitian (38). That said, future studies may assess the use of new technologies, such as mobile applications, which may change the way the diet is delivered and patients are monitored, especially where access to dietitians is limited (39,40).  Figure 2. The low FODMAP diet is a three step process.",5e000d60-1640-4881-944d-ce7eea9de9f8
20,introduction20,"  Each phase of the 3-step ‟top-down” low FODMAP diet (LFD) should be implemented in a personalized manner to maximize benefits and minimize restrictions. However, an alternative approach exists whereby only a few specific FODMAP subgroups are restricted based on diet history and ethnic risk profiles (41). This approach, termed bottom-up or FODMAP gentle, restricts only 1 or 2 FODMAP subgroups initially, evaluating symptom response and continuing to restrict further only if required (37). Emerging data suggest that fructans, mannitol, and galacto-oligosaccharides are reportedly the most consistent FODMAP subgroup to trigger symptoms (42,43), and lactose may be helpful to restrict in genetically susceptible individuals, although this remains controversial (41); hence, these may be most relevant to restrict initially (Figure 3). While only limited data exist for this approach, it may be best suited for those with milder symptoms, nutritional deficiencies, or at risk of disordered eating.",a691f3d7-6338-4668-9eef-c803ae462986
21,introduction21," The traditional top-down approach may be more challenging to undertake in the initial weeks, but following the rechallenge (phase 2) and maintenance (phase 3) phases, it may be better able to identify specific food triggers and hence improve the long-term success of the diet, although this has not been specifically studied.  Figure 3. “Top-down” or “Bottom-up” approaches to the low FODMAP diet.  Long-term data  All the above-mentioned studies have investigated the efficacy of the restriction phase of an low FODMAP diet (LFD). However, a few studies suggest that the restriction phase may be associated with reduced dietary intake of some micronutrients (e.g., iron and thiamine) and may lead to a reduced fecal abundance of putatively beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacteria spp. (44–46). Given its restrictive and cumbersome nature, the restriction phase is not a long-term strategy and, in responders, should always be followed by the reintroduction and personalization phases.",5677bba6-504c-4717-8888-c7fa28902e7e
22,introduction22,"  Recent prospective studies have investigated the long-term effectiveness of a personalized low FODMAP diet (LFD) (37,47–49). These studies show that up to 80% of patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients are on a personalized low FODMAP diet (LFD) 6–12 months after the restriction phase with 57%–67% of patients reporting adequate/satisfactory relief of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms (37,47,48). A small study (n = 41) with a mean follow-up of >12 months reported that a personalized low FODMAP diet (LFD) led to significant improvement in the quality of life and anxiety scores (49). Although some studies have raised concerns about inconvenience, nutritional deficiencies (45,49) and incremental costs with the restriction phase of low FODMAP diet (LFD), no difference in total energy intake, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake between individuals on a personalized low FODMAP diet (LFD) were compared with those on a habitual diet (47).",e063cc75-3b0d-491b-b9c4-04a171978d34
23,introduction23," In another long-term follow-up study of an RCT, a personalized low FODMAP diet (LFD) did not result in differences from baseline in the abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacteria (37).  Overall, studies indicate that most patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who respond to low FODMAP diet (LFD) will be able to liberalize their diet if they complete all 3 phases of the low FODMAP diet (LFD) program. Available studies suggest that benefits to overall Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms are durable over an extended follow-up and when dietitian led, have only minor effects on macronutrient/micronutrient intake.  Emerging biomarkers to predict response  Volatile organic compounds.",7420bd49-1939-47bc-b9b3-dc8006134dc2
24,introduction24,"  In an RCT of low FODMAP diet (LFD) vs sham diet, baseline fecal volatile organic compound profiling contained 15 features that classified response to the low FODMAP diet with a mean accuracy of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI), 96%–99%) (50), although no validation study has been reported.  Microbiome markers.  In a 2-day double-blind, crossover, feeding trial in children with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the fecal microbiome of responders was found to be enriched in bacteria known for saccharolytic metabolic capacity (51). Others have also reported a higher abundance of saccharolytic bacteria among low FODMAP diet (LFD) responders in adult patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).",0a740550-2831-403d-984f-d0654a0d0fe6
25,introduction25," In a parallel-group, RCT of 4-week low FODMAP diet (LFD) vs National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) diet in 67 adult patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), nonresponders to low FODMAP diet (LFD) were found to have a higher dysbiosis index score at baseline compared with low FODMAP diet (LFD) responders (52). An open-label 4-week low FODMAP diet (LFD) intervention study reported that 10 of 54 bacterial markers included in a commercially available GA-map Dysbiosis test differed significantly between responders and nonresponders (53). Recently, a pathogenic microbial signature with a decrease in Bacteroidetes spp., an enrichment of Firmicutes spp., and genes fsor carbohydrate metabolism was identified in up to 50% of patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Dietary FODMAP restriction tended to improve this dysbiosis and normalize the metabolic gene pathways (54).",211103d7-35b8-41db-a24d-164761f97fbb
26,introduction26," However, not all studies have found significant differences between the fecal microbial composition of low FODMAP diet (LFD) responders vs nonresponders (55).  Other diet interventions  Several diets for patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are available, and most do not have compelling evidence of effectiveness. A summary of dietary strategies, evidence, and issues is listed in Table 3. In general, 2 approaches have been taken:  Table 3. Dietary strategies for patients with irritable bowel syndrome and their evidence and issues  Holistic dietary plans  These involve recommendations across many food groups and, for some, across eating habits and practices. The major difficulties in investigating such diet plans are that they are not standardized and findings in studies may not be generalizable. It should come as no surprise that controlled evidence for their benefit is generally lacking, although it must be conceded that a lack of evidence neither proves nor disproves benefit.",e925f183-214c-4ffd-80f2-d8c89bedccf7
27,introduction27," Ancient health systems, foreign to modern medicine, such as Indian Ayurveda (56) and Traditional Chinese Medicine (57), implement dietary change to improve health status, including gut symptoms. Ayurvedic dietary approaches were subjected to a randomized, controlled comparison with conventional German nutritional therapy, itself uncertain in efficacy, and showed greater symptomatic improvement in patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (56).  The Mediterranean diet was never designed as a therapeutic diet for Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but it is believed to confer broad health benefits including reduced cardiometabolic risk and all-cause mortality (58). The diet encourages regular meals and is high in olive oil and fiber-rich foods, moderate in fish, dairy, poultry, and eggs, and low in red and processed meats and sweets (58,59).",9d74956e-7073-4975-b81c-e73ea5cc71bf
28,introduction28," It may be beneficial in reducing bowel symptoms due to its positive impact on the gut microbiota and lower intake of saturated fat, proposed to reduce microscopic inflammation and regulation of the gastro-colonic reflex (59–61). The presence of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been associated with low (odds ratio (OR) = 3.24, 85% CI: 1.73–6.08, P < 0.0001) and intermediate (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.14–3.22, P < 0.05) adherences to a Mediterranean diet (60). Lower adherence has been associated with more severe abdominal pain and flatulence in patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (62). In 28 participants with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who trialed 4 weeks each of an low FODMAP diet (LFD), followed by gluten-free and then balanced Mediterranean diet, all 3 diets improved global symptoms (P < 0.01), abdominal pain (P < 0.01), and bloating (P < 0.01) (63).",6f50a1ae-749f-493e-aa9d-7aa1bbdc2f4b
29,introduction29," While low FODMAP diet (LFD) provided superior reductions in bloating, the balanced Mediterranean diet had the highest levels of participant acceptance (63). However, significant methodologic limitations include a lack of randomization, blinding, or assessment of adherence. Therefore, data to date are insufficient to support routine use of the Mediterranean diet in bowel disorders, but the potential for benefit warrants further investigation.  Diets targeting specific food types or components  The pathogenic involvement of low-grade gut inflammation with increased numbers and activation of intraepithelial lymphocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils has stimulated interest in gut-specific hypersensitivity responses to dietary proteins (64). Identification of such proteins could enable personalized dietary recommendations. Three targeting methodologies have been described to date.",44d3cfaf-4898-43b3-8f6a-0abb35253c22
30,introduction30,"  Double-blind placebo-controlled challenges have been unpopular due to their resource intensity and problems with overestimation of cause and effect resulting from the nocebo response, as has been common in gluten challenges (65). Second, proteins with known pathogenic potential can be assessed in patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by withdrawal–rechallenge methodology. Such an approach has been assessed with gluten with the emergence of a new condition of nonceliac gluten or wheat sensitivity. Unfortunately, a gluten-free diet also reduces other potential triggers of gut symptoms, especially fructans, and response to such a dietary trial does not mean that gluten is the cause of symptoms. Indeed, a blinded cross-over rechallenge study in patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who responded to a gluten-free diet indicated fructans rather than gluten as the main culprit for inducing symptoms (66).",7f58c316-5cdc-4a64-9610-45e190d990af
31,introduction31," A biomarker that identifies wheat-related proteins as causally related to symptoms is needed. Third, specific immune reactions to food antigen exposure might better identify problem foods. Gut-specific reactions have been demonstrated in patients with food-related symptoms by the demonstration of IgE and mast cell activation associated with intramucosal injection of food antigens (64) and by the direct observations of injury response using confocal laser endomicroscopy after topical application of specific food antigens to the duodenum and an intramucosal injection of antigens during colonoscopy (67–70). Both methods have provided evidence that dietary restriction of implicated antigens led to clinical benefits for patients. These 2 methods are expensive, invasive, and present technical challenges, but are leading us toward a better understanding of food–Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) relationships.",758fbf36-c23a-4edf-82cc-0e818ac11f0a
32,introduction32," The key question is whether such antigens can be identified in the systemic immune compartment. Standard allergy testing (e.g., skin tests, food-associated IgE, and basophil activation) are not useful but claims that levels of food-related IgG (71) and volumetric responses of leukocytes to the antigens in vitro (72) do identify proteins with pathogenic significance in the gut of patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although interesting, these techniques have not achieved wide acceptance for 2 very important reasons. First, the specificity of the findings to Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and relationship to symptom genesis is not well substantiated, and second, peer-reviewed scientific evaluation of the effect of diets guided by the findings is scarce.  The other target for dietary manipulation is food-associated bioactive chemicals that are naturally occurring or introduced into the food supply. To date, such concepts have received limited scientific evaluation.",0ab5ff79-8c49-490e-a22c-9dd014e8ada5
33,introduction33," A low chemical diet that uses an elimination–rechallenge approach is reported anecdotally to provide benefit but has not been subjected to rigorous scientific evaluation (73). Interest in histamine has been heightened by the increasing evidence of key roles for mast cells in aberrant visceral pain associated with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (64,74). Food is one source of modulating histamine availability, but there are no studies to guide whether such strategies are beneficial. Food-associated salicylates are believed to be one of the more troublesome bioactive food chemicals (75), and a recent pilot cross-over study provided evidence in support (76).  Functional foods  Functional foods are defined as foods that offer health benefits extending beyond basic nutrition. Whole foods or plant derivatives that have been evaluated in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and FC include antraquinones (senna, cascara, aloe, rhubarb) figs, kiwifruit, and prunes.",9d23c6b8-fb5c-49e2-9b4f-9010de1e672e
34,introduction34,"  Anthraquinones are plant-based compounds derived from glycosides that are converted by bacterial glycosidases to poorly absorbed aglycones, which stimulate colonic motility and secretion (77,78). While the potential benefits of senna and cascara in patients with constipation are widely recognized, aloe and rhubarb are less well appreciated for their laxative properties. This is likely related to the paucity of data in patients with these conditions. A meta-analysis that included 3 RCTs and 151 patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) of all subtypes reported a greater improvement in symptom score with Aloe vera vs placebo (standardized mean difference 0.41, P = 0.02 (79)). Another consecutive series of patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-C reported improvements in abdominal symptoms and stool frequency and consistency (80). There are no RCTs evaluating orally ingested rhubarb in patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or FC.",68018dad-114f-4982-ad19-3ad6bd7c8197
35,introduction35," An RCT from China in 374 patients with FC reported that a rhubarb plaster applied to the navel led to significant improvements in stool frequency and consistency (81).  Figs are a rich source of fiber and fructose, which can affect the colonic microbiota, production of short-chain fatty acids, stool consistency, and stool weight, all of which could influence bowel symptoms. A recent RCT from Iran compared rehydrated figs (90 g/d) or flixweed (60 g/d) with placebo for 4 months in 150 patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-C. Both interventions led to significant improvements in stool frequency, stool consistency, and the frequency but not severity of abdominal pain (82).  Kiwifruit come in green, gold, and red varieties and are rich in soluble (pectic polysaccharides) and insoluble (cellulose/hemicellulose) fibers, antioxidants, phytonutrients, and enzymes such as actinidin.",b5834dc4-849e-450c-bf58-959640abc349
36,introduction36," Consequently, kiwifruit has been suggested to affect stool consistency, stool weight, colonic microbiota and short-chain fatty acids, mucosal immune function, and, perhaps, protein digestion (83). Numerous studies have found that 2 peeled kiwifruits per day can significantly improve stool frequency and stool consistency in patients with FC and Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-C and reduce abdominal pain in patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-C (84–86).  Dried plums or prunes are a well-established natural laxative. The basis of such a laxative action may be its content of sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, which acts as an osmotic laxative, and/or its fiber content that includes pectin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Dried apricots also contain sorbitol and fiber, though in smaller quantities than prunes (87).",9f12622e-616f-41e5-8c5c-c013bad484b0
37,introduction37," In RCTs, prunes in doses of 80–120 g/d (100 g = 12 prunes) significantly increase stool frequency and stool weight to a greater degree than placebo or psyllium (6 g/d) in patients with chronic constipation (88,89). In a 4-week, comparative effectiveness trial which enrolled 79 constipated patients from the United States, prunes (100 g/d), kiwifruit (2 fruits/d), and psyllium (12 g/d) led to significant increases in stool frequency compared with those in baseline. Although prunes led to the greatest increase in stool frequency, differences between the interventions were not statistically significant in this pilot study. Adverse events were most common with psyllium and least common with kiwifruit, perhaps because it is low in FODMAP content. At the end of treatment, a smaller percentage of participants were dissatisfied with kiwifruit compared with prunes or psyllium (P < 0.02) (86).  ",2a6fd6c9-d3ed-4eb5-a8a4-32333267616d
38,conclusion0," In the past 10–15 years, diet has assumed an increasingly prominent role in our understanding and treatment of bowel disorders. The low FODMAP diet (LFD) has provided proof of concept for the effectiveness of diet interventions for patients with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Despite its effectiveness, tolerability, acceptability, increased food costs, and nonresponse are all issues that create challenges for patients wanting to implement low FODMAP diet (LFD). For these reasons, research to identify other effective diet interventions for bowel disorders are encouraged and eagerly awaited. As with almost all other aspects of bowel disorders, one size will not fit all patients. Just as restriction of FODMAPs is the beginning and not the end of the 3-phase low FODMAP diet (LFD) plan, we are at the beginning and not the end of the journey to find other evidence-based diet interventions for patients with bowel disorders.",4d609791-e509-443f-b6da-4560d5703b8c
39,conclusion1," Further efforts to discover and validate biomarkers that identify patients who are more or less likely to respond to specific dietary interventions is another aspirational goal that will help us to step away from our current, highly imprecise, empiric treatment model and step toward the enticing concept of personalized nutrition.
