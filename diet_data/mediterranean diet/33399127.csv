1,methods0," 2.1 Study design  This is a randomized controlled trial, with an intervention group that followed a cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) program in Hospital Arnau de Vilanova, and a control group that followed a Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) program in University Hospital La Fe.  Patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) willing to participate were randomly assigned (1:1) to either cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) or Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR). Randomization was performed by an independent statistician. Seven blocks were randomly selected and the assignments were stored in seven packages of 10 closed envelopes. These packages were handed over to the principal investigator, who only opened them after recruitment of a new participant.  Each participant signed an informed consent form before participation and was notified of their group allocation after completing their baseline exercise test after 12 days of hospital discharge.",d6ca575f-1528-41f0-8f49-60577e96be66
2,methods1," Baseline measurements were done at this moment. All assessments were completed at the hospital Arnau de Vilanova. Patients were asked not to disclose their trial group to the faculty, including the investigators involved in questionnaire administration and cardiopulmonary stress testing (cardiopulmonary stress testing (CPET)) evaluations. Visits to primary care physicians and corresponding specialists were not impacted by the trial.  The trial was conducted according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Hospital Arnau de Vilanova and the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (484/14/EC) (Supporting Information Material 1). Each participant signed an informed consent form prior to before participation.

3,methods2,"2 Study population  Patients were recruited by face‐to‐face assessment at discharge after acute coronary syndromes (ACS) between May 28, 2019 and March 10, 2020, when recruitment was stopped due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Patient age was limited to 18–72 years old. All included patients had to meet low‐risk criteria, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%, and have minimum smartphone usage skills. The main exclusion criteria were reduced mobility, pulmonary diseases, neoplasms, or cognitive impairment.  2.3 Control and experimental rehabilitation procedures  Both groups were given the same education. The target heart rate during exercise sessions was 60%–80% of the heart rate reserve based on the baseline treadmill test. During follow‐up, patients were instructed to engage in recommended moderate physical activity guided by Borg's rating of perceived exertion scale of 12–14 (6–20 scale), as well as strength exercises twice a week.",1532284b-2b35-4e6f-98b4-434bf9e294a8
4,methods3," Warm‐up, stretching, and resistance‐band exercises were included in both groups.  2.4 Telerehabilitation group  A portion of hospital training, comprising 2 weeks with four supervised sessions of exercise, was completed. Physical activity consisted of walking down a corridor, adjusting their pace to attain a target heart rate as measured by their smartphone and heart rate monitor (Polar H7). The smartphone application guided participants through a daily exercise and data entry program for 10 months.  2.5 Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) group  The Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) program comprised 2 months of treatment with 16 sessions of supervised exercise. Physical activity consisted of routine workouts and aerobic cycling training.  2.6 Description of the comprehensive monitoring system  The system, designed in cooperation with Trilema Salud (Valencia, Spain), consists of the following elements: 1.",4ac4924b-39b7-4ec7-9833-759c13c59ef3

The healthcare team monitored seven variables based on a traffic light color code and communicated with patients if necessary.  2. A smartphone application that allowed daily scheduling of exercise sessions; recording of subjective general condition, vital signs, and medication adherence; and gave a recommended diet. The exercise module tracked and recorded every exercise session and provided access to warm‐up and stretching videos, a virtual educational classroom, and suggested websites. Access was password‐protected to ensure confidentiality. Technical assistance in the case of sensor/system failure was provided through a call center.  2.7 Outcome measures  The primary outcome was an increase in self‐reported physical activity in MET‐min/week, derived from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) questionnaire.",150cb3a1-7a9c-4a82-a553-46ccf6f64282
6,methods5," The main secondary outcome was an increase in the VO2max. Additional secondary outcomes included other cardiopulmonary stress testing (CPET) measurements, changes in laboratory parameters, anthropometric variables, adherence to the rehabilitation program, returning to work, adherence to a Mediterranean diet, psychological well‐being, health‐related quality of life, and smoking cessation.  2.8 Cardiopulmonary stress test  Symptom‐limited cardiopulmonary stress testing (CPET) was performed after hospital discharge and at 10 months. Stress testing was based on a Bruce protocol using an ergospirometer (Jaeger, MS‐CPX). Heart rate, blood pressure, 12‐lead ECG, and breath‐by‐breath respiratory gas analyses were recorded. The test was assumed to be maximal in case of a respiratory gas exchange ratio (respiratory gas exchange ratio (RER)) > 1.1 or cardiac heart rate >85% of the maximal predicted heart rate. VO2 was defined as the maximal oxygen uptake during the final 30 s of the test.",7a353ec5-18ad-4c27-b787-50761af3bf92
7,methods6," The final cardiopulmonary stress testing (CPET) was performed with or without beta‐blockers, depending on their use at baseline.  2.9 Blood tests and lipid measurements  Blood samples were drawn at baseline and at 4 and 10 months follow‐up and were subsequently analyzed in the hospital laboratory for a standard panel. Medications other than lipid‐lowering therapy were allowed to be modified during the study period. If LDL cholesterol was above 100 mg/dl at 4 months, the treatment was modified, and the patient was excluded from the lipid substudy.  2.10 Body composition and waist circumference  Measurements at baseline, after 4 months of follow‐up, and after 10 months of follow‐up, including weight and visceral fat were assessed using a Tanita BC‐602 scale, Japan. Waist circumference was measured midway between the costal border and the iliac crest.",917323fa-70e4-4a1a-bd6c-bb180f208fa2
8,methods7,"  3 QUESTIONNAIRES  Questionnaires were administered at baseline and at 10 months through computer‐assisted face‐to‐face interviews to obtain higher response rates. The interviewer did not know the patient's rehabilitation group. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) consists of seven questions about physical activity (intense, moderate, or walking) in the last 7 days, as well as the time spent sitting on a weekday. The MET‐minute/week is calculated by multiplying the value of the exercise level (3.3, 4, or 8) by the duration in minutes of the daily activity and by the number of days per week that it is performed. The level of physical exercise can be categorized as low, moderate, or high. 11 , 12  The Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED)) questionnaire includes 14 items.

The reference period was the previous week. 14  The EQ‐5D‐5L questionnaire consists of two parts. The first part measures five aspects of health. The second part is a scale from 0 (worst state of health) to 100 (best state of health). 15  3.1 Sample size  Based on the potential impact of the intervention, a greater increase in total MET‐min/week derived from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) questionnaire in the experimental group was considered plausible. This gave rise to expected mean values 25% higher at the end of rehabilitation for the experimental group (5000 MET‐min/week vs. 4000 for the Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) group) (SD in both groups was considered equal to 1000).",be44b5f1-93fc-4f38-8aa6-2595bbfb028a

A 12% loss to follow‐up was estimated; therefore, 70 patients were planned to be enrolled in the study.  3.2 Statistical analysis  Outcomes were analyzed according to the intention‐to‐treat principle. To analyze treatment effects within groups (at 4 months or 10 months), we used the McNemar–Bowker test of symmetry for qualitative variables (McNemar test for dichotomous variables) or Student's t‐test for paired samples for quantitative variables (Wilcoxon signed‐rank test when parametric assumptions could not be assumed).",78dd5fd7-8522-47dd-b5dc-caa0bc038fa9

26,results18," 7 , 8 , 9  We developed a cardiac telerehabilitation system called Cardioplan, which consists of a web platform and a smartphone application that allows prolonged telemonitoring follow‐up after minimal patient training. To validate this approach, a clinical trial was designed to compare a 10‐month program of telerehabilitation with a conventional 8‐week program of hospital cardiac rehabilitation. In addition to testing a previously unevaluated strategy, this study was conducted during a period of lockdown and restricted social mobility due to the COVID‐19 pandemic and provides additional insight on what telerehabilitation can offer in this situation.  2 ",c52bd5b0-2fec-48d4-9fa2-74427d9aa6a9
27,discussion0,"  Our trial showed that a 10‐month program of cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR), the longest reported intervention, increased physical activity, and oxygen consumption, improved the lipid risk profile, quality of life, and encouraged adherence to the rehabilitation program, compared to a Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) program.  The primary outcome of our cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) participants showed a significant increase in self‐reported physical activity. This result might be related to the longer duration or higher adherence to the program. In a recent statement on home‐based cardiac rehabilitation of the AACVPR/AHA/ACC, Thomas et al. concluded that in at least 20 of the studies reviewed, the effect of cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) on exercise capacity improvement (i.e., peak oxygen uptake) appears to be similar to that observed with Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) when programs last the same length of time.",7eb54f77-65ab-41d7-bbc3-0b6534e30df7
28,discussion1," 18 However, additional 6 months of telerehabilitation after a Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) period increased oxygen consumption and self‐reported physical activity on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) survey, compared to Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) alone. 17 Similarly, our first secondary outcome demonstrated an increase in VO2max from baseline only in the cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) group. In this trial, the app contributed to self‐management and self‐care.  The decrease in the apoB/apoA‐I ratio in the cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) group and the significant increase in non‐HDL cholesterol in the Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) group is of particular significance. In the INTERHEART study, the apoB/apoA‐I ratio was one of the main predictors of acute myocardial infarction and it was the best predictor of coronary events in the in End‐Points Through Aggressive Lipid‐lowering Trial (IDEAL) study.",103beb00-d04f-4f9a-beb3-72b8308b551d
29,discussion2," 19 , 20 In patients treated with statins, elevated apoB and non‐HDL cholesterol are associated with the residual risk of all‐cause mortality and myocardial infarction. 21 The stability of the lipid profile in the cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) group achieved by a nonpharmacological approach could be attributed to increased physical activity, nutritional improvement, or reminders to take medication delivered by the app.  The lower participation of women in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a cause for concern as lower adherence leads to higher mortality. 18 , 22 , 23 , 24 In this study, a reduced delay from discharge to initiating the program in the cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) group could have influenced their higher adherence rates. The longest time to starting rehabilitation in the Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) group was partly due to unforeseen delays in some patients in the scheduled visit to a rehabilitation physician by staff unavailability.",65f7ba96-866a-48e6-a962-50821f5c35dd
30,discussion3," It is possible that this may have led to higher dropout rates in the Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) group.  Conclusions cannot be drawn from such a small number of participants, so further studies should be conducted to confirm if the higher drop‐out rate in Center‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) can be mitigated using a cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) strategy, especially for women.  It has been observed that 67%–93% of patients return to work 2–3 months after acute coronary syndromes (ACS), but this probability decreases for patients aged over 55 years and in women. We found a significant reduction in the return‐to‐work period in the cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) group. This difference could be attributed to a self‐confidence effect, as previously suggested by Reibis et al. 25 These data relating to returning to work are also in agreement with the results observed in the FIT@Home study.",59ba10f1-e10f-49af-9548-3725ff284553

Long‐term monitoring appeared to have a positive effect on behavioral change and self‐confidence level and could have contributed to participants' earlier return to their social and occupational circles, which would merit confirmation in future studies.  Our findings in this field represent a step forward given the superiority of this extended follow‐up strategy, which was also noted in a previous study. 17 Our results show it may be a more effective alternative to conventional rehabilitation, at least in low‐risk patients.",c548d943-a55e-4e51-934b-c730cf300aba
33,discussion6," This new scheme could achieve the hypothetical objective of an 80% inclusion rate of eligible patients, enable an early return to daily life, and make efficient use of health resources.  7 ",32b01364-40aa-4981-99a0-0b1d4df3a56d
34,conclusion0," This study shows that a comprehensive telemonitoring system, with minimal hospital training and follow‐up of at least 10 months, increases physical activity and oxygen consumption; improves the quality of life, emotional well‐being, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet; and ameliorates lipid profile. The program also reduces dropouts and favors the return to work. Therefore, telerehabilitation overcame some barriers of traditional hospital rehabilitation, especially during a pandemic situation. The limited number of subjects prevents the results from being broadly applicable, although they do encourage further multicentre studies.
