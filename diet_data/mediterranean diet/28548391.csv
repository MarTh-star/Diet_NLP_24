Seven samples belonged to the Asteraceae family and one belonged to the Amaranthaceae family. The Greek common names are provided in parentheses. The samples were immediately transferred to the Laboratory of Pharmacognosy and Natural Products Chemistry and botanically characterized. A sample specimen can be found in the herbarium of the laboratory. The fresh clean young leaves and stems were cooked in the traditional method, by boiling with water in an analogy of 500 g of plant material/1 L of water, for approximately 20 min. The decoctions were left to cool at room temperature, then filtered through paper and evaporated to dryness, first with a rotary evaporator (Buchi, Flawil, Switzerland) at 40 °C and then by freeze-drying.",32a746c5-bc9e-4fc7-bb65-f8aeab1bb467
2,methods2," Five of the extracts: Centaurea raphanina, Carthamus lanatus, Crepis sancta, Cichorium endivia, and Cichorium intybus, were enriched using XAD7 HP Amberlite® adsorption resin. For this process, the extract was first diluted in water and the activated resin was added. The solution was stirred for a few hours so that the medium polarity compounds were bound to the resin’s surface. The solution was then filtered through filter paper, and alcohol was added to the residue and the solution was stirred for a few hours. The compounds of interest were released from the resin to the organic solvent, which was then evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator (Buchi). All of the dry extracts were subjected to UPLC-HRMS analysis.  For the isolation of key components from the extracts of Centaurea raphanina, Countercurrent Partition Chromatography was mainly employed.",3021bf43-ee5c-413f-aaa5-3417a7a7ba1c
3,methods3," An Fast Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (FCPC) system with a 200 mL rotor (Rousselet-Robatel, Annonay, France) was used, combined with a Lab Alliance preparative pump and a Buchi B684 fraction collector. For the separation of the Centaurea raphanina decoction (0.91 g), the chosen biphasic system (n-butanol/ethyl acetate/water 4:1:5, 3 L) was prepared prior to analysis in a 5 L separatory funnel, where the two phases were left to separate. The rotor was filled with the lower stationary phase with a flow rate of 10 mL/min, and the system was equilibrated with the passing of the upper mobile phase with a flow rate of 7 mL/min and the rotation set to 1000 rpm. The retention volume of the stationary phase was 112 mL. In total, 121 fractions of 10 mL each were collected in ascending mode, whereas an additional 19 fractions were collected in extrusion mode.

6,methods6," Spectral interpretation was performed using the XcaliburTM (Version 2.2, Thermo Scientific) software.  4.4. DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) Radical Scavenging Assay Free-radical scavenging capacity of the C. spinosum, C. intybus, C. sancta, C. endivia, and S. asper extracts were evaluated using the DPPH radical. The remaining extracts were not tested due to poor solubility. Briefly, a 1.0 mL freshly-made methanolic solution of DPPH radical (100 μΜ) was mixed with tested extract solution at different concentrations (0.5–100 μg/mL). The contents were vigorously mixed, incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 min, and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm. The measurement was conducted on a Hitachi U-1900 radio beam spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). In each experiment, the tested sample alone in methanol was used as blank and DPPH alone in methanol was used as control.",584ffebd-4e74-4af5-acb7-e049134a42d6
7,methods7,"  The percentage of radical scavenging capacity (radical scavenging capacity (RSC)) of the tested extracts was calculated according to the following equation:  radical scavenging capacity (RSC) (%) = [(Acontrol − Asample)/Acontrol] × 100  where Acontrol and Asample are the absorbance values of the control and the test sample, respectively. Moreover, in order to compare the radical scavenging efficiency of the extracts, the IC50 value showing the concentration that caused 50% scavenging of DPPH radical was calculated from the graph plotting radical scavenging capacity (RSC) percentage against extract concentration. All experiments were performed in triplicate on at least two separate occasions.  4.5.

Conclusions Nutritional regimes from Greece are an important branch of the Mediterranean diet, known for its various beneficial health effects. Traditional medicine and chemoprevention knowledge connected with food consumption are being investigated as biological assays and chemical profiling techniques advance, resulting in the gradual elucidation of the role of phytonutrients. In this work, we attempted to clarify and provide insight into the composition of eight semi-wild greens from various families (Cichorium intybus, C. endivia, C.",28d9b8a1-815e-4bee-93ef-6285df92d719

More importantly, we investigated the phytonutrients present in the respective decoctions that are traditionally consumed as health protecting agents. The investigated decoctions, amongst which Centaurea raphanina was unique, were found to be rich in pinocembrin analogues and were correlated with cytotoxic and antioxidant properties. This work contributes to the investigations into the beneficial health properties of the Mediterranean diet and the chemical elucidation of edible plants. ",5da601dd-aa9b-4eb9-a5d5-c30d052b060d
