0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design The present study was a cross-sectional analysis on baseline data within the frame of the PREDIMED-PLUS study, a six-year multicentre, parallel-group, randomised trial conducted in Spain to assess the effect on cardiovascular disease morbimortality of an intensive weight loss intervention programme based on an energy-restricted traditional MedDiet (erMedDiet), physical activity promotion and behavioural support, in comparison with an usual care intervention only with energy-unrestricted MedDiet (control group). Details on the study protocol can be found elsewhere [12] and at http://predimedplus.com/. The trial was registered in 2014 at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial (ISRCT; http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN89898870) with number 89898870.  2.2.",9b1a28f0-943f-4b2f-8ac8-df45e1f0883a
1,methods1," Participants, Recruitment and Randomization Eligible participants were community-dwelling adults (aged 55–75 in men; 60–75 in women), who were overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 and <40 kg/m2) and met at least three criteria for the metabolic syndrome (MetS) according to the updated harmonized criteria of the International Diabetes Federation and the American Heart Association and National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute [13].  From 5 September 2013 to 31 October 2016, a total of 6874 participants were recruited in 23 Spanish centres (universities, hospitals and research institutes).  All participants provided written informed consent, and the study protocol and procedures were approved according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki by all the participating institutions.  2.3.",44bc43c2-c65a-4c8e-a90b-adb1be0b4cc7
2,methods2," Dietary Assessment Registered dietitians collected data on dietary intake at baseline with a semiquantitative 137-item food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)), repeatedly validated in Spain [14]. Detailed information about the development, reproducibility and validity of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in the PREDIMED cohort has been previously reported [15,16]. For each item, a typical portion size was included and consumption frequencies were registered in nine categories that ranged from “never or almost never” to “≥6 times/day”. Energy and nutrient intakes were calculated as frequency multiplied by nutrient composition of specified portion size for each food item, using a computer program based on available information in Spanish food composition tables [17,18,19]. We also considered for the total nutrient intake the average intake of micronutrients from dietary supplements, declared by participants in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).",fce1559b-c03c-4454-b716-b4ed3bb5f08a
3,methods3," Participants reporting extreme total energy intakes (<500 or >3.500 kcal/day in women or <800 or >4.000 kcal/day in men) or outliers for micronutrient intake (at three or more standard deviations (SD) from both sides of the mean) were excluded from the analysis [2]. The final sample in the present study included 6060 subjects (3118 men and 2942 women) who had available data on nutrient intake.  2.4. Determination of Nut Consumption For the purpose of this study, nut consumption was assessed using the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data, and total nut consumption comprised of the following four categories: almonds, pistachios, walnuts, and other nuts. Participants who reported consuming zero quantity of nuts in their food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were classified as ‘non-nut consumers’ (n = 1091), and ‘nut-consumers’ (n = 4969) were participants who reported consuming any quantity of nuts. ‘Nut-consumers’ were also categorized into quintiles (Q1: <4.2 g/day, n = 911; Q2: 4.2–8.",7d2fe822-a5df-4d75-a5e6-2a9d0e00a201
4,methods4,"3 g/day, n = 1058; Q3: 8.4–14.5 g/day, n = 868; Q4: 14.6–29.3, n = 1093; Q5: ≥29.4 g/day, n = 1039).  2.5. Determination of Micronutrients Intake The micronutrients examined were vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, C, A, D, E and folic acid, and Zn, iodine, Se, Fe, Ca, K, P, Mg, and Cr. We used the dietary references intakes (dietary reference intakes (DRI)s) values proposed by Institute of Medicine [17], that are quantitative estimates of nutrient intakes to be used for assessing and planning diets for healthy people and included four different values: estimated average requirements (estimated average requirements (EAR)), recommended daily allowances (recommended daily allowances (RDA)), adequate intake (AI) (i.e., values for nutrients having undetermined recommended daily allowances (RDA)), and tolerable upper level (UL) values.",1f592a94-5008-4c19-b117-8678f0d06de1
5,methods5," We estimated the prevalence of inadequate micronutrients intake according to sex and age by using the estimated average requirements (EAR) cut-point, except for K and Cr intakes, whose prevalence was evaluated based on AI cut-point [18,19].  The carbohydrate (carbohydrate (CHO)) quality index (carbohydrate quality index (CQI)) and the fat quality index (fat quality index (FQI)) were calculated as previously described [2,20]. Briefly, the carbohydrate quality index (CQI) was defined summing up quintiles of the following four criteria: dietary fiber intake (g per day, positively weighted), glycemic index (negatively weighted), ratio whole grains/total grains (positively weighted), and finally, ratio solid carbohydrate (CHO)/(solid carbohydrate (CHO) + liquid carbohydrate (CHO)) (positively weighted). Solid carbohydrate (CHO) intake included all carbohydrate (CHO) containing solid foods, and liquid carbohydrate (CHO) intake included sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice.",a5add6f9-bb73-4588-987f-45e857a56ffd
6,methods6," For each of these four components, we categorized participants into quintiles and received a value (ranging from one to five) according to each quintile (for GI, those in the fifth quintile received one point and those in the first quintile received five points). Finally, we constructed the carbohydrate quality index (CQI) summing all values. All criteria had the same weighting, and the carbohydrate quality index (CQI) ranged from four to 20. On the other hand, the fat quality index (FQI) was calculated using the ratio (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) + polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA))/(saturated fatty acid (SFA) + trans fatty acid [TFA]) as a continuous variable.  Registered dietitians also administered a 17-item Mediterranean dietary questionnaire, a modified version of the previously validated questionnaire used in the PREDIMED trial [21], designed to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet.",ced8cb68-e733-431a-a81f-6e1e2ebbd2b6
7,methods7," Compliance with each of the 17 food habits reflecting a Mediterranean diet was scored with one point, and zero points otherwise. Therefore, a score ranging from 0–17 points, with 0 meaning no adherence and 17 meaning maximum adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean diet score (MedDiet (MDS))) was developed.  2.6. Physical Activity Physical activity was measured using the validated Minnesota-REGICOR short physical activity questionnaire [22,23,24] and the validated Spanish version of the nurses’ health study questionnaire to assess sedentary behaviours [25]. In dietary assessment according to physical activity variables, participants who had not responded to all of the physical activity questionnaires (n = 14) and participants reporting outliers for total physical activity expressed as MET·min/week (at three or more SD from the mean for each sex) were excluded and 5742 participants were included in the analysis (2981 men and 2761 women).  2.7.",9df3c754-9d2a-483e-ad18-3fe8eea164d7
8,methods8," Anthropometric and Blood Pressure Measurements Anthropometric variables were measured by trained personnel according to the PREDIMED-PLUS protocol. Weight and height were measured with high-quality electronic calibrated scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer, respectively. The body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Waist circumference was measured halfway between the last rib and the iliac crest by using an anthropometric tape. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate with a validated semi-automatic oscillometer (Omron HEM-705CP, the Netherlands) after five minutes of rest in-between measurements while the participant was in a seated position. All anthropometric variables were determined in duplicate, except for blood pressure (in triplicate).  2.8.",c59044ac-5a98-4d50-93b1-7fc1a1b83a95
9,methods9," Blood Collection and Analysis Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast and biochemical analyses were performed on fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL))-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in local laboratories using standard enzymatic methods.  2.9. Other Health Variables Information related to individual medical history, current medication use and smoking status were also obtained.  2.10. Statistical Analyses Analyses were performed with the SPSS statistical software package version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data are shown as mean, standard deviation (SD) or, median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)). Difference in means between the two comparison groups were tested by an unpaired Students’ t-test. Differences in means between the quintiles of nut consumption were tested by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test.",a5215074-76fa-4940-8deb-e7ab5dd1a62d
10,methods10," The difference in prevalence across nut consumers and non-nut consumers was examined using χ2 (all p values are two-tailed). We have also defined the cut-off ≥6 and ≥8 unmet dietary reference intakes (DRI) according to the number of nutrients unmet. Thus, six and eight unmet dietary reference intakes (DRI) of all nutrients examined as previously described. Logistic regression analyses with the calculation of corresponding odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to examine the association between unmet dietary reference intakes (DRI) in ≥6 or ≥8 items (dependent variables) and nut consumption (independent variable). Univariate analysis was first carried out for the two different cut-offs (crude OR). Secondly, results were adjusted for sex, energy intake (continuous variable) and physical activity (continuous variable, expressed as MET·min/week) to control for potential confounding.",e0361854-5370-4297-b02e-49f127ea3e25
11,methods11," Thirdly, results were adjusted for sex, energy intake (continuous variable), total fat intake (continuous variable, expressed as % of total energy intake), MedDiet (MDS) (continuous variable) and physical activity (continuous variable, expressed as MET·min/week). Results were considered statistically significant if p-value (two-tailed) <0.05.  3. Results Overall, 82.0% of participants were nut consumers (83.6% of men and 80.3% of women, p = 0.001); the median of nut consumption was 12.6 g/day (interquartile range (IQR): 6.0, 25.2). Table 1 shows the comparison of diet quality and lifestyle characteristics between the two study groups. Nut consumers had higher intakes of energy, solid carbohydrate (CHO), total fat, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), cholesterol and fibre intake, but lower intakes of total carbohydrate (CHO) than non-nut consumers.",86883b2b-fcfe-4f58-bef5-acc8beb6b4f6
12,methods12," No statistically significant differences were found in intakes of liquid carbohydrate (CHO), saturated fatty acid (SFA) and TFA. Usual intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, total fish and total meat were all higher in nut consumers compared with non-nut consumers. Nut consumers had also lower usual intake of dairy products than non-nut consumers. No statistically significant differences were found in usual intake of total cereals, cookies and alcohol between the two comparison groups. Nut consumers had lower glycaemic index and higher carbohydrate quality index (CQI) and fat quality index (FQI) than non-nut consumers. They also had a higher MedDiet (MDS) (even when nuts were not included in the MedDiet (MDS): 7.7 ± 2.6 g/day for non-nut consumers and 8.1 ± 2.5 g/day for not consumers, p < 0.001; data not shown). On the other hand, nut consumers had lower BMI and reported higher total physical activity (expressed as MET·min/week).",57592a53-bbeb-4426-9610-9b62d0cd1db0
13,methods13," Statistically significant differences in smoking habit were also found between the two nut groups. Finally, no statistically significant differences in MetS components were found between the two groups.  Table 2 shows usual intake of vitamins and minerals. Nut consumers had higher intakes of all vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, C, A, D, E and folic acid) and minerals (Zn, Se, Fe, Ca, K, P, Mg, and Cr) examined in the present study, except for iodine. Table 2 also shows that nut consumers were less likely to be below the estimated average requirements (EAR) for vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, C, D, E and folic acid, Ca, Mg, Se and Zn than non-nut consumers.",23da5342-2d22-4bc4-8a2d-e8161d51ecd6
14,methods14," Furthermore, results showed a percent below the estimated average requirements (EAR) equal or below 10% for vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, B12 and C, and P, Fe, Se, Zn and iodine (only in nut consumers); a prevalence between 11 and 20% for vitamin A and Mg in nut consumers, and for iodine in non-nut consumers; a prevalence above 21% for vitamin D, vitamin E, folic acid and Ca in both groups, and for vitamin A and Mg in non-nut consumers. Nut consumers were also more likely to be above the AI for K and Cr than non-nut consumers. No statistically significant differences in vitamin B3, vitamin B12, P or Fe were found between the two groups.  Usual intake of vitamins and minerals of the nut consumers as per quintiles of nut consumption were also assessed (Table 3). Intakes of all vitamins and minerals (except for iodine) increased when increased quintiles of nut consumption.",4a8355de-227b-44fb-b370-d174a83c4bf5
15,methods15," Participants in the highest quintile of nut consumption were less likely to be below the estimated average requirements (EAR) for vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, C, D, E and folic acid, Ca, Mg, and Zn. Participants in the highest quintile of nut consumption were also more likely to be above the AI for K and Cr. No statistically significant differences in vitamins B3 and B12, P, Fe, Se and iodine were found between the quintiles of nut consumption.  Finally, the average number of nutrients for which the dietary reference intakes (DRI)s were unmet was 4.4 (SD: 1.7) in nut-consumers and 5.2 (SD: 2.0) in non-nut consumers (p < 0.001) (difference = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.7, 1.0). Moreover, the average number of nutrients for which the dietary reference intakes (DRI)s were unmet was also lower for participants in the fifth quintile (Q5, n = 1039) of nut consumption (3.6, SD: 1.3) than for participants in the first quintile (Q1, n = 911) of nut consumption (5.0, SD: 1.9) (difference = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2, 1.",87b80448-949f-486e-be63-342bfa79b411
16,methods16,"5) (Figure 1). Nut consumers were also less likely to have unmet dietary reference intakes (DRI) ≥6 and ≥8 than non-nut consumers in crude and multivariable-adjusted analyses (except for dietary reference intakes (DRI) ≥8 analysis when results were adjusted for sex, energy intake, MedDiet (MDS), and physical activity; p = 0.132) (Table 3). The nut consumption median for unmet ≥6 and ≥8 dietary reference intakes (DRI)s was 8.0 (interquartile range (IQR): 4.0, 14.6) in both cases; and for unmet <6 and <8 dietary reference intakes (DRI)s was 12.6 g/day in both cases (interquartile range (IQR): 6.0, 27.4 and 6.0, 25.2, respectively) (Table 4).  4. Discussion In the present study nutrient adequacy and diet quality was better in nut consumers than in non-consumers. This study also confirmed that nut consumption was associated with better adherence to the MedDiet (MedDiet (MDS)) than that observed in their non-consumers counterparts.",70e8fe6b-c2f9-4b89-ae46-5309bef2c5e4
17,methods17," Furthermore, nut consumers had lower BMI [26], were more likely to be physically active and less likely to smoke than non-nut consumers. A novelty of the present study is that it investigated these associations in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk. Moreover, nut consumers (82%) were higher in this study than in previous reports, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2010 (n = 14386; nut consumers: 5.2%) [4], the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001–2010 (n = 24,808; almond consumers: 1.6%) [5] and the New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey (NZANS) 2008/09 (n = 4721; nut consumers: 28.9%) [6]; however, the median of nut consumption was only 12.6 g/day (interquartile range (IQR): 6.0, 25.2).  This study showed that nut consumers were less likely to be below the estimated average requirements (EAR) for some nutrients and above the AI for others than non-nut consumers.",8ef6fb75-cbdf-4751-a0cc-1cd2baaef958
18,methods18," Moreover, higher nut consumers showed better compliance with the nutritional recommendations for micronutrients. Previously, Roman–Viñas et al. [27] analyzed the prevalence of inadequate intakes of several micronutrients (vitamins B12, C, and D; folic acid, Ca, Fe, Se, iodine and Cu) in European adult (19–64 years) and elderly (>64 years) populations. In their study, Roman–Viñas et al. [27] showed a prevalence of inadequacy equal or below 10% for Zn, Fe, and vitamin B12 (only in the elderly population); a prevalence between 11–20% for Cu in the adult and elderly populations, for vitamin B12 in the adult population, and for vitamin C in the elderly Europeans; and a prevalence above 21% for vitamin D, vitamin C (only in the adult population), folic acid, Ca, Se, and iodine [27]. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, only two studies conducted by O’Neil et al.",477597ff-303e-4544-9df5-5050d13542c8
19,methods19," [4,5] using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data have previously examined associations between nut consumption and nutrient adequacy.  O’Neil et al. [4] analyzing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2010 found a lower prevalence of inadequacy for vitamins A, C and E, folate, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn and K in nut-consumers than in non-nut consumers. Lately, O’Neil et al. [5] also examined the prevalence of inadequate intakes of a number of micronutrients between almond and non-almond consumers from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001–2010 and found a lower prevalence of inadequacy for vitamins A, B2, C and E, Ca, Mg, P, Zn and Cu in almond consumers than in non-almond consumers [5]. Accordingly, in our study the prevalence of inadequate intakes of vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, C, D and E, folate, Ca, Mg, Se and Zn were lower in nut consumers than in non-nut consumers.",436ee43b-f06e-4c1f-a00d-fd57b8f03af7
20,methods20,"  Nuts are rich in vitamin E, folate, Ca and Mg, and in our study the proportions of inadequate intakes for these four micronutrients were high, especially in non-nut consumers, in which the proportions with intakes below the estimated average requirements (EAR) were 37–92%, in comparison with nut consumers, in which the proportions were 20–72%. Accordingly, O’Neil et al. [6] also found a high proportion of non-nut consumers with intakes below the estimated average requirements (EAR) for vitamin E, Ca and Mg (i.e., 94.2%, 44.3% and 60.1%, respectively) in comparison with nut consumers (37.7%, 26.9% and 8.2%, respectively). Previously, Serra-Majem et al. [28], assessing the relationship between nutrient adequacy and a posteriori defined Mediterranean and Western dietary pattern in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN)) cohort, also found that 89–94% of participants did not comply with recommended vitamin E intakes.",ab4d79da-3af3-40f3-9b35-b59cfd40863a
21,methods21," Moreover, the proportions of inadequate intakes for folic acid and Mg were also higher in the first quintile of adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (19% and 21%, respectively) than in the fifth quintile (10% and 2%, respectively) [27]. Recently, Zazpe et al. [2] also found an inverse association between the risk of failing to meet ≥4 dietary reference intakes (DRI)s and deciles of adherence to the MedDiet (Mediterranean diet score, MedDiet (MDS)) in participants of the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort.  Most species of nuts have high contents of K (e.g., almonds, pine nuts, pecans). While O’Neil et al. [4,5] studies found a proportion of inadequate intake for K below 12% in both nut and non-nut consumers, in our study the prevalence of inadequacy for K was above 21% in both groups. However, K intake is still below the recommended intakes in our population [17].",7ae027a7-7d21-4c2f-8e94-ff22cc6ed371
22,methods22," Moreover, not only nuts but also fruits, vegetables and dairy products, which were more frequently consumed by nut consumers than non-nut consumers, are high K foods.  Nuts are poor sources of vitamin D. However, in Mediterranean countries, it can be obtained from conversion through the skin stimulated by UV radiation. Therefore, the proportion that should be obtained from food is unknown [1,29]. According to O’Neil’s studies [4,5], its prevalence of inadequacy was also exceptionally very high in both groups (i.e., 86% in nut consumers and 90% in non-nut consumers).  Finally, nut consumers had lower prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intakes (≥6 and ≥8 dietary reference intakes (DRI)), but also higher carbohydrate quality index (CQI), adherence to the MedDiet (Mediterranean diet score, MedDiet (MDS)) and fat quality index (FQI) than non-nut consumers. In this line, Sánchez–Tainta et al.",acddc332-ce4e-44c0-bbc6-4a3ab967d862
23,methods23," [2] have also recently reported lower prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intakes (≥8 dietary reference intakes (DRI)) in the highest quintile of carbohydrate quality index (CQI) or adherence to the MedDiet (Mediterranean Diet Score, MedDiet (MDS)), and in the lowest quintile of fat quality index (FQI). Nevertheless, in Spain there is a general thought that nuts can decrease the cardiovascular risk, and nut consumers may also be more conscious of having a MedDiet. Nevertheless, the median consumption of nuts for which the dietary reference intakes (DRI)s were unmet <6 and <8 was only 12.6 g/day in both cases (interquartile range (IQR): 6.0, 27.4 and 6.0, 25.2, respectively).  5. Strengths and Limitations of the Study The strengths of this study are that it used a large Mediterranean sample at high cardiovascular risk and that, the contribution of supplements to micronutrient intake was considered.",3e1e665c-a3a4-4a86-926c-1450d654edae
24,methods24," The main limitation of this study is that it is a cross-sectional study; thus, we fully acknowledge that causal inferences cannot be drawn but only observations. A second limitation is that all nutritional data presented here is self-reported, as well as most of nutritional assessment methods. Another limitation is that the same source of information was used to assess nut intake and nutritional adequacy. Moreover, the self-reported food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) could overestimate the intake of certain food groups even having been validated. Nevertheless, it is likely to be similar in both compared groups and therefore could only contribute to the increase of the measurement error and to dilute the true differences. Furthermore, in order address such a possible error and avoid information bias we excluded participants with energy or micronutrient intake out of predefined ranges [2].",1cd7cf8b-a962-4920-9139-fb75b15d0f0f
25,methods25," Previously, in the PREDIMED study, 827 participants who had extreme values for total energy intake or any micronutrient intake out of the predefined values were also excluded in the nutritional adequacy analysis [2]. Nonetheless, plasma concentrations of vitamins and micronutrients were not determined in our study. Finally, nut consumers may simply be more health conscious than non-nut consumers [6]. Nevertheless, this is a cross-sectional study and therefore we acknowledge that we are not able to draw causal conclusions but only observations.  6. Conclusions In conclusion, a high proportion of individuals at high cardiovascular risk consumed nuts. The rate was higher than in previous similar studies; however, the average amount of daily nut consumption was low among them. Nevertheless, consumption of nuts was associated with nutrient adequacy, better diet quality, and higher adherence to the MedDiet (Mediterranean diet score, MedDiet (MDS)) than those seen in non-nut consumers.",eadbc9b0-2929-4c9c-92a9-82fba04d1a8e
26,methods26," Nuts contributed to these results and to an overall healthier diet. Thus, consumption of nuts should be encouraged by health professionals, including registered dietitians. Moreover, nutrition education programs that increase awareness, health benefits, and consumption of nuts should be designed for the general adult population at high cardiovascular risk to attain nutrient adequacy. This study also raises the possibility that future research should include a categorized nut consumption amount to assess health benefits in interventional programs encouraging nut consumption.
