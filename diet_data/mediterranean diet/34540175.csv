The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Split, Croatia.  A detailed protocol is described in our previous study [22], which included 155 KTRs, out of which we excluded 56 patients due to a lack of advanced glycation end products (AGE) measurement, 6 patients without CV risk based on advanced glycation end products (AGE), 6 patients that were not on dialysis treatment before kidney transplantation (KTX), and 2 patients with incomplete Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) questionnaires.  2.1.",9dcd5f05-4052-4af8-8e35-9eaf421e2442
1,methods1," Body Composition and Anthropometric Measurement  Body composition was assessed using an MC-780 Multi Frequency Segmental Body Analyzer (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan) for each study participant. The device uses a constant high-frequency current flow and eight electrodes to determine the electrical resistance of different tissues. The method is called bioelectrical impedance analysis (bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)). It is used to assess fat mass (kg), fat mass percentage (%), fat-free mass (kg), visceral fat level, muscle mass (kg), skeletal muscle mass (kg), skeletal muscle mass percentage (%), body mass (kg), phase angle (°) and trunk fat mass (kg). All of the patients were advised not to ingest any food or liquid at least 3 h before the measurement, to urinate just before the measurement, and not to consume alcohol, eat, or drink excessively, or exercise in an excessive way for at least one day before the body composition measurement [42]. Height was measured using a stadiometer.",812a0a12-1d5d-4bc3-8852-0537654b88d6

Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were calculated for each study participant.  2.2. Mediterranean Diet Serving Score  The validated Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS)) questionnaire was used to determine adherence to the MeDi, considering the consumption of different foods and food groups (MeDi components) in time intervals per meal, day or week [43].",795bdbb3-bc6e-42d2-bb6f-9c167ef2b633
3,methods3,"  The food was divided into fourteen food groups, and the points were given according to the new Mediterranean food pyramid in the following way: three points for fruits, vegetables, olive oil, and cereals if consumed with each meal; two points for dairy products and nuts if consumed daily; one point for the recommended number of servings per week is consumed for potatoes (≤3), legumes (≥2), eggs (2–4), fish (≥2), white meat (2), red meat (<2), sweets (≤2), and fermented beverages (1–2 glasses a day) [44].  It sums up to a maximum Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) score of twenty-four (24), and the greater score implies greater adherence to the MeDi. The optimal cut-off point ≥13.50 was set to determine adherence or non-adherence to the MeDi [43].  2.3.",bba76f32-dc84-4bad-bed4-7a63b2125819

7,methods7," Advanced Glycation End Products (advanced glycation end products (AGE)) Measurement  advanced glycation end products (AGE)s were measured on the skin using skin autofluorescence (SAF), a noninvasive desktop device (advanced glycation end products (AGE) Reader mu, Diagnostic’s Technologies BV, Groningen, The Netherlands). skin autofluorescence (SAF) is expressed in arbitrary units (AU) [45].  The device uses a UV-A light-emitting lamp and a built-in spectrometer to calculate skin autofluorescence (SAF) by dividing the excitation light by the emitted light. Before measurement, the skin of a participant’s dominant forearm was cleaned with alcohol and placed on the device. All the measurements were performed on a skin site that had no visible abnormalities. Three consecutive measurements were taken for each study participant, and the mean value of skin autofluorescence (SAF) was calculated.",c777ba24-5fe5-4473-ac15-3d5e2ea98c37
8,methods8," The measured skin autofluorescence (SAF) level was considered together with the age of the participants, and a score was calculated that classified the participants into one of the four groups (none, limited, increased, definite) according to their CV risk [46] using an application provided by the manufacturer. Four groups were then merged into two groups for statistical analysis where none and limited were categorized as mild to moderate CV risk and increased and definite were categorized as severe CV risk.  2.5. Statistical Analyses  After the exclusion of the participants who had missing data, the normality of the variables was checked with the Shapiro–Wilk test. The data were described with median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)) or with mean and standard deviation (SD) based on normality or as numbers with percentages for categorical variables.",e93a8dc9-4ad2-4ed2-a80c-ed4618ce9274
9,methods9," To test if the two groups of participants differed based on advanced glycation end products (AGE) severity, descriptive statistics were performed first using the Mann–Whitney test, t-test, or chi-square test where appropriate. To find the predictors of severe advanced glycation end products (AGE), first, univariate logistic (mild and moderate vs. severe advanced glycation end products (AGE)) and linear (advanced glycation end products (AGE) score) regression analyses were performed. All the variables with a p-value < 0.2 from the univariate regression models were used as input for the LASSO regression models with 10-fold cross-validation. LASSO regression is a modification of a normal regression with penalization, which performs better in situations with smaller sample sizes and where a chance for multicollinearity issues is high. Due to the shrinkage of unimportant coefficients to zero, in LASSO regression, overfitting is avoided, and the model automates feature selection.",26c86d0f-11e2-4083-ab0f-3b92631dd70a

The general characteristics of these patients are summarized in Table 1. In short, KTRs with severe CV risk based on advanced glycation end products (AGE) were significantly older (67 ± 12 years vs. 54 ± 28.5 years; p < 0.001), and more of them were treated with hemodialysis (HD) or combined peritoneal dialysis (PD) and HD prior kidney transplantation (KTX) (80% vs. 42%; p = 0.003), and more of them suffered from chronic kidney disease (CKD) (81% vs. 46%; p = 0.002).",d86c95c5-dfaf-4d59-9e6e-6c9e742383c2
12,methods12," Differences in smoking status according to CV risk categories did not reach a significant level. Two groups of KTRs did not differ in any of the measured anthropometric parameters and based on the examined laboratory parameters, only differed in the levels of urea and eGFR, where KTRs with severe CV risk had increased levels of urea (10.8 ± 4.85 vs. 8 ± 3.47; p = 0.002) and decreased levels of eGFR (39.7 ± 16.55 vs. 61.95 ± 34.43; p = 0.009). When looking at the body composition parameters, we observed that KTRs with severe CV risk had significantly higher metabolic age (53.18 ± 11.25 vs. 46.38 ± 16.07; p = 0.033) and significantly lower phase angle (4.98 ± 0.76 vs. 5.36 ± 0.67; p = 0.036). Finally, two groups of KTRs did not show significantly different patterns in MeDi adherence, as measured through the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) questionnaire; in fact, both groups showed very low adherence to the recommended guidelines (only 12% of all KTRs showed MeDi adherence).",8d775b7e-e407-4521-bfcd-8d7b8c58b72f
13,methods13," KTRs suffering from severe CV risk based on the advanced glycation end products (AGE) values were slightly more adherent (14% vs. 8%); however, this difference was not statistically significant. When observing each food item or food group, the only significant difference was observed in the pattern of adherence to the recommendations of eating sweets, where KTRs with severe CV risk showed better adherence (66% vs. 35%; p = 0.014) (Table 2).  To find the predictors associated with severe CV risk based on the advanced glycation end products (AGE) values in KTRs, we first performed univariate logistic and linear regressions to assess how strongly each variable was independently associated with severe CV risk and higher values of advanced glycation end products (AGE), respectively. The results of these univariate regression models are shown in Supplementary Table S1.",f8b6c5fe-ddad-4d3f-81d4-95ac2cc97735
14,methods14," In both logistic and linear regression, age, the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and levels of urea showed a positive relationship, while levels of eGFR, phase angle, and trunk fat mass showed a negative association with severe CV risk and increased advanced glycation end products (AGE) (p < 0.05). In addition to that, a positive association with severe CV risk was found with dialysis type, metabolic age, and adherence to sweets recommendations (p < 0.05), while an additional positive association with increased advanced glycation end products (AGE) levels was found with years spent on dialysis, the presence of CV disease, levels of C reactive protein (CRP), levels of urate, and adherence to nuts recommendations (p < 0.05). Together with these, all of the variables with p < 0.2 were considered potential predictors and were used in further analyses where we employed logistic and linear LASSO regression models.",4a7ca0ec-590b-4b5b-b0ae-d68c32bcc931
15,methods15," Out of 24 potential predictors, the logistic LASSO regression model selected age (LASSO coefficient 0.098; p = 0.01), dialysis type, presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (LASSO coefficient 1.670; p = 0.017), levels of calcium, levels of C reactive protein (CRP), levels of urea, skeletal muscle mass, trunk fat mass and adherence to cereals, red meat, and sweets recommendations as important predictors of severe CV risk in KTRs based on advanced glycation end products (AGE) (Table 3).  The results of the linear LASSO regression model, of 23 variables input, selected age (LASSO coefficient 0.018; p = 0.005), dialysis type, years spent on dialysis, presence of CVD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (LASSO coefficient 0.435; p = 0.018), levels of C reactive protein (CRP), levels of phosphorus, levels of urate (LASSO coefficient 0.002; p = 0.008), trunk fat mass (LASSO coefficient −0.046; p = 0.",b7825986-3561-470d-9c24-bfc2631589c9

The predictors that are retained as statistically significant in both models are highlighted with the LASSO coefficient and p-value given in the brackets.  Due to an unexpected negative association between increased advanced glycation end products (AGE) and trunk fat mass, we wanted to examine whether this is correlated to the time KTRs have spent on dialysis treatment before kidney transplantation (KTX) or with the time passed since their kidney transplantation (KTX). The correlation results are shown in Supplementary Figures S1–S8. No significant correlation was found between trunk fat mass and time since kidney transplantation (KTX) or time spent on dialysis before kidney transplantation (KTX) when looking at all 85 KTRs (Figures S1 and S4) or those KTRs that were treated with PD (Figures S5 and S6).",a0291fe8-dbba-45f3-9b88-d8ebfc54251d
17,methods17," A weak negative correlation was found when only taking a subset of the KTRs treated with HD (R = −0.32, p = 0.041 for time after kidney transplantation (KTX) (Figure S7); R = −0.29, p = 0.067 for time spent on dialysis (Figure S2)), while a very strong positive correlation was found with a subset of KTRs treated with both PD and HD (R = 0.68, p = 0.010 for time after kidney transplantation (KTX) (Figure S8); R = 0.69, p = 0.011 for time spent on dialysis (Figure S4)).  4. Discussion  Our results showed that age and the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) were the most significant predictors of advanced glycation end products (AGE) in KTRs. Moreover, the duration of dialysis treatment before kidney transplantation (KTX), HD, and the combination of HD/PD were predictive of the advanced glycation end products (AGE) values in our studied population.",e8b7e98d-07c4-47ee-88c1-e844f46955a5
18,methods18," advanced glycation end products (AGE) are known predictors of mortality in dialysis patients [50], and in a previous study of KTRs, eGFR was found to be the most important independent determinant of circulating advanced glycation end products (AGE) [8]. In a study of 189 stable KTRs, advanced glycation end products (AGE) measured by skin autofluorescence (SAF) was positively correlated with age, and KTRs with a history of PD showed lower levels of advanced glycation end products (AGE) than KTRs with a history of HD [7], which is similar to our results.  The presence of CV events in the history of Dalmatian KTRs was also associated with higher levels of advanced glycation end products (AGE). Previous studies reported that advanced glycation end products (AGE) molecules were predictive of CV risk in the general population and in KTRs [51], which is consistent with our results. On the other hand, a study by Calvino et al.",a5c40cab-658e-40e6-8d0a-8ee1d1e6c11c
19,methods19," found no significant association between the history of CV events and advanced glycation end products (AGE) in this population of patients [7]. advanced glycation end products (AGE) molecules have been associated with elevated CV risk in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD). Underlying mechanisms lead to the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) in tissues, which then cross-link with collagen or elastin molecules, resulting in elevated arterial stiffness [52]. skin autofluorescence (SAF)-measured advanced glycation end products (AGE) was associated with higher carotid intima-media thickness and inversely correlated with endothelial progenitor cells in 212 HD patients, as observed by Ueno et al. [53]  Our results confirm the usefulness of the skin autofluorescence (SAF)-measured advanced glycation end products (AGE) method, indicating an increased CV risk in this patient population.",2fb8a478-8564-410d-9e81-97a64d22f12e
20,methods20," Regarding the laboratory parameters, our results suggest positive associations between C reactive protein (CRP), urate, and urea levels with advanced glycation end products (AGE). Similar results regarding C reactive protein (CRP) and advanced glycation end products (AGE) measured by skin autofluorescence (SAF) associations were found in a study by Hartog et al. [54]. A study on type 2 diabetes patients also found positive associations between advanced glycation end products (AGE) and uric acid levels [55]. These results suggest the influence of inflammatory and nitrogen excretion products on the levels of advanced glycation end products (AGE).  The results of our final regression model also suggest an inverse relationship between serum calcium and phosphate levels and skin autofluorescence (SAF) advanced glycation end products (AGE) in KTRs.  Hyperphosphatemia is known to be a predictor of worse outcomes in KTRs [56]. A study of KTRs by Calvino et al.",461fbde6-a323-48e0-917e-409c15d10920
21,methods21," found a positive correlation between skin autofluorescence (SAF) and phosphate, which is in contrast to our findings [7]. Phosphate entering vascular smooth muscle cells causes vascular calcification, which in turn increases vascular stiffness and increases the risk of fatal CV events [57]. Higher phosphate levels in the intracellular compartment of vascular smooth muscle cells could explain the inverse relationship we found between serum phosphate levels and advanced glycation end products (AGE).  Calcium is a well-described and extremely important ion involved in the response to various oxidants. It is known that an increase in the level of calcium in the cytoplasm of different cells occurs as a result of different oxidants [58]. This may explain why lower extracellular levels are associated with higher advanced glycation end products (AGE) levels in Dalmatian KTRs since advanced glycation end products (AGE) molecules are markers of oxidative stress. A study by Calvino et al.",76a4496e-4460-402c-a946-a89ac1e1d737
22,methods22," found no significant associations between advanced glycation end products (AGE) and calcium in KTRs [7].  Regarding body composition, our results are somewhat contradictory. Indeed, our final regression model suggests an inverse relationship between trunk fat mass content and advanced glycation end products (AGE), while at the same time, there is a reciprocal relationship between the percentage of skeletal muscle and advanced glycation end products (AGE) in Dalmatian KTRs. A study from Calvino on 189 stable KTRs found negative correlations between skin autofluorescence (SAF)-measured advanced glycation end products (AGE) and dynamometry [7], and the results from Silva et al. [59] found no associations between advanced glycation end products (AGE) and muscle strength in HD patients, while our results suggest differently, suggesting that skeletal muscle mass percentage is a positive predictor of advanced glycation end products (AGE) in KTRs.",a4dd40a3-eaa2-4bea-8c3e-9c0b064ea963
23,methods23," In a prospective cohort study of 592 healthy volunteers by Semba et al., fat mass was inversely associated with serum carboxymethyl lysine, a major circulating advanced glycation end products (AGE), considering the possibility that advanced glycation end products (AGE) is stored in adipose tissue [28].  It is known that visceral fat is a protective factor in end-stage renal disease patients on maintenance HD, which is referred to as reverse epidemiology [60]. Moreover, it is well known that several traditional risk factors for CV disease in the general population, such as arterial hypertension, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia, are predictive of CV disease development in chronic kidney disease (CKD), whereas a reverse effect is observed in those patients treated with dialysis. In dialysis patients, lower blood pressure, lower Body mass index (BMI), and lower serum cholesterol levels appear to be independent risk factors for CV disease.",3a1ec09e-9dfd-4ebb-80b4-f045d23d9898
24,methods24," In some cases, a reversal back to traditional epidemiology has been described after successful kidney transplantation (KTX). More trials are needed to address whether modification of traditional and nontraditional CV risk factors can reduce the risk of CV disease in KTRs [61].  Because this is the first study to use the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) method to analyze body composition and advanced glycation end products (AGE) in KTRs, and we have no other evidence to address this question, could it be that visceral fat favors the lower skin autofluorescence (SAF) advanced glycation end products (AGE) levels in KTRs? Considering the relatively small number of participants and all of the limitations resulting from the cross-sectional design of our study, we highlight an area that should be further investigated with a prospective study design in this population of patients.",74643a08-b8ff-46f0-a8ca-8d8ed9a813cb
25,methods25,"  Regarding adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the results of our final regression model showed no associations between Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) score and advanced glycation end products (AGE). However, adherence to specific foods and food groups showed associations with advanced glycation end products (AGE) in KTRs. For example, adherence to MeDi that recommended cereal intake at each meal showed an inverse association with advanced glycation end products (AGE). The consumption of sweets two or fewer times per week, the consumption of red meat less than two times per week, and the daily consumption of nuts, as recommended by MeDi, showed reciprocal associations with advanced glycation end products (AGE) in Dalmatian KTRs. This is quite contradictory because red meat, sweets, and nuts are foods naturally rich in advanced glycation end products (AGE) [62]. It is important to note that we did not consider food preparation methods.",921aa7be-5d20-4826-8340-2e1aac801686
26,methods26," For example, it has been studied that boiling or stewing meat results in more than twice the reduction in advanced glycation end products (AGE) levels than broiling the same piece of meat [62]. DeChristopher’s review suggests that the source of elevated N-3 carboxymethyl lysine, a well-studied marker of advanced glycation end products (AGE) formation, may not be dietary but rather intestinal [63].  The results of our logistic/linear regression presented in Table S1 show associations between the phase angle and the duration of dialysis before kidney transplantation (KTX) with advanced glycation end products (AGE). The phase angle is known to be a predictor of sarcopenia [64] and mortality in KTRs [65], and advanced glycation end products (AGE), together with malnutrition, is a predictor of mortality in dialysis patients [50]. In a study by Hartog et al.",c6112a02-c4ce-44f1-94c7-e5217def39a7
27,methods27," on a KTR population, the duration of pre-transplant dialysis was also associated with advanced glycation end products (AGE) measured by skin autofluorescence (SAF) [54]. These findings may suggest an interplay between oxidative stress, sarcopenia, and the duration of dialysis treatment in KTRs, but further studies in a prospective design are needed to better explain this issue.  This study has some limitations, primarily resulting from the cross-sectional design, which prevented us from detecting causal associations. In addition, we included a relatively small but a representative number of participants because of the specificity of the target population. We did not consider food preparation type, although we used a validated Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) questionnaire that considers food type but not portion sizes and food preparation type.",0cf32d92-86b1-4324-a558-66ce2184db20
28,methods28," Another limitation regarding the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) questionnaire could be a recall bias together with a low percentage of MeDi adherent KTRs, and regarding measurements with the advanced glycation end products (AGE) reader, although it is a validated device and an experienced investigator performed the measurements for three consecutive times, measurement error could have happened. We did not take physical activity into consideration when conducting this study, unfortunately. The strengths of our study are the representativeness of the study population and the innovative study objective for this population of patients.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, the results of this cross-sectional study showed a high proportion of KTRs with high CV risk determined by advanced glycation end products (AGE) measured by skin autofluorescence (SAF).",520d3f3d-b620-4251-813e-df7802a547ce
29,methods29," Furthermore, the duration and type of dialysis treatment prior to kidney transplantation (KTX), the history of CV disease and the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), together with the inflammation and nitrogen excretion parameters, showed significant associations with advanced glycation end products (AGE) in KTRs. Additionally, we also found that elements of nutritional status and MeDi adherence were important predictors for increased levels of advanced glycation end products (AGE) in this patient population. Finally, studies with a larger number of participants in a prospective design should be designed to investigate other potential factors contributing to advanced glycation end products (AGE) levels in KTRs.",c1bc6ed4-f34b-4876-a84c-12a79ddb0320
30,methods30,"  This is the first study to elaborate on the dietary pattern, body composition, and advanced glycation end products (AGE) in KTRs with a focus on CV risk according to advanced glycation end products (AGE) value, which introduces additional knowledge into a field of untraditional CV risk factors and demonstrates a direction for adequate nutritional care in KTRs. Lifestyle modifications in KTRs should be considered for further investigation and clinical practice. ",9d1ccab7-a174-4218-8e0a-0ac5e8b97b60
