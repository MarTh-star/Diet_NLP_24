0,methods0,"2.1. Subjects and Design This research presents a non-experimental, descriptive and cross-sectional design. The sample consisted of 1059 adolescents from the province of Granada (Spain). Participants were aged between 14 and 16 years old (x¯ = 15.23, SD = 1.08), 49.4% (n = 527) male and 50.6% (n = 532) female. Participating centres came from both public and private sectors. There was a total of 40,821 high school students from the province of Granada in the academic year 2017–2018. A total of 17,283 students who studied in the third and fourth years of this educational stage were considered in the research. Finally, a total of 1322 adolescents were selected by convenience, considering the educational centres that accepted to participate in this study and the selection criteria ((1) regularly attend to high school; (2) do not repeat course; (3) do not suffer from important pathologies). The final sample consisted of 1059 subjects.",0b1fa4f4-a0af-48d9-b59c-f9f472bff1f6
1,methods1," A total of 263 questionnaires had to be eliminated because they were completed incorrectly (Figure 1).  2.2. Instruments Test of Adherence to Mediterranean Diet (KIDMED) [35]. This questionnaire is composed of 16 dichotomous items related to Mediterranean diet components offering a yes-no response; e.g., “You eat fresh or cooked vegetables every day”. Four of these items were negatively framed (−1) and twelve were positively framed (+1). Potential overall scores ranged from −4 to +12. The KIDMED has demonstrate internal consistency of α = 0.86.  Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A). The PAQ-A has been validated by Kowalski et al. [36] and translated into Spanish by Martínez-Gómez et al. [37]. Respondents self-report their engagement in PA as well as the type of PA engaged in during the prior seven days. The scale provides 10 items scored on a five-point Likert scale; e.g., “In the last seven days what did you usually do at lunchtime (before and after eating)”.",9754a343-b5f3-4a11-abe1-1bcdba3b0e01
2,methods2," All items are summed to provide a total score. The scale has demonstrated adequate reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha of α = 0.89.  Motivation and Learning Strategies Questionnaire-Short Form (MLSQ-SF). The MLSQ-SF has been validated by Pintrich et al. [38] and adapted to a short version of 40 items by Sabogal et al [39]. It consists of 40 items which are scored on a 5-points Likert scale (1 = Never and 5 = Always); e.g., “I strive academically even if I do not like what I do”. The items are grouped into 8 dimensions: value of task, anxiety, elaboration strategies, organizational strategies, critical thinking, self-regulation, time and study habits, self-regulation of effort, and intrinsic orientated goals. This instrument develops internal consistency of α = 0.94.  2.3. Procedure Ethic approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of the University of Granada (reference: 641/CEIH/2018).",e89d98cd-b3b9-4939-8ade-57f8f47305c6
3,methods3," The Department of Didactics of Musical, Plastic and Corporal Expression of the University of Granada sent information packs to invite education centres to participate. After the centres expressed interest to participate, information packs with full study details were provided to legal guardians of potential participants to provide informed consent.  Data was collected during school hours before the start of normal lessons. Participants were instructed on how to complete the questionnaires and a research assistant was on hand to provide guidance and resolve queries. No incentives were provided to participants. We have to point out that this research study has followed the ethical principles for research established by the Declaration of Helsinki. The participants’ right to confidentiality has also been respected.   2.4. Data Analysis The software IBM SPSS® 22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis.",aea95eeb-af8f-4255-8242-538815d39ac1
4,methods4," Frequencies and medians were used to describe the included variables. Associations between variables were analyzed using t-tests for independent samples, ANOVA and bivariate Pearson correlations. Normality of the data was analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Lillieforts’ correction. Levene’s test was employed to check homoscedasticity. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used to analyze internal reliability of all included instruments. The reliability index was established at 95.5%. The significance level was set at 0.05 [40].  3. Results Table 1 shows the characteristics of the sample under study. It was obtained a gender representation of 49.4% (n = 527) for males and 50.6% (n = 532), while the distribution of the sample according to the type of centre was 63.8% (n = 675) for public high-schools and a 36.2% (n = 384) for private centres. In addition, a 20.7% (n = 219) of adolescents lived in rural areas and a 79.3% (n = 840) lived in urban areas. It was observed that 51.",38c9d6dd-980f-4de2-a6eb-2e5fd1cb7108

Further, anxiety was positively related to all dimensions of the motivation and learning strategies questionnaire while the value of task dimension was positively related with all other dimensions. Finally, all the other dimensions of this instrument were positively related.  4. Discussion Several studies have shown the potential effects of a healthy diet and exercise on academic performance, highlighting the potential role of these behaviours for motivation and learning strategies. The main objective of the present research was to identify the existing relationships between dietary habits and engagement with PA in adolescents. A further objective was to analyse the associations between these healthy habits and different elements of motivation and learning, such as intrinsic motivation, anxiety, critical thinking, self-regulation and study habits. Previous studies have also called for further research in this area. e.g.",a16aa721-a38e-4aeb-add1-92084cd35b8e
6,methods10,", Martínez-Lapiscina et al. [29], Erickson et al. [30], Santomauro et al. [41], Godoy et al. [42] and Chacón et al. [43].  Engagement in more than three hours a week of PA was related to a higher quality diet, characterised by a higher intake of cereals, fruit, dairy products, vegetables, fish and nuts. Similarly, the most highly active adolescents also reported consuming fewer processed products, although they also reported a higher consumption of sweets. Indeed, engagement in daily physical activity was associated with higher levels of overall adherence to MD. Research conducted by Kelishadi et al. [44] shows that the higher energy expenditure of active young people necessitates higher intakes of essential nutrients, which requires a higher consumption of carbohydrates, vitamins and quality proteins. This at least partly explains the positive relationship between MD and PA.",e2c59ee2-478b-4069-9fe0-48988a11a546
7,methods11," Furthermore, family influences and contextual factors such as the school environment and the influence of peer groups often result in the clustering of behavioural habits meaning s that adolescents who follow a more active lifestyle tend to develop other healthy habits such as consuming a healthy diet [45,46,47].  It was observed that adolescents who reported a greater adherence to a MD also reported higher scores for elaboration and organization strategies, critical thinking and study habits. Following a healthier diet was also related to a greater capacity for effort, self-regulation and setting intrinsically oriented goals. Indeed, adequate nutrition has been found to positively influence cognitive capacity [48]. It has been demonstrated that higher adherence to Mediterranean diet is associated with higher intake of dietary polyphenols, which in turn are inversely associated with depression and cognitive decline.",c4757745-2bac-4701-93e7-5c8d0c73e897
8,methods12," Higher polyphenol intake decreases systematic inflammation and the level of oxidative stress, therefore, possibly improving cognitive function [30]. In addition, the intake of phospholipids is essential for maintaining electrical potential of the membranes of neuronal cells and enabling memory formation. Moreover, the intake of fatty acids, such as omega-3, a prevalent acid in the MD, reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, acting as a protective factor against cognitive deterioration and improving cerebral blood flow [48,49,50].  Another explanation of the benefits of the MD regarding learning strategies and cognitive performance lies in the importance of avoiding prolonged fasting, something proposed in the MD model [14]. Indeed, a typical MD recommends consuming five daily meals with an even balance of macronutrients in order to maintain blood glucose levels and improve attention and memory capacity [51].",71d47b17-ef11-4ec0-b264-ea0492041f58
9,methods13," Similarly, it is equally important to reduce the consumption of refined sugars in order to decrease postprandial memory, which has the potential to impede study habits and effort capacity [52]. It has also been shown that a healthy diet relates to higher levels of perceived well-being, which can help to encourage self-determined behaviors towards academic work, reduce levels of anxiety, and improve the self-regulation capacity in situations of stress related to the school environment [10,28,53].  There was a positive relationship between PA, motivation and learning strategies. Specifically, it was shown that engaging in an active lifestyle decreased academic anxiety and improved self-regulation. In addition, results revealed that adolescents who engaged in more PA spent more time studying, reported a higher critical thinking score and were more likely to set intrinsically oriented goals. These findings can have partially explained by research conducted previously. Stubbs et al.",f516a83b-c869-4c26-ae15-dedd860a4995
10,methods14," [21] and Rebar et al. [54] have discussed the release of endorphins and the increase in self-confidence following exercise which helps to free the mind of stressors and control depression and anxiety states. Likewise, engaging in PA hedonistically is associated with positive perceptions of personal well-being and feelings of self-determination. Self-regulation and intrinsic motivation towards PA should, therefore, be encouraged [25,55]. In combination with the aforementioned physiological responses to physical activity, these factors explain the greater longevity of participation in research studies of physically active adolescents [17,33,56].  A direct relationship was revealed between intrinsically oriented goals, learning strategies, critical thinking, study habits and self-regulation. Moreover, the task value dimension and anxiety were inversely related to the other measured variables.",7f7f973f-1851-493a-b010-68dcfdb1004b
11,methods15," This finding can be explained by the negative state generated by stressors experienced in the academic context which diminish the capacity for attention and self-regulation of young people. In this context young people may believe themselves to be unable to overcome challenges, diminishing their motivation to maintain focus on educational materials [57,58]. It is, therefore, essential to promote self-determined motivations which improve the capacity for self-regulation and attention, enabling better cognitive and academic performance. In this regard, physical activity and healthy dietary patterns are elements which favour the avoidance of anxiety and the achievement of academic success.  The present research had the following limitations. Firstly, the study employed a descriptive and cross-sectional design which provides useful information on this novel topic but precludes casual conclusions from being made.",b563618a-76c4-48a5-894b-18d00e4feedc
12,methods16," Secondly, the sampling strategy used, followed recommendations of Merino-Marban et al. [40]. Nevertheless, it may have been more interesting to have performed a stratified random sampling procedure using the various areas of the province of Granada as the unit of randomisation. Another limitation lies in the variables employed, because although these are valid to fulfil the objectives of the study, it would have been interesting to include others of great relevance such as the body mass index or the total energy intake/day. This would allow to deepen more in the relationship between the motivations in the learning process, the alimentary habits and the state of health. Finally, whilst significant relationships were elaborated for the MD, PA, and dimensions of the MLSQ-SF, the strength of correlations were generally low. With these limitations taken into consideration, the following suggestions can be made for future research.",f97597df-621c-4ecf-9011-1fcc3917c107
13,methods17," The present study should be replicated and expanded within other samples and examining further variables, such as academic performance based on school grades. In addition, it would be interesting to develop an intervention program in order to verify the combined effect of MD and PA on the cognition and academic performance of adolescents.  5. Conclusions The main conclusions from the present research highlight the importance of better dietary patterns and high adherence to a MD, particularly through a higher consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish, cereals and nuts. Moreover, a number of dimensions of motivation and learning strategies were positively associated with these healthy behaviors. Adolescents who followed a high-quality diet reported higher scores for organizational strategies, self-regulation, critical thinking, effort, study habits and intrinsically oriented goals, in addition to lower anxiety linked to academic contexts.",c0324f63-37c9-48a9-a5db-37ad59066f72
14,methods18," The importance of promoting healthy dietary and physical activity habits is emphasised given identified physical, cognitive and academic benefits. Intervention programs targeted these behaviours within older children and adolescents should be a key priority for health and productivity.
