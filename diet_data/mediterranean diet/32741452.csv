0,introduction0," Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) and physical activity (PA) in adolescence represent powerful indicators of healthy lifestyles in adulthood (1–3).  The MD, characterized by a high intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, dairy products, and nuts, a moderate intake of fish and poultry, along with a low intake of red meat, processed foods, and saturated lipids (4), has been accepted as one of the healthiest dietary patterns in the world (5). The inverse association between the MD adherence and a wide range of chronic and metabolic diseases is well-known (6), and it may be, at least in part, attributed to the anti-inflammatory properties of MD components (7). For instance, it has been reported that low adherence to the MD is directly associated with a worse profile of circulating inflammation-related biomarkers (8).",9bf23714-44a6-4620-989a-fdf02e5e0cb8
1,introduction1," Although, the relationship between MD and inflammatory markers within a population of European adolescents has been recently investigated (9), the impact of MD and PA on inflammatory status in healthy adolescents remains to be clarified.  The spectrum of PA is broad, ranging from physical inactivity/sedentary behavior to different levels of PA intensities. Particularly, the sedentary behavior has been reported to be implicated in unhealthy conditions (10), while moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA during adolescence leads to chronic disease benefits that can be attributed to the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise (11–14).  Over the last years, the impact of PA on inflammation has received great attention for the identification of biologically active substances, secreted by myocytes (myokines) after skeletal muscle contraction, which can exert beneficial influence on systemic inflammatory responses, and to have positive health effects (15, 16).",22be4795-f803-4130-b366-d788a5298af3
2,introduction2," It has been widely recognized that among myokines interleukin (IL)-6 is locally produced in working skeletal muscle in larger amounts than any other cytokines, and it can account for the increase in plasma IL-6 during exercise (17). Muscle-derived IL-6, along with other classical pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (tumor necrosis factor (TNF))-α and IL-1β, is accompanied by the secretion of other cytokines, such as IL-10, which can create an anti-inflammatory environment (18–20).  Convincing evidence indicates the need to promote healthy nutrition and PA to achieve benefits in terms of the prevention of risk factors for metabolic and chronic diseases. In this context, a carefully designed nutrition education program (nutrition education program (NEP)) aiming to enhance the knowledge of the MD principles for empowering adolescents toward healthy dietary habits may represent a useful tool to ensure a better quality of life in adulthood.",c82c7d4b-e1ea-4c25-99bd-1c1642367d41
3,introduction3,"  Thus, the aim of this longitudinal study was to assess over a 6-month period the impact of nutrition education program (NEP) and PA on MD adherence and on inflammatory status in a cohort of healthy adolescents of a Mediterranean area.  ",7067d685-9780-40fe-a6b4-c8ef3a52d4d1
4,methods0," Study Population  The DIMENU (Dieta Mediterranea & Nuoto) project was funded by the EU Regional Operational Programme Calabria, Italy (prot. #52243/2017), for investigating the impact of the adherence of MD and PA on health status in a sample of adolescents from Southern Italy. Based on an in-depth collaboration with the public high school “Istituto Istruzione Superiore”—Castrolibero, and three swim and sport centers (sports club in Cosenza, Paola, and Crotone of Calabria Region, Italy), we were able to recruit and to select sedentary adolescents and subjects performing recreational sport activities or competitive sports, between December 2018 and January 2019 (21). The exclusion criteria were cognitive or physical/motor limitation, health-related problems, use of medications, restrictive diet (i.e., hypocaloric, low carbohydrate, and low fat). All participants and their parents received a detailed explanation of study purposes.",70dfbcc6-0ca0-4e13-9a79-171618b4b7a7
5,methods1," Prior to the enrolment of adolescents in the DIMENU trial, their parents provided written informed consent. All adolescents were subjected to study visits and data collection at baseline (T0) in which the nutrition education program (NEP) on MD-related issues and sports nutrition was also included. This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethic Committee of the University of Calabria, Italy (#5727/2018).  Nutritional History Assessment and Nutrition Education Sessions  To collect the nutritional and medical history, participants were orally interviewed at baseline and after 6 months by a team of nutritionists through a nutritional history record, as previously reported (21). Using the KIDMED test (4, 22), we assessed the adherence to the MD in the study population.",4f1f98ef-be0b-4943-8660-60a3bd8b06d8
6,methods2," The score of MD adherence, ranging from 0 to 12, was based on a 16-point paper questionnaire in which a value of +1 was assigned for the consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, whole cereals or grain, nuts, oil, dairy products, and yogurt and a negative value −1 for skipping breakfast, consumption of baked goods, sweets, and going to fast food. At baseline, two 30/40-min education sessions, consisting of seminars and interactive lectures structured to cover knowledge of food sources of macro- and micronutrients included in the healthy eating pattern and benefits of MD (basic nutrition concepts, eat at regular intervals, maintain adequate hydration, healthy food choices), were provided for all participants by study nutritionists (EA, AG, GC, EM, and SF) and by three endocrinologists (DB, SA, and SC). In addition, we have created an official website of DIMENU project (https://www.dimenu.it/) (23) and a Facebook page (https://www.facebook.",51460cf1-0a21-4bdf-afb7-32ca991b377b
7,methods3,"com/dimenu2019) (24) as innovative ways for assuring additional support and information on MD-related issues to all participants.  Physical Activity Intensity Levels  The intensity of PA levels was estimated following WHO recommendations (25) as physical inactivity [<3 metabolic equivalents (METs)], moderate-intensity (3–6 METs), and vigorous-intensity PA (>6 METs). Specifically, using a questionnaire to assess PA habits that we have described elsewhere (21), the enrolled adolescents were classified into three groups: physical inactivity (PAi = 23), moderate-intensity PA (Pam = 34) [subjects performing at least 60min daily of bicycling (n = 2), dancing (n = 2), brisk walking (n = 2), gymnastics (n = 4), aquatic aerobics (n = 3), recreational swimming (n = 21)] and vigorousintensity PA (PAv = 28) [subjects engaged in at least 60 min daily of jogging or running (n = 2), boxing (n = 1), tennis (n = 1), soccer (n = 2), basketball (n = 2), squash (n = 1), swimming (n = 16),",a0091f90-d757-45f6-820e-11f01e850ad0
8,methods4," aerobic dancing (n = 2), and volleyball (n = 1)]. The same PA intensity levels of adolescents were confirmed through the interview at T1.  Anthropometric Parameters and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis  A detailed description of the anthropometric measurements and bio-impedentiometric analysis (bio impedentiometric analysis (BIA)) performed has been reported elsewhere (21). bio impedentiometric analysis (BIA) estimated phase angle (PhA), total body water (total body water (TBW)), body cell mass (body cell mass (BCM)), fat-free mass (fat free mass (FFM)), and fat mass (FM). Data obtained by bio impedentiometric analysis (BIA) test were analyzed using version 1.2.2.8. of the software Bodygram Plus (Akern Srl; Florence, Italy).  Biochemical Measurements, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, and Interleukin Assays  In the detailed explanation of study purposes, participants were informed to have not eaten at least for 8 h before blood collection.",1733e381-c94f-49d6-bbfc-e9e2cb48aee5
9,methods5," Additionally, participants were reminded 1 week before the study visit. Venous blood samples were collected at T0 and T1, and in order to obtain serum, samples were centrifuged as previously reported (21). erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was measured by Wintrobe method. Serum C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) levels were detected by immunonephelometry (GOLDSITE Diagnostics, Inc., Shenzhen, China). Serum ferritin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) (Monobind Inc., Lake Forest, CA, United States), with a detection sensitivity limit of 0.17 ng/ml. Serum iron was determined on a Konelab 20i Chemistry Analyzer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Vantaa, Finland) according to the standardized procedures (Method Iron “Ferene S,” Sclavo Diagnostics, Siena, Italy).",a3f24cc3-98ee-4652-901d-1dbf3de753ad
10,methods6," Quantification of interleukins was performed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for human IL-6, human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, human IL-1β, and human IL-10 (Merck Life Sciences, Darmstadt, Germany). The respective sensitivities of these assays were 1.6 pg/ml for IL-6, 0.2 pg/ml for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, 0.2 pg/ml for IL-1β, and 2 pg/ml for IL-10.  Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan  All participants received a personalized MD meal plan according to their different PA intensity levels. During the entire period of the nutrition education program (NEP), the nutritionists gave verbal and written dietary instructions on the choice of typical Mediterranean foods. The dietary approach was based on the MD pattern according to the last guidelines (26, 27).",5cb3c27e-91da-480b-a233-a133da164698
11,methods7," Each diet plan provides 15–20% of calories through protein, 45–60% of calories through carbohydrates, and 25–30% of calories through fat, with the respective distribution of macro- and micronutrients according to the different energy expenditure of each subject. We calculated the total daily energy expenditure (total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)) using the formula: total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) = Basal Metabolic Rate × Physical Activity Level, as recommended by the Italian Society of Human Nutrition (https://sinu.it/2019/07/09/fabbisogno-energetico-medio-ar-nellintervallo-deta-1-17-anni/) (28). Meals included an abundance of plant food (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes); fish, poultry, and eggs in moderate amounts; olive oil as the primary source of fat; low consumption of red meats, saturated fats, and sweets. Meals and food plans were designed using MetaDieta software version 4.2.1. (Meteda S.r.l, Roma, Italy).",60750fb4-daab-4e04-ac7f-a9c070185f88

Frequencies (%) were used to describe qualitative variables that were graphically represented in radar plots. McNemar's chi-squared test was applied to evaluate the statistical differences. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used to test for significant differences between KIDMED score with respect to nutrition education program (NEP) and PA and for their interaction. Spearman's correlation test was used to assess the association between variables. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test the association between dependent variables (KIDMED, ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), and cytokines) and independent variables such as nutrition education program (NEP) and PA along with a set of anthropometric parameters to improve the robustness of our analyses.",43aa0ef3-6edf-4f10-8915-7fbe1daf4d49

Based on the KIDMED values, we divided the population into optimal (score ≥8), medium (score 4–7), and poor (score ≤ 3) adherence to the MD (22), and we observed that the proportion of adolescents having optimal adherence to the MD was significantly higher after nutritional intervention with respect to baseline (T0: 24.71% vs. T1: 43.52%, p = 0.001).  In Figure 1, we reported the compliance with items from KIDMED test in the three separate PA groups.

26,discussion0," In the present study, we highlighted the impact of nutrition education intervention and PA on the adherence to the MD and on inflammatory status in healthy adolescents living in a Mediterranean area of Southern Italy.  In adolescents, Sahingoz and Sanlier (29) have reported that poor nutrition knowledge related to food sources of macro- and micronutrients was associated with low adherence to the MD. Conflicting data are reported in previous observations on the adherence to the MD in adolescent athletes following nutrition education since only in few studies the intervention resulted in improvements in food choices, and it was correlated with most successful sports performance (30–32).",6e58abb3-9039-4d08-ba63-42ac5f72216d
27,discussion1," Recently, a systematical review of the scientific literature available on MD adherence in adolescents showed the direct association between adherence to the MD and PA (and possibly with diet adequacy) and the inverse correlation with sedentary behavior, while the results for other variables such as gender, age, weight, and socioeconomic status were not consistent (33).  In our population sample, the KIDMED score showed a medium adherence to the MD with the proportion of subjects having an optimal score, which was significantly improved over the study period (T0: 24.7% vs. T1: 43.5%), underlining that they have translated nutrition knowledge into healthier eating habits. This finding is supported by the evidence that using ANOVA nutrition education program (NEP) had a positive effect on the MD adherence, while PA alone or in combination with nutrition education program (NEP) did not exert any influence.",9e790619-6012-4c02-8464-19a45fbdf831
28,discussion2," Using linear mixed-effects models, we confirmed that nutrition education intervention had a positive effect on the adherence of the MD, and interestingly, we were also able to evidence that vigorous PA intensity positively influenced healthy dietary pattern. Surprisingly, the main effects of nutrition education program (NEP) and PA lose their statistical significance when the model includes the interaction term. We hypothesize that the introduction of the interaction effect increases the model complexity, which would require a larger population sample to potentially obtain significant results. Data on the MD adherence are in agreement with those reported among adolescents and adults living within the Mediterranean area (34–37) as well as in children and adolescents outside of the Mediterranean region (38, 39).",60877b96-3202-4003-b659-2302de62cdf4
29,discussion3," Importantly, the positive implications of nutrition education sessions by a team of nutritionists and endocrinologists were observed on increased KIDMED score and a better compliance to the recommendation of the Mediterranean food choices. This seems to be very important at this age range, representing the most appropriate regime for disease prevention (40). Evidence suggests that adhering to the MD and performing regular PA, as an integral part of the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle, have been linked to health benefits (25, 41). For instance, their combined promotion may be a useful means to reduce metabolic risk and obesity in adult populations (42). Specifically, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported that high adherence to the MD and PA decreased the risk factors related to several metabolic and chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancers, and was associated with a reduced mortality (38, 39).",af90b26e-e839-462f-8f8e-e526dda62f3c
30,discussion4," Low-grade inflammation has emerged as critical in the pathogenesis of these chronic diseases being characterized by abnormal cytokine production and the activations of inflammatory signaling pathways (43). The protection provided by the MD pattern against the diseases associated with chronic low-grade inflammation can probably be due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (7, 44). Inflammatory process is associated with changes in the production of serum cytokine levels that may either increase (pro-inflammatory) or decrease (anti-inflammatory) in response to inflammation. In our study, serum levels of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were higher in adolescents at T1 compared with T0 irrespective of different levels of PA.",096ceecb-d12c-44b4-abac-562acde1c68b
31,discussion5," Moreover, we found a direct correlation between the assayed pro-inflammatory IL-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which may be responsible to control the balance of inflammation in healthy population at both times of observation. Thus, we speculate that these findings are not related to the impact of nutrition education program (NEP) or PA but are probably due to other factors contributing to maintain inflammatory balance in adolescents.  In clinical practice, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) biomarkers are widely used for identifying and monitoring individuals with inflammatory systemic activity (45–49). Evidence from previous studies suggests that erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), when elevated in adolescence, is positively associated with premature mortality, making it a suitable marker of inflammation when collecting large amounts of data (50, 51).",b84b1a66-1d01-47c4-950e-350d5ccbbd07
32,discussion6," In adolescents, C reactive protein (CRP) is inversely related to vigorous-intensity levels of PA, showing that exercise may protect against low-grade systemic inflammation in youth (48). In a recent cross-sectional design, Cayres et al. (52) demonstrated that in adolescents both previous sports participation and regular engagement in PA are inversely related to C reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating that frequency and intensity of sports are important factors associated with C reactive protein (CRP) levels. In line with these observations, we also found that C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels were correlated with several body composition parameters indicative of healthier status, C reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly reduced over the study period, while erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was influenced by either PA or nutrition education program (NEP) in our adolescents.",5e65e965-6718-4c0c-94cb-1e0ff0ecc2c0
33,discussion7," In the past couple of decades, also ferritin, first discovered as an iron storage protein, has been considered a marker of inflammation, used for predicting and even diagnosing many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and various forms of cancer (49, 53–55). Particularly, elevated serum ferritin levels have been demonstrated to be associated with worse metabolic profile and with an increased cardiometabolic risk in adolescence (49), indicating ferritin as a marker of inflammatory-related diseases. Our results showed that ferritin levels were significantly decreased in all adolescents longitudinally. This latter finding is in agreement with a recent investigation in which ferritin was positively and longitudinally associated with worse health conditions at the adolescent stage (55).",bff9253e-3565-4459-8e26-fd7cc5458805
34,discussion8," Finally, nutrition education program (NEP) was inversely correlated with both C reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin levels, suggesting the usefulness to measure these inflammatory biomarkers in the young population from a clinical health perspective.  The limitations of the study include the lack of a control group, the relatively small population studied, and the evaluation of the adherence of MD using only KIDMED test. On the other hand, our longitudinal study strengthens the importance to improve healthy dietary habits in adolescents generating useful data for further investigations in a large number of individuals.  Conclusions  In summary, this longitudinal study demonstrates the effectiveness to improve nutrition education and to foster an adequate PA intensity levels in adolescents in order to enhance MD adherence and to impact inflammatory marker levels as a strategy for assuring the prevention and control of chronic non-communicable diseases over the entire lifespan.",9a9ed3c3-5d18-4041-9736-57ccb87d5d1d
