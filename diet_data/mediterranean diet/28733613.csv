0,methods0,"2.1. Cell Culture and Treatments Mouse neuro-2a (N2a) neuroblastoma cells (ATCC® CCL-131™) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). N2a cells were plated at a density of 34 × 103 cells/cm2; they were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)) with high glucose (4.5 g/L), stable glutamine, and sodium pyruvate (Dominique Dutscher, Brumath, France) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum (FBS), Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) and containing 1% (v/v) antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin) (Pan Biotech). N2a cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and passaged twice a week. N2a cells are broadly used to study the neuronal differentiation mechanism and neurite outgrowth [45].",6cf840b0-9a27-4941-b50c-692701326846
1,methods1,"  To evaluate the cytotoxicity and the differentiating properties of resveratrol (resveratrol (RSV)), apigenin (apigenin (API)), and retinoic acid (RA), 12 × 104 N2a cells were cultured per well in 6-well plates (FALCON, Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA) or in tissue culture dishes (35 × 10 mm, FALCON) containing 1 mL of culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 24 h of cell culture, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were cultured for 48 h in the absence or presence of polyphenol (resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API)) or RA used in a range of concentrations from 6.25 to 50 µM in culture medium without or with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). resveratrol (RSV) (corresponding to trans-resveratrol), apigenin (API), and RA (corresponding to trans-retinoic acid) were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Quentin-Fallavier, France).",30b8a232-9527-474d-866c-8977fcb6aa23
2,methods2," Absolute ethanol (EtOH; Carlo Erba Reagents, Val de Reuil, France) was used as vehicle to dissolve resveratrol (RSV), whereas dimethyl sulfoxide (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); Sigma-Aldrich) was used as vehicle to dissolve apigenin (API) and RA. RA was used as positive control to induce neuronal differentiation as it is well established that all-trans RA induce N2a differentiation into neuronal cells characterized by neurite outgrowth [46].  When the cells were simultaneously treated with the inhibitors H89 (20 µM), U73122 (1 µM), chelerythrine (1 µM) (Sigma-Aldrich), and U0126 (20 µM) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), which contain positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA), PLC, protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) and MEK inhibitors, respectively, these compounds were introduced in the culture medium 30 min before resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API), or RA.",4b7f470a-cf63-4e78-9de5-371b39c92c38
3,methods3," H89 was prepared as a stock solution at 1 mM in distilled water; U0126, U73122 and chelerythrine were prepared as a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 0.1 mM, 0.1 mM, and 1 mM, respectively. To evaluate the involvement of the metabotropic receptor in N2a cell differentiation, the metabotropic receptor antagonist cyclo1–8[DLeu5] OP (10−6M) was added in the culture medium 30 min before resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API), or RA.  2.2. Evaluation of Neuronal Differentiation with Morphological Criteria Morphological criteria were used to evaluate neuronal differentiation [47,48,49] on N2a cells cultured in 6-well plates. These criteria were defined on N2a cells with the use of octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), which is known to trigger neuronal cytoprotection and is capable of inducing differentiation on N2a cells. It is therefore considered as a neuroprotectin [50].",c5cfa56f-afd7-4992-9546-053a1d33c376
4,methods4," After 24 h of culture in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), the culture medium was removed and N2a cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence of very low concentrations of octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) (10−14 and 10−12 M) without fetal bovine serum (FBS) (0% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) or with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). N2a cells (morphologically evocating neuroblasts) have the ability to differentiate in young immature and mature neurons. Under treatment with octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), differentiated N2a cells with dendrites (D), axons (A) and dendrites + axons (D + A) were observed (Supplementary Figure S1).  These morphological criteria were further used to evaluate the ability of resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) to induce neuronal differentiation comparatively to RA used as a positive control.",661a3c5b-9073-4c51-81f9-18acd79db10e
5,methods5," Morphological changes were evaluated after 48 h of culture, in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) without fetal bovine serum (FBS) (0% fetal bovine serum (FBS)), in the absence or presence of resveratrol (RSV) (12.5 µM), apigenin (API) (12.5 µM), and RA (6.25 µM), and in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the absence or presence of resveratrol (RSV) (12.5 µM), apigenin (API) (12.5 µM) and RA (25 µM). Cells were observed by phase contrast microscopy under an inverted Zeiss microscope (Primovert, Jena, Germany) at a 20× magnification (Objective: LD Plan-Achromat, ref: 415500-1614-000). Digitalized images were obtained with a Zeiss camera (5MP HD IP). Neuronal differentiation was determined on 20 images corresponding to 20 microscopical fields (5 × 4) taken at the center of the culture dish. N2a cell differentiation was quantified by neurite outgrowth (dendrites and/or axons).",9786bc8a-d8a4-473b-b812-2b2c4184dfc3

7,methods7," Measurement of Cell Viability with the Fluorescein Diacetate (fluorescein diacetate (FDA)) Test N2a cells, previously cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 6-well plates, were further incubated for 48 h without or with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the absence or presence of resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API), and RA (6.25 to 50 µM). At the end of the treatment, cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 15 µg/mL fluorescein diacetate (fluorescein diacetate (FDA), Sigma-Aldrich), rinsed twice with phosphate buffer saline (phosphate buffer saline (PBS)) and lysed with a Tris/HCl solution containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) (Sigma-Aldrich). The fluorescein diacetate (FDA) test is a cell viability test. Fluorescence was measured with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 528 nm using a plate reader (Tecan Sunrise, Tecan, Lyon, France).",ab80a9ad-4367-4465-9663-af28a8afc364
8,methods8," All assays were performed at least in four independent experiments.  2.2.3. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle Flow cytometric analyses were carried out after staining with propidium iodide (PI) to determine the impact of resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API), and RA on the repartition of the cells in the different phases of the cell cycle. To this end, N2a cells previously cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were further cultured for 48 h either in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) without fetal bovine serum (FBS), in the absence or presence of resveratrol (RSV) (12.5 µM), apigenin (API) (12.5 µM), and RA (6.25 µM), or in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the absence or presence of resveratrol (RSV) (12.5 µM), apigenin (API) (12.5 µM), and RA (25 µM). At the end of the treatment, cell cycle was realized on adherent cells collected by trypsinization.",246ff47e-bd9f-4380-81a1-8f5b96ea89df
9,methods9," Cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and 1–2 × 106 cells were stained with PI as previously described [51]. Cells were resuspended in 80% cold ethanol (2 h, −20 °C), washed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and resuspended in 300 µL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 80 µg/mL PI and 200 µg/mL RNase A. After 1 h of incubation (37 °C, 1 h), 1–2 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) were added, and flow cytometric analyses were performed on a Galaxy flow cytometer (Partec, Münster, Germany). Fluorescence of PI was collected using a 590/10 nm bandpass filter and measured on a linear scale. Subsequently, 10,000 cells were acquired, and data were analyzed with Flomax software (Partec).  2.2.4. Real-Time PCR Analysis Total RNAs from N2a cells obtained after 48 h of treatment with resveratrol (RSV) (12.5 µM), apigenin (API) (12.5 µM) and RA (6.",2b84c863-db70-4fe0-820b-67d4b46e73fa

The concentration of RNA was measured by spectrophotometry (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at an absorbance of 260 nm and calculated with UV Probe (Shimadzu software). Then, 1 µg of total RNA from each sample was converted into single-stranded cDNA using the iScript cDNA kit (BioRad, Marne la Coquette, France) according to the protocol reaction provided by the manufacturer: 5 min at 25 °C, 20 min at 46 °C, and 5 min at 95 °C.",c49c0e91-633c-4af5-a1cb-c3ab01f05f81

The incubation conditions were as follows: 90 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C annealing for 30 s) and a cycle from 60 °C to 95 °C. Specific amplification efficiencies were calculated with StepOne software. Results were expressed as means of Ct (threshold cycle value) ± standard deviation (SD).  2.2.5. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism5 software (San Diego, CA, USA). An ANOVA test followed by a Mann–Whitney test was used. A p value of 0.05 or less were considered as statistically significant.  3. Results 3.1. Evaluation and Quantification of Resveratrol- and Apigenin-Induced Neuronal Differentiation of N2a Cells N2a cells were previously cultured for 24 h in the following culture medium: Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) high glucose (4.",1ba6ef9e-e75f-412a-94e6-0aad274355a7
13,methods13,"5 g/L) with stable glutamine and sodium pyruvate containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). They were further cultured for 48 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with high glucose and stable glutamine and sodium pyruvate without fetal bovine serum (FBS) (0% fetal bovine serum (FBS)), or with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the absence or in the presence of resveratrol (RSV) (6.25–50 µM) or apigenin (API) (6.25–50 µM). Ethanol (EtOH) was used as vehicle to dissolve resveratrol (RSV) whereas dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as vehicle to dissolve apigenin (API) and RA (6.25–50 µM) used as positive control to induce neuronal differentiation. Neuronal differentiation induced by resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API), and RA was morphologically evaluated by phase contrast microscopy on 20 images taken with a Zeiss camera under an inverted Zeiss microscope (Figure 1).",f0c77697-6771-4ef4-ac2d-3f29cf2c83fe
14,methods14," In those conditions, cell differentiation was evaluated by neurite outgrowth (dendrites and/or axons) and differentiated cells with dendrites, axons, and dendrites + axons were quantified. In the different conditions of culture, the spontaneous level of total differentiated cells (cells with dendrites, axons, and dendrites + axons) was similar with 0% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Figure 2).  Without fetal bovine serum (FBS) (0% fetal bovine serum (FBS)), the highest percentage of differentiated cells was observed with RA (6.25 µM; 53 ± 9%) (Figure 2); at the highest concentrations, lower percentages of differentiated cells were detected (Figure 2): this could be due to a dose-dependent decrease of cell growth and/or viability induced by RA revealed by cell counting and staining with fluorescein diacetate (fluorescein diacetate (FDA)), respectively (Figure 3A,B).",2e93faf4-e89e-4575-a529-49aca5fe6741
15,methods15," In the presence of resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API), the neuronal differentiation was in the same range of order (28–40%) from 6.25 to 50 µM (Figure 2); at these concentrations, cell growth and cell viability was sometimes slightly but significantly increased with apigenin (API) (Figure 3A,B) whereas a significant decrease in cell growth and viability was found with resveratrol (RSV) (6.25 and 12.5 µM) (Figure 3A,B).  Interestingly, with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), the highest percentages of differentiated cells (30–38%) associated with a decrease of cell growth and viability were observed with resveratrol (RSV) in a range of concentration from 12.5 to 50 µM (Figure 2 and Figure 3A,B). Similar differentiating effects (10–30%), in a range of concentration from 12.5 to 50 µM, without or with a slight cytotoxicity, were observed with apigenin (API) and RA (Figure 2 and Figure 3A,B).",ed6d2b5f-5d16-4637-abf5-09601e7d4dac
16,methods16,"  Under treatment with resveratrol (RSV), and especially with apigenin (API) and RA, as the induction of differentiation, as well as the impact on cell growth and viability were different without fetal bovine serum (FBS) and with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (the differentiation was often reduced in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)), N2a cells were treated with resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API), and RA in the presence of 10% delipidized fetal bovine serum (FBS) to determine the incidence of the lipidic and non-lipidic fraction of the serum on differentiation. Of note, in the presence of 10% delipidized fetal bovine serum (FBS), the differentiating effects of resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API), and RA were strongly reduced, supporting that the inhibiting effects of the fetal bovine serum (FBS) on neuronal differentiation are due to non-lipidic compounds (Figure 2).",d23a07d9-cdcf-4c71-a411-a46930eb5846
17,methods17,"  Preliminary data on the repartition of the cells in the different phases of the cell cycle have been obtained (Supplementary Figure S2A,B). Without fetal bovine serum (FBS) (0% fetal bovine serum (FBS)), slight modifications of the cell cycle were observed compared to the control and vehicle-treated cells in the presence of resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API), and RA used at a concentration inducing differentiation. With 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at concentrations inducing differentiation, modifications of the cell cycle were mainly observed with resveratrol (RSV) (12.5 µM). However, at a concentration of 25–50 µM, which is used to induce cell death (especially the 50-µM concentration), resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) induce modifications of the cell cycle as previously reported. Thus, resveratrol (RSV) (25–50 µM), in agreement with other studies [51,52], induces an accumulation of the cells in the S phase.",0ceb3809-2b0d-438f-bad8-96c6a0af3474
18,methods18," apigenin (API) (25–50 µM) triggers a less pronounced accumulation of the cells in the S phase than that observed with resveratrol (RSV), whereas its ability to favor an accumulation in G2 + M has been reported [53,54]. RA induces an accumulation of the cells in G2 + M.  For further experiments without fetal bovine serum (FBS) and with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), the concentrations of resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API), and RA that were chosen are a compromise in terms of the ability to induce high differentiation without or with a low toxicity. The lowest concentrations meeting these criteria were selected: resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API), 12.5 µM without and with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); and RA, 6.25 and 25 µM, without and with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), respectively. In those conditions, resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) induce neurite outgrowth, and N2a cells with dendrites, axons, and dendrites + axons were observed (Figure 4).",bed48b24-cc05-4945-bacd-0d0be8bdb4d2
19,methods19," Depending on the compound considered the percentage of cells with dendrites or axons was more or less different without or with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Figure 4). The highest percentage of axonal cells (20–50%) which can be considered as a sign of terminal neuronal differentiation was observed with RA, whereas the percentage of axonal cells was from 22 to 30% and 16 to 34% with resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API), respectively (Figure 4; Supplementary Figure S3).  Altogether, these data show that resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) are potent inducers of neuronal differentiation, inducing neuritis and axon outgrowth (terminal neuronal differentiation). Of note, at the opposite of RA and resveratrol (RSV), these differentiating effects of apigenin (API) were associated with no or slight cytotoxic effects as shown by cell counting and the fluorescein diacetate (FDA) test.  3.2.",8f981cb9-f3e2-4f56-85bd-a8ff74073bd5
20,methods20," Characterization of Resveratrol- and Apigenin-Signaling Pathways Involved in the Neuronal Differentiation of N2a Cells At the moment, little is known about the signaling pathways involved in the neuronal differentiation induced by neurotrophins. As octadecaneuropeptide (octadecaneuropeptide (ODN)), which can be considered as a neurotrophin, has cytoprotective effects via metabotropic receptors involving both the activation of the positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA)/(PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC))/(MEK/ERK) signaling pathway [50], we determined whether positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA), PLC, protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) and MEK/ERK were involved in the neuronal differentiation induced by resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) (as well as of RA used as positive control) with different inhibitors: H89 (positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA)), U0126 (MEK),",1cd2c769-a185-4142-8346-2a79100a149a
21,methods21," U73122 (PLC) and chelerythrine (protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC)).  Without fetal bovine serum (FBS) (0% fetal bovine serum (FBS)), when resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) were associated with H89, U0126, U73122, and chelerythrine, a total inhibition of neuronal differentiation (% of total differentiated cells: cells with dendrites and/or axons) was observed (Figure 5A). This supports that these two polyphenols simultaneously stimulate the following signaling pathways PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC)/(MEK/ERK) and positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA)/MEK, or that they act via a receptor evocating the canonical metabotropic receptors which simultaneously involves the activation of positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA) and PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), leading to activation of MEK/ERK (Figure 5A).",d3f23cec-e7af-46ca-955e-7ff5525f29c3
22,methods22,"  With 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), important modifications in the signaling pathways activated by resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) were observed. With resveratrol (RSV), PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) as well as positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA) were required for the induction of neuronal differentiation (Figure 5B). With apigenin (API), the neuronal differentiation was independent of positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA), PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), and MEK/ERK (Figure 5B). With retinoic acid, PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) were only required for the induction of neuronal differentiation (Figure 5B).",a3d8e0e9-a1d8-41d2-b5bd-8e33fc083d37
23,methods23," Thus, with resveratrol (RSV), PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) were activated both with 0% and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); with apigenin (API), positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA), PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), and MEK/ERK were activated with 0% fetal bovine serum (FBS), whereas none of these pathways were needed with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); RA, positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA), and PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) were activated both with 0% and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Figure 5A,B).  3.3.",39d401b1-83d5-4e64-b5fc-e6b7a6156257
24,methods24," Evaluation of the Involvement of Octadecaneuropeptide (octadecaneuropeptide (ODN)) Receptor in the Neuronal Differentiation of N2a Cells Induced by Resveratrol and Apigenin Based on the data obtained with resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) without fetal bovine serum (FBS) (0% fetal bovine serum (FBS)), an involvement of the metabotropic receptors of octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) can be suspected. We therefore simultaneously cultured N2a cells with resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API), without and with cyclo1–8[DLeu5] OP (an antagonist octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) metabotropic receptor) [50].",31861af1-95ec-4d6e-905c-cd31fe69f1e0
25,methods25," In those conditions, the neuronal differentiation induced by resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) was not reduced (Figure 6) supporting that the direct activity of resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) does not require the metabotropic receptors of octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), or that resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) do not activate the synthesis of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), the precursor of octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) [37]. In agreement with this later hypothesis, in comparison to untreated and vehicle-treated cells, no increase of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) mRNA levels evaluated with the Ct values were observed by RT-qPCR when N2a cells were cultured with resveratrol and apigenin; similar data were found with retinoic acid (Table 1).",6a703413-076d-40cd-ac15-9197313d04ee
26,methods26,"  In addition, under treatment with resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API), no increase of nerve growth factor (nerve growth factor (NGF)) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) mRNA levels evaluated with the Ct values was observed by RT-qPCR (Table 1). Similarly, no effect of RA, on diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), nerve growth factor (NGF), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA level was found (Table 1).  4. Discussion Polyphenols are a broad family of molecules including flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans and stilbenes (such as resveratrol) [3,4]. Flavonoids include flavones (such as apigenin), flavonols, flavanones, flavanols, isoflavones, and anthocyanins. The polyphenols are found in large quantities in the Mediterranean diet which is rich in fruits and vegetables and which can be associated with a consumption of wine [55].",a227c664-4e39-4069-aab9-057dbdb995e3
27,methods27," Polyphenols are for the most part powerful antioxidants, and some of them, such as apigenin and resveratrol, also have anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory properties and decrease the production of growth factors as insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) [15,56]. With resveratrol, pro-differentiating activities have also been shown on myoblasts, resulting in the formation of myotubes [57]. Apigenin has also been shown to promote osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells through JNK and p38 MAPK pathways [58,59], to enhance myoblast differentiation by regulating Prmt7 [60], to induce granulocytic differentiation in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells [61], and to activate morphological differentiation and G2-M arrest in rat neuronal cells [62].",4b99697c-2d61-4f9b-b754-8e53d9616d7c
28,methods28," It has also been reported that apigenin from Croton betulaster Mull inhibits proliferation, induces differentiation and regulates the inflammatory profile of C6 glioma cells [63].  In response to the increase in age-related diseases, particularly neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation [5], polyphenols, because of their anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, could be used for prevention or even as a treatment. Several studies also reveal a benefit of polyphenols to cognitive functions [22]. Moreover, it is now well established that resveratrol prevents the aggregation of β-amyloid, which is neurotoxic [64]. In the more common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, neuronal loss is associated with the evolution of these diseases. Promoting neurogenesis could be a means of preventing these diseases.",ce9bfcdf-66fa-4c6a-9b1f-5f6de90a4ff6
29,methods29," In this context, neuropeptides produced by the brain via endothelial cells and astrocytes form a family of molecules called neurotrophins, with cytoprotective and differentiating activities [65]. However, to exert their cytoprotective effects, these molecules must be injected intracerebrally near the lesions [66]. As polyphenols have the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and accumulate in the brain much more efficiently when administered intravenously than orally [27,67,68], these properties reinforce their interest in preventing certain neurodegenerative diseases.  In this context, it was therefore important to clarify whether some polyphenols (resveratrol, apigenin) present in significant amount in the Mediterranean diet could promote neurogenesis, especially the differentiation of neuroblasts into mature neurons characterized by the presence of dendrites and/or axons.",04e05750-ebab-4ce7-9cbe-d50b423638ab
30,methods30," Using N2a murine neuroblastoma cells, we demonstrated that these cells cultured in the presence of resveratrol and apigenin in a concentration range from 6.25 to 50 μM differentiate into mature neurons with dendrites and/or axons and that the activation of the protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway plays an important role in this process. These results, which establish that some polyphenols (resveratrol, apigenin) are able to trigger neuronal differentiation, opening new perspectives in terms of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases where only few molecules are effective.  Interestingly, the differentiation observed with resveratrol and apigenin on N2a cells is as effective as that obtained with retinoic acid (used as positive control), which in humans can be associated with various side effects because of its ability to activate or suppress the expression of many genes [69].",06645e0b-320b-4277-93f1-038224e00726
31,methods31," In the present study, in terms of toxicity, the differentiation induced by resveratrol as well as with retinoic acid is associated with an inhibition of cell growth resulting from a decrease of cell viability, as evaluated with the fluorescein diacetate (FDA) test. On the other hand, with apigenin, neuronal differentiation has only little effect on cell growth and viability, suggesting different mechanisms of differentiation between resveratrol and apigenin. In addition, the differentiation observed in the absence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (0% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) demonstrates that exogenous factors present in the serum do not contribute to the neuronal differentiation induced by resveratrol and apigenin as well as with retinoic acid.",1fd8e58d-7099-42db-b055-ad6eedf71df8
32,methods32," Moreover, a comparison of the efficiency of resveratrol and apigenin to induce neuronal differentiation in serum-free culture medium (0% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) and in culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) clearly shows that fetal bovine serum (FBS) attenuates the differentiation induced by the polyphenols and retinoic acid, and that fetal bovine serum (FBS) also contributes to the attenuation of the cytotoxicity, mainly with retinoic acid. As the comparison of the differentiation obtained in the presence of delipidized serum (10% delipidized fetal bovine serum (FBS)) versus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) shows a lower differentiation in the presence of 10% delipidized fetal bovine serum (FBS) than in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), our results demonstrate that some serum proteins counteract neuronal differentiation. The identification of these molecules could make it possible to optimize the use of polyphenols for neurodifferentiation purposes in humans.",54fd7fc0-d2a9-4e35-9dba-0645de8dde38
33,methods33," The fractionation of the serum associated with a proteomic analysis must make it possible to answer this question. It has been reported that serum factors such as α1-, α4-, and β-globulin fractions can cause the inhibition of neuronal differentiation and neurite growth [70,71,72], whereas serum deprivation increases the phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2, AKt, and other signaling molecules in N2a cells [72]. On the basis of in vitro tests using patient serum instead of fetal bovine serum (FBS), one can also expect to distinguish between good and bad responders to treatment with polyphenols.",8403a9b3-a113-47cf-8697-b6b475b81add
34,methods34,"  In addition, as the ability of resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API), and RA to trigger neuronal differentiation occurs without and with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and is associated with modifications of the cell cycle (resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API): marked and slight accumulation of the cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, respectively; RA: accumulation of the cells in the G2 + M phase of the cell cycle), the role taken by cell cycle-associated molecules in the neuronal differentiation of N2a cells will require additional investigation.  Altogether, these data underline that in order to promote neurogenesis with polyphenols, it is necessary to identify the signaling pathways involved in this process to develop effective drugs and to optimize the efficiency of resveratrol and apigenin. Hence, we tried to specify which signaling pathways were activated with resveratrol and apigenin but also with retinoic acid used as a positive control.",7472267e-92aa-49ed-ae32-25f792c974df
35,methods35,"  Due to the ability of certain neurotrophic factors (characterized by cytoprotective and differentiating properties) such as octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) to exert their activities via metabotropic receptors (G protein-coupled receptors) [73], some molecules capable of inhibiting the metabotropic receptor-associated response under the effect of octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) were used: H89 (positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA) inhibitor), U0126 (MEK inhibitor), U73122 (PLC inhibitor), and chelerythrine (protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor) [38,50].",c6ae6ede-f931-4d4c-afe2-5d6f1aed1653
36,methods36," Without fetal bovine serum (FBS), when resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) were associated with H89, U0126, U73122, and chelerythrine, a total inhibition of neuronal differentiation was observed supporting either that these two polyphenols are able to simultaneously stimulate the PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC)/(MEK/ERK) and positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA)/(MEK/ERK) signaling pathways, or that they act via a receptor evocating the metabotropic receptors which simultaneously involves the activation of positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA) and PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), leading to the activation of MEK/ERK. However, with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), important modifications in the signaling pathways activated by resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) were observed.",2c5573f8-4e1a-4449-87b2-3f292c909402
37,methods37," With resveratrol (RSV), PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) as well as positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA) were activated, whereas with apigenin (API), the neuronal differentiation was independent of positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA), PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), and MEK/ERK. Thus, with resveratrol (RSV), the PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway was activated both with 0% and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), whereas with apigenin (API), positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA), PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), and MEK/ERK were activated with 0% fetal bovine serum (FBS). None of these pathways were required with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).",cbc21787-95d3-4d56-a70c-b263ae8f53d9
38,methods38," These data bring new evidence supporting that the biological activities of resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) (impact on cell growth, viability, and differentiation) involve different mechanisms. With RA (used as positive control), positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA) and PLC/protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) were activated both with 0% and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Altogether, these data support that the early metabolic pathways involved in neuronal differentiation depend on the inducer considered, and that the differentiating activities of polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API)) could involve plasma membrane receptors.",5a36acba-0531-44ab-a595-14de00bc0bd5
39,methods39,"  In the absence of serum, as the implication of a receptor evoking the metabotropic receptor and simultaneously activating the protein kinase A (PKA)/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) and positive control) with different inhibitors H89 (PKA) pathways was considered [73,74], we attempted to determine whether resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) were able to activate the synthesis of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), which is an octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) precursor [37]. In those conditions, the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) produced could in turn activate the metabotropic receptor in an autocrine or paracrine way. The very low values of Ct obtained for diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) in the control cells as well as in the cells cultured in the absence or presence of resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API), without fetal bovine serum (FBS) or with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), excludes this hypothesis.",e261b6ad-0b62-4819-88b3-6365d0448830
40,methods40," In addition, no effects of resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) were observed on nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA levels.  As resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) display more ability to differentiate N2a cells than RA, we suggest the following potential mechanism behind this phenomenon. The growth of dendrites and/or neurons requires much energy and mitochondrial biogenesis [75]. In addition, dietary micronutrients (including polyphenols) have been shown to favor mitochondrial/nuclear dialogue, which could favor gene expression such as in those involved in neuronal differentiation [76]. In well-differentiated neuronal cells, a topographical redistribution of mitochondria along the axone is also needed to favor the transmission of the nerve impulse [77].",f4305c88-80fd-4461-890b-064ce2c70a7f
41,methods41," As several polyphenols are recognized as molecules capable of modulating pathways involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (induction of sirtuins), mitochondrial activity (modulating complexes I to V activity, ATP production), and control of the intra-mitochondrial oxidative status (inhibition of ROS formation), the different benefits of this family of compounds (including resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API)) at the mitochondrial level might be predominant [78]. In addition, the mitochondria also play key roles in lipid metabolism, especially fatty acids, which are required for the biogenesis of lipids (fatty acids, phospholipids) present in the membrane of dendrites and neurons [79]. In contrast, RA is rather known to favor mitochondrial permeability and transition, leading to apoptosis [80].",654b1852-ecf3-4cba-a204-37469f3fc37b
42,methods42," It is therefore suggested that the different impacts of resveratrol (RSV), apigenin (API), and RA at the mitochondrial level, and also probably in other organelles (lysosome, peroxisome) playing key roles in the control of lipid metabolism and the equilibrium between life and death might contribute, at least in part, to the different neuronal differentiation capacities of these different molecules.  5. Conclusions Our data obtained on murine neuroblastoma N2a cells establish that resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) are able to induce neuronal differentiation and favor neurogenesis characterized by neurite outgrowth. Thus, when treated with resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API), the differentiated N2a cells are characterized by the presence of dendrites and axons and less frequently by the simultaneous presence of dendrites + axons.",e2fcf138-7b58-4e6c-b220-27bb36c01fdd
43,methods43," These morphological criteria demonstrate that resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) trigger a neuronal differentiation inducing the formation of mature neurons. Since polyphenols also exhibit cytoprotective, mainly anti-oxidant properties on neurodegeneration models [81,82], their cytoprotective and neuron-differentiating properties suggest that these compounds may mimic neurotrophin activities. These data support that micronutrients such as resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API), which are widely represented in the Mediterranean diet, could be of interest for the prevention and/or the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with neuronal loss (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease). These data also reinforce the interest of polyphenols for the treatment of major aged-related diseases associated with neurodegeneration (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) for which the therapeutic arsenal is reduced.
