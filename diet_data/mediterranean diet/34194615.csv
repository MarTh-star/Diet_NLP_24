11,discussion0," The present meta-analysis showed that diet was effective in gestational diabetes prevention, while exercise was not. However, a sub-analysis showed that exercise was effective only when introduced in the first trimester; physical activity started in the second trimester was not effective. In addition, mild-moderate exercise was effective in contrast to vigorous physical activity. Previous studies with a low quality of evidence showed the efficacy of combined diet and exercise [33, 34]. The meta-analyses lack a face-to-face comparison between different forms of diets. In addition, they did not report the timing and intensity of exercise. Another study showed similar results but only among obese women [35]. Dietary supplementation with myo-inositol reduced Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a study that included four trials and lacked generalization [36].",26572966-46b2-4450-ae38-cdcb43ef7008
12,discussion1,"  Special types of diets  Alternate healthy eating index-2010  The Alternate Healthy Eating Index diet (AHEI)-2010 is a measure of diet quality based on food items predictive of major chronic disease risk, particularly cardiometabolic disease including stroke and diabetes, and malignancies. It emphasizes a high intake of legumes and nuts, cereals, vegetables and fruits, omega-3 fats, and polyunsaturated fatty acids while limiting the intake of red and processed meats, sodium, sugary beverages, and alcohol [37].  The effect of the Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 in reducing Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) ranged from 19–46%, interestingly, when the diet is combined with other risk factors reduction (physical activity, smoking, and normal body weight) the risk reduction may be as high as 83% [38]. A 41% lower risk of gestational diabetes was observed among patients adherent to aHEI [39].",b8340742-c777-4088-9475-231fab2d54cd
13,discussion2," A genetic interaction increases the like hood of developing Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) among patients on aHEI diet [40]. In addition, health education and self-efficacy substantially improved the quality of aHEI [41], the included studies showed that Alternate Healthy Eating Index is superior compared to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and MedDiet [13–15].  Mediterranean diet (MedDiet)  The Mediterranean diet is a diet with high fruits and vegetables, bread, legumes, olive oil, cereals, fish, and limited animal products [42].  The Mediterranean diet is promising for the prevention of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), however, the results are contradictory. A recent meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trial showed the efficacy of MedDiet in preventing Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [43].",c61a1df6-700b-4c60-a789-6fbfca849cba
14,discussion3," A recent review examined the role of MedDiet in modulating immune response and inflammation during COVID-19 and showed that MedDiet reduced interleukin-6 and inflammatory markers [44]. A recent case–control study showed that MedDiet reduced Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence [45], interestingly, women who have rs7903146 T-allele showed a high reduction of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared to their counterparts who are not indicating a gene-diet interaction [46]. The protective effect of MedDiet ranged from 15 to 38% depending on compliance, genetic factors, and the diagnostic method used (8% when the American Diabetes Association was used and 24% If The International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups was used [38]. Although MedDiet was effective in preventing gestational diabetes mellitus, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and aAEI showed superiority [13–15].",ebc38526-f2d6-495f-af45-ce8f150b6a16
15,discussion4,"  Dietary approaches to stop hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH))  Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) originally developed for hypertension consists of high intakes of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts, moderate low-fat dairy products, and low consumption of sodium, animal protein, and sweets [47], of the three studies investigating the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on gestational diabetes showed superiority when compared to MedDiet. However, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was inferior to Alternate Healthy Eating Index [13–15].  Western and prudent diet  Zhang and colleagues found a positive association between Western and a negative association of prudent diet with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk, while Radesky et al. found no associations.

16,discussion5,"  Physical activity  In the present study, exercise was effective in the first trimester and not during the second trimester; previous studies showed lifestyle before gestation was effective in reducing diabetes. However, exercise during pregnancy was not [50]. Other studies showed early pregnancy (before the 15th week) lifestyles were effective [51] in line with our findings. The effect of physical activity on Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) prevention depends on the time and duration of physical activity. Exercise before or in early pregnancy was effective in reducing Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the majority of studies [52–55], while few studies showed no significant reduction. [56, 57]. A leisure time of physical activity of 150 h/week before pregnancy was associated with 68% risk reduction, and the benefits increased with longer duration [57].",4a321bd0-38b6-4300-b3e8-737a1549d5fc
17,discussion6,"  Davenport and colleagues found that exercise of moderate intensity is effective in the prevention of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) when adopted prenatally in line with our findings [58], the same conclusion was shown by other studies [59]. Davenport et al. study was limited by including all types of articles except case studies. A meta-analysis from China showed that diet and exercise were effective in reducing Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) when introduced earlier (before the 15th week), an effect that was not robot after that [51]. Other studies published in Spain and Australia [9, 60] and concluded the effectiveness of dietary advice and moderate exercise combination in Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) prevention in contradiction to the present result, a plausible explanation might be the different methods of exercise and the type of diet adopted.",bb15b5c2-e734-42ab-bde7-bd2c2f86974e
18,discussion7," The earlier adoption of 50–60 min of moderate physical activity and targeting at-risk women with a high body mass index was found to be more effective [61]. However, an update of the same study showed a limited ability to inform practice due to the risk of bias observed in the included studies [62]. Further studies limited by including retrospective, cross-sectional, and case–control studies support the above findings regarding exercise [63]. We found only one meta-analysis assessing the effect of early and late exercise on Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, the small number of included studies and the high heterogeneity limited the studies [64]. The study found no effect throughout pregnancy. A non-linear negative association between exercise before and during early pregnancy was observed by the previous literature.",bd7d36c4-120a-4be1-99d7-51e2c3dd167b
19,discussion8," The association was steeper at lower levels; however, the benefits plateaued at 8–10 h a week, a finding that may explain the contradiction between various studies assessing the effects of exercise on Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [24]. The compliance to exercise, duration, timing, and type of exercise might greatly influence the outcomes. To best inform Obstetric guidelines, studies putting the previous parameters into consideration are warranted.  The strength of the current meta-analysis is that it is the first to compare different types of diets and define the time, intensity, duration, and frequency of exercise.  Limitations  The study limitations were including some observational studies, the limitations to the English language, and the significant heterogeneity observed.  Conclusion  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, Alternate Healthy Eating Index diet, and Mediterranean Diet were effective in reducing gestational diabetes mellitus.",031ed178-d1ab-4243-bed0-43b32bad3f40
20,discussion9," The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet showed superiority to the Mediterranean. Furthermore, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index diet was better than the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Data regarding physical activity were conflicting. Early mild-moderate physical activity was effective, while late, moderate-vigorous exercise was not. Randomized control trials and genetic studies are needed for the individualization of dietary patterns.
