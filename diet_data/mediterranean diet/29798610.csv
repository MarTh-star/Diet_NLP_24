0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design and Participants The Healthy Diet and Lifestyle Study (Healthy Diet and Lifestyle Study (HDLS)) pilot was a two-arm randomized trial conducted between September 2016 and October 2017 at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC)) to demonstrate the feasibility of a nutritional intervention aimed at reducing visceral adiposity in East Asian middle-aged adults. This study included two clinic visits before the intervention (an eligibility visit and a baseline visit approximately one week apart (1.25 ± 1.2 weeks)), a 12 week intervention phase, a final clinic visit at Week 12, and a 6-month post-intervention telephone interview.",d0f2db7a-8cdb-4bfc-81da-70a9b2b7b731
1,methods1," Participants who responded to the study promotions, were first screened over the telephone to assess the inclusion criteria of East Asian ancestry (Japanese, Chinese, or Korean), residence in Honolulu County, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) between 25 and 40 kg/m2, ages 35 to 55 years, and no serious health issues. Exclusion criteria included; smoking tobacco products or marijuana in the past two years, taking thyroid medication, prescription medication or insulin for type 1 or type 2 diabetes, anti-estrogen medication (women), anti-androgen medication (men), substantial change of weight of more than ± 10 kg in the past six months, following a special diet (e.g., vegan), or alcohol intake >15 drinks per week for men or >10 drinks per week for women. Ethnicity was self-reported and at least two biological grandparents of pure East Asian ancestry were required.",47abe57e-6764-4a68-b916-f9274d8b5f35
2,methods2," Those screened as eligible were scheduled for an eligibility visit, which consisted of a fasting blood draw, anthropometric measurements, questionnaires (characteristics, medical history, medication list, physical activity), a whole-body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) scan, and training participants how to complete a mobile food record™ (mFR™) [28,29,30,31] to capture images with their mobile device of foods/beverages before and after each eating occasion over 4 contiguous days. Final eligibility was determined based on general good health, normal blood count and biochemistry profile, and dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived visceral fat area at L4-L5 intervertebral region ≥ 90 cm2 for men or ≥ 80 cm2 for women to target at-risk individuals for visceral obesity based on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) distribution in the MEC-APS study [11].",515d120b-4767-4fbf-8125-a56353bc731d
3,methods3," The baseline clinic visit involved randomizing participants into the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group or the active comparator Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group, education of diet and physical activity prescriptions, and reviewing information from mFRs™ collected between the eligibility and baseline visits. During the final clinic visit, measurements taken at baseline were repeated.  The enrollment goal was to recruit 70 persons to achieve a final sample of 50 persons to account for an attrition rate of ~23%, as reported in past studies [22]. Participants were recruited through advertisements in local newspapers, on radio stations, television news, social media, and email list-servs, and through distribution of brochures and flyers. A total of 820 people responded to the study promotions and of these, 760 people were excluded due to not meeting the eligibility criteria or declining to participate (Figure 1).",8c875fa3-3afd-424d-9044-32b1ef6bfc8b
4,methods4," As reimbursement for time and travel, each participant received a $50 gift card at the eligibility visit, $50 at the baseline clinic visit, and $50 at the final clinic visit, totaling $150 in gift cards to a state-wide supermarket chain. Participants were provided their whole-body dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA), body mass index (BMI), and blood biochemistry panel results after the baseline and final clinic visits. All study procedures were approved by the University of Hawaii Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.  2.2. Randomization and Masking Randomization was implemented within strata defined by sex and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) levels (above or below 150 cm2) and was blocked to ensure balance in assignment over the course of the study [32,33]. Stratified blocked randomization schedules were created by biostatisticians not involved in the intervention [33].",422f5878-b9cf-45fe-8a72-cacc5a0291b1
5,methods5," The assignments were printed and placed in opaque sealed envelopes with consecutive numbering and unique colors by strata. During the baseline clinic visit, research dietitians provided the participants with the next four consecutive envelopes in the appropriate stratum. The participant then selected and opened an envelope and shared the randomization information with the dietitian, who until then had been blinded to the group assignment. The participants (men, n = 18; women, n = 42) were randomized equally into either the intervention group or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group. Recruitment and clinic staff were blinded to group assignments until after the 6-month post-intervention telephone interview.",8bb2b3c6-390f-4044-8ca9-814571db9e7c
6,methods6," The current study was promoted as a healthy diet and lifestyle study, and study diets were identified as Diet 1 (for intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED)) or Diet A (for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) to reduce any influence of familiarity with intermittent energy restriction (IER), Mediterranean (MED) or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets.  2.3. Diet and Physical Activity Prescriptions The intervention group was prescribed an intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) diet for 12 weeks. The intermittent energy restriction (IER) component entailed a 70% energy restriction for two consecutive days with 34%, 33% and 33% of energy from protein, carbohydrate, and fat intakes, respectively.",b4beb0d3-3a8d-4762-b18f-416495d053ce
7,methods7," For the remaining five days per week, a euenergetic Mediterranean (MED) diet that met estimated energy requirements (estimated energy requirements (EER)), was prescribed with 25%, 45%, and 30% of energy from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. This regimen would achieve an overall energy restriction of 20% per week [22]. Participants self-selected which two consecutive days of the week to follow the intermittent energy restriction (IER) protocol, and were asked to keep to those same two days throughout the study.  The active comparator group was prescribed a euenergetic Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which met estimated energy requirements (EER), for 12 weeks, with 20%, 53%, and 30% of energy from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. An active comparator was used, instead of an inactive control, because all participants were at risk of poor metabolic conditions and would likely benefit from dietary support [34,35].",bcb0ddeb-0ea5-43ee-9adc-68b6684abc06
8,methods8," Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was chosen as the comparator diet, as its regimen is broadly recognized as a healthful diet [36,37]. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is rich in fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, and limits total fat, saturated fat and sodium [36,37]. All participants were advised to limit their alcohol intake, and the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group were restricted to zero alcoholic beverages on intermittent energy restriction (IER) days. Increases in moderate to vigorous physical activity have been documented using accelerometers in past dietary interventions among intervention and control groups [38]. Therefore, to reduce confounding due to physical activity, we recommended both groups walk up to one hour per day, up to five days a week. The intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group was encouraged to exercise on Mediterranean (MED) days only.",9d50e391-e370-4a06-a4b6-87bf23da6389
9,methods9," estimated energy requirements (EER) for participants were determined based on their baseline body weight using the equations as published in the Dietary Reference Intakes (Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)) for energy for men and women 19 years and older [39]. The physical activity coefficient for men and women was assigned using the typical daily living activity descriptions from the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) Calculator for Healthcare Professionals [40]. Information on hours in light, moderate and strenuous activity was estimated using the baseline physical activity questionnaire, which allowed dietitians to select an appropriate physical activity coefficient for each participant.  Both groups received an equal amount of planned dietitian guidance at baseline and during the intervention, although participants were encouraged to contact dietitians with any questions.",08b72634-e07c-45d1-b93b-b63f991781f0
10,methods10," The baseline face-to-face dietary consultation (45–60 minutes) with one of the three trial dietitians at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) included instructions on how to follow their respective diet and physical activity plan. All participants received personalized diet booklets, individualized food lists and menus, and trackers to help them follow their plans at home. The intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) materials were originally developed and tested by Harvie et al. amongst white women in the UK [22,41]. Therefore, the food lists and menus were modified to provide examples of foods and beverages more commonly available in Hawaii, e.g., papaya, mango, brown rice, pak choi, sweet potato, tofu, edamame. All education materials were designed in 100 kcal increments, e.g., 1500 kcal, 1600 kcal, 1700 kcal.",a8e532eb-ce19-4c7d-b9a3-bc946d91b2b9
11,methods11," For example, participants with an estimated energy requirements (EER) of 2030 kcal were assigned an energy allotment rounded to the closest 100 kcal, i.e., 2000 kcal. If randomized to the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group, the energy allotment would have been 2000 kcal on Mediterranean (MED) days and 600 kcal on intermittent energy restriction (IER) days. As an example, a food group prescription on Mediterranean (MED) days for the 2000 kcal plan was 8 carbohydrate servings, 8–14 protein servings, 7 fat servings, 3 dairy servings, 6 vegetable servings, and 4 fruit servings, and a maximum of three nutrient-poor treats of ≤ 150 kcal per week. On intermittent energy restriction (IER) days, the primary restrictions were energy and carbohydrate, and a 600 kcal plan was comprised of 2–12 protein servings, 2 fat servings, 3 dairy servings, 5 vegetables servings and 1 fruit serving.",f6d0bd9d-3d66-4e85-aa55-7c975cf3fac7
12,methods12," If randomized to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group, using the same example as above, the diet prescription for a 2000 kcal plan was 6–8 grain servings, 4–5 fruit servings, 2–3 dairy servings, 6 meat, poultry, or fish servings, 4–5 nuts, seeds, or legumes servings, 2–3 fats or oils servings, a maximum sodium intake of 2300 mg per day, and 5 or less sweets and added sugars servings per week. The personalized diet booklets detailed the amounts for servings of each food group and provided examples of types of foods to choose from within each food group. To support the dietary counseling, study dietitians underwent training in behavioral change strategies using the Body and Soul program [42,43,44]. In particular, the training focused on motivational interviewing techniques, ensuring the dietitians practiced reflective listening and provided positive affirmations rather than relying heavily on persuasion or advice giving [42,43,44].",0e7739f3-40ac-48bd-b784-bddabad15fbb
13,methods13," Dietitians contacted participants at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10, primarily by telephone, and met in person with participants during the final clinic visit, to assess participants’ compliance to the intervention plans and guide positive behavioral change.  2.4. Study Measurements Dietary intakes were assessed using the mFR™ completed at baseline, between Weeks 5–6, and at Week 11. The mFR™ is designed to capture images of foods/beverages before and after each eating occasion and allows for automatic uploading of images to a secure cloud-based server when in 3G/4G/Wi-Fi range [28,29,30,31]. During the eligibility visit, the mFR™ app was loaded onto each participant’s mobile device by a study dietitian. Participants were trained on how to use the mFR™ and provided with a fiducial marker (a small reference device of known dimensions and colors) to include in images [30,31].",33b14aa0-ee4a-43c0-85a2-55d26fab6262
14,methods14," All participants were asked to use the mFR™ over four contiguous days including at least one weekend day to capture a baseline mFR™ between the eligibility and baseline clinic visits. After the baseline clinic visit, participants in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group were asked to keep mFRs™ of their two intermittent energy restriction (IER) days bookended by two Mediterranean (MED) days, e.g., Mediterranean (MED)-intermittent energy restriction (IER)-intermittent energy restriction (IER)-Mediterranean (MED) at Weeks 5–6 and Week 11. Participants in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group were asked to keep to the same recording days as their baseline record for recording their Weeks 5–6 and Week 11 mFRs™. Images from the mFR™ were reviewed in person with a dietitian at the baseline and the final clinic visits, and over the phone at Week 6.",f49869f2-6546-434c-adee-b4e8aa266236
15,methods15," All participants were willing to download the app, except five could not due to owning an incompatible phone (n = 3), full phone memory (n = 1), or phone lacking features to run app (n = 1). Consequently, these five participants completed written records [45,46]. Data entry of before and after images of food and beverages followed the methods by Kerr et al [29,47]. Briefly, dietitians underwent analyst training before entering the food and beverage data into RapidCalc, a dietary data entry program developed at University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) [48,49]. Training consisted of identifying the amount and type of food in test mFR™ images. This task was completed with the assistance of a fiducial marker [50] for size estimation, and an additional foods questionnaire (completed by participants at baseline) to help identify occluded foods, e.g., type of milk in tea or coffee.",8448e4e6-d978-445a-83c5-96e44b2e96e9
16,methods16," A priori, only dietary records with at least two days of recording and at least one eating occasion captured on each day were to be included in the analysis.  Clinic measures were taken at baseline and Week 12. Anthropometric, body composition, fasting bloods, and blood pressure measures were collected using the same protocol as Lim et al [11]. Briefly, whole-body composition was determined by dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic Discovery A fan-beam densitometer, Hologic Inc. (Bedford, MA, USA) using APEX 3.3). Fat mass and lean mass were estimated for the whole body, trunk, arms, and legs, from which skeletal muscle mass was derived [51,52,53]. For visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) outcomes, we used visceral and subcutaneous fat area estimates for L4-L5 derived from dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) parameters. Trained technicians obtained measurements of height, weight, and circumferences of the waist and hip.",d4af8c64-9459-44c0-b15b-0d9601670261
17,methods17," Fasting blood samples were processed at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) and analyzed at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) Analytical Biochemistry Shared Resource Laboratory for plasma levels of total cholesterol, high-density (HDL and low-density (LDL) cholesterol, glucose, insulin, alanine transaminase (alanine transaminase (ALT)), and aspartame transaminase (aspartame transaminase (AST)). Blood pressure in the left arm was measured in a sitting position after 20 minutes of rest using a digital monitor (Omron HEM-907XL, Omron Healthcare, Inc. (Lake Forest, IL, USA)). Physical activity levels (PALs) were assessed at baseline using a physical activity questionnaire previously validated for the MEC [54]. The questionnaire was designed to reflect average physical activity per day completed in the preceding year, including moderate-to-vigorous activity [54].",632827b1-6a8a-48d4-809f-3f4e8ea7b53d
18,methods18," The baseline physical activity questionnaire was modified for the Week 12 visit, with participants being asked to recall physical activity in the preceding week.  During the telephone calls at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10, and the in person visit at Week 12, participants in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group self-reported how many intermittent energy restriction (IER) days they had successfully completed in the most recent week, i.e., 0, 1, or 2 days. All participants were also asked, “How well have you been following your diet plan? On a scale of zero to ten with zero being not at all, four being somewhat, and ten being following the plan very well, where would you place yourself?” and “How well have you been following your physical activity plan? On a scale of zero to ten with zero being not at all, four being somewhat, and ten being following the plan very well, where would you place yourself?”.",394961b4-1c22-4583-bf96-fa9d073441c2
19,methods19," Participants were also encouraged to report any minor or major adverse effects experienced during the study (e.g., adverse reactions associated with performing dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA), phlebotomy, or from following the diet).  2.5. 6-month Post-Intervention Telephone Interview At 6 months post-intervention, participants who completed the study were interviewed over the telephone. These calls were conducted by trained recruitment staff not involved in the 12-week intervention counseling. Quantitative questions included current weight, still following the intervention diet plan (yes/no) and extent (same, better, not as well), willingness to follow the prescribed diet longer than 3 months (yes/no), and interest in nutrition/food preparation classes (yes/no). Open-ended qualitative questions related to current health issues, physical activity, description of type of diet currently being followed, and suggestions on how the study could be improved were also asked.",7bbb7a5b-2a75-43de-b9f5-377a3aefe0ef
20,methods20," This paper summarizes and reports only the responses to the quantitative questions.  2.6. Statistical Analysis Continuous variables are reported as means ± SDs or standard error of the mean (SEM)s, and categorical variables are reported as counts and percentages. The analysis followed an intention-to-treat-analyses, where all individuals were analyzed in a randomization group, regardless of compliance. A linear mixed model was fit for each outcome. This model uses of all available data to estimate the treatment effects over time using maximum likelihood estimation under a missing-at-random assumption [55,56]. The model included an indicator variable for intervention group (intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) vs. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)), indicator variable for time (Week 12 vs. baseline, or Weeks 5–6 vs. baseline and Week 11 vs. baseline for diet), and interaction terms between group and time.",7b2e740c-014b-4d3f-b791-3f7d3a896bd2
21,methods21," The F test was used to assess the intervention effect, defined as the contrast of change in intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) minus change in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). Outcome variables included: dietary intakes, body measurements, biomarkers, and physical activity. The following comparisons were made across time points: Week 12 vs. baseline for body measurements, physical activity, and biomarkers, and Weeks 5–6 vs. baseline, Week 11 vs. baseline, and Weeks 5–6 vs. Week 11 for diet. No transformations of the outcomes were needed to meet model requirements as values for change over time were approximately normal and homoscedastic. To test the specific effects of the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) intervention on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and biomarkers independent of those on total adiposity, additional models were run adjusting for concurrent total fat mass.",cac355ef-8d35-43f5-9715-318e57a8c371
22,methods22," Model-predicted adjusted means at each time point for each group were computed. Diet data are represented as group mean daily intakes. For Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), the mean across four food record days were taken, while for the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group, means were computed by intermittent energy restriction (IER) and Mediterranean (MED) days and then an overall average was computed, weighting the intermittent energy restriction (IER) mean by 2 and the Mediterranean (MED) mean by 5. Per protocol analyses, changes in diet and body measurements were also conducted only among those completing the intervention (i.e., had a Week 12 assessment). For per protocol analyses, diet data were also reported separately for intermittent energy restriction (IER) and Mediterranean (MED) days.",516c4dc7-e63f-4b8e-bf21-185a6b90b4a9
23,methods23," To verify the reported change in energy intake over time, for both study groups, the expected weight change at 12 weeks was compared to measured weight change at Week 12. An energy deficit of 500 to 1000 kcal/day is estimated to result in a weight loss of 0.45 to 0.90 kg/week [57,58]. The average difference per day between energy intakes at baseline and Week 11 was estimated as the average of the change from baseline to Weeks 5–6 and the change from Weeks 5–6 to Week 11, which were calculated from a mixed model of energy on time, for both groups. The average change in weight in pounds was then calculated as the estimated change in energy per day from baseline to Week 11 converted to pounds of weight loss as [change in energy/500] · 12 weeks. A 95% confidence interval for change in weight was computed by converting the limits of a 95% confidence interval for change in energy.",553835f9-b23e-4321-9075-516049bc9129
24,methods24,"  Alcohol, vitamin and mineral intake, and the proportion of participants meeting the US estimated average requirement (estimated average requirement (EAR)) for vitamin and mineral intake at baseline, Weeks 5–6 and 11 are reported for both groups. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).  3. Results 3.1. Study Population The stratified randomized sampling was successful, with men and women being distributed evenly between groups, and participants with high (<150 cm2) and very high (≥150 cm2) visceral adipose tissue (VAT) being distributed almost equally between groups (Table 1).",64c9203d-71c0-4cc4-8d5d-087ca874bbb4
25,methods25," After 12 weeks, four participants dropped out of the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group and two out of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group; therefore, 87% (n = 26) of participants in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group and 93% (n = 28) in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group completed the study (Figure 1). One participant from the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group dropped out due to not being able to adhere to the diet and the other five participants dropped out for reasons unrelated to the study (e.g., work, medical reasons). There were no major adverse effects reported during the intervention.  3.2. Intervention Adherence The intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) participants completed 90.6% of the allocated intermittent energy restriction (IER) days.",9abe0263-0ee4-4bb7-be3e-82696a626585
26,methods26," Ninety six percent of these intermittent energy restriction (IER) days were completed as two consecutive intermittent energy restriction (IER) days and the remainder completed at least one intermittent energy restriction (IER) day per week. For the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group, the mean self-rated compliance to the diet prescription and the self-rated compliance to the physical activity prescription were 7.7 at Week 1, Week 6, and Week 12 using the scale of 0–10. For the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group, the respective self-rated compliance rates were 6.7, 6.8, and 6.4 for diet and 6.4, 7.3, and 6.9 for physical activity. Data from the physical activity questionnaires support there being no significant change in physical activity from baseline to Week 12 for within the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group (1.58 ± 0.22 to 1.43 ± 0.23 hours of moderate or vigorous activity/day, respectively, p = 0.",723f2b91-9d53-4262-816b-ed7687a81674
27,methods27,"49) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group (1.39 ± 0.22 to 1.27 ± 0.22 hours of moderate or vigorous activity/day, p = 0.58) or between groups (p = 0.91). Both groups met the physical activity recommendations at the beginning and end of the intervention.  Overall, there was a 23% decrease in mean daily energy intake for the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group from baseline (1590 kcal) to Weeks 5–6 (1227 kcal), and a 28% decrease between baseline and Week 11 (1152 kcal) (Table 2). Mean energy allotment for the intermittent energy restriction (IER) days was 692 kcal (range 540 to 960 kcal). Estimated mean energy intakes on intermittent energy restriction (IER) days were 960 kcal at Weeks 5–6 and 929 kcal at Week 11 (Table S1). For the Mediterranean (MED) days, the mean energy allotment was 2307 kcal (range 1800 to 3200 kcal). Estimated mean energy intakes on Mediterranean (MED) days were 1222 kcal at Week 5–6 and 1144 kcal at Week 11.",80550d20-bf59-4d21-8610-fddc73d24e0f
28,methods28," For the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group, energy intake decreased by 22% between baseline (1803 kcal) and Weeks 5–6 (1414 kcal) and by 16% between baseline and Week 11 (1507 kcal) as seen in Table 2. Mean energy allotment was 2300 kcal (range 1800 to 3400 kcal).  The prescriptions for percentage energy from protein, carbohydrates and total fats for the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group were approximately 28%, 42%, and 31%, respectively (weighted for two intermittent energy restriction (IER) days and five Mediterranean (MED) days). By Week 11, participants in this group increased their percentage energy from protein from 18.7% to 25.7%, almost matching the prescription of 28%. The mean percentage energy from carbohydrates decreased from 44.8% to 35.1% which was lower than the goal of 42%. Percentage energy from total fats increased from 36.6% to 40.2%, as compared to the recommended of 31%.",dc173736-2e12-4035-b1d2-04f12f8faf13
29,methods29," When examined as absolute intake, participants in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) decreased their mean intakes of total fats from 64.7 g at baseline to 51.8 g at Week 11, and their mean intakes of carbohydrates from 180 g to 103 g. Since the drop in grams of carbohydrates was proportionally larger than the drop in total fats, percentage of energy from carbohydrates decreased and percentage energy from total fats increased. For the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group the recommended percentage energy from protein, carbohydrates and total fats was 20%, 53%, and 30%, respectively. By Week 11, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group increased percentage energy from protein from 17.3% to 18.9%, with the goal of reaching 20%. At baseline, percentage energy from carbohydrates and total fats were 44.1% and 38.3%, respectively, and did not significantly change by Week 11.",8f16a96c-1e9e-4943-b959-c3ebf0c1dbfb
30,methods30," Assessing absolute intakes, mean carbohydrate intakes dropped from 198 g to 169 g and mean intakes of total fats decreased from 77.6 g to 62.7 g. Total energy intake also decreased by Week 11; therefore, the drop in grams of carbohydrates and total fats consumed did not affect percentage of energy from these macronutrients. For both the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) groups there were no significant changes in total energy (kcal); percentage energy from total protein, fat, or carbohydrate; and grams of protein, fat, or carbohydrate consumed between Weeks 5–6 and Week 11. In per protocol analyses, similar patterns were seen (Table S1).",74d4b030-c178-4b3a-a323-a425881c7146
31,methods31,"  At Week 11, and only among the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group, reductions in calcium, thiamin, and folate intakes were observed, as well as, the proportion of participants meeting the estimated average requirement (EAR) for calcium, thiamin, and folate (Tables S2–S3). A more detailed description of alcohol and micronutrient intake and proportion of participants meeting the estimated average requirement (EAR) for micronutrients can be found in the supplementary tables (Tables S2–S3).  3.3. Changes in Anthropometric, dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA), and Biomarker Measurements at Week 12 Both the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) groups experienced significant reductions in all anthropometric and dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements from baseline to Week 12 (Table 3).",e604f0d3-56c1-41db-9a71-5911f6baebf5
32,methods32," Between groups, the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group had a significantly greater loss of weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, percentage body fat, fat mass, muscle mass, total lean body mass, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) compared to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group (Table 3). These decreases in anthropometric and dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures were close to double for the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group compared to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group and over three times the amount for change in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). In the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group, approximately 73% of participants lost 5% or greater of their weight and 27% of participants lost 10% or greater of their weight.",34ae7178-6092-4efe-8605-bf81cb776344
33,methods33," In the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group, these were 32% and 7%, respectively. Per protocol analyses, showed similar results for change in anthropometric and dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements between and within groups (Table S4). After adjusting for concurrent total fat mass, change in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was no longer significantly different between groups (intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) −8.6 ± 3.1 cm2 vs. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) −3.7 ± 2.6 cm2, p = 0.188). The visceral adipose tissue (VAT)/subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) ratio did not change significantly for either group between baseline and Week 12 (Table 3). Based on the average difference per day between energy intakes at baseline and Week 11, and the guidelines of an energy deficit of 500 to 1,000 kcal/day is estimated to result in a weight loss of 0.45 to 0.",e8a8d5d8-7ccb-4275-a9cf-095da894ce38

Actual mean weight loss at Week 12 was 5.9 kg; therefore, fell within the expected range. For the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group, expected mean weight loss at Week 12 was 3.6 (0.2–6.9) kg. Actual weight loss was 3.3 kg; therefore, also fell within the expected range. All fasting blood biomarkers (total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartame transaminase (AST)), except HDL cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly improved in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group, whereas only triglycerides, insulin, and blood pressure improved in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) (Table 4).",579d2f7f-c68b-441e-858b-1eb9231abd74

For the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group there was a significant increase in body weights (p = 0.03).",035a6d44-a5cb-4095-b352-4750a67b7e0e
36,methods36," During the post-intervention telephone call, both the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) groups reported physical activity of over 3.5 hours/week (mean). In addition, 71.4% of participants in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group, compared to 88.0% in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group, reported they were able to follow the prescribed diet longer than three months after the study finished (Table 5). The mean amount of time participants could follow the diet prescription was 5.0 months for the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group vs. 3.6 months for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group.

Discussion This is the first known pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally adapted intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) vs. an active comparator (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet) to reduce dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) measured visceral adipose tissue (VAT) among East Asian Americans. This study was also unique in that the mFR was used to capture dietary intake. Despite the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) diet being different to traditional and acculturated Asian diets, participants complied well to prescriptions.",4d6a8054-6243-4bb9-8d11-db580d7a15f7
38,methods38," For both study arms, the recommendations, which appeared most difficult to achieve were those for carbohydrate and fat, with percentage of energy from carbohydrates being consistently lower than recommended and percentage of energy from total fats being consistently higher. Despite reductions in energy intake, the proportion of fiber in the diet, for the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) groups, was higher at Week 12 than baseline. Both study groups had significant reductions in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), weight, and total adiposity.",b355cb5a-b9b8-4ec5-aaa1-374937aa73a1
39,methods39," Although loss of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was greater in intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) than in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), this appeared to be due to the greater loss of total fat in intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) as there was no significant group difference after adjusting for concurrent total fat mass. For intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED), we observed general improvements in metabolic risk biomarkers, particularly in total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartame transaminase (AST), insulin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Only the reduction in alanine transaminase (ALT) was significantly greater in intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) vs. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), a difference maintained after adjusting for concurrent total fat mass.",49e48611-3ec7-4202-969c-7f9b28c5a9af
40,methods40," This indicates a potentially greater benefit of intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) on liver function, compared to a healthful dietary pattern [59]. The observed results were not due to differences in physical activity as both groups reported similar levels of physical activity at the beginning and end of the intervention, and these levels met the physical activity recommedations. This pilot study demonstrated that an intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) vs. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) intervention can be successfully conducted with East Asian Americans, and with a low attrition rate of 10%.  Consistent with our results, other intermittent energy restriction (IER) trials involving two energy restricted days as consecutive or non-consecutive restricted days (termed “5:2” [55]) have reported high study retention and protocol adherence [22,55,60,61]. Attrition rates range from 4.",642cab83-b09b-45cb-9fca-2ccc1d30ab64
41,methods41,"2% to 23% [22,55,60,61], which supports observations of participants being able and willing to complete “5:2” trials. In the “5:2” study by Harvie et al, a study arm was prescribed a 70% energy restriction for two consecutive days and 5 non-restricted days following a euenergetic Mediterranean (MED) diet [22]. Over three months, participants in the intermittent energy restriction (IER) study arms in the Harvie et al trial completed 74–76% of their two intermittent energy restriction (IER) days, indicating high study compliance [22]. Similarities between the current study and the Harvie et al. trials were energy intake was higher than prescribed on intermittent energy restriction (IER) days, and energy and carbohydrate intakes were lower than prescribed on non-restricted days [22]. This highlights that participants do well at completing their intermittent energy restriction (IER) days, but may need extra support with meeting their energy and carbohydrate prescriptions.",180b20bb-b530-4efc-98af-e9dbb972dfd4
42,methods42," Results from the current study also support previous findings that participants do not over eat on non-restricted days [18,22]. Harvie et al [22] hypothesized that the reduced intake on non-restricted days could be due to behavioral aspects of following intermittent energy restriction (IER) (e.g., intermittent energy restriction (IER) made participants more aware of habitual intakes, and increased awareness of appetite and hunger). Also, for both groups, dietitians promoted consuming high quality unprocessed diets on euenergetic days, which may have resulted in participants consuming less energy than prescribed [62]. As part of the post-intervention follow up call, the majority of participants from both groups reported nutrition classes and/or food preparation classes would have been helpful. Incorporating nutrition classes and/or food preparation classes may be a useful strategy to improve compliance to dietary prescriptions [63].",0a66b5e0-8032-40fd-a089-74fcfece8b10
43,methods43,"  We observed no preferential loss of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group compared to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group after adjusting for concurrent total fat mass. The results of this analysis could be clinically true if the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group was able to lose similar amounts of fat mass to the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group and maintain this loss. However, results suggest that intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) is easier to follow than the euenergetic Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and weight loss easier to maintain. For example, self-rated dietary compliance scores were higher for intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) (7.7 at Weeks 1, 6 and 12) compared to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) (6.7, 6.8, and 6.",bf62c1f2-bac5-451f-8439-16654be1a8ee
44,methods44,"4, respectively), and at 6-months post-intervention 66.7%, of the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group vs. 44.0% of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group reported still following their diet prescriptions. In addition, between the Week 12 visit and the 6-month post-intervention telephone interview, amongst participants completing the call, self-reported weight suggested that weight loss was maintained in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group and that weight increased in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group. These results are promising as continuous energy restriction (CER) is known to be difficult to follow long term [16]; therefore, intermittent energy restriction (IER) may be an easier alternative to adopt.",450f27ec-8700-41ba-bf4b-b0fb02041acd
45,methods45,"  visceral adipose tissue (VAT) data were not collected at 6-months post intervention; however, given the self-report of weight maintenance, it is likely that loss of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was also maintained in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group [15]. The only known “5:2” intermittent energy restriction (IER) trial to assess the effect of intermittent energy restriction (IER) on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is the HELENA trial carried out over 50 weeks [55]. This trial found that intermittent energy restriction (IER) did not exert stronger effects on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) loss than continuous energy restriction (CER) [55]; however, their trial incorporated two non-consecutive restriction days. Incorporating two consecutive vs. non-consecutive restriction days may have differing effects on health outcomes. The former may likely produce higher reductions on insulin resistance and percentage body fat [22,55].",51c07f2d-918c-44d3-8855-88fcc46bd5af
46,methods46," Therefore, further long term studies are needed to assess the effects of “5:2” trials with 2 consecutive restriction days on visceral adipose tissue (VAT). The intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) groups reduced visceral adipose tissue (VAT) proportionally to their change in total adiposity and the difference between groups may be due to the difference in energy intakes. Diets limited in sodium and more in line with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, have been associated with lower visceral adipose tissue (VAT) [27,64], which likely contributed, along with the observed decrease in energy intake, to the loss of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group. These improvements in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) may explain the lack of significant difference between groups in most metabolic risk biomarkers.",99319172-b5ce-45f7-b95a-e36becdade8e
47,methods47," The greater improvement in alanine transaminase (ALT) in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group vs. the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group is important as alanine transaminase (ALT) is a biomarker for non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [59]. Significant reductions in alanine transaminase (ALT) in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group even after adjusting for change in total adiposity suggest improvements in liver function, beyond that obtained by visceral adipose tissue (VAT) reduction alone [59]. However, liver fat measurement e.g., by abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are needed to confirm this.",1eb5ead1-9892-41d4-8bb1-e9c75d94ed44
48,methods48," The decrease in alanine transaminase (ALT) when following intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) is consistent with the European guidelines for non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which recommend following a Mediterranean (MED) diet and energy restriction to improve non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [26].  For the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group, there was a reduction in dietary calcium, thiamin, and folate intakes, and in the proportion of participants meeting the estimated average requirement (EAR) for calcium, thiamin, and folate. Past “5:2” studies have also reported reductions in micronutrients [22,61]; for example, Harvie et al expressed concern about lower intakes of calcium, iron, zinc, vitamins A and D and fiber in the intermittent energy restriction (IER) groups [22].",4bee323d-7e4e-4d9b-bf12-554b914492d1
49,methods49," Previous “5:2” trials, have prescribed a healthful diet [22,55] or recommended participants follow their usual diet [60,61] on non-restricted days. Given the large energy deficit on restricted days, prescribing a balanced diet on non-restriction days along with a nutritional supplement may help to limit any possible deficiencies. In the current study, blood measurements to assess nutritional deficiencies were not completed. Across “5:2” trials, including the current study, there were no reported serious adverse effects [22,55,61].  The strengths of the design for the current study include the stratified random design, the inclusion of an active comparator, blinding of participants and study staff (other than dietitians) to group allocations, the ethnic/racial tailoring of the intervention prescriptions, and providing the same physical activity recommendations for both study arms. Another strength was the low attrition rate, which added to the validity and reliability of study results.",6779f515-0de9-4cae-b2ee-1fbe51083408
50,methods50," The reliability is evident from the similarity in results between the intention-to-treat analyses using all participants (n = 60) and the per protocol analyses using only participants who completed the study (n = 54). Additional strengths were the use of the mFR™ for assessing dietary intake, which was used to help generate responses to study promotions, encourage adherence during the intervention, and allowed the intervention dietitians to monitor dietary intakes in real time [28,29,30,65], and the novel use of dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure visceral adipose tissue (VAT).  Limitations of the current pilot study include the small sample size, which may have limited statistical power to show small differences between groups. Also, the possible misreporting of dietary intake, with underreporting of dietary intakes being common among people with overweight or obesity [66,67].",84a24be3-34e6-48c3-8167-435722d329dc
51,methods51," However, weight loss achieved by participants in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) groups corresponded well to the average change in daily energy intake between baseline and Week 11, indicating at the group level, the dietary data was collected and analyzed accurately [57,58]. Another limitation is that results from the 6-month post-intervention telephone interview may not be representative of the study sample due to not all participants responding and the self-reported nature of the information collected. There have been limited studies comparing dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)-based visceral adipose tissue (VAT) measures with CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, in the few studies reported, the dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) results overestimated visceral adipose tissue (VAT), particularly in individuals with higher visceral adipose tissue (VAT) levels [68,69,70].  5.",1c9f6b80-7099-48e0-96aa-755ba9fa764b
52,methods52," Conclusions In summary, this randomized pilot study, testing the effects of intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) vs. an active comparator Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) levels, was successfully conducted among a relatively small sample of East Asian Americans in Hawaii. Despite the prior belief among the investigators that the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) diet would be challenging to adopt among East Asian Americans, the participants complied well to the culturally adapted study prescriptions and the attrition rate was low.",ecb113c5-013f-49d6-bee5-c09db74873d3
53,methods53," Visceral adiposity, as well as total fat mass and alanine transaminase (ALT), were reduced to a greater extent in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) diet group than in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet group, possibly because the observed decrease in energy intake was greater in the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) group. Within groups, changes in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) may have resulted from changes in macronutrient intakes. intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) was superior to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) in improving alanine transaminase (ALT) since this improvement was not explained by the greater reduction in total fat mass.",4b25349c-1718-4c85-84b9-c4330412b6cc
54,methods54," The results of this pilot study are promising, and further studies addressing a larger sample of men and women are needed to confirm the effectiveness of the intermittent energy restriction (IER)+Mediterranean (MED) diet on change in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and its possible beneficial effect on liver fat, in the short term and long term.
