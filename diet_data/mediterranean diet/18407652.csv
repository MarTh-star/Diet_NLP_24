0,background0,"Lebanon has been experiencing a nutritional transition in food choices during the past             years from the typical Mediterranean diet into the fast food pattern [1]. Dietary habits of young adults are affected by the fast-food market. As a             consequence, overweight and obesity are increasingly observed among the young. Obesity             in combination with unhealthy life style, such as smoking and physical inactivity, may             increase the risk of chronic diseases. In this regard, nutritional knowledge may act as             a deterrent against fast-food trend. Thus, universities may contribute significantly in             reducing the prevalence of obesity among the young population through the promotion of             healthy eating habits.",83ea0f55-c234-49e5-9033-95f16277c80f
1,background1, Universities may provide an ideal forum for reaching out to a             large number of young adults through nutrition education programs that may positively             influence students' eating habits by advocating for the adoption of healthy food             choices. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of overweight and             obesity in a sample of students from the Lebanese American University and examine their             eating habits. Assessing students' weight status and eating habits will help health             educators to develop proper nutrition-related education programs that promote healthy             food choices and good eating habits. ,214932df-09eb-4bd3-b959-6b15bf009442
2,methods0,"Design and sample The study design was a cross-sectional survey conducted at the Lebanese American                University (Lebanese American University (LAU)) campus during the fall 2006 semester. A sample of 220 students                (43.6% male and 56.4% female), aged 20 ± 1.9 years participated in this                study. Students were recruited randomly by a trained student accompanied by an Lebanese American University (LAU)                professor. The response rate among students was high. Students who agreed to                participate in this study were asked to sign a consent form according to Helsinki                declaration.  Data Collection Data collection took place in two steps. The first step was to fill out the                questionnaire and the second step was to perform the anthropometric measurements.                Recruited students were asked to fill out a questionnaire related to their eating,                drinking and smoking habits.",d1b14f76-e9aa-4ddb-94f7-fdf91d327a13
3,methods1," The questionnaire was adopted from a previously                published study where authors have standardized its use among university students [2]. Prior to questionnaire administration, students were informed by an Lebanese American University (LAU)                professor about the study. They were given instructions on how to fill out the                questionnaire completely and truthfully. After filling out the questionnaire,                anthropometric measurements, such as weight and height, percentage body fat and body                mass index, were done. Weight, percentage body fat and body mass index measurements                were determined using Tanita scale body fat analyzer 300A (BF 300, courtesy of Abbott                Diagnostic Company, Lebanon).",2d257937-903a-42c8-9ee2-7a75a5dfba2b
4,methods2," As fluctuations in body hydration status may affect                body composition results, conditions for Tanita scale measurements were taken in the                morning (at least three hours after waking up) when students were on an empty                bladder, not having exercise, food or drink for at least three hours before having                the measurements. Students were asked to wipe off the bottom of their feet before                stepping onto the measuring platform, since unclean foot pads may interfere with                conductivity. Height measurements were taken with a secured metal ruler. Students                were asked to take off their shoes for height measurements. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was                used to assess students' weight status. According to guidelines stated by the                National Institutes of Health, weight status was classified into four categories:                underweight (Body mass index (BMI) ≤ 18.",73ab5d2c-f588-4e79-bb01-006e9ee79782

Normal range for percentage body fat was considered as follow:                10–20% for males and 20–30% for females.  Data Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences                (version 13.0, SPSS, Inc) software. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine                differences in the anthropometric characteristics of students. Results were expressed                as means ± SD (standard deviation). Parametric variables were analyzed using                students' t-test, while chi-squared analyses were conducted for                non-parametric variables.",56e11f09-71f5-44c1-8ade-311297d2e032

Based on Body mass index (BMI) classification, the                prevalence of overweight and obesity was more common among male students compared to                females (37.5% and 12.5% vs. 13.6% and 3.2%, respectively). In contrast, 6.4% female                students were underweight as compared to 1.0% males.

11,discussion0,"The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of overweight and obesity and             examine eating habits in a sample of Lebanese University students. Body mass index was             used to assess weight status. Based on Body mass index (BMI) classification of weight status, findings of             this study indicate that the majority of students were of normal weight. Normal weight             was more prevalent among females (76.8%) as compared to males (49%), whereas, overweight             and obesity were more common among male than female students. Students in the normal             weight category had at the same time normal values of percentage body fat. Prevalence of             overweight was 37.5% in males as compared to 13.6% in females. Obesity was more common             among male students than females in the studied population.

12,discussion1," Moreover, obese students had at the             same time higher values of percentage body fat. The lower rate of obesity among female             students is expected since females are more cautious about their weight status than             males, due to society perceptions which encourage females to be slender. This assumption             was supported by the fact that only 1% of males were underweight as compared to 6.4% of             females in this studied sample. Obviously, pictures of movie stars and models in fashion             magazines and mass media have a strong impact on girls' body shape and image perception [4]. University girls see the shape and weight of fashion models as the ideal             body shape and figure to attain. Girls with such strong body weight perception can be at             risk of developing eating disorders [5]. Similar findings of prevalence of obesity among male university students             were reported in recent studies [6,7].",9588b9cd-aa27-4aa8-8995-7ac4ab4c06f7

Another study conducted among 989 medical students (527 men, 462 women) from             the University of Crete reported that approximately 40% male students and 23% female             students had Body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2 [7]. High prevalence rate of overweight and obesity was also reported in a study             conducted in Kuwait University among 842 students [8], at 32% and 8.9%, respectively. In the United Arab Emirates, a             cross-sectional survey conducted among 300 male students reported that the prevalence             rate of obesity was 35.7% in males and this figure was higher than the rate in females [9]. In terms of eating habits, university students usually do not follow healthy             eating habits.",20044b24-caa9-44ce-bab8-a33592a9ff4e
14,discussion3," The typical university student diet is high in fat and low in fruits and             vegetables [10]. Students often select fast food due to its palatability, availability and             convenience. A previous survey by the American Dietetic Association indicated that             obesity, or being severely overweight, is a fast-food related issue [11]. The Healthy people 2010 objectives include a focus on nutrition and obesity             prevention [12]. In this study, data analyses of students' eating habits revealed that the             majority of students eat meals regularly and eat breakfast daily or three to four times             per week. 52.7% of the students eat meals two times per day. However, there was a             significant gender difference in the frequency of meal intake in the studied sample                (P = 0.001). As expected, intake of colored vegetables and fruits was also             common among students.",3fbbb296-d748-4a84-98ba-ef96f88856b6
15,discussion4," Alcohol intake and smoking were not common among students. The             majority of students believe that eating meat, vegetables and other foods will provide             them with a balanced diet. 77% male students and 73% female students in this study             agreed that it is important to eat a variety of foods to have a balanced and nutritious             diet. A study conducted at Midwestern University among 105 male and 181 female students,             reported that 94.4% of the students agreed that it is important to eat a variety of             foods for good health [13]. In another study, healthful diet was classified as a diet that included more             fruits and vegetables, and less fat [14]. Daily intake of snacks was reported by the majority of students. The             unhealthy eating habit of students was noticed in the intake of fried food (majority             reported eating fried food three or four times per week).",02c67e92-f2f6-4cdc-9e15-002cb09be946
16,discussion5," Frequent snacking and eating             fried food can adversely affect students' health status, given the abundance of energy             dense and high fat ingredients they contain. Improving students' knowledge about             nutrition and healthy eating habits may promote healthy body weight management among             students and reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity. A recent study conducted             among college students reported that increased knowledge of dietary guidance,                Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005, appeared to be positively related to             more healthy eating patterns thus the better eaters had a higher level of knowledge             about nutrition[15]. Therefore, developing nutrition education programs that promote healthy             eating habits for university students should be encouraged.

17,discussion6," National data on alcohol intake and the             prevalence of smoking among university students in Lebanon are limited. A previous study             conducted among 1850 Lebanese university students reported that the prevalence of             drinking alcohol was found to have increased through the 1990s. However, the author             stated that protective factors, such as belief in God (irrespective of the students'             religion), practice of faith, and family or peer negative attitudes towards excessive             drinking, were associated with less frequent experimentation with alcohol [16]. A previous study conducted among 2443 students from 13 public and private             schools in Greater Beirut reported that the prevalence rate of cigarette smoking was             2.5% [17].",70fee024-ed3a-4d82-800f-934a7ba62d95
18,discussion7," In a recent study, namely the Lebanon Global Youth Tobacco Survey (Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS)),             conducted among 5035 students aged 13–15 years from 50 schools reported that             the prevalence rate of students who were current cigarette smokers was 8.6% and 33.9%             were current water-pipe smokers. The Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) indicated that half of students who were             current smokers expressed their desire to stop smoking [18].  Limitations The findings of this study are limited by the use of a sample of students from just one             university which may not be a representative of all university students in Lebanon.",5f5d2185-13dc-449d-8a6c-4fa1b198049a
19,discussion8,"             Furthermore, students attending the Lebanese American University are usually of high             socio-economic standards; therefore, samples from different universities may provide a             more inclusive picture of university students taking into consideration religion and             socio-economic status. However, baseline information about weight status and eating             habits among a sample of university students was certainly obtained from the present             study.  Conclusion Despite the low prevalence of overweight and obesity in the studied university students'             sample, results indicate that university students would benefit from a nutrition and             health promotion program to reduce the tendency of overweight and obesity among             students, particularly males, and to improve students' eating habits.
