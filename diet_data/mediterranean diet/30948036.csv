0,introduction0,"Aging frailty poses decline in biological function that will gradually result in deterioration of physiological performance, reduction in the ability to respond to external stressors and an associated increase in vulnerability [1]. Frailty imposes considerable impact on health care cost and predicts various adverse health outcomes among older adults such as lower quality of life, elevated risk of falls, hospitalization, mobility disability, dependency, morbidity and mortality [2–4]. Although there are common pathways indicated for frailty, mechanisms underpinning frailty are still under investigation. Recently, the inadequate intakes of energy, protein, micro- and macronutrients, which are prevalent among older people, have been suggested as major drivers to onset and progression of frailty [5].  Researchers and care providers from different disciplines are avid to investigate mechanisms and strategies to tackle this unprecedented public health challenge [2, 3, 6].",9e553838-d5f7-4836-9dbd-9feb3b5b02fb
1,introduction1," It is now widely accepted that nutrition has a key role to prevent or reverse frailty. The important role of nutrition in the pathogenesis of frailty has been addressed in observational and interventional studies [7–9]. A healthy diet can provide foods and nutrients which in interaction can improve health outcomes in older people. Hence, studying the role of healthy dietary patterns is considered as a sensible approach. Adherence to a healthy diet is a significant behavioral characteristic which has been linked with reduced prevalence of chronic diseases and musculoskeletal health measures in older people [4, 10–14]. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that a healthy diet, which is rich in fruit, whole grain and vegetable is associated with lower likelihood of frailty [4, 15]. A common approach to capture healthy diet is via pre-defined dietary patterns such as Baltic Sea diet (Baltic Sea diet (BSD)) and Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean diet (MED)) [16].",23531c47-a8bc-4d91-b69f-031b35d4188b
2,introduction2," Few studies investigated the association between Mediterranean diet (MED) and frailty [4, 15, 17]; however, there is a dearth in research to compare the association of Mediterranean diet (MED) and Baltic Sea diet (BSD) with frailty.  Mediterranean diet (MED) is characterized by being rich in plant-based food (such as fruit, vegetable, nut, cereal and legumes) and olive oil (as a main source of fat); low to moderate in fish, poultry, egg, dairy products and wine and low in red meat [17]. Mediterranean diet (MED) has been associated with decreased likelihood of various diseases like colorectal cancer [18], cardiovascular diseases [14] and diabetes [19] and might be associated with frailty [6, 17, 20, 21]. A systematic review argued that Mediterranean diet (MED) has been associated with lower risk of incident frailty as defined by Fried phenotype and frail scale [17].",61c4af95-0480-4281-b23b-ad4616724737
3,introduction3," Similarly, Mediterranean diet (MED) has been shown to be associated with decreased risk of frailty phenotype after 80 years of age [21]. More recently, an intervention study among 612 not frail or prefrail subjects from five European countries (UK, France, Netherlands, Italy and Poland) found that the higher adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) was associated with decreased risk of frailty after 12 months of follow-up through modulation of microbiome [22].  Whereas, Baltic Sea diet (BSD) has been characterized by high intake of Nordic fruits, roots, whole-grain products, rapeseed oil and fish and low consumption of processed meat products, red meat and alcohol [23]. Baltic Sea diet (BSD) was originally developed to address the characteristics of a healthy diet in Nordic countries (Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark) [24].",a6c8673a-a54c-4e35-9034-687a1dcdb585
4,introduction4," Although a trend towards better health outcomes such as faster walking speed, less decline in relative skeletal muscle index and total lean mass [10], greater handgrip strength [25] and lower abdominal obesity [24] was observed by higher Baltic Sea diet (BSD) diet scores, association between Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and frailty has not been studied. The hypothesis of this study was that older women with higher score for Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and Mediterranean diet (MED) have lower likelihood of frailty and prefrailty compared to their counterparts.

5,methods0,"Study population This study was a secondary data analysis on the data derived from the osteoporosis risk factor and prevention–fracture prevention study (OSTPRE-FPS) [26]. OSTPRE-FPS was a randomized population-based trial with a 3-year follow-up started in 2003 in Kuopio. The primary aim of the study was to determine whether vitamin D and calcium supplementation would be effective in preventing falls and fractures in postmenopausal women. The inclusion criteria of OSTPRE-FPS were age 65 years or older by the end of November 2002, willing to participate, living in Kuopio province and not participating in other bone densitometry studies. The participants of OSTPRE-FPS study were selected from population-based OSTPRE study [27]. The OSTPRE was a cohort study of n = 13,100 postmenopausal women born in 1932–1941 in the Kuopio region, Finland. The baseline postal invitation of OSTPRE-FPS study was sent to 5407 women.",d94a4a70-09d9-4d07-b8d3-cdfbfcb5db5c
6,methods1," From this population, 3432 participants met all the inclusion criteria which were randomized into intervention (n = 1718) and control (n = 1714) groups by an independent statistician. Further, a subsample of 750 women (375 from each study group) was selected to undergo the clinical measurements and requested to fill the questionnaires including the 3-day food record [26]. From the subsample, there were 610 women from whom the physical function assessments and clinical measurements were collected. By the end of baseline study, 554 women returned a complete food record which allowed to calculate Mediterranean diet (MED) and Baltic Sea diet (BSD) scores. Life satisfaction scale data (used as a surrogate of exhaustion in frailty definition) were missing for 114 of these women (missing data due to not answering the questionnaire or circling two answers).",fabcccc9-c071-42ef-930e-41dfb2f91e92
7,methods2," The final sample for this study was 440 (58% of 750) women that had all the components to compute Mediterranean diet (MED) and Baltic Sea diet (BSD) scores and frailty phenotype. Comparison showed no significant differences for the baseline characteristics between the women included in this analytical sample and those excluded [7]. There was no statistical power analysis prior to this study, and it was calculated for the original intervention.  Dietary intake Women filled a food record for three consecutive days including 2 weekdays and 1 day at weekend at baseline. They had received the instruction of filling food records in advance and returned it during research visits. Subjects also reported the type of fat consumed on bread, in cooking, and baking separately. Uncertainties in diaries were clarified by phone call to the participants by a nutritionist [28].",d1c77e9e-4955-4bbf-a285-6ea795488de4
8,methods3," Assessment of underreporting has previously been reported and none of the participants was excluded due to low energy intake [29]. Consumption of foods and the intake of energy and nutrients were calculated using Nutrica program (version 2.5, Finnish Social Insurance Institute, Turku, Finland). Frequency of consumption of alcohol portions was asked in a separate questionnaire; one portion of alcohol was considered as equal to 12 g.  Baltic Sea diet score The Baltic Sea diet (BSD) score calculation has been explained and published in these data previously [10]. The Baltic Sea diet (BSD) score was modified from the original definition by Kanerva et al. (2014) [16].",7179052b-0aa1-4bde-aadf-4256f01295a7

The mentioned food and nutrients were categorized into quartiles. The first six food and nutrients were considered as positive components of Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and received value zero for the lowest quartile and three for the highest quartile.",b529d6bd-15ce-4815-835e-27c4a35074c3
10,methods5," Negative components of Baltic Sea diet (BSD) score including (10) processed meat and sausage and (11) total fat intake (as a percentage of energy intake) received three for the lowest quartile and zero for the highest quartile. In addition, intake of alcohol ≥ 1 portion (12 g) per day received value one; otherwise, value zero was given. Mentioned scores were summed up and the final Baltic Sea diet (BSD) score ranged from 0 to 25, higher score indicating higher conformance to Baltic Sea diet (BSD) [10].  Mediterranean diet score Mediterranean diet (MED) score was ascertained based on the existing scores in literature particularly those studies that have applied Mediterranean diet (MED) score in Nordic cohorts [30–32] and it has been explained elsewhere in these data [10].",e3bdea11-7c77-48b2-924e-90dcd464d28d
11,methods6," Mediterranean diet (MED) score had eight components including (1) root vegetables, legumes and nuts, mushrooms and vegetable product (potato excluded), (2) total fruit, (3) total cereal and potato, (4) fish, (5) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) + monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)): saturated fatty acids (SFA), (6) alcohol, (7) total meat including sausage and egg, and (8) total milk and dairy products. The first five food and nutrients were considered as positive components of Mediterranean diet (MED). Intake of positive components equal or higher than median scored as one and intake of them lower than the median scored as zero. On the contrary, (7) total meat including sausage and egg, and (8) total milk and dairy product were negative components of Mediterranean diet (MED). For the negative components, value zero was assigned to women whose consumption was equal or higher than the median, and one to the others.",ff31814a-3119-4f4d-8aae-16d13c87e4ed
12,methods7," Since the moderate intake of alcohol is recommended in this dietary pattern, intake of 5–25 g alcohol per day received value one, and value zero was considered for intake of alcohol higher and lower than that range. Approximately, 63% of our subjects (n = 350) were non-consumers of legumes and the median intake of legumes was zero; we added legume to the vegetable group and not considered it as a separate group in defining Mediterranean diet (MED). Finally, the values were summed up and ranged between 0 and 8, higher score reflecting the higher conformance to the Mediterranean diet (MED) [10].  Frailty ascertainment Frailty score was modified from the Fried frailty phenotype [33], which has been previously published in these data [7]. The criteria of this phenotype were (1) weight loss ≥ 5% of body weight over three years, (2) low life satisfaction score as surrogate for exhaustion (3) walking speed ≤ 0.",62f0a5c2-18d0-4501-b668-2cfe26ba61f9

All the measurements were performed by trained nurses at Kuopio musculoskeletal research unit of clinical research center of University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland. The standard standing scale was used to measure weight (kg) in light indoor clothing twice (at baseline and after 3-year follow-up). Stadiometer was used to measure height (cm), body mass index (BMI) was calculated as kg/m2. To calculate the weight loss, we subtracted the measured crude weight (kg) at 3 years from the one measured at baseline and calculated the relative change in percentage. Women with ≥ 5% body weight loss received score of one, and otherwise zero. Unavailability of the unintentional or prior weight information for the women at baseline has limited our study to define modified frailty phenotype only at 3 years of follow-up.",1acc024b-e6dc-4888-8046-a89f5fdd4cab
14,methods9," Life satisfaction score was used as a surrogate for exhaustion in Fried criteria [7]. In brief, life satisfaction was obtained using a four-item questionnaire [34]. The items in the questionnaire included current feelings of (1) interest in life, (2) happiness in life, (3) ease of living; and (4) loneliness. The scaled questions had four levels with two most opposite moods written at the separate ends of the scale and two additional options in the middle, which presented more intermediate levels of self-rated life satisfaction. Subjects showed their opinion by selecting one of the four options across the scale for each question. Total score ranged 4–20, higher score reflecting lower life satisfaction. Based on total life satisfaction score, subjects were categorized into three following groups: satisfied group (life satisfaction score: 4–6), intermediate group (life satisfaction score: 17–11) and dissatisfied group (life satisfaction score: 12–20).",58de8dfb-7a30-40b1-9d6f-ffba07b2d450
15,methods10," Dissatisfied group was considered as a surrogate for exhaustion in frailty ascertainment, and received score one, otherwise zero. To measure walking speed, women walked 10 m with their usual speed in a controlled situation. Time was recorded and walking speed was calculated as distance (m)/time (s). Walking speed was further divided for height and categorized into quartiles. Women in the lowest quartile ≤ 0.51 m/s of walking speed received score one, and otherwise zero. Handgrip strength (kg) was measured by pneumatic hand-held dynamometer (Sammons Preston, Bolingbrook, IL). Subjects were asked to sit on a chair and bend forearm of their non-dominant hand from elbow at 90-degree angle. The measurement was repeated 3 times with 30-s resting time in between and the strongest result was included. Further, grip strength was adjusted by dividing the grip strength value for body mass index (BMI) and women in the lowest quartile of handgrip strength received score one, and otherwise zero.",e6f085e9-ea91-468d-b483-09aca248f083
16,methods11," Physical activity data were collected via a self-administered questionnaire where participants were asked to report the type, hours, and seasonality (winter and summer) of their physical activity. Types of physical activity included walking, cycling, skiing, swimming, aerobic exercise, sport balls, skating, floor ball, gymnastics and rowing. However, our data analyses showed that the main physical activities reported were skiing, walking, cycling, swimming and aerobic exercise, which explained over 90% of the weekly physical activity (data not shown), and accordingly they were used to compute the final physical activity variable in this study [7]. Weekly amount of physical activity during winter and summer was calculated and the average of them was used as an estimate of long-term physical activity. To indicate the low physical activity level, the computed physical activity was categorized into quartiles.",de42ff4a-4683-4c3d-a80c-be6c10295f04
17,methods12," Women in the lowest quartile had less than 2 h of physical activity per week which is less than World Health Organization recommendation for older people aged ≥ 65 years [35] and received score one and otherwise zero. To calculate the final frailty score, mentioned scores were summed up and each subject received a frailty score from 0 to 5. According to Fried criteria, we categorized women as frail with scores of 3–5, prefrail with scores 1–2 and those with score zero were considered as referent (non-frail).  Selection of confounders We selected the potential confounders a priori based on their reported association with frailty in the literature.",e20f1d4f-54a2-4eda-af54-3487808ce71a

The association between mentioned confounders and Baltic Sea diet (BSD), Mediterranean diet (MED) and frailty was tested by multinomial logistic regression analysis. Since weight loss and low physical activity are criteria of frailty phenotype, and alcohol intake is component of Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and Mediterranean diet (MED), we did not consider weight, physical activity and alcohol intake as confounders to avoid over-adjustment.",2122f263-6688-4d1d-9ff3-eb97cde65229
19,methods14," Age (years), living status, marital status and energy intake (kJ/day) were associated with frailty. We did not find any association between smoking status (current smokers, former smokers and never smokers) and frailty. However, we considered it as a confounder since it has been usually used as a covariate in literature [2, 3, 15]. Final statistical model to test associations was adjusted for age (years), living status, marital status, energy intake (kJ/day), smoking status and intervention group.  Statistical analyses Considering that around half of the study population were enrolled into calcium and vitamin D supplementation for about three years, the interaction terms between Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and Mediterranean diet (MED) with vitamin D and calcium intervention were tested. There was no significant interaction by intervention or effect of intervention on the frailty.

Main baseline characteristics of participants were compared across the frailty phenotype status (frail, prefrail and referent) using one-way ANOVA or alternatively nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables.  In the main analysis, Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and Mediterranean diet (MED) were used as continuous variables, per standard deviation (SD)-unit increase and in tertiles.

30,discussion0,"Findings of the current study showed that higher Mediterranean diet (MED) score was associated with lower likelihood of prefrailty and frailty in older women; whereas, we observed a tendency between higher Baltic Sea diet (BSD) score and lower likelihood for frailty. These associations were independent of potential confounders. Regarding the Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and Mediterranean diet (MED) food components, an inverse association was detected between vegetable intake and frailty likelihood after controlling for confounders.  Our results regarding inverse association of Mediterranean diet (MED) with frailty are consistent with the previous studies [4, 6, 17, 20, 21]. A recent systematic review has concluded that the higher conformance to Mediterranean diet (MED) is significantly associated with lower risk of incidence of frailty in community-dwelling older adults aged ≥ 60 years [17].

Similarly, lower likelihood of frailty defined by frailty index was observed among participants who followed Mediterranean diet (MED) more closely than in those with less conformance in a prospective study with 8 years’ follow-up among 4421 North American subjects (mean age 61 years) [37]. In the French study, higher conformance to Mediterranean diet (MED) was associated with 62% lower risk of frailty in 560 older subjects, where frailty was ascertained according to Fried criteria [21].",4ffe2d61-7efc-4658-bf5b-e76efb04a76d
32,discussion2," Collected evidence from our study corroborate with existing research, suggest that Mediterranean diet (MED) is one healthy behavior which has been linked frequently with lower frailty likelihood, and it can be implemented for prevention efforts as well as in clinical practice.  Our study was the first to explore the association between Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and frailty, where tendency was observed between Baltic Sea diet (BSD) score per unit-SD increase and lower likelihood for frailty. The significant trend was observed between tertiles of Baltic Sea diet (BSD) score and frailty and prefrailty. However, the significance was attenuated after controlling for confounders. Previous studies have indicated beneficial effect of Baltic Sea diet (BSD) with various health outcomes [10], but there is paucity of data on association with frailty.",efbfa8aa-4b38-4ffe-8128-1372a1fb3f14
33,discussion3," Previously, in these data, higher conformance to Baltic Sea diet (BSD) was shown to be associated with faster walking speed (m/s), less decline in relative skeletal muscle index (kg/m2) and total lean mass (kg) [10]. In addition, in Helsinki birth cohort study, higher conformance to Baltic Sea diet (BSD) was significantly associated with greater hand grip strength in 1072 participants [25]. These results may somewhat explain the association between Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and frailty via beneficial effect on physical function as an important component of frailty phenotype.  Further, our findings suggest that higher intake of vegetables (root vegetable, legume and nuts, mushrooms and vegetable products) was associated with lower likelihood of frailty, which was comparable to existing literature [8, 38, 39]. A systematic review study concluded that higher intake of fruit and vegetable might be associated with lower risk of frailty [38].",784884a3-2a26-48ad-987f-d0ca211ee206
34,discussion4," In another study with 22 years of follow-up, higher intake of fruit (P = 0.03) and vegetable (P = 0.009) was associated with lower risk of frailty, assessed by frail scale, in 30,267 women aged > 60 years [8]. An inverse dose–response relation was also found between intake of fruit (P = 0.04) and vegetable (P < 0.01) and both combined (P < 0.01) with frailty phenotype by Esquinas and coworkers (2016), who used random-effect meta-analysis to pool the result of three independent community-dwelling cohort studies with 1872, 581 and 473 subjects [39]. In general, Mediterranean diet (MED) and Baltic Sea diet (BSD) are characterized with a high intake of fruit, vegetables, legumes, and low to moderate intake of alcohol and focus on consumption of high-quality fat [16, 17, 40]. In this study, intake of fruit and berries tended to be lower in frail and prefrail subjects; however, the association was not statistically significant.",bda4ea97-fe34-48d4-a614-a931db3d8a8f
35,discussion5," Different dietary assessment methods in the studies might explain the existing discrepancy between our result and previous evidence about the association between fruit consumption and frailty. The health benefits of fruits and vegetables are numerous and significantly associated with reduced risk of obesity [41], cardiovascular diseases [42], and bone mineral density [43]. Oxidative stress is considered as an important underlying factor of frailty among elderly [44], which may be modified by antioxidants in fruit and vegetables (vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoid and selenium) [38, 39, 45], high content of polyphenols in fruits and vegetables can provide an anti-inflammatory properties to reduce the chronic inflammation and, therefore, reduce the cell apoptosis [39], which has been associated with a greater loss of muscle mass and strength, pronounced mobility loss, declined physical capacity, and depression in older individuals [46].",50a558eb-0a25-4b3e-b2cb-6f2c4fe8f9e3
36,discussion6," Recently, the metabolic role of vitamin E has been pronounced both as a strong free-radical scavenger and in pathways that are related to a higher energy metabolic phenotype and subsequently frailty [47]. Notwithstanding, the positive influence of Mediterranean diet (MED) and Baltic Sea diet (BSD) on lower likelihood of frailty is not only attributed to high intake of fruit and vegetables, other nutrients profiles of Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and Mediterranean diet (MED), like unsaturated fatty acids, but also can contribute to anti-inflammatory properties [48]. Moreover, higher conformance to the Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and Mediterranean diet (MED) has an important role in prevention of various chronic diseases such as impaired cognitive function [49], Alzheimer and dementia [13, 50], abdominal obesity [24, 51], depression [52] and diabetes [11, 19] which indirectly can slow the frailty progress [53–57].",939fb130-e9f4-476e-8c4a-3209a868f95e
37,discussion7," Given the current knowledge, older people with higher conformance to Mediterranean diet (MED) and Baltic Sea diet (BSD) are less likely to become chronically ill and consequently frail when compared to their counterparts [4, 17]. Although the mechanisms of gut microbial contribution to frailty are yet to be determined, adherence to healthy dietary patterns can improve gut microbiome and this microbiome response has the potential to attenuate the risk of frailty [22].  We also found a strong and significant association between higher body mass index (BMI) and increased likelihood of frailty (Table 4). Further analysis revealed that the subjects with body mass index (BMI) > 29 kg/m2 had significantly higher likelihood of frailty and prefrailty compared to those who had body mass index (BMI) between 24 and 29 kg/m2 (Table 4).",3e9a38f0-3668-47db-91df-718349d41064
38,discussion8," This finding is in line with the previously published systematic review and meta-analysis among 16 studies which claimed that the obesity was associated with 43% higher risk of frailty [58].  The prevalence of frailty and prefrailty in this study (frail 8.1% and prefrail 46.8%) was comparable to previous studies, which report the prevalence rate of frailty between 7 and 30%, and prefrailty between 35 and 50% among community-dwelling older adults [2, 37, 59]. In a nutrition and health survey on 923 Taiwanese individuals aged 65 years or older, the prevalence of frailty and prefrailty was 7.8 and 50.8%, respectively [2]. Similarly, Veronese et al. found 8.2% frail among 4421 older adults (mean age of 61 years) in North America [37]. A Spanish cross-sectional study reported the proportion of 29.4% for frailty and 35.7% for prefrailty [59].",c73523e4-f8c9-432d-8f83-cbea92c0f9c7
39,discussion9," Use of various methods for identifying frailty and different characteristics of study participants such as age and gender can be the source of heterogeneity in the proportion of frailty and prefrailty. Although the prevalence rate of frailty in our study population is located on the lower end of mentioned range, we have considerable amount of prefrail women in our study population. Considering the fact that the frailty is a dynamic process with common transition from prefrailty to frailty [60, 61], frailty and prefrailty were merged as a single group to enhance the statistical power in some of the regression analyses.  There are limitations to this study which should be considered in interpretation of our findings. This was a cross-sectional study; therefore, reverse causality as frail or prefrail women altering their baseline dietary intake during the follow-up period cannot be excluded.",f44563cd-36b0-41ea-bc62-da5c92e6a160
40,discussion10," Further, using life satisfaction scale as a surrogate of exhaustion might misclassify the participants in categories of frailty phenotype. Our study population included relatively healthy older women from a homogenous Finnish population; so, caution should be taken in generalization of the results to the other older populations. Other possible limitation was that computing dietary scores based on 3-day food record may not capture the consumption of infrequently consumed food [62]. Further studies could benefit to complement the self-reported dietary data with data on biomarkers of food and nutrient consumption or related risk factors. Half of our final analytical study population (n = 220) underwent the calcium and vitamin D supplementation intervention that possibly could indirectly affect awareness of participants in the intervention group over their dietary habits.",e4161a86-37ef-482f-b2f3-b0d30423597e
41,discussion11," However, the 3-day food record was only collected at the baseline; therefore, we cannot conclude neither if the changes in dietary patterns affect frailty nor the possible influence of supplementation intervention on dietary habits. In contrast to the original concept of Baltic Sea diet (BSD) based on food frequency questionnaire measuring consumption frequencies of specified food groups, our fruit and meat categories based on food records included larger selection of individual food items. Further, our study did not consider legumes as a separate food group in defining Mediterranean diet (MED) score. The modified scoring of food groups for Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and Mediterranean diet (MED) might have led to misclassification bias.  In conclusion, our results indicate that higher conformance to Mediterranean diet (MED) is associated with lower likelihood of prefrailty in older adults.",5107db98-8871-4f47-a4ca-6b845967ecf6
42,discussion12," In addition, our study showed that Baltic Sea diet (BSD) may be presented as a healthy behavior to reduce likelihood of frailty. Amid Baltic Sea diet (BSD) and Mediterranean diet (MED) components, only vegetables were inversely associated with frailty which suggests them to be a significant part of diet for inverse association with frailty. It is warranted that further studies need to focus to identify distinct frailty trajectories (clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time) in an elderly population and to estimate associations between frailty and frailty component trajectories and diet.
