1,abstract1," However, recently randomized controlled trials with GLP‐1 agonists, farnesoid X nuclear receptor (FXR) and PPAR ligands as well as other agents have been published and may expand the therapeutic armamentarium for Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) in the near future. Finally, knowledge about treating complications of end‐stage liver disease due to NAFLD activity score (NAS)H becomes an increasingly important cornerstone in the treatment of the broad disease spectrum of Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D). In this review, we summarize currently available and future treatment options for patients with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) that may help internal medicine specialists treat the complete clinical spectrum of this highly prevalent liver disease.  cirrhosis fibrosis non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis source-schema-version-number2.",515b673f-eeb4-477d-8210-ab157f51be38

3,abstract3," The term Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) itself summarizes a broad disease spectrum: non‐alcoholic fatty liver (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)), which is characterized by simple steatosis but absent inflammation or hepatocyte ballooning, represents the mildest manifestation. Non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD activity score (NAS)H), however, is characterized by not only steatosis of the liver but also inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, and is a more severe presentation of the disease spectrum which may lead to advanced fibrosis or even cirrhosis. In approximately 5% [3, 4] of patients [5, 6] with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) complications of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma may occur during long‐term follow‐up. Of note, however, most patients with non‐advanced Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) (i.e.",dae778af-5d6c-4e0f-966e-99c49bbd9a3b
4,abstract4," Fibrosis Stage 0–2) primarily show extrahepatic events during follow‐up and the predominant cause of death in these patients derives from cardiovascular disease rather than from liver‐related events [7, 8]. Apart from the importance of distinguishing between a diagnosis of non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or NAFLD activity score (NAS)H and grading of disease activity, presence and stage of fibrosis need to be determined in every patient since it has been shown that prognosis is mostly influenced by the grade of fibrosis rather than presence/absence of NAFLD activity score (NAS)H [9, 10].  Suspicion of Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) should be raised in patients presenting with either elevated liver enzymes (i.e. liver transaminases and/or gamma‐glutamyltransferase) or those who show hepatic steatosis on abdominal ultrasound [5].",ae3d846b-c969-48ce-9d67-8afccd65ad4d
5,abstract5," Most importantly before diagnosing Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) the most common other etiologies of chronic liver disease (i.e. hepatitis, autoimmune, hereditary or cholestatic) and especially relevant alcohol consumption (≥30 g/day in men, ≥20 g/day in women) should be excluded [5]. Typically, patients presenting with one‐ or more components of the metabolic syndrome are at high risk for developing Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) and hepatic steatosis on imaging and/or elevated liver enzymes should raise the suspicion for Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) [5, 6].  A wide spectrum of non‐invasive diagnostic methods have been developed and clinically tested over the last years, the most important‐ and tested ones being vibration‐controlled transient elastography (vibration‐controlled transient elastography (VCTE)) and non‐invasive fibrosis tests (i.e.",981e2d98-3d65-49fa-9533-ab5d95176031

However, non‐invasive diagnostic algorithms and risk stratification for Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) are out of the scope of this article but have been reviewed elsewhere [4, 11, 12].  Still, the gold standard for diagnosing, grading and staging Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) is liver biopsy, either percutaneous (i.e. mostly in patients without advanced chronic liver disease) or via the transjugular route (i.e. in patients with advanced chronic liver disease, severe thrombocytopenia or severe coagulopathy). Both procedures are safe with very low risk of complications [13, 14, 15].",1a1b1efa-5ea3-48c6-8b0a-5e234533f31d
7,abstract7," A diagnosis of NAFLD activity score (NAS)H is currently not possible without liver histology, however, liver biopsy is usually only performed in patients with a high pre‐test probability for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, as indicated by non‐invasive fibrosis tests (i.e. vibration‐controlled transient elastography (VCTE), non‐invasive fibrosis scores) [5, 6]. Therefore in daily clinical practice, outside clinical trials, only rather indeterminate/unclear cases regarding fibrosis stage or etiology require liver biopsy while when cirrhosis/Advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) is evident clinicians should directly proceed to HCC screening and management of portal hypertension [16]. However, even in cirrhotic/Advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) patients, other causes of liver disease should be carefully ruled out before the definitive diagnosis of Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D)‐associated Advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) can be made [16].",befd1865-d883-49b7-8d60-9824c0b42da9
8,abstract8,"  Nevertheless, once biopsy specimens are obtained, pathologists should report the grades of hepatic steatosis [reported as a percentage of lipid‐containing hepatocytes mild (Grade 1: 5–33%), moderate (Grade 2: 34–66%), severe steatosis (Grade 3: >66%)], [17] hepatocyte ballooning [absent (0), rare (1), or prominent(2)] and necro‐inflammatory activity [absent (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3)]. Finally, the Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) activity score (NAFLD activity score (NAS)) [18, 19] should be reported as the sum of the three characteristics (steatosis, ballooning, inflammation) and ranges between 0 and 8 points; however, Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) per se is defined by the presence of steatosis so usually, a minimum of 1 point (for steatosis) should be reported to establish a Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) diagnosis.",a9690e1b-8c79-477a-8195-1bc551931d37
9,abstract9," Most importantly, however, it needs to be emphasized that a diagnosis of NAFLD activity score (NAS)H should not be made based on NAFLD activity score (NAS) alone and rather based on evaluation of patterns as well as individual lesions (overall “gestalt”) on liver biopsies [5, 18, 19] Typical histological features of Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D)/NAFLD activity score (NAS)H can be seen in Fig. 1.

10,abstract10," Behrang Mozayani, FRCPath, Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna.  Another similar, but still essentially different, histologic scoring system for Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) is the Score (SAF) score which was developed by Bedossa and colleagues in 2012 [20]. It includes three variables Steatosis (S; 0 to 3 points available—0 points rule out Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D)), Activity (A; Ballooning: 0 to 2 points available and Lobular Inflammation: 0 to 2 points available) and Fibrosis (F). To diagnose NAFLD activity score (NAS)H steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation are all mandatory [20], which is by some seen as the more accurate way to diagnose NAFLD activity score (NAS)H compared to proposed NAFLD activity score (NAS) cut‐offs, which were per se not designed to diagnose NAFLD activity score (NAS)H but rather grade/Stage disease severity.",8315f6bc-268c-471f-8614-25244066fbd4

16,abstract16,"  Treatment Of Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D)—Lifestyle factors, metabolic comorbidities and Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D)‐specific therapies  According to current guidelines [5] pharmacotherapy in NAFLD activity score (NAS)H patients should be reserved for those with significant fibrosis (≥F2) and those with less severe disease but at high risk of disease progression (i.e. metabolic syndrome, diabetes).  Nevertheless, it needs to be emphasized that once a diagnosis of Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) is established patients have increased overall mortality compared to non‐Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) patients [6, 21, 22].",0cefb374-611e-41e6-b25c-419ab2de42e1
17,abstract17," However, this increased mortality mostly comes from cardiovascular‐ rather than from liver‐related outcomes; [4, 6] furthermore, cancer‐related mortality is among the leading causes of mortality in Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) patients, mainly driven by extrahepatic malignancies followed by hepatocellular carcinoma [23, 24]. Most importantly, once a diagnosis of NAFLD activity score (NAS)H and/or advanced fibrosis (i.e. fibrosis stage 3 or cirrhosis) and/or portal hypertension is confirmed patients are at an increased risk for liver‐related complications (i.e. hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma) and liver‐related mortality [9, 10, 25].",a7aa4878-0bb0-417c-ae52-95d2a48c2ef2
18,abstract18," Therefore, lifestyle modifications and treatment of underlying metabolic conditions should be performed in all Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) patients, while specific pharmacological treatment should mainly be aimed at patients with biopsy‐proven NAFLD activity score (NAS)H and fibrosis [6]. A short summary of a possible treatment algorithm for patients with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) has been summarized in Fig. 2.  Fig. 2 Current treatment options for Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D).  Lifestyle factors  Diet, weight loss and physical activity are the cornerstone of every treatment for Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) and are recommended by both the American and European associations for the study of the liver [5, 6].",9eb678cf-164c-4527-9e93-d16c930c5d78
19,abstract19," Reducing calorie intake by at least 500–1000 kcal has been shown to reduce hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance [26, 27]. Energy restriction and exclusion of Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D)‐promoting components (i.e. processed food, products high in added fructose) are recommended by the EASL‐Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) guidelines [5] and generally speaking a “Mediterranean diet” should be recommended to all Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) patients [5].  Dieting ultimately leads to weight loss and weight loss per se has been a major link to achieving improvements in liver histology and even resolution of NAFLD activity score (NAS)H or fibrosis. In a 12‐month lifestyle intervention program in patients with type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis and incident Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) was significantly reduced [28].",ec6eb1ee-91e5-4bbb-b3b4-1fe93e81e1cb
20,abstract20," Most importantly, a study including 261 Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) patients with paired liver biopsies before and after lifestyle changes aiming at inducing weight loss found that a greater extent of weight loss is associated with improvement in histologic features of NAFLD activity score (NAS)H with the highest rates of NAFLD activity score (NAS) reduction (100%), NAFLD activity score (NAS)H resolution (90%) and fibrosis regression (45%) occurring in those patients with at least ≥10% of weight lost [29]. Nevertheless, it needs to be noted that only 30% of all subjects have lost at least ≥5% of their weight at week 52 (end of the study)—and this very much represents the real‐life issue of a few patients achieving weight‐loss targets.",10df991e-419c-4507-bd9f-08aa9d42215d
21,abstract21," Finally, a large systemic review and meta‐analysis have shown that weight loss (≥7%) generally is safe and improves liver histology and cardiometabolic profile in Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) patients [30].  Regarding physical activity, current guidelines recommend 150–200 min/week of moderate‐intensity aerobic physical activities in three to five sessions [5]. Importantly, it needs to be emphasized that also in patients with advanced chronic liver disease (i.e. cirrhosis) mild‐to‐moderate exercise is safe, reduces the degree of portal hypertension and was not associated with an increased risk for variceal bleeding or other hepatic decompensation [31].",637907a0-92fa-4f77-ad67-87df49b9fed0
22,abstract22," Most recently, a study investigating an intervention consisting of a hypocaloric diet and 60 min/week supervised physical activity in compensated cirrhosis with portal hypertension and a BMI >26 showed a significant decrease in the degree of portal hypertension after 16 weeks of intervention [32], with a weight‐loss of >10% being associated with an even greater decrease in portal pressure. Of note, no episode of clinical decompensation occurred during the intervention [32].  To summarize the cornerstone of every treatment in all patients with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) should contain the following three components: Mediterranean diet aiming to reduce the average daily calorie intake by at least 500–1000 kcal.  Weight loss induced by diet and physical activity aiming at losing at least 3–5% of body weight.",2f26294f-05bb-412c-81c4-afdcc9968cbf

Pharmacological treatment options  Guideline‐recommended pharmacological treatment options for Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) patients are scarce and currently, only Vitamin E and the proliferator‐activated receptor gamma (PPAR‐y) ligand Pioglitazone are recommended for selected patients by the European‐ and American Association for the Study of the Liver [5, 6].  Vitamin E  The anti‐oxidative effect of Vitamin E is thought to contribute to its promising results in randomized trials showing a significant improvement in NAFLD activity score (NAS)H. In 2010, the so far largest randomized trial on Vitamin E was published (PIVENS‐Trial [33]).",a52865a1-8a0f-4f1e-a33c-b26d5c69232f
24,abstract24," It included 247 adults with biopsy‐proven NAFLD activity score (NAS)H but without diabetes and compared Vitamin E (800 IU once daily) versus Pioglitazone (30 mg once daily) versus Placebo with the primary study endpoint defined as an improvement in histologic findings (improvement by 1 or more points in a hepatocellular ballooning score; no increase in fibrosis score; and either decrease of NAFLD activity score (NAS) to ≤3 points or of at least ≤2 points, with at least a 1‐point decrease in either lobular inflammation or steatosis) [33]. Vitamin E treatment resulted in a significantly higher rate of NAFLD activity score (NAS)H improvement (43% vs. 19%, p = 0.001) as compared with placebo. However, the grade of fibrosis did not improve [33]. Most importantly, adverse events in the Vitamin E group were not significantly different compared to Pioglitazone or placebo [33].",3fd884f2-bfda-4c50-982c-3b42aaebc398
25,abstract25," A study evaluating the effect of Vitamin E on clinical outcomes in 236 NAFLD activity score (NAS)H patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis found that indeed 800 IE/day decreased the risk of death or transplantation and hepatic decompensation —both in diabetic and in non‐diabetic patients [34]—and therefore adds important data into the daily clinical use of Vitamin E. Nonetheless, the latter study was no randomized controlled trial and therefore results should be interpreted cautiously. While the PIVENS trials only included non‐diabetic NAFLD activity score (NAS)H patients, it has been shown that Vitamin E treatment alone (800 IE/day) was ineffective in reaching the primary endpoint (two‐point reduction in NAFLD activity score (NAS) from two different parameters, without worsening of fibrosis) in a randomized trial including 105 patients with type 2 diabetes and biopsy‐proven NAFLD activity score (NAS)H [35]. Again no improvement in fibrosis was seen [35].",a6f1a778-fbde-4a9d-b76a-5beec75a3711
26,abstract26," Possible side effects of Vitamin E include an increased bleeding risk, prostate cancer, heart failure and hemorrhagic stroke and those should be discussed with the patient, even though they are rarely seen [4, 6].  As of 2022 the current (2016) EASL guidelines cautiously recommend (“could be used”) Vitamin E treatment for selected patients with NAFLD activity score (NAS)H and at least significant fibrosis (≥F2) [5] while the current practice guidance endorsed by the AASLD states that Vitamin E (800 IU/day) “may be considered” for treating non‐diabetic patients with NAFLD activity score (NAS)H [6]. Most importantly, Vitamin E is currently not recommended to treat NAFLD activity score (NAS)H in diabetic patients, Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) without liver biopsy, NAFLD activity score (NAS)H cirrhosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis [6].",9de04800-26fc-49e2-b78e-5821838d920e
27,abstract27,"  Pioglitazone  Even though the PPAR‐y ligand Pioglitazone (30 mg/day) did not reach the pre‐defined primary study endpoint in the PIVENS trial, which was set at a significance level of p = 0.025 due to two primary comparisons, 34% in the Pioglitazone group versus 19% in the placebo group (p = 0.04) showed an improvement in liver histology as defined in the primary outcome [33]. Most importantly, 47% with Pioglitazone versus 21% with Placebo showed a resolution of definite NAFLD activity score (NAS)H (p = 0.001) [33]. Similar to the Vitamin E treatment arm, fibrosis was not affected by Pioglitazone treatment [33]. Adverse events per se were not increased in the Pioglitazone treatment arm; importantly, however, a significant mean weight gain of +4.7 kg at week 96 was seen [33], which however could be part of the therapeutic action (lipid partitioning with the expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissue) [36].",7fadf92e-5f08-4c36-b966-3a611af1c0ac
28,abstract28," While all diabetic patients were excluded from the PIVENS Trial, a randomized controlled trial including 101 patients with either pre‐ or type 2 diabetes found that 51% in the Pioglitazone group (45 mg/day) had resolution of NAFLD activity score (NAS)H and 58% achieved the primary outcome of the study (reduction of ≥2 NAFLD activity score (NAS) points in two histologic categories without worsening of fibrosis), both significantly [37]. Interestingly, in their study, Pioglitazone treatment was also associated with a significant improvement in fibrosis score. However, weight gain was also significantly higher in the treatment group [37].  Nevertheless, it seems that a significant reduction in fibrosis score under Pioglitazone treatment is only seen in type 2 diabetic patients since Bril et al. showed a significant reduction of fibrosis with 45 mg/day. Pioglitazone treatment was only seen in type 2 diabetic patients, not in those with prediabetes [38].",decfd6cd-1eb9-4c08-a854-2349e22822d2
29,abstract29," While the dosage in this study was higher than in the PIVENS Trial (45 mg/day vs. 30 mg/day) duration of therapy was shorter and one could argue that similar results could have been seen in non‐diabetic patients if the study drug dose was higher.  Positive side effects of Pioglitazone treatment being improvement of insulin sensitivity and diabetic control should be weighed against its negative side effects including weight gain, fluid retention, bone loss and a possible increase in bladder cancer [4, 6]. However, as long as weight gain is not due to fluid retention it may be due to induction of a healthy obese phenotype and therefore could be clinically acceptable [36]. Most importantly, Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure [4].",60ac8832-52da-4ca3-8f47-3455ab484435
30,abstract30,"  Finally, the current EASL guidelines [5] state that Pioglitazone “could be used” for the treatment of patients with NAFLD activity score (NAS)H and significant fibrosis, while the AASLD suggests that it “may be used” for treating biopsy‐proven NAFLD activity score (NAS)H patients with and without a type 2 diabetes [6].  Other pharmacological treatment options  Apart from Vitamin E and Pioglitazone, several trials testing mechanistically different types of medication in Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) have been published throughout the last few years and have shown promising results. However, none have yet made their way into national‐ or international guidelines.",60b10322-7f24-4081-9d3c-a88726f6c432
31,abstract31," Nevertheless, we will outline the most important clinical findings in the following chapters, stratified by pharmacological mechanisms of action, while a detailed review of emerging therapeutic targets for Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) can be found elsewhere [39].  GLP‐1 agonists  The glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist semaglutide has shown a significantly higher percentage of patients with NAFLD activity score (NAS)H resolution (and no worsening of fibrosis) compared to placebo in a 72‐week, double‐blind phase 2 trial involving 320 patients with biopsy‐confirmed NAFLD activity score (NAS)H and fibrosis stage 1–340. Improvement in fibrosis stage was seen in 43% of NAFLD activity score (NAS)H patients and 33% of placebo patients, but this difference was not statistically significant [40]. Importantly, around 38% of patients in the study had no (!) diabetes mellitus, however all had at least a BMI >25.",6fd3b0c7-9685-4e1a-80b3-bbd0a87bbea1
32,abstract32," Also of note, the semaglutide dosage used (0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 mg once‐daily) was significantly higher than in its main indication (treatment of diabetes mellitus type II). A previous study investigating the efficacy of the GLP‐1 agonist liraglutide in 52 overweight patients with clinical evidence of NAFLD activity score (NAS)H showed a significantly higher rate of NAFLD activity score (NAS)H resolution in the liraglutide group compared to placebo [41]. Most importantly, 9% in the liraglutide group versus 36% in the placebo (p = 0.04) group showed a progression of fibrosis [41]. A recent meta‐analysis consisting of 11 RCTs that investigated GLP‐1 agonists in Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)D) patients concluded that their overall clinical effect lies mainly in NAFLD activity score (NAS)H resolution rather than fibrosis improvement [42].",0a2aee8e-32d7-49cd-a773-d7c02b11b0fb

Importantly however obeticholic acid improved fibrosis in 35% of patients versus only 19% in the placebo arm (p = 0.004) [46].

Higher values further increase the accuracy for non‐invasively predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH)), whereas in patients with non‐obese NAFLD activity score (NAS)H Advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) a vibration‐controlled transient elastography (VCTE) value ≥25 kPa is sufficient to rule in clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) [72].",40973a3b-2ea8-4264-9346-a90d933f5966

Once the clinical, radiological or histological diagnosis of advanced chronic liver disease/cirrhosis is made every patient should be staged according to widely known disease severity scores for cirrhosis (Child Pugh Score, MELD score), screened for the presence of esophageal or gastric varices [75, 76] and ultimately be classified as either “compensated” or “decompensated” Advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD).",69241dc0-4f38-4f95-bd3b-faa642edcfe0
