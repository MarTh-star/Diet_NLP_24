0,methods0," According to CONSORT guidelines, our study protocol was registered and provided a detailed overview of the methodology before initiation of the study (ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifier, NCT02151669; 26 May 2014).  2.1. Study Design  A randomized, controlled, parallel design was used. The participants were assigned to either the intervention group or the control group by an external investigator. However, given the open nature of the intervention, blinded assignment of the participants and researchers was not feasible.  The DIET study follows the principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki and the ethical and scientific quality standard of the International Conference on Harmonization guidance E6 (R2) for Good Clinical Practice. It also fulfils the requirements established in the legislative framework in Spain for the field of biomedical research, the protection of personal data and bioethics.",f57a5dc1-05ac-448b-85e2-d545322f49a5

Selection of Participants and Randomization  The study population was recruited from patients who visited primary health-care centres of Catalan Institute of Health (ICS, for its Spanish acronym) in the Tarragona district of Catalonia (Spain). The inclusion criteria were men and women aged 35 to 70 years (both inclusive), current smokers with cumulative consumption ≥10 pack-years, internet access and ability to use new technologies (or having someone available to provide relevant assistance). The exclusion criteria were a previous diagnosis of any respiratory disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, etc.",4968f98e-7c9b-4f16-9e1a-d94840a813a3

During recruitment, all individuals received information about the study objectives and the activities related to their participation and signed an informed consent form prior to their inclusion.  2.3. Procedures  The participants were assigned randomly to the control group or the intervention group (1:1), using a centralized process carried out by the Research Support Unit of the IDIAP Jordi Gol based on a simple random number list generated with a computer for this purpose with the EPIDAT 3.0 program (Dirección Xeral de Saúde Pública da Consellería de Sanidade; Xunta de Galicia; Spain).",1657f339-f562-4bcf-93b8-478a32525e86

The complete information contained in the Data Collection Notebook is shown in Supplementary Materials Table S1. In summary form, the Data Collection Notebook includes sociodemographic data, pathological history, smoking habit and clinical examination, which consisted of a basic analytical electrocardiogram, measurement of the expired carbon monoxide levels (expired-CO), and a forced spirometry with bronchodilator test according to the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society and The European Respiratory Society [28].",981ca16d-9941-4e56-82d5-c5dc5dbcdbe3
4,methods4," The dietary-nutritional history of the patient was also obtained, and this history included the results from a questionnaire related to diet and lifestyle, a questionnaire consisting of 14 items related to adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean diet (MEDAS)) [29] and a food-frequency questionnaire consumption (weekly or monthly during the last year) [30]. The Mediterranean diet (MEDAS) questionnaire assigns one point to each item and classifies adherence to the MD as low, moderate or high based on the final score. In addition, a survey of physical activity in leisure time collected the physical activities performed by the participants in the last month and in the last year and the time spent in each activity.",822207b9-7d9e-44e4-a0a1-d4ea61f90d15
5,methods5," The validated version for the Spanish population of the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire [31] and the physical activity classification, which was measured with the short Catalan version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) [32], were used.  All variables were determined at baseline and at the two-year study follow-up visit. All the information was collected in a computerized database, which was accessible only to the study investigators. Access was restricted and controlled by a personal password for each researcher, who was responsible for entering the data of the participants.  2.4. Intervention Group  During the initial visit, the intervention group started the “Programme of Dietetic-Nutritional Education in Mediterranean Diet in Primary Care Centres” applied by a nutritionist and kept a blog (Blog 2.0) for 2 years.",c6afd5c0-f770-4fa2-a24d-8d855621a8e1
6,methods6," This motivational nutrition program was based on an individual intervention to explain the MD pattern and the benefits of following the program.  The MD pattern was described based on the recommendations generated by the Mediterranean Diet Foundation’s Pyramid, the guide for adult populations [33]. This graphical representation was conceived as a simplified pyramid, to be adapted to the specific realities of different countries (e.g., portion sizes) and variations in dietary pattern related to the diverse geographical, socioeconomic and cultural contexts of the Mediterranean region. During the intervention visit, the MD pyramid was used as educational material to discuss the results of the dietary questionnaires. Various educational materials showing food groups adapted to the habits and personal preferences of each participant were also used.",fa8175bb-1512-42db-9669-ac9ca994a247
7,methods7," The main aim of the educational material was to modify the dietary pattern as a whole, rather than focusing on changes in specific foods or micronutrients.  During this visit, the intervention group was also given access to the Blog 2.0 with a personal username and password. This blog was designed ad hoc by the team and its use was exclusive to the study. Participants were advised to log in weekly to get updated information. On the blog they could find information about the different foods that characterize MD and their benefits, cooking habits, modified recipes, examples of standard healthy menus and other topics of interest related to healthy habits.

Study Variables  The main variables of interest are the adherence to the MD and lung function. Adherence to the MD was defined based on the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS) questionnaire, and ≥9 points was considered to reflect high adherence [34]. Lung function was defined according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society and The European Respiratory Society [35]: An anomalous forced vital capacity (FVC) or FEV1 was defined as a value lower than 80% of the predicted value. In addition, an FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio <70% was considered to reflect an alteration.",6216266d-4898-4ddd-86b9-d33723bb710d
9,methods9," Significant changes in the forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1 values between the initial and final visits (>12% and 200 mL) were also considered as decreases beyond what is expected in smokers.  2.7. Statistical Analyses  Our sample size was pragmatic, with the aim of including sufficient participants to ensure an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a two-sided test, recognizing ≥2 units in the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS) [34] as indicating a statistically significant difference, and assuming that the common standard deviation was 3 units. Therefore, based on an anticipated dropout rate of 10%, 40 subjects were allocated to the intervention group, and 40 other participants were assigned to the control group. This sample size, 40 participants in each group, was sufficient to observe significant differences in lung function between the groups (decrease in FEV1 > 10–12 mL/year) [36,37].",3171f11d-3cbc-45c7-851d-eb68fbdff995

Categorical variables are described as frequencies or percentages, and quantitative variables are described as means and standard deviations or medians and 1st quartiles and 3rd quartiles, depending on whether they are distributed normal or not, respectively. A comparison between the intervention group and control group of the baseline values and an analysis of the changes over 2 years were made by using the χ2 test for categorical variables and the Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney U test for quantitative variables, depending if they were normally distributed or not, respectively. For paired comparisons of qualitative variables, McNemar’s test was used.",754595d8-419e-4405-8bba-754d9c38cc3c
11,methods11,"  The difference was calculated by comparing the data obtained from the questionnaires on adherence to the MD and FFQ obtained at the first visit with those obtained at the final visit of the study. In addition, to determine the relationship between the groups for each outcome (variables of lung function and points of adherence to the MD), a multivariate analysis was performed by using linear regression. We obtained three models for each outcome: unadjusted, adjusted by age and sex and adjusted by sociodemographic data, smoking habit, physical activity and anthropometric data.  All analyses were performed by using the statistical package R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; version 4.0.5), according to the intention-to-treat analysis principle and considering a significance level with a p-value < 0.05.  3. Results  A total of 77 participants were included and received intervention; the participants had an average age of 53.5 (9.6) years, and 71.",8c8c638e-e06f-4ca9-8509-bf572a83f9d8
12,methods12,"4% of the participants were women. The cumulative tobacco consumption of all the participants was 23 pack-years, with a daily consumption of 13.5 [10.0; 20.0] cigarettes and a low degree of physical activity (5.7 [2.71; 11.3] hours/week). No significant differences were found between the groups except in age (57.0 (8.81) years in the control group vs. 50.0 (9.34) years in the intervention group; p = 0.001). All sociodemographic data of the participants are shown in Supplementary Materials Table S2. A flow diagram of the study is shown in Figure 1.  Table 1 shows the baseline values and the change after two years obtained for the study population divided by groups. In relation to the anthropometric variables and the results of the laboratory tests and spirometry, it should be noted that the metabolic profile values were optimal and that those related to lung function were within normal values. At baseline, we observed only significant differences in the diastolic blood pressure (80.0 (7.",7ffa2153-53f6-48fa-939a-1e9cb84ca8b0

At the end of the study, we observed significant differences in the total cholesterol (+0.65 mg/dL [−35.13; 15.5] in the control group and −8.85 mg/dL [−15.08; 14.7] in the intervention group; p = 0.046) and LDL cholesterol (−5.51 mg/dL [−40.92; 8.12] in the control group and −10.37 [−20.07; 3.92] in the intervention group; p = 0.012) levels.  In addition, significant differences were not observed regarding adherence to the MD at baseline, which can be considered moderate, and no differences were found between the two groups (8.6 (2.9) points for the control group and 7.9 (1.6) points for the intervention group; p = 0.092). The analysis of the variables at the end of the study showed a significant increase in adherence to the MD based on the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS) questionnaire between the control group and the intervention group (0.69 (2.1) vs. 2.05 (2.03); p = 0.009).",66846cc0-c440-4017-8a6e-38a3845372c6
14,methods14," We also observed an improvement in values measured by using laboratory tests, physical examinations and variables related to lung function, but none of the improvements were statistically significant.  Figure 2 shows the positive answers given by the participants in the 14-item Mediterranean diet (MEDAS) questionnaire. The information shows how the diet of both groups improved significantly after two years of intervention, as indicated by the questions related to the consumption of vegetables and fresh fruits and the consumption of legumes and nuts. Furthermore, the control group exhibited a significant decrease in red wine consumption. The consumption of the other foods did not show significant differences at the end of the study in any of the study groups.  Table 2 shows the result from the comparison of food consumption between the groups. At the beginning of the study, significant differences in fruit consumption (300 [150; 300] in the control group vs. 136 [66.",b72435c1-c79b-4546-b914-abeeddb41af6

Moreover, the consumption of fruit increased after two years in both groups, but a marked increase was found in the intervention group (121 (178) in the intervention group vs. 12.7 (167) in the control group; p-value = 0.008). Although the results showed increases in the consumption of vegetables, dairy products, eggs, legumes, nuts and shellfish and a slight decrease in the consumption of cereals and meat products, the consumption of the rest of the foods did not show significant differences at the end of the study in any of the study groups.  Finally, to analyze the efficacy of the intervention on the changes in diet and lung function, a linear regression was performed, as shown in Table 3. In the unadjusted analysis, the intervention only showed statistical significance in relation to the score reflecting adherence to the MD (β: 1.36; 95% CI 0.35; 2.3; p = 0.",d1f755c0-01f3-459d-be2f-427a22f1ab35

Regardless of this finding, the intervention did not induce significant changes in lung function.  4. Discussion  This novel study investigated the feasibility of a nutritional intervention to increase adherence to the MD and its impact on lung function in smoking patients in primary care centers in the Tarragona health area in Catalonia, Spain. Their results demonstrate that a nutritional intervention based on a dietetic–nutritional education program, and enhanced through Social Networks 2.0, induces a significant increase in adherence to the MD, although a significant impact on lung function was not observed.",7a0142fd-906b-4e34-ad91-cad2ec38e0e0
17,methods17,"  Previous studies have provided evidence showing that higher adherence to the MD improves parameters related to lung function [4]. A recent review reported that a healthy diet, such as DM, could be helpful in improving lung function in patients with respiratory diseases [38]. However, the existence of an association in smoking patients without previous respiratory disease has not yet been demonstrated. Currently, specific interventions to promote an adequate dietary lifestyle in relation to lung health are not fully established. Other studies confirmed the effectiveness of the use of various similar interventions related to the use of social networks in several chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity or metabolic syndrome [39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50]. This study constitutes the first clinical trial that used Blog 2.0 and involves a smoking population without previous respiratory disease in primary care centers.",f47b72d8-2884-40ea-91f4-b498a7f94a86
18,methods18," Previous studies have shown that both a face-to-face dietary intervention and a simple, non-intensive, web-based intervention are useful to increase adherence to DM in the general population [40,41,42] and, therefore, to improve different chronic diseases [43]. For example, several studies aimed to decrease obesity in the population through a web-based intervention with email and/or text message alerts [44,45,46]. On the other hand, there are some studies related to diabetes mellitus [47,48], where the intervention was delivered through an internet-based educational program, together with explanatory videos and group sessions. In addition, interventions aimed at improving diseases related to the digestive tract were found [49,50] wherein internet-based educational interventions and group discussions were used. The blog contents of the present study are part of an educational intervention on DM, which, compared to those described above, is less intensive.",c3bc9ccf-1388-440c-9688-7f8b7455e528
19,methods19," However, this type of intervention, being simple and non-intensive, makes it more feasible in most settings and easier to extend to the general population.  Our previous study, a Westernized dietary pattern and a diet with high alcohol consumption was found to be associated with impaired spirometry values and a higher prevalence of abnormal lung function compared with the results found for participants with adherence to a dietary Mediterranean-like pattern [25]. In addition, the possible beneficial effects of the MD on lung function have been revealed in cross-sectional studies performed with smokers and subjects with different related diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [51,52,53]. However, caution should be exercised because no intervention study has been reported thus far, and to our knowledge, no direct evidence on their effects on lung function in current smokers has been published.",14bbccc2-5c63-4d96-b989-d28a32ae0080
20,methods20," In any case, understanding the impact of the diet on maintaining lung function can increase awareness of the importance of nutritional effects beyond avoiding smoking, as well as provide instructions for future research and strategies to promote lung health and prevent the onset and progression of lung diseases [2,25].  Regarding the effect of diet on lung, although analyzing the effect of individual foods has been valuable, there remain conceptual and methodological limitations because actual meals consist of nutrients that are likely to interact or exhibit synergy with each other [54]. Therefore, dietary patterns provide a framework for examining the health effects of an entire diet. [55,56]. In parallel, dietary quality indices or indicators (dietary quality indices or indicators (DQI)) are algorithms that aim to evaluate the overall diet and categorize individuals according to the extent to which their eating behavior is healthy or unhealthy.",68fce91c-07d0-448e-a422-5c3decc07df3
21,methods21," Predefined indices assess dietary patterns based on current nutrition knowledge and they have been developed primarily for nutritional epidemiology to assess dietary risk factors for noncommunicable diseases [57]. Similarly, the Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)), the Diet Quality Index (dietary quality indices or indicators (DQI)), the Healthy Diet Indicator (Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI)) and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Score (Mediterranean diet (MEDAS)) are the four original diet quality scores that have been developed and most extensively validated [58,59]. Evaluating the dietary habits through questionnaires such as Mediterranean diet (MEDAS), which has 14 items, could provide information about how our dietary habits influence lung health.",0b3ebcde-ea32-4afd-b1cc-58d303dd7f7d
22,methods22,"  As we have commented previously, a dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of refined grains, processed and red meats, desserts, sweets and fried foods is positively associated with an increased risk of pulmonary function diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, even after adjusting for age and total energy intake [60,61]. On the other hand, a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, fish, and whole grains is associated with better lung function in smoking men [62,63]. Recently, a loss of adherence to healthy diets, such as the MD, causing a decrease in the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish and a greater consumption of processed and refined foods, has been suggested to contribute to the higher prevalence of chronic diseases, including lung disease, mainly in developed countries [64,65].  Our results show that a personalized, non-intensive and simple nature of a dietary-nutritional intervention, enhanced through Social Networks 2.",2b27e834-0730-4c3e-b8f9-01ad5b64495f
23,methods23,"0, helps improve adherence to the MD. In the present study, we observed that the dietary pattern of the group that showed higher adherence to the MD was characterized by a higher consumption of legumes, fish, shellfish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, nuts, dairy products, cereals and white meat. At the end of the study, although only fruit consumption showed a significant difference, an increase in the consumption of the abovementioned foods was observed. In contrast, lower consumption of red and processed meat, alcoholic beverages, sugary drinks, light drinks and processed foods was observed in general. In turn, we found that the levels of the variables related to lung function tended to improve. Previous studies have also provided evidence of protective action on pulmonary ventilation parameters, such as forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1 [66,67].",81f1694a-fd73-4122-b722-8a527216c6d9
24,methods24," This finding can be explained by the presence of natural antioxidants and fatty acids in addition to a high content of dietary fiber in foods, such as nuts, which appears able to neutralize the harmful effect of tobacco through the action of various enzymatic antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase [68,69,70].  The present study has several strengths. Our clinical trial constitutes the first analysis of the association of dietary patterns with lung function in the smoking population without previous respiratory disease in primary care settings and thus provides new information that could lead to the clinical application of dietary modification, using the Social Networks 2.0 as a tool to preserve lung function and promote smoking cessation. Furthermore, in our study, we have a low loss to follow-up, which reinforces our results. The explanation for this high follow-up rate could be that the data were collected in primary care centers.",7caa5d36-696f-4a1e-888a-4812d46ee8b7
25,methods25," In Spain, attendance at primary care centers is high (>5 times per year), which could facilitate the follow-up of the study patients [71]. In addition, all patients were followed by the nutritionist, who was in charge of the follow-up at all times during the study. Finally, compared to previous studies, this study provides objective measures for the assessment of lung function through spirometry and post-bronchodilator tests that avoid possible bias.  We must also consider some limitations. Consistent with recommendations on the analysis of feasibility studies, the conclusions should be interpreted with caution because the results may be modified by conducting large-scale studies. As a main limitation, we must mention the sample size of this study and the limited study duration. Our sample size was pragmatic, with the aim of including sufficient patients to confirm the variability of the proposed intervention and a possible impact on lung function.",7f4ebdfd-d373-4827-9ec2-38ffee30e219
26,methods26," The intervention was generally well received, but time was the main barrier to its use. The short intervention time may also have limited the statistical power to detect some differences between the consumption patterns of different foods and the values of the variables related to lung function. Therefore, as previously suggested [25], there is a need to incentivize participation and compensate participants for the time needed to participate in a definitive trial of the intervention. Particularly if the intervention is to be translated into routine practice, the question of which professional will apply the program should be considered. Furthermore, to demonstrate these beneficial effects, a longer intervention time in a larger study population are needed. Currently, our CENIT research group is working on a clinical trial called MEDISTAR [72] with the aim of confirming these results.",a3b1235e-331d-4d51-9465-0e9d2a4c5ba5
27,methods27," Their results may open up the possibility of establishing a nutritional intervention, together with the fundamental recommendation to stop smoking, in this group of at-risk populations.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, our findings show that the nutritional intervention tested in our primary care centre is feasible and effective for increasing adherence to the MD and improving the dietary pattern of the population. Although some evidence suggests that an MD dietary intervention can improve lung function, in our study, we were not able to demonstrate this. Therefore, further appropriate studies are needed to obtain more robust data to confirm the potential benefit of this intervention to improve the diet of smokers before extending the recommendation to general practice.
