Here we developed a microbiota-targeted Mediterranean diet (MED)-based nutritional education program. We targeted the microbiota by increasing and diversifying plant-based foods and dietary fiber intake, and including fermented foods like yogurt daily. To support lifestyle modifications beyond diet, we provided fitness trackers to monitor for daily steps, physical activity, and lifestyle parameters. Finally, as implementing diet and lifestyle modifications can be challenging with difficulties such as acceptance and the need for personalization, we integrated digital health tools including an interactive mobile application.",c95fa42d-c15f-4a28-8095-32b49f6deefa

Of note, two of the 4 couples sharing a household portrayed microbiomes that were more similar to each other than to other study participants and this was correlated with higher adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) and with similarities in their diet (Figure S4).  Differential effects of diet and lifestyle on the microbiome and eukaryome  Host–microbiome interactions were explored by applying Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) (Figure 3a, d; Methods).",5b80fc1e-8af7-4aa5-bfd3-0bde12914280

Multiple bacterial genera, all considered beneficial gut commensals, portrayed absolute post-intervention increases significantly (p < .05, q < 0.2; all with R > 0.4) correlated to increases in Mediterranean diet (MED) daily score (Figure 5), indicating that increased adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) promotes increased microbial loads.

32,discussion1," It provides immediate feedback, thereby helping in creating and preserving lifestyle behavioral changes. The increase in daily Mediterranean diet (MED) score achieved throughout the intervention was associated with improved diet composition, increased dietary fiber intake, and reduced saturated fat and sodium intake, reflecting a reduction in animal-based and ultra-processed foods. In order to target microbiota alterations, we focused on increasing and diversifying dietary fiber intake by scoring the daily consumption of fiber-containing foods, color diversity in the diet and the intake of yogurt as a source of fermented foods, in compliance with recent reports that fermented foods had a greater effect on microbiome than a high fiber diet.12 Interestingly, softer stool texture and changes in gas or bloating reported by the participants might be associated with increasing fiber and yogurt intake.",b2ee8dcc-1a31-49e5-b349-0f152f902e65
33,discussion2," Importantly, adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) increased significantly throughout the intervention but decreased over time, highlighting the need for a long-term maintenance strategy.  Within the 4-week Mediterranean diet (MED) intervention, we detected a reduction in the intestinal inflammatory marker fecal calprotectin, expanding our previous report that adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) is inversely associated with fecal calprotectin in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).6 Additionally, we observed significant reductions in WBC, leucocyte, and neutrophil counts, all within the normal ranges that were inversely correlated with overall adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) and with Mediterranean diet (MED)’s recommended foods. This may suggest that higher WBC, lymphocytes, and neutrophil levels, within the normal ranges, may be biomarkers for an unhealthy lifestyle.",c1fa985b-63e1-4ed1-9355-dd3fe10e927c
34,discussion3," This hypothesis is in line with previous findings showing adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) and its recommended foods is inversely associated with WBC,14 lymphocytes,15 and risk of developing leukocytosis or leukopenia in high cardio vascular diseases (CVD)-risk individuals.16 WBC is a broadly used marker of acute systemic inflammation that has also been investigated as a cellular biomarker of chronic low-grade inflammation, with the potential to serve as a risk marker for cancer, cardio vascular diseases (CVD) and mortality.17–19 Notably, WBC and neutrophil levels were correlated to multiple bacterial genera, including fiber-degrading gut bacteria. This might demonstrate the interplay between host dietary patterns, microbial composition and low-grade inflammation in healthy subjects.",80ffdda0-74a5-4576-a93b-d22e2a0b78ed
35,discussion4,"  Dietary-bacterial interactions in this study formed two distinct co-occurring clusters: a major cluster linking all plant-based foods exclusively with diverse genera of the Clostridiales order, and a minor one linking animal-based and ultra-processed foods with Bacteroides, Barnesiella, Phascolarctobacterium, and Collinsella, some of which were previously associated with high-fat diet.20,21 Interestingly, Collinsella, which was reduced in 16/20 participants in this study (paired-Wilcoxon p-value: 0.03), was shown to play a mediatory role in WBC decrease following Mediterranean diet (MED) intervention in the PREDICT cohort,15 as well as being positively correlated with processed foods and negatively correlated with vegetable consumption.  Unlike the diverse array of bacteria colonizing the gut, few eukaryotic microorganisms are considered possible gut colonizers.",bc6b1492-982f-4de9-aa7d-2c8fe48d689a
36,discussion5,"22 Here, eukaryotic composition was dominated by Saccharomyces, Penicillium, and Aspergillus, and associated mainly with sweets and animal-based foods. We previously demonstrated that starch intake is associated with the abundance of Candida albicans in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).23 In this cohort, Candida prevalence was low (15%; mean RA 0.003), yet, intriguingly, sweets remained a significant factor affecting eukaryal composition. Coupled to our observation that sweets consumption affected the bacterial genera Blautia and Bacteroides, these findings suggest sugars, despite being rapidly absorbed by the host, may exert a substantial effect on the gut microbiome.  Interestingly, the microbial genera Lachnospira and Faecalibacterium were associated with adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) and strongly correlated with the average number of daily steps.",568788cc-20a1-4697-bb64-c75508d07b71
37,discussion6," While previous reports linked between physical activity and increased richness and abundance of beneficial bacteria,24,25 this report highlights the direct association with the number of daily steps. Importantly, we had previously reported that fruit consumption is associated with Lachnospira and Faecalibacterium26 relative abundances, and dietary fiber intake associated with levels of butyrate producing genes,27 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after pouch surgery, implying potential similarities in host-diet-microbiome patterns observed in healthy subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  Increasing adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) lifestyle was associated with increased abundances of fiber degrading and butyrate producing bacteria, as was previously described.",3edbbbc3-e572-43d7-bdb0-8f376123616f
38,discussion7,"8,9,28,29 Host-beneficial microbial activities, such as fiber degradation, butyrate-production and colonization resistance are likely to be biomass-dependent; and reduced bacterial biomass has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).13,30 Here we demonstrate that increased adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) correlates with increased biomass of many beneficial gut microbial genera, such as Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, and Bifidobacterium, suggesting further Mediterranean diet (MED) benefits for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Additionally, our results are consistent with a recent study in first-degree relatives of patients with CD, demonstrating an association between Mediterranean diet (MED)-style dietary cluster, increased abundance of fiber degrading bacteria including Faecalibacterium and lower levels of fecal calprotectin.",00c449c9-9540-40c6-a698-06cb2f947e2b
39,discussion8,"31  The study has several strengths: first, the comprehensive approach to improve lifestyle behaviors using a nutritional education program with dietary counseling and a digital application providing real-time feedback and support. Second, we provided step trackers that enabled us to monitor physical activity, number of daily steps, stress levels, and sleep hours, while setting personal daily goals to gradually increase activity levels. Using digital health interventions may advance healthcare delivery and assist not only in improving lifestyle in healthy participants but also in managing chronic diseases that require frequent medical care and personalized guidance.32–34 Finally, microbiome analysis included an assessment of both relative and absolute abundances, and alongside bacterial microbiome we also assessed eukaryal microbiome to deeper understand host-diet-microbiome interactions.",ed4d27a2-9a30-494e-8d4e-86522be43dbc
40,discussion9,"  We acknowledge several limitations: first, considering the small sample size and lack of a control group, our findings are limited to associations. This comprehensive lifestyle intervention makes it difficult to determine whether the microbial changes were driven by dietary changes, physical activity, or the psychological benefits of participating in a study. In the absence of a control group, there is no guarantee that the effects would have occurred without the intervention. Yet, our results are in line with observational findings associating adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) with increased abundances of beneficial microbial groups and with lower levels of inflammatory markers.11 Second, this was a short-term intervention and we show that adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) was not maintained over time. However, even with this short-term intervention we were able to demonstrate lasting effects in dietary intake.",5c109081-e52b-4ed3-8e50-77554e7decbd
41,discussion10," Longer term dietary and lifestyle maintenance strategies are required to preserve their consequent effects on health outcomes.  In conclusion, a microbiota-targeted Mediterranean diet (MED)-based intervention may contribute to increased adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED), improved diet quality and modification of the gut ecosystem by increasing abundances of beneficial and butyrate producing bacteria, and reducing intestinal markers of inflammation. This approach might be used not only to benefit healthy subjects, but also in the management and prevention of microbiota-associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intervention studies assessing this approach in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are ongoing. ",279c90cc-0167-4336-a348-ef2bed8d65fd
