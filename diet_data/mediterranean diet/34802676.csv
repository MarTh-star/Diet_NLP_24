Chemicals  Rutin, (+)-catechin, 3-caffeoylquinic and 5-caffeoylquinic acids were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), while vitexin, procyanidin B2, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside were from Extrasynthese (Genay Cedex, Genay, France). Water and acetonitrile were HPLC grade while formic acid was HPLC-MS grade and purchased from VWR (Milan, Italy). High-performance liquid chromotography-grade acetone was purchased from Carlo Erba Reagents (Milan, Italy).  3.2. Plant Material and Extraction of (Poly)Phenolic Fraction  The samples were derived from 12 different Italian fig cultivars collected in September 2013 from an experimental plot located in Carmignano (Tuscany, Italy). The overall information of all analyzed fig cultivars is reported in Table 3. The fig fruits were manually peeled, and peel was then freeze-dried (Heto Hetovac VR-1 and CT 110 Vacuum Concentrator, Heto Lab Equipment, Roskilde, Denmark) and subsequently homogenized using a mortar.",f9ded455-6569-4a6f-b96b-98938532ef24
1,methods1," All samples were then stored at −80% until (poly)phenol extraction. Dried fig (poly)phenols were extracted by accurately weighing 200 mg of freeze-dried powder in a plastic tube and by adding 5 mL of a solvent mixture containing acetone/water/formic acid, 80/19.5/0.5 (v/v/v) [10]. Tubes were vortexed for approximately 30 s, sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min, vortexed again for 30 s and finally centrifuged for 10 min at 2575 g. The supernatant was then evaporated through a centrifugal concentrator (SpeedVac SPD121P, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., San José, CA, USA) and the residual pellet was resuspended in 200 μL of 0.1% aqueous formic acid before uHPLC-MSn analyses.  3.3. Analysis of (Poly)Phenols in Fig Peel and Whole Dried Fig through uHPLC-MSn  UHPLC-MSn experiments were performed using an Accela UHPLC 1250 equipped with a linear ion trap-mass spectrometer (LIT-MS) (LTQ XL, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.",6c99ad72-89f5-4ca3-9370-624c3951af33
2,methods2,", Waltham, MA, USA) fitted with a heated electrospray ionization probe (H-ESI-II; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Separations were performed using a Blue Orchid C18 (1.8 μm particle size) column (50 × 2.1 mm (Knauer, Berlin, Germany)). The volume injected was 5 µL and the column oven was set to 40 °C. The mobile phase for gradient elution consisted of 0.1% (v/v) aqueous formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The gradient started with 5% B, held until 3 min, and incremented to 40% B until 12 min, reaching 80% B three minutes later. This 80% gradient held until 16 min, followed by 5 min to re-equilibrate the column from 17 to 22 min.  Untargeted preliminary analyses were carried out in both positive and negative ionization modes.",73a582ba-b891-4d93-90a8-ae4aff0d9f1a
3,methods3," In detail, the MS worked in full scan, data-dependent MS3 mode (m/z range 100–1500) to investigate the anthocyanin profile of fig cultivars owing to dark-violet peel. The MS worked in ESI+ with a source voltage set to 4.5 kV, capillary voltage equal to 20 V while the tube lens voltage was 95 V. The capillary temperature was set to 275 °C with a source heater temperature equal to 300 °C. Nitrogen was used as both sheath and auxiliary gas, with values at 40 and 5 units, respectively. The Collision Induced Dissociation (Collision Induced Dissociation (CID)) was equal to 15 and 35 for MS2 and MS3 experiments, respectively. An analysis in negative ESI mode was performed for all fig cultivars to investigate the profile of non-anthocyanin (poly)phenols. In detail, the MS worked in full scan, data-dependent MS3 mode scanning from m/z 100 to 1500. Source voltage was set to 4 kV, capillary voltage equal to −26 V, while the tube lens voltage was −78 V.",304553f2-a72e-4947-a5d0-38b491b29fda
4,methods4," The capillary temperature was set to 275 °C with a source heater temperature equal to 50 °C. Nitrogen was used as both sheath and auxiliary gas, with values at 50 and 40 units, respectively. The Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) was 30 for both MS2 and MS3 experiments. Pure helium (99.9999%) was used as collision gas. Once the identification through the preliminary untargeted analyses was performed, anthocyanins were quantified in Full MS2 mode by selecting the specific molecular ion (M)+ with a Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) of 35, while non-anthocyanin (poly)phenols were quantified in Full MS2 mode by monitoring the specific (M-H)- with a Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) equal to 30. Chromatograms and mass spectral data were acquired using Xcalibur software 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The LC-MS characteristics of (poly)phenolic compounds are listed in Table S1.",426bc814-5304-4bb2-bb4d-a17c49aab79c
5,methods5," The identification was performed by comparing the MSn ion spectra with the MSn data stored in several online libraries such as PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) (accessed on 16 July 2022); mzCloud (http://www.mzcloud.org/home) (accessed on 16 July 2022); Metlin (http://metlin.scripps.edu) (accessed on 16 July 2022); MoNA—Mass Bank of North America (https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/) (accessed on 16 July 2022) and ReSpect for Phytochemicals (http://spectra.psc.riken.jp/menta.cgi/index) (accessed on 16 July 2022). Additional MSn information was obtained from previous works [10,21,31]. The quantification of fig (poly)phenols was performed by using the proper standard compound or the most structurally related compound, with details reported in Table S1.  3.4. Statistical Analysis  Values were reported as mean ± SE.

Conclusions  The findings obtained in the current study proved that fig peel is a valuable source of (poly)phenols, mainly rutin and 5-caffeoylquinic acid in greenish fig peel, and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside in dark-violet fig peel. Thus, the consumption of unpeeled figs should be encouraged in the healthy population, following the national dietary guidance recommendation, to increase the daily intake of (poly)phenolic compounds. Moreover, since fig peel is also a plant-based by-product readily available in large amounts from the confectionary industry, its possible re-use as a (poly)phenol-rich ingredient in several food products should be considered, also within the framework of environmental impact reduction. Moreover, specifically dark-violet fig peel could be potentially used as a natural colorant.
