0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design This cross-sectional study is part of a randomized controlled trial study of subjects recruited for research on the association between MedDiet, physical activity, physical fitness, and body composition on physical and psychological health in older adults. It is registered at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial (International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial (ISRCTN)); (International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial (ISRCTN)28506133). The cross-sectional study design followed the Strobe Statement.  2.2. Participants The participants were recruited through advertisements on senior centers and presentations in the community of the Region de Murcia (Spain).  A total of 62 participants were recruited (average age: 67.72 ± 8.02). The inclusion criteria were: (a) Having a body mass index between 25 and 29.9 (overweight) or between 30 and 34.9 (obese), (b) women and men over 50 years of age, and (c) who were physically independent.",7c190125-e318-4727-866e-0e5f71a9aea9
1,methods1," Exclusion criteria were: (a) Physical limitations or musculoskeletal injuries that could affect testing of performance, and (b) taking hormonal or steroid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.  Sample size and power were established in connection with a standard deviation for Vo2max from previous data [32]. The sample size for this study consisted of 62 participants, providing a power of 95% and a significance level of α = 0.05; an estimated error of 1.54 mL/kg/min is reported. The Rstudio 3.15.0 software was used to establish the sample size.  2.3. Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate The study obtained approval on CE111908 by the Catholic University of Murcia ethics committee on research and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients signed written informed consent forms prior to participation in the study. This study was conducted at a Sport Science laboratory.  2.4.",441431b8-14c8-4f63-9db8-a624b47a2beb
2,methods2," Variables and Instruments The same researchers performed all the measurements in a single session between 10:00 and 14:00 h. The participants were examined barefoot with the temperature of laboratory standardized at 24 °C. Before the test measurement, the participants did not perform warm-up or stretching exercises. There was a 5-min rest between measurements. In order to establish the reliability of the examiner, prior to the examination, a double-blind study was performed with 30 subjects, obtaining an intraclass correlation coefficient higher than 95%.  Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (AMedDiet): the PREDIMED test was used, an instrument for dietary evaluation that provides information on the AMedDiet of older adults [33], which was previously validated in the Spanish population [34]. The PREDIMED study is a multicenter, randomized, primary cardiovascular prevention trial conducted in Spain (www.predimed.es).",d35df047-a89c-4826-8066-2e8a0f410988
3,methods3," The reliability of this test was verified in a validation test with older Spanish people up to 65 years of age [35].  The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (Global PA Questionnaire (GPAQ)) is a modified version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) [36], and was developed by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) in response to a greater interest in the role of physical activity (PA) on health [37,38]. This questionnaire classifies participants according to activity level as the main objective of physical activity measurement, and allows for the study of trends and associations with other types of behavior or health outcomes.  The maximal aerobic power (Vo2max) was assessed using the 6-min walk test (6MWT). The 6MWT has been shown to be a valid, reliable, objective, inexpensive, and easy test used to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)) [39,40,41,42,43].",ac36399f-43f8-4428-83a3-ef9109dabb45
4,methods4," It is a simple test to perform and is better related to the person’s daily life activities than other tests [41,42]. It is used to measure an individual’s sub-maximum aerobic capacity while walking for 6 min. It is suggested that this test should be performed on a flat surface that allows walking for 20 to 30 m. The subject should be relaxed and wear comfortable clothing and shoes, and the heart rate (HR) of each subject was recorded with a POLAR 400 heart rate monitor just before the start of the test and just after the end. The route was marked every 5 m and cones were placed at the turning area. The subject walked at a pace appropriate to his/her condition, being able to stop or slow down if he/she was fatigued, resuming as soon as possible. The trainer could motivate the subjects with phrases such as “You are doing well”, and the total meters walked was recorded [44]. Vo2 max was calculated with the following formula for men and women: Vo2 max for men = 110.546 + 0.",943cfa48-68d6-474e-adb9-dd0b243c0f7b
5,methods5,"063 × (6 min walk test) – 0.250 × (age) − 0.486 × (BMI) − 0.420 × (height) − 0.109 x (HR); and Vo2max for women = Vo2max = 22.506 − 0.271 × (weight) + 0.051 × (6 min walk test) − 0.065 × (age) [45]. This test has good reliability (ranging from 0.95 to 0.97) [46].  Blood pressure (BP) was measured in the sitting position on the right arm, and the mean of two recordings at least 3 min apart was recorded. Systolic blood pressure (Systolic (SBP)), diastolic blood pressure (diastolic (DBP)), and pulse rate (PR) were measured using a Omron M6, Vernon Hills, monitor [47]. The double product (DP), consisting of the Systolic (SBP) multiplied by the PR, is an index of myocardial oxygen consumption. DP = Heart rate × systolic blood pressure [48]. Mean blood pressure (mean BP (MBP)) was calculated with the following formula: 1/3 (Systolic (SBP) − diastolic (DBP)) + diastolic (DBP). mean BP (MBP) is used in clinical practice and allows blood pressure to be used as a single variable.",454ad3ed-d926-4ff9-ae31-a9be102d0918
6,methods6," mean BP (MBP) has been shown to be a precursor to cardiovascular risk in adults [10].  Body composition measurements with Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) is a method used for body composition measurements for the evaluation of soft tissue composition [49,50]. Dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) (QDR 4500A, fan-beam densitometer, Hologic, Waltham, MA, USA) was used for the measurement of trunk and total fat masses and percentages.  Kinanthropometric parameters were measured based on the standards of the International Society for the Advancement on Kinanthropometry (International Society for the Advancement on Kinanthropometry (ISAK)) [51]. Weight (kg) was evaluated in light clothing without footwear to the nearest 0.1 kg by using an electronic scale, and height (cm) was measured using a stadiometer to the nearest millimeter (Seca 763 digital scale, Birmingham, UK).",d98c5405-d2d6-4549-a443-bd4671a18519
7,methods7," Biiliocristal and biacromial breaths were measured with a large sliding caliper to the nearest millimeter (Realmet, Barcelona, Spain). Waist girth was measured with an anthropometric measuring tape (W606PM, Lufkin, EE.UU.).  Body mass index (BMI), Ponderal Index (PI), biiliocristal/biacromial ratio, and waist/height ratio (waist/height ratio (WHR)) are parameters related to overweightness and obesity [52,53]. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared [54]. PI was calculated as: weight (g) × 100/(height, cm3) [55,56]. Biiliocristal/biacromial ratio was calculated as biiliocristal breath divided by biacromial breath, both in cm [57]. waist/height ratio (WHR) was calculated as waist girth divided by height, both in cm [53].  2.5. Statistical Analyses An analysis of normality of the variables was conducted with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the analysis of sphericity with Mauchly’s test.",f16dab7a-0607-4e14-bb54-9e451f0c9d4c
8,methods8," Data that did not exhibit a normal distribution were subjected to natural log transformation. Data are expressed as means (X) and standard deviations (SD). Pearson’s bivariate correlation coefficients were used to determine the association between age, cardiovascular variables, AMedDiet, physical activity, and cardiorespiratory fitness. For this, the following ranges were established: r < 0.5 for low correlation, 0.5–0.7 for moderate correlation, and >0.7 for high correlation.  Between-group differences (low vs. high AMedDiet; and low vs. high level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)) were examined by independent t-tests. Participants were classified based on the AMedDiet (low/high) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (low/high). In order to ensure a balanced distribution between groups (low vs. high AMedDiet and low vs. high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)), the cut-off points were established based on the mean of each variable (AMedDiet and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)).",d65bbcb9-9a89-4599-af82-6c850fe6e711
9,methods9," The combined effect of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and AMedDiet was assessed by the comparison of means (4 groups) based on one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.  A X2 analysis (categorical variables) was used to analyze the differences between groups. A Cramer’s V post hoc comparison was applied for 2 × 2 tables, and for 2 × n tables a contingency coefficient was applied, showing the value of the statistic and the p value. The maximum expected value was 0.707; with an r ˂ 0.3 showing a low association; a moderate association was defined as an r value between 0.3 and 0.5 and a high association was defined as r > 0.5.  Stepwise multiple linear regression models were used to explore the associations between age, sex, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and AMedDiet with cardiovascular variables (diastolic (DBP), mean BP (MBP), and DP).",7c797f45-4adf-4255-b30a-9927e47381ca
10,methods10," The analysis reported three models: Model 1 for cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), Model 2 for cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and AMedDiet, and Model 3 for cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), AMedDiet, and sex. To analyze whether a nonlinear multiple regression models provided the best explanation of the variance, a curvilinear estimation analysis was used to explore the best model association between the dependent and independents variables. A multiple nonlinear regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between the dependent variable with the independent variables.  Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS (Version 22, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  3. Results Table 1 show the characteristics of the participant.  Table 2 shows the bivariate correlations between age, AMedDiet, physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and correlations between them and BP variables, proportionality, and body composition.",243ec136-f929-43f7-9d1c-e5f4d295f3d5
11,methods11," Age shows a positive and significant correlation with Systolic (SBP), biiliocristal/biacromial ratio, and waist/height ratio (WHR), and a negative correlation with diastolic (DBP), distance in 6 min test, Vo2max, and PI. AMedDiet was correlated with Systolic (SBP) and MVPA. Vo2max was correlated with age, Systolic (SBP), mean BP (MBP), DP, VPA, proportionality, and fat mass.  Table 3 report the result of cardiovascular, proportionality, and body composition according to AMedDiet. Low AMedDiet shows high values Systolic (SBP), mean BP (MBP), PR, DP, BMI, and fat mass, although this difference is no significate.  Participants who reported a high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) showed lower values of Systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean BP (MBP), DP, BMI, PI, biiliocristal/biacromial ratio, and all the variables related with fat mass, significantly (Table 4).",0763d50b-b9a7-4a27-b7a8-6ededb2c20b3
12,methods12,"  The analysis between groups of level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) + AMedDiet shows that the group with low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and low AMedDiet had the highest Systolic (SBP), mean BP (MBP), DP, BMI, PI, waist/height ratio (WHR), and all the variables related to fat mass, significantly. Table 5 shown this and other differences between the variables and groups.  According to the multiple linear regression analysis, Vo2max, AMedDiet, and sex together explained 35.8% of the variation in Systolic (SBP) (Model 3—Table 6). The formula reported for the analysis was: Systolic (SBP) = 2.243 − (0.004*Vo2max) − (0.008* AMedDiet) + (0.047*Sex). The variable prediction Systolic (SBP) was calculated with this formula. The relationship between Systolic (SBP) and prediction Systolic (SBP) was analyzed by means of Student’s t test, showing a correlation of 0.598 (p ˂ 0.0001) and a difference between the values of −0.00008 (Table 6).",7c769351-2dee-41c1-8a92-24cf05bd8d0c
13,methods13,"  In order to analyze if a nonlinear multiple regression models provided the best explanation of the variance, a curvilinear estimation shows that the best association between Systolic (SBP) and Vo2max, AMedDiet, and sex was via a quadratic, quadratic, and linear approach, respectively. The predicted formula was: Systolic (SBP) = a − (b*Vo2max) + (c*Vo2max2) − (d*AMedDiet) + (e*AMedDiet2) + (f*sex). A multiple nonlinear regression analysis was performed as well. Vo2max, AMedDiet, and sex together explained 53.4% of the variation in Systolic (SBP). The formula found for the analysis was the following: 238.611 − (3.63*Vo2max) + (0.044*Vo2max2) − (13.051*AMedDiet) + (0.68*AMedDiet2) + (12.887*sex). The relationship between Systolic (SBP) and prediction Systolic (SBP) was analyzed by means of Student’s t test, showing a correlation of 0.731 (p ˂ 0.0001) and a difference between the values of −0.278 (p = 0.883).  4.",709bdd67-2045-4311-a7ce-6b135124591b
14,methods14," Discussion The focus of the present study was to analyze the association of AMedDiet and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) of various BP components, which can be used to predict cardiovascular diseases in overweight and obese middle-aged and older adults. A strong relationship between diastolic (DBP), Systolic (SBP), mean BP (MBP), and PR, individually or jointly, and cardiovascular disease has been reported in the literature for middle-aged and older adults [10]. Performing regular physical activity and following a healthy eating plan has been recommended for managing high BP and its effects, especially in the overweight and obese [15,16]. The current study found a correlation between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and BP components. In fact, middle-aged and older adults with low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) showed higher Systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean BP (MBP), and DP than middle-aged and older adults with high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF).",6faeb8f2-c886-4ae7-9c81-135ecc2bed65
15,methods15," Previous studies have shown that the increase in Vo2max as a result of aerobic exercise training or combined aerobic and resistance training, produces an independent effect on the decrease of resting and exercise BP [58,59]. In fact, the American College of Sports Medicine has recommended primarily aerobic training to reduce BP [60].  Surprisingly, no correlation was found between physical activity and BP components. Stewart et al. [61] also reported in middle-aged and older adults that BP, and especially diastolic (DBP), had a higher correlation with cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) than with physical activity. This can be attributed to the importance of long-term practice of exercise, with a sufficient training load [62]. However, there was a correlation between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and VPA, although not between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and MPA, in the current study.",58221116-d40d-4e26-86af-c9844d16bd56
16,methods16," In the same way, a correlation between trunk fat and VPA was found, while no correlations with MPA were observed. This is very important due to the importance of trunk fat in BP parameters and cardiovascular disease [58,63]. Previous studies have suggested the superior effect of vigorous exercise for the improvement of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), vascular function and body composition in middle-aged and older adults [58,62,64,65]. Other studies have demonstrated that moderate or vigorous physical activity have different associations on key health parameters. It is possible, therefore, that vigorous physical activity has higher positive associations with the health of overweight and obese middle-aged and older adults. Despite these promising results, questions remain, and further research is needed.",d850b3cb-b9bc-42af-b36e-1a39620e5e5d
17,methods17,"  Eating habits are a changeable variable with a high association with BP, and specifically the MetDiet has shown considerable benefits against hypertension in middle-aged and older adults [18]. One important finding of the current research was that AMetDiet had a negative correlation with a high Systolic (SBP) and the group with a low AMetDiet showed high BP variables, although no significant differences were found with respect to the high AMetDiet group. A possible explanation for this may be that the importance of the association on BP was the degree of AMedDiet, but not to achieve a categorical classification. In fact, previous studies have also found a correlation between AMedDiet and diastolic (DBP) and Systolic (SBP) [66,67,68] or only Systolic (SBP) in overweight and obese people after adjusting for several potential confounders [19].",a88d0139-dd46-4827-a2dd-d97bba742e28
18,methods18," This differs from the findings presented here, where the relation between AMetDiet and diastolic (DBP) could be a consequence of the ages of the participants. In accordance with the present results, previous study has demonstrated that Systolic (SBP) increases with age, while diastolic (DBP) decreases [69]. In this line, Systolic (SBP) has been proposed as superior to diastolic (DBP) in the prediction and evaluation of cardiovascular disease in older adults [10,69,70]. Another possible explanation for this is that fat mass can be associated with greater extent diastolic (DBP) than Systolic (SBP) [19]. Future studies on the association of AMetDiet in diastolic (DBP) and Systolic (SBP) dependent on age and fat mass are therefore recommended.  Besides the correlation between and diastolic (DBP) and Systolic (SBP), a positive correlation was found between age and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and proportionality parameters related with obesity.",08258573-e7ea-40f7-8b67-d2766f86ccea
19,methods19," The same findings have been found in previous studies [61,71], which can be consequence of the aging process [4,5,6]. Furthermore, the PR showed a negative correlation with age, in the same line as previous findings [72].  Body composition plays a pivotal and independent role in BP [58,61]. Although body composition is influenced by physical practice and diet habits [58], increased total fat, particularly abdominal fat, are key features of obese and aging [73]. The results of this study determined that overweight and obese middle-aged and older adults showed healthy values in trunk and total fat and in other proportionality parameters related with obesity [74,75] such as BMI, PI, biiliocristal/biacromial ratio, and waist/height ratio (WHR) when having a high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF).",4e6930de-7b03-4c4b-9d27-b10ee309d4f6
20,methods20," Previous studies have found that aerobic exercise training or combined aerobic and resistance training can change anthropometric parameters and body composition, related to an improvement in BP parameters [58,61]. The same trend was found related with AMedDiet, especially for trunk fat, although differences were not significant. This confirms the results of previous studies whereby body composition changes were higher as related with cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) than with AMedDiet [76,77]. This finding is very interesting, as trunk fat was shown to have an independent association with BP parameters [58], especially with Systolic (SBP), while BMI or PI, which related to body mass and height, were strongly correlated with diastolic (DBP) change [61].",5f83c5d3-2853-4aed-8342-0b0de905f6d1
21,methods21,"  It is interesting to note that when eating habits and physical condition were combined, overweight and obese middle-aged and older adults with low AMedDiet and low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) showed higher Systolic (SBP), mean BP (MBP), DP, fat mass, BMI, PI, and waist/height ratio (WHR) than the group with a low AMedDiet and high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and/or high AMedDiet and high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). This confirms that both aspects are associated with BP variables [2,3], body composition, and proportionality variables related to obesity [58,61,74,75], although cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) seems to have somewhat more importance than diet habits [58,61]. A possible explanation for this might be that overweight and obese people, especially during the aging process, have some hormonal and hemodynamic changes which are associated with hypertension [78] and changes in body composition and physiology of fat [79].",980bc800-af7c-405b-9477-285b19996387
22,methods22," Systematic endurance training, which is highly related with cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) [58,59], has an influence on these parameters [80]. In fact, according to the present results, when cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is low, the AMedDiet is not a relevant factor [76,77]. Despite these promising results, questions remain.  Systolic (SBP) is an important factor of cardiovascular disease in older adults [10,69,70]. In fact, Systolic (SBP) has been proposed as the primary target of antihypertensive therapy [81]. The most interesting finding was that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) was an aspect with a high association with Systolic (SBP), followed by the AMedDiet and sex, and together explained 53.4% of the variation in Systolic (SBP). Previous studies have tried to archive this aim but not in middle-aged and older adults [61,71].",100304d1-8deb-48cc-9d3e-8f6a65b3e3c4
23,methods23," It is not surprising that physical exercise and diet are among the parameters that are most associated with Systolic (SBP), since these lifestyle factors are highly related to higher BP parameters [15,16]. The other factor was sex, with men showing a higher risk of developing hypertension, which confirms the results of previous studies [82]. A previous study tried to archive a prediction model of Systolic (SBP) for young and adults.  The strengths of this study were its multifactorial focus and the sample characteristics. In fact, it is the first study which associated eating habits, PA, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and obesity parameters with BP components of overweight and obese middle-aged and older adults, and the interaction between these variables. Another strength was that it is the first study that analyzed factors that can explain the variation in Systolic (SBP) of middle-aged and older adults.",69740ab0-2f58-41e4-8a81-0f0dad7ce578
24,methods24,"  Concerning the study limitations, this study did not include some variables that could also be associated with BP such as smoking, drinking alcohol, being stressed, sleep quality and quantity, ingestion of salt, or lipid parameters [71]. In addition, this study is not able to corroborate findings with hormonal data. Furthermore, the physical activity was measured with a questionnaire and not with an objective system such as an accelerometer. Another limitation was that due to its cross-sectional design, causal associations could not be established.  5. Conclusions Middle-aged and older adults who are overweight and obese show the existence of correlations between age, AMedDiet, cardiovascular variables, PA, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Furthermore, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as an independent factor and combined with AMedDiet can influence BP, body composition, and proportionality in middle-aged and older adults who are overweight and obese.
