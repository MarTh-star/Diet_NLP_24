0,methods0,"This study consisted of 2 phases, the first was a process evaluation to assess the acceptability of the AusMed diet program resources and materials in a population of older Australians. The second phase was a 2-week feasibility trial of the diet program itself. Figure 1 displays an overview of the study processes. All participants provided written, informed consent prior to participation in each phase. This study was approved by the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee, (#H-2018-0217). Phase 1 was conducted in September 2018 and Phase 2 took place between February and March 2019.  2.1. Phase 1 Process Evaluation The process evaluation of the AusMed diet program materials used a mixed-methods approach. Data were collected from a sample of older Australians (>55 years) to assess the acceptability of the program materials.",46ebf82f-6e28-4eaa-9039-1829254c8e4e
1,methods1," Quantitative data were collected via surveys conducted after presentation of the AusMed diet program materials at a consumer research group session and qualitative data were collected from follow-up semi-structured telephone interviews.  2.1.1. Phase 1 Participants Seventeen participants were recruited—12 from a retirement community using their closed resident email and Facebook™ groups and 5 using convenience sampling. Inclusion criteria were that participants be over the age of 55 years and able to attend the University of Newcastle Food Science Laboratory for a 2–3 h consumer research group session. As there was a food sampling requirement within the session, participants were excluded if they had a diagnosed food allergy to nuts, eggs or seafood, had a diagnosed/reported food intolerance to gluten or dairy OR reported any other dietary restriction such as a gluten free or dairy free diets.  2.1.2.",32d72eb4-4485-43f9-940f-cc2f536c0d5c
2,methods2," Phase 1 Study Design Participants were invited to attend consumer research sessions at the University of Newcastle Food Science laboratory. Background data were collected via a paper-based survey on arrival which included demographic information as well as diet/food preparation-specific information and confidence level in food preparation. Participants were also asked to indicate whether they would be willing to complete a follow-up individual semi-structured interview. Participants attended a single session lasting 2–3 h, where a trained moderator presented the AusMed diet program materials divided into three sections:The AusMed education materials—background, diet–disease relationship, staple foods, plate ration and food pyramid.  The AusMed diet program itself—menu plan, recipes, shopping lists, troubleshooting the menu plan.  Foods typical to the Mediterranean diet—cooking demonstration and sample tasting of three recipes from the program.",4d07c02c-0c60-441a-a21d-c4ba8fd00960
3,methods3,"    Evaluation survey data were collected from participants after each presentation section. Likert scales were utilised to assess participants’ opinion of the acceptability of the materials and their confidence in their capability of following the AusMed diet program. Participants indicated their agreement with five statements with a score ranging from one, indicating strong agreement, to five, indicating strong disagreement. Participants could also provide written comment at the end of each survey section.  Following consumer research group sessions, those willing to participate in the semi-structured telephone interviews were given an information statement which included advice that member checking (provision of the qualitative data collected via their individual telephone interview for respondent feedback) would not be feasible due to time constraints of the project but that they could redact or alter any part of their interview.",3d4d37ae-30f7-4527-8736-b1341e7de120
4,methods4," Informed consent was then provided, and interview times were scheduled.  Individual semi-structured telephone interviews lasting 12 to 21 min were conducted with (n = 6) participants to provide in-depth qualitative data on the acceptability of the AusMed materials. Participants were selected in order of response to the interview request and were from across the 3 consumer research groups. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim via Temi (an iOS application) using a proprietary algorithm and voice-recognition software. No human had access to the recorded files. The site is secured via TLS 1.2 data encryption and the files are deleted permanently from the server post delivery of the transcription Word document to the researchers via email. The transcription document was checked against notes and the memory of the interviewer for accuracy.  Interviews were shaped by a topic guide including nine questions with prompts.",cd1ec320-059e-4a4e-9b8a-a95d46c9c27c
5,methods5," Interview questions were open ended and included topics such as the participant’s opinion of the physical materials (ease of reading, font size, colour), knowledge of the foods presented in the program and their likelihood of consumption, self-efficacy in terms of their capability to access foods, shop and prepare dishes, barriers or enablers to the participants perception of their ability to change dietary patterns and any suggested improvements to the program or materials. They were asked to indicate whether the program materials had encouraged them to change their diet. Interviews were repeated until data saturation was reached and no new themes or key points emerged.  2.1.3. Phase 1 Outcome Measures Data from the three evaluation surveys of the consumer research group presentations were collated and quantified using Excel and analysed using descriptive statistics. This information was then used to refine the structure, questions, probes and prompts of the telephone interviews.",904b01ec-4cbb-4662-a088-2bc85768533c
6,methods6,"   The transcribed data from the semi-structured telephone interviews and the individual participant comments from the surveys were analysed using standard 6 phase qualitative thematic analysis to extract common themes utilising NVivo software: 1. familiarisation of data; 2. coding; 3. extracting themes; 4. review of themes; 5. defining the themes; 6. writing—contextualising themes in relation to existing literature [16]. This process was iterative and repeated sweeps of the data were conducted to ensure that any meaning derived was supported. A second researcher reviewed the thematic analysis to confirm the findings.   2.2. Phase 2 Pilot Trial of AusMed Diet Program As a result of the information gathered from Phase 1 of the study, the AusMed diet program was modified to include weekly menu plan and shopping list templates and an education session to enable participants to individually tailor the program.",667b48ff-0d01-4a18-939b-9a0fc6918461
7,methods7," A text message support system was created using the Behaviour Change Wheel and COM-B model (which utilises a person’s Capability, Opportunity and Motivation to elicit a change in behaviour) in order to design the message strategy [17] and provisioning for the staple foods hamper to the AusMed diet program was made.   2.2.1. Phase 2 Participants Participants in Phase 1 of the study were recruited for a 2-week trial of the AusMed diet program. Of the Phase 1 participants (n = 17), 13 participants provided written, informed consent to trial and 4 participants dropped out due to travel commitments. A further 2 participants were recruited via word of mouth, giving a total of n = 15 participants for the trial.   2.2.2. Phase 2 Study Design Phase 2 was a trial of the AusMed diet program. Participants attended a single face-to-face group session of 2–3 h where a trained moderator delivered the AusMed diet program trial in 3 parts; 1. education materials, 2.",f700f042-d389-45b7-b39b-fa15b608f7a9

Participants received instructions on the timeframe for completion of the 2 week trial of the AusMed diet program and completed a pre-trial validated 14-point Mediterranean Diet Score [18]. Participants were provided with a sample 2-week menu plan and shopping list, an associated recipe book and a staple foods hamper to the AusMed diet program including olive oil, nuts, wholegrains, spices, tinned tomatoes and legumes. Other resources included education material, troubleshooting advice for recipe modification, recommended daily/weekly servings of core food groups and templates to create their own meal plan and shopping list.  For the following 14 days, participants followed the diet program and received twice weekly text messages designed using the COM-B model [19], with a goal to support behaviour change and increase adherence (supplementary Table S1).",23c8166c-736b-4983-8dec-e29eee1774c1
9,methods9," Participants were sent post intervention emails with the Mediterranean Diet Score survey and evaluation surveys to assess the food and text message components of the program.   2.2.3. Phase 2 Outcome Measures Phase 2 outcomes measures were a change in adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern. We calculated the mean and standard deviation for the change in overall diet score and each numerical variable of the validated 14-point Mediterranean Diet Score and the percentage for the two categorical variables, and then tested for significance using paired t-tests and Fisher’s exact test (p < 0.05 = significant). Data from the food and text message surveys were collated and quantified using excel and analysed using descriptive statistics.  3. Results 3.1. Participant Characteristics In total, 17 participants attended one of the three consumer research groups and 15 participants completed the trial of the AusMed diet program.

The majority of participants reported that they were either confident or very confident in all aspects of food preparation when surveyed prior to the research group presentation. All participants reported feeling confident or very confident in all aspects of accessing foods (transportation, list making and shopping) and recipe reading. In terms of preparing food for consumption, 18% of participants reported that they were neutral or not confident in cooking from a recipe. However, 94% felt confident in preparing meals for the day (Supplementary Figure S1).   3.2. Phase 1 Quantitative Analysis 3.2.1.",c66bdf19-3068-4db4-a2c0-c52b389cd5f0
11,methods11," Phase 1 Nutrition Education Materials Survey All participants (100%) indicated that their knowledge of the Mediterranean diet, its health benefits and their confidence in making dietary changes to reflect a Mediterranean diet pattern had improved after presentation of the AusMed education materials. Responses are shown in Figure 2.  3.2.2. Phase 1 Program Materials Survey All participants agreed that the physical materials were easy to understand and visually appealing and that they would be able to use the materials to adjust the meal plan for individual taste preferences while still maintaining the integrity of the program. More participants indicated a preference for a booklet format (70%) rather than an electronic version (57%) and a group setting (strongly agree 29%, agree 29%, disagree 12%, and strongly disagree 0%) rather than individual delivery (strongly agree 27%, agree 0%, disagree 33%, and strongly disagree 13%).",d588ea0a-3c9b-4ffe-934f-b9df7a63d485
12,methods12," The majority of participants agreed that provision of a staple foods hamper would aid in adherence (76%). Responses are shown in Figure 3.   3.2.3. AusMed Foods Survey Phase 1 Participants completed this survey after a presentation of the recipes, a cooking demonstration and tasting. All participants indicated that they were familiar with foods represented in the AusMed diet program. The majority of participants (89%) reported that their current diet includes some of the foods found in the program and that there were no foods on the program that they would not eat (76%). All participants had confidence that they could access the foods, make the recipes, enjoyed the taste, would feel satisfied by the food and felt confident that they had the ability to follow the program. Participant responses are shown in Figure 4.  3.3. Phase 1 Qualitative Analysis All interviewees had positive feedback for the program materials and found them clear and easy to follow.",62f60ee8-0fda-4958-9ea4-1726ec3c4880
13,methods13," They also confirmed a willingness to adhere to the AusMed diet program, were confident in their ability to cook the recipes and were willing to experiment with new ingredients. One interviewee did suggest that it was difficult to make a definitive statement of confidence without actually utilising the materials in practice. “I guess you don’t really know for sure until you try to follow. It’s the doing of the thing isn’t it, that makes you realise what works and perhaps where the improvements are?” (Participant 6).    Detailed thematic analysis of transcribed interviews revealed three common themes—1. barriers to adherence, 2. additional program support and 3. simplification and individualisation of the program materials to improve adherence. Thematic analysis is summarised in Table 2.  3.4. Phase 2 Quantitative Analysis 3.4.1. The 14-Point Mediterranean Diet Score Change in intake can be found in Table 3. Overall, the mean (± SD) baseline Mediterranean Diet MD score was 5.4 ± 2.38.",e310fd11-f69b-41a3-a561-ccba5444f1f9
14,methods14," After the 2-week dietary intervention, the mean Mediterranean Diet MD score increased by 4.2, to a total score of 9.6 ± 2.03 (p = < 0.001). All mean scores for each individual criterion showed improvement from baseline—except for nuts, which remained the same at 3.53 (±1.96). Post intervention, all participants were using Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)) as their main source of culinary fat and had made a significant increase in their intake, from a mean 1.15 (±0.86) to 2.53 (±1.19) tbsp/day (p = 0.001). Significant increases in intake were also found in vegetable (p = < 0.001), legume (p = < 0.001), fish (p = 0.009) and sofrito (p = 0.013) intakes. Sofrito is an example of the synergistic effects of cuisine from the Mediterranean dietary pattern and includes ingredients such as olive oil, tomato, onion and garlic, which synergistically enhance the nutritional value of their individual components when combined [20].",6f2a981f-a3ee-4fed-8b23-e43995ade122
15,methods15," Participants also significantly decreased their intake of red meat (p = 0.015) and commercial sweets and pastries (p = 0.021). All other food groups showed non-significant trends towards an increase in intake.  3.4.2. Phase 2 AusMed Foods Survey  All participants reported that they were confident in their ability to maintain the diet program post intervention. They enjoyed the taste of the foods (67% strongly agreed) and felt satisfied for the duration of the intervention (67% also strongly agreed). Responses were varied as to whether there were foods within the program that they would refuse to eat, with 47% agreeing that there were, 13% remaining neutral and 40% disagreeing. Responses are shown in Figure 5.  3.4.3.",2d43c9e8-5dc9-45f9-be91-c0da16cadb49
16,methods16," Phase 2 Text Message Support Evaluation Survey The majority of participants agreed that the text messages delivered to support behaviour change and adherence were of an appropriate length (100%), frequency (99%), timing (87%) and were beneficial in achieving their goals (87%). Responses were varied as to whether messages aided confidence for continued adherence—57% agreed and 47% were neutral. Responses are shown in Figure 6.  4. Discussion These results provide preliminary trial evidence of the feasibility of a Mediterranean diet program designed to be specific to an older Australian population. In the Phase 1 process evaluation, participants found that the AusMed diet program materials were easy to use and increased their knowledge and confidence to adhere to a Mediterranean diet pattern.",c9314983-f323-41ca-af00-b127bec56709
17,methods17," Qualitative analysis identified the complexity of the meal plan, individual food preference and cost to be barriers to adherence, differing from commonly perceived barriers of motivation, time and cost [21]. These differences may be explained by participant demographics (Table 1). The majority of participants were not engaged in full-time work and 85% reported a household income above the highest possible aged pension of $32,210/year [22], meaning time and cost are less likely to be a barrier.  Phase 1 qualitative analysis found that feasibility may be improved with additional support and the simplification/individualisation of program materials. Nutrition education and social support have been identified as strategies that are predictors of adherence to a health behaviour change program for an ageing population [23,24].",ce0b094e-d362-4b4e-9d20-0cd59ef55feb
18,methods18," Participants identified a group setting and utilising mHealth strategies (the use of mobiles technologies such as phones or tablet devices in health practice) [25] to support nutrition education and behaviour change as preferable methods.   As a result of data collected in Phase 1, changes were made to the AusMed diet program including the addition of meal plan and shopping list templates and the development of a presentation on their use. This allowed for simplification and individualisation of the program. Interventions that increase the self-efficacy of participants have been shown to be effective in increasing adherence and can be a reliable predictor of behaviour change in an older population [26]. Individual tailoring of dietary interventions and meal plan flexibility has been shown to be a key strategy to improve adherence [27].",176ded68-ab39-4514-9231-7c65d5820691
19,methods19," A large Mediterranean diet cohort study (n = 10,376) showed that similarity between the macronutrient profile of the participants usual diet and the intervention resulted in longer-lasting adherence [28] and it was thought that tailoring an intervention to decrease this gap could improve adherence. The use of menu plan templates allows participants to create a plan similar to their current eating pattern (and macronutrient profile) while still maintaining the nutrient structure of a Mediterranean dietary pattern.  Text message support was also included in the modified program. Participants had a positive response to messages and felt that they aided adherence but had a mixed response in terms of their aid in improving confidence to continue the program.",c4841111-427c-41ae-97a0-1c3da48a2985
20,methods20," A recent Cochrane review in utilising text message support for preventive health (n = 1933) [29] and a meta-analysis of the use of text message support for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (n = 949) [30] found that while text messages may support preventive health care, evidence is too limited to draw reliable conclusions. A meta-analysis published recently shows promising results in the use of tailored text message support for self-management of type 2 diabetes (n = 949), delivering a significant improvement in HbA1C values [g = 0.54 (95% CI: 0.009, 0.99); p = < 0.0001)] [31]. Tailoring of the text message support using individual learning goals and the COM-B framework may improve its efficacy in subsequent trials.  In Phase 2 pilot testing of the AusMed diet program, a population of older Australians were able to improve their adherence to a Mediterranean style diet. An adherence of ≥ 10 is considered ‘excellent’ [18,32].",9b14534e-3613-4e50-8c78-f0ae3bd40394
21,methods21," Participants’ mean score improved from a baseline of 5.4 (±2.32), which is considered to be ‘fair’ adherence, to a post intervention score of 9.4 (±2.03), which is considered ‘good’ adherence [18,32]. While trial adherence was not considered to be ‘excellent’, the comparative scores were validated in a Spanish population and, as such, may have had a closer adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern at baseline [32]. It is important to note that two participants in the Phase 2 trial had not participated in Phase 1 and, as such, may have had a different understanding of the AusMed which may have influenced results.  Participants reported a significant increase in the consumption of foods that have been shown to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) (relative risk 0.83, 95% CI 0.77, 0.89), legumes (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.98) and vegetables (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.",70ca3274-af8a-435f-b264-755038ad4082
22,methods22,"98) [33], and a significant reduction in foods that have been shown to increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, red meat (RR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.07) and commercial sweets [34,35]. A longer trial with increased behaviour change support is needed to show whether adequate intake can be achieved in the long term in order to see health benefits.  Participants’ responses to the foods from the AusMed diet program were generally positive. All enjoyed the taste, found the recipes easy to make and were satisfied by the foods in the program. The majority reported increased self-efficacy and confidence in their ability to maintain adherence post intervention. Palatability and satisfaction are linked with higher compliance to a Mediterranean diet pattern [8,13].  There is merit to using a mixed-methods approach to evaluate dietary program feasibility in order to improve design prior to a larger intervention trial to increase adherence.",27bef3a4-d4d2-4367-8db5-58be0036b612
23,methods23," Quantitative survey and adherence data give baseline statistics and a measure of participant confidence, while the qualitative analysis provides in-depth data on the individual opinion of each facet of the program and potential barriers to acceptability. This provides the opportunity to create program materials that address those barriers to increase adherence in a larger trial. The use of a retirement community for recruitment proved effective and further research of this as a method of increasing engagement with health behaviour change programs may beneficial.  There are, however, limitations associated with the data in this report. The population was small, which limits statistical power (n = 17 in Phase 1 and n = 15 in Phase 2), and may not be representative of older Australians in general. The sample was a ‘well’ population of higher socioeconomic status and education level and, as such, may not be generalized to older Australians.",7530e8ac-d8f5-47da-b923-f7cf25d9a626
24,methods24," At baseline, they reported a high level of confidence in their ability to access and prepare food. They were also motivated to attend a 2–3 h presentation away from home—all of which may not be indicative of the predicted adherence of an average older Australian population. Intervention intake data were self-reported and, as such, may be subject to bias. A Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) or 24 h recall would give a more detailed and robust description of adherence. A trial length of 2 weeks is not indicative of long-term adherence and there was no control group. While we collected baseline data, there is inherent bias in the lack of a control group for comparison.  5. Conclusions  In this study, a population of older Australian’s were found to improve their adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern modified to be specific to the Australian context.",d0eb7e78-295a-4370-8f0e-158073dd8add
25,methods25," Data collected were suggestive of the feasibility of the AusMed diet program and this preliminary data will be used to inform a future intervention in the efficacy of a Mediterranean diet program modified for a population of Australian stroke survivors utilising mHealth. Larger randomised controlled trials conducted over a longer period with a sample from across a broader range of older Australians (including those from various socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds) are needed to confirm whether the AusMed diet program can increase adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and whether there are associated health benefits for older Australians.
