0,background0,"Excessive dietary intakes of sodium (Na) along with insufficient potassium (K) intakes are related to risk of developing cardiometabolic disorders [1, 2]. The ratio of Na to K is now suggested as a more reliable index to assess the risk of cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD)) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD)-related mortality than either Na or K intake alone [3]. Urinary Na-to-K ratio has been shown as a strong predictor of hypertension (hypertension (HTN)) and cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD)) [4–7]. The ideal Na-to-K ratio of diet still remains a matter of debate, due to controversy about the ideal level of Na and K intakes; the value of ~ 0.5 derived from the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) and US–Canada recommendations (i.e., 2000 mg/day of Na and 3500 mg/day of K and 2300 mg/day Na and 4700 mg/day K, respectively) has been suggested [8, 9], however a ratio of < 1.",500919cb-85f8-48d2-8334-f00828db3f7e
1,background1,"0 has been identified as a best balance of Na and K intakes for preventing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and all-cause mortality [10].  Non-urinary-based dietary assessments methods (e.g., 24-h food recalls, Food Frequency Questionnaire) and measurement of urinary Na and K concentrations, in both spot and 24-h samples, are the most common methods for estimation of dietary Na and K intakes [11, 12]. Although measurement of Na and K in 24-h urine is the gold standard method to estimate their dietary intakes, low feasibility in population-based studies and incomplete collections, resulting in underestimation of NA–K intakes, is the major limitation of the method [13]. In contrast, spot urine sampling has a negligible risk of collection errors and is less burdensome and more cost-effective than 24-h urine sampling, which makes this method more practical, especially for population-based surveys [12].",3154e21b-5cdf-404d-8c9b-06f7dc48d517
2,background2," There are a number of studies suggested spot urinary Na and K as a simple, non-invasive, useful and alternative method to 24-h urine estimation in populations [14, 15].  Current evidence regarding the prognostic relevance of urinary Na-to-K ratio, as an indicator of diet quality in population-based studies is limited. Few observational studies have investigated the association between urinary Na-to-K ratio and dietary patterns [16, 17]. In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether spot urinary Na-to-K ratio could be related to habitual dietary patterns, and how the index can be used as an indicator of diet quality among a general population.

Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) is a community-based study that was initiated in 1999 with 15,005 individuals, aged ≥ 3 years, and data collection is ongoing every 3 years to assess changes of non communicable diseases (NCD) risks [19]. For the current analysis, we recruited 1864 adult men and women (age ≥ 19 years) from the sixth examination of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) (2014–2017); participants with complete data on spot urinary values (Na, K and creatinine), demographics, anthropometrics, biochemical measurements and dietary intakes were included.",d2a90807-258e-40d0-b564-d32b04459ada

Anthropometric and demographic measures Weight was measured by digital scales (Seca, Hamburg, Germany), height and waist circumference were measured by a tape meter, measurements were reported to the nearest of 100 g and 0.5 cm, respectively. Waist circumference was measured at the level of the umbilicus. Subjects were minimally clothed and without shoes for anthropometric measurements. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height in square (m2).  Systolic (Systolic (SBP)) and diastolic (diastolic (DBP)) blood pressures were measured using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer calibrated by the Iranian Institute of Standards and Industrial Researches [20].",39f3c878-a360-492a-885b-8f9203a54625
5,methods2," Blood pressure was measured twice on the right arm of the participants, after a 15-min rest in a sitting position, with at least a 30-s interval between two measurements. Mean of the two measurements was considered as the participant’s blood pressure.  Biochemical measures Both blood and spot urine samples were obtained between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. following overnight fasting. Urinary concentrations of Na and K were measured using flame photometry (Screen lyte, Hospitex Diagnostics, Florence, Italy). Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variations (CVs) were ≤ 2.8% for Na, and ≤ 4.8% for K.  Fasting plasma glucose (Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)) and triglycerides (TG) levels were determined by the enzymatic colorimetric method, using glucose oxidase and glycerol phosphate oxidase, respectively.

Both inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variations (CVs) were ≤ 5%.  Dietary assessment Dietary assessment was done using a validated 147-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)), intake frequency of each typical food item over the previous year documented on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis in household measures [21]. Since the Iranian Food Composition Table (Food Composition Table (FCT)) has limited data on the nutrient content of raw foods and beverages, the US Department of Agriculture’s (US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA)) Food Composition Table was used to analyze foods and beverages for their energy and nutrient contents.",63ae52a7-be3c-478a-b0be-306bb41b3205
7,methods4," For the traditional Iranian foods not available in the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) table, the Iranian Food Composition Table (FCT) was used as an alternative. Validity and reliability of the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) have previously been reported [22].  Identification of dietary patterns and calculation of dietary scores To obtain major dietary patterns, the principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) with varimax rotation was conducted, based on 18 predefined food groups (i.e., whole grains, refined grains, starched vegetables, non-starched vegetables, fruits, beans, high-fat and low-fat dairy, red meat, poultry, vegetable oil, hydrogenated and animal fat, fast foods, salty snacks, sweet snacks, sweetened beverages, nuts and seeds, tea and coffee).",bb9594ed-b708-41ad-a9c5-be0638b74d8c
8,methods5," principal component analysis (PCA), a posteriori (data-driven) approach, is the most commonly used method to derive dietary patterns; this method is a variable-reducing procedure based on correlation or covariance matrices of the original variables, creating linear combinations (components, factors, or patterns) [23].  We considered eigenvalues > 1, the scree plot and the interpretability of the patterns, and 2 factors were obtained. Although all food groups contributed to the pattern score calculation, food groups with an absolute component loading ≥ 0.30 were selected to describe the pattern. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin statistic, a measure of sampling adequacy, was 0.67 (values > 0.6 indicate the usefulness of cluster analysis using our data), and the P value for Bartlett’s test of sphericity was < 0.001 supporting the use of cluster analysis as an appropriate procedure.",d956b779-bdfb-44e1-84cc-2d6b7940212b
9,methods6," Factor scores were calculated using the sum of intakes of the standardized food groups weighted by their respective factor loadings on each pattern.  To estimate Mediterranean dietary pattern scores, we used an index variable that was composed of 8 Mediterranean food groups. The score was proposed by Trichopoulou et al. [24] and its validity was evaluated in previous studies [25]. In brief, consumption of food groups (vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish and MUFA/SAFA) were scored according to median intake values of the study population (i.e., score 0 and 1 for intakes below and above the median). For total red meat, if the subjects consumed more than median, we assigned score 0 and if they consumed less than median, a score of 1 was assigned. Finally, after adding up the individual component scores, overall Mediterranean dietary pattern score ranged from zero to eight [26].",3998e7c8-d7e9-4a7f-abc2-041dd5e22b4e
10,methods7,"  To estimate Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, eight food-derived components including high intakes of fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, low-fat dairy, and whole grains, and low intakes of sodium, sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats, were considered. For each of the eight components, all participants were categorized into fifths according to their intakes ranking. For components in which higher intakes are desirable (i.e., fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, low-fat dairy, and whole grains), individuals received the maximum score of 5, if their intakes were in the highest quintile. The remaining components (i.e., sodium, sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats) were reversely coded. Intakes of the components between minimum and maximum amounts were scored proportionally. Finally, scores were summed to a total Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score that ranges from a minimum of 8 o to a maximum of 40 points [27].",db22267d-991a-42d7-8b56-c6bdbdcd232d
11,methods8," This scoring system of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was used in same population [28, 29], and its validity was assessed elsewhere [30].  Statistical analyses General characteristics and dietary intakes of participants were compared across tertiles of urinary Na-to-K ratio, using the one-way ANOVA and Chi-square tests, for dichotomous and continues variables, respectively. To assess potential association of dietary patterns scores with urinary Na-to-K ratio, linear regression models, adjusted for potential confounders were used. To identify the potential confounding variables, univariate regression was used and the variables with PE < 0.2 were selected to enter the models. Finally, confounders adjusted in models included sex (men/women), age (year), Body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), and total energy intake (kcal/day).

17,discussion1,"  In our study, healthy dietary patterns identified as Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, were related to a lower urinary Na-to-K ratio, as a risk factor of cardiometabolic disorders. Our findings are in line with those of previous studies showed that the Japanese dietary pattern, heavily loaded for fish and vegetables, was positively associated with urinary K concentration [16], and studies reported a significant inverse association between “nuts, seeds, fruits and fish” dietary pattern with urinary Na-to-K ratio [17]. Subjects with a higher Mediterranean dietary pattern score had better nutrient profiles, with lower sodium and higher potassium intakes [31]; similarly, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet provides high amounts of potassium and a restricted amount of sodium (~ 1500 mg/day) that results in a urinary Na-to-K ratio less than 1 [32, 33].",5e3b0168-0490-46d3-b07c-74cdd677e720

Although measurement of 24-h urinary Na and K is considered as the gold standard method for assessment of their dietary intakes, it is difficult and rather inconvenient for population-based studies to collect 24-h urine without any loss of urine; reports show that the rate of unsuccessful collection of 24 h urine samples is about 40% [15]. Furthermore, much attention has been focused on estimating Na and K intakes using the ‘spot’ urine sample [37], as collection time of the spot urine samples has no restriction [38, 39]. There are a number of confirmed formulas to estimate 24-h urine Na-to-K ratio, using spot urine values of Na and K, in some cases using creatinine values [15, 37]. Pearson correlation coefficients of 24-h urinary Na-to-K ratio and spot urine Na-to-K ratios across the Western/Asian populations were r = 0.88 to 0.",98afb337-7a2a-41ce-80fc-324c8bcd021a

A benefit of the spot urine Na-to-K ratio (compared to Na or K per se) is that no conversion into 24-h excretion values is needed, a factor that usually results in imprecision [12].  The strengths of the present study include its relatively large sample size, use of a validated comprehensive Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) to assess dietary intakes, and evaluating the association between four dietary patterns and Na-to-K ratio, simultaneously.",f3c55e00-a65a-4974-a5c9-f08afde0352d
21,discussion5," Although spot urine sample is a simple and low-burden method to estimate 24-h urine concentrations, it has some limitations due to the potential inter- and intra-individual variations of urinary excretions of Na and K, and effect of time of sampling; using spot urine samples may be limited due to circadian rhythms of Na excretion [12].  Taken together, our findings indicates that spot urinary Na-to-K ratio may be used as a simple, non-invasive and inexpensive method to monitor diet quality, especially in population-based studies. The urinary Na-to-K ratio may also be used to track adherence of dietary recommendations in nutrition clinical trials, in which changes of dietary patterns of the participants during the study period is targeted. However, future studies are needed to approve the performance of spot urine Na-to-K ratio as a reliable method of assessing diet quality.",b8f774ce-3262-4c80-8540-9a1b0037083b
