There is evidence that cancer may surpass cardiovascular diseases as the leading cause of premature death in the vast majority of countries within the present century [1,2].",14e12e69-296c-4682-b1da-0dcf65f95861
3,abstract3," According to the GLOBOCAN, which is produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)), global rates of cancer incidence and mortality were found to increase when comparing 2018 data with 2020 data, respectively rising from 18.1 to 19.3 million new cases and from 9.6 to nearly 10.0 million deaths [3,4]. This epidemiologic behavior implies that cancer has a continual and ever-growing harmful effect not only in terms of the health status of the population but also on even larger psychological, relational and socio-economic societal aspects.  Cancer is a complex, multi-factorial disease that has a profound impact on the nutritional status and psychological/relational dimensions of patients and their caregivers.",8846a310-91f8-4f70-bd2f-310cb34808b9
4,abstract4," In this framework, considerable literature supports the concept that lifestyle and, notably, diet play an important role in determining both the potential risk of developing cancer in healthy individuals and the clinical outcome of the disease in cancer patients [5,6,7]. In this context, the World Cancer Research Fund (World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)), jointly with the American Institute for Cancer Research (American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR)), recently published the Third Expert Report on “Diet, Nutrition, Physical Activity and Cancer: a Global Perspective”, which provides an extensive and updated review of current evidence relating diet, nutrition and physical activity to cancer, as well as an expert review of potential mechanisms underlying the causal link between exposure and risk of developing cancer [8]. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, Solans et al.",a661be1b-99cd-4a2a-93c6-b97a669a62e1
5,abstract5," evaluated the 2007 World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)/American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) score in relation to cancer-related health outcomes, concluding that adherence to the 2007 World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)/American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) recommendations results in a reduced risk of cancer incidence and mortality [9].  The nutritional status of cancer patients is profoundly altered by either the disease itself or the adjuvant/advanced chemotherapy regimens. Both the nature and extent of this alteration are strictly dependent on the tumor type and localization and its stage, along with a large variety of factors related to individual conditions, both clinical and psychological. Modifications of the nutritional status of cancer patients often include sarcopenia, malnutrition and cachexia, whose definition, underlying mechanisms and differential diagnosis were the focus of a recently published review [10].",de5463eb-1487-44f0-b22f-acd446cda15a
6,abstract6," On the other hand, anticancer therapies, such as anti-metabolites and platinum-based drugs, are responsible for both nutritional deficiencies and inappropriate dietary intakes in a considerable proportion of cancer patients [11]. In addition, chemotherapy frequently induces an array of side effects, including inappetence, modifications of taste and smell, mouth inflammation and dryness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and asthenia, that may significantly contribute to producing a poor nutritional intake in cancer patients [12,13,14].  From another standpoint, cancer heavily impacts psycho-social and relational aspects of individual patients, while anxiety and depression may in turn negatively affect both their nutritional status and quality of life.",5d2da894-d68a-4799-abb8-e8c4b1d57583
7,abstract7," In particular, cancer produces drastic changes in most aspects of patients’ life, including familial, work, social and financial environments, with a differential prevalence of problems and emotional status across the diagnosis, chronic and terminal stages of the disease [15]. Furthermore, cancer patients are often confronted with a large assortment of needs that may be disparate and depend on the individual condition, history, personality and perception of the disease. According to the Italian Association of Medical Oncology, nearly 20% of cancer patients suffer from depression, 10% from anxiety and up to 50–60% are burdened by psychological distress [16]. Furthermore, cancer patients commonly experience psychosocial problems, including post-traumatic stress, fatigue, sexual dysfunction and cognitive impairment [17].

This suggests that psychosocial interventions (PSI) on patients with cancer should be individually tailored and integrated into a comprehensive approach that includes, along with conventional anti-cancer therapies, nutritional, psychological and emotional support, appropriate medical information, and communication for both patients and caregivers. In fact, in a holistic approach, every patient should be considered as a whole with their familial, social and work environment, with the aim of shaping interventions directed at promoting wellbeing, improving quality of life, relieving symptoms of disease and restricting side-effects of conventional treatments in individual patients.",7958373e-4a6d-437e-995b-f5813bc213b7

Immediately after, the patients were met again by a nutritionist to receive and be instructed on a personalized nutritional prescription. The latter was commonly divided into 5 meals (breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner), with each comprising an assortment of options and specific indications based on both individual health status and nutritional principles of the Mediterranean diet.

The greater part (n = 101, 84.2%) of patients were female, while a minority (n = 19, 15.8%) of male subjects entered the study. The large preponderance of female subjects was mostly the consequence of the historically high number of breast cancer cases attending the Azienda di Rilievo Nazionale e di Alta Specializzazione (ARNAS)-Civico and of the large Breast Unit working in the context of the Oncology Department.",39c02b7a-ae04-43e2-a5b7-c01405cac14a

As indicated in the Patients and Methods section, the eating habits of the study subjects were assessed using the INRAN questionnaire, whereby the frequency of consumption of 15 selected food groups was divided into never, yearly, monthly, weekly and daily categories. In particular, the following groups were classified: cereals and derivatives, cereal-based products, fresh meat, processed meat, fish or fishery products, milk and/or yogurt, fresh fruit, dried fruit, vegetables or greens, legumes, eggs, sweets, carbonated water/sweetened drinks and alcoholic beverages.",bfd50650-efc5-495a-8676-31526cb5304f

Out of the 120 patients studied, n = 75 (62.5%) fell in the medium–high adherence category, whilst n = 45 (37.5%) showed a medium–low adherence to the Mediterranean diet. There was no significant association between the MEDI-LITE score and other individual characteristics, including age, degree of education and occupation, except for a slight prevalence of medium–high adherence score in employees as compared with housewives (data not shown).

22,abstract22," Furthermore, the statistical analysis of the potential association between psychometric indices and patients’ characteristics is reported in Table 4.  In particular, the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT) test was used to assess body image disorders in the study subjects, with the latter being subdivided into two categories, minor and noteworthy, depending on the gravity of the condition. Overall, a significant proportion (37.5%) of patients presented a pathological perception of body image, with a greater prevalence in female (40.6%) than in male (21.1%) subjects (see Table 3). As expected, an increasingly high percentage of body image disorders was observed in patients with respect to BMI, rising from normal weight (34.9%) to overweight (40.5%) and obese (46.7%) subjects. A slightly higher prevalence of body image disorders was revealed in patients living in urban areas (40.9%) relative to those residents in villages in the countryside (28.",24e6917c-9ef9-4c47-a844-f6acdea5449d

Predictably, an alteration in body image perception was largely prevalent (28/60, 46.7%) in patients with breast cancer as compared with other tumor types (17/60, 28.3%).  The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) test, which is based on a self-assessment scale, was found to provide a reliable instrument for identifying and measuring depression and anxiety states in a hospital outpatient setting. In particular, based on the presence and severity of the emotional disorder, each subject was classified as normal, borderline or abnormal. In our study, a considerable proportion of patients presented an abnormal anxiety level (29.2%) and, though to a lesser extent, a depressive (20.0%) state (see Table 3).  Interestingly enough, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety state was significantly associated with age (p = 0.",3187531b-db6d-4269-bf34-5d6cd63978e3

No significant difference was revealed when comparing different BMI and tumor types, except for a trend toward an increasingly high abnormal anxiety state from underweight (20.0%) to overweight (32.4%) patients.  As far as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) depression scale was concerned, a highly significant greater percentage of abnormal depression was observed in male (36.8%) relative to female (16.8%) subjects (p < 0.001).

27,abstract27," Discussion  Epidemiological studies clearly indicate that the epidemics of NCDs that Western countries have witnessed in the last few decades represent the result of the dramatic changes that have occurred in both food systems and consumer eating habits and behavior globally [26,27,28]. This critical issue is also related to the actual sustainability of both the consumption and production of healthy food [29]. In particular, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) program has highlighted the strong association between lifestyle, food environment and nutritional behavior with cancer incidence [30]. In addition, nutrition plays a key role not only in cancer prevention but also in disease progression and recurrence, as well as in treatment tolerance.  Notwithstanding, as emphasized by Rauh et al.",5482d174-7618-4596-92d7-1aa36055e4f9
28,abstract28," [31], nutritional issues are very often neglected and/or poorly structured in the clinical care of cancer patients. In this context, the authors underlined the concept that nutritional assessment and management should become an integrative part of clinical trials in oncology, involving the use of nutrition specialists in an interdisciplinary approach and eventually leading to interventions that are diversified according to individual needs.  In the present study, the proposed multi-professional approach was modeled with the aim to obtain an initial recognition of the nutritional status and behavior of individual patients and to tailor the nutritional prescription to the specific necessities of the study subjects and their environment.",b0ad08f4-d562-4e4d-b219-a2d1c7b23e3b
29,abstract29," Furthermore, both the adherence to the prescription, as assessed through a simple scoring system, and its efficacy, also determined through the measurement of anthropometric indices, were revaluated monthly using a nutritional follow-up (for details see the Patients and Methods section). This allowed not only to verify whether the nutritional prescription was being correctly complied with by the patients but also to introduce changes that may eventually become desirable.  Nutritional issues represent an important aspect of clinical oncology, with a considerable proportion of cancer patients having nutritional impairment [32]. The latter is a complex condition, ranging from overweight/obesity to an increasingly high percentage of weight loss and sarcopenia and/or cachexia during the clinical course of the disease. In our study, a relatively large proportion of both female and male patients were obese (25%) or overweight (32%) at presentation.",6b2aca79-c7c9-4673-a576-ba9af7eeb514
30,abstract30," This evidence was corroborated by the finding that a considerable percentage of patients (nearly 38%) revealed a medium–low adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as assessed through the MEDI-LITE scoring system.  Doubtlessly, nutrition has a profound impact on quality of life (QoL) from both physical and psychological standpoints. From a holistic perspective, clinical care of cancer patients should integrate appropriate scrutiny and customized interventions regarding individual nutritional, psychosocial and relational issues. In an important position paper, the European Society for Medical Oncology (European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)) recently introduced the term “patient-centered care” to identify an integrated approach of both supportive and palliative care implemented along the disease course, whereby a multidisciplinary approach is systematically exploited to meet the composite and variable patients’ needs [33].",7f841812-82c8-47ad-a877-4f9ee78b11c2
31,abstract31," In this context, our multi-professional model allows an interoperable and continuous flow of information between an oncologist, nutritionist and psychologist through which clinical data is used to adapt nutritional assessment and counseling, individual nutritional issues are incorporated to shape psychological appraisal of individual patients, and both nutritional and psychological profiles are combined in intervention groups and interpolated with clinical data to determine their ultimate impact not only, broadly, on QoL but also the outcome of the disease. In the present study, data obtained at baseline supported the concept that cancer patients are deeply affected by a variety of psychosocial problems, including disorders of body image (37.5%), anxiety (29.2%) and, though to a lesser extent, depression (20.0%), with a further significant proportion being classified as borderline for anxiety (44.2%) and depression (38.3%).",e5e98f6c-9d81-49a1-8e1c-a3b72f64d693
32,abstract32," Furthermore, we observed that the psychological disturbances we considered, namely, body image disorders, anxiety and depression, were related to intrinsic patient characteristics, including gender, BMI, place of residence and education level. This implied that the combination of clinical, nutritional and psychological interventions on cancer patients should also include the evaluation of the above individual and environmental features to ultimately lead to a personalized, integrated approach to cancer care.  Nevertheless, quite frequently, if not regularly, all psychological and psychosocial disturbances are neither considered nor assisted in the clinical practice. Recently, in a population survey, Lewandoska et al. [15] reported that a relatively high proportion (46%) of cancer patients revealed a variable degree of despair, depression and feelings of helplessness, and that 93% of patients felt being in need of help regarding various aspects.",062d5144-373a-441f-b78f-598c6f0724c8
33,abstract33,"  Furthermore, there is convincing evidence that the levels of anxiety and depression of cancer patients are strictly interconnected with their nutritional status, depicting a sort of vicious cycle by which psychological distress may result in disturbances of nutritional behavior and vice versa [34]. In our study, the integration of nutritional scrutiny, intervention and follow-up, combined with tackling the psychosocial needs of cancer patients, is expected to create a positive, patient-centered environment whereby individual patients would become proactive protagonists of their disease, ultimately leading to improved quality of life and to ease the complex interactions between healthcare providers, patients and caregivers.  Another issue that has become extremely relevant during the last two decades is the overload of the information environment on cancer and nutrition [35].",d0a221c9-ff24-48b5-bef7-aa5dbd75d6b8
