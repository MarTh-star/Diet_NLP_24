0,background0," Gut microbiome dysbiosis is associated with many adverse health outcomes including multiple sclerosis, cancer, diabetes (types 1 and 2), asthma, allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and autism [1–6]. Composition of the gut microbiome is influenced by several factors including maternal delivery method, ethnicity, geography, and lifestyle [7]. Of the multiple factors associated with the term “lifestyle,” diet in particular has a major influence on the microbial composition within the gut. Bacterial abundance is modulated by dietary macronutrient consumption, including proteins, carbohydrates, and fats [6, 8, 9]. Poor diet and obesity often are linked, making it difficult to determine which variable is the major driver of the gut microbiome composition.  The composition of the human gut microbiome is dominated by the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes bacterial phyla [10]. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, enterotypes are distinguished by abundance of Bacteroides or Prevotella.",a5b77752-3964-4844-adcf-cba2750c7d9a
1,background1," While both Prevotella and Bacteroides are saccharolytic bacteria, these genera of bacteria tend to inhibit each other, thereby giving way to two separate enterotypes [11]. The prevalence of either strongly associates with long-term diets; Bacteroides predominate with protein and animal fat consumption and Prevotella are observed with carbohydrate (fiber) consumption [12]. Enteric Prevotella are more common in non-Westernized populations consuming a plant-rich diet or in Western populations with high adherence to a Mediterranean or vegetarian diet [13]. Food and nutrient consumption patterns, such as omnivore versus plant-based diet, are associated with shifts in the human gut microbiome. Subjects consuming an omnivore diet displayed increased Ruminococcus and Streptococcus abundance, while subjects on a vegetable-based diet showed increased abundance of Roseburia, Lachnospira, and Prevotella [14].",e3be84c4-d764-46c0-bfcc-eff7810c85a5
2,background2," High-fat diet and obesity are linked to modulation of these phyla in humans and mice; both factors are associated with increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes phyla in the gut metagenome [6, 8, 9, 15–17].  The microbiome of non-human primates (non human primates (NHP)) harbors Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, similar to the human microbiome [18, 19]. Prominent differences (see [19]) exist between the macaques and human microbiome such as elevated Helicobacter and Spirochaetes in non human primates (NHP)s compared to humans, albeit these non human primates (NHP)s were consuming standard adult monkey chow that would not compare to humanized dietary patterns and may account for some of the noted differences [19]. A study investigating the differences in the gut microbiome between captive and wild non human primates (NHP)s (8 different species) indicate that captivity “humanizes” the primate microbiome [20].",289182dc-18ff-44b1-9352-c2b292935a33
3,background3," Taken together, these data suggest that application of a humanized dietary pattern in captive non human primates (NHP)s may accurately represent the human microbiome. As an additional benefit, the establishment of a non human primates (NHP) model allows for a closely controlled study without adherence or self-reporting issues, and avoiding medication, all of which often are confounding factors in human studies.  This study examines the impact of a translationally relevant humanized Western and Mediterranean dietary patterns on the gut microbiota, and association with obesity, in female middle-aged cynomolgous macaques. Application of these diets has been shown to significantly influence the gut populations of cynomolgous macaques [18]. Mediterranean diet consumption increased the genera Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, and Oscillospira while decreasing Ruminococcus and Coprococcus representation [18]. However, the aforementioned report relied on 16S rRNA sequencing.",6b5c9810-2406-4276-922a-06891a27a019
4,background4," In the study reported here, we instead utilize metagenomic sequencing, the methodology used in Human Microbiome Project [21]. 16S sequencing is useful in studies where many samples are available, but has poor resolution compared to metagenomics [22]. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing offers enhanced functional and taxonomic resolution to allow identification of specific bacterial species and strains [21–23]. This has allowed us to report bacterial species as well as virulence factor clusters modulated by dietary exposure in cynomolgous macaques, improving understanding of the similarities and differences between non human primates (NHP)s and humans with the respect to influence of diet on the gut microbiome. In addition, we assessed complete metabolic profiling data for each of the animals to correlate gut microbiota populations with body weight (BW), body adiposity, plasma cholesterol levels, insulin tolerance testing, and metabolite signatures in plasma or urine.",20d134ba-969c-4a3f-bdff-2cb7e1576e10

In humans, consumption of high fat animal-based Westernized diet leads to decreased Bacteroidetes: Firmicutes ratio, mainly due to enrichment of Firmicutes.",eb02b203-87d1-4648-8e95-c3bc17c643f2
35,discussion1," We confirmed previous results from 16S sequencing data demonstrating that Western diet-fed non human primates (NHP)s displayed increased proportional abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum with no significant shifts in Firmicutes populations [18]. Consumption of a Western-like diet in the African green monkey led to a similar outcome, although important to note that this study relied on 16S sequencing and was unable to identify species level classifications [35]. The elevated Bacteroidetes abundance observed in the non human primates (NHP)s is driven by an enrichment in P. copri. Gut P. copri displays an interesting case of duality in human health and disease. Non-westernized lifestyle is associated with increased gut P. copri abundance [36]. Literature strongly supports the association of gut P. copri abundance with improved glucose and insulin tolerance when diets are also fiber rich [37, 38].",8d4e37c3-e517-4f28-80c1-8a5afd8c3f19
36,discussion2," On the other hand, in studies from Westernized populations Prevotella dominated enterotypes (in particular P. copri) have been linked with autoimmune disease, new onset rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and diabetes [39–42]. Taken together, these data suggest that any potential health benefits from P. copri could be dependent on host diet background.  While overall Bacteroides abundance is low in non human primates (NHP) subjects, possibly due to the mutually exclusive dominance of Prevotella, monkey subjects consuming a Westernized diet did display elevated B. uniformis and B. vulgatus species when compared with Mediterranean diet-fed animals. In this regard, monkeys responded to translationally relevant diets in a similar pattern to humans (consumption of animal product diet increased Bacteroides in human subjects [12];).",81758e10-0549-420c-a845-d25aff718f73
37,discussion3," The duodenum, ileum, and colon of non human primates (NHP)s (while consuming standard monkey lab chow) are more acidic than what is observed in humans [43], which could lead to some differences in microbiota populations. Bacteroides have weak acidic tolerance (pH preference 6.5-6.9 [44, 45];) while Prevotella display slight acidic preference (pH 5.5-6.0 [46];), which could potentially explain the dominance of Prevotella in the gut of non human primates (NHP)s (human versus non human primates (NHP) colon pH: 6.4-7.0 (proximal to distal colon pH range) in humans compared to non human primates (NHP) colon pH 5.1 [41].)  We showed two distinct enterotypes in Western diet-consuming animals based upon P. copri abundance. The P. copriLOW subgroup displayed increased bacterial diversity and elevated E. siraeum (strain: V10Sc8a). Gut E. siraeum abundance in non human primates (NHP) from either diet correlated with elevated HDL-C levels, suggesting a more metabolic healthy subgroup.",269f160b-5850-4d50-b2e7-6f28e608c897
38,discussion4," Devillard et al. demonstrated novel biosynthetic activity of E. siraeum mediating the bioconversion of linoleic acid to form conjugated linoleic acids (CLA; mainly cis-9,trans-11-18:2 [47];). Consumption of CLA is associated with various health benefits (including elevating HDL-C [48]), further supporting the association between E. siraeum and HDL-C observed in our study. In a small monozygotic Korean twin study (n=20), E. siraeum negatively correlated with obesity [49], giving evidence in support of the E. siraeum-enriched P. copriLOW subgroup displaying a healthier enterotype.  Our metabolic data in urine and plasma samples obtained from Western diet-fed P. copriHIGH and P. copriLOW subjects indicates potential early stage kidney damage in P. copriHIGH animals. Hypertensive adolescents display elevated urinary excretion of carnitine metabolites [50] which also serve as a marker for proximal tubular damage [51].",0c236917-8c62-47a9-af71-3cbc50ad9484
39,discussion5," Therefore, the observed elevated urinary carnitine, acteylcarnitine, and acyl-carnitine metabolites (but not plasma levels) may represent an attenuated capacity for reabsorption and possibly are an early mark of renal tubular damage. The uremic toxin, symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), inhibits nitric oxide production and is associated with coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and stroke [52]. Hence, the elevated urinary symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) observed in P. copriHIGH animals further associates this enterotype with kidney dysfunction and may contribute to proximal tubule damage by reducing local levels of nitric oxide. Additionally, we observed elevated plasma allantoic acid concentrations in Western diet-fed P. copriHIGH subjects. Elevated plasma allantoic acid was evident in a pre-clinical mouse model of cystic kidney disease [53].",94a5e113-ecd8-4a6b-b0ef-72603b619b0a
40,discussion6," Moreover, plasma allantoin levels were increased in both a pre-clinical rat model of kidney fibrosis [54] and in chronic kidney disease patients [55], highlighting the potential relevance of this metabolite in the assessment and/or contribution to reduced renal function (lower glomerular filtration rate). In generally healthy individuals, urine 3′sialyllactose levels correlate with chronic low-grade inflammation as measured by elevated C-reactive protein concentrations [56]. Elevated serum 3′sialyllactose served as a biomarker for mastitis development in clinically healthy dairy cows [57], giving evidence in support of 3′sialyllactose serving as a pro-inflammatory marker. The close link between chronic low-grade inflammation and the development of many metabolic diseases suggests that the elevated 3′sialyllactose observed in the urine of P. copriHIGH may indicate a sub-clinical pro-inflammatory phenotype mediated by this gut microbiota enterotype.",40484952-911c-4d94-9827-e52fde5af44f
41,discussion7," Elevated plasma carboxy 4 methyl 5 propyl 2 furanpropanoate (CMPF) is observed in gestational diabetes and in type 2 diabetes patients [58]. In mice, carboxy 4 methyl 5 propyl 2 furanpropanoate (CMPF) treatment (at diabetic levels) resulted in β cell dysfunction through oxidative stress demonstrating a dose-dependent causality of this metabolite to induce diabetes. However, it is important to note that fish oil administration also raises plasma carboxy 4 methyl 5 propyl 2 furanpropanoate (CMPF) levels but not to the extent observed in diabetic patients [59], suggesting key dose-dependent activity of circulating carboxy 4 methyl 5 propyl 2 furanpropanoate (CMPF). Taken together, the identified plasma and urinary metabolomics profile support a metabolic unhealthy potential of Western diet-fed P. copriHIGH enterotype when compared with Western diet-fed P. copriLOW animals.",34db326f-8bd7-4fb1-9643-dcb2012d5551
42,discussion8,"  In our study, obesity (as a single variable) did not appear to be significantly associated with gut microbiome composition (Supplemental Figure S5). However, body adiposity within each diet pattern was associated with subtle shifts in the proportional abundance of several key microbiota species. Among Mediterranean diet-consuming subjects, leaner animals displayed a higher proportional abundance of L. animalis compared to monkeys with more adipose tissue. Several Lactobacillus species, including L. animalis, are considered healthy probiotic commensal organisms. Administration of Lactobacillus for 6 weeks as a probiotic supplement was shown to reduce systolic blood pressure in a controlled, randomized, double-blind trial of smokers [60]. Several preclinical studies indicate positive health benefits of Lactobacillus supplementation in regards to cholesterol lowering potential [61–64].  Among Western diet-fed animals, lower adiposity subjects displayed increased B.",848a6960-dda1-4284-82fe-ee853ebb950b
43,discussion9," uniformis abundance compared to their higher adiposity counterparts. Supplementation of B. uniformis in obese mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorated metabolic dysfunction and reduced inflammation, indicating the elevated B. uniformis observed in lean Western diet-fed monkeys may be associated with a healthier phenotype [65, 66]. Heavier Western diet-fed non human primates (NHP)s had elevated Ruminococcus champaneliensis compared to their lean counterparts. R. champanelienses is a cellulose degrading bacterium that may supplement host metabolism by releasing digestible substrate from normally indigestible carbohydrates, potentially contributing to obesity. Within non human primates (NHP) on either diet, R. champaneliensis correlated with circulating cortisol and body fat composition, suggesting that while this species is associated with body adiposity, higher R. champaneliensis abundance may also modulate stress hormones in a gut-brain signaling axis.  Literature indicates that E.",d1a46420-61b6-4669-956a-79a3a6be1351
44,discussion10," rectale, F. prausnitzii, Roseburia spp., Dorea and Coprococcus metabolism produce SCFA from plant-vegetables products within the gastro-intestinal system for potential health benefits [67, 68]. We identified other Eubacterium species (E. eligens, E. hallii, and Eubacterium sp. 3_1_31), F. prausnitzii, Roseburia hominis, multiple Dorea sp. (D. formicigenerans, D. longicatena, and Dorea sp. AGR2135), and several Coprococcus species (C. catus and C. comes) to be significantly higher in Mediterranean diet-fed non human primates (NHP) subjects than Western diet consuming animals. Our previous work demonstrated an increase in plasma bacterial modified bioactive compounds in Mediterranean diet-fed non human primates (NHP)s [24]. Consumption of Mediterranean diet elevated p-cresol-glucuronide, 3-indoxyl sulfate, and indole-3-propionate (indole 3 propionate (IPA)).",096bf550-ae01-4642-97b1-568bc79641eb
45,discussion11," indole 3 propionate (IPA) is the deamination product of tryptophan mediated by gut Clostridium and Lactobacillus species, which we observed elevated Lactobacillus sp. (L. animalis, L. johnsonii, L. murinus, and L. reuteri) and Clostridium sp. SS2/1 in our Mediterranean diet-fed monkeys. Metabolomic analysis of conventional-housed and germ-free mice have indicated that germ-free mice cannot produce plasma 3-indoxyl sulfate and indole 3 propionate (IPA), demonstrating the reliance on bacteria to produce these metabolites [69]. Furthermore, administration of indole 3 propionate (IPA) improves intestinal barrier function and decrease circulating LPS thereby reducing systemic inflammation [70]. The reduction in inflammation often observed by Mediterranean diet consumption [71–75] may result from modulation of key gut microbiota populations and the production of beneficial bacterial-derived bioactive compounds.  It is important to note several key limitations of our current study.",839765fe-fa5a-4a21-89f2-ff1d9097e914
46,discussion12," This study only includes female non human primates (NHP); sex differences may exist impacting dietary influences on the gut microbiome and metabolic outcomes in males. Baseline fecal samples were not collected during the metabolic characterization phase while the non human primates (NHP) were on standard monkey chow. Therefore, the data we show in this study does not accurately reflect a response to diet, but reports metabolic and microbiome patterns associated with dietary pattern consumption.  Conclusions  In conclusion, our study demonstrated several similarities and key differences in the gut microbiome mediated by human translationally relevant diet administration. However, the key difference (stimulation of P. copri by Western diet administration) may represent a potential model to elucidate signaling differences observed in human Westernized populations with gut P. copri associations with several disease states.",bc42b42a-3def-4158-aa3c-85c9c890d5c8
47,discussion13," Furthermore, our metabolomic data indicates potential deleterious metabolite regulation in the urine and plasma of P. copriHIGH Western diet-fed subjects, suggesting that the P. copriHIGH enterotype in subjects eating a Westernized diet may potentiate the development of metabolic disease.
