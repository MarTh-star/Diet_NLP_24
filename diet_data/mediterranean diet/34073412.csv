0,background0," The decreasing adherence in Mediterranean Diet (M.D.) during the last decades has been attributed to social, cultural and economic factors. However, recent efforts to improve dietary habits and the economic improvement might be reversing this trend. We analyze the changes in M.D. adherence between 2013 and 2019 among a sample of European mature adults and the elderly. ",43e847ca-b62a-4ee7-9ba2-fe8c06819cce
1,methods0," Study design and population  We performed a secondary analysis of the last two released versions of the SHARE project (‘Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe’: wave 5 from 2013 and wave 8 from 2019/20). This survey is a cross-country research project collecting data from the European population aged over 50 years on health-, social- and economic-related topics. SHARE has data from the years 2004–20 featured in eight waves and allows the analysis of the same participants at different points in time. We therefore design this work as a longitudinal cohort study. This publication is based on preliminary SHARE wave 8 release 0 data. Therefore, the analyses, conclusions and results are preliminary.  We did not include data from waves 6 (2015) to 7 (2017) due to the few responses to the diet-related module in those waves. Indeed, this diet-related module was not performed in most countries in waves 6 and 7.",5188b7e1-45f2-437d-ac1d-36bdc38f9b24
2,methods1,"  Our sample included responders from the following 13 European countries: Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, France, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium, Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Estonia. Thirteen European countries were left out of the analysis because the wave 8 data collection was interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.  To get a sample with the same participants in the two waves, we excluded individuals who did not participate in both wave 5 and wave 8 (n = 57 329), new respondents (those who were enrolled after wave 5, n = 8265) or people who deceased (n = 5266) between the two waves. The participants in our final sample present similar sociodemographic characteristics compared with the original data set (i.e. low educated 28.99% vs. 29.26%; poor economic status 27.76% vs. 29.34%; age group 50–60 18.24% vs. 22.82%; retired 66.34% vs. 63.19%).  Outcome variable  M.D.",1935e7ff-f2d7-40b6-8d65-e8be6697226d
3,methods2," data were assessed through the following survey questions [Possible responses: (i) Less than once a week; (ii) Once a week; (iii) Twice a week; (iv) three to six times a week; (v) Every day]. In a regular week, how often do you:  have a serving of legumes, beans or eggs?  eat meat, fish or poultry?  consume a serving of fruits or vegetables?  consume a serving of dairy products, such as a glass of milk, cheese in a sandwich, a cup of yoghurt or a can of high-protein supplement?  A binary index for M.D. adherence was constructed (value = 1 if following the diet; 0 not following) based on the daily consumption of fruits or vegetables (every day); and frequent intake of legumes, beans or eggs or meat, fish or poultry (three to six times a week).  Since the M.D. is based on eating habits from different locations in Spain, Italy and Greece in the 1960s, there is still some debate on the food groups included and frequency of consumption.",ae38e4cd-2f0a-46cb-b65a-ffed7221db67
4,methods3,"9 Nevertheless, we based our index on the general consensus that indicates an M.D. consisting of a high intake of fruits, vegetables, wholegrain cereals, beans and nuts, a moderate intake of fish, poultry and eggs and low consumption of red meat.7,22  Our database does not differentiate red meat from other types of meat. Therefore, we tested if results were robust to marginal changes in meat consumption in our M.D. adherence index. We tested two indexes for M.D. adherence, based on lower weekly consumption of meat, fish or poultry (M.D1—Twice a week, M.D2—Once a week).  A similar index was used in a recent study using identical SHARE data, which showed a negative correlation of M.D. with the incidence of chronic illnesses and levels of depressive symptoms.23 Thus, the findings suggest that this M.D. index has predictive power for health outcomes that points in the same direction as other more detailed M.D. studies.",9353b68f-368a-45e5-9b01-500ce833b845
5,methods4,"  Individual food groups were also analyzed: we dichotomized the consumption of fruit and vegetables (1 = every day; 2 = ≤6 times/week); consumption of meat, fish or chicken (1 = every day; 2 = ≤6 times/week); consumption of legumes or eggs (1 = >3 times/week; 2 = ≤2 times/week); and consumption of dairy products (1 = every day; 2 = ≤6 times/week).  Explanatory variables and covariates  The year of the interview (wave 5 = 2013 and wave 8 = 2019/20) was coded as a dichotomous variable. Covariates included gender (female/male), age as continuous variable (50–103 years old), country (14 countries’ fixed effects), educational level [primary education (9 years of education)/secondary education (12 years of education)/tertiary education (>12 years of education)], economic deprivation [household able to meet ends meet (with difficulty = poor/fairly easily = fair/easily = good)],",3f9a7f38-d1a6-48d2-b47d-8e39dafcdc1c
6,methods5, employment (retired/employed or self-employed/permanently sick or disabled/homemaker/unemployed) and self-perceived health (good/fair/poor). ,a13be43b-c39b-4d08-84f3-29ff93986e8c
7,analysis0," Logistic regressions were used to model the consumption of M.D. adherence, meat/fish, fruit/vegetables, legumes/eggs and dairy products as function of the year. We performed stratified analyses by educational level and age groups and for transitions in economic status, employed and self-perceived health between 2013 and 2019/20. This analysis enables us to explore the possible differences in M.D. adherence according to transitions in economic status, employment or health. All regression models were controlled for gender, educational level, economic deprivation, employment, self-perceived health and country.  To check if the trend in M.D. adherence was not linked to the ageing of the population during the observation period (6/7 years), we performed a robustness check by running an additional stratified analysis by age: we measured the change in M.D. adherence within different people of the same age in waves 5 and 8, e.g. we compared the M.D.",0fd39b66-da50-4032-bea7-b00a76466088

9,results2,"  People with poor economic status had a lower increase in M.D. adherence (OR = 1.288, P < 0.01) when compared with the M.D. adherence increase of the higher economic status sub-group (OR = 1.501, P < 0.01; table 2). This trend is mainly the result of the greater decrease in meat and fish consumption among people with good economic status (OR = 0.624, P < 0.05). The groups of people who experienced an improvement in their economic state from 2013 to 2019/20 increased the M.D. adherence significantly (OR = 1.294, P < 0.01; table 2). We observed a similar greater adherence for the people whose economic situation worsened (OR = 1.391, P < 0.01). Unlike the first group, the consumption of fruits and vegetables (OR = 0.756, P < 0.01), meat and fish (OR = 0.784, P < 0.01) and dairy products (OR = 0.783, P < 0.01) fell significantly.

10,results6," However, the group of people who stated being in a poorer health condition in 2019/20 had a greater significant decrease in the consumption of fruits and vegetables (OR = 0.749, P < 0.01), meat and fish (OR = 0.660 P < 0.01) and dairy products (OR = 0.772, P < 0.01).  The increase in adherence was slightly lower among people with secondary education and age groups above 70.  Results from our robustness check showed that between 2013 and 2019/20, the variation patterns in M.D. adherence was similar among most age groups (Supplementary appendix SA1).  Finally, the analysis stratified by country showed a significant increase in M.D. adherence in most European countries (Supplementary appendix SA2). ",24cf14eb-b42e-492f-b79a-d3c0ef02519a
11,discussion0," Key findings  Our results show that M.D. adherence increased among mature adults and the elderly in Europe between 2013 and 2019. The trend was observed in all socioeconomic groups except for people who retired during this period. The change was mainly related to the growth in legumes, beans and eggs uptake and to a reduction of daily animal protein intake. Still, we observed a slight decrease in the daily consumption of fruits and vegetables.  The growth in M.D. adherence was more prevalent among younger age groups, with higher income and tertiary education, and overall better self-perceived health.  Interpretation  Contrary to most evidence from the last decades,1,4,14,24 our data seem to indicate a shift to a diet pattern closer to the M.D. This increase was visible in almost all European countries, most notably in northern Europe, where this diet pattern has gradually become more common since the 1960s.",8d2fdb7e-db48-43bf-a9e8-b3cbad7de46b
12,discussion1,"1 Our results were obtained on very recent data, so that differences from findings reported in earlier studies may result from a real change in early trends.  The increase in M.D. adherence was felt more prominently among individuals in a comfortable economic situation. The difference is mainly related to the greater decrease in meat and fish consumption among the better-off. These findings suggest that the decline in these animal proteins is not connected to the food group’s affordability. Low-income people may already start from a lower point of meat and fish consumption due to the higher price. Therefore, they might be in a position where the reduction in this food group’s weekly intake is less likely to occur.  The economic status transition analysis supports this same proposition: individuals who had difficulties meeting ends meet and moved to a better financial status in 2019/20 did not decrease their meat and fish intake.",9dc7a45c-8f9b-4458-a413-c3870ab2c044
13,discussion2," Also, this subpopulation was the only one that had a small increase in vegetables and fruit consumption. In contrast, the group of people that experienced a worsening of the household economic situation had some of the sharpest reductions in vegetables, fruits, meat, fish and dairy daily intake. However, this was the group with the greatest increase in legumes and eggs consumption. Loss of purchasing power might have led to the replacement of more expensive foods (fruits/vegetables and meat/fish) with less costly ones (legumes/eggs).25–27  Interestingly, this presents a more nuanced picture of the household budget impact on M.D. adherence. It was a similar growth in these opposing subpopulations, i.e. people who experienced improvement vs. decline of household budget: while the first group consumed more vegetables and fruits in 2019/20, the second reduced meat and fish and increased legumes and beans intake.",60a2184a-30f4-4942-96a7-3d3ea96ad6f2
14,discussion3,"  Health status also seems to affect dietary patterns: people who claimed to be in good health significantly reduced meat and fish intake and increased their consumption of legumes and eggs in 2019/20, which explains why the M.D. adherence was greater in this subpopulation. Noticeably, the individuals whose health deteriorated had the highest reduction in vegetables, fruits, meat, fish and dairy daily intake. This finding is in line with the evidence that links poorer health and diet changes due to appetite loss, dysphagia and other illness symptoms,20,21,28 which may also result in disease-related malnutrition. Still, a reverse causation may also help explain this connection—for instance, when poorer diet habits ultimately lead the worsened health condition.  Our data suggest some effects of retirement on M.D. adherence. Unlike people who did not change employment status, our analysis shows no significant increase in M.D.",9ce10d94-0b89-4f03-adaa-9c71a2fb7eeb
15,discussion4," adherence for responders who retired during the 6/7 years analysis period. The withdrawal from ones’ occupation or working life appears to have a more notable effect on the reduction of fruits and vegetable consumption. Contrary to other subgroups, no increase in legumes and eggs was observed for this period. The literature on this topic has produced mixed findings: on the one hand, healthy eating may increase because people eat out less and have more time to prepare and cook food at home.29 On the other hand, working people may be forced to retire due to health complications, leading to changes in diet habits linked to the new health condition.30,31 Moreover, retirement is commonly associated with income loss,32 which may also imply changes in what people eat.  Education level seems to play a role in M.D. adherence changes. The results show a slight gradient in meat and fish consumption with a greater reduction among the more educated, which leads to a more substantial growth of M.D.",9fa39c7b-28e4-49ef-b4ad-08c06bc576e0
16,discussion5," for people with tertiary education. The available evidence overwhelmingly suggests a greater adherence to the M.D. among the higher educated,3,23,33 and our findings hint at the continuous entrenchment of this healthy diet habits gap between high- vs. low-educated people.  The lower M.D. adherence among older age groups may be linked to this cohort’s socioeconomic characteristics: most senior people in Europe are probably retired, usually less educated, more often economically vulnerable and have a poorer health condition. In this study, we found all of these factors to have a significant weight in the M.D. adherence.  Finally, environmental concerns about the impact of meat consumption could also be presented as a plausible hypothesis for the observed decrease in daily meat consumption and subsequent growth of M.D. adherence.",1b32de05-1198-4f63-b4a8-e04318a0a65c
17,discussion6," A recent systematic review regarding consumer attitudes towards environmental concerns of meat consumption found that consumers are increasingly aware of the overall impact of meat production and are willing to stop or significantly reduce meat intake.34 Although the authors emphasize that the proportion of people who changed their meat intake is still a small minority, they also point out that this trend is becoming more common, especially in some Western Europe.  Policy implications  It is not clear from our findings that the economic recovery in Europe was a driving factor of the increase in M.D. adherence. Our inconclusive results add to the existing complex and often contradictory evidence on the effects of economic downturns and recoveries on eating behaviours.14,35–38  Nevertheless, the shift to a healthier diet pattern contrasts with the evidence from the beginning of the last decade that linked the economic crisis with a decrease in M.D.",3c6c7056-b339-48a7-aed2-1c4d1c6a967b
18,discussion7," adherence among southern European countries. We can argue that the economic recovery enabled an environment in which other factors could more likely affect the overall M.D. adherence. For instance, the meat consumption reduction was least significant among the worse-off and mostly felt among people in a comfortable economic situation. Moving to healthier diet patterns may be easier if a reduced household budget does not constrain food choices. This could allow, for instance, the concerns around the long-term effects of unhealthy diets on health and the environmental impact of meat consumption to play a more significant part in dietary patterns.  Notably, our data point to a further increase in dietary habit inequalities within different economic, educational, health and age groups. It shows that our individual food choices are inherently bound to our social and economic position and the environment we currently live in.",0e067db9-caf6-416c-90d2-64081d0b3205
19,discussion8," Hence, the urgent shift to healthier diet patterns may only be achieved by also changing the population’s welfare conditions as a whole. Failure to address these social and economic disparities will only deepen diet and health inequalities.  Conclusions  Our findings suggest a generalized growth in M.D. adherence among mature adults and the elderly population in Europe. The reduction of animal protein consumption and rise of legumes intake were the main drivers for this shift to a healthier diet pattern. We could not find a clear link between the economic recovery in Europe and the observed changes. However, the better economic background may have enabled an environment in which health and environmental concerns could play a part in M.D. adherence.  Although the increase was consistent across most socioeconomic subpopulations, it was more evident among more affluent, educated and healthy responders, which may further entrench diet and health inequalities.",40add9f5-1420-4a78-bebb-17d0240a0f3f
20,discussion9,"  Strengths and limitations  The data from the Share surveys allow a longitudinal analysis with large representative samples of European populations. Thus, it was possible to explore cross-national and cross-wave comparability, considering the multidimensional characteristics (sociodemographic, health risks and well-being) of the same respondents over a period of time.  As usual, when working with larger samples, questions regarding food consumption were not based on food diaries, the evidence of which has shown to provide greater precision and validity.39 Instead, our sample’s food intake was measured by relying on the participant’s memory and could be biased by social desirability or social approval.40 Nevertheless, we can argue that having a large representative sample of 13 European countries outweighs this limitation.  Our M.D. adherence index is not based on a comprehensive, validated Mediterranean score5 and does not differentiate the food groups’ quality or quantity.",79dd1859-a112-4955-b96c-74edb0e26889
21,discussion10," For instance, we do not know the amount of added sugars in these products, if the meat or fish consumed is processed, or how much ‘daily intake’ implies in terms of calories. Nevertheless, we constructed our index based on a similar one that showed a negative correlation of M.D. with the incidence of non-communicable diseases,23 suggesting a predictive power for health outcomes as demonstrated in other validated instruments for assessing this diet.  Finally, the change in M.D. adherence is likely to be related to changes in prices, in diet-related policies (e.g. health promotion interventions or taxes on unhealthy foods), or in public awareness (e.g. the social media have increasingly reported the consequences of dietary patterns on health and climate change). Yet, our data did not allow estimate the impact of such contextual factors, which we intended to capture, imperfectly, through country-fixed effects.",8ad3878e-9c45-4293-9abe-b3ae990c8c8d
