0,methods0,"2.1. Study Population This prospective study was a secondary analysis using data of the large, randomized controlled trial PREDIMED (prevención con dieta Mediterránea, prevention with Mediterranean diet). Participants within the PREDIMED study were Spanish men and women at high risk for cardiovascular disease, recruited from multiple centers across the country between October 2003 and June 2009. After inclusion, participants were assigned to two groups receiving a MeDiet supplemented with either extra virgin olive oil or mixed nuts, and—in the case of the control group—solely receiving advice on following a low-fat diet. The PREDIMED protocol was approved by institutional review boards and all participants provided written informed consent. Further details on the design and protocol of the study have been described elsewhere [19,20].  The trial was stopped in December 2010 and included 7447 participants.",e2011d2f-429e-468c-847f-66a8821bd8ce
1,methods1," After exclusion of participants without food-frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) data, without BMI follow-up data, with implausible energy intakes (<800 or >4200 kcal/day in men <500 and >3500 kcal/day in women) [21] or without other data necessary to perform the analyses, the population available for the present analyses included 6942 participants with a median follow-up of 4.8 years (interquartile range: 2.9 to 5.8).  2.2. Dietary Exposure Assessment At baseline and yearly thereafter, a semiquantitative 137-item food-frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) was collected and reviewed by trained, registered dieticians. The used food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was repeatedly validated and found to be highly reproducible and have a reasonably good validity with regard to nutrient intake reported [22,23]. Spanish food-composition tables were used to derive energy and nutrient intake [24].",3853d710-1175-4bd8-ae83-ef34571311fc
2,methods2," Dietary intakes were considered as the cumulative average of all available data, from baseline to each follow-up measurement, to optimally represent long-term intake and reduce measurement error [25].  2.3. Outcome Assessment Anthropometric measurements were taken by trained personnel once a year. Weight was measured on a calibrated scale, without shoes and with light clothing. Height was determined using a wall-mounted stadiometer.  Participants with a BMI ≥25 and <30 kg/m2 were classified as overweight and ≥30 kg/m2 as obese. Substantial weight gain or loss was defined as a change ≥10% when compared to baseline body weight [26]. Body weight was analyzed as continuous outcomes and dichotomized using this cut-off (a change ≥10%), additional to the dichotomous variables for incidence (increasing to a BMI ≥30 kg/m2) and reversion of obesity (decreasing to a BMI <30 kg/m2).  2.4.",e3d926ec-932c-45ba-b988-3ca10e567466
3,methods3," Assessment of Other Variables At each yearly visit, sociodemographic variables and risk factors like educational level and working, marital, and smoking status were assessed using in a general questionnaire. Physical activity was assessed using the Spanish version of Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity, validated in both sexes [27,28]. Based on frequency and duration of 67 activities, a MET (Metabolic equivalents) score was assigned to each participant. The analyses considered updated the measurements of these covariates and in case of missing data, the last observations were carried forward to prevent participants being excluded from the analyses.  2.5. Statistical Analyses Participant characteristics were reported according to extreme quintiles of fatty acid intakes, as mean (SD) for continuous variables and % for categorical variables.",bc00f859-8f2d-4eac-b63b-7e2dfa52332a
4,methods4,"  Generalized estimating equations (Generalized estimating equations (GEE)) were fit to analyze the association between the cumulative average of yearly measured consumption of dietary fatty acids and body weight. For these continuous outcomes, the distribution was set to Gaussian and link function to identity. Effects of isocaloric substitution of fat types for one another, carbohydrates, and proteins were estimated as the difference between β coefficients of macronutrients exchanged per 5% of energy from these sources. Logistic Generalized estimating equations (GEE) regression models were used to determine odds ratios for incidence and reversion of obesity and ≥10% changes in body weight. The effects of replacing specific high-fat food products for other, higher-quality options were estimated using non-isocaloric substitution models, by considering the replacement of single portions of meat, fish and seafood (100 g), oils, butter and margarine (10 g), and nuts (30 g).",c044f9d1-48c4-4ff0-af0d-5e33dd1f76a9
5,methods5," For all Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, an exchangeable correlation structure was assumed.  The model included intakes of all energy delivering dietary variables except for one (the last one being omitted as they add up to 100% for any person) and was adjusted for age, sex, intervention group, baseline BMI or body weight, leisure-time physical activity (quintiles of MET-min/week), smoking status (never, former, current smoker), educational level (none/primary, secondary, academic/graduate), working status (employed, unemployed, housewife, retired), marital status (single/widowed, married), and dietary fiber intake (continuous).  Sensitivity analyses were performed using mixed-effects models instead of Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models and both observed and updated measurements of exposure instead of cumulative averages.",71ad7597-f9e8-49db-86a7-043eb3c558e5
6,methods6," Missing values of dietary variables and weight were imputed using multilevel multiple imputation in the Generalized estimating equations (GEE) model with body weight as the continuous outcome. Data were assumed to be MAR (missing at random) and m = 20 datasets were created using multivariate normal (multivariate normal (MVN)) as the imputation algorithm [29].  All statistical analyses were performed using STATA/SE V.12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  3. Results 3.1. Baseline Characteristics The population available for the analyses consisted of 6942 participants with a mean age of 67 (SD: 6) years and of which a proportion of 47% was obese at baseline. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of participants. Mean total fat intake was 30.5% of total energy intake (EN%) in the lowest quintile versus 50.6 EN% in the highest.  3.2.

7,methods7," Body Weight Differences The results of Generalized estimating equations (GEE) substitution models presented in Table 2 show the predicted effects of replacing 5% of energy from a specific fat subtype for 5 EN% of another fat subtype, proteins or carbohydrates. The results suggested consuming polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is associated with a significant weight difference when replacing saturated fatty acids (SFA) (mean change −0.51 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.81, −0.20), proteins (−0.27 kg; 95% CI: −0.49, −0.04) or carbohydrates (−0.20 kg; 95% CI: −0.37, −0.02). Additionally, isocaloric substitution of 5 EN% of saturated fatty acids (SFA) with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was inversely associated with body weight (−0.38, 95% CI: −0.69, −0.07). Increasing saturated fatty acids (SFA) at the expense of carbohydrates was found to be directly associated with body weight (0.31 kg; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.56).  3.2.2.",07ba802d-651b-42e8-bd97-145ed2d9108b
8,methods8," Obesity Incidence and Reversion, Substantial Weight Gain and Loss In a total number of 3700 initially non-obese participants, 657 incident cases of obesity were observed during follow-up. Table 3 shows the results of the logistic Generalized estimating equations (GEE) investigating the association between nutrient substitution and 2 dichotomous outcomes: Obesity incidence and substantial weight gain (≥10%).  Replacing 5 EN% of proteins with 5 EN% of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) decreased the odds of obesity incidence (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.83) and ≥10% weight gain (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.99). The odds ratio (95% CI) for obesity incidence was 1.36 (1.02, 1.81) when 5 EN% of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was replaced by monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Reversion of obesity occurred 819 times within the 3242 participants who were obese at baseline.",57ba9bbf-18dd-4ef7-8347-42e70475ce82
9,methods9," Note that in Figure 1 an odds ratio (OR) >1 indicates increased odds of reversion of obesity or weight loss (≥10%), so desirable changes.  Replacing saturated fatty acids (SFA) with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) significantly increased the odds of the reversion of obesity (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.25) and substantial weight loss (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.28). Slightly less strong but significant associations were found for the odds of substantial weight loss when polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake was increased at the expense of proteins (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.86) or carbohydrates (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.57). Increasing monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) at the expense of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) resulted in an OR of 0.78 (0.61, 1.00) for a ≥10% weight loss. As a summary, all significant results in Table 3 and Figure 1 advocate for a higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake.  3.3.",ae5d2374-0492-4538-8769-777eaeda078c
10,methods10," Substitution of Food Items The estimated effects of non-isocaloric food item substitutions on body weight are shown in Table 4. Significant weight difference estimates were observed when daily replacing a 100 g portion of red meat with white meat (−0.64 kg, 95% CI: −0.94, −0.35), oily fish (−0.75 kg, 95% CI: −1.13, −0.38) or white fish (−0.87 kg, 95% CI −1.17, −0.56).  Replacing a 10 g portion of margarine with vegetable oils other than olive oil resulted in a significant estimate, suggesting a weight gain of 0.26 kg (95% CI: 0.02, 0.50). No significant associations were observed for the replacement of butter and margarine with olive oil or replacing 30 g of mixed nuts with an equivalent portion of walnuts.  Estimates of nutrient substitutions for continuous outcomes were consistent when using mixed-effects models with random intercepts for recruitment center and identity level.",43501b13-5cf7-4c15-b7f4-0dea51d68481
11,methods11," Mixed-effects models are a little more conservative, however, thus showing wider confidence intervals (data not shown).  4. Discussion The results of this prospective study suggest that increasing the intake of unsaturated fatty acids (especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) at the expense of saturated fatty acids (SFA), proteins, and carbohydrates may have beneficial effects on body weight and obesity. Reversing obesity seems to be especially successful when replacing saturated fatty acids (SFA) with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and replacing proteins with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) lowers the risk of becoming obese in the first place. Increasing monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) at the expense of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), on the other hand, shows a significantly increased risk of becoming obese. These findings are in line with previous research [30], although there is still controversy [31].",12908fc5-efeb-4f49-9903-fe3efddbcd2b
12,methods12," Most prior research on the association between dietary fat and overweight/obesity merely considered total fat intake or the MeDiet as a whole. Evidence from 53 randomized controlled trials summarized in a systematic review and meta-analysis did not support low-fat diets over other dietary interventions for long-term weight loss, when compared with dietary interventions of similar intensity [15]. A systematic review of 5 RCTs found the MeDiet resulted in greater weight loss than low-fat diet at ≥12 months but produced results similar to other comparator diets, like a low-carbohydrate diet [14]. These results are in line with an earlier meta-analysis [13]. Although the results of the included studies were inconsistent and the meta-analyses reported significant heterogeneity, the evidence ultimately points towards a role of a high-quality, moderately high-fat diet like the MeDiet in the prevention of overweight and obesity.",fface609-46b6-4c9a-85b8-8fc1b7f99919
13,methods13," Results of the PREDIMED trial supported that the intervention did not have a differential effect on body weight compared to the control group [32].  One prospective study in a Spanish sample of the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study further focused on dietary fat subtypes and concluded that the association between consumption of specific types of dietary fat, olive oil, and obesity in Spain was not very important [33]. However, the design of the study was cross-sectional. Ten years later, the results of the EPIC–PANACEA study showed the MeDiet may prevent weight gain and the development of obesity. Unfortunately, this study did not distinguish between types of fat [34].  Previous PREDIMED studies showed a protective effect of MeDiet interventions supplemented by olive oil or nuts and of dairy consumption [35,36].",92961963-10c3-41c0-be60-be84f87116be
14,methods14," Moreover, extensive evidence was found that nut consumption does not increase body weight and obesity incidence and may even be inversely associated with these outcomes [17,37,38]. Most nuts are especially high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), whereas walnuts are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Adherence to the MeDiet in general has also been shown to be directly associated with fulfilling nutrient recommendations [39,40].  Another important finding of our study, in the context of substitution models, is that reductions in red meat consumption coupled with respective increases in white meat or fish would lead to less weight gain. This is important because it represents a translation of fat substitution models into food item replacement models and it generates a comprehensible and easily understandable message for the population.",88dec37f-5945-4033-b47c-7adeab216d36
15,methods15," This is in accordance with the concept of the MeDiet, which fosters the preference for white meat consumption over red meat and includes regular fish consumption. It is also important to focus on specific food groups or items, since different foods rich in a specific fat subtype may have different effects on body weight [41].  The satiating effect of the MeDiet may explain some beneficial effects on body weight, especially in a longer term. Furthermore, evidence shows mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids are more readily oxidized than saturated fatty acids and have a greater thermogenic effect, which can lead to reduced fat accumulation [42]. The quantity and quality of dietary fat have also been shown to induce differential lipid storage and processing gene expression, influencing adipokines release, but this process and regulation is still only partially understood [43].",c2d5847a-f2a0-4d32-91a0-73865689d7bf
16,methods16," Adherence to MeDiet may also be inversely correlated with proinflammatory biomarkers [44], and another potential important mechanism is the influence on adipose tissue metabolism and secretory functions [45].  The major strengths of the present research include its prospective design, large sample size, and repeated measurements of exposure, outcomes, and confounders over a long follow-up period. Due to comprehensive data records, most relevant confounders could be controlled for. Nevertheless, residual confounding is possible. Genetic determinants for instance may influence measures of obesity and were not available in the dataset [46]. Systematic error may be present due to the large proportion of obese individuals, known to have a tendency to underestimate their dietary intakes (in particular total energy intake) and overestimate physical activity; however, this error will probably be nondifferential [47].",6c8d4152-5848-4614-a648-8bd7a049f821
17,methods17," Furthermore, well-known measurement errors as a result of methodological issues in the memory-based assessment of dietary factors and physical activity may bias the results. The study of waist circumference as a potential outcome measure was also considered and would shine light on the matter, but the risk of substantial measurement error, especially in overweight and obese participants [48], makes it worthy of special attention and more complex analyses are warranted, so we decided not to include it in this manuscript for the sake of simplicity. Both the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and physical activity questionnaire have been validated, however [22,23,27,28]. Energy-adjusted intraclass correlation coefficients for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)s, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)s, and saturated fatty acids (SFA)s in four 3-day dietary records and the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were 0.61, 0.60, and 0.75, respectively [22].",6edd039b-a0eb-4f03-a5b1-d6c53f0a5b32
18,methods18," Analyses of trans fatty acids were considered. Intake of this fat subtype was very low in this study, however (0.47 ± 0.13 EN%); thus, these investigations may be more effective in a different population.  This study cannot fully demonstrate causality of the observed associations. Obesity and body weight may be susceptible to reverse causation in the sense that once their body changes, participants adjust their eating habits [49]. The use of a generalized estimating equation was chosen for all of the analyses. An alternative could have been multilevel mixed-effects models. Both Generalized estimating equations (GEE) and mixed-effect methods are appropriate for longitudinal data as they account for within-subject correlations occurring as a result of repeated measurements, but Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models are more flexible.",8b55de12-c8c6-48f4-b9c0-d54de2b38db9
19,methods19," For linear regression models with continuous outcomes, the random effects assumption is equivalent to an exchangeable correlation structure in Generalized estimating equations (GEE) [50]. The sensitivity analyses confirmed this as estimates were very similar, though the outcomes of the mixed-effects models were more conservative with wider confidence intervals. Models assessing the effect of actual changes in diet on changes in weight may lead to more interpretable results and better conclusions [41].  Although a lot of effort was put into collecting complete data, missing data are unavoidable in longitudinal studies. Throughout the years, this problem has been well documented and a range of solutions have been proposed [29]. In this case, multiple imputation was used only for the Generalized estimating equations (GEE) model with body weight as a continuous outcome, to verify that the results obtained by complete case analyses with covariate adjustment were indeed unbiased.",7b27d7ac-ed14-49bb-ae99-691b3d10f797
20,methods20," Multiple imputation is flexible when it comes to assumptions regarding the randomness of the missing data, which makes it suitable for sensitivity analyses in the case of MNAR scenarios. Complete case analysis was used for further analyses as the results were similar and this method is less time-consuming, more transparent, and at least as efficient as multiple imputation [29].  The population of this study consisted of older participants at high risk of cardiovascular disease and (almost all) overweight or obese at baseline, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. The number of subjects was, however, very large, and subjects came from different social levels and geographical areas and biological mechanisms will be similar in other populations. Moreover, mean total fat intake represented 40.5% of the total energy intake in this study population, which is comparable to the intake observed in a pooled analysis of studies across Spain [51].",6ba46c11-9280-407e-b3df-d5f5c51d6392
21,methods21," Mean intakes of fat subtypes were slightly more desirable than intakes measured previously in Spain: monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) 20.2 in the present study versus 15.9 EN%, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) 6.5 versus 5.6 EN% and saturated fatty acids (SFA) 10.3 versus 12.0 EN%.   Lastly, body weight was a secondary outcome in the PREDIMED trial. Neither energy restriction nor increased physical activity were advised for any treatment arm, as the intervention was not designed with the intention of causing weight loss. It should also be noted that one diet does not fit all, and weight control strategies should be based on personal goals. The MeDiet could, however, be a useful method to achieve personal goals, due to its high palatability and satiating effects and, therefore, better adherence [46]. Integrating energy restriction and increased physical activity could further enhance weight loss and health benefits [38].",831f7e64-eb50-4df4-a7b3-8880c6b0c340
22,methods22," Currently, data are being collected for the PREDIMED-Plus trial, including an intensive lifestyle intervention program with an energy-restricted MeDiet, increased physical activity, and behavioral treatment.  5. Conclusions In conclusion, this study provides evidence that increasing monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intakes at the expense of saturated fatty acids (SFA), proteins, and carbohydrate intakes may contribute to losing weight and reverse the state of obesity in an older and overweight/obese Spanish population. It could therefore be recommendable to encourage a high-quality, moderately high-fat eating pattern like the MeDiet, which means increasing the quality of dietary fat instead of restricting total fat intake in the prevention of obesity.
