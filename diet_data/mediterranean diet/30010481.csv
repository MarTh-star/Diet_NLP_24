0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design The Hospital Clínico San Carlos provides medical assistance to the core of the Community of Madrid. Pregnant women attend their first gestational visit at 8–12 gestational weeks to get an ultrasound and a prenatal screening test.   In general, all pregnant women receive nutritional guidelines from their midwives and obstetricians from the start of pregnancy. Before 2016, standard-care guidelines were based on a MedDiet pattern, but limit fat intake, including extra virgin olive oil and nuts.  Universal and centralized screening of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (at 24–28 gestational weeks) is performed at the Central Laboratory of the Hospital. The International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria have been used to diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) since 2012. Women with a positive diagnosis are referred to the Diabetes and Pregnancy Unit for treatment and follow-up.",0087a694-f477-4bb2-ae09-fdbed60a2f9e
1,methods1," Detailed information about the treatment protocol has been published elsewhere [12]. First-line therapy is medical nutrition therapy, based on a MedDiet with a liberalized consumption of extra virgin olive oil (≥40 mL/day) and nuts (a handful a day). Women who do not develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a usual routine-care follow-up.  From 2016, dietary guidelines given to all pregnant women at the beginning of pregnancy are similar to the ones given as medical nutrition therapy for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  This is a retrospective cohort study that clusters women into two groups: the standard-care group and the early-intervention group.",ec715229-c7f7-4668-bb29-67e1b31ddff6
2,methods2,"  The inclusion criteria were women with normal glucose tolerance (fasting glucose <92 mg/dL) in the first gestational visit (at 8–12 gestational weeks), ≥ 18 years old, single gestation, who attended postpartum evaluation at 12–14 weeks postpartum and who were exclusively breastfeeding at the moment of postpartum evaluation. Exclusion criteria were gestational age at entry >14 gestational weeks, intolerance/allergy to nuts or extra virgin olive oil or any medical conditions or pharmacological therapy that could interfere with the effect of the intervention or compromise the follow-up program.  The studies included in this analysis were approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Clínico San Carlos (ethic codes CI 13/296-E and CI 16/442-E) and conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration. All women signed a letter of informed consent.  2.2. Study Population The sample of women used in this cohort study was retrieved mainly from three different studies [7,13,14].",35818c83-fa8f-4594-80f5-1ff126cd4740
3,methods3,"  Standard-care group: The women in this group received general advice and leaflets regarding their diet and physical activity, usually provided by the local antenatal clinics. They received standard-care dietary guidelines by midwives based on a Mediterranean diet but limiting the consumption of fats (including extra virgin olive oil and nuts).  From 2013–2015, 1335 women were followed-up, of which 676 (50.6%) attended postpartum evaluation and were exclusively breastfeeding. These women are mainly from the observational study of Ruiz–Gracia et al. [14] and the control group of a randomized controlled trial (St. Carlos gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) Prevention Study) [7].  Early-intervention group: These women received dietary guidelines based on a Mediterranean diet, with emphasis on the consumption of a daily intake of ≥40 mL of extra virgin olive oil and a handful of nuts, provided by dietitians early on in pregnancy (<12 gestational weeks).",010acacc-bdf7-42ff-9154-ff23389528c5
4,methods4,"  From 2015–2017, 1675 women were followed-up, of which 999 (59.6%) attended postpartum evaluation and were exclusively breastfeeding. These women mainly belong to the intervention group of the St. Carlos gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) Prevention Study [7] and an intervention study based on real-world clinical practice [13]. Women from both studies received the same dietary intervention and attended the same gestational visits (at 12–14, 24–28, and 36–38 gestational weeks).  All women who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) were followed-up at the Endocrinology Unit and received the same medical nutrition therapy and treatment, irrespective to belonging to the standard-care or intervention group.  2.3. Data Collection All women were evaluated at gestational weeks 24–28 and 36–38, and at 12–14 weeks postpartum. At all visits, blood and urine samples were obtained, and anthropometric measurements and lifestyle were registered.  2.2.1.",067e2f52-a87f-4a26-9660-0fa085a7aed5
5,methods5," Clinical Data The following set of data were collected at baseline: family history of any metabolic disorders (type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome), obstetric history (miscarriages and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)), educational level, employment, number of prior pregnancies, smoking habits (registering whether they are currently smoking, or they smoked until they discovered they were pregnant) and gestational age at entry (according to the first ultrasound).  2.2.2. Outcomes Measures The primary endpoint was to evaluate the effect of a Mediterranean diet-based nutritional intervention in early gestation (from 12 gestational weeks) on the presence of MetS (and each of its components) and insulin resistance at 12–14 weeks postpartum. MetS was defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria. This is having three or more of the following: waist circumference (cm) ≥89.",1a602e5d-43df-4b34-8824-7353edc999a1
6,methods6,"5, fasting plasma glucose (mg/dL) ≥100, and HbA1c (%) ≥5.7, systolic blood pressure (mmHg) ≥130/diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) ≥85, HDL (mg/dL) <50 and triglycerides (g/L) ≥150. IR was defined as having a HOMA ≥3.5, according to cut-off values specified in the Spanish population [15,16]. Fasting glucose (FG) and HbA1c levels were used to determine the presence of prediabetes and diabetes. Prediabetes was classified according to ADA guidelines: A1C 5.7–6.4% and impaired fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L).  Other outcome measures were weight retention, waist circumference, dyslipidemia, blood pressure, and lifestyle. Weight gain was calculated according to self-referred pregestational body weight. Bodyweight change at postpartum (weight retention) was calculated as postpartum weight—pregestational body weight. Height and weight were measured using a digital height measuring scale (Seca 769, seca GmbH & Co. KG, Hamburg, Germany).",39163f95-0c7c-4d5c-9d22-0262326eb7a6
7,methods7," Waist circumference was measured only in the postpartum evaluation. It was measured with an anthropometric measuring tape, in the horizontal plane between the lowest rib and the iliac crest. This measurement was repeated twice, and the average was registered. Blood pressure, height, weight, gestational weight gain, and body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) were evaluated in pregnancy and at postpartum. The lipid panel consisted of cholesterol (total, low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)) and triglycerides. Blood pressure was measured with an electronic, digital sphygmomanometer with adequate armlet after resting 10 minutes in a sitting position (Omron 705IT, Omron Global, Kyoto, Japan).  2.2.3. Lifestyle Assessment Pregestational, gestational (at 12, 24–28, and 36–38 gestational weeks) and postpartum eating habits were registered.",24c42ce5-aead-4745-9992-5d02ec07b212
8,methods8," The Diabetes Nutrition and Complications Trial questionnaire were used to evaluate physical activity and general healthy eating habits. It is based on 15 items, three of which evaluate physical activity and the 12 remaining food frequency intakes. This was used to obtain the “Nutrition Score”. The 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener was used to evaluate adherence to the Mediterranean diet. It is based on 14 food items and was used to determine the MedDiet score. A detailed description of the evaluation method is described elsewhere [7].  2.2.4. Biochemical Analysis Blood and urine were obtained after an overnight fast of 8–10 hours. The following data were determined: HbA1c, standardized by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine; serum insulin; homeostasis assessment model for insulin resistance, calculated as glucose (mmol/L) × insulin (µUI/mL)/22.7; and fasting glucose.",7220303b-5824-4cf4-8dd9-a99f33b10935
9,methods9," low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol was calculated with the Friedewald formula. Serum levels of HDL-cholesterol were determined by enzymatic immunoinhibition method in an Olympus 5800 (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Serum level triglycerides were determined using the colorimetric enzymatic method glycerol phosphate oxidase p-aminophenazone (GPO-PAP).  An External Quality Guarantee Program of the SEQC (Sociedad Española de Química Clínica) monthly evaluates the quality of the methods.  2.4. Statistical Analysis Categorical variables are presented with their frequency and percentage distribution, and continuous variables by their mean and standard deviation (± SD). Comparisons between groups for categorical variables were evaluated using the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test. For continuous variables, measures were compared with Student’s t-test.",4c319072-0682-473b-bb57-efbcc5e7548d
10,methods10," The differences of mean values between postpartum and pregestational for MedDiet score and Nutrition score are given as 95% confidence interval (CI).  The magnitude of the association between study groups and binary outcomes (MetS and each component and IrS) were evaluated using the relative risk (RR) and 95% CI.  All p values are two-tailed at less than 0.050. Analyses were done using SPSS, version 21 (SPSS, IBM, Chicago, IL, USA).  3. Results Table 1 shows socio-demographic characteristics of 1675 analyzed women at 12–14 weeks postpartum: standard-care group 676/1335 (50.6%) and intervention group 999/1675 (59.6%). Women in the intervention group had significantly higher rates of family history of MetS, history of miscarriages, lower prepregnancy body-weight and body mass index and had significantly higher employment rates. gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) rates (%) were significantly lower in the intervention group (49.5 vs. 19.9, p = 0.001).",912ebdc4-7870-4604-988b-a045a8fe6f4b
11,methods11,"  Table 2 shows pregestational, gestational and postpartum Nutrition and MedDiet scores of women in the standard-care and intervention group. In both groups, the scores were better postpartum compared with pregestation. When comparing the intervention and standard-care group, postpartum MedDiet scores were better in the intervention group, especially in those who had gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  Table 3 compares clinical and biochemical data of all women of the standard-care and intervention group and subdivided by glucose tolerance. Levels of FG, HbA1c, triglycerides, and blood pressure were significantly lower and HDL significantly higher in the intervention group. This was similar in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), who had significantly lower levels of FG, HbA1c, blood pressure and waist circumference and significantly higher HDL.",839ca005-68d4-43d1-8fa0-635d10a2b1f8
12,methods12," The intervention group had lower pregravid bodyweight, body mass index (BMI), weight gain, and postdelivery body mass index (BMI) (all p < 0.05).  Figure 1 shows rates of MetS components and anthropometric parameters of all analyzed women and subdivided by subgroups of glucose tolerance. Regarding glucose regulation, less women (%) in the intervention group had fasting glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL and HbA1c ≥ 5.7% (p < 0.001) (Figure 1a). Rates of Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) ≥ 130 and ≥ 5 (Figure 1b), HDL-cholesterol < 50 mg/dL and triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL (Figure 1c) were also lower in the intervention group. When analyzing women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), the intervention group had these same results except for triglyceride levels.",5e3b2d69-f442-4994-a903-66d02bbde650
13,methods13," In addition, women in the intervention group had a lower body mass index (BMI) postpartum, and a higher percentage of them had weight retention <0 kgs, in both gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and non-gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women (Figure 1d).  Figure 2a shows the rate of MetS and IR of all analyzed women, comparing standard-care and intervention group. MetS was less frequent in the intervention group (11.3 vs. 19.3, p < 0.05). The RR of having MetS was of 0.74 (95% IC, 0.60–0.90) in this group of women. No significant differences were observed for neither IrS (0.88 (0.70–1.11)) nor for each component of MetS analyzed individually (data not shown). When comparing the rates of having from 0 to 6 components of MetS, the intervention group had significantly higher rates of having 0 components and lower rates of women having ≥1 components (p-trend = 0.029) (Figure 2b).",56b54801-7f57-4d86-acdb-f48ba65c4800
14,methods14,"  Figure 2c compares the rates of MetS and IrS, and components of MetS subdivided into groups of glucose tolerance. When comparing rates of MetS, these were lower in normoglycemic women of the intervention group compared to the standard-care group (7.9% vs. 12.9%, respectively, p < 0.05). Moreover, no significant differences were found when comparing rates of having from 0 to 6 components of MetS in neither gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) nor non-gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women. However, there was a tendency showing women in the intervention group to have higher rates of having 0 components of MetS and lower rates of having ≥ 1, both when analyzing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and non-gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women.  4. Discussion This study reveals that an intervention starting early in pregnancy and maintained throughout this period is associated with a 26% lower risk of having MetS at three months postpartum.",76a9568c-4f9c-420b-84df-b2ee7c995cea
15,methods15," No differences were found with regards to insulin resistance rates. Moreover, when analyzed by subgroups of glucose tolerance, normoglycemic women in the intervention group had lower rates of MetS than the standard-care group. To the best of our knowledge, no other studies have compared the presence of MetS and IrS in early postpartum between women who received a nutritional intervention and controls.  It is difficult to make comparisons of these results with other studies because in most cases, the presence of MetS is evaluated after 12 months postpartum. Only Retnakaran et al. [17] have evaluated this in early postpartum. Their rates of MetS in normoglycemic women were similar to ours but lower in those with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).",080e9f73-5d0e-496b-96f3-7077ed105360
16,methods16," Their diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was performed with the National Diabetes Data Group (National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG)) criteria in contrast to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG)) criteria used in our study. Therefore, results between the two studies are difficult to compare. In addition, a prospective cohort study evaluated the presence of MetS postpartum in women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), classified according to International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria. They also found similar rates of MetS in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women and non-gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women as ours [6].",24976e84-78da-46e3-a985-229b226c99a8
17,methods17," Moreover, the prevalence of MetS in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women as compared to non-gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women are much lower than those found by Noctor et al. [5]. However, the follow-up in their sample was of three years postpartum.  The lipid panel and blood pressure were better in the intervention group. Significant differences were observed mostly when comparing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women, where women in the intervention group had a more favourable profile. Dyslipidemia seems to be highly prevalent in both normoglycemic and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women in early postpartum (6–12 weeks) [18]. Screening for lipid abnormalities postpartum is not performed routinely, even in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women. This should be given consideration.  The intervention group had significantly lower levels of fasting glucose and HbA1c levels, even when subdividing them in groups by glucose tolerance.",056d4e75-7c58-4e3b-bfbc-e94d344f869b
18,methods18," These findings were similar to another study that found less impaired glucose tolerance in women in the intervention group as compared to the standard-care group by oral glucose tolerance test, but found no differences in fasting glucose levels [11]. Unfortunately, data is limited since no other studies have evaluated the effect of an antenatal intervention on the prevention or delay of glucose abnormalities postpartum.  Overall, there was lower weight retention in the intervention group. Similar to this, Ferrara et al. [19] showed that an intervention starting in pregnancy and maintained in the postpartum period could prevent weight retention. Other authors have found no differences between groups [11]. However, their sample was women of high-risk (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2). Thus, all women, both from the intervention and standard-care group, probably received counseling on weight loss strategies.",f2b608ea-db2a-420c-b679-e3282ed04296
19,methods19," Postpartum weight retention has been associated with a higher risk of recurrent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases [20]. Therefore, returning to pregestational body weight is important, especially in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  The intervention group maintained better scores in pregnancy and postpartum than the standard-care group, as was found in the RADIEL study. According to their findings, women in the standard-care experienced a decline in their dietary habits while the intervention group maintained better dietary quality [11]. Postpartum dietary habits reveal that of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) those in the intervention group had better dietary habits—as reflected by the scores—than the standard-care group.",fe27c660-5e02-4e6b-8102-139d759697d1
20,methods20," In the LIMIT trial, authors also found that antenatal lifestyle intervention was associated with persistence of improved postpartum dietary habits as compared to the standard-care group in overweight and obese women [21].  According to our results, all women benefit from an antenatal intervention, highlighting the importance of adopting healthy dietary habits in pregnancy. Women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) find barriers to adhere to a healthy lifestyle in the postpartum period, generally due to competing priorities such as childcare, tiredness, work duties, lack of time, and motivation [22,23]. It is mandatory to educate women on how important it is to attend the postpartum evaluation and maintain a healthy lifestyle, especially in those who have a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  This study has some limitations. One weakness is that information and selection bias cannot be ruled out.",5bfcf4ac-737d-493e-aae0-b37a27398fdc
21,methods21," The standard-care group included more women that had been diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) than the early-intervention group (49.5% versus 19.9%). This is because in the 2013–2015 period—when the standard-care group was included—a much higher proportion of women who had gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) attended a postpartum evaluation. Considering this, we tried to include women with similar characteristics in the postpartum evaluation. For instance, breastfeeding has been associated with improved insulin sensitivity postpartum in women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [24]. Therefore, only women who were breastfeeding were included in this analysis in order to make women between groups as similar as possible. Also, results show that better metabolic outcomes in women in the intervention group persist even after subdividing by groups of glucose tolerance. A second limitation is that prepregnancy body weight is self-reported.",ba950c91-e170-4654-8ca0-ac675a3bcd85
22,methods22," However, this limitation is shared by most studies. Lastly, the groups in this cohort were not parallel groups, so participants from the two groups were included at different times. However, these results reflect the changes that have happened in the usual clinical practice throughout time. Therefore, these results could be reproduced in other centers where these women are treated.  Associations between the adherence to a MedDiet rich in extra virgin olive oil and nuts in pregnancy and improved materno-fetal events have been shown in women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [7,8,9,12,13]. Results from these studies seem to indicate the benefits extend to the postpartum period.  5. Conclusions In conclusion, this study reveals that early intervention in pregnancy seems to reduce the risk of developing MetS.",0359aebb-dbee-4229-8408-fb531c5b7dcb
23,methods23," It also seemed to decrease the rates of each MetS component, prediabetes, hypertension and lipid abnormalities, irrespective to having had gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Thus, all women should be evaluated in the fourth trimester, independent of having a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Long-term implications should be studied further.
