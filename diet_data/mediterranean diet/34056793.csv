0,methods0," Study Design and Participants  Between 2012 and 2014, the MEDIDIET study was carried out in five Italian maternity wards (i.e., Turin, Florence, Rome, San Giovanni Rotondo – SGR, and Palermo) enrolling 300 healthy breastfeeding mothers. Information on study design, inclusion criteria, maternal diet assessment, human milk collection, and analysis of human milk samples has been provided in detail elsewhere (14). Briefly, mothers were 25–41 years old and gave birth to healthy term infants. In particular, inclusion criteria for mothers were  • not chronically diseased (i.e., free of diabetes, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and hypertension);  • seronegative for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency viruses;  • non-smokers during pregnancy and lactation;  • non-abusers of drugs or alcohol;  • non-severely obese (i.e., BMI < 35 kg/m2);  • not on a restricted diet.",e15653a1-7463-4458-bf1d-927a37cf8918
1,methods1,"  Inclusion criteria for infants were:  • born at ≥37 gestational weeks;  • weight range of 2,500–4,500 g;  • body length range of 46–56 cm;  • exclusively breastfed from birth to the day of human milk collection (i.e., 6 ± 1 week postpartum).  All mothers signed an informed consent form to participate in the study. The Ethics Committee of participating hospitals approved the study (protocol number: 31060 MD) as per the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.  Human Milk Collection and Analysis  On the day of human milk collection (i.e., 6 ± 1 weeks postpartum), mothers provided a sample of their foremilk (30–50 ml) expressed in the morning after breakfast and before lunch, using a breast pump. The time elapsed since the end of the previous breastfeeding session ranged from 1 to 3 h. The freshly expressed human milk was stirred and divided in sterile 10 ml tubes, overlaid with nitrogen gas to avoid oxidation, and then stored at −70°.",4e4e0890-216c-4161-9f92-9a822b02eed4
2,methods2," Human milk analyses included macronutrient composition (i.e., protein, lactose, fat, and energy density), oxidative parameters, and complete FA profile as reported in Moro et al. (14). Briefly, FAs with a chain length between 4 and 24 carbon atoms of total lipids of human milk samples were analyzed as methyl esters by capillary gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (“GC-FID”) according to the method proposed by Beermann et al. (15). In addition, the lipid content was analyzed using the method outlined by Lucas et al. (16) and Jones et al. (17). In particular, the FA analyzed included saturated FA (SFA), monounsaturated FA (MUFA), trans-FA (trans FA (TFA)), branched-chain FA (branched chain FA (BFA)), and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA).",6d760c59-d221-450f-9b35-74a33c4f35fa
3,methods3," Peak identification of saturated FA (SFA), monounsaturated FA (MUFA), trans FA (TFA), and both ω-3 and ω-6 FA methyl esters were verified and calibrated by comparison with authentic standards (NuChek Prep; Elysian, MN, United States: GLC-463, GLC-473, GLC-642, GLC-643, GLC-674, and Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., St. Louis, MO, United States: Supelco polyunsaturated FA (PUFA)3). The standard mix of branched chain FA (BFA) methyl esters was originally analyzed by Danone Nutricia Research, Utrecht, the Netherlands. Lastly, FA concentrations were recorded as% of fats.  Assessment of Maternal Diet and Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet  A validated and reproducible food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) (18–20) was administered by trained interviewers to investigate the habitual diet of mothers (from partum to the day of human milk collection).",cf8804f6-249e-46e0-95a3-58974fac762e
4,methods4," The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) included 7 sections to collect information on the weekly intake of 78 food items, recipes, and beverages as follows: (1) milk, hot beverages, and sweeteners; (2) typical Italian first courses (e.g., pasta, risotto, gnocchi, lasagne); bread, and cereals; (3) second courses (including meat, fish, and cheese); (4) side dishes (e.g., vegetables); (5) fruits; (6) sweets, desserts, and soft drinks; and (7) alcoholic beverages. The serving size was defined in “natural” units (e.g., 1 cup of milk, 1 coffee spoon of sugar, 1 egg, 1 apple) or as smaller, on average, or larger than a standard Italian serving (e.g., 80 g of pasta, 100 g of mixed salad, 175 g of potatoes, and 150 g of beef). Occasional intakes (i.e., less than once a week, but greater than once per month) were coded as 0.5 servings per week.",6ec0fc57-285b-4a58-9818-221538a2e6e0
5,methods5," Dietary data collected using the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were used to estimate maternal intake of energy and nutrients using an Italian food composition database (21). In this computation, we weighted the fat composition of each food or recipe according to information on the type of fat used for cooking or as dressing.  To evaluate the adherence of the maternal diet to the Mediterranean one, we used an a priori score (i.e., Mediterranean Diet Score – Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) developed by Trichopoulou et al. (22, 23). According to the proposed methodology, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) includes 9 dietary components: (1) vegetables; (2) fruit; (3) cereals (including bread and potatoes); (4) legumes; (5) monounsaturated FA (MUFA) to saturated FA (SFA) ratio (monounsaturated FA (MUFA)/saturated FA (SFA)) as a proxy of olive oil consumption (23); (6) fish; (7) dairy products (including milk); (8) meat (including poultry, red and processed meat); (9) and alcohol.",a252a4d3-b82a-4e97-abb5-98225368432b
6,methods6," Each of the 9 components is assigned a score of 0 or 1 using fixed or median intakes as cutoffs according to the component considered. In particular, for components more frequently consumed in the Mediterranean diet (i.e., vegetables, fruit, cereals, legumes, fish, and monounsaturated FA (MUFA)/saturated FA (SFA)), a score of 1 is given if the individual intake is greater or equal to the median, and 0 if the individual intake is lower than the median; for components less frequently consumed (i.e., dairy products and meat), a score of 1 is given if the individual intake is lower than the median, and 0 if the individual intake is greater or equal to the median. For alcohol component, a score of 1 is given for an individual consumption ranging from 5 to less than 25 g of ethanol/day, and 0 if the individual consumption is outside this range.",54765cc4-a8fe-427b-9632-cb1196f03d1d
7,methods7," The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) is obtained by adding up the 9 component scores, and therefore, it potentially ranges from 0 (no adherence) to 9 (complete adherence) points.  Statistical Analyses  The FA content was not available for 18 human milk samples due to insufficient milk volume, thus leaving 282 samples for the present analysis. We categorized the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in approximate tertiles: 0–3 points (n = 97; 34.4%) for a low adherence, 4 points (n = 74; 26.4%) for a medium adherence, and 5–8 points (n = 111; 39.4%) for a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet. None of the mothers obtained the theoretical highest score (i.e., Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) = 9) mainly due to the common Italian behavior of excluding or substantially reducing alcohol from the diet during the lactation period (24).",454d790c-a41e-45a1-be9c-b9534476423c
8,methods8," We compared the mean content of FA in human milk according to categories of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) using ANOVA adjusting for the ratio between the maternal energy intake and maternal pre-pregnancy weight (kcal/day/kg). In addition, we used the test for trend to evaluate the linear relationship of the mean contents of FA in human milk across categories of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). All analyses were conducted using R version 4.0.5. ",50572efb-565e-4b34-afe1-0fbc88d40d65

21,discussion0," We assessed the association between the adherence of breastfeeding mothers to the Mediterranean diet and the FA content of their human milk using data from the Italian MEDIDIET study. High adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower content of saturated FA (SFA) (including PA and SA), ω-6/ω-3, and LA/ALA, and higher content of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) (including OA and EA), ω-3 FA (including ALA, EPA, DHA, and DPA), and DHA/AA and (EPA + DHA)/AA) in human milk. These associations were mainly driven by the adherence to the vegetables, monounsaturated FA (MUFA)/saturated FA (SFA), fish, and dairy products components of the Mediterranean diet.  Previous studies investigated the relationship between maternal intakes of single foods or nutrients and the FA composition in human milk. A longitudinal Finnish study (25) reported a weak positive correlation (r = 0.",ce7a7c95-a80e-4433-986f-98d1554f3e0b
22,discussion1,"21) between maternal intake of high-fat dairy products and the content of saturated FA (SFA) in human milk, collected at 3 months of lactation. Likewise, we observed a lower content of saturated FA (SFA) in human milk for mothers with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet, which is characterized by a moderate to low consumption of dairy products. Accordingly, two studies (26, 27) found positive correlations between maternal intake of saturated FA (SFA) and the content of saturated FA (SFA) in human milk (r = 0.60 and r = 0.215, respectively). The lower content of saturated FA (SFA) in human milk observed among mothers with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet could not provide optimal food for the infant’s needs (2, 28–31). However, the mean content of saturated FA (SFA) in human milk among mothers who highly adhered to the Mediterranean diet (40.92 ± 5.",b7e9a949-3a34-43fe-8f53-0d79281c0735

The Italian cross-sectional study by Scopesi et al. (26) reported a positive correlation of 0.63 between maternal intake of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and the content of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) in human milk (collected during the 1st month of lactation) which is in agreement with the higher content of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) in human milk observed in this study for mothers who were adherent to the Mediterranean diet. The higher content of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) in human milk for these mothers likely derives from the consumption of olive oil, the major fat source of the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in monounsaturated FA (MUFA), especially in the form of OA (34).",e16fd6b8-d196-406a-886f-545a03cf62b6
24,discussion3,"  A cross-sectional study conducted in Denmark (35) reported a higher content of ω-3 FA (including EPA, DHA, and DPA) in human milk (collected at 4 months postpartum) for mothers who had a high intake of fish, as compared to mothers who did not consume it.

25,discussion4," We observed a higher content of ω-3 FA and the major types of ω-3 FA in human milk for mothers with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The moderate consumption of fish jointly with the high consumption of vegetables (various of them are relatively rich in ω-3 FA) results in an appreciable intake of ω-3 FA for populations belonging to the Mediterranean area (34).  Three Chinese studies assessed the association between a posteriori dietary patterns of breastfeeding mothers and the composition of human milk (6–8). Dietary patterns were derived through principal component analysis based on food group intakes of mothers. Among the dietary patterns identified in the cross-sectional study by Hu et al. (6), the “high-in-plant-foods” dietary pattern was negatively associated with total fats content in human milk, collected within 2 months postpartum.",08eb7789-b1ee-4c63-9b40-71e1b581a4c9
26,discussion5," We observed a lower content of saturated FA (SFA), a higher content of monounsaturated FA (MUFA), and a stationary content of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) in human milk for high adherence to the Mediterranean diet. In the cross-sectional study by Tian et al.

In our previous analysis of the same data, we identified five a posteriori dietary patterns based on nutrient intakes of breastfeeding mothers (5). The nutritional profile of three out of five dietary patterns, named “Proteins and FA with legs,” “FA with fins,” and “FA with leaves,” was consistent with the Mediterranean diet and therefore they showed similar associations with the FA content in human milk. In particular, the “Proteins and FA with legs” dietary pattern, characterized by high maternal intake of animal proteins (including dairy products), was weakly positively correlated (r = 0.12) with the content of saturated FA (SFA) and weakly negatively correlated (r = −0.20) with the content of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) in human milk. The “FA with fins” dietary pattern, characterized by high maternal intake of fish, was weakly positively correlated (r = 0.",57a898be-e784-4d05-8b64-47357ac235d2
28,discussion7,"23) with the content of ω-3 FA (including ALA, EPA, DHA, and DPA) in human milk. The “FA with leaves,” dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of vegetables, was weakly positively correlated (r = 0.17) with the content of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and weakly negatively correlated (r = −0.19) with the content of saturated FA (SFA) in human milk.  The FA in human milk derives from the endogenous synthesis in the mammary gland and uptake from maternal plasma. In both cases, the content of FA in human milk may be influenced by maternal nutrition (2, 38, 39). Furthermore, the role of FA in the infant diet is gaining interest because FA is involved in several growth processes, especially in visual and neural functions (28, 40). In particular, DHA is selectively enriched in a few specific membrane lipids, which include the glycerophospholipids of the retina and brain gray matter (29).",e4917cf6-94f7-4465-8a56-9f48d834c502
29,discussion8," High concentrations of DHA are present in phosphatidylserine and the ethanolamine phosphoacylglycerols of gray matter and the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptors in the retina (41). Considerable evidence showed that poor maternal DHA status increased the risk of inadequate transferring of DHA in human milk and consequently a delayed or reduced neural and visual system development of the infant (30, 42–44).  Strengths and Limitations  We observed some maternal dietary behaviors diverging from the typical Mediterranean diet such as an overall low intake of legumes, an overall quite high intake of dairy products and meat, and a low intake of vegetables for mothers from Southern Italy (Supplementary Table 1). This could be partially explained by the results of a recent internet survey describing the nutritional behavior of the Italian population and their compliance with the Mediterranean pyramid recommendations.",c9073795-4814-41ce-b943-ba3400293193
30,discussion9," The authors reported “a rather low adherence” of participants to some Mediterranean pyramid recommendations, especially by females and in the South (45). In addition, we observed that the human milk of mothers in the South had a lower content of ω-6 and ALA (Supplementary Table 2), likely due to these changing dietary habits. Nevertheless, we generally did not find other modified associations between the adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the content of FA in human milk across the strata of geographical area (Supplementary Table 2).  Some studies showed differences in the FA profile of human milk according to maternal pre-pregnancy weight and/or BMI (46, 47). However, no difference emerged in the distributions of maternal pre-pregnancy weight and BMI according to the adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), excluding possible confounding effects of these variables (Supplementary Table 3).",c1dd9c55-9f0f-4176-8609-3bbc234f3137
31,discussion10," Nevertheless, mothers highly adherent to the Mediterranean diet tended to be older than those with low or medium adherence, not excluding a possible residual confounding due to age (Supplementary Table 3). In addition, the cross-sectional design of this study did not allow to establish a causal relationship between the Mediterranean diet and the content of FA in human milk. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that differences in the contents of FA in human milk could have modified the maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet. However, it could not be ruled out that the existence of external factors (e.g., socioeconomic status or healthy lifestyles) trigger the adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the composition of human milk in parallel and causatively influence the content of FA. Dietary information of breastfeeding mothers was self-reported and possibly biased from incomplete recall.",4b28aacb-74a9-42ae-a8e6-078a89f5257e
32,discussion11," However, it was collected by trained interviewers using structured food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) which has been validated (18) and tested for the reproducibility (19, 20) in the Italian adult population, minimizing possible recall bias. Although we used a validated and reproducible food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), the maternal nutrient intakes could be underestimated. Nevertheless, we previously compared maternal nutrient intakes of mothers participating in the MEDIDIET study with those of mothers from other developed countries in a reviewing framework. The energy intake of mothers participating in the MEDIDIET study was lower than the average energy requirement (i.e., 2,300 kcal/day) recommended during the lactation period, but it was in agreement with those of the majority of studies included in the review (48).",8537042c-98f5-409d-bc72-d32f174207df
33,discussion12,"  Possible systematic and random errors in the assessment of the content of FA in human milk were reduced by a standard protocol for the collection and analysis of human milk samples. In addition, we collected all human milk samples in a short window of time (i.e., 6 ± 1 weeks postpartum) and in the morning for all mothers participating in the MEDIDIET study, avoiding the variability due to different lactation stages or different times of the day. However, we did not collect human milk samples repeatedly over time making it difficult to make conclusions on the impact of maternal diet on the composition of human milk in a comprehensive way.  Another limitation of this study is the lack of information on follow-up of the infant growth. Thus, we can establish the relationship between maternal nutrition and human milk composition and only infer the relationship between human milk properties and infant outcomes using results from external studies.",5f8dd756-9382-4f68-8eae-084d851342de
34,discussion13,"  The multicentric design of the MEDIDIET study allowed us to include mothers from different Italian regions strengthening the findings of this study. The inclusion of healthy breastfeeding mothers with healthy infants allowed transferring of these results to the general population. In addition, another strength includes the detailed set of FA in human milk provided in this analysis. Lastly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and the content of FA in human milk using a formal score of adherence.  Conclusion  High adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with human milk with lower content of saturated FA (SFA) and higher contents of monounsaturated FA (MUFA), ω-3 FA, and the major types of ω-3 FA, including DHA.",010f2147-8747-42b5-b698-28a034695864
35,discussion14," The Mediterranean diet may contribute to human milk production with higher content of specific FA which is directly involved in the growth and development of neural and visual functions of the infant, as reported by previous studies. If the results of this study were confirmed by further analyses, possibly including infant outcomes, this would help in the development of dietary guidelines for breastfeeding mothers to promote good dietary practices – such as the Mediterranean diet – and their positive implications for infants.
