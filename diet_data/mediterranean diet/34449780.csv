Two researchers (ML.-B., H.W.) independently searched five online databases: Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Epistemonikos. The search strategy was constructed in consultation with experienced researchers and combined terms related to cognitive functioning as the outcome variable, a set of ‘factor’ terms as the conditional variable, and a third group for specifying the study types, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses.",16c24560-4489-41e4-bb78-f916919b0f61

This strategy was adapted accordingly for all databases (Supplementary Table S2). The search was limited to human studies, the English language, journals and periodicals, and the time period: 1 January 2009–1 August 2019. An additional search for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on social factors only was conducted on 10 January 2022, with an applied publication period of 1 June 2019–31 December 2021.

Data Extraction and Synthesis  Systematic overviews enable wide, but not deep, searches for certain topics; thus, the aim of this overview was to ‘provide a summary of existing research syntheses related to a given topic or question, not to re-synthesize, for example, with meta-analysis or meta-synthesis, the results of existing reviews or syntheses’ [25]. This paper was focused on presenting the overall frequency of the factors, without exploring the relative significance or contribution of each factor to the development or progression of dementia.  As a starting point, the team of researchers (ML.-B., M.Ł., M.P., I.S., H.W.) screened the selected articles and models on the subject to build a framework of categories. Based on the screening, team discussions, and consultations with specialists in the field, the preliminary list of seven main categories with 59 subcategories was established.",46101653-de88-4d74-8c87-5ca1a5ef80d2

Quality Assessment  Critical appraisal of the methodological quality of SRs and MAs is required when conducting a systematic review of reviews [25]. The authors (M.L.-B., M.Ł., M.P., D.S.) used the AMSTAR checklist [26] to independently assess each article. This tool consists of 11 items, providing a rating of domains for potential bias, and has good face and content validity.

These were supplemented with five more articles received from the social health and reserve in the dementia patient journey (SHARED) consortium members at the identification stage. After the removal of 871 duplicates, titles and abstracts were double-screened in pairs, and 365 records were selected for the full-text review. Of these, 310 met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic overview, as shown on the PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1). Additionally, four publications on social factors were identified through an additional search. The overview describes the results from a total of 314 records.  3.2. Included SRs and MAs Characteristics  The general characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1.

Most publications were carried out within European countries (35.8%, including the UK), followed by China (28.3%), the USA (12.7%), and Australia (7.3%). The number of studies included in the SRs and MAs ranged from 2 to 291 (mean = 27.8). The age categories were created based on the provided age range of participants in the papers. The most commonly reported group was ‘mid-life and late-life’ (45.2%; 40 years and above), then ‘late-life’ (23.6%; 65 years and above), ‘people of all ages’ (13.7%; 18 years and above), and only 1% for ‘young-adulthood and mid-life’ (18–65 years). Within 52 studies, there were no descriptions of the age range of the participants.

The domain with the least points was ‘a provided list of excluded studies’ in the selection process (14.3% of articles). ‘A priori’ scoring of the study design was based on the presence of the study objective and specified criteria for inclusion; hence, this criterion was met by 61.2% of the records.

Reports on Cognitive Health  A systematic review of RCTs, longitudinal, and twin studies in healthy older adults [27] showed that social activity was most consistently associated with better global cognition (improved scores), assessed using global or domain-specific cognitive measures, as well as increased brain volume. Similarly, greater social support and larger social networks were associated with better global cognition, while there was a significant relationship between social contact and better episodic memory and verbal fluency.

One systematic review [30] reported no consistent results on the relationship between cognitive health and social support and social contact in older adults.  3.6.2.

25,methods25," The next review of longitudinal studies on cognitive decline [32] reported an association between poor social contact and loneliness, as well as a small social network, poor social support, and low satisfaction with social ties. Similarly, systematic reviews of cross-sectional studies found that social isolation is associated with an increased risk of dementia, as is loneliness with Alzheimer’s disease [29,33]. Two studies identified a larger social network as protective against cognitive decline or dementia in later life [34,35]. Conversely, a smaller social network (i.e., living alone) has been related to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or increased dementia risk [14,34,35,36,37]. Although one review provided evidence that satisfying contact is associated with a lower risk of dementia and a higher risk in the case of unsatisfying ties, two different SRs reported no significant association with dementia or AD [14,38].",f55ffa4e-642b-44f7-8d63-f6bfd1236a6c

A recent systematic review on Indigenous populations found no association between marital status and dementia but suggested that social connections may be protective against Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia [40]. Maintaining social contact was also described as a protective factor against Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) prevalence [37].  A systematic review and meta-analysis on the risk of dementia [14] emphasized the positive role of social contact, engagement, and participation in social activities in reducing the risk of dementia, and elevated risk in their absence.",c5a86717-159e-4a1a-bd3a-228eaa3d3eda

Discussion  This paper provides a comprehensive summary of 314 systematic reviews and meta-analyses that recognize factors related to cognitive functioning and the development of dementia, with a closer look at the role of social factors and knowledge gaps in the literature.  The obtained results are in line with previous findings that show the main emphasis of dementia research is on risk factors (61.2% of 624 identified factors), while protective factors accounted for 20%.

28,methods28,"3%, the results were inconclusive, suggesting that these factors require further investigation.  The majority of the studies have been grounded in the field of medicine, reporting mainly on the risk factors of dementia (80% of all factors in the ‘somatic diseases & biological’ category), providing the most evidence on somatic comorbidities (50%) and genetic predispositions (28%). The most frequent comorbidities were diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. This may be due to the dominant medical perspective in the field of dementia research and a bias towards treatment rather than prevention.  Applying a broad search strategy enabled the discovery of those factors related to different fields, such as health behaviors.",dea41cba-18b1-4ae4-aeac-3e596e2753b6
29,methods29," Hence, those aspects were clustered into the ‘lifestyle’ category, where most factors (46%) were identified as ‘positively’ influencing cognition, pointing to the Mediterranean diet, regular physical activity, cognitively stimulating activities, and maintenance of normal body weight, whereas smoking, heavy alcohol use, and bad sleep patterns were associated with an increased risk of dementia.  Due to the use of subcategories in our review, some of the results contain factors that are differently related to cognitive functioning and dementia. These are, for example, marital status (with single status recognized as a risk factor, while being married is a protective factor), or even cancer (breast cancer chemotherapy having a negative association, while one SR and MA showed that patients with a history of cancer had a 37% decreased risk of AD).",b382660d-0203-4051-a847-7c805c221c2b
30,methods30," Also, due to the heterogeneity of the measures used on the factors and cognitive outcomes in SRs and MAs, and given the multitude of records, it was impossible to draw unambiguous conclusions about the type of impact for most of the factors. Among them, we have found factors which need more longitudinal studies: post-operative cognitive deficits, consumption of caffeine, consumption of alcohol, or weight throughout a lifetime. However, the most consistent results are in line with previous findings on the well-established dementia risk factors—diabetes, smoking, depression, and hypertension, and the protective factors—regular physical activity and a healthy diet [6,8].  The frequently reported factors from other categories were level of education (a high level is related to better cognition and a low level represents a risk factor), depression or its symptoms (the majority of the evidence indicates a negative impact on cognitive health), anxiety and older age (both risk factors).",7c6a7bf3-f5c0-4161-867f-2ea9ab5a2880
31,methods31," In addition, the review aggregated environmental factors such as air pollution, metals exposure, pesticides, or sun exposure, most of which have been shown to have a detrimental effect on cognitive functioning.  The heterogeneous and multi-factorial nature of dementia, confirmed by our findings, requires taking all crucial aspects of health into account when predicting the risk of dementia development and also when planning prevention strategies [41].  4.1. Findings on Social Factors in the Context of Other Research  Social factors and their influence on cognition represents one of the key aims of this review. The findings showed many inconsistencies between the included studies. Reports indicated that low social engagement, less participation in social activities, social isolation, being single, divorced, or widowed, having unsatisfying social ties, and having a small social network can contribute to an elevated risk of dementia.",f9554856-4fa6-45bb-aff5-63ef33ec9b22
32,methods32," This is in line with previous research showing that poor social networks and social disengagement are associated with cognitive decline and dementia by impacting physiological, psychological, and behavioral pathways [42,43,44]. The results indicate that while greater support and frequent contact may confer some protection against cognitive decline and dementia by reducing the risk or delaying the onset, the findings were not completely consistent. Although social interactions are quite often perceived as protective factors against cognitive impairment [45], we found that this has not been explored as extensively as has lifestyle and physical health factors. This contradicts recent findings [6] that social integration is one of the key modifiable factors influencing the trajectory of cognitive performance, among well-grounded factors such as physical activity, smoking, or mental stimulation.",bf36b170-e103-46a3-9c4a-a62d6fd7e88b
33,methods33," Hence, further exploration of social factors can improve the consistency and quality of this evidence and thus lead to more effective methods for intervention [46,47]. This is important as meta-analyses demonstrate that each protective factor decreases the chances of cognitive impairment, even in the presence of risk factors [9].  4.2. Research Gaps and Implications for Future Studies  The overview allowed for the identification of gaps in existing dementia research. First, the evidence regarding cognitive reserve and its indicators is very limited—only two records [48,49] focused on identifying CR determinants. In light of its well-established mechanism for coping with brain damage or cognitive impairments, it is an urgent area for further investigation in the context of dementia [50]. Secondly, the categorization of factors made it possible to compare areas in terms of the amount of data available.",d0a65444-f3f7-46bc-8c61-291ec9d86d39
34,methods34," An uneven amount of evidence is observed between the relatively neglected positive aspects of psychology (e.g., self-efficacy, self-acceptance, and autonomy) and the dominant focus on mental symptoms or illnesses. Thirdly, although the category ‘lifestyle’ was the only one in which most factors were positively associated with cognitive health, associations for many factors were inconsistent. Further research that addresses the modifiable factors is still needed. Finally, as more studies focused on dementia rather than on the trajectory of cognitive decline to dementia, it is relevant to initiate longitudinal studies mapping the whole cognitive pathway in order to identify those factors which play a role in the earlier stages.  4.3. Strengths and Limitations  One of the key advantages of the current review was the implementation of a transparent methodology with a systematic search, selection, and analysis of the relevant literature, allowing for the replication of our findings.",024da5c8-f1a0-49ec-a737-e376b45e098b
35,methods35," The scope of this review was broad; hence, the search was designed to comprehensively identify the relevant literature. For this reason, a large number of studies were selected for review, which is an advantage in summarizing evidence by combining research from various scientific fields and obtaining a wider perspective that leads to a better understanding of the topic. The synthesis of reviews and meta-analyses from the last 13 years presents the state of knowledge and current research trends. The main strength of the study was its holistic approach, identifying the role of various factors in the entire cognitive health trajectory. This is also the first such extensive review that examines the role of social aspects against other factor clusters, emphasizing an integrative understanding of health.  However, this review has several limitations.",8a83b1e1-d7f7-45e0-afe2-4b3844fb6190
36,methods36," Although the inclusion criteria of SR and MA allowed for a methodology appraisal, it was not possible to compare and assess the reliability of the results obtained from individual original studies due to the heterogeneity in the methods used to combine the findings. Another limitation is the exclusion of very recently published primary studies and non-English publications. Given that social aspects are of increasing interest in dementia research worldwide, it would be relevant to include other types of publications from different countries in future reviews.  5. Conclusions  Connecting biological, medical, psychological, and social factors to the development and course of dementia in a novel, complex model provides opportunities for a greater understanding of cognitive decline with aging and can create a basis for its prevention and the modification of its course. Neglected research areas, such as studies on cognitive reserve and positive psychological aspects, should be targeted.",66058a98-0b6b-4e94-abaf-f962cc0edae6
37,methods37," The protective role of social factors in the trajectory of dementia aligns with the recent findings on social engagement being an indicator of cognitive reserve [12,13]. This confirms a need to expand research efforts around social health, which may play a buffering role, slowing down the development of the disease or reducing the degree of cognitive decline that occurs during aging.
