0,introduction0,"Atherosclerosis, the pathological substratum of coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)), is a low-grade chronic inflammatory disease of the vascular wall initiated by the accumulation of cholesterol-laden inflammatory cells (monocytes and T-lymphocytes) in the subendothelial space in a self-perpetuating process that leads to the formation of atheroma plaques, the hallmark of the disease [1]. Inflammatory mediators such as adhesion molecules (selectins, integrins) and interleukins (e.g., IL-6, IL-1β, IL-18) participate in this process. In some instances, the atheroma plaque becomes unstable, leading to cap rupture and ensuing thrombosis that occludes the artery and finally, induces cardiovascular events such myocardial infarction or stroke [2]. Some of these inflammatory mediators (e.g.",76f5c089-a03f-4004-9237-acecf510b09f
1,introduction1,", C-reactive protein [CRP], IL-6, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1], vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1]) have been considered as useful predictive markers of atherosclerosis [3], whereas other biomarkers (matrix metalloprotease-9 and IL-18) have been associated with plaque vulnerability [4].  The PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) study is the first randomized clinical trial designed to assess the beneficial effects of the MD on the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in elderly subjects at high cardiovascular risk. Up to now the PREDIMED study has demonstrated that adherence to the MD is associated with a reduced incidence of diabetes [5]–[6], the metabolic syndrome [7], hypertension [8], and better control of other cardiovascular risk factors [9]–[10]. In fact, Estruch et al [11] have recently reported that a MD intervention reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events by 30% in subjects at high cardiovascular risk.",32f4a88c-4799-4a0c-a210-e5491d79c9f6
2,introduction2," However, improvement in classical cardiovascular risk factors associated with the MD intervention could not fully explain the protective effect of the MD against coronary heart disease (CHD) [11]. Some authors have suggested that, at least in the short term, MD reduces oxidative stress [12], vascular inflammation [13]–[14], and endothelial dysfunction [15], all of which are related to atheroma plaque formation. Thus, in a previous study we have observed lower serum concentrations of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E- and P-selectin, CRP and IL-6, as well as a down-regulation of adhesion molecules on T-lymphocyte and monocyte surfaces after 3 months of MD intervention [10], [14], [16]. However, whether this effect is maintained in the long run is unknown. Moreover, little is known about the effect of the MD on markers of plaque vulnerability.",4a4fe1ce-8e88-4606-af91-3ead7079836d
3,introduction3," Therefore, we embarked on a study to assess 1-y changes in inflammatory biomarkers of atherosclerosis as well as markers of plaque instability in a free-living population with high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) participating in the PREDIMED study.

4,methods0,"The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1.  Subjects and Design The PREDIMED study is a parallel-group, multicenter, randomized, controlled 5-year clinical trial aimed to assess the effects of the MD on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) (http://www.predimed.es) [17]. Recruitment took place between October 2003 and January 2009, and the 7447 participants were randomly assigned to one of three interventions (two Mediterranean diets enriched with extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) or mixed nuts, and a control low-fat diet). The design, methodology and eligibility criteria for the PREDIMED study have been previously described [10]–[11], [17]. Briefly, we recruited men aged 55 to 80 years and women aged 60 to 80 years with no previously documented cardiovascular disease (CVD).",c4256f45-7368-44da-a571-2272c0478f8f
5,methods1," They were eligible if they had type 2 diabetes, or 3 or more major cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, high plasma LDL-cholesterol, low plasma HDL-cholesterol, overweight or obesity, current smoking, or a family history of premature coronary heart disease). At baseline and after 12 months of follow-up, the participants filled out a 137-item validated food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)), a 14-item questionnaire assessing adherence to the MD and the Minnesota leisure-time physical activity questionnaire. We also recorded medication use, measured anthropometric parameters and blood pressure, and collected fasting blood and a spot urine samples, as described previously [14].  In the current study we screened 193 consecutive potential participants from October 2003 to November 2004 in a primary care center associated with the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, Spain, but 29 did not fulfill the inclusion criteria.",b8a3ad26-2c52-4a4a-89b1-53e03358d29b
6,methods2," Thus, 164 were finnaly included in this substudy. Main outcome measures were 12-month changes in classical cardiovascular risk factors, and inflammatory markers predictive of atherosclerosis or related to plaque instability.  Diets After two screening visits with the dietician, participants who fullilled inclusion criteria signed an informed consent and were randomily assigned in a 1∶1∶1 ratio to one of three dietary interventions (MD+extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), MD+Nuts or low-fat diet). Randomization was performed centrally by means of a computer-generated random-number sequence. All of the participants had a face-to-face interview with the dietician and a group session at the baseline visit and quarterly thereafter. The dietary intervention in the three treatment groups was delivered by the same dietician as described [11]. The group sessions were organized separately for each of the three intervention groups.",360b3c23-ae95-4fc7-a5e6-c3e916f75ff5
7,methods3," In each session the 14-point score of adherence to the MD was the main tool to change dietary habits for the two MDs, and a similar 9-point score was used in the participants of the low-fat diet group. The focus in the MD groups was to change portion sizes and the frequency of intake of the different foods and to modify cooking methods towards the traditional MD of Mediterranean countries in the sixties. Thus, participants in both MD groups were recommended to increase the intake of vegetables (≥2 servings/d), fresh fruit (≥3 servings/d), legumes, nuts, fish or seafood (≥3 servings/wk), and the use of olive oil for cooking and dressings, as previously described [11]. The focus in the control group was to reduce all types of fat, with particular emphasis on recommending the consumption of lean meats, low-fat dairy products, cereals, potatoes, pasta, rice, fruits and vegetables.",30d6f642-6f5a-4865-a1ee-522aad3aa097
8,methods4," All participants were provided with descriptions of seasonal foods, shopping lists, weekly meal plans and cooking recipes, according to the their intervention group. Olive oil and nut industry companies supplied extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (50 mL/d) or 30 g/d of walnuts, almonds and halzelnuts free of charge to the respective MD groups, whereas those in the control group received small nonfood gifts. The fatty acid composition of the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts used in the trial is described elsewhere [10]. No total calorie restriction was advised, nor was physical activity promoted. From the beginning of the study all participants were recommended to not use multivitamin or antioxidant supplements.  Ethics Statement All participants provided informed consent.

PBMCs were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll-Hypaque (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield PoC AC) density-gradient. The expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of PBMCs was analyzed via double direct immunofluorescence with the use of commercial monoclonal antibodies following the manufacturer’s instructions. The adhesion molecules analyzed were: anti-CD49d (Cytogmos), anti-CD11a and anti-CD11b (Bender Medsystems), anti-CD40, anti-CD14 and anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies (Caltag). Cell counts (5000 events for T-lymphocytes and 2000 for monocytes) and fluorescence analysis were performed in a FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) using CellQuest software.

For all laboratory methods, the intra- and inter-assay variation coefficients ranged from 1.8 to 8.9% and from 0.9 to 9.9%, respectively.  Statistical Analyses For a parallel design, the sample size was determined with the ENE 3.0 statistical program (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, United Kingdom) assuming a maximum loss of 10% of participants. To detect a mean difference of 10 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) units on the expression of monocyte CD49d with a conservative standard deviation (SD) of 10, 20 subjects would be needed to complete the study (α risk = 0.05, power = 0.9).",1ff90f5e-900d-4822-8406-8696b5e8d653
13,methods9," The monocyte expression of CD49d was considered the primary outcome and used to determine the sample size, but changes in all endpoints were of equal interest in this study.  We used descriptive statistics with the mean ± SD for the baseline characteristics of the participants. Categorical variables are expressed as percentages. Variables with a skewed distribution (Kolmogorov) were transformed to their natural logarithm for analysis. One-factor analysis of variance or chi-square tests, as appropriate, were used to determine differences in baseline characteristics among the three study groups. Changes in all outcomes were assessed with repeated-measures analysis of variance for the two factors, diet and time, and their interactions. Significant interactions were analyzed by the simple effects test with multiple contrasts of Bonferroni.

None of the groups showed significant Pearson correlation coefficients between monounsaturated acid (MUFA) intake and any of the inflammatory marker concentrations.  Changes in Food and Nutrient Intake during Follow-up The self-reported dietary habits of the participants prior to starting the study were similar among the three groups. Baseline diets were high in fiber, total fat and monounsaturated acid (MUFA) because of a high baseline consumption of olive oil and marine n3 fatty acids due to frequent fish intake (Appendix S1 and S2). The saturated fatty acid (saturated fatty acid (SFA)) and ω3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)) content of the diets was relatively low.",50650dc3-3c03-4868-ba42-b1818661e807
21,results15,"  Dietary intervention resulted in favorable changes in food consumption, mainly in the MD groups (Appendix S1). Accordimgly, after 12 months these subjects showed a significant increase in adherence to the MD pattern (P<0.001).   Appendix S2 shows changes in baseline energy and nutrient intake after the 12-month intervention. At 12 months, the participants in the MD+extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group increased the average urine concentration of the phenolic compound tyrosol 8.0 ng/mL (P<0.02) from a baseline value of 61.0 ng/mL, and hydroxytyrosol increased 39.0 ng/mL (P<0.04) from a baseline value of 205 ng/mL, while the plasma content of and the plasma α linolenic acid (ALA) increased 0.14 mol% (P<0.01) from a baseline value of 0.3 mol% in subjects assigned to the MD+Nuts group. These three parameters were used as an objective measure of compliance in the MD intervention diet groups. ",8866d59a-c0a5-49ad-a2a4-27de3499be0b
22,discussion0,"Higher adherence to a MD intervention supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts, for at least 12 months, were associated with a significant decrease in inflammatory markers related to atheroma plaque formation and plaque instability, in addition to a reduction in BP and plasma LDL-cholesterol concentration [18]–[19]. All of these mechanisms may explain, at least in part, the lower incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and mortality in subjects at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) following a Mediterranean diet as has been recently demonstrated by the PREDIMED study [11].  In the long term, a decrease of 10 or 5 mmHg in systolic or diastolic BP, respectively, is associated with a 40% and 30% reduction in the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction, respectively [20]. Moreover, a 10% reduction in plasma cholesterol concentrations has been associated with a 20% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk [21].",c9be3782-544e-4cc6-b467-a3b0c8c00f4e
23,discussion1,"  In the current paper, we observed a significant decrease of 6 mmHg in systolic BP and 3 mmHg in diastolic BP in both MD groups [10]. This same trend was observed in plasma total-cholesterol concentrations, with a decrease of 5% for the MD+extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and 8% for the MD+Nuts compared to the control group. These declines were also similar to those already observed at 3 months for both MDs [10]. Nonetheless, improvements in BP and the lipid profile can not explain the whole protective action of the MD against atherosclerosis, thereby suggesting the presence of alternative effects.  It is well known that atherosclerosis is a chronic low-grade inflammatory disease of the arterial wall [2]. Thus, modulation of this inflammatory reaction may be another potential way by which the MD protects against atherosclerosis.",a816f3e3-6c1d-4109-b8f7-a8660d1d2719
24,discussion2," In the current study, we detected several antiinflammatory effects in the three diets studied, although they were more intense in subjects allocated to the two MD interventions. These subjects showed a higher down-regulation of adhesion molecules in T-lymphocytes and monocytes compared to those in the control group. Moreover, serum concentrations of endothelial soluble cell adhesion molecules, CRP and IL-6 were also lower in subjects following the two MDs compared to control subjects. These results agree with those previously published by Castaner et al [28] and Estruch et al [10], both based in data from PREDIMED trial, in which a sustained traditional MD supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts may exert health benefits through changes in the transcriptomic response of genes related to cardiovascular risk.",31a68dae-e448-4258-93ce-863d95623a27
25,discussion3," Moreover, the IL-18 and IL-18/IL-10 ratio, which are related to ischemic events in the heart and brain [29]–, were decreased after the MD+nuts and both MD interventions, respectively, suggesting a greater stability of atheroma plaque in patients following a MD diet.  This antiinflammatory effect has already been associated with different interventions related to a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease such as a diet rich in fruit, vegetables and olive oil [22], statins [23], moderate alcohol intake [24] or physical activity [25]. In fact, previous studies have reported that some components of the MD such as extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts may down-regulate inflammatory markers related to atherosclerosis such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E- and P-Selectin, CRP and IL-6 [26]–[27].",41e57ef1-ab2a-4e7f-bdd1-0c2222fce424
26,discussion4,"  When we analyzed the possible mechanisms responsible for the antiinflammatory effect observed in both MD groups, the role of exercise on immunomodulation is probably residual since no changes in physical activity were observed in the three groups. In fact, we only observed a significant increase in physical activity in the low-fat diet group compared to both MD groups, but paradoxically this situation was not associated with a greater antiinflammatory effect as would be expected in this group [25]. Finally, the antiinflammatory effect may be due to a synergistic action among nutrients from key foods of the MD such as extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts.",a012d803-9a9c-4bef-8248-cc580291326e
27,discussion5,"  Interestingly, the antiinflammatory effect of the MD seems to be greater and more intense in the mid-term compared to the short-term [10], [14], while the effect on classical cardiovascular risk factors was similar, thereby suggesting that the MD exerts its effects on lipids and blood pressure relatively quickly (at 3 mo), with the maximum effect on systemic inflammatory biomarkers being achieved later (at 1 y). Thus, in the short-term the effect on BP and the lipid profile is higher, whereas in the mid-term the effect on chronic inflammatory response in the arterial wall is more pronounced.  The strengths of our study are its design as a randomized controlled clinical trial, excellent completion rates, good compliance, and the specific inflammatory biomarkers studied, which are involved in different phases of atheroma plaque formation. Finally, there is the question as to the clinical relevance of the antiinflammatory effects of MD.",05c40c52-8993-4fd8-bbd2-44fb7daf4da1
28,discussion6," However, the recently published results of PREDIMED [11] showing lower cardiovascular morbility and mortality are sufficiently consistent to reject any doubt about the antiinflammatory effect of the MD. Regarding the limitations, this study was performed in subjects at high cardiovascular risk and therefore, the results may not be generalized to the overall population. Moreover, this study was limited to classical cardiovascular risk factors and inflammatory parameters. Thus, we can not exclude other protective effects on other clinical or biological parameters related to cardiovascular risk such as markers of arterial structure and function or oxidative stress.  In summary, the results of our study suggest that the Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts has a dual effect on the prevention of cardiovascular disease improving classical cardiovascular risk factors and also has an intense antiinflammatory effect.",d17d20a7-4a7d-455a-b8c2-ea4426edd32a
29,discussion7," Both of these effects could partially explain the overall beneficial effect of the MD on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease observed in high risk subjects.
