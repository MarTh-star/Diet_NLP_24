0,background0," Evidence indicates that many university students have poor adherence to a healthy diet accompanied by unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. Chrono-nutrition is an emerging field of research that examines the pattern of optimum daily activity in relation to the human's dietary patterns, and their reflections of variable health indicators such as sleep quality. However, there is a scarcity of research that examines the relationship between adherence to the healthy eating pattern, like the Mediterranean diet (MD), with sleep quality and chronotype among university students.

1,methods0," Study Design and Participants  To achieve the study objectives, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among students at the University of Sharjah (UoS), Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UoS is a national university that has a diverse study body, coming from various ethnicities and backgrounds. Data collection was carried out between January and May 2021, using a convenience sampling approach. An email inviting students to take part in the study was sent by the central administration to all students. Students, both males, and females, aged 18 years and above and registered at the university during the time of data collection were eligible to participate in this study. The protocol of this study was designed and implemented in line with the guidelines specified by the Declaration of Helsinki. The survey's protocol and data collection instrument were reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the UoS (REC-21-03-03-09-S).",9252e4fa-7311-47f7-ae98-938ca1ebf28d
2,methods1," Before the start of data collection, participants were presented with a brief introduction about the study, its objectives, and procedure, and were asked to provide a signed electronic informed consent, in case they agreed to participate. Participants were informed that their participation is anonymous and completely voluntary in that they can choose or not to answer any particular question and that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time. Participation was completely voluntary, with no monetary or non-monetary incentives were given to the study participants.  Sample size calculations showed that 479 students are needed to estimate a 13.3% prevalence of good adherence to the MD with a power of 80% and an error margin of 3% (40).

3,methods2,"3% prevalence estimate used in the sample size calculations in this study was based on the results of a previous investigation of adherence levels to the MD among adolescents, conducted in Lebanon, a neighboring country of the Middle East and North African Region (41). The sample was representative of the students' population of the UoS as it included the same proportion of males to females (1:4) at the UoS, the majority of the students were United Arab Emirates (UAE) nationals and/or Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) citizens. Likewise, the medical and health sciences colleges were 4 out of 14 colleges, which is reflected by the number of participants from different college majors (29.6% medical and health sciences and 70.4% from other colleges).  Data Collection Tool  For the data collection, a multicomponent, self-administrated online questionnaire was designed using Google Forms in both the English and Arabic languages.",03e33bbf-febd-406e-b258-5da8b5f3478a
4,methods3," The link for the questionnaire was included within the body of the emails distributed to the participants. A panel of experts, consisting of a clinical nutritionist, a nutrition epidemiologist, and a public health scientist, developed the questionnaire choosing the scales for each of the concepts under study and ensuring its content validity. The questionnaire was first developed in the English language, later translated into Arabic, and back-translated into English. The original and back-translated versions of the questionnaire were compared for consistency and to ensure parallel-form reliability. Following the development of the questionnaire, a pilot test was conducted on 15 students to ensure cultural and context adaptability. The results of the pilot test were not included in the data for this study.",fd67932b-e6c4-418a-8ced-2b870daa43d9
5,methods4,"  The questionnaire consisted of four main sections that addressed (1) sociodemographic characteristics, 2) adherence to the Mediterranean diet, (3) sleep quality, and (4) sleep chronotype. Except for the first section, the questionnaire referred to the month prior to the participation in the study. The average duration for the completion of the questionnaire was 10 min.  Section Introduction included questions to provide the following information about the participants: age (in years), sex (male; female), nationality (Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)-; non-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)), marital status (single, married), income (low: <5,000 United Arab Emirates dirham [AED]; medium: 5,000–10,000 AED and high: >10,000 AED), smoking status (non-smoker, including past smoker, smoker) years spent at the university (<4, ≥4years), cumulative grade point average (cumulative grade point average (CGPA)) ( ≤ 3, >3), and major of studies at the university (health-related, non-health-related).",c96505a0-0de1-4119-b8ce-8965fbc85c46
6,methods5," In addition, participants were asked to report their weight (kg) and height (cm). Accordingly, the participant's body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight (kg)/[height (m)]2.  The second section of the questionnaire examined adherence to the MD. For that purpose, The Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (KIDMED) was used. A systematic review of tools used showed that the KIDMED is the most widely used index to assess adherence to the MD among youth (42). The reliability of this index was found at r = 0.60 among college students (43). This index, first developed by Serra-Majem et al. (44), addressed food habits specific to the Mediterranean region. One of the important advantages of the KIDMED is that it can be self-administered as well as filled by an interviewer. The KIDMED consisted of 16 questions to which the answers could be either yes or no.",f1dc331b-63de-4bb5-a134-496539cf506f
7,methods6," Twelve of those questions were related to positive food habits and were related to the consumption of 1-fruits or fruit juice (daily), 2-second serving of fruit (daily), fresh or cooked vegetables (daily), fresh or cooked vegetables (more than once per day) fish (at least 2–3 times per week), legumes (more than once per week), pasta or rice (≥5 times per week), nuts (at least 2–3 times per week), use of olive oil at home, dairy products (2 yogurts and/or 40 g cheese daily), including cereals or grains for breakfast, and dairy for breakfast. For these positive food habits, the participants obtained 1 point for answering yes and 0 points for answering no, toward their KIDMED score. The remaining four questions, addressed negative food habits, consisting of skipping breakfast, including commercially baked goods or pastries for breakfast, sweets, and candy several times a day, and going to a fast-food restaurant more than once a week.",7161639c-71d4-4b2a-9a37-5fc5f9560987
8,methods7," For each of these four questions, the participant received a −1 if his/her answer was Yes and 0 if his/her answer was No. The sum of the points for all the 16 questions was calculated into a KIDMED score, ranging from (−3) to (+12), with higher scores indicating better adherence. Accordingly participating were grouped into three categories: good adherence (≥8), average (between 4 and 7), and poor ( ≤ 3) (44).  The third section of the questionnaire addressed the sleep quality among study participants (45). The Arabic version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) was used. The Arabic version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was previously investigated for its validity and reliability and was found to be appropriate for use among Arabic-speaking natives (46).",5bbe9852-2ac9-410e-a8c9-801274385917
9,methods8," The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire consisting of 19 questions addressing seven components/domains of sleep quality including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. For each of those components, participants were assigned a score of “0–3,” whereby “0” indicates good, and “3” indicates “worst'. An overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score for sleep quality is generated as the sum of scores for the 7 components. As such, the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) ranged between 0 and 21 with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality. Using the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score, participants were grouped as either having good ( ≤ 5) or poor (>5) sleep quality.",82a2b3aa-ecf6-4985-b533-642bdb606516
10,methods9,"  The last section of the questionnaire examined the participants' sleep chronotype (diurnal preferences) using the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (Morningness Eveningness questionnaire (MEQ)), first developed by Horne and Östberg (47). A review of instruments used to evaluate chronotype indicated that the Morningness Eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) has been the gold standard addressing both sleep-wake information and appetite/exercise preferences while taking into account both psychological and behavioral factors when evaluating chronotypes (48). The Morningness Eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) consisted of 19 questions addressing personal daily sleep-wake habits and the times of day of preference of certain activities. Most of these questions are preferential whereby participants are asked to indicate when, for example, he/she would prefer to wake up or start sleep, rather than when he/she does.",de5975a0-a5c4-4747-bdec-6b23f6f1783b
11,methods10," The Morningness Eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) questions are multiple-choice in nature, with each answer being assigned a specific value. The sum of these values results in an overall score ranging from 16 to 86 which can be categorized as follows: Definitely morning type 70–86, Moderately morning type 59-69, Neither type 42–58, Moderately evening type 31–41, Definitely evening type 16–30. The validity of the Arabic version of the Morningness Eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) was previously established and the results indicated that this version of the questionnaire provided valid and reliable measures of sleep chronotype (49).  Data Analysis  Data analyses for this study were carried out using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)) for Mac HD version 23 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).",ee62b856-5276-4d50-89a4-6df51a5ae6ce
12,methods11," Participants' characteristics were described as mean (standard deviation), and frequency and proportions, for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The characteristics were presented for the overall sample and by adherence to the MD. For the latter, participants were grouped, as per the KIDMED index, into “low”, “medium”, and “high” adherence. Comparisons of participants' characteristics between the poor and high adherence to the KIDMED were carried out using independent student's t-test for continuous variable and Chi-square tests for categorical variables. In order to investigate the effect of adherence to the MD on sleep quality, simple and multiple logistic regressions analyses were carried out, with the adherence to the MD (high vs. low) as the independent variable and sleep quality indicators as dependent variables. Sleep quality indicators consisted of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and its seven components.",6b6b9a1e-818c-4c31-ad07-aa1119ed61e0
13,methods12," The effect of sleep chronotype on adherence to the MD was also examined using simple and multiple logistic regression analyses. For these analyses, the three classes of adherence to the MD were re-categorized into two categories (medium and high as one “High adherence,” and “Low adherence”) and considered as dependent variables, while the five chronotypes were re-categorized into three categories (eveningness, intermediate, and morningness) and entered as the independent variables. For all analyses, variables that showed significant associations with adherence to the MD in the univariate analyses were included in the multiple regression models. Results of the logistic regression analyses were presented as odds ratio (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

19,discussion0," The current study is the first to examine the relationship between adherence to MD, subjectively measured sleep quality using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the chronotype among university students. Findings of the current work showed that greater adherence to the MD is associated with better overall sleep quality and sleep components.  Sleep quality is strongly affected by food quantity and quality, with dietary inflammatory potential has been proposed as one of the inflecting factors that affect sleep quality and duration (50). Providing that lower inflammatory status has been consistently associated with improved sleep quality (51, 52), the well-established low antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of the MD (53) may help to explain, in part, the strong positive association between the good adherence to the MD and the reported good sleep quality components found among our study sample.",d01893f3-3b7b-4f0c-9e54-3359038cad58
20,discussion1," The relationship between sleep and inflammation is controversial and bidirectional (12, 54, 55); that is, when the bodily inflammatory state is increased, the sleep quality is worsened, and when sleep quality is worsened, the inflammatory state becomes increased. The mechanism that elaborates such a relationship stems from the fact that inadequate sleep can increase the inflammatory response through increased cytokine secretion, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6; the cytokines that are classically found to be associated with sleep deprivation (12). These pro-inflammatory cytokines are those consistently reported to be reduced in response to the long-term exposure and adherence to the MD, as revealed by many reports (11, 56).  Another underlying mechanism that explains the relationship between MD and improved sleep quality is the ability of the MD to increase melatonin secretion.",80a40f00-3bae-4046-a9cf-0fc013b41975
21,discussion2," Many fruits and vegetables are good sources of melatonin, and experimental studies reveal that consumption of these phytochemical-rich foods can improve sleep quality parameters and alleviate sleep disturbances (26, 57).  Further, the relationship between poor sleep quality and food intake has been consistently examined. Poor sleep quality and short sleep duration are associated with greater food intake and lower-quality diet, which are increasingly recognized as risk factors for obesity (58, 59). It was proposed that short sleep duration affects energy expenditure and/or energy intake in a way that creates a positive energy balance. Indeed, the sleep restriction triggers energy intake that exceeds the added energy costs of maintaining longer wakefulness (58).",e0fb8240-c19c-4f7f-8412-4dbdabe48645
22,discussion3,"  From a health perspective, the morning chronotype has been the preferred chronotype over the evening one, with the former having less association with cardiometabolic risk factors and other health problems, including psychological, neurological, and gastrointestinal morbidities, and lower mortality rates compared to evening chronotypes (69). These health improvements associated with the morning chronotype could be also a mirror for the improved eating habits consistently reported with such chronotype, as revealed by the increased adherence to the MD by people with morning chronotype (70, 71). The reported low prevalence of morningness chronotype in comparison with the eveningness one (15.1% vs. 24.5%, respectively) among the study sample is expected, considering the frequently observed long stay up at night among surrounding and neighboring students, and in line with the low prevalence reported in other parts of the world. Similar distributions of morning chronotype (15.8 and 18.",d182b884-d5f8-401c-9342-8ceca190ebc2
23,discussion4,"4%) were found among university students in Italy and China, respectively (72, 73). Such pattern of chronobiology among university students could be explained, in part, by the same aforementioned factors affecting their food selection and eating behaviors; that is the hectic schedule, high demanding and frequent academic tasks, and exams, with the students' persistent endeavor to catch the due dates and deadlines and to find less distracting times and more silent surrounding environment. Further, the excessive use of mobile applications and the massive reliance on blue screens for socialization play a role, in part, for such outcomes. Thirdly, the reported positive correlation between eveningness and higher cognitive ability [explaining why more people with higher cognitive ability are more likely to be nocturnal than others (74)] may explain the predominance of eveningness chronotype over other chronotypes among university students (73).",db8c54a5-7fea-4dd5-9843-07bd1321e9b5
24,discussion5," Lastly, the frequently reported consumption of stimulant beverages such as caffeine-rich energy drinks and coffees (32, 33, 75) is among the fundamental factors for extending the wake night hours and shifting the chronotype into the eveningness pattern among university students. This finding of the predominance of eveningness pattern is consistent with the increased prevalence of sleep problems among university students, especially medical students, as revealed by our previously published systematic review and meta-analysis (39).  The relatively low prevalence of good sleep quality (about 17%) among our university students is also consistent with and mirrors for other reports in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and other parts of the globe. However, this number is lower than previous estimates among students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), whereby the prevalence rates of good sleep, using similar assessment tools were 34% in 2020 and 44.8% in 2021, respectively (50, 76).",47ae5f21-b0ae-4256-b288-fec46e350187
25,discussion6," Such a high heterogeneity in the reported prevalence of sleep quality among students in the same institute during two consecutive years is a mirror for the wide spectrum of interacting and interplaying variables impacting sleep quality, and the high sensitivity of sleep quality for variable environmental (dietary and lifestyle) factors. Parallel with the previous outcomes, the use of energy drinks among university students in the UoS was found to be significantly associated with reduced sleep quality, as revealed in our previous work in 2017 (32).  Having three-times higher reported good sleep quality among those with morningness chronotype than those with the evening one (30.3% vs. 10.6%), found in this study, is consistent with other reports among university students throughout the world, such as in Brazil (77, 78), India (79) and Korea (80), where eveningness chronotype was consistently associated with poorer sleep quality.",c73ccaf7-6bcc-4a23-9896-31e79bb4d5c6
26,discussion7," Such a strong relationship is a reflection of the direct interaction between circadian rhythm and sleep in response to the chronotype (81). In a similar work among university students in Brazil, evening-style students with poor sleep quality presented shorter total sleep time, higher sleep latency, and late-onset of sleep; all imply a kind of lack of compatibility between the biological rhythms and the morning academic demands. Such incompatibility generates successive daily desynchronizations. Further, with morning academic duties, students with evening chronotype are more prone to be anxious in relation to their personality, which indicates a greater irregularity of the sleep-wake cycle than the other chronotypes, and puts them at higher risk of impairment of cognitive and psychological processes, social jet lag, and consequently, worse quality of life and academic performance and (78).",cac6462d-4d1e-42a6-8d61-22d26887b0ed
27,discussion8,"  Age and sex are factors that are variably associated with the adherence to the MD (60), with conflicting results that have been found for the relationships with adherence to MD (61). Consistent with our findings, older age is one of the determining factors for the degree of adherence to the MD (60, 62). For instance, lower adherence to the MD during two decades from 1985 to 2005 in South Italy was found to be more pronounced in younger people than in older people (30–49 vs. 50–69 years) (62), while higher age was also associated with more adherence to the MD among patients with food neophobia in Italy (60). These findings are in line with the dominant nutrition transition taking place in many countries in the world, where traditional and healthier dietary patterns are slowly eroding and being replaced by “westernized” patterns of food consumption.",f44fcee8-e839-40ba-bf8a-fa1836be6527
28,discussion9," This nutrition transition is most pronounced among the younger population, who are most susceptible to the globalization of food intake and the influence of fast food and processed food chains (63, 64).  Despite the well-known health-improving effects and disease-preventing impact of MD against chronic diseases, a low adherence rate to the MD has been repeatedly reported, especially in the Mediterranean countries themselves (61, 65), with sex has been identified as one of the multiple factors working as predictors of poor adherence to the MD (61). The superiority of females in reporting more adherence to the MD diet in our work is consistent with previous work showing that male personality traits were associated with low MD adherence among patients with ischemic heart disease (ischemic heart disease (IHD)) (66).",aaef41dd-c914-4acc-a15b-b7d43217d43a
29,discussion10," However, female sex was shown to be more associated with low adherence in comparison to males in another study in Italy among adults with ischemic heart disease (IHD) (61), implying that various other factors such as age, health condition, cultural, demographic, and socioeconomic variables may play a role in determining the level of adherence to the MD.  Having fewer fruits than recommended, skipping breakfast, and frequently visiting fast-food restaurants reported among university students in our work is consistent with the repeatedly observed unhealthy behaviors among the university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and other parts of the world (67, 68). University students' diets are low in fruits and vegetables and high in fats, carbohydrates, and sodium, making them energy-dense yet nutrient-poor options.",641980ef-b85f-4f0c-b557-b9654cc9f320
30,discussion11," In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), university students have been found to eat unplanned meals consisting primarily of quick, unhealthy, energy-dense foods (36), and have been observed to consume a lot of fast food and soft drinks, as well as skipping meals (34, 37). Such unhealthy eating behaviors and poor food selections by university students have been ascribed to variable environmental factors that characterize the university academic life, such as the hectic schedule, high demanding and frequent academic tasks, and exams.  The current work entails some limitations that should be considered when interpreting the current findings. First, diet quantity was not examined in the current work, which may also affect sleep quality and may interact with different components of sleep. The inherent limitations of the cross-sectional design cannot be overridden in this context, where causality cannot be inferred in such an observational design.",f40c3264-9e9c-4730-9776-fa00cbe46113
31,discussion12," Other limitations related to the self-reported questionnaires such as recall bias, and response bias are worth to be kept in mind. Of particular importance is the self-reported nature of the assessment of sleep quality, which relies heavily on the participants' subjective assessment. Future studies could include objective measures of sleep quality, using polysomnography (82). In addition, this study explored only the associations between adherence to MD and sleep quality, not the mechanisms behind these associations. This study also does not account for possible confounding factors that may affect the relationship, such as evening thermogenic factors like nocturnal exercise, nocturnal light exposure, and spicy nocturnal meals, and physical activity level. Lastly, adjustments for the alpha value for multiple comparisons that were not performed need to be considered in future studies.",28d22d99-baf5-4fb2-b4e2-2c8722ad47f6
32,discussion13,"  To conclude, good adherence to the MD among university students is more associated with morningness chronotype and improved overall sleep quality and sleep components. Improving the knowledge and attitude of the university students toward their dietary and lifestyle behaviors, and the significance of chronotype in determining their future disease risk factors are of pivotal importance. Further long-term, controlled intervention research works are warranted for more elaboration on the impact of chronotype and dietary habits on sleep quality.
