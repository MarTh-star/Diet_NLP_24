0,introduction0,"Obesity is an aetiological condition associated with some types of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases such as type-2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and hypertension1. Nowadays, it is widely accepted that the combination of high-energy diets, genetic make-up, sedentary lifestyles and gut dysbiosis (impaired composition and functionality of the gut microbiota) are involved in the obesity pandemic2–4. The prevalence of these significant health threats has risen to shocking proportions worldwide, including countries like Spain with ancestral adherence to the Mediterranean diet5. The increase in the rate of obesity has been mainly attributed to the ‘Westernization’ of the diet, the decrease of physical activity from childhood, currently aggravated by the abuse of playing videogames, and the increasingly early access to digital devices such as smartphones6. However, other potential variables could be participating in this pandemic.",18eee323-918a-4cf0-8951-177324d41db7
1,introduction1,"  Many studies have associated obesity in children and adults with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For example, in genome-wide association studies (genome wide association studies (GWAS)), the rs9939609 SNP in the fat-mass-and-obesity-associated (fat mass and obesity associated (FTO)) gene has been reported to account for a modest, but a statistically significant, increase of 0.4 kg/m2 body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) units for each risk allele (A)7. Although it is not fully understood yet, this association is partially mediated via controlling feeding behaviour8. However, not all the studies report this association, including those conducted in the child population9,10.",1bd0c8de-5ce3-4c59-a34e-47b2dc818c3c
2,introduction2," Indeed, more than one million SNPs have been detected in the human genome11, and thus, instead of only one or few specific SNPs, it is more conceivable to expect the complex action of a consortium of SNPs potentially interacting with many other variables and associated with different conditions, including obesity.  The gut microbiota is also involved in the pathophysiology of obesity, although the associated mechanisms are not fully known yet3. Nevertheless, a number of pathways have been identified such as the translocation of lipopolysaccharides (lipopolysaccharides (LPS)) from the gut to the bloodstream12, the regulation of gut hormones, energy harvest, inflammatory responses, lipogenesis and immune interactions13 as well as the regulation of white adipose tissue inflammation via microRNAs14. Recently, a potential nexus between the dissimilar metabolism of some dietary constituents by the microbiota and obesity has been proposed.",32224af1-a2a8-432f-a0d4-cda0a29bca9f
3,introduction3," This has been suggested for the metabolism of the polyphenols isoflavones15 and ellagitannins16–18 that yield specific metabolites19, that is, equol and(or) O-desmethylangolensin (O desmethylangolensin (ODMA)) in the case of isoflavones20, and different urolithin combinations in the case of ellagitannins17. These particular types of metabolisms, in the context of polyphenols, give rise to specific metabolizing phenotypes: the so-called ‘metabotypes’16,19. A metabotype is characterized by the production of specific metabolites derived from the gut microbiota (which are characteristic of the precursor polyphenol metabolism), and also by the associated microbial ecology in terms of composition and activity16,19. Therefore, the capacity to excrete high or low amounts of microbial-derived metabolites is not within the concept of metabotype19.",74c77c3d-729b-4d7e-ba1c-74703f161c0b
4,introduction4," The definition of metabotypes in the metabolism of polyphenols, only fits currently for the equol and(or) O desmethylangolensin (ODMA) ‘producers’ vs ‘non-producers’ metabotypes in the case of isoflavones20, and also for the urolithin metabotypes associated with the metabolism of ellagitannins, i.e., metabotype A (UM-A; individuals that produce only urolithin A), B (UM-B; production of isourolithin A, urolithin B and also urolithin A) and 0 (UM-0; urolithin non-producers)17,19 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The occurrence of specific gut microbiota metabotypes is behind the inter-individual variability upon polyphenol consumption21,22 and could be indirect markers of gut dysbiosis reflecting the individuals’ gut microbiota composition, richness, diversity, and functionality19,23–25.",d4340786-ec3e-42e4-9042-630577180963
5,introduction5," Although the gut microbiota associated with UM-B and UM-0 individuals show a dysbiotic-prone pattern25, however, the unequivocal association between these metabotypes with obesity has not been confirmed so far due to its multifactorial aetiology25,26.  In the present study, we aimed to assess the probabilities of being overweighed or obese in a cohort of children and adolescents from the Southeast of Spain by estimating the odds ratios (ORs) for different predictor variables and their relative importance in the prediction of the response. In this proof-of-concept, we considered as predictor variables the urolithin metabotypes as biomarkers of the gut microbiota, ethnicity, age, sex, the adherence to the Mediterranean diet, physical activity, and a consortium of 53 SNPs from 43 genes mainly related to obesity and cardiometabolic diseases.

The study was conceived to stratify the participants according to their urolithin metabotypes after three days of walnuts or pomegranate juice consumption26 and was not intended to modify any variable in the children. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03318042), and the Spanish National Research Council’s Bioethics Committee (Madrid, Spain) approved the protocol. Inclusion criteria were ages from 5 to 17 years old and good health status. Exclusion criteria were diagnosed pathology, previous gastrointestinal surgery, chronic medication and antibiotic intake one month before participating. A total of 415 children and adolescents were randomly recruited.",16bf36be-c878-4d83-b9b2-98aa874f1a46

Parents were fully informed and gave their written informed consent before the participation of all students.  Urolithin metabotypes Children and adolescents consumed 25 g peeled raw walnuts daily or 250 mL of pomegranate juice daily (in the case of individuals allergic to nuts) for three days. Packs of peeled walnuts were kindly provided by Borges International Group, S.L.

9,methods3," The child growth standards from the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) were used to define the body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) cut-offs for underweight, normoweight, overweight and obese individuals as a function of sex and age5. The students were asked to record possible incidences (medication, protocol compliance, etc.), and also their physical activity level28, which took into account the two hours of physical activity a week in their schools (low activity) and the practice of additional extracurricular sports at least three days a week (high activity). Besides, a validated questionnaire to assess the adherence to the Mediterranean diet in children (KIDMED) was used29. The score in this questionnaire (ranging from 1 to 13, from very poor to optimum adhesion, respectively) was grouped as ‘Low’ (score from 1 to 4), ‘Medium’ (from 5 to 8), and ‘Good’ (from 9 to 13).",3e5f3143-6970-4a04-b8a8-c94d4a35e728

On the same day of the anthropometric evaluation, saliva samples were obtained by gently rubbing the inside part of the cheek with a sterile swab, free of human RNA and DNA (Deltalab, Barcelona, Spain). Children were asked to clean their mouths and avoid eating or drinking 60 min before collection of samples to prevent contaminations. Two samples were obtained per student.

12,analysis0,"A proportional-odds logistic ordinal regression was used to model the data with the software R version 3.5.1 (www.r-project.org). Nine subjects with >40% missing SNPs were removed, resulting in a final sample size of 406 students (Supplementary Fig. 2). The missing data was singly imputed using the missForest R package. Redundant predictors (rs9928094-fat mass and obesity associated (FTO), rs9935401-fat mass and obesity associated (FTO)) were identified and removed using the Hmisc R package. SNPs with either favourable or unfavourable genotype frequencies below 5% were also removed (rs4994-ADRB3, rs7913948-ALOX5, rs7412-APOE, rs328-LPL, rs16139-NPY, rs6008259-PPARγ, rs2066826-PTGS2) (Supplementary Table 1).

13,analysis1," Consequently, data reduction was applied to the SNPs by applying Multiple Correspondence Analysis (Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)) and using only the first 15 Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) dimensions. Ethnic groups representing less than 1% each were merged into the ‘Other’ category.  Wald tests for all the predictors in the model were generated, and they were further ranked by importance based on the χ2-degrees of freedom (-df) score. A simplified model was obtained by applying a ‘fast-backwards’ variable elimination approach37 based on the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC)38. The approximate βs and ORs (and their 95% confidence intervals, CI) of the remaining variables were reported.

14,analysis2," The significant contributions (coefficients of determination R2 with p values < 0.05) of SNPs to the essential Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) dimension were plotted to deconvolute it.  We used the proportional odds assumption in the model. ‘Physical activity’, ‘KIDMED’ and ‘Urolithin metabotype’ showed some deviation from this assumption. However, alternative extended continuation ratio models with this assumption relaxed for these variables did not result in better models according to the AIC, i.e., the higher complexity of the model was not compensated by the increase in the fit. The inclusion of transformations of some predictors, including a restricted cubic spline for both ‘Age’ and ‘KIDMED’, did not result in improved models, as judged by the AIC.",e53cae2e-8f0e-4eef-b8f9-117935566a7f
15,analysis3," Finally, a genetic score (computed as the sum of risk alleles) was also tested as a possible surrogate for the SNPs variables, but this did not result in a better replacement for the Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) dimensions. All tests were bilateral, with a significance level of 0.05.  Other statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS software, v23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). When more than two groups were compared, analyses of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni-corrected t-test (for post-hoc analysis) or the Kruskal–Wallis followed by Dunn’s test were used for normally and non-normally distributed data, respectively (KIDMED score vs fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) genotype TT, AT or AA, etc.). Comparison of non-normally distributed quantitative variables between two clusters was approached using the Mann-Whitney U-test (fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) TT genotype vs body mass index (BMI) or waist, etc.).",c4cd8501-6d54-4d66-80c5-db883e1775c1

19,results7,"    Regarding the SNPs analysed, after correcting for multiple tests, three SNPs did not satisfy the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)) (rs1801253, rs5082, rs11868035) (Supplementary Table 1). The rest of the SNPs were in equilibrium and were close to European frequencies. In the case of these three SNPs, we can speculate that the reason could be the association established by the presence of certain consanguinity (several sibling groups in the cohort). Nevertheless, this did not affect our results, since we aimed to compare variables from different domains and not only in estimating the particular effect of a single SNP. Overall, it is not absolutely necessary to have Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in our approach, i.e., to estimate odds ratios of an Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) dimension and rank the predictors.  The distribution of urolithin metabotypes in this cohort (Fig.",e96f2f8f-431b-4f87-8084-e27f610c7dad

No significant association between physical activity and overweight-obesity distribution was found (results not shown). On the contrary, there were many overweight-obese children with high physical activity, which should be explained as a consequence of their overweight-obesity status (results not shown). Regarding the diet, the KIDMED scores showed mean values of 6.9 ± 2.1 for the entire cohort (Supplementary Table 2) and ranged from the lowest value of 5.7 ± 1.4 in 15-year-old girls to the highest value of 8.8 ± 2.2 in 6-year-old boys (Fig. 2A). However, no significant differences were found between boys and girls as well as through the range of age (Fig. 2A).

Therefore, although both the urolithin metabotypes and rs9939609 SNP-fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) could partially contribute to the overweight-obesity distribution as independent predictor variables in this cohort of children and adolescents; however, all the possible SNP-SNP interactions together with the rest of variables had not been taken into account.",59c7e9bd-d4bf-427e-9622-fa21174c5694

31,discussion1," However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies that explore the occurrence of overweight-obesity in children and adolescents by estimating the odds ratios for the predictor variables ‘urolithin metabotypes’ as gut microbiota biomarkers, ‘age’, ‘sex’, ‘adherence to the Mediterranean diet’, and an identified consortium of 24 SNPs from 22 genes, mainly related to obesity and cardiometabolic diseases.  The purpose of the ordinal logistic regression model was to estimate the odds ratios of the different explanatory variables and rank them by importance, rather than a tool to predict the probability of overweight and obesity of new individuals. There are in the literature several previous reports that model the probabilities of overweight and obesity in children through ordinal regression models42–46.",4b7c34d4-50d7-48cf-945a-f6a1374e51f0
32,discussion2," However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this type of model is used with such a wide set of predictors comprising different putatively influencing domains (genetic, diet, exercise, microbiome urolithin metabotype, and ethnicity, in addition to sex and age) and ranks them according to their relative importance. The χ2-df score returned the following importance ranking: age >SNP.Dim.14 >ethnicity >sex >urolithin metabotype >KIDMED; while physical activity seemed to have a negligible importance. The use of an AIC-based fast-backwards reduction of the model removed ‘Ethnicity’ from the final model, probably because of the large number of categories in this predictor42, that would be highly penalised by the AIC criterion. Besides, our sample was mainly of Caucasian-European origin (93.5%), and it is expected that in a sample with a more balanced distribution of ethnicity, this predictor would have high importance.",30f86c74-66e8-4308-93c1-c4cda6d72a56
33,discussion3," Furthermore, the modest predictive capability of the model suggested the need for additional predictors, which is not unexpected, given the multifaceted aetiology of obesity. Still, the model, derived for estimating purposes, allowed us to rank predictors of different domains by their importance, as well as to estimate odds ratios for them.  The classification of overweight and obesity in adults is rather simple and independent of age and sex (i.e. 25 ≤ body mass index (BMI) < 30 for overweight, and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 for obesity). However, the World Health Organization (WHO)-based definition for overweight-obesity in children and teens uses age- and sex-based percentiles5, and a higher body mass index (BMI) does not necessarily correspond with overweight-obesity in growing children. Therefore, using overweight and obesity as response variables instead of body mass index (BMI) values is especially useful in children and adolescents.",46ec1738-6320-4341-baad-029e911f420e
34,discussion4," This is due to the difficulty in comparing them at different ages and of the two sexes, given the remarkable, sex-dependent change in weight and height, during this period of development (i.e., while our model predicted that overweight-obesity decreases upon ageing, the use of body mass index (BMI) yielded the opposite result, masking the real result). Still, sex and age were essential predictors in our model, with estimated ORs of 1.67 for boys, and 0.88 for a one-year increase, respectively, which means an increased percentage of overweighed-obese boys, and a reduction of overweight-obesity upon ageing.  The gut microbiota contributes to the pathophysiology of obesity3, and a recent report shows the role of gut microbial metabolites in the expression of the microRNA-181 family, which regulates white adipose tissue inflammation and obesity in children14.",18409f99-577e-4f9e-b91d-d89059ae06fe
35,discussion5," However, the gut microbiota, as a predictor of childhood obesity, has been scarcely approached and not usually considered together with SNPs and other variables. In a targeted approach, among a few analysed microbial groups, Scheepers et al. reported that the Bacteroides fragilis group was associated with childhood weight development47. Later, Rampelli et al. connected the onset of obesity in children to an increase of Proteobacteria and a decrease of Clostridiaceae and Ruminococcaceae48. In the same line, Bai et al. described that the Proteobacteria phylum had significantly enriched OTUs for higher body mass index (BMI) levels in a cohort of children from the American Gut Project49. This is relevant since the microbiota-associated with UM-B is enriched in Proteobacteria25. Interestingly, Nirmalkar et al. reported that the Coriobacteriaceae family was 3-fold more abundant in obese children and adolescents than normoweight50.",89f47a7a-a3f8-4265-b925-917ff11599a9
36,discussion6," Specifically, the genus Collinsella was more abundant in obese adolescents, a microbial group that could be related to the endothelial dysfunction50,51. Overall, all these results are remarkable since we recently reported that UM-B was enriched in the Coriobacteriaceae family, which was positively correlated with blood total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and body mass index (BMI) in adults25. Although we had previously observed a trend between UM-B occurrence and overweight-obesity in adult individuals, however, we could not establish a definitive link probably due to the lack of other interacting factors such as those included in the present study (SNPs, diet, etc.)26,52.",14193e58-139e-4316-8f1b-b25f5a6bf388
37,discussion7," Therefore, the Coriobacteriaceae family, and probably the Proteobacteria phylum, more abundant in obese children as well as in UM-B, could be the link between UM-B occurrence and overweight-obesity, which suggests that the microbiota associated with urolithin metabotypes could contribute in the prediction of the probability of being overweighed or obese. Regarding UM-0, its occurrence in the population is approximately constant (~10%), although there is both a higher occurrence and variability in the childhood26. The microbiota associated with UM-0 has been reported to show lower diversity than UM-B and UM-A, which could be indicative of an obesity-prone microbiota4. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude a possible shift of metabotype in children from UM-0 to either UM-A or UM-B determined by ageing26 or after ellagitannin-rich diets as previously described in adults21.",290f0b8b-a853-4d7c-bd1c-61449219ae31
38,discussion8,"  Regarding the possible health implications of belonging to one or another metabotype, we have recently reported that urolithin metabotypes determined the different restoration capacity of the gut microbiota and the anthropometric values (weight, waist and hip) of healthy women up to 12 months after delivery53. The gut microbiota of pregnant women is in dysbiosis, which persists at least 1 month after delivery. We observed that the gut microbiota associated with UM-B was more resilient than that of UM-A, which would have negative implications in the dysbiotic-prone UM-B. In contrast, the gut microbiota of UM-A women progressively became normal during the year after childbirth. Therefore, we suggested that the determination of urolithin metabotypes in pregnant and lactating women could be a useful tool to predict their predisposition to the recovery of the gut microbiota and anthropometric values, significantly altered during pregnancy and after childbirth53.",f907dc88-557c-4b0e-bb29-b729c48fe829
39,discussion9,"  Many studies describe the association, or lack of association, of specific SNPs with obesity. The rs9939609 SNP-fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) has been reported to confer a predisposition to obesity by regulating the control of food intake and food choice, suggesting a link to a hyperphagic phenotype or a preference for energy-dense foods in Scottish children54. This agrees with the connection between the low adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the risk allele A of rs9939609 SNP-fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) in our cohort. However, we did not observe a clear association of this SNP with overweight-obesity, but only a trend with many exemptions, in agreement with other studies where some SNPs, previously reported to be involved in obesity, such as the rs17782313-MC4R and rs9939609-fat mass and obesity associated (FTO), exerted weak effects and very scarce contribution to obesity in 773 pre-pubertal Portuguese children55.",9b965ec2-3745-4510-942f-18bec66fe7e5
40,discussion10," In the present study, a consortium of 24 SNPs was identified as the second contributing predictor to overweight-obesity in our cohort. The rs1801253 SNP (also called Arg389Gly), located in the gen ADRB1, was the most contributing SNP within this consortium. It is known the involvement of the ADRB1 gene polymorphisms in cardiovascular diseases56 but also in obesity57,58.  The ADRB1 gene codifies a G-coupled protein (the β1-adrenergic receptor) that binds the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine and controls sympathetic responses in the heart, kidney and adipocytes. Interestingly, Dionne et al. reported that the rs1801253 SNP-ADRB1 was associated with higher body weight and body mass index (BMI) in a cohort of Caucasian women (n = 931)57. In the same line, Aradillas-García et al. reported that the rs1801253 SNP-ADRB1, but not the Trp64Arg ADRB3, was associated with obesity in Mexican children59.",6b9dd382-ca0c-4352-b2ba-64c69ee95a23
41,discussion11," The connection between ADBR1 SNPs and obesity could rely on the catecholamines, which are considered significant lipolysis regulators60 and affect differentiation and proliferation of adipocytes61. In this regard, Lee et al.62 established the association between impaired urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion and obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome in a cohort of 577 Chinese subjects.  Overall, all the above highlights again the need to consider SNPs consortia, interacting with other variables, instead of few SNPs in those studies aimed to associate SNPs with obesity. We are aware that the present study is an exploratory validation for a proof-of-concept, i.e., an ordinal logistic model that associates child overweight-obesity with a consortium of SNPs potentially interacting with the urolithin metabotypes-associated microbiota, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, age, and sex.",3f5105b7-89a9-4d9a-8cd4-05acaab3a89c
42,discussion12," Although we claim for the rationale of our approach and its potential usefulness, however, our results should be confirmed with additional research. We also acknowledge some limitations that should be considered in further studies, which also could improve its prediction capability. For example, it would be interesting to include other possible variables, such as the detailed composition and functionality of the individuals’ gut microbiomes, and dietary interventions to evaluate not only associations but also individuals’ responses. The latter would be even better than the use of validated questionnaires. Besides, a higher number of SNPs (or many SNPs associated with a specific gene) should be explored, especially in children from other geographical origins and ethnicities. Also, the inclusion of serobiochemical variables and traits related to obesity and its comorbidities (blood lipid profile, blood pressure, glucose homeostasis, etc.) could yield relevant information.",b925f9a4-11b2-436e-ac56-eb97d3f77a3a
43,discussion13," Finally, a validation cohort (i.e., a parallel-group with all the children either normoweight or obese) should also be considered in further studies to confirm our model fully.  Conclusions The present research highlights the need for a holistic approach to unravel the predictors of overweight-obesity in children. Our results confirm, in agreement with the multifaceted aetiology of obesity, the link of childhood overweight-obesity to multifactorial associations of environmental and genetic components. The ordinal logistic model revealed that child overweight-obesity prevalence was related to being a young boy with either UM-B or UM-0, low KIDMED score and high contribution of a consortium of 24 SNPs, being rs1801253-ADRB1, rs4343-ACE, rs8061518-fat mass and obesity associated (FTO), rs1130864-CRP, rs659366-UCP2, rs6131-SELP, rs12535708-LEP, rs1501299-ADIPOQ, rs708272-CETP and rs2241766-ADIPOQ the top-ten contributing SNPs.",69c45b94-60ca-4f74-8fc6-8a40ec5703dc
44,discussion14," Therefore, it is of particular relevance the evaluation of interactive SNPs consortia along with the stratification of the children according to their urolithin metabotypes, which could be early biomarkers, in the case of UM-B and UM-0, of a dysbiotic-prone obesity-associated microbiota.
