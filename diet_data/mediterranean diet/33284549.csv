0,introduction0," Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of on-duty fatalities among U.S. firefighters. Research has demonstrated that many modifiable risk factors are contributors to the high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors. The current study aimed to assess whether sleep is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors among Indianapolis firefighters. The findings could support improving sleep hygiene in this population.  Material and Methods  This cross-sectional study was conducted from the baseline data of eligible firefighters enrolled in “Feeding America’s Bravest”, a Mediterranean diet lifestyle intervention within the Indiana Fire Departments. Participants’ sleep quality was categorized as “good” (≤ 8 points) or “bad” (>8 points) by a sleep quality questionnaire based on some questions from Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In addition, firefighters’ sleep duration was stratified based on the number of hours slept per night (≤6 as “short sleep” or >6 hours as normal).",d8920696-cb63-4ed4-9e27-954a7beac3d8

2,results0," A total of 258 participants met all study inclusion criteria ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). The firefighters’ scores were ranging from 2 to 17 points. Based on the Sleep Quality Index (SQI), the participants were characterized as bad sleepers (Sleep Quality Index (SQI)>8) and as good sleepers (Sleep Quality Index (SQI) ≤ 8). One-third of them (31%) reported short sleep duration at home (≤6 hours per night), at firehouse, most of them (79.1%) reported short sleep duration per night, while half of them (54.3%) reported short sleep duration in a 24-hours period including naps. The demographic characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 1 , overall and stratified according to sleep quality. The mean age of the participants was 48.8 ± 7.6 years, without significant differences between groups, and the majority were males (94%).",7a341cd1-cab5-41ca-9700-8a2904af9f14

Bad sleepers on average had higher body weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), as well as body fat (all p<0.01) than good sleepers, but did not have significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( Table 2 ). In addition, bad sleepers had a higher prevalence of obesity (p<0.001), abdominal obesity (p<0.001) and hypertension (p<0.01), compared with good sleepers ( Table 2 ).

4,results5," On the other hand, firefighters reporting short sleep at firehouses had differences in anthropometric measures and blood pressures compared to those with normal sleep duration, but these differences were not significant (data not shown). Finally, firefighters reporting short sleep in a 24-hours period including naps, had higher weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.05) and a higher prevalence of hypertension (p<0.01) ( Supplementary Table 2 ). In addition, for firefighters reporting short sleep at the firehouse (n=204) we performed additional analysis to compare whose firefighters reporting short sleep at the firehouse and home (n=77, 37.7%) with firefighters reporting short sleep at the firehouse but usual sleep at home (n=127, 62.3%) recovery sleep. Firefighters reporting recovery sleep had lower body fat (p<0.01), body mass index (BMI) (p 0.03) and prevalence of hypertension (p 0.046) and obesity (p 0.016) ( Table 4 ).",c8d2d7da-dff4-4c57-ba31-ca7ab771abc7

Similar results were found for participants who slept ≤6 hours per night at home for having hypertension (OR=1.88, 95% CI: 1.02-3.46) or abdominal obesity (OR=1.67, 95% CI: 0.92-3.05) and for being obese (OR=1.14, 95% CI: 0.58-2.21) after adjustment for the same covariates as compared to firefighters who slept >6 hours per night.

6,discussion0," Our results suggest that both the quality and quantity of sleep were associated with cardiometabolic risk among Indiana firefighters in the Feeding America’s Bravest cohort. Specifically, we found that bad sleepers had higher weight, waist circumference, body fat and body mass index (BMI) compared with the good sleepers and additionally had a higher prevalence of hypertension and obesity. In addition, those participants who slept 6 or less hours per night at home had higher weight, body mass index (BMI) and hypertension prevalence compared with those who slept more than 6 hours per night. This study provides additional evidence supporting that the quality and quantity of sleep are likely important modifiable cardiometabolic risk factors among firefighters.  Our study is consistent with and expands previous results in firefighters and other shift workers. Shift work has been previously linked with poor quality of sleep and short sleep duration (23, 24). Barger et al.",3c1b337e-3b2f-44a8-859b-b44e130bb0ff
7,discussion1," found an association in firefighters between likely sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)) and insomnia and health outcomes including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression or anxiety (7). Similarly, Rajaratnam et al. demonstrated analogous associations in a large cohort of police officers (13). In addition, Liu Q et al. found that shift workers were found to have a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity in a meta-analysis including 311,344 participants (25). Similarly, Chang JH et al. found an association between sleep duration and sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and Metabolic Syndrome (MS) in a police officer cohort (26). Therefore, evidence suggests that participants with sleep disturbances may be predisposed to a greater risk of cardiovascular events (27, 28).  Globally, insufficient sleep is considered to be a public health epidemic with serious health implications (29).",af129ead-cd85-4fba-8e1c-400dd59005b8
8,discussion2," Nocturnal exposure to light among shift workers along with irregular meal timing has been demonstrated to be important factors driving circadian disruption (30).  The relationship between circadian disruption and obesity is well established (31). The circadian system is responsible for synchronizing energy homeostasis with the day-night cycle as other biological processes are critical for the control of body weight and for general metabolic health (32). In our study, we demonstrated that firefighters with sleep disturbance (quality or quantity) had higher body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and obesity. Many studies support this relation noting the importance of the short sleep duration stimulates hunger and appetite probably through hormonal mechanisms (33).  With respect to hypertension, we showed that it is associated with poorer quality sleep and insufficient sleep (defined as those who slept less than 6 hours).",50710e0c-dc1d-43ce-9458-744c682b8ae6
9,discussion3," Over the diurnal cycle, blood pressure is regulated by the circadian system and disruption of this system has been linked with a higher prevalence of hypertension (34).  Additionally, poor sleep status and sleep disorders are linked with lower productivity at work and a greater risk of accidents (29). Therefore, sleep improvement programs providing sleep health education and sleep disorders screenings can likely reduce injuries and disability among firefighters (35).  Barger et al. found that among almost 7,000 US firefighters undergoing sleep disorders screening, the risk of several adverse health and safety outcomes was elevated in those firefighters screening positive for a sleep disorder (7). Nonetheless, future longitudinal studies are needed to demonstrate causation, or if sleep health interventions can reduce future Cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.  Limitations of this study included the self-reported information from a lifestyle questionnaire that included sleep quality.",108d14db-1053-4c87-8459-035e45a6701e
10,discussion4," In addition, the cross-sectional study design limits our ability to establish causal relationships, however there are plausible biologic mechanisms that support the associations found. In addition, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep disorder among firefighters and is associated with obesity and hypertension. This could explain some of the associations we found but is also consistent with sleep disruption being associated with increased Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Our sleep quality index has not been validated. Additionally, the generalizability of our findings could be limited because we studied firefighters from a single state. The main strength of the current work was the independent objective assessments of the outcome measures.  Our results showed that poor sleep quality and sleep quantity were both associated with more adverse cardiometabolic risk profiles among career firefighters.",833e8236-c68e-4b02-bba7-8708d746b270
