Design and Setting  We carried out an observational cross-sectional study from December 2016 to January 2021 at the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Unit of Endocrinology, University Federico II, Naples (Italy). The Ethical Committee “Federico II” approved this study (n. 173/16), which was carried out following the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for clinical studies. All study participants, after being informed of the purpose and procedures, provided informed consent.  2.2. Population Study  Two hundred forty-seven Caucasian adult subjects aged between 20 and 68 years of both sexes were consecutively enrolled in the same urban area in Naples in Italy among patients of our clinic, volunteers, hospital employees, and participants in the Obesity, Programs of nutrition, Education, Research and Assessment of the best treatment (of the best treatment (OPERA)) project [22].",adb305bd-9e0e-403d-bf0b-e39f876ad141

10,methods10," In addition, a logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between chronotype score and circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations above the median (6.80 µM). A restricted cubic spline analysis was performed to smooth the nonlinear relationship between chronotype score predictive of circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations and predict the factor levels that explain the pattern of linear correlation within variables. A separate curve was fit to each segment. The location of the knots was set according to the three categories of the chronotype: evening (16–41), neither (42–58), and morning (59–86) chronotype [6].  3. Results  The study population consisted of 247 participants, 147 females (49.5%) and 100 males (40.5%), aged 20–68 years.

13,methods13," Participants with the morning chronotype followed a healthier lifestyle; in particular, they performed more regular physical activity (p = 0.006) and most of them were non-smokers (p = 0.004). Subjects with the morning chronotype had the lowest body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001), WC (p < 0.001), PAS (p = 0.013), and the best metabolic profile compared to subjects with the other chronotypes. In addition, subjects with the morning chronotype had the highest Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MD score (p < 0.001), with the highest percentage of subjects with higher adherence to the MD (p < 0.001), as shown in Table 3.  Figure 1 reports circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations across the chronotype categories.

All parameters evaluated in this study were significantly associated with both circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations and chronotype.  The correlation between circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations and the chronotype score was still evident (p < 0.001) after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MD score (Figure 2).",ae7debd6-4efe-4366-84ad-b504b2916a85

Both circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations and the chronotype score were significantly associated with sex (p < 0.001), smoking (p < 0.001), and physical activity (p < 0.001). In addition, the highest circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations were associated with the lowest adherence to the MD (OR 1.53, p < 0.001) and the evening chronotype (OR 2.31, p < 0.001). Likewise, the lowest chronotype score was associated with the lowest adherence to the MD (OR 0.95, p < 0.001) (Table 5).",37055504-6934-43aa-8dfe-d2290516cced
16,methods16,"  We performed a linear regression model to evaluate the association between circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations and the chronotype score, adjusting for potential confounders including age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, physical activity, smoking, and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MD score. In this model, the chronotype score was strongly associated with circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations (β = −0.479, t = −12.08, and p < 0.001). Results are reported in Table 6.  A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between the chronotype score and circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations above the median (6.80 µM).

A restricted cubic spline analysis was then used to obtain the range of values of the chronotype score that split up with knots (evening, neither, and morning chronotype) defining the relationship with circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations at the end of one segment and the start of the next. In particular, a chronotype score ≥59 (p < 0.001, estimator = −0.0037, standard error = 0.0004, R2 = −0.824) demonstrated a more significant inverse linear relationship with circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations compared with knots <59 (neither chronotype) and <41 (evening chronotype); Figure 3.  4.",d84a2014-7a43-429f-8969-65dc89ea30b3
18,methods18," Discussion  In this cross-sectional observational study, we investigated circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations, a gut-derived metabolite that has proven to be a marker of gut dysbiosis, and cardiometabolic risk in three different chronotypes (morning, evening, and neither) according to sex, lifestyle habits, body mass index (BMI), and adherence to the MD. The morning chronotype was observed in 62.3% of the subjects and was associated with the lowest anthropometric measurements, the better metabolic profile, and the higher adherence to the MD compared to intermediate and evening chronotypes. In addition, the highest percentage of morning chronotype was present in women, non-smokers, and physically active subjects.",1562e33c-c5f4-4bbf-b301-59304f3b2008
19,methods19," Stratifying the sample population according to the three chronotype categories, circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations decreased significantly along with the chronotype score, with the lowest values in the subjects with the morning chronotype category. As expected, while circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations were positively correlated with altered anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, metabolic profile, and lower Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MD score, the chronotype score was inversely correlated with those variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that reported a significant inverse correlation between circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations and the chronotype score, independently of common potential confounding covariates, such as anthropometric measurements and adherence to the MD.",6ed3869a-d737-4e1b-a61c-731d6668e14d
20,methods20," In particular, lower chronotype scores were mostly associated with higher circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations. Finally, using a restricted cubic spline analysis, we found that the morning chronotype demonstrated a more significant inverse linear relationship with circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations compared with neither and evening chronotypes.  Chronotype can be defined as an attitude of behavioral preference for eveningness or morningness, or an individual measurement based on the timing of reported behaviors related to the sleep–wake cycle [46]. On the other side, in a given population, both genetic and environmental factors, including diet and gut microbiota, influence the distribution of chronotypes [2,46,47,48].",2e6d4d94-6e7a-4fb7-a992-700ea2ac1d75
21,methods21," In particular, subjects with the evening chronotype are often chronically affected by misalignment in biological rhythms and irregular sleep and wake-up patterns, with a preference for nocturnal activities [49]; these conditions may increase, in the long term, the levels of both oxidative stress and chronic inflammation and alter the intestinal microbiota, thus increasing the risk of chronic diseases [50]. Consistently, a growing amount of evidence indicates that the evening chronotype is associated with chronic non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, metabolic syndrome [7,51,52], and gut dysbiosis [2,46,47,48]. Lately, the role of the circadian rhythm in the regulation of the gastrointestinal tract has been gaining a lot of interest [53]. Of interest, Nojkov et al. [54] reported that circadian alterations associated with shift work can lead to an increased incidence of diseases of the digestive system.",2f13cdfa-21c2-4649-86ae-3241f4bd0601
22,methods22,"  Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) is a gut-derived metabolite depending on the function of the intestinal barrier, which is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and mortality [55]. Besides the gut microbiota, circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations are determined by many factors, such as age, gender, and dietary nutrients [15]. We previously reported that the circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations were negatively associated with a healthy dietary pattern, such as MD and 25-OH vitamin D levels [35,36]. In addition, we also found that the circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations represented an early biomarker of adipose dysfunction and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [36].",925b12e4-53d5-4fda-9de0-e4abae96778f
23,methods23," In this context, the present study further increased the knowledge on the link between circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations and the adherence to the MD, as we evidenced that higher circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations were associated with an unhealthy lifestyle expressed not only by the low adherence to the MD, but also by the evening chronotype, a trait that best expresses the individual circadian preference in behavioral and biological rhythms and that has been previously associated with gut dysbiosis [2,10,46,47,48].  In line with our findings, it is well described that the low chronotype score, characterized by the evening chronotype on the one side, and higher circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations on the other side, is associated with an unhealthy metabolic profile, gut dysbiosis, and higher cardiovascular risk [7,56,57,58].",c224f735-49dd-4b5f-86c5-3366436c8f8c
24,methods24," Thus, it is tempting to speculate on the association between the evening chronotype and gut dysbiosis, and the increased circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations, as the product of the oxygenation of Trimethylamine (TMA), might represent a biomarker of the increased intestinal translocation of Trimethylamine (TMA) linked to gut dysbiosis and the altered intestinal barrier.  As a potential translational application, this study suggests that the association between evening chronotype and high circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations might potentiate the cardiometabolic risk. The possible bidirectional relationship between chronotype score and circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations has been resumed in Figure 4.  This association might be of strategic utility considering that a dose–response meta-analysis of clinical studies indicated that the risk of all-cause mortality increased by 7.",3619a047-0e00-4e3e-9950-d0f04db4dece

Nevertheless, it should be considered that the 19-item MEQ chronotype questionnaire is easy to administer and to analyze, while the detection of circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations requires venous sampling and dedicated laboratory facilities.  The main limitation of this study is that the cross-sectional design does not allow us to identify any causal associations between the variables analyzed. Therefore, we cannot establish the prognostic value of the chronotype score for predicting circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations. Secondly, we did not include in this study the metagenome analysis to explore gut microbiota dysbiosis in subjects with different chronotypes closely.",31c91a76-3aeb-4b8d-90b5-866676c427d9
26,methods26," However, it is well known that the very changeable composition of the gut microbiota might potentially hinder the robustness and reproducibility of microbiota—disease associative studies [20,60,61,62]. In addition, circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations have recently been included among the reliable biomarkers for gut dysbiosis [17]. A further limitation was that we did not include other metabolites involved in the same pathway of Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O), such as carnitine, betaine, or choline. Nevertheless, the relationships between circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations and chronic non-communicable diseases were also independent of choline or other metabolites [63,64,65]. A further issue could arise from the use of the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire in an Italian sample population.",49742dc1-aed1-4e0c-bad4-ee2db31dd369
27,methods27," The 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire was previously validated for the Spanish population in the PREvencion con DIetaMEDiterranea (PREDIMED) study. Nevertheless, the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire has been widely applied as a suitable tool for identifying the dietary habits of a population different from the Spanish one in several other countries around the world. In particular, very recently the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire was simultaneously validated by García-Conesa, M.T. et al. (2020) [66] in different Mediterranean countries, including Italy.",bc79d8ce-bec6-426b-afc9-973bd58e77b1
28,methods28," The results of this study supported a general fair-to-moderate concordance for many of the food items of the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire principally in several Southern European countries around the Mediterranean area, thus pointing out the validity of this questionnaire as a rapid and flexible tool to evaluate the adherence to the MD. Finally, although the influence of chronotype upon sleep behavior is well recognized, we did not evaluate sleep quality in this study.  A major strength of this cross-sectional study is the strong characterization of our sample population, with the exclusion of conditions that can alter the metabolism of Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O), such as type 2 diabetes and impaired kidney function. In addition, the single-center study allowed us to increase the homogeneity of the sample.",6129d05b-d772-48bb-9c3a-e5aa061fe638
29,methods29," Furthermore, we included a variety of potential covariates, such as adherence to the MD, anthropometric measurements and lifestyle, to limit the effect of confounding factors on the association of circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations with the chronotypes. A further strength was the assessment of circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations in plasma samples rather than in urine ones. Circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations are largely dependent upon dietary intake and urinary excretion, with an overlap in distribution among both healthy and diseased populations [67]. However, Krüger et al.",3b6c699a-ecc6-4ea7-89f6-68f360b28946
30,methods30," [68] reported that although Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations in plasma and urine might be differentially affected depending on the food source, the current fish consumption, one of the items included in the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MD score, affected more urinary than plasma Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O). In addition, the chronotype questionnaire was evaluated using a validated questionnaire, the 19-item MEQ questionnaire [6]. In particular, this questionnaire is poorly time demanding, requires poor collaboration from individuals, and provides a clear result to the interviewees immediately after finishing the questionnaire. Moreover, the MEQ questionnaire is not self-reported as it is face-to-face, administered by only one expert nutritionist to limit any bias regarding proper completion of the questionnaire and to avoid inter-operator variability.  5.",f4bc9b45-8a48-4026-8e96-d881ebe6339a
31,methods31," Conclusions  In summary, the current study presented the first evidence that high circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations were associated with an unhealthy lifestyle expressed not only by low adherence to the MD, but also by the evening chronotype, a trait that best expresses the individual circadian preference in behavioral and biological rhythms. Our results support the evidence that that the evaluation of the chronotype should be included in the management of patients in a nutrition and dietetics clinic by a qualified nutritionist. This allows speculation on the plausible positive and cost-effective effects of carrying out dietary interventions according to the chronotype as support for clinical trials aiming to reduce circulating Trimethylamine N Oxide (Trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations, and consequently, cardiometabolic risk.
