0,introduction0,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)), characterized by increased fat accumulation in the hepatocytes of the liver parenchyma, is today one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease worldwide (1–4). non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 20%–40% of population in Western countries and 5%–40% of general populations in Asia-Pacific region (5). The increasing prevalence of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) parallels the rise of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and components of the metabolic syndrome, particularly insulin resistance (5–8). Development of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered to be through a “two hit” process. The first “hit” includes excessive fat accumulation in liver cells and insulin resistance. Oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines play roles in the second “hit” (5, 9).",de109756-7be0-4ddb-87ff-ffe41ed8e4e7
1,introduction1,"  The disease encompasses a wide spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)), which can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatic carcinoma (5, 7, 10). Moreover, non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease (6, 11). Diet has a key role in the development of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Genetic and positive energy balance have important impacts on the first “hit” and diet composition affects the second “hit” and the severity of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (8, 12, 13) emphasizing the criticality of management and control of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  Several studies have reported that excessive consumption of carbohydrates, especially refined carbohydrates, fats, saturated fats in particular, and protein from meat can cause non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (14–18).",62e150f2-c6e3-47bb-a0e6-f223608e493e
2,introduction2," Besides, higher intakes of soft drinks and meat are associated with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adults (14). To date lifestyle changes and dietary modifications are the main established treatment guidelines for non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (3, 4, 19, 20). Lifestyle modifications involve weight loss and increasing physical activity (3, 8, 21). Weight loss by following a calorie-restricted diet and increasing physical activity can improve steatosis, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risk and reduce hepatic inflammation and hepatocellular injury (2–4, 21). Moreover, all patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are advised to adhere to several dietary recommendations such as avoiding simple carbohydrates, saturated fats, and sweetened drinks and consuming diets rich in fruits and vegetables (3, 4, 13).",d938ec82-9c70-41cf-8cad-74faf9f706cf
3,introduction3,"  Although there are studies examined the relationship between non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and food intakes, no systematic review has been conducted to summarize the findings. Thus, the objective of this study was to review systematically observational studies available on the relationship between food groups, dietary patterns, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Intakes of red meat, fats, and sweets were high whereas consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables were less in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Moreover, there was a positive association between the Western dietary pattern and the risk of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), while adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly associated with the severity of hepatic steatosis.  Conclusion: Generally, different food group intakes and dietary patterns are associated with the progression of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its risk factors. Because of the many limitations of available studies reviewed on this topic, more prospective studies are suggested.",971b5e4d-b04f-424b-9a98-4e5fa7ffc220

The results of our review suggest that there are relationships between various food groups intake, diets, and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) but not clear and conclusive ones and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients consume difference amounts of various food groups. The reasons for these differences and uncertainties are different study designs (12, 23–26), small sample size (12, 25, 27), no control of confounder variables such as anthropometric factors and socioeconomic status (23, 25–27), the diagnostic method of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (12, 23, 25–27), bias caused by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (12, 23, 24, 26) and no control group or unhealthy controls (23–25, 27). Therefore, it is necessary to give special attention to these factors in future studies in this field.",4abfc7e7-2e40-4238-97d8-9bd2e962e673
32,discussion1,"  We can discuss the relationship between diet and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in different perspectives. Some of them studied the association between food group in-takes and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Red meat and its products, fats and oils and sugars and sweets intake were higher and whole grains, fruits and vegetables intake were lower in the patients than in the controls or recommended amounts. Generally, review of studies has shown dairy consumption can reduce the risk of obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, diabetes and hypertension, which are non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk factors (29, 30). However, the results of included articles in this review were inconsistent because their quality was influenced by some major limitations like different study design (23, 24, 26), no control group (24) or obese participants (23, 26). Therefore, more prospective studies are needed in this field.",e01ae5e6-69c1-4112-98ed-eb38bd172f4a
33,discussion2,"  In most of the reviewed studies, fruits and vegetables consumption were lower in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients compared with healthy subjects or recommended amounts. The protective effects of high intake of fruits and vegetables on non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevention are due to a high content of fiber, phytochemicals, and antioxidants in these food groups. Phytochemicals and antioxidants are anti-inflammatory compounds and can prevent developing hepatic steatosis. Moreover, fiber plays an important role in maintaining blood glucose, insulin and free fatty acids at a constant level, in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (31, 32). This result can be the best explain for the reason of lower hepatic steatosis in individuals who adhere to the Mediterranean diet because there are high amounts of fruits and vegetables in this dietary pattern (12, 33, 34).",c5f86de4-970b-4711-8771-e8ae8de126a9
34,discussion3,"  Moreover, most of the studies in this systematic review showed higher consumption of red meat in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Saturated fatty acids in red meat increase trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid in liver cells (35) and so can promote endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis (36), involved in the pathogenesis of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  Some other studies in this review, evaluated the association between diet and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, from the perspective of dietary patterns (12, 28). Review of these studies showed the Western dietary pattern was prospectively associated with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",fa94d0cf-ff66-4cb2-ab36-baef552eb154
35,discussion4," In fact, common foods in the Western dietary pattern including processed sugars and fat, white bread, refined grains, soft drinks, and confectionary, by provision of excess calories and large amounts of sugars such as fructose, can cause rapidly increased postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels. (28, 37–39). Several studies showed a significant association between the Western dietary pattern and obesity (40, 41). Obese individuals were followed a Western dietary pattern had a greater rate of de novo lipogenesis, one of the causes of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), compared with lean subjects when fed the same diet (42).. Based on these findings and other studies regarding the pathogenesis and risk factors of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and different dietary patterns (43–52) we can suggest Fig. 2.  Fig. 2: Effects of western and healthy dietary patterns on the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a.",af1be320-ebd8-4024-8f5c-0930c83c1aa4
36,discussion5," western dietary pattern can cause non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through several ways: 1) by ↑ HODE (hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids), HETE (hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids), TBARS (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) and oxidized LDL (lipid oxidation products), so increase in oxidative stress, 2) by ↑ inflammation mediated by Kupffer cells and TNF-α, and 3) by alteration in secretion of adipokines from fat tissues for example: reduction in adiponectin and increase in leptin, TNF-α, interleukin-6 and resisting. b.",5dcd103d-827e-4690-8f52-674fc2ac8bba
37,discussion6," Healthy dietary pattern can provide protection towards development of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through: 1)by effect on pancreas and so decrease in postprandial insulin responses and increase in insulin sensitivity, 2) by affecting the growth of gut bacteria (suppression in the growth of pathogenic bacteria and stimulation in beneficial ones)leading to↓ FFA uptake in Liver/adipose tissue, ↓ lipogenesis, ↓ gluconeogenesis, ↓ energy harvest from diet, ↑ VLDL secretion from liver and ↓ liver inflammation, and 3)by ↓ Kupffer cells, TNF-α and CRP and so reduction in inflammation.  Review of the studies (12, 53, 54) also showed adherence to the Mediterranean diet because of the high content of fruits and vegetables, is inversely associated with insulin resistance. Moreover, this diet can provide protective effects on metabolic syndrome and its components and improves insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (55).",8acd5ef5-b44b-42b3-8192-21ba0f752cd7
38,discussion7,"  The third category of included studies in the review examined the association between dietary quality indices and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (25). To determine these indices, researchers assess the total intakes of all food groups and then compare them with standard recommended amounts. dietary indices (Dietary Energy Density (DED), Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR), and Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) could be appropriate indicators to assess the dietary quality in them.",d7f162f6-7922-4c03-ab31-d715c5ab2340
39,discussion8," The observed score of these indices among non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, lower score of Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) and Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR) and higher score of dietary indices (Dietary Energy Density (DED), are reasonable because the non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients consume lower fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fiber and antioxidants and higher carbohydrate, especially simple carbohydrate, refined grains, and unsuitable fat (17, 18, 33, 56).  The remarkable point in this regard is the importance of non-dietary factors, particularly genetic, in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (55). Positive energy balance, involved in the first hit of the disease, has different effects in different individuals. This issue is also supported by studies indicating different likelihood of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among different races (57).",b686ed6a-303e-41dc-abf1-c66d53951a4d
40,discussion9," In fact, these non-dietary factors may be responsible for some of the inconsistent findings regarding the role of diet composition in the pathogenesis and development of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (12).  Conclusion Different food group intakes and dietary patterns are associated with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its risk factors such as obesity, glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. However, the generalizability of these results is limited because the design of the most of reviewed studies was cross-sectional or case-control which cannot establish causal relations. Therefore, we suggest doing more prospective studies in future to clarify these associations in a prospective view.
