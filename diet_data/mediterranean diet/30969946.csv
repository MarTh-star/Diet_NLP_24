0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design The present work is part of the MIMobstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (Mediterranean diet/lifestyle Intervention for the Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnea) study, a 12-month, single-center, single-blind, parallel-group (1:1), randomized, controlled, superiority clinical trial. The MIMobstructive sleep apnea (OSA) study was designed to test the hypothesis that the combination of a weight-loss Mediterranean diet/lifestyle intervention and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) standard care can yield greater improvements in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity, symptomatology and patients’ cardiometabolic profile compared to standard care alone, and that a Mediterranean lifestyle intervention can lead to additional benefits for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients compared to an intervention based solely on the Mediterranean diet.",3c46cef9-9131-46f6-93ae-1d077d8f4b20
1,methods1," The MIMobstructive sleep apnea (OSA) study was approved by the Scientific Board of Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece and the Bioethics Committee of Harokopio University, Athens, Greece, was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [16] and is registered in the National Institutes of Health database (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02515357).  2.2. Participants Potential candidates for the study were recruited from the Center of Sleep Disorders of “Evangelismos” Hospital. All adult individuals who visited the center and had a clinical suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were subjected to an attended overnight polysomnography (polysomnography (PSG)), and those with a definite diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were referred to the research dietitian for further screening.",7f549349-78c4-485d-82e5-560ed698b4c1
2,methods2," During screening, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were taken from all patients and self-reported data were collected on demographic parameters, medical history, medication use, smoking and alcohol drinking. Candidates were considered eligible for participation in the study if they were adult (18–65 years old), overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2) and had moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (apnea hypopnea index (and had moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (apnea hypopnea index (AHI)) ≥ 15 events/h of sleep).",7f579016-d553-4683-a92d-ab4829b2922e
3,methods3," Candidates were excluded on the basis of the following: (a) presence of central sleep apnea or other sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome and chronic pain syndrome; (b) presence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, familial dyslipidemia, severe uncontrolled hypertension (systolic/diastolic blood pressure > 160/95 mm Hg), chronic kidney disease, malignancy, inflammatory diseases and psychiatric disorders; (c) hospitalization due to acute or chronic respiratory disease or required use of supplemental oxygen during the last year; (d) any kind of surgery during the last three months; (e) pregnancy or breast-feeding for women; (f) use of antipsychotic, antidepressant and other hypnotic drugs, systematic use of steroids or hormone replacement therapy for women; (g) habitual excessive alcohol intake (>210 and >140 g of alcohol per week for men and women,",576a7971-1d16-4885-8bd6-04095c19d22e
4,methods4," respectively); and (h) currently on a weight-loss diet or recent change in lifestyle habits. Eligible candidates were informed in detail about the aims and procedures of the study and were asked to willingly provide a signed written consent form for participation.  2.3. Randomization Enrolled patients were blindly randomized to one of the three study groups, i.e., a standard care group (standard care group (SCG)) or one of the two intervention arms: a Mediterranean diet group (Mediterranean diet group (MDG)) and a Mediterranean lifestyle group (Mediterranean lifestyle group (MLG)).",9df31a27-aa60-4104-9eb0-bd9cdc2c3ffa
5,methods5," Randomization was based on a restricted minimization approach [17], according to which the first patient was randomly allocated to one of the three study groups using a computerized random number generator and each subsequent patient was sequentially assigned to a particular study group by taking into account previous assignments of participants and specific covariates, namely participants’ age, sex, BMI and and had moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (apnea hypopnea index (AHI) levels, in order to minimize baseline between-group imbalances and ensure valid treatment comparisons. The research dietitian was solely responsible for the assignment of participants to interventions, while all other study team members were blinded to patients’ allocation to study groups.  2.4. Interventions After randomization, all three study groups received standard care for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) management.",5b1d76db-cd79-4ea9-9fee-3472cc988f58
6,methods6," Specifically, after the initial polysomnography (PSG) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis, all enrolled participants were subjected to an overnight, in-laboratory continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration sleep study according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)) guidelines [18] and were accordingly prescribed with the same auto-continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device on the basis of current recommendations for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) management [6]. Patients were given detailed information on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) acquisition, use and maintenance and were instructed to use it daily during night sleep for the whole study period.",575771a3-dfe9-4d93-93b4-078f93d70ea8
7,methods7," In the context of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) standard care, patients were also able to monitor continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) performance and receive reinforcement on optimal use and adherence at bimonthly prescheduled appointments with members of the medical team of the Center of Sleep Disorders. To evaluate compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, patients were asked to record the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) based on device reports in self-monitoring print forms throughout the six-month intervention period.  On top of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prescription, the standard care group (SCG) received brief written advice for a healthy lifestyle and an indicative hypocaloric daily dietary plan, i.e., 7531 kJ (1800 kcal) for men and 6276 kJ (1500 kcal) for women, without any other intervention until the end of the six-month study period.",19541014-2a13-4726-a307-d3c0d2fcba97
8,methods8," Patients in the Mediterranean diet group (MDG) and the Mediterranean lifestyle group (MLG) participated in an intensive six-month intervention led by the research dietitian that consisted of seven 60-min group (3–5 patients) counselling sessions, held biweekly for the first two months and monthly for the next four months at the laboratory of Clinical Nutrition & Dietetics of Harokopio University. Group sessions were scheduled based on participants’ availability. When an emergency prevented participants from attending a session, they were given the opportunity to reschedule or receive all relevant information through the telephone or an e-meeting with the research dietitian. The intervention was based on cognitive behavioral therapy and several techniques, such as goal setting, problem solving, assessment of readiness and self-efficacy for change, self-monitoring, stimulus control and relapse prevention, were used to facilitate behavior change [19,20,21].",e703cd42-af55-4ab7-a64e-38a79e4d5420
9,methods9," The two principal goals for intervention arms were a 5–10% weight loss and an increase in the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, i.e., a dietary pattern characterized by high consumption of olive oil, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fruits and nuts, moderate consumption of poultry, fish and dairy products, low consumption of red meat products and sweets, and low-to-moderate consumption of wine as the main source of alcohol accompanying main meals (Supplemental Results Table S1) [22].",c93d98d2-7c8c-4f19-8d58-0533bd283ec8
10,methods10," Briefly, the first session was devoted to weight loss; participants received the same indicative hypocaloric dietary plan as the standard care group (SCG) that served as an example of a balanced diet, and counselling emphasized on dietary practices that can help reduce energy intake, such as the adoption of a balanced daily meal pattern, the avoidance of energy-dense snacks and nibbling, the correct identification of hunger and satiety, the limitation of social overeating and emotional eating, food portion control and the establishment of proper meal conditions (sitting at the table, family or social meals, eating without parallel activities like TV, etc.) In the following six sessions, patients were gradually trained to adopt the Mediterranean diet [22]. In each session, patients were informed about the nutritional value and health effects of specific food groups and were given goals about their recommended consumption frequency and quantity according to the Mediterranean pattern.",830e7fee-d135-460c-b73f-64485f186e46
11,methods11," Other healthy dietary practices, such as ensuring a nutritional variety, choosing unprocessed, traditional, local and seasonal foods, as well as implementing healthy cooking techniques, were also addressed.  Patients in the Mediterranean lifestyle group (MLG) received the same dietary intervention but were given additional goals for increasing physical activity and achieving an optimal sleep duration and quality. With regard to physical activity, patients were instructed to participate in any kind of aerobic moderate-intensity physical activity (e.g., fast-paced walking, taking the stairs, recreational cycling, recreational swimming, running, dancing or any kind of sports) for ≥150 min/week with emphasis on outdoor and convivial activities than can be maintained in the long term, and to reduce the amount of time spent in sedentary activities (e.g., screen time) to less than 2 h/day, according to the World Health Organization guidelines [23].",2163fdc4-0827-4917-8d36-21691054ea1a
12,methods12," To enhance motivation, patients were also given pedometers and were asked to record their total daily steps, aiming at a gradual increase with the ultimate goal of 10,000 steps/day. With regard to sleep habits, patients were instructed to achieve an optimal sleep duration, i.e., 7–9 h/day, as recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) [24], and to adopt the traditional Mediterranean mid-day rest (siesta). Education on sleep hygiene was also provided to improve patients’ sleep quality, including guidance on maintaining a steady sleep schedule, ensuring a proper sleep environment, avoiding caffeine, alcohol and foods that can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms before bedtime, as well as avoiding sleeping in the supine position that can aggravate respiratory events.  2.5. Assessments Participants were evaluated in terms of anthropometric parameters, lifestyle habits and cardiometabolic indices both pre- (baseline) and post-intervention (six months).",e31b5c9a-94c6-4889-a365-eb8697a0c8a9
13,methods13,"  Body weight and height were measured following standard procedures. Waist circumference (WC) was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm between the lowest rib and the superior border of the iliac crest at the end of normal expiration, using a non-elastic measuring tape positioned parallel to the floor and with the subject standing. Dietary habits were assessed through a validated, 76-item, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire [25], based on which dietary intake was expressed in terms of daily food group (e.g., dairy products, fruits, vegetables) and individual food and beverage (e.g., potatoes, olive oil, coffee) consumption. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MedDietScore) [26] was used to evaluate participants’ level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (range: 0–55; higher values indicate a greater adherence). In addition, two non-consecutive, 24-h dietary recalls were performed both pre- and post-intervention to assess participants’ energy, macronutrient and micronutrient intake.",bc5f1eff-c92d-4838-afc9-3b3c3955407f
14,methods14," The first recall was performed in a face-to-face interview at the time of the patients’ assessment, while the second one was performed via telephone within seven days. Dietary recalls were obtained using the three-pass approach [27]. To facilitate an accurate portion size evaluation, patients were asked to report quantities of individual foods and beverages consumed in typical household objects (e.g., teaspoons, tablespoons, cups, etc.) and other commonly known items and sizes (e.g., matchbox, cell phone, palm, etc.). For complex food recipes and when common measures were not helpful, a booklet with multiple photos of different portion sizes for several food items was used and patients were asked to indicate their portion size based on the available photos. Each dietary recall was analyzed using Nutritionist ProTM (Axxya Systems, Stafford, TX, USA) [28] and the average of the two recalls was used to report participants’ energy intake.",2eba0423-0e98-44e6-841b-1346f29be3cf
15,methods15," Physical activity level was assessed through the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire [29], based on which, mean daily time (min/day) spent in any kind of physical activity (walking, medium and high intensity activities) was calculated for each participant. Average night-time sleep duration (h/day) was self-reported by participants.  With regard to the assessment of patients’ cardiometabolic profile, fasting blood samples (12 h) were collected post-polysomnography (PSG) and plasma aliquots were immediately frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC)) were measured by enzymatic colorimetric assay (COBAS® 8000 analyzer; Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC)) was calculated using the Friedewald formula [30].",809ad64a-d99c-428c-bba0-0aa04d3d515d
16,methods16," Non-HDL cholesterol (nhigh density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC)) (determined as TC minus high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC)), as well as the ratios of TC/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and TG/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), were also calculated. Insulin levels were determined by the chemiluminescence method (E170 modular analyzer; Roche) and the homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated according to Matthews et al. [31]. Liver enzymes, i.e., alanine transferase (alanine transferase (ALT)), aspartate transferase (aspartate transferase (AST)) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)), were measured by enzymatic colorimetric method (COBAS® 8000 analyzer). Participants’ blood pressures were also measured with an automatic blood pressure monitor operating on the oscillometric principle (OMRON HEM-7130) according to a standardized protocol [32].",44a09754-02b1-430e-a254-adadd93830d8
17,methods17," All measurements were performed in the left arm, after a 12-h fast and at least a 30-min period without smoking or engaging in any kind of physical activity. After a 5-min rest, the device was used to take two blood pressure measurements separated by a 2-min interval, and their average was used for analyses.  The presence of MS was defined as the coexistence of ≥3 of the five following components, according to the criteria proposed by Alberti et al. [33]: (a) increased WC, i.e., >102 cm for males and >88 cm for females; (b) increased fasting glucose levels, i.e., ≥5.6 mmol/L (≥100 mg/dL) or reception of antidiabetic medication (presence of diabetes mellitus was an exclusion criterion); (c) decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels, i.e., <1.0 mmol/L (<40 mg/dL) for males and <1.3 mmol/L (<50 mg/dL) for females, or reception of relevant medication; (d) increased TG levels ≥1.7 mmol/L (≥150 mg/dL) or reception of lipid-lowering medication; (e) hypertension, i.e.",99263c7b-0976-494c-be9b-c54612d4b2e3
18,methods18,", systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) ≥130 mm Hg or/and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) ≥85 mm Hg, or reception of antihypertensive medication.  2.6. Statistical Analysis The primary endpoint was the prevalence of MS, while secondary endpoints included the prevalence of individual MS components and patients’ cardiometabolic profile indices, i.e., glucose metabolism parameters, lipidemic profile indices, liver enzymes and blood pressure levels. The MIMobstructive sleep apnea (OSA) study was designed and powered to detect post-intervention between-group differences in the and had moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (apnea hypopnea index (AHI) as the primary study endpoint.",2f06d289-6e5e-4706-85dd-d7dbe90f0ef6
19,methods19," However, the target sample size (n = 180) was also sufficient to obtain at least 70% power to detect a significant difference in the prevalence of MS between intervention groups and the standard care group (SCG) at the end of the study allowing for a type-I error rate of 0.05, assuming a 50–70% prevalence of the MS in the total study sample at baseline [34] and a post-intervention decrease of 20–30% in intervention arms on the basis of previous reports [35].  Primary analyses were performed with the intention to treat approach. Missing values were predicted using estimating-equation methods, which involved fitting a statistical model to the observed data with the use of missing-at-random method [36]. A complete-case analysis was also performed in the per protocol population. All analyses were performed using the SPSS version 23.0 (IBM Corp. 2015, Aemonk, NY, USA). The normality of data was assessed through the Shapiro–Wilk test.",0ecb9ba4-7b37-49c5-a55d-6d379d95bca7
20,methods20," Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation for normally distributed numerical variables or median (1st, 3rd quartile) for skewed numerical variables, and as absolute number (relative frequency) for categorical variables. Within-group changes were tested through paired samples t-test for normally distributed numerical variables or Wilcoxon signed-rank test for skewed numerical variables and McNemar’s test for categorical variables. Between-group differences were tested through analysis of covariance for numerical variables (skewed variables were log transformed and are presented in their anti-logarithm form) and generalized linear models (binomial distribution with logit link function) for categorical variables. The Bonferroni correction [37] was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results are presented as adjusted mean difference and relative risk with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), respectively.",f40551a8-8666-4733-ab04-da43a8e83bc7
21,methods21," Participants’ age, sex, baseline levels of the dependent variables and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use (h/week) were used as covariates in all basic models, and an additional adjustment was made for percent body-weight change to test the impact of the dietary/lifestyle intervention regardless of the degree of weight loss achieved. A two-sided α level of 5% was used to indicate statistical significance.  3. Results The trial flowchart is presented in Figure 1. A total of 260 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients were screened for eligibility, and 187 middle-aged patients (49 ± 10 years) with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (median (1st, 3rd quartile) and had moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (apnea hypopnea index (AHI): 58 (31–85) events/h; 77% had severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (and had moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 30 events/h)),",fda2471a-5153-4c62-ba9b-7ab0439fff6a

Baseline characteristics of the total randomized sample and the study groups are presented in Table 1. The majority of patients were men (75%), obese (80%), exhibited a medium adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDietScore: 32.1 ± 4.4) and a low physical activity level (median (1st, 3rd quartile) min/d: 13 (2.9, 34)). Regarding their cardiometabolic risk profile, the majority exhibited increased WC values (90%) and hypertension (72%), approximately half (55%) had decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), and 43% and 24% had hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia, respectively, with 62% of patients being diagnosed with MS.",3a89155a-9b82-4d37-8bb8-c262ae1be154
23,methods23," No significant between-group differences were observed in cardiometabolic or other sociodemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle and clinical characteristics at baseline (Table 1). Although all patients were instructed to initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, 82%, 69% and 77% from the standard care group (SCG), the Mediterranean diet group (MDG) and the Mediterranean lifestyle group (MLG), respectively, actually started the treatment (p = 0.2).  A total of seven patients were excluded post-randomization and drop-out rates were 35% (22/62) for the standard care group (SCG), 29% (17/59) for the Mediterranean diet group (MDG) and 24% (14/59) for the Mediterranean lifestyle group (MLG) (Figure 1).

34,methods34," the Mediterranean lifestyle group (MLG) only exhibited a lower relative risk of decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and a trend for a lower relative risk of MS compared to both the standard care group (SCG) and the Mediterranean diet group (MDG) (Supplemental Results Table S5).  4. Discussion In the present randomized controlled clinical trial among adult, overweight, newly-diagnosed moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, the combination of a weight-loss intervention based on the healthy Mediterranean dietary/lifestyle pattern with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) standard care achieved greater improvements in cardiometabolic parameters, namely insulin resistance, lipidemic profile indices, liver enzymes, blood pressure and the presence of the MS and its components, compared to standard care alone, i.e., prescription of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and brief written lifestyle advice.",41fb37fb-dfc0-48c0-907a-be8bf7772059
35,methods35," In addition, the Mediterranean lifestyle intervention, targeting not only a healthy diet but also increased physical activity and optimal sleep habits, combined with standard care, had additional benefits in reducing WC compared to standard care alone, as well as an incremental effect in improving high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels and reducing the risk of MS compared to the Mediterranean diet intervention. All cardiometabolic benefits were evident regardless of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use; however, after adjustment for weight loss, improvements persisted only for the Mediterranean lifestyle intervention.  The relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the MS is well documented [34,38] and efficient strategies for the disease management should target not only sleep-disordered breathing but also its cardiometabolic manifestations.",b2fa68b0-b6ba-43b0-8148-6ef27ca22a6a
36,methods36," According to meta-analyses of the available, well-designed, randomized controlled clinical trials, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy does not seem to improve cardiometabolic indices or cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [8,39,40]. Our results confirm the high prevalence of the MS (approximately 60%) in a sample of adult, overweight, moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, and further support that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prescription, traditionally offered alone as standard care to most obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients in clinical practice, is unlikely to yield significant cardiometabolic benefits.",c581a825-e339-49f6-822a-dfbadf482b3a
37,methods37,"  The effects of lifestyle weight-loss interventions on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) management have been thoroughly examined, and the available interventional studies support their efficacy in improving the disease severity, as indicated by significant reductions in the and had moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (apnea hypopnea index (AHI), as well as daytime symptomatology and quality of life, with a clear advantage compared to no intervention [9,10]. Nonetheless, only few studies have explored the potential benefits of weight loss in other endpoints related to cardiometabolic health. In 2014, Chirinos et al. [11] showed that only obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients subjected to weight loss, either alone or in combination with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), exhibited a decrease in TG, Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) and C-reactive protein levels and an increase in insulin sensitivity assessed through a glucose-tolerance test.",991eb927-64d0-4f57-8235-a70d0c9977c6
38,methods38," On the contrary, no improvements were seen in the group of patients receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) alone, besides a reduction in blood pressure which was evident in all three groups. A few more clinical trials have also reported improvements in individual cardiometabolic indices, such as insulin, lipidemic profile indices (TC, Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and TG), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and blood pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) after lifestyle-induced weight loss [12,13,14], but no study to date has examined the effect of lifestyle modifications on the presence of the MS.",40573139-29ec-4b45-b097-1b0f8878ae24
39,methods39," Our study confirms that a weight-loss dietary or lifestyle intervention based on the Mediterranean pattern combined with standard care can produce significant improvements in glucose metabolism parameters, lipidemic profile indices, liver enzymes and blood pressure, and further provides evidence of its superiority in reducing the risk of MS, as compared to standard care alone. The present findings are also in line with current guidelines for the management of overweight and obesity, suggesting that a modest (5–10%) weight loss over six months is sufficient to achieve significant health benefits from decreasing obesity-related comorbidities [41].  In 2011, the Mediterranean lifestyle pyramid was published to replace the older Mediterranean diet pyramid for public health purposes, emphasizing the holistic nature of the healthy way of living of the Mediterranean region that besides prudent dietary choices also includes an adequate physical activity level and optimal sleep habits [22].",d5570e37-5e49-49d8-a2e5-e90166bf42d8
40,methods40," In our study, the Mediterranean lifestyle intervention had the most pronounced benefits on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients’ cardiometabolic profile and resulted in a greater increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels and a greater decrease in WC, insulin resistance and the risk of MS compared to the intervention based solely on the Mediterranean diet. Interestingly, the superiority of the Mediterranean lifestyle intervention in increasing high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and reducing the risk of MS was evident regardless of percent weight change, suggesting that regular physical activity and optimal sleep habits can have additional benefits for the cardiometabolic health of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, on top of weight loss achieved through a healthy dietary pattern, and should therefore be part of lifestyle interventions for the management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).",87d3a382-9aba-42e2-99cb-aa840716891f
41,methods41," A reasonable explanation is the well-established beneficial effect of physical activity on body composition, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels and insulin sensitivity [42], as well as the beneficial effect of an adequate sleep duration and good quality sleep on glucose metabolism [43].  The MIMobstructive sleep apnea (OSA) study is one of the few available randomized controlled clinical trials that aimed at exploring the effects of a comprehensive behavioral dietary/lifestyle intervention on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients’ cardiometabolic profile. In addition, to our best knowledge, this is the first lifestyle intervention study in which the cardiometabolic profile of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients was assessed not only through individual cardiometabolic indices but also through the cumulative presence of the MS.",e1570775-556c-4c6d-a8bd-83272b7a8f1b
42,methods42," Although our results point towards the incorporation of dietary/lifestyle interventions in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) management strategies, our study was a single-center trial and reported findings should be tested in other settings before definite conclusions can be drawn for clinical practice. In addition, standard care in the present study included the prescription but not the provision of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device, a fact that probably contributed to participants’ low adherence to the treatment. Moreover, although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use was extracted by participants from the device reports, misreporting bias cannot be excluded.",c63ee05e-6337-4832-8fe2-688b8d65b6cd
43,methods43," Other limitations of the present work include the absence of a group in which no therapy at all was implemented or groups receiving dietary/lifestyle interventions without continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or weight loss, due to ethical reasons, as well as the high attrition rate, especially for the standard care group (SCG), suggesting that these patients were probably looking for a closer monitoring of their diet and lifestyle. Last but not least, we did not systematically record participants’ feedback on the intervention, such as their rating of the content and structure of the intervention, the difficulties and barriers for adhering to intervention goals, as well as their experience with the group nature of counselling sessions and the group leader (research dietitian).  5. Conclusions In conclusion, the addition of a weight-loss Mediterranean diet or lifestyle intervention to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) standard care, i.e.",72b277e2-d32a-4e51-ab09-732a8d34a477
44,methods44,", continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prescription and brief written advice on healthy lifestyle, has an incremental effect on improving obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients’ cardiometabolic profile over the effect of standard care alone. Interventions incorporating not only healthy dietary patterns, but also adequate physical activity and optimal sleep habits can yield additional weight-loss independent cardiometabolic benefits for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Given the limitations of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy as the sole treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), low-cost behavioral interventions towards modest weight loss and beneficial changes in lifestyle habits that can be implemented in most healthcare settings could constitute a realistic and efficient plan for a comprehensive management of the majority of overweight obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients in clinical practice.
