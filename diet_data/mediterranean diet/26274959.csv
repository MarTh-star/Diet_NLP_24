0,background0,"Women with highly penetrant BRCA mutations have a 55–60 % risk for breast cancer and a 16–59 % risk of developing ovarian cancer [1, 2]. However, since penetrance rates are not 100 %, it can be postulated that risk-modulating factors do exist. It can be shown that the risk of development of cancer in gene carriers may be influenced through genetic factors (polymorphisms) as well as exogenous factors such as number of pregnancies, year of birth, and physical activity during youth [3, 4]. The risk for breast cancer is lower if gene carriers were born before 1940, have given birth, or were physically active during their youth [5, 6].  The risk for developing sporadic breast cancer is considerably influenced by physical activity, nutrition, and body weight factors which also affect disease progression.",9dc486ba-b022-496f-ae4f-07ed97b7a25f
1,background1," Likewise, it has been demonstrated in several prospective studies that regular physical activity can significantly reduce breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal and premenopausal women, the risk being reduced on average by 25 % [7]. Furthermore, the risks of recurrence and mortality in women with breast cancer are reduced by 50 % if they engage in regular physical activity [8]. Further advantages of physical activity include a gain in the quality of life, increased fitness, and better tolerance of chemotherapy [9]. Nutrition also influences the risk for breast cancer. Obesity and weight gain increase the risk of breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal subjects [10]. A weight gain of more than 20 kg after the age of 18 doubles the risk for breast cancer. Furthermore, women with a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) of >30 kg/m2 have a greater risk of developing distant metastases and of dying of breast cancer [11].",b1d9ef7d-0c1a-48cf-854b-553b579b5e1d
2,background2," In a prospective study of patients with sporadic breast cancer who were given adjuvant standard therapy, a calorie- and fat-reduced nutrition program led to a significant improvement in recurrence rate [12]. Additionally, in the prospective PREDIMED prevention trial, women in the Mediterranean diet arm supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil had a 68 % lower risk for breast cancer compared with the controls [13].  Further risk factors for breast cancer include depression, a pessimistic outlook on life, and problems of coping with stress [14, 15]. It was shown that physical activity has a favorable influence on stress management and depression. Many studies have convincingly documented the great significance of an optimistic life perspective for different psychological and somatic disorders [16]. A positive correlation was shown between an optimistic outlook on life and psychological well-being, health, stress reduction, and mortality, as well as a quicker recovery rate [17–19].",9789c31e-6b14-4c37-bc2d-2646f26166a3

There is only one publication on this subject by Manders in 2011 [20], which reports on an association between increased body weight and an increased risk for breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.  We therefore aim to examine whether a lifestyle intervention in the form of structured physical endurance training and nutrition education, emphasizing the Mediterranean dietary pattern, will lead to an improvement of nutritional behavior (adherence to the Mediterranean diet), body mass index (BMI), physical fitness, quality of life, and optimistic outlook on life, and cause a significant reduction of the perceived stress. Secondary aims of the study are to investigate whether the intervention will lead to a reduction of breast cancer incidence and breast cancer mortality in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.",9881fe1f-a52b-4176-82ad-31abc673f4cb
4,background4,"  Design/methods Trial design The study is a multicenter, prospective, two-armed randomized (1:1) controlled clinical trial. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate whether a structured, one-year exercise program combined with a Mediterranean dietary pattern in BRCA mutation carriers will improve body mass index (BMI), physical fitness (ventilatory threshold VT1 in spiroergometry), and adherence to a Mediterranean diet in the intervention group. Additionally, we will analyze whether the lifestyle intervention has a positive effect on quality of life, perceived stress, optimistic outlook on life, breast cancer incidence, and mortality.

8,background8," After a mandatory introductory lecture on the theory behind the intervention training, the goal is to increase physical activity to ≥18 MET-h/week (MET = Metabolic Equivalent of Task). This activity level has been correlated consistently with a reduction of morbidity and mortality in patients with breast cancer [8, 19]. This goal should be achieved within the first 12 weeks and maintained throughout the whole study period. Each subject receives an individual training plan, which is continuously adapted according to her fitness status to support this goal. The training is divided into two phases: the intensity of the first phase should be at least 50–60 % of peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) (initial phase, weeks 1–6), and that of the second phase should be 60–75 % of the VO2 peak (optimization phase, weeks 7–12).",d1bcc90c-62eb-48d4-8acd-4484c9c22213

Most people take a positive view of prevention such as cancer screening, but de facto only a small number of people actively make use of cancer prevention measures. Therefore, for the present LIBRE study, above all due to the question of the practicability of the intervention program in the sense of good compliance, it is important to ask about the attitudes towards lifestyle changes.

(2) Are attitudes, subjective norms, or perceived behavior control towards a behavior relevant for the intention of behavior (i.e., to train regularly and to eat healthfully) and for the de facto behavior shown? To answer these questions, we developed a new questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior according to Fishbein and Ajzen [35]. This theory maintains that the best predictors for planned and deliberate behavior are the intentions related to behavior. Behavioral intentions are defined by attitudes towards a behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavior control. The theory of planned behavior has been examined in many studies dealing with health psychology (e.g., surgery intentions, food adherence, and physical activity behavior among others) [36–40].",124cc394-3925-4349-b542-9ac39ce3d8f5

36,discussion0,"The LIBRE study is one of the first prospective randomized lifestyle intervention trials involving BRCA mutation carriers worldwide. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that a structured one-year exercise program combined with a Mediterranean dietary pattern will improve body mass index (BMI), maximal as well as aerobic and anaerobic physical capacity, and adherence to a Mediterranean diet in BRCA mutation carriers. Additional secondary endpoints are to demonstrate that the lifestyle intervention will also improve psychological parameters, like quality of life, stress coping capacity, and grade of optimism. An important further intention of the trial is to investigate whether the improvement of physical fitness, body weight, quality of life, and stress coping capacity will lead to a reduction of breast cancer risk, progression of disease, and mortality. A similar approach is followed by Pasanisi et al.",02a4134d-a454-4af0-9ce8-a47060fd0d6c
37,discussion1," [42], who published a study protocol for a randomized trial in BRCA mutation carriers to test whether moderate calorie intake and protein restriction together with increasing physical activity will decrease serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). They hypothesized a functional interaction between the BRCA genes and IGF-1 systems, which may be causal for a higher penetrance of breast cancer in those with elevated IGF-1 levels. They further hypothesize that a lifestyle intervention may reduce IGF-1 levels and thereby potentially cancer penetrance.  Both studies will evaluate the role of a lifestyle intervention program in the same cohort of BRCA mutation carriers. Therefore, it seems realistic to add a structured lifestyle intervention program to health care prevention programs in BRCA mutation carriers in the future. Current risk-reducing strategies for women at risk include prophylactic mastectomy and early detection programs.",6d5f38c4-cfc3-4ff1-b706-5927bb9907b9
38,discussion2," With structured exercise and dietary changes, mutation carriers will be able to independently play a role in cancer prevention, which will help to strengthen their self-government. Moreover, it is known that psychological intervention may improve stress symptoms in patients with breast cancer [15]. By improving and optimizing the women’s lifestyle, we expect a preventive health effect not only on a somatic, but also on a mental level.  A limitation of the trial might occur during randomization, especially for highly motivated participants. They may be disappointed if randomized to the control arm, and therefore may withdraw from the study or exercise nonetheless. In addition, cross-over communication regarding the Mediterranean dietary pattern between the intervention and control group cannot be completely avoided. On the other hand, it might be difficult for less motivated working women or mothers to integrate the exercise program into their everyday life.",c4c6d54a-ef30-4cc3-957d-d787d126d3b3
