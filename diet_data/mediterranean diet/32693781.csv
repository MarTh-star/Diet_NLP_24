0,methods0," 3.1. Virgin Olive Oil Samples  A total of 199 Virgin olive oil (VOO) samples were collected from local producers and olive oil mills participating in the research program QuaAuthentic_GR, during the 2017–2018, 2018–2019, and 2019–2020 harvesting periods. The sample set included Virgin olive oil (VOO)s obtained by four single-cultivars: Koroneiki (115 samples), Megaritiki (35 samples), Amfissis (31 samples), and Manaki (18 samples). Sampling was carried out during November throughout the end of January. Olives were picked by hand or collected in nets at the stage of optimum maturity (maturity index 5–6) and processed in selected local olive mills by traditional three-phase system technology with a crusher. Samples were stored in dark glass bottles of 500 mL. The analyses of olive oil samples were performed soon after olive oil production.  3.2.",d3e2c1b6-4b65-44fa-b58b-14858c98686c
1,methods1," Determination of Free Acidity, Peroxide Value and UV Absorption Coefficients  The quality indices including the refractive index were determined according to the official method of the Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91 [24]. Free acidity was expressed as % oleic acid, peroxide value expressed as meq O2/kg, and specific extinction (K232 and K270) and its variation, ΔK, calculated from the absorption at 232–270 nm.  3.3. Determination of Fatty Acids  Fatty acid methyl esters (Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME)) were prepared based on the official method of the Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91 [24]. Methyl esters were prepared by vigorous shaking of the Virgin olive oil (VOO) solution in hexane (0.1 g in 5 mL) with 0.5 mL of 2 N methanolic KOH in a screwcap vial. The analysis was performed by gas chromatography using a Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 chromatograph (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector.",f910c1cf-ae65-4c49-aa3d-b863de0699d9
2,methods2," The column used was Supelco SP-2560 capillary column (75 m × 0.18 mm id × 0.14 μm film thickness) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. An injection volume of 1 μL was used. The injector was operated in split mode (20:1 split ratio) at 250 °C. The column was maintained at 140 °C held for 5 min, heated to 170 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min, heated to 210 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min held for 2 min, heated to 250 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min and held to 250 °C for 10 min. The FA were identified from their retention times, using a Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) standard mixture (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The content of each FA was expressed as a percentage m/m from the peak area.",681b596c-6c24-461b-90ac-844b261d6767

The same software was used for the development of Discriminant Analysis models. One hundred and fifty-eight Virgin olive oil (VOO) samples were used as a training set (92 Koroneiki, 28 Megaritiki, 24 Amfissis, 14 Manaki) and 41 (23 Koroneiki, 7 Megaritiki, 7 Amfissis, 4 Manaki) as an external prediction set.

5,methods5," Conclusions  In the present work, the fatty acid composition of 199 Virgin olive oil (VOO) samples belonging to the cultivars of Koroneiki, Megaritiki, Amfissis, and Manaki was determined and studied by chemometrics. The elevated levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) observed in Amfissis (76.37%), and Koroneiki (75.81%) samples, as well as the high monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)/PUFA ratio (9.77% for Koroneiki and 8.06% for Amfissis), suggested high oxidative stability of the virgin olive oils derived from both cultivars. above quality parameters were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) post-hoc tests revealed significant differences mainly among the fatty acids palmitoleic acid (16:1), gadoleic acid (20:1), arachidonic acid (20:4), and linoleic acid (18:2) indicating their potent contribution on the classification of samples with respect to cultivar.",04fc4d46-955b-4119-8b18-edca4bfb3e80
6,methods6," Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients between fatty acids highlighted both differences and similarities within the olive oil cultivars possibly attributed to the enzymes regulating the fatty acid biosynthesis. The application of principal components analysis did not effectively separated Koroneiki and Manaki olive oil samples though samples derived from Amfissis and Megaritiki were more clearly classified. The fatty acids, arachidonic acid (20:4), gadoleic acid (20:1), linoleic acid (18:2), α-linolenic acid (18:3), palmitoleic acid (16:1), and palmitic acid (16:0) were identified from the forward stepwise algorithm as the most significant for the botanical differentiation of Virgin olive oil (VOO)s. From the subsequent application of linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, 100.00% and 99.37% correct classification of samples was achieved, correspondingly.",21f11bc8-5c34-47be-8907-98acfb16e11a
7,methods7," The chemometric models were validated by cross-validation and an external prediction set which was utilized to confirm the model’s robustness, providing a rate of 100.00% and 98.10% for the cross-validation, whereas the percentage obtained from the prediction set was 97.56% and 92.68%, for linear and quadratic discriminant analysis respectively. The current study accentuates the distinctive characteristics of Greek Virgin olive oil (VOO) associated with the fatty acid composition, while concurrently contributes to the efforts towards the characterization and authentication of Greek olive oil.",043ceaf3-ed2a-4367-bd35-1a21d782aec1
