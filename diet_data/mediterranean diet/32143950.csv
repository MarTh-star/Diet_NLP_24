0,introduction0," Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common metabolic disorder, and it is defined as diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior gestation [1]. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with an increased risk of future health complications for mother and child, including adverse perinatal outcomes, high subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease [2–5]. Multiple risk factors for Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have already been identified, including increased body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and weight gain during pregnancy, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, advanced maternal age, and sedentary lifestyle before or during pregnancy. Growing evidence suggests that also the complex interaction between genetics, epigenetics, and diverse environmental factors plays a role in the pathogenesis of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [6–11].",35ccdbfe-58a3-4355-bf5f-5e3ed331db74
1,introduction1,"  Some maternal metabolic factors, including pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), influence the foetal growth trajectories and affect children’s susceptibility to lifetime chronic diseases, including possible transgenerational effects [12, 13]. This mechanism fits well with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis, which proposes that the origin of chronic diseases is related to a prenatal exposure to a suboptimal foetal environment [14, 15]. In this view, the exact mechanism responsible for the complexity of metabolic status in Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is poorly understood, but some studies have observed epigenetic dysregulation in foetal metabolic programming of newborns exposed to maternal hyperglycaemia during pregnancy.",126cf92d-a6cf-4c82-a8e4-571d548f032f
2,introduction2," Several authors have investigated the potential associations between DNA methylation in placenta collected at birth and maternal hyperglycaemia, since the former is a critical protagonist in the regulation of foetal growth and development. In its role as a controller of maternal foetal nutrient exchanges via epigenetic mechanisms, placenta responds to foetal demands and maternal availability of nutrients [16].  To date, the vast majority of studies have focused on DNA methylation changes in candidate genes mainly involved in the pathways of energy balance, glucose and lipid metabolism, and their association with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [17–21].  At present, the correlation between the methylation profiles of fat mass and obesity-associated (Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO)) gene on the maternal and foetal sides of the placenta and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains unexplored.",65f41624-cd59-492f-a2a3-a49efe234e24
3,introduction3," The Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene encodes an RNA demethylase which is expressed predominantly in the hypothalamus as well as across other tissues, including placenta. Increased Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) mRNA levels are associated with higher foetal weight and length as well as higher placental weight, suggesting Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) as a regulator of the partitioning between placenta and foetal growth [22].  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) are the strongest known genetic risk factors for obesity and have been linked with body mass index (BMI), Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), T2DM, and eating behaviour [8, 23–26]. Although the functions of Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) remain undefined, some studies demonstrated that it influences the expression of IRX3, a homoeobox gene involved in pattern formation in the early embryo with effects on body weight [27, 28].",5183c7b6-28c2-4e8a-88cc-152c8b35e6b4
4,introduction4,"  In addition, it has been suggested that Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) could be involved in the cellular sensing of amino acids, in the regulation of cell growth, and in the global mRNA translation through the mTORC1 pathway [29]. Placental amino acid transporters control foetal growth and regulate the supply of nutrients to the foetus. In this view, Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) could potentially regulate foetal growth by altering the placental amino acid transport [30]. To date, the exact mechanisms through which Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene influences growth and body composition are unknown.  The study of the epigenetic differences between placental tissues in Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and in controls may contribute to explain higher long-term metabolic disturbances and obesity in Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) mothers and their newborns.",81d12cc5-163c-44b2-85bd-2a63bfe2f29a
5,introduction5," Therefore, we hypothesize that maternal metabolic status could affect placenta’s Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) DNA methylation profile, influencing foetal metabolic programming. The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the exposure to an altered intrauterine environment and foetal metabolic programming, focusing on Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and DNA methylation profiles at promoter-associated CpG islands of the Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene.

6,methods0," Socio-demographic characteristics, clinical parameters at the third trimester of pregnancy, Mediterranean diet adherence, and physical activity were assessed in 33 Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women and 27 controls. Clinical information about the newborns was registered at birth. The Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) rs9939609 (T > A) was genotyped.   Study design and participants  Sixty Caucasian pregnant women attending the Diabetes, Nutrition and Metabolism Unit and the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinic, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, “G. D’Annunzio” University of Chieti-Hospital “SS Annunziata” of Chieti, were recruited.  The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the “G. D’Annunzio” University, Chieti-Pescara (Italy). In compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, all subjects provided a written informed consent before their inclusion in the study.  During the first visit, data on demographic characteristics were collected.",36ba4332-3455-4291-9ce6-888fea33479d
7,methods1," Anthropometric parameters were measured and recorded according to standard procedures. Clinical parameters (blood glucose, lipid profile [total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG)], and blood pressure) were recorded at the third trimester. Physical activity was assessed using a short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)), registering three different levels of intensity (low, moderate, and high PA) [31]. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) was evaluated through a validated 14-item questionnaire (PREDIMED), which generates a range of possible scores, namely (i) no adherence (score ≤ 5), (ii) medium adherence (6 ≤ score ≤ 9), and (iii) maximum adherence (score ≥ 10) [32].  At delivery, placenta biopsies were collected.",a3c4f748-ffe9-4834-81be-d19fc1a6ebdf
8,methods2," Clinical information about the newborns (including mode of delivery, gestational age, sex, and anthropometric measurements) was collected at birth.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria  The inclusion criteria accepted women with ≥ 18 years of age. The Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosis was performed following the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG)) criteria [33, 34]. The exclusion criteria were type 1 or 2 diabetes, overt diabetes, other chronic diseases (including malignancy, hypercholesterolemia) as well as a positive history of drug or alcohol abuses.  Placenta tissue sampling  Placenta tissues were sampled within a few minutes after delivery and placental expulsion. Two biopsies of 0.5 cm3 were taken on the foetal and maternal sides.",96ee3b18-aa0e-4afc-abca-53b5cbbc4b08
9,methods3,"  The procedures we deployed for placental tissue collection consisted in washing the tissue in order to remove the blood present in the original sample. This is an optimized procedure for epigenomic analysis in the clinical setting, as reported in the literature [18, 21, 35–38].  In detail, placental biopsies were washed in PBS 1 × to remove cord/maternal blood and dissected to remove conjunctive tissues. The samples were kept in RNAlater Stabilization Solution (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at −80 °C until nucleic acid extraction. DNA was purified from placenta biopsies using MagPurix 12s Automated Nucleic Acid Purification System (Zinexts Life Science Corp., Taiwan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Epigenetic analysis (DNA methylation analysis)  DNA methylation levels at CpG sites were assessed using pyrosequencing (Pyromark Q96; Qiagen).",29299d3e-2cf0-45eb-9415-2a545daca32c

After bisulphite treatment, DNA (~ 20 ng) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the Kapa Hifi Hotstart Uracil + HotStart ReadyMix (Roche Diagnostics) and pyrosequenced according to manufacturer’s recommendations. The conditions in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) stage were 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles at 98 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 7 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min.",b5f53be1-a485-49f4-83e5-1114bf9bec34
11,methods5,"  The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and pyrosequencing primers for all four CpGs tested within the Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene were Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO)F: 5′-TTTGGAGTTATTTTTTTTTTGAGTAGAAA-3′, Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO)R: 5′-[Btn] ATTCTCCTTAAACTCTAACCTATTTACT-3′ (168 bp), and Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO)Seq: 5′-TTTTAGGTTAGATAGTTGGAAGA-3′ (4 CpGs) according to previous studies [39].  Four of all DNA samples (two from the mother’s side and two from the foetal’s side) did not amplify and therefore were not analysed.  The specificity of pyrosequencing assays is 100% and the sensitivity is approximately 5%, in terms of percentage of methylated cytosines detectable in a sample containing both methylated and unmethylated cytosines [40, 41].",65946852-8e8c-4a26-8708-69fd7785e8d0
12,methods6," Nevertheless, the detection limit (limit (LOD)) for several mutant alleles (such as in EGFR and KRAS mutations) evaluated in routine diagnostic setting and supported by commercially available assays (Pyro Kit Qiagen) reaches up to 0.6%. Consequently, this supports the reliability to consider the limit (LOD) up to 1%.  Genotyping  The rs9939609 (T > A) SNP in Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) was genotyped in all 60 pregnant women. All DNA samples were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) performed in 30-μl reaction volume containing 30 ng of genomic DNA in a SimpliAmp™ thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems™), using the AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min.",0e907e0c-4156-4965-bd47-cdd108fa47a0

14,analysis0," Descriptive statistics relied on median and interquartile ranges (interquartile ranges (IQR)) for quantitative variables and on absolute and relative frequencies for qualitative variables. The entire cohort was divided according to the Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) status. Differences in median were tested using the Mann–Whitney test, while differences in proportions were tested with the Chi-squared test, applying the Fisher’s exact correction when appropriated. Tobit models were fitted in order to test predictors of methylation levels among each island. We relied on tobit regression models that allow to account for left censored data, after observing the CpGs were mainly unmethylated. The tobit model assumed a normal distribution for the dependent variable with left-censoring at 0 [44].",ddf92aec-5e50-402b-9ee6-1be689ebf376
15,analysis1,"  A further stratification for both Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and normoglycaemic (normal glucose tolerance, NGT) women was used according to the DNA methylation level of the different CpGs defining as “methylated” those women who showed at least 1% of DNA methylation for each CpG site or on the average. Concordance between methylated status for each CpG on the maternal and foetal side was also explored. Percentage of agreement was estimated, and the McNemar’s test was applied.  For the investigated SNP, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was calculated.  Given the exploratory nature of the current study, we did not adjust p-values to control family-wise error rate (family wise error rate (FWER)).  All the statistical analyses were performed using R Statistical Software (version 4.0.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). All tests were two tailed, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant association. ",188a0ea7-4179-47d1-9e79-a2a5da3482fa

The demographic and clinical characteristics of the women (Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) = 33 and NGT = 27) are reported in Table 1. Among women with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), insulin treatment became necessary for five subjects. The Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosis was performed at 16–18 weeks of gestation for six women and at 24–28 weeks for 26 women, respectively. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women showed a higher median body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy (25.2 vs. 21.6; p = 0.022) when compared with controls; an increase in weight gain at the delivery compared to the weight measured in pre-gestational period was observed in control group (10.0 vs. 12.0 kg; p = 0.037).

22,discussion0," Our study focused on methylation profiles of the Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene on both the maternal and foetal sides of the placenta in pregnant women with and without Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  Pregnancy can be considered a critical time of rapid physical and physiological changes. In this context, the placenta is a unique organ which influences maternal physiology and is likely to play a role in maternal insulin sensitivity changes during pregnancy. The placenta optimizes foetal growth, protects the foetus against infections, and produces key hormones to maintain pregnancy [16].  It has been shown that the offspring of women with aberrant alterations in metabolic pathways during pregnancy are at risk of developing future health complications [45–47], but the underlying mechanisms linking the maternal metabolic status to the offspring outcomes remain to be determined.",49f4f3d6-4a4e-4c74-a19e-00fc25a37065
23,discussion1," DNA methylation, the most studied type of epigenetic mark occurring mostly at cytosine–phosphate–guanine dinucleotides, has been shown to be sensitive to environmental insults including in utero and postnatal environmental conditions [48–52]. In particular, data have shown that early-life exposures and their effects on lifetime metabolic disease are mediated by DNA methylation alterations in the gene pathways involved in the endocrine function, metabolism, and insulin responses.  Reichetzeder et al. [53] analysed the placental DNA methylation patterns of 1,030 pregnant women and revealed a significantly higher frequency of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the group with the most methylated placental DNA. In this view, Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is correlated with an altered placental function and changes in the placental gene regulation via epigenetic mechanisms [see review 4].",46681cda-0698-48c4-a293-ff56bf9cc8a9
24,discussion2," In particular, several studies have shown that Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) epigenetically affects genes that are predominantly involved in metabolic pathways [17, 19, 54].  Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) has been researched for a long time due to the strong association of its SNPs with energy homeostasis and body composition [55–57]. Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) influences the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression promoting m6A demethylation on mRNA transcripts [58, 59], but its function is still largely unknown. A significant role of the hypothalamic Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) expression [60] as well as a relationship between Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) and weight gain [59, 61] due to several mRNA transcripts dynamically altered in response to diverse availabilities of energy and nutrient has been suggested [62, 63].",2a3f43a5-a9ec-42f0-852a-3d6c01d14837
25,discussion3," In addition, Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) overexpression leads to obesity and increased appetite [64], while loss protein evolves in lean phenotypes [65]. Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) is expressed and secreted by the placenta during pregnancy; also, several data suggest that Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) may regulate the transcription of genes involved in foetal growth by nucleic acid demethylation [22, 66].  In our study, we did not find any association between placental DNA methylation in the Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene in Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women. At first, we found that CpG dinucleotides within Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene promoter were mainly unmethylated with only very limited DNA methylation level variability.",844c317e-95e5-48ac-bbd7-3c05a1678f77
26,discussion4," We might speculate that the absence of correlation between Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and DNA methylation levels in the Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene might be explained by a good maternal glycaemic control obtained by diet alone or diet and insulin from Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosis to delivery, thus alleviating the impact of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on the newborn’s epigenome. In support of this, as reported previously with regard to different analytic techniques, only modest changes on the placenta protein profile were observed in well-controlled Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [67].  DNA methylation changes can be mediated by both genetic and modifiable lifestyle factors. In our sample, up to 40% of women smoked during pregnancy. Interestingly, noteworthy studies showed long-term effect on offspring adiposity induced by maternal smoke [68].",721be44a-91e4-4510-aa9c-ac401531e230
27,discussion5," When considering exploratory analyses differentiating the DNA methylation levels in “unmethylated” and “methylated” in both groups, we found differences in the methylation patterns that occur in women exposed to tobacco smoke during pregnancy and that these differences were detected in placental DNA from the maternal side. The exposed Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and NGT women had a significantly higher level of methylation at CpG1 and CpG3 site compared with unexposed ones. The association between tobacco smoking and altered DNA methylation patterns has been shown for a number of single genes, mostly related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and hypoxia, as well as in genome-wide methylation studies [69–71] showing some of the CpG sites associated with low birthweight in the offspring or decreased gestational age [72, 73].",7c4acba2-0708-413d-9451-724b8d8019ba
28,discussion6," So far, these studies have suggested that the maternal smoking deregulates the placental methylation in CpGs which correlates with alterations in gene expression along signature pathways [69, 74, 75].  It should be emphasised that the maternal conditions including lipids profile have been shown to be detrimental for foetal development and lipid metabolism independently of maternal hyperglycaemia [76, 77]. Interestingly, our findings showed a significant association between foetal placental DNA methylation levels and third-trimester TGs within the Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) group. Moreover, an inverse correlation between maternal placental DNA methylation levels and third-trimester HDL-C within the control group was found. These results were consistent with those of our previous studies [8–10] which highlighted the importance of lipid parameters related to genetic markers during the third trimester.",de154a28-eba0-4a95-a9da-e5b8ca55b816
29,discussion7," Therefore, further studies are needed in order to determine how lipid profile can impair the placental epigenome.  The current literature has also proposed that DNA methylation patterns may be highly associated with specific genotypes, suggesting that the effect of genetic variants related to nutrients and metabolism may be exerted via epigenetic alterations and explaining the long-term interindividual variability in risk of obesity and diabetes [78, 79]. Our study showed that mothers’ Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) rs9939609 gene polymorphism presented an impact on birthweight. In fact, we found a higher birthweight expressed as percentiles in the offspring of women with rs9939609 AA genotype when compared with those with mothers carrying the T allele. Birthweight represents a predictor for the development, growth, and the afterwards adult period [80], and it is influenced by multiple factors and the interaction between them.",3ad22b27-d3fc-48ee-ae76-fea39d3de116
30,discussion8," In this context, the genetic susceptibility also seems an essential factor which may affect obesity-related phenotypes.  This study has some limitations. First of all, although 60 placental samples (total 120) can be considered a good sample size for DNA methylation, it should be noted that many DNA methylation patterns are tissue specific and cell specific (i.e. fat, liver, skeletal muscle, pancreatic islets). Therefore, it would be interesting to compare the Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) methylation profiles in placentas to DNA methylation levels in blood.",a201b78d-be53-49da-afb4-eba692abc972
31,discussion9," Secondly, in order to provide an understanding of the link between metabolic programming and the increased incidence of metabolic diseases related to an altered intrauterine environment, future studies will be needed to investigate the possible correlation between obesity and DNA methylation levels, as well as the comparison of the different methylation patterns of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) women treated with diet alone versus those treated with both diet and insulin.  In summary, the role of the maternal metabolism in regulating the placental epigenome still remains unclear. Although emerging evidence has demonstrated the fundamental role of Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) in the energy homeostasis and body composition, the effects of the epigenetic alterations of this gene as well as maternal metabolic disturbances are largely unexplored.",3fc6c122-90ee-4d64-b422-2f8a2e9c7247
32,discussion10," It should be noted that all Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) participants were attentively supervised and proved to be fully compliant to the treatment, reaching their glycaemic targets: such thorough monitoring might have had a preventive effect on possible epigenetic modifications. A strength of this study is that, to our knowledge, this is the first research exploring the placental DNA methylation profile of Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene in Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). In addition, this is the first attempt at the association between placental Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) DNA methylation and maternal metabolic characteristics (including unhealthy lifestyle and third-trimester lipid parameters). Therefore, our data offer some insights into the pathophysiology of obesity related to maternal habits, as well as to diet and environmental conditions during pregnancy.",e9156b26-bbae-4418-9f6f-43deebcdbc45
33,discussion11," This perspective suggests the need for further insight into epigenetic modifications, so as to clarify the role of molecular mechanisms impacting on the foetus during pregnancy. So, we can say that in well-controlled Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)-affected women, placental epigenetic effects are related to the maternal smoking and TGs. Interestingly, an association between maternal Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) rs9939609 and neonatal birthweight was detected. In the awareness that the pathophysiology of obesity is very complex and in the recognition of the countless factors involved in long-term metabolic health of offspring of the Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) mothers, the present study adds a piece to this strenuous and intricate mosaic.
