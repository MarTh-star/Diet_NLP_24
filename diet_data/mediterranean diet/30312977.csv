0,introduction0,"Adipose tissue is not recognized anymore simply as fat storage but is now accepted as an endocrine organ, and an important source of biologically active substances with local and/or systemic action.1 However, the ability of the adipose tissue to develop excessively also poses a series of molecular and cellular alterations affecting systemic metabolism,2 promoting a state of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation even in pediatric ages,3 a condition that tends to track from childhood to adolescence and from adolescence to adulthood.4 For example, increases in fat mass during the pubertal growth of Finnish girls5 were able to explain the increases in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) levels 7.5 years later. In addition, data from the Bogalusa study6 showed that body fatness in childhood was the major predictor of higher C reactive protein (CRP) and lower adiponectin levels in young adulthood.",40de7e8d-0dab-49b6-ac78-17feb5eac50a
1,introduction1," The early development of excessive adiposity and its circumstances appear thereby to contribute to an increased risk and to the premature onset of a series of cardiometabolic disorders,7,8 and as such, its close monitoring is important.9  Skinfold thickness (skinfold thickness (SKF)) measurements and bioelectrical impedance analysis (bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)) are 2 nonlaboratory methods frequently used to assess adiposity and to estimate body fat percentage (BF%).10 The method of skinfold thickness (SKF) measurements is based on the idea that a collective measure of subcutaneous adipose tissue from various sites on the body may provide a good estimate of total body fat,11,12 and several site-specific skinfold measurements are used in regression equations (eg, of Slaughter et al13) to estimate BF% in children and adolescents.",19e0db3a-97b3-4203-833b-4a93e2783a30
2,introduction2," The methodology of skinfold thickness (SKF) measurements is quite simple in its essence,14 and has been widely used for measurement of body fat in epidemiological settings.10 However, it requires well-trained assessors who can master the procedures of determining the measurement site, pinching the skin, and handling and reading the calliper to avoid errors.  Due to its simplicity (no special skill or training is needed from the operators), quickness, painless, and noninvasive characteristics, and increasingly cheaper, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is also considered a practical method to estimate BF% in adolescents15 on epidemiological settings, such as in school-based studies, and in groups of the same ethnicity and without any underlying medical conditions.",a6bac64e-ad28-4c9d-9bc0-0062b0d1169f
3,introduction3,"16,17 This technique measures the impedance of the body to a small electrical current, and is based on the premise that lean tissue acts as a good electrical conductor, while fat resists the transmission of the electrical impulse. However, some inconsistencies have been reported when bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is compared with reference laboratorial methods, highlighting the need for further analysis.18  Although the broadly use of these techniques in epidemiological studies, to the best of our knowledge, no study have explored and compared the ability of BF% estimations by these methods in identifying increased levels of biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk in adolescents.",3b123ea3-ab12-4bde-a642-93a41b5ff0a5

Assessments Anthropometric measurements All anthropometric measurements were performed in a private place, in the presence of 2 researchers of the same sex as the participant, with all adolescents lightly dressed with a t-shirt, shorts, and barefoot.  Bodyweight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg, using a portable electronic weight scale (Tanita Inner Scan BC 532, Tokyo, Japan). Body height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm, with the adolescent standing upright against a portable stadiometer (Seca 213, Hamburg, Germany).",3c161ce3-e334-4a5e-9326-94acba75816d

Some limitations of this study should be mentioned.",d6b6aac0-e4dd-4c3b-aa56-9831ce2b508f
35,discussion10," First, its cross-sectional design does not allow us to assess the directionality of the relationships between both methods of BF% estimation and the different biomarkers; second, the use of a leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) instead of a tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) may be a limitation in this study, due to the typical fat distribution in adolescents; third, a criterion method to compare with the 2 analyzed methods of BF% estimation was not used, thus, making the inferences about under or overestimation of BF% values by each method uncertain, so, future research should consider the inclusion of a gold standard test, in order to clarify this point.",93cfb7cf-d75a-4045-b88c-e7dafdc7a9a7
36,discussion11," Although the method validated by Tanner and colleagues is widely used in studies of epidemiological characteristics involving children, because of the greater logistical ease in large samples, and its noninvasive nature, this method may not be as accurate as the direct observation of children by a pediatrician. Lastly, the use of a unique measure of each biomarker may not accurately represent a long-term pattern of that specific biomarker.  Nevertheless, in an attempt to minimize and improve this last point, we analyzed not one, but several biomarkers, which provide us a more consistent scenery of the cardiometabolic status. Another strength of this study is that our results indicate that 2 simple and largely used methods of BF% estimation, may be seen as an indirect strategy that could provide an overview of several inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers of a sample of adolescents.",608ef651-3b4b-4a6d-8677-7e6392a78011
37,discussion12," This hypothesis may be of special interest in epidemiological settings, when a large number of subjects are assessed and, due to financial, time or legal constraints, blood samples cannot be easily taken.  In conclusion, the main findings of this study suggest that both methods present discriminatory ability in identifying unfavorable levels in all biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk in girls, whereas in boys this was not observed. Moreover, in girls, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) presented a slightly better overall diagnostic performance for each biomarker than skinfold thickness (SKF), while in boys no method clearly prevailed over the other.
