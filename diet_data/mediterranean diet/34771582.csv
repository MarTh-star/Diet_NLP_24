All protocols and experiments were approved by the “Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of BIONAND”, Málaga, Spain (23/10/2018/151). Randomly cycling female CD1 mice (Janvier Labs, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) were acclimated for 4 weeks and housed in a humidity and temperature-controlled vivarium and maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle with food (Table S1) and water ad libitum.  2.2. Humanized Gnotobiotic Mouse Model  A humanized gnotobiotic mouse model was developed through the fecal microbiota transplantation of human feces into mice.",39755c67-193a-4d3b-9fa4-1cff3e301af2
1,methods1," Prior to the transplantation procedure, 18-week-old mice (n = 40) were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for 10 consecutive days to induce gut microbiota depletion, combining both oral gavage administration and drinking water supplementation. Thus, mice were orally treated by gavage every 12 h with an antibiotic cocktail (10 mL kg−1 body weight) consisting of vancomycin (5 mg mL−1), neomycin (10 mg mL−1) and metronidazole (10 mg mL−1), and ampicillin was administered in drinking water (1 g L−1) [36,37,38]. Then, mice received a fecal microbiota transplantation derived from a selection of patients to recolonize the gastrointestinal tract, as previously described [38]. Specifically, three patients with Ischemic heart disease (IHD), T2DM and high plasma levels of trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) were eligible for feces donation.",744775bd-55da-4360-a67b-7566f1db8861

In contrast, mice from the control group were given drinking water without L-carnitine. The essential oils were administered daily by gavage at 100 mg kg−1 for 40 days after considering their spectrum of action and effective dose [41]. Following the same procedure, mice from the control and carnitine groups were administered daily by gavage with the vehicle emulsion. To avoid any confounder, treatments were always applied in the same order of groups, relocating the mice in a clean cage until the last mouse was treated. However, four mice died during the treatment period and the number of animals per group at the end of treatments was as follows: (1) control group, n = 7; (2) carnitine group, n = 7; (3) savory group, n = 8; (4) parsley group, n = 8; and (5) rosemary group, n = 6.  2.4.",3266b598-66bc-414b-9019-6c0eb70d092e

Discussion  Evidence supports that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is strongly associated with a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease [45,46,47]. In fact, the Mediterranean diet is recommended to patients, as it was shown to be effective for prevention of cardiovascular events [48,49]. Some components of the Mediterranean diet such as olive oil provide cardiovascular benefits, antithrombotic properties [50,51] and improves postprandial lipemia concentration, which is typically elevated in patients with T2DM [52].",ae29b125-b98f-4752-9393-04b52b4e9883
40,methods41," In recent years, interest in functional components from herbal medicines has increased, supported by the confirmed medicinal potential of essential oils [53]. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of essential oils from savory, parsley and rosemary, which are commonly used condiments in the Mediterranean diet, using a higher dose than within a regular diet. We used the essential oils as potential nutraceuticals and assessed their effects on microbial populations, their metabolites (trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) in plasma and SCFAs in feces) and plasma markers (cardiovascular disease, inflammation and oxidative stress), using a humanized mouse model harboring colonic microbiota derived from that of patients with Ischemic heart disease (IHD) and T2DM.",c0f84b4c-b5e6-4556-b25f-8ea9de926849
41,methods42," The main results of this study are as follows: (a) Treatments with essential oil emulsions of savory, parsley and rosemary had prebiotic effects on gut microbiota by inducing an increase in Lactobacillus genus, which are considered beneficial bacteria; (b) Plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels, a pro-atherogenic substance related to the pathogenicity of Ischemic heart disease (IHD) and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [54], were significantly reduced after treatment with essential oils, more specifically with parsley and rosemary; (c) Fecal levels of SCFA species were increased after treatment with parsley and rosemary essential oils, which suggests a beneficial effect of these essential oils on the gastrointestinal health; (d) Plasma thrombomodulin levels were increased after treatments with essential oils of savory and parsley; (e) Overall,",f097748f-893c-45e8-a428-62eaf4c7215f
42,methods43," essential oils had anti-inflammatory effects through alterations in the plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines; and (f) Finally, there was a reduction in the expression of protein carbonyls and pentosidine.  High-level adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been positively associated with changes in gut microbiota composition and their metabolites [55]. Gut microbiota uses L-carnitine as a precursor to generate trimethylamine (TMA), which is rapidly absorbed into the portal circulation by passive diffusion across the enterocyte membranes and then oxidized to trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) by the action of hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenases (mainly FMO3) [56]. As expected, our results showed that trimethylamine (TMA) was only increased after administration of L-carnitine, but we did not observe changes in trimethylamine (TMA) levels after treatments with different essential oil emulsions.",1fc212ed-3e84-4595-87ef-4c449164ed7b
43,methods44," In contrast, we observed a significant reduction of plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels in the parsley and rosemary groups that cannot be explained by changes in the trimethylamine (TMA) levels. Therefore, the treatments with parsley and rosemary essential oils likely affect the metabolism of trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) by decreasing the oxidative activity of FMO3 and/or increasing the mobilization of trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) (i.e., absorption by tissues or excretion in urine) [57]. However, the exact mechanism has to be elucidated, and further research is needed.",d27793a8-186f-41dd-b7fe-b1afa31ec111
44,methods45,"  Among others, the microorganisms linked to high concentrations of pro-atherogenic substances, mainly trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O), include species from Firmicutes, Pseudomonas, Bacillota and Proteobacteria phyla, such as Anaerococcus hydrogenalis, Clostridium asparagiforme, Clostridium hathewayi, Clostridium sporogenes, Escherichia fergusonii, Proteus penneri or Providencia rettgeri [58]. In fact, these microorganisms were found to a lesser extent in the colonic microbiota of patients presenting low levels of trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) in plasma [59]. However, after correlation analysis, we found that trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels were not significantly associated with the abundance of different groups of gut microbiota.",c7583a1f-443a-44fb-bf7e-eafb16004ee1
45,methods46," This fact would support the idea that the trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) inhibition provoked by these essential oils would be based on the trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) oxidation hampering, instead of the bacterial role.  Specific dietary components could also alter gut microbiota composition and activity [60]. Colonic microbiota populations play a key role in the generation of SCFAs, with a positive impact on the metabolism of the host [16]. Within the SCFA, acetate is present in highest proportions in subjects with adherence to the Mediterranean diet [60]. In our results, we observed that Mediterranean plant-derived essential oils alter the fecal composition of SCFA species, as previously reported [61]. More specifically, essential oil emulsions of parsley and rosemary induced an increase in the acetic acid levels, the most abundant SCFA.",e89a14fd-a343-4ae6-9a32-e800f1c6c30b
46,methods47," These results are consistent with the increase in Lactobacillus genus population observed in our results, which is one of the highest contributors to the production of acetic acid [62]. In addition, we also observed an increase in the fecal levels of propionic and butyric acids in the rosemary group. In this regard, the higher content of SCFAs seems to be also linked to the increased percentage of Barnesiella genus in the gut microbiota by the effect of rosemary essential oil. Consistently, the positive correlation of this genus with the SCFA levels [63] has been previously reported.  Previous studies demonstrated that SCFAs have a beneficial effect on regulating regulatory T cells [64], revealing the important role of both microbiota and microbiota-derived SCFAs on immune system modulation [65,66]. Our data showed a marked differential effect on plasma inflammatory markers depending on the essential oil administered.",edbc9260-af3f-430f-af5e-7fa04aa0fb2c
47,methods48," Thus, our results suggest a role of savory essential oil in a pro-inflammatory response, while both parsley and rosemary essential oils induce an anti-inflammatory profile, likely linked to a high production of SFCAs. It is worth emphasizing that not all SFCAs play the same role in relation to gut health, lipid metabolism and health status. Acetic and butyric acids are used by rat colonic epithelial cells as an energy source and strengthen the epithelial homeostasis preventing inflammation [67,68]. Considering the observed prebiotic effect, boosting Lactobacillus genus among others, in parallel to the higher levels found for the three main SFCAs and the anti-inflammatory response, rosemary essential oil seems to exert the most beneficial effect.  In previous studies, the Mediterranean diet has been associated with reduced inflammation [69] due to the effect of some of its components.",1c70b6c9-ce01-4c9b-96f7-b141fdce9b21
48,methods49," In our study, the analysis of plasma inflammatory markers, cytokines and chemokines, showed different profiles depending on the type of essential oil used in the treatment. Thus, savory essential oil induced an increase in the levels of chemokines CXCL1, CCL2 and CCL11 and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL−6 and IL−23. Moreover, savory essential oil induced a decrease in IL−4 levels, which is a typical anti-inflammatory cytokine. On the contrary, parsley essential oil induced a more anti-inflammatory pattern showing low levels of IFNγ and IL−22 cytokines. Finally, treatment with rosemary essential oil emulsion clearly showed an anti-inflammatory profile, reducing the levels of IFNγ, TNFα, IL−12p and IL−22. In addition, we found increased levels of CXCL10 in all groups supplemented with L-carnitine when compared with the control group. CXCL10 is a pro-inflammatory chemokine that can be secreted by numerous cell types in response to an inflammatory process, regulating cell recruitment [70].",8b0c4dc6-d111-4165-966a-df6dd5b3bb10
49,methods50," Its function can be regulated by cytokines, such as IFNγ and TNFα [71,72,73], and it has been proposed, together with CXCL9 and CXCL11, as a biomarker for heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction [74,75]. It has been previously reported that essential oils can modulate the secretion of important cytokines, having an effect in inflammatory pathways such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) [76]. Our results suggest that treatment with parsley and rosemary essential oils may partially compensate for the elevation of the pro-inflammatory chemokine CXCL10 by inducing an anti-inflammatory profile.  These pro- and anti-inflammatory profiles may be also related to the production of thrombomodulin, an anti-coagulant cofactor. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that thrombomodulin exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting leukocyte recruitment [77].",09b4b359-f2a5-445d-b3c9-50ac27c8051a
50,methods51," In addition, the prototypical pro-inflammatory NF-kB signaling pathway has been shown to down-regulate thrombomodulin expression [78]; however, the elevated thrombomodulin expression in the savory and parsley groups was only associated with the decrease in the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL−22, because the expression of other pro-inflammatory cytokines was inconsistent in both groups.  The antioxidant effect of some plant-derived compounds has been previously applied against a series of chronic diseases, such as Ischemic heart disease (IHD) and T2DM [30]. Recently, essential oils of some plants have shown to exhibit important antioxidant activity [79]. To evaluate the antioxidant potential of savory, parsley and rosemary essential oils, we assessed the plasma levels of protein carbonyls and pentosidine after treatment.",a2d5eec3-e8fb-4f81-b254-d1ed3af8f941

A pentosidine is a glycosylation end-product formed by the cross-link of a pentose between arginine and lysine residues of proteins. Production of both carbonyls and pentosidine are induced by oxidative reactions and, therefore, their levels are considered as biomarkers of oxidative stress [80]. Protein oxidation and the accretion of protein carbonyls is a pathological hallmark of multiple chronic diseases, such as T2DM, inflammatory bowel diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, among others [81]. Scientific evidence reports the onset of carbonyl stress in hyperglycemic conditions leading to pancreatic failure, insulin resistance and onset of T2DM [31,82].",ae3b644c-e6e0-46ad-ac5b-babd3fb7e617
52,methods53," In addition, pentosidine is commonly used as an indicator of T2DM complications, such as hypertension and heart failure [83]. We did not observe changes induced by L-carnitine supplementation, despite being an antioxidant compound. However, we found a general reduction in the plasma levels of aldehydes (α aminoadipic semialdehyde (AAS), groups (A) Aminoadipic semialdehyde (aldehydes (α aminoadipic semialdehyde (AAS)) (B) Glutamic semialdehyde (GGS) and pentosidine levels after treatments with essential oil emulsions. Specifically, aldehydes (α aminoadipic semialdehyde (AAS) and pentosidine levels were reduced in mice treated with savory essential oil, while groups (A) Aminoadipic semialdehyde (aldehydes (α aminoadipic semialdehyde (AAS)) (B) Glutamic semialdehyde (GGS) levels were reduced with rosemary essential oil treatment.",0dd202fd-e917-4937-ac61-dd193f290c13

Reduction in inflammation in the parsley and rosemary groups may alleviate the oxidative stress, leading to lower levels of protein carbonyls and pentosidine. The savory group also showed reduced oxidative stress, pointing out that the essential oil may contain compounds with intrinsic antioxidant properties. Our results suggest an antioxidant profile of plant-derived compounds widely used in the Mediterranean diet, such as savory, parsley and rosemary essential oils, when used as nutraceuticals.  We are aware that there are some limitations to the findings reported in this study.

54,methods55," Second, we used a preclinical humanized model, which entails a number of limitations when transferring the findings directly to patients. Third, randomly cycling female mice were used because the variability in 30 categories of behavioral, morphological, physiological, and molecular traits is not higher than in male mice [84], and because female mice housed in groups do not fight [85]; however, we are aware that future studies need to incorporate females and males in equal numbers with explicit comparison of the two sexes and that the inclusion of the estrous cycle stage of female mice contributes to a better characterization in several of these biochemical variables. Finally, we only assessed a single high dose of essential oil emulsions of savory, parsley and rosemary to evaluate their potential to protect against cardiovascular diseases.",544ec19b-c7b5-4299-b13c-bdb93d4e0c88
55,methods56," Furthermore, the combination of these essential oils could give rise to a synergistic beneficial effect higher than the one observed by each essential oil separately. Thus, our results pave the way for future translational studies assessing the minimal dose with the maximum effect and the potential toxic effect.  5. Conclusions  In summary, this study demonstrates that dietary supplementation of essential oils from parsley, savory and rosemary exert prebiotic effects by promoting or restoring beneficial bacteria populations in the gut of humanized mice with fecal transplantation from patients with Ischemic heart disease (IHD) and T2DM. These effects on gut microbiota caused a decrease in plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels and an increase in fecal SCFA levels. Interestingly, treatments with essential oil emulsions were associated with an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant profile.",459085d2-2b29-4735-b465-a0dae254269d
56,methods57," It is worth mentioning that rosemary essential oil was the most promising nutraceutical for the treatment and/or prevention of cardiovascular events. Moreover, this work displays novel evidence by which plant-derived essential oils, commonly used in the Mediterranean diet, promote health and protect against inflammation and oxidative stress typically observed in Ischemic heart disease (IHD) and/or T2DM. Further studies are warranted to validate our results in humans with the aim to modulate the gut microbiota and enhance biochemical biomarkers in patients with Ischemic heart disease (IHD) and T2DM.
