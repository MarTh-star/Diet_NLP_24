On the other side, I have a few suggestions and questions for clarification: What are the 150 samples, since it was about the 65 items selected?  I recommend adding the quantities of the ingredients used in the recipes of the meals selected in table 1, noting that the method of preparation and quantities can be different from one region to another.  I recommend adding a more recent reference to be based on in order to explain how the 30 items were selected.  Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?

Lebanon is an Arab country with a population of over six million 2 and is considered as part of the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Few data have discussed food attitudes and practices in Lebanon; however, recent evidence published in 2019 from two surveys enrolled previously between 1997 and 2008/2009, showed a shift in the Lebanese diet with regards to an expansion in energy intake from 1728 ± 24 kcal in 1997 to 1877 ± 15 kcal in 2008/2009 and dietary fat from 34.63 ± 0.32% in 1997 to 36.97 ± 0.",839bff3d-f639-46a0-809b-6ff17571be1a

No changes were reported with regards to protein and fiber intake 3. According to the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) statistics, the worldwide probability of premature death due to Noncommunicable Diseases (NCD)s accounts for 70% of the 41 million deaths each year. In Lebanon in 2016, 91% (10,334 individuals) of all deaths were due to Noncommunicable Diseases (NCD)s 4. Furthermore, among the 10,334 premature deaths from Noncommunicable Diseases (NCD)s, 27.2% of deaths were due to cancer.",a35e768d-bc8c-4dc6-9370-adaff96fa7f0

7,background3," Many factors influence meal planning for a healthy diet, of which food choices, personal preferences, ethnic behaviors and tradition may increase the responsibility and commitment of health care professionals and dietitians in promoting improved nutrition at an individual and community level, through adherence to food composition tables and exchange lists 7.  At the Middle Eastern level, there is a lack in regional and national exchange lists that incorporate traditional foods. The food exchange list 8, which helps in translating recipes into food serving sizes and energy intake, was designed to assist individuals in an easily operated and easily understood way in improving their healthy eating habits and in adhering to a healthy diet plan. In the food exchange list, foods available in the same category can be used reciprocally without any change in the quantities of macronutrients and energy yielded by a dish.",4be78bf6-5fdc-4fcb-b31f-5c5be6f9b575
8,background4," According to numerous sources, there is a need to add cultural relevance to food exchange lists to improve Noncommunicable Diseases (NCD) management 9, taking into consideration ethnic variations and traditions which may have enormous influence on individual and community health 10. Thus, the key success factor for improving health care professionals, dietitians and individuals’ adherence to healthy food choices is to design and implement culturally accepted exchange lists that add traditional dishes into their meal planning 7. Currently, Lebanese dietitians are using the American Dietetic Association exchange list to design meal plans. However, this exchange list is limited by a gap in traditional meals consumed in Lebanon. In spite of the availability of a few national food composition tables that involve a limited number of dishes common in Lebanese cuisine 11, 12, ingredients and preparation methods differed substantially across time and these are outdated.",15dc163b-042d-4b1a-9cbe-951987272663

24,methods14," Regarding traditional meals, five samples for each dish were collected previously from various regions of Lebanon and tested to eliminate any discrepancies 16. The laboratory analyses of the 150 samples showed, after being tested using Chi-square, no significant differences in all of the variables tested (p=0.4, data not shown) between different governorates in Lebanon. IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0 was the software used for analysis of the results.  Chemical analysis  After the receipt of the food samples, 500 g of each composite dish was mashed and then analyzed in the laboratory. The remaining samples were kept frozen at -18°C in tight containers for further analysis. According to the standard Association of Official Agricultural Chemists 17 procedures, components of the dishes such as ash, moisture, crude protein and crude fat were analyzed. Using thermal drying methods with a Fisher Isotemp vacuum oven, moisture was identified.",20fed6cf-3ff0-4246-81d2-4970f5f09295
25,methods15," The food samples were heated to 105°C and the measurement of moisture content was based on the loss of weight of the sample. According to the International Dairy Federation Standard, crude protein was calculated through the multiplication of 6.38 by total Kjeldahl nitrogen (AOAC 991.20-23) 17. Total fatty acid was analyzed by extraction with petroleum ether using the Soxhlet extraction system. The Roese-Gotlieb method was used in the investigation of the fat content (AOAC 945.48, 933.05 & 963.15, 2019) 17. To obtain ash, using an Isotemp muffle furnace, an oxidation of all organic matter in a weighed sample was achieved by incineration in a muffle furnace at 550°C overnight; then the weight of the remaining ash was measured. carbohydrate (CHO) was calculated by subtracting the sum of the percentages of the measured weights of fat, protein, moisture, and ash from the total weight (100g). Energy was expressed in kilocalories (kcal).",3b32835e-170a-474c-9270-23fbca7b777e
26,methods16," Using Atwater calorie conversion factors, calorie values were calculated based on the total grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate (CHO), as 4, 4, and 9 kcal/g respectively 18.  Development of exchange lists  The macronutrient exchanges were determined based on the laboratory values provided from the analysis of 100 g of each dish. Wheeler and collaborators (Wheeler et al. 1996) 19 described a round-off method which was used to yield exchange numbers. The macronutrient exchanges were calculated as follows:  carbohydrate (CHO) exchange. The dish was not considered as one serving if it contained 1–5 g carbohydrate. If the food portion contained 6–10 g carbohydrate (CHO), the dish was considered as half a serving and if it contained 11–20 g carbohydrate (CHO), it was considered as one serving.  Protein exchange. If the amount of protein ranged between 0–3 g in the meat and meat substitute dishes, it was not counted as a serving.",9563cd14-66fa-4896-9a2a-51a8d1368284
27,methods17," If it contained 4–10 g protein, it was considered as one serving.  Fat exchange. If the amount of fat in food portions ranged between 0–2 g, it was not considered as a serving. However, if the dish contained 3g of fat, it was counted as half a serving and if it contained between 4 and 7 g fat, it was counted as one serving. Moreover, the amount of the meal (in grams) that yielded one carbohydrate (CHO), one protein and one fat exchange was obtained by the calculation of carbohydrate (CHO) grams, protein grams, and fat grams by 15, 7, and 5, respectively.  Results and discussion  The results of the analysis of 100g from each dish and Arabic sweet are presented in Table 2.  Table 2.

The protein content was lowest in Baba Ghanouj (1.1 %) and highest in Shawarma Dajaj (29.7%). Hindbeh bi zeit, which is fried chicory with onions, contained the top increased fat content (22.4%) of the analyzed dishes and was greater than the 6.7 % shown previously in 1970 in Lebanon 11. Falafel, a fried dish, has the highest energy value (339 kcal/100 g). On the other hand, almost all the stews such as Yakhnet Bamia, Yakhnet Fassoulia and Yakhnet Mouloukhia have medium levels of energy ranging between 110 and 140 kcal per 100 g ( Table 2).",40a65304-8d3a-4b20-93a9-8ef0a40c73d4
29,methods23," On the other hand, although the amount of energy in the dishes was identical, the dissimilarity in protein, carbohydrate (CHO) or fatty acid content had nutritional implications on health, since a high intake of carbohydrate (CHO) or fats is associated with a high-risk factor for non-communicable diseases 5.  The nutrient goal represents the average intake that is compatible with the maintenance of good health in individuals 20. According to the US Food and Drug Administration (Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) definition, the daily value (DV) is described as the “reference values for reporting nutrients on the nutrition labels”. The percentage (%) of DV assists the consumer in recognizing how the serving of food, and its content in nutrients, fits into their daily diet. As per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, the expression “high,” “rich in,” or “excellent source of” nutrients are used if the food has ≥20% of the daily value per reference amount.",ce7a82d3-2c41-4436-9f6e-dfdde55d4c56
30,methods24," The terms “good source,” “contains,” or “provides” are used if the food yields 5–19% of the recommended dietary intake (recommended dietary intake (RDI)) per reference amount of the nutrient. Foods that carry <5% of the recommended dietary intake (RDI) from the nutrient per reference amount are considered to have low amounts. In our study, the contribution of each dish (per 100g) to the overall amount of carbohydrate (CHO), protein and fat needed per day was calculated. The calculations are presented in Table 2.  Pellet et al., in 1970, showed high total fatty acid content in Lahm bi ajin (39.4%) which was higher than the reported value of 8% in our study 11. There is limited available research on the composition of Lebanese traditional composite dishes, thus the results provided in this study were compared with data from other countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) 11, 21– 26, mainly the amount of total fatty acid content in these foods.",6000d310-23e3-4f14-8ef0-92904f079b9b
31,methods25," The amount of total fatty acid in the foods consumed in Lebanon, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and Saudi Arabia are extremely important given the elevated prevalence of non-communicable diseases in the countries ( Table 3) 26. Compared to our findings, increased fatty acid content was observed in Falafel that was also reported in many other Arab countries (14.3% in Saudi Arabia to 18.4% in Jordan) 23, 24. The fatty acid content in Baba Ghanouj was double the level described in Jordanian Baba Ghanouj (9.4% and 5.4%, respectively) 23 and triple the level reported previously in 1970 in the Lebanese Baba Ghanouj. Furthermore, the Kuwaiti Baba Ghanouj’s fatty acid content was moderately lower than that described in our study (8.7 and 9.4, respectively) 22.

The high fatty acid content of Fatayer Sabanikh was shown in almost all other studies enrolled in Arab countries; the content found in our findings was higher than all values reported in all countries ( Table 3). In our study, Fattoush contained lower fatty acid content compared to the same dish of Kuwait origin (2.94% and 2.17%, respectively) 22. In contrast, our results contradicted the values reported previously in Lebanon and in Jordan (6.3% and 8.6% respectively) 11, 23. Since Foul Moudamas is frequently consumed with added olive oil in Lebanon, thus, the availability of total fatty acids is high in this dish. The findings of our study show that the amount of fatty acid in Foul Moudamas was similar to those prepared in all the Arab countries except for Jordan 23. The values of fat in the remaining dishes are shown in Table 2.",751741b4-953b-4358-a236-637227c66dda

In addition, the serving size of each dish which would provide one exchange of each macronutrient was calculated ( Table 4). At least one exchange of starch was found in almost all dishes except Baba Ghanouj, Fattat homos, Fattoush, Hindbe bil zet, Loubia bil zet, Shawarma Dajaj, Shawarma Lahma, Yakhnet Mouloukhiya and Tabboula. The bean’s stew ( Yakhnet Fassoulia) contained the highest amount of carbohydrate (CHO) exchanges (1.5 exchanges). The highest numbers of fat exchanges are found in Mousaka Batinjan, Fatayer sabanikh and Hindbe bil zet ( Table 4).

The highest amount of protein was observed in Foustoukia (19.2%) and the lowest amount was in Moushabak (2.1%). Barazik, which is a sesame cookie cooked with butter, contains predominantly more than 40% of fat and had the highest energetic content (553 kcal/100 g). on the other hand, the least energy-dense foods were puddings ( Riz bi halib and Mohallabiya).",3cb005d2-669b-4fcc-bfa2-67c3ec2a4635
35,methods37,"  As stated before, there is a gap in the research field on the composition of Lebanese traditional composite dishes and Arabic sweets, thus our findings were compared with data from other countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) 11, 21– 26, mainly the amount of total fatty acid content in these sweets. Compared to our findings, the fatty acid content of Baklava in Lebanon did not differ to that in Jordan; however, it was lowest than the value reported in Bahrain. Lebanese Barazik, Ghourayba, Katayef Kashta, Maakaron and Moushabbak and Maamoul fostok had the highest fatty acid content compared to other EM countries ( Table 3).  The macronutrient exchanges yielded from the analysis of 100 g of each of the 35 types of Arabic sweets are shown in Table 4. In addition, the serving size of each dish which would provide one exchange of each macronutrient was calculated ( Table 4). At least one exchange of starch was found in all Arabic sweets .",4bfaaf96-d2c8-45b3-87df-7c950d6bff85
36,methods38," Barazik and Halawa contained the highest amount of fat exchanges (2 exchanges per serving). In addition, less than 5 g of protein per portion size was determined in all Arabic sweets ( Table 4). These exchange lists for traditional dishes and Arabic sweets will assist healthcare professionals and dietitians in organizing culturally appropriate planning of healthy food, especially for those with non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, for effective medical nutritional therapy, these exchange lists may assist in monitoring food portions for these traditional dishes. In addition, the chemical composition of traditional foods is highly necessary in order to investigate the dietary consumption of populations 25 and explore the impact of healthy food consumption on disease prevention 26.  The principal limitation of this study is that the dishes and Arabic sweets analyzed were commercially prepared and the dishes’ ingredients were not reported, only recipes.",1821bf41-07e8-4d5f-8197-945125258c06
37,methods39," Table 1 provides the ingredient quantities available from Lebanese cookbooks; however, all the relevant findings in our study were analyzed in an accredited laboratory. In addition, there are differences in ingredient proportions and cooking methods among various countries in the Arabian Middle Eastern and Gulf regions 22, 27.  Despite these limitations, this study provides healthcare professionals and consumers with an updated food composition table and a new exchange list of Lebanese traditional dishes and Arabic sweets consumed in Eastern Mediterranean countries by providing the laboratory composition of 30 frequently consumed traditional foods and 35 frequently consumed Arabic sweets. This can help improving diet quality, the achieving weight loss and implementing self-control in obese or overweight individuals and/or individuals with diabetes.",200d4f51-118f-4514-9e44-370f2418b454
38,methods40,"  Conclusions  To conclude, the Lebanese food exchange lists for the 30 frequently consumed Middle Eastern traditional dishes and the 35 mostly consumed Arabic sweets are now available 28. This guide is a good source of information about the macronutrient content of traditional dishes and Arabic sweets cooked in Lebanon. It is important to consumers, dietitians, and researchers and it offers accessible, user-friendly, practical models and uses household measures that allow consumers, dietitians and healthcare professionals to develop meal plans with healthier selections. Jordan, Syria and Palestine also can get the maximum benefit from this work because of the similarity in their traditional dishes. Finally, Lebanese cuisine offers a wide variety of recipes rich in micronutrients which could prevent the rise in Noncommunicable Diseases (NCD)s.",5bcdc25d-9c13-4fe6-8259-4436345c4e76
39,methods41," Thus, data on micronutrients in traditional dishes and Arabic sweets would be of greater importance in halting the rise of diet-related Noncommunicable Diseases (NCD)s in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Efforts like this will provide a solid framework for the implementation of nutrition policies and practices in the region.
