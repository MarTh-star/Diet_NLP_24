1,methods0," Between March and May 2021, we conducted a randomized controlled study on two phases among medical students at An-Najah National University. Data were collected using an online questionnaire and the Arabic version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We also used the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) tool to assess their Mediterranean Diet (MD) adherence. In the second phase, sixty-six students were recruited and assigned randomly to control and intervention groups. Intervention impact was assessed using 12-item General Health Questionnaire at two-time points; baseline, and 8 weeks post-intervention. The interventional model used was cognitive behavioral therapy, and the control group received no treatment. ",39fe82d9-5d44-4501-810e-9abc9d12abe2
2,analysis0," We used SPSS, version 21 to analyze the data. We set a 5% alpha level and 80% power in all of the statistical tests. We calculated the means and the standard deviations (SDs) for continuous variables, and percentages for categorical variables. To assess the categorical variables associated with depressive symptoms, we used the chi-squared test. We used the independent sample t-test to examine differences in the means of the continuous variables. We assessed the effects of the intervention on the outcome variables by calculating the percentage of mean change for each subject from pre-intervention to post-intervention then an independent t-test was employed to determine the difference in the mean of the percentage of the mean difference between the two groups.",8e41ba24-98b7-4816-8a87-f45601e7d573

9,discussion0," COVID-19 is a novel pandemic that has fatigued the lives of many people including students. Therefore, the novelty of the current study is that we targeted to estimate mental health problems among a sample of medical Palestinian students and investigate possible factors that might be related to developing mental health problems among them. We also aimed to examine the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral intervention on psychological problems among enrolled participants.  The impact of COVID-19 on mental health and its associated factors  Our findings suggest a considerable negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, as 91 (28%) students obtained a GHQ-15 score > 15 points. This is in line with a recent study that found students experienced significant psychological distress [50]. Our findings are also consistent with a former study conducted by Islam et al.",26a4e31c-fe79-4c0c-b01c-261adaca5d99
10,discussion1," [51] who noticed unfavorable psychological responses (stress, anxiety, and depression) during the COVID-19 outbreak among Bangladesh undergraduates.  Various factors that are relevant to the undergraduates’ category may affect mental health including familial factors, debt, economic difficulties, poor quality of life, job losses and unemployment, and lifestyle factors [52]. In the current study, we observed that poor mental health status was significantly associated with low physical activity. This is in keeping with other studies, which demonstrate that physical activity and mental health are associated proportionally and it bears a positive effect on the education of youth [53].  Consistent with the findings of our study, several studies showed that mental health is associated with sleeping duration, such as the study by Chang et al., which showed that short sleep duration (< 7 h/ night) is positively associated with elevated depressive symptoms [54].",9536099d-7ddf-49b9-8bc4-772c4d41b9be
11,discussion2," In contrast, two former studies found a U-shaped correlation between depressive symptoms and sleep duration [55, 56].  Though the mechanisms involved in the relationship between depressive symptoms and sleep duration are anonymous. First, people who sleep for a short period of time may have imperfect comfort and a higher perceived stress severity, which is considered a risk factor for depressive symptoms [57]. Second, former research found that university students who carry two alleles of low-expressing polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene had more depressive symptoms in the existence of a permanent pattern of short night sleep [58].  Our findings showed that there was a significant inverse relationship between mental health and screen entertainment. These findings were in a parallel line with former studies conducted by Thomée et al.",03139a9f-bac7-47db-8600-8bc02e0e48f6
12,discussion3," [59], and Chen [60], which showed that there is a correlation between addiction to mobile phones and mental health in dimensions of depression, psychosis, behavioral problems, and anxiety.  The role of the Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program on improving mental health symptoms among undergraduates  In terms of the second phase of the study, we found that the Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program intervention had an effective effect on GHQ- total score, depression and anxiety, and social dysfunction among Palestinian medical students. The findings also demonstrated that there is a significant difference in mean scores between intervention and control groups in total GHQ, depression, anxiety, and social dysfunction, while no significant difference was found in the loss of confidence. This points out that although students in the intervention group scored lower in loss of confidence, they were not different and did not do better than their counterparts in the control group.",dd461088-d1f4-492d-8d39-b69d0a1cce3f
13,discussion4,"  Nevertheless, the findings are consistent with the literature that supports the efficacy of Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating depression and anxiety in Parkinson’s disease patients [61]. Moreover, the current study builds on the preliminary findings of Hamdan and colleagues [41] who explored that using Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program lessened the depressive symptoms among Jordanian university students. The results of this investigation are also in accordance with a former study [62] which found that using Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) programs reduced the depressive symptoms among adolescents, and Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) had a higher impact on depression in comparison to other types of intervention.  Our findings should be interpreted with caution given the limitations of our study. Firstly, the study only included participants from one university which means that these results don’t exemplify all medical students in Palestine.",22dc7e09-c266-4c55-9982-f74f05ab098f
14,discussion5," Secondly, online assessments inherently carry bias and are less reliable. Nonetheless, our study is the first of its kind to estimate mental health problems and their associated factors among Palestinian medical students, moreover, it can be considered the first study in Palestine that discuss the efficacy of using cognitive-behavioral therapy program with university students having mental health problems. Future studies should be conducted on a larger and more representative sample for a better understanding of the effectiveness of the program.  Conclusion  The present study evaluated and measured the mental health of Palestinian medical students during the online learning period using the GHQ-12 questionnaire. We found that the prevalence of poor mental health status among our sample was 28%. Further analysis revealed that students’ mental health status is significantly associated with physical activity level, duration of sleeping, and entertainment time.",2cc1dbc4-db01-4d3a-af2b-da852c4bc747
15,discussion6," The study also provides research-based evidence of the effectiveness of using cognitive-behavioral therapy with university students in Palestine who have mental health problems. The study revealed a decrease in the level of total GHQ score, depression, anxiety, and social dysfunction. Future studies should estimate the sustainability of the impact of this intervention over time and determine if students need continuous support.
