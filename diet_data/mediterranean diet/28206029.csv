J Diabetes Res  (2016 ) 2016 :8264830 .10.1155/2016/8264830 26839898   In the last few decades, a higher frequency of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome has been registered, as a result of various dietary and evolutionary changes and modernizing influences (1, 2). Results suggest that insulin resistance could be considered a common pathogenic factor for all these conditions, which may be prevented and even counteracted by a healthy lifestyle that includes a correct diet (3–6). In this regard, an adjuvant action may be played by some nutraceuticals of proven beneficial effects, such as the polyphenols found in the extra-virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)), a peculiar component of Mediterranean diet, which has been proposed by many studies as a protective factor against several diseases (7).",7991772a-7313-48b0-aade-2d28e0c7a163
3,introduction12," In particular, the pro-active ingredient oleuropein and its derivative hydroxytyrosol have been widely investigated, demonstrating, even when tested as single compounds, many beneficial effects, either in vitro or in vivo, in experimental animal models (8–10). However, the amount of oleuropein in the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is too low to account for a significant role when assumed in the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Actually, the endogenous β-glucosidase liberated during the olive oil extraction process, hydrolyzes oleuropein giving rise to a series of degradation products, all of which are less hydrophilic than the original natural secoiridoids, and therefore more soluble in the oily matrix extracted from the drupes.",f2c8c07b-e94b-4db4-9fd0-b16f60576b87
4,introduction13," Thus, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is scarce in oleuropein and much more abundant in its degradation product, oleacein (11–13), whose lipophilicity suggests that this compound may survive to the acidic conditions of stomach and be available for absorption into the systemic circulation, where it may reach considerable concentration (from 1 to 18 µM), thereby making it one of the effectors of the nutritional and beneficial effects of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (14, 15).  At present, there are no data on the effects of oleacein on glucose/lipid metabolism when administered in association with a high-fat diet (high fat diet (HFD)). In the present study, we analyzed the effects of oral administration of oleacein in C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice fed with a high fat diet (HFD). Measure of body weight, glycemia, insulinemia, serum lipids, and histologic examination of liver tissue were performed after 5 weeks of oleacein treatment.",e0801e11-70f2-4a49-a574-2fad82bab3e1
5,introduction14, The same measurements were also performed after an additional 8 weeks’ treatment in animals that had become overweight. A mechanistic explanation of oleacein effects was investigated in liver tissue as well.  ,a45cb679-2845-4dfe-b01e-4d34ceca24d7
6,methods0,"Chemicals Oleuropein was extracted as reported previously (16) from olive leaves of Coratina cultivar of Olea europaea. The purity was determined by RP-HPLC and HRMS-ESI and compared with data reported in the literature (16). Oleacein is the dialdehydic form of oleuropein’s aglycone [2-(3,4-hydroxyphenyl) ethyl (3S,4E)-4-formyl-3-(2-oxoethyl) hex-4-enoate]. Oleacein was obtained as described elsewhere, via one-step semi-synthesis under microwave assisted aqueous Krapcho decarbomethoxylation of oleuropein (14).  Ethics Statement All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Italian (D.M. 116/92) and ECC regulations (O.J. of E.C.L 358/1 12/18/1986), after approval of the experimental protocol by the local Ethic Committee of the University “Magna Græcia” of Catanzaro. Every precaution was taken to minimize stress and the number of animals used in each series of experiments.",c2352749-6bd3-42ff-bd29-6bc79c99d89b
7,methods1,"  Animals and Study Design Five-week-old male C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice (n = 28), normocaloric diet (TD. 2018), and high fat diet (HFD) (TD. 06414) were purchased from Envigo RMS S.r.l. Mice were maintained in 12-h light/dark cycle at 21 ± 1°C and 50 ± 5% humidity with free access to water and food ad libitum. Initially, 28 animals were randomized in four groups: mice fed with normocaloric diet (normocaloric diet (NCD), n = 8), mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) (high fat diet (HFD), n = 12), and mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) with a daily oral gavage of 20 mg/kg of oleacein (high fat diet (HFD)-OLEAC, n = 4) or oleuropein (high fat diet (HFD)-OLE, n = 4) for 5 weeks. In the second set of experiments, eight mice from the initial high fat diet (HFD) group were divided into two groups and continued to receive the high fat diet (HFD) without (high fat diet (HFD) group, n = 4) or with a daily oral gavage of 20 mg/kg of oleacein (high fat diet (HFD)-OLEAC group, n = 4) for additional 8 weeks.",ae306320-a79f-455d-8934-40da9e494c86
8,methods2," At the end of treatments (5 and 13 weeks in the two sets of experiments, respectively), animals were sacrified through cervical dislocation after 12 h overnight fasting. The whole liver, abdominal fat, heart, kidney, lung, and spleen were excised, weighted, and stored in liquid nitrogen, or washed in normal saline solution and immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l.). Body weight, food, and energy intake were recorded at weekly interval (17). In particular, body weight was analyzed as repeated measures. Insulin tolerance test (Insulin tolerance test (ITT)) was performed in normocaloric diet (NCD), high fat diet (HFD), and high fat diet (HFD)-OLEAC mice, as previously described (18). Insulin (1 U/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally into 12 h-fasted animals, and blood glucose levels were measured after 0, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min using an automatic glucometer (Glucocard Menarini).",a9f9964c-4633-46ba-ae9e-874b53c0c5f0
9,methods3,"  Biochemical Analysis Blood samples were collected after 12 h overnight fasting and glucose levels were then measured using a glucometer. Serum was obtained by centrifugation at 1,700 g for 10 min at room temperature and stored at −80°C until use. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides (Abcam), and fasting insulin (EMD Millipore Corporation) were measured using commercial kits, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described (19, 20). Approximate insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment [homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)], using the following formula: [glucose (mg/dl) × insulin (mU/l)/405] (21).  Protein Extraction and Western Blotting Total proteins were extracted from liver tissue, homogenizing the samples in modified RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.",7ed6baf5-3c37-482a-bbc8-0b0196c2fd9b

Protein expression was measured using the following specific antibodies: anti-sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (sterol response element binding proteins (SREBP)-1; 1:500); anti-extracellular regulated MAP kinase (ERK; 1:1,000) and anti-phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204 p-ERK; 1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-fatty acid synthase (FAS; 1:1,000) (Cell Signaling Technology); and anti-GAPDH (1:40,000) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Western blot (WB) detection system ECL Plus (Perkin Elmer) was used to visualize the immune complexes (24).",912ae6b1-a7e1-404a-bcdc-e062e9d8f278
11,methods5,  Histopathological Study Hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed according to the standard methods for histological assessment under light microscopy for toxicological analysis. Steatosis evaluation was performed by count of the percentage of vacuolated cells. A numerical score was assigned to each section on the basis of the percentage of vacuolated cells calculated for each mouse liver: 1 = 1–25%; 2 = 30–65%; 3 = >70%.  Statistical Analysis Data are expressed as mean ± SD and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 statistical software (GraphPad Software Inc.). Significant differences were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey multiple comparison test (25). p-Values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. ,ecfe6f9c-974a-485e-9bb0-b1ae1813f606
12,results0,"Effects of Oleacein on Body Weight and Biochemical Parameters The effects of oleacein or oleuropein (20 mg/kg each) were first analyzed in high fat diet (HFD) fed mice, following a 5-week treatment period. An increase in body weight was observed in high fat diet (HFD) mice as compared to the normocaloric diet (NCD) group, and this increase was primarily due to visceral fat accumulation (Figures 1A,B). Body weight in high fat diet (HFD) mice was significantly higher than all other groups (Figure 1A), thereby indicating a preventive action of oleacein (and its precursor oleuropein, used herein as a positive control) on body weight enhancement. No changes were noted in food and energy intake, or water intake when oleacein-high fat diet (HFD) treated mice were compared weekly with oleacein-untreated high fat diet (HFD) mice under standard housing during this study (Table 1). Also, during the experimental period, no signs of suffering or behavioral changes were noted among animal groups.",39e25245-4cc2-4688-b8b9-7627c1713a4d
13,results1," The biochemical parameters analyzed after this time period showed that, in the high fat diet (HFD) group of animals, a typical picture of high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic alterations was present, including hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (Figure 2), with an increase in serum levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides (Figure 3). Administration of oleacein counteracted these effects, inducing changes in all these parameters, and resulting even stronger than oleuropein in reducing insulin levels (Figures 2 and 3), and in amelioreting insulin sensitivity, as documented by both HOMA-IR and Insulin tolerance test (ITT) (Figure 2).

17,results5," WB analyses with liver protein extracts showed a reduction in the expression of sterol response element binding proteins (SREBP)-1 and FAS, as well as in p-ERK in the high fat diet (HFD) group of mice treated with either oleacein or oleuropein, suggesting a role for these enzymes/molecular targets as potential mediators of the effects of these compounds (Figure 4C).

Effects of Oleacein on Mice With Established Obesity In a second set of experiments, we investigated the effects of oleacein on already overweight mice. To this end, eight animals from the high fat diet (HFD) group (mean weight of 37.6 ± 0.6 g) continued to be fed with high fat diet (HFD) while receiving or not receiving the same dose of oleacein for further 8 weeks. Once again, a reduced increase in body weight was observed in oleacein-treated mice (Figure 6A), mainly due to a lesser increase in liver tissue (Figure 6B), and, to a lesser extend, to abdominal fat (Figure 6C).",f2eece04-8941-4333-8051-f766049bfbec
20,results8," As shown in Figure 7, only total cholesterol levels were significantly corrected by oleacein, whereas levels of tryglicerides were not affected, and glycemia was only slightly modified. Also, oleacein reduced lipid deposits in the liver (Figure 8A), and this reduction paralleled the decrease in p-ERK and sterol response element binding proteins (SREBP)-1 protein expression (Figure 8B), a condition that could contribute to ameliorating hyperinsulinemia in high fat diet (HFD) oleacein-treated mice (Figure 8C).

23,results11,"  Therefore, altogether, these data indicate that the improvement in insulin sensitivity in oleacein-treated mice, together with changes in some hepatic molecular targets of insulin, along with the reduction in visceral fat, may provide, at least in part, a possible explanation as to how oleacein can prevent weight gain in high fat diet (HFD) fed mice. Studies for a more detailed mechanistic explanation in this direction are in progress. ",36f8e598-01d6-4e87-a9d7-fe50f1f7ea55
24,discussion0,"The negative influence of excessive body fat on insulin action and hepatic function, leading to peripheral insulin resistance, has been widely demonstrated, indicating that a direct link does exist between obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and atherosclerosis (26, 27). Thus, in all these conditions, changes in the lifestyle, including dietary and nutritional changes, still represent the first-line therapeutic approaches (26, 27). A wide number of studies have been performed on the effects of nutraceutical compounds or other food components. Among these, the well-known protective properties of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-related compounds, key components of Mediterranean diet, have encouraged the investigation of mixtures of phenolic extracts from olive drupes or leaves or single compounds, such as oleuropein and its derivate hydroxytyrosol, both in vitro and in vivo experimental model systems (8–10).",cb11d5d7-d6ce-4a40-b312-118f0104896b
25,discussion1,"  We have previously reported the beneficial properties of in vivo administration of oleuropein, showing its protective effect against the high-fat cafeteria diet-induced body weight gain and hepatic steatosis, and a lower increase of cholesterol and glucose levels with improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity (17). Prevention of high fat diet (HFD)-induced adiposity and the hepatoprotective action of oleuropein in mice were also reported in other studies, in which oleuropein supplementation was able to modulate the expression of a variety of liver and adipose specific genes involved in the oxidative stress, lipid detoxification, and inflammation (28–31).  In the present study, we tested the effects of oleacein as obtained by using a simple and environmental friendly method, starting from the easily available natural oleuropein (16).",45d9b4a7-fa76-41f1-9986-8b02a5f13608
26,discussion2," This compound, which is the real oleuropein derivative present in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), displays antioxidant and antiflogistic properties, when used at a concentration comparable with that found in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (15, 32). Here, we show that oral administration of 20 mg/kg/day of oleacein exerts a protective, beneficial effect on several high fat diet (HFD)-related metabolic alterations, including a reduction in the body weight increase due to minor increment of fat in the abdominal visceral adipose tissue, as well as a significant decrease of macroscopic and microscopic steatosis. In addition, the association of oleacein treatment with lower levels of serum lipids, and partial correction of high plasma glucose levels, without increasing plasma insulin levels, is compatible with a role for oleacein in improving insulin sensitivity, which was confirmed by Insulin tolerance test (ITT).",24ce5f21-33c8-4208-851a-9f3ff6c4f8ba
27,discussion3," Our opinion in this regard is that oleacein, by ameliorating insulin sensitivity and reducing circulating insulin levels, can prevent metabolism dysfunction and weight gain. This explanation is supported by the finding that visceral fat (strongly linked to insulin resistance and metabolic disease) was significantly reduced in oleacein-high fat diet (HFD)-treated mice, as compared to oleacein-untreated high fat diet (HFD) mice. As an endocrine organ, adipose tissue produces a variety of local and systemic factors that regulate food intake, insulin sensitivity, and energy homeostasis. By disrupting the proper balance and function of these factors, fat expansion promotes insulin resistance (33). Therefore, based on the data obtained in our study, the mechanism for preventing weight gain in oleacein-treated mice may be related to the amelioration of insulin resistance and the prevention of metabolic dysfunction.",01ade374-2b6a-492a-9da2-8043b71ddec8
28,discussion4," Weight loss related to improved insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity has been reported in diet-induced obese rats in which changes in the size of adipocytes and reduction in fat tissue were observed (34). An alternative, unexplored hypothesis, compatible with our findings, is that oleacein, like metformin (35), the first-line drug for treatment of insulin-resistant diabetes, may act by increasing energy expenditure, thus preventing weight gain. As a limit of this study, we currently cannot perform calorimetric measurements, so that future investigation is needed to validate this possibility.  Furthermore, for the first time in this study, we have identified some of the molecular constituents that appear to be involved in oleacein action, including some known regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism.",dce245df-c695-4434-a956-36c49711fda5
29,discussion5," Indeed, the levels of the transcriptional activator sterol response element binding proteins (SREBP)-1 and its target FAS, key factors regulating the relative contribution of liver and adipose tissue to lipogenesis (36–42), were increased in the liver of high fat diet (HFD) mice and were reduced significantly following treatment of animals with oleacein. Protection from liver damage correlated also with the inhibition, in liver tissue, of the p-ERK, a condition that has been recently associated with amelioration of insulin resistance in rat liver (43). Some of these studies also reported the association of such hepatic markers with reduction of the weight gain determined by phenolic compounds (30, 31).  Our findings from our second set of experiments, in which oleacein was administrated in already obese animals, showed that oleacein was able to counteract only partially some of the adverse effects of high fat diet (HFD).",b5091873-3266-4566-8f21-4da846847626
30,discussion6," Among them, a reduced increase in body weight and liver mass, with reduced lipid infarction of the liver. Additional beneficial effects included the decrease of cholesterol levels, whereas hyperglycemia and triglyceridemia were not fully corrected, thus indicating that no real curative effect of oleacein can be observed under this condition.  Overall, our findings well support the efficacy of oleacein in preventing body weight gain and insulin resistance in high fat diet (HFD) fed mice. Also, they provide a partial mechanistic molecular explanation of how oleacein may act at the level of the liver, one of the most important target tissues of insulin action.",b24ef013-b830-4b6b-a19a-5a8ffc2fdd8b
31,discussion7," Given that no significant changes were observed in food intake or behavioral signs over the duration of the study, the improvement in insulin resistance in oleacein-treated mice (underlined by the parallel changes in some hepatic molecular targets of insulin), may partially explain the effect of oleacein in preventing weight gain in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. A minor impact of oleacein was observed when obesity was already established, making it harder to counteract some of the obesity-related metabolic damages. Confirmation of the beneficial effects of oleacein in humans is necessary to consider this compound as an adjuvant to the diet in the prevention and treatment of obesity and obesity-related insulin resistance.
