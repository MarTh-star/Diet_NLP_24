1,background0," A Mediterranean-style diet pattern (Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP)) is a recommended diet pattern in the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Few studies report widespread adherence to the diet, which suggests Americans may benefit from strategies to help them improve alignment to an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP).  Objectives  The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of isocaloric food substitutions on adherence to an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) in US adults.

2,methods0," Participants and data sets  This cross-sectional analysis used 12 years (2007–2018) of data from the NHANES (25). Since 1999, the CDC has continuously conducted this ongoing, population-based survey, which employs a complex, stratified, multistage probability sample design to create a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized, civilian US population (20). Each survey consists of questionnaires (e.g., sociodemographic, physical activity, sedentary levels, supplement use, etc.) administered in the home by trained personnel, followed by a standardized health examination conducted in person. NHANES dietary data are assessed via two 24-hour recalls. The first recall is conducted in person, with the second collected via phone interview within 3–10 days following the first recall. The final analytic sample consisted of 19,978 adult participants between the ages of 25–65 with two 24-hour diet recalls that were deemed reliable by meeting established criteria by the trained interviewer.",c0f78185-4736-4f99-a927-2553ab142f86
3,methods1," Developed by the USDA, the public-use Food Patterns Equivalents Databases (Food Patterns Equivalents Databases (FPED)) used in the current study is based on NHANES dietary recall data (26). The Food Patterns Equivalents Databases (FPED) uses the USDA food pattern definitions as referenced by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). These food pattern definitions provide calorie-based dietary guidance on how much Americans should eat from each of the food pattern components, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, dairy, and oils, to have a healthful diet, while simultaneously placing limits on the amounts of added sugars, solid fats, and alcoholic drinks that can be consumed.",46177e8b-11ad-4c12-afa5-44845c76b222
4,methods2," The conversion of foods and beverages in the USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (27), which provides nutrient compositions of all individual foods and beverages, into 37 USDA food pattern components is reported in the form of food pattern equivalents in the Food Patterns Equivalents Databases (FPED). Many of the foods in the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies, such as pizza, sandwiches, and casseroles, consist of ingredients that are from more than 1 food pattern component. These multi-ingredient foods are disaggregated to ingredients that can be assigned to a food pattern component before computing the amount of food pattern equivalents present in the food.",941fa580-9b76-4d61-8eaf-25ad84e349ca
5,methods3," The food pattern components are subsequently defined as the numbers of cup equivalents of fruit, vegetables, and dairy; ounce equivalents of grains and protein foods; teaspoon equivalents of added sugars; and number of alcoholic drinks, with 1 oz and 1 cup equivalents (eq) translating to 1 serving of each respective food component (26).  Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score  Among the many scoring indices designed to quantify adherence to the Mediterranean diet (28), the current study utilized a scoring index developed by Rumawas et al. (13), as it offered critical advantages over the other criterion-based scoring indexes. This scoring index, called the Mediterranean-style dietary pattern score (Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score), accounts for overconsumption of foods and for foods not identified as part of the Mediterranean diet, 2 characterizations of a typical American diet (29).",9d25c576-0b1b-4cfc-93d6-f105707a74e6
6,methods4,"  Calculation of Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score  The Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scoring index is based on recommended intakes of 13 food group components from the Mediterranean diet pyramid (10, 13, 30). With the exception of olive oil, scores for the remaining 12 food components are on a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 10, with 10 meaning the recommended intake amount was met per the Mediterranean diet pyramid. First, the average intake by day for each Mediterranean diet food component was calculated by averaging the Food Patterns Equivalents Databases (FPED) data across the two 24-hour recalls collected in the NHANES. Next, the component's average intake by day was multiplied by a designated number of points based on recommended intake amounts in the Mediterranean diet pyramid.",169b991e-f5ba-41f7-b258-b30ab35a2735
7,methods5," The 12 Mediterranean diet food components were assigned a specific number of points, so that a maximum score of 10 would be attained if the recommended number of servings per day—or, in the current study's case, the average intake per day—were met. The components were assigned points as follows: whole grains, 1.25 points; fruits, 3.33 points; vegetables, 1.67 points; dairy, 5.00 points; wine for men, 3 points, and wine for women, 1.5 points; fish or seafood, 11.69 points; poultry, 17.5 points; olives, legumes, and nuts, 17.5 points; potatoes and starchy vegetables, 23.31 points; eggs, 23.31 points; sweets and added sugars, 23.31 points; and meat, 70.00 points. For example, if a person consumed 2 servings per day of fruit (2 cup eq) and 2 servings per week of meat, their respective pre-component scores would be 6.66 and 140.00.",033fa502-0bdc-406b-a3d2-f22377817228
8,methods6," Overconsumption was then addressed by calculating how much the pre-component score exceeded the recommended amount (as a percentage) and then systematically subtracting a point for each number of servings overconsumed. For example, if a person exceeded their whole grain intake amount by 20%, then the whole grain component score would equal 8. A component score may equal 0 if the intake exceeds the recommendation by >100%, as in the preceding example of consuming 2 servings per week of meat. The olive oil component is measured categorically as exclusive use of olive oil with no other animal fats or vegetable oils used (score of 10), the use of olive oil in combination with other vegetable oils and/or animal fats (score of 5), or no olive oil use and use of other animal fat or vegetable oils exclusively (score 0).  Scores for all 13 components were summed and standardized to a 0–100 scale by dividing the total sum by 130 (the theoretical maximum sum).",ee70ad23-0094-443f-8b11-f54551920053
9,methods7," This scoring index is tailored for non-Mediterranean populations by using a weighting factor (0–1), to account for typical Mediterranean foods to non-Mediterranean foods. Each food consumed was systematically categorized as an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) food compared with a non-Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) food (13, 31), from which a proportion of the total energy of non-Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) foods to the total energy of Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) foods was derived. For example, if a person consumed 60% of their total energy from non-Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) foods, then the weighting factor would be 0.40. The standardized sum of the 13 components multiplied by the weighting factor is final calculation step. A higher total Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score indicates higher adherence to the Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) (range, 1–100).",f66f5f7c-835f-4713-80cb-d03dbb5f722f
10,methods8,"   Figure 1 depicts an illustration of the basic steps to calculate the total Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score.  FIGURE 1 Calculation of Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score. Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP), Mediterranean-style diet pattern.  Adherence levels for identification of foods for substitutions  The distribution of total Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scores among all participants was examined to create an adherence level categorization variable. Those who fell in quartile 1 (top 25%) of total Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scores were categorized as the high-adherence group (HA), while those in quartiles 2–4 constituted the remaining 75% and were categorized as the non-high-adherence group (nHA). The authors hypothesized the food substitutions should come from the food groups where the HA average intakes were both significantly different from the nHA and aligned with the proportions as guided by the Mediterranean diet pyramid.",e9e082ed-70a3-494e-83cf-99c02e5f4b2e
11,methods9," In other words, the foods from these food groups would have the greatest potential to positively impact Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scores, especially among the nHA.  The final list of foods to be used as the substitutions were partial use of olive oil, a serving of whole fruit, a serving of whole grain, a serving of fish or seafood, and a serving of nonstarchy vegetables. Next, comparable isocaloric foods among the nHA were identified via calorie matching using the USDA's FoodData Central (32). To determine appropriate isocaloric substitutions, the caloric density of 1 serving of each Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) food was compared to that of non-Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) foods within 1 of the food pattern components in the Food Patterns Equivalents Databases (FPED) that was overconsumed.",90fc0656-a9f1-4d08-855f-573cf042cd15
12,methods10," For example, to add fish in substitution for red meats, which were both considered protein foods in the Food Patterns Equivalents Databases (FPED), 4 oz of Atlantic salmon is approximately 162 calories and 4 oz of 93% lean ground beef is approximately 172 calories. In a 1-to-1 substitution in which calories were within a small margin between the 2 foods, there were no multipliers applied. However, in the substitutions in which 1 serving was not calorically equal to that of the other item, multiple servings (i.e., 2.5) were applied in the substitution modeling.  Isocaloric substitution modeling  The current study utilizes an adapted isocaloric substitution modeling process (15, 19, 33) to determine whether simple isocaloric substitutions may help improve adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as measured by the Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score (e.g., outcome of interest).",14fba2f6-3817-4077-9055-5757ccd397a2
13,methods11," The broad concept behind isocaloric substitutions is relatively simple, yet with complex statistical considerations (15, 19): what is the impact on an outcome of interest when an increased intake of a given food is balanced by a decreased intake of another, calorically comparable food? Following identification of the isocaloric pairs of food, systematic calculations ensured individual substitutions would only be applied to participants who met the minimum level of intake for the specific food to be substituted. For example, only those participants who reported consumption of at least 4.0 oz eq of red, processed, or organ meat had 4.0 oz eq of fish or seafood added to their fish or seafood intake amount, balanced by 4.0 oz eq subtracted from their red, processed, or organ meat intake amounts. The presubstitution mean total Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score for each adherence group was calculated.",97fd00d9-fea0-4704-948e-572503366fba
14,methods12," For each individual substitution, a postsubstitution mean total Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score was calculated and reported by adherence group. The same iterative modeling process was performed, but with multiple isocaloric substitutions added to 1 model to assess for an additive effect on Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scores. The simplicity of each individual isocaloric substitution makes it reasonable that multiple isocaloric substitutions may be implemented over a short period of time (e.g., 1 week).  Substitution modeling using honey-food pairing recipes  A substitution analysis using the methods described above assessed the impact on total Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scores after adding a serving of honey to the substitutions in the form of recipes. Three easy-to-follow recipes were devised using the 5 isocaloric swaps paired with honey.",e2942612-74a9-44f5-8d12-42172ada07fa
15,methods13," For example, the substitutions of fruit and a leafy green salad were combined in the recipe of a kale and strawberry salad with olive oil and honey dressing. Each recipe was nutritionally analyzed to determine a reasonable isocaloric swap as described above, but with additional energy (kcal) from the honey factored into the Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scoring algorithm as the added sugar and sweets food component (see Table 1). To reiterate, the honey-food pairing recipe was substituted if the participant met the minimum level of intake for the specific food(s) to be substituted. In the same example, if the participant had a minimum intake of 2 oz eq of starchy vegetables and 2.45 tsp eq of added sugar in the form of fruit juice, then the substitution recipe of 4 oz of leafy greens and 0.75 cup eq of whole fruit plus the serving of honey (1 tsp of added sugar) would be applied.

Differences by adherence group across demographic and BMI status characteristics were determined by a chi-square test using PROC SURVEYFREQ. The following characteristics that significantly differed were included as cofactors in the multiple regression models: age, gender, race, education, and BMI. Multiple regression analyses using PROC SURVEYREG determined differences by adherence group for the following continuous dietary outcome variables: total Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score, the 12 component scores, and average intake per day amounts (cup or ounce equivalents).

The tabbouleh honey-food pairing recipe had the most positive effect, with an ∼21% increase (+3.5 points) for the HA and a 38% increase (+2.7 points) for the nHA, followed by the leafy green with olive oil and honey dressing honey-food pairing recipe (HA: +2.7 points; nHA: +2.2 points). The recipe for fish with a honey, herb, and olive oil marinade had the smallest positive impact (HA: +2.5 points; nHA: +2.0 points).",e0a00998-1586-4df9-b252-bcc0788b0eba

34,discussion0," The current study offers evidence that the vast majority of American adults fall short in following an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP), despite it being 1 of 3 dietary patterns recommended in the last 2 iterations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). The popularity of an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP), as indicated by the large number of reports that span both science and current news publications (36–39), presents a conundrum for public health nutrition when juxtaposed against our findings. The present study provides empirical data in support of a strategy that uses simple substitutions the average American can implement in their eating habits to help increase their adherence to an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP).  The current study found even lower adherence to an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) in comparison to the few studies among US populations in the extant literature. Rumawas et al. (13) determined greater adherence (mean score: 24.",1e3fff85-b965-4393-a13a-484607b7e447
35,discussion1,"8) using the same scoring system in a cohort of Americans whose previous generation(s) participated in the Framingham Heart Study. As such, selection bias may have been present, because participating offspring may have been informed of a family history of cardiovascular disease or related chronic conditions and, therefore, may have already been following a more heart-healthy dietary pattern. Unlike the nationally representative sample used in the current study, the Framingham Heart Study is based in the northeastern region of the United States. Chen et al. (11) found that 46.5% of their study participants had high adherence (scoring from 5–9 out of 9 points) using an FFQ among 20,897 Americans. The top 25% of scorers in the current study had a mean score of 16.45 (out of 100). Direct comparison to the Chen et al. (11) study proves problematic given the significant differences in study methodologies. For example, data were assessed in the Chen et al.",4fb4085b-8217-4633-b335-02a1deb789ac
36,discussion2," (11) study using an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scoring system that did not mention accounting for overconsumption of “detrimental” foods (i.e., added sugars). Our findings provide clear evidence that Americans have patterns of overconsumption, especially in the non-high-adherence group, that may negate the effects of achieving the desired quantity of “beneficial” foods in an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP). The Chen et al. (11) cohort was also restricted to those ≥45 years of age. Older Americans have been found to have healthier dietary patterns in previous ecological studies (40). Finally, the information obtained from 24-hour recalls, compared to FFQs, has been found to more closely align with intake as measured by the doubly labeled water method (41).",a5a789fb-14ca-43ca-8044-86ffd7cbfab5
37,discussion3,"  In assessing adherence to an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP), the current study offers supplemental guidance to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) to show how much Americans continue to overconsume certain food groups (42). Considering a score of 10 for each food group equates meeting the recommend Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) amounts, the HA and nHA mean scores for meat (0.39 ± 0.04 and 0.17 ± 0.01, respectively) and added sugars (0.14 ± 0.02 and 0.04 ± 0.01, respectively) illustrate a critical need for improvement. These numbers translate to alarming overconsumption, especially for the nHA. Similar results were previously reported, with 91.4% of participants exceeding the recommendations for meat and 90.7% overconsuming added sugar (13). Our results also show poultry and eggs are popularly consumed protein sources in American diets, but not to the same degrees of overconsumption as red meats and added sugars.",d009f7f5-2ab4-40a2-8412-7b4aa4856681
38,discussion4," Industry data support these findings, reporting average per capita consumption of poultry between 2007–2018 at 102.1 pounds (43) and a 15% increase in per capita egg consumption since 2007 (44). The mean scores for nuts and legumes were also indicative of overconsumption, at 3.17 ± 0.09 in the HA and 0.74 ± 0.09 in the nHA, although not to the degrees relative to meat and added sugars. This could be attributed to the growth in popularity of plant-based diets (45) and the wider availability of plant-based products in the market (46). Future interventions to increase Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) adherence can use the present study's results to inform strategies to reduce intakes for certain food groups.  Less than ideal average intakes per day were also present for other Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) food groups, including whole grains, nonstarchy vegetables, fish, and olive oil.",17ce771a-2fe9-4ec8-9ab5-aeb94c5fc944
39,discussion5," When juxtaposed against a 36% increase in whole grains in US food products since 2008 (47), whole grain intakes are low, especially among the nHA, with reported consumption of 0.65 oz eq per day (Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) component score = 0.79 out of 10). The 75% of the study population making up the nHA achieved a total vegetable intake of ∼1 cup eq, which is lower than the 2–3 cups per day recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). Lee et al. (48) found an even smaller proportion of their study population (10%) met the same Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) benchmark, making the 6 cups per day recommendation of the Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) even more challenging to achieve. Fruit consumption fared only slightly better among the HA, whose average intake (1.50 ± 0.05 cup eq) was within range of meeting the 1.",75b51494-1f3f-4bf9-908f-cf1c89d190e4
40,discussion6,"5–2 cup recommendation set by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) (39) but still fell short of the 3-cup Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) recommendation. The proportion of those who reported any use of olive oil in the HA was much greater than that in the nHA (6.8% compared with 0.7%, respectively). Rumawas and colleagues (13) found that 37% of their study population exclusively used olive oil, thereby dwarfing the current study's reported ∼3.3% of the total population for the same level of olive oil use. The differentiation is likely attributable to the difference in data collection of a 24-hour recall compared with an FFQ. Careful consideration needs to be applied when measuring olive oil use in future research. The aforementioned food groups are emphasized in an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) and are, therefore, critical to include in the diet substitutions.",8235e795-d463-4324-9b65-8e79d8e1da1a
41,discussion7," The wine intake results suggested a favorable contribution to the average American's Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) adherence. However, the authors focused only on foods for the substitutions, considering wine is a limited Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) item (10).  Using foods that are already part of the average American diet underscores widespread acceptability to elicit behavior change. That is, first determining which foods differed between high and lower adherence groups clarifies which foods may be most predictive of improved alignment and, thus, optimal for the substitutions. A recent study assessing factors that determine high compared with low adherence to dietary prescriptions noted participants were more likely to continue to make dietary substitutions to nutrient-dense options 6 months after a diet intervention than they were to follow a diet prescription (49).",1a6248d3-f14e-483c-9d4b-535ee0c6a35e
42,discussion8," Further research would need to confirm whether these foods have the potential to be accepted by the broader population. The substitution that made the greatest impact on Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scores was increasing olive oil use, which makes sense given the vast majority of the study population (98%) reported no olive oil use. Research widely supports exclusive olive oil use as the most representative component of the Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP), as well as the most impactful component for cardiovascular health (50) and successful aging (51). This simple substitution increased total mean Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score for the nHA by over 2 points, and over 2.5 points for the HA, as shown in Table 5."" THEN move this revised sentence before Research widely supports exclusive olive oil use as the most representative.",0646ce00-bdbf-41d3-8d15-e6474ee39bde
43,discussion9," The finding that the fish or seafood substitution did not positively impact the Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score suggests the HA was closer to meeting the ideal number of servings. Practicing nutritionists and clinicians may find this information helpful in tailoring substitutions for their patients.  The effects of the number of dietary substitutions on the Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scores provided compelling results with practical implications for dietary behavior changes. An additive effect on Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scores was shown with multiple substitutions. The ease and practicality of 1–3 simple food swaps within 2 days makes it a promising strategy to try. Although 3 swaps could be deemed manageable, more research is needed to determine a point of saturation.",7c0a776d-3e0f-44ff-b82e-85bee25560ee
44,discussion10," That is, is there an optimal number of substitutions that would produce an increase in Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scores? If there is an optimal number of substitutions, the concept of a specific number of food substitutions could be backed by the behavior change notion of implementation intentions. Implementation intentions specify the where, when, and how of goal setting, thereby increasing the likelihood that the goal will be accomplished compared to intentions that merely specify a desired end state (52). Our study's identification of the food groups and amounts needed each simple swap outlines the specifics that may better equip a person to meet their goal of following an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP).  The positive effects of the honey-food pairing substitutions on Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scores support increased consideration of palatability in the strategy of simple swaps. The taste of some foods (e.g.",4de27a70-e075-4068-b01d-e6114eb94126
45,discussion11,", vegetables and whole grains) sometimes conflicts with an innate preference for sweets (53, 54). The honey-food pairing recipes were directly informed by the isocaloric substitution modeling results. For example, olive oil was used as a base for the honey-food pairing recipes, given the magnitude of impact of the simple olive oil substitution. The ubiquity of olive oil in culinary practice and utilizing recipes that contain olive oil as a base has the potential to impact a wide audience. A potential concern was that the increase to the added sugar component would negate a positive effect on Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scores. The results show only a marginal difference in Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scores compared to the substitutions without honey. Interventions testing differences in acceptance between the simple substitutions with and without honey may be worthy of further exploration.",390745d3-3d7a-4640-b1e4-d9004aaaa48b
46,discussion12," Because our study used a nationally representative sample, the results suggest a range from 25% to 99% of if Americans in most need of improvement, could see a meaningful increase could see a meaningful increase in Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) adherence by incorporating just 3 honey-food substitutions in their diet.  This present study has multiple strengths that support its contribution to a better understanding of dietary substitutions in large populations. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use NHANES data to show the majority of Americans diets do not align with an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP). NHANES provides a large and reliable sample and uses a multiple-pass system for dietary recalls, creating high statistical power.",c2ae037d-ab66-46f9-9893-9a37cb50bb4e
47,discussion13," The Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scoring system developed by Rumawas and colleagues (13) offered a number of advantages over other Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) scoring indices that made it more appropriate for non-Mediterranean cultures throughout the world. Other studies constructed scores based on the Mediterranean diet pyramid, but did not consider the recommended intakes assigned to each food group and, thus, reflected dietary patterns of the study population rather than adherence to the Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) (55, 56). Moreover, previous scoring indices did not consider the negative implications of overconsumption. As a result, adherence to the Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) may have been achieved by simply consuming greater amounts of food (57). This aspect may be particularly relevant to American cohorts, where overconsumption of foods may be more common and failure to account for it may result in confounding by energy intake.",01ea7f57-1184-437b-b9b8-8b4269269205
48,discussion14,"  The current study's results should be considered against its potential limitations. Because there is no universally accepted scoring index to measure Mediterranean diet adherence, the limitations of the chosen system would apply to the results of current study as well. For example, in calculating the Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score, in order to attain the maximum of 10 for each food component, the recommended amounts of each food component were absolute values, which may not fully align with language often used regarding intake amounts set forth by dietary guidelines (e.g., “at least” or “no more than”). Olive oil as a categorical variable rather than a continuous variable would not account for over- or underconsumption, as with the other food components. The authors of the Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP) score justified this scoring pattern because the Mediterranean diet pyramid does not include a recommended amount of olive oil.",6807c0c4-5784-4052-91f8-bfa6ac5431fa
49,discussion15," As such, interpretation of the magnitude of impact of the substitution of partial olive oil for no olive oil should be considered carefully. In comparison, the simplicity of this substitution makes it favorable in terms of practicing it from a behavioral standpoint. Additional limitations of the current study include the potential recall or self-reporting biases that may arise when conducting a 24-hour recall. Additionally, the use of a 2-day diet recall may not accurately reflect dietary intakes over time. This presents a unique challenge when assessing individual dietary components that may not be consumed or used on a daily basis, such as olive oil. However, NHANES is the most representative sample of the US population; therefore, it provides a unique opportunity to assess Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP)s in Americans.",9850094a-b4db-4878-95fd-322c9929e7e4
50,discussion16," Subsequently, the substitutions suggested in this study do not take into account an economic perspective, as the swaps may be more expensive than the original item or the foods may not be available in food deserts.  In conclusion, the findings of this study offer empirical evidence that most Americans are not meeting the recommendations for an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP). However, a few simple, isocaloric food substitutions with or without honey can help most all American adults increase alignment with to an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP), without sacrificing satiety. Clinicians and nutrition practitioners may find the simplicity of the message useful in promoting adherence to an Mediterranean style diet pattern (MSDP).
