1,methods0," The subjects from the Chinese Wuxi Exposure and Breast Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study, included 818 patients and 935 healthy controls. A validated food frequency questionnaire used for diet assessment and a modified version of the alternate Mediterranean Diet Score, which is called the alternate Chinese Diet Score, was developed to assess adherence to a migrated Chinese version of the Mediterranean diet, which we called the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern. Soy foods, rapeseed oil, and coarse cereals replaced legumes, olive oil, and whole grains reflecting the cuisine of the region. We examined the association between the vegetable-fruit-soy diet adherence and breast cancer risk, stratified by menopause status (pre- or postmenopausal) and receptor status [estrogen-receptor (ER), progesterone-receptor (PR) status, and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)] oncogene expression, followed by five specific combinations (ER+, ER–, ER+/PR+,ER–/PR–, and ER–/PR–/HER2–).",75cde448-fc51-436d-b567-322026b5ff5c
2,methods1,"   Study Subjects  The Chinese Wuxi Exposure and Breast Cancer Study (2013–2014) was a case-control study of the role of biology, diet, lifestyle, and environmental factors in the etiology of breast cancer in Asian women. Subjects were all adult women and were restricted to local residents who have lived in Wuxi for at least 5 years. All newly diagnosed (the diagnosis date was within 1 year before enrolment) women with breast cancer (ICD code: C50) among local residents identified by cancer registries were eligible to be included as cases. Secondary and recurrent cancers were excluded. Controls were derived from the local area as cases and were 1:1 individually matched with cases by age (±2 years) and residence. As personal information such as name, address, date of birth, and sex for all residents was available in the local demographic information database; eligible controls were randomly identified from this database.",0bbc49b8-fde7-430c-a0df-8ce4b3bb33d1
3,methods2," For each control chosen, two additional subjects were selected as a backup at the same time. When the first control could not be interviewed, an alternative was enrolled in the study. The selection procedure repeated until an eligible subject was interviewed. A total of 1,042 eligible breast cancer cases and 1,042 health controls were identified during the study period. Case and controls with major dietary habits changed over the past 10 years, which were excluded from this study. In analysis, 818 cases and 935 controls were included, with a frequency match (cases and controls have the same distributions over age and residence). All subjects gave voluntary written informed consent to participate in this research.

4,methods3,"  Data on Diet  The usual diet was assessed by a validated, semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)), which included 149 items along with the recipes commonly used in China; a detailed description is given in Zhao et al. (17). Nutrient and energy intake were calculated through the Chinese Food Composition Database (2018, 6th version).  Dietary intake assessment included whether the food was consumed, consumption frequency (times of per day/week/month/year), and the average amount of food consumption at each time. The 149 food items in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were classified into 18 predefined food groups based on similarities in nutrient profile and culinary usage.",00af6c4a-4046-40c3-b4b8-6c81b551605d
5,methods4,"  Alternate Chinese Diet Score  A modified version on the alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMED) which we called the alternate Chinese Diet Score (aCHD) was developed to assess adherence to a migrated Chinese version of the Mediterranean diet, which we called the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern. Soy foods, rapeseed oil, and coarse cereals replaced legumes, olive oil, and whole grains, reflecting the cuisine of the region. The aMED (18, 19) is an adapted version of the traditional Mediterranean Diet Score created by Trichopoulou et al. (20, 21). The aMED established by Fung et al. (18) included nine dietary components that are typical of the Mediterranean diet. For each of the presumed beneficial food items [vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, whole grains, fish, and the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acid intake (MUFA:SFA)], one point was given when the intake was at least the sex-specific median intake, and zero otherwise.",71b25697-e14c-40a9-9dd6-809635255264
6,methods5," For red and processed meat, 1 point was given (and 0 otherwise) when the intake was below the sex-specific median intake. In the full aMED, 1 additional point is normally given when alcohol intake is between 5 and 25 g/day, and 0 otherwise (19), with a 9-point sum score (minimal to maximal conformity). The aCHD also ranged from zero to nine points in the present analysis (Appendix).  To test the role of the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern in the etiology of breast cancer, we design an interaction test between the aCHD and the duration of diet habits. The “duration” indicator was based on interviewing subjects about how long they have maintained their current diet habits, and the medians were calculated based on the distribution of the premenopausal controls and postmenopausal controls, respectively.",5d52fa56-49c3-4ef0-9e48-dbcfe74d2b6b

Associations between the aCHD score (divided into four quartiles, as a nominal predictor) and breast cancer were estimated in terms of adjusted ORs and respective 95%CIs by logistic regression models.

21,discussion0," We found that the vegetable-fruit-soy diet adherence was inversely associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, especially with ER- and ER-/PR-subtypes. This favorable influence of the vegetable-fruit-soy diet adherence on postmenopausal breast cancer risk cannot be explained by the single effect of soy foods since only a very slight attenuation in estimates was noted after excluding the effect of soy foods. Our finding supports the hypothesis that food components and their combinations in the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern play an etiologic role in breast cancer.  The abundant vegetables and moderate fruits intake are the common features of the Mediterranean and Chinese traditional diets (11). Both diets recommend taking more high-quality white meat rather than red meat (12, 13). However, there are also obvious differences between the two; the main differences are the preference of the two diets in the choice of legumes and oils.",95e69424-5c10-4306-ad8f-747bee93a9d1
22,discussion1," Legumes in the traditional Mediterranean diet which includes lentils, peas, beans, chickpeas, and the like; chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) and fava beans are two of the most common beans in Mediterranean cooking, but other varieties, such as black beans and kidney beans, can also be seen. On the other side, beans are a typical component in the traditional Chinese diet, which included soybeans, broad beans, peas, mung beans, black beans, and many other varieties, and soybeans and related products are the most common. Another major difference is the choice of oils; the Mediterranean region mainly consumes olive oil while the Chinese use other unsaturated fat cooking oils other than olive oil, such as rapeseed, soybean, flaxseed, peanut, corn, and sunflower oils, and rapeseed oils and soybean oils are the most common.",cb55ce62-7216-4214-8b9e-5ec67fd55d22
23,discussion2," Therefore, the migrated vegetable-fruit-soy diet is not a traditional Mediterranean diet because soybeans and rapeseed oils were not traditional Mediterranean foods. However, both of them could be associated with healthy fat characteristics of the traditional Mediterranean diet, and beans provide fiber, protein, carbohydrate, B vitamins, iron, copper, magnesium, manganese, zinc, and phosphorous. They are naturally low in fat and are practically free of saturated fat, and because they are plant foods, they are cholesterol-free as well. Olives oils provide potential breast cancer benefits, which may because they have a high monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio, while rapeseed oils also have a high polyunsaturated/saturated fat ratio with a similar protective effect to that of monounsaturated oil in reducing breast cancer risk.",2b79a7fe-c7af-4a40-ba9f-7cf52260e802
24,discussion3," In terms of grain intake, the Mediterranean inhabitants included whole grains as the main carbohydrate source years ago, as was also used in China before the 1990s (25). The distinction is that the former diet included non-refined barley and wheat, the latter mainly consumes coarse cereals. Although differences in dietary composition between the two regions exist, the main aim of the study is to conclude the main commonalities that are major protective factors of breast cancer.  Many have studied the relationship between individual dietary factors and breast cancer. Alcohol consumption appears to be a convincing risk factor (26, 27), whereas fresh fruit and vegetables appear to be protective (28, 29). However, there is still little evidence for the role of most individual foods or nutrients on breast cancer risk.",1bc44218-36c5-4215-868b-4419be4fc30b
25,discussion4," In this study, alcohol intake was also positively associated with breast cancer, while soy foods consumption seems to be the only food ingredient that was negatively correlated with breast cancer. Soy foods are an important potential beneficial factor in traditional Chinese diet practice and our findings are consistent with previous studies (23, 24). The biological mechanisms for soy isoflavones to reduce the risk of breast cancer may be related to preferential binding to ER-b relative to ER-a (30). Soy isoflavones may also act via estrogen-independent mechanisms, such as inhibiting the nuclear transcription factor jB DNA binding activity and the Akt signaling pathway (31), both of which are vital to maintaining a steady-state balance between survival and apoptosis of the cell.",1e97bc86-42c1-4ff3-a8e4-7abc9bd98637
26,discussion5," Although soy foods seem to be the only food ingredient that may reduce the risk of breast cancer in the present analysis; the favorable influence of the dietary pattern cannot only be explained by the independent effect of separate food ingredients. This is because, when we control the favorable influence of soy foods, the beneficial effects of the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern were still significant.  The possible beneficial effects of the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern on breast cancer can borrow from the physiological mechanisms of the traditional Mediterranean diet. The Mediterranean diet is characterized by a diversity of various polyphenols, especially from nuts, fruits, and legumes, and suggests a potential approach in population to increase polyphenols intake (32).",0e8220d8-a0cf-41cb-a432-0c67776ae5f6
27,discussion6," Epidemiological evidence indicates that long-term consumption of a diet rich in plant polyphenols could have a negative impact on the initiation and proliferation of breast cancer, especially with the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that can neutralize free radicals and prevent DNA damage (5, 33–36). Phytoestrogens may have a tumor-inhibiting role as they act like estrogen. The favorable fatty acid profile of the Mediterranean diet may influence breast cancer risk by reducing hyperinsulinemia in cells (3, 16). As fiber intake increases, circulating estrogen and androstenedione levels may decrease, which affects the carcinogenesis of breast cancer (37, 38).",e77b8df4-1729-4830-8510-30a58a480868
28,discussion7," The heterogeneity of menopausal status on breast cancer may be due to the greater influence of genetic factors and early-life events of premenopausal breast cancer, which result in the possible protective effect of the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern being more difficult to observe in premenopausal breast cancer (5, 16).  Several prospective studies examined relations between the Mediterranean diet and breast cancer risk, with most (2–6, 8) studies demonstrating an inverse correlation and especially among hormone receptor-negative, but not all (39, 40). The etiology of different breast tumor molecular subtypes may be different, but the evidence remains unclear, especially in different racial populations (40–42). Our finding suggests that the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern is inversely associated with postmenopausal breast cancer and that the inverse association was greater and easier to detect among ER- tumors.",439de352-c482-43e2-8d5f-06fe05f353e9
29,discussion8," As has been suggested before (2, 5), any potential influence of dietary factors may be difficult to detect in ER+ tumors given the strong influence of hormonal factors. In ER- tumors, other risk factors, including diet, may exert a relatively larger influence and may be more easily detectable (2, 16). Findings between different breast tumor molecular subtypes and the vegetable-fruit-soy diet adherence may be particularly important because ER- tumors have a poor prognosis and lower survival rates than ER+ tumors (8, 16, 43).  Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, the data were collected from a case-control study, which might be partially influenced by the selection and recall biases inherent in the design. However, we only included newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer to reduce the recall bias. In addition, the dietary preference was collected based on composite measures, which were less likely to cause selective bias on specific foods/food groups.",e11ed388-7c3c-4b27-8d1f-d2ae1a939317
30,discussion9," Second, the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern is not a traditional Mediterranean diet, but the components of the alternative foods of the vegetable-fruit-soy diet that were related to the health characteristics of the traditional Mediterranean diet. The results demonstrated that the foods components and their combinations in the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern may supply benefits in breast cancer prevention and are more suitable for the Chinese population. Finally, the sample size of molecular subtypes of breast tumor are small; we collected the ER information of 439 of 818 cases, including 301 ER-positive and 138 ER-negative. Although there is a suggestion that the Mediterranean diet is inversely associated with ER-/PR-/HER2- (“triple-negative” tumors) (16), our results may lack enough statistical power to find it.",4f64fdfd-cf3b-4345-9eb0-689b12bee53e
31,discussion10,"  The strengths of our study were the use of a validated food-frequency questionnaire and a modified questionnaire surrounding the Mediterranean dietary pattern and individual dietary factors to examine their association with breast cancer risk in the Chinese female population. Since the diet is a modifiable risk factor, identifying the characterization of the population most susceptible to harmful and beneficial dietary habits is critical for breast cancer prevention policy design. Our findings support vegetable-fruit-soy diet compliance associated with reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk, especially with ER- or ER-/PR- subtypes.  Conclusion  The favorable influence from the Mediterranean diet pattern may also apply to Chinese women, and the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern reduced the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, particularly among ER- subtype, and ER–/PR–subtype.",de428552-b1f4-4067-a1f0-42c7db2343a7
