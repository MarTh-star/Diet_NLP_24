0,methods0," 4.1. Pomegranate Extract (PomE)  PomE (EFSA-approved) was provided by Natac Group company. Bioactive compounds were extracted from the fruit part of Punica granatum L.  During the extraction, various solvent ratios of ethanol to water were used (pure water, 50:50, 60:40, and 80:20), with the ratio of ethanol:water 70:30 being the one that released the highest concentration of punicalagins (40%) on one side; and a higher selectivity for punicalagins in contrast to other phytocompound on the other.  4.2. Animal Model  To evaluate the potential of PomE in the control of the metabolic stress associated with obesity, a preclinical study of high-fat-diet (high fat diet (HFD))-induced obesity was designed. A total of 28 six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into three different groups, namely group 1: ND-control (N = 6); group 2: high fat diet (HFD) group (N = 10); and group 3: high fat diet (HFD)-PomE group (N = 12).",584ec865-0bae-483a-afcb-aa0ab90cd6a1
1,methods1," High-fat diet (high fat diet (HFD)) was obtained from Brogaarden (reference D12451i). The normal diet contained 10% fat, while the high-fat diet contained 45% of total fat. For the first 6 weeks, mice from groups 2 and 3 were fed with the high fat diet (HFD) to cause a metabolic disturbance associated with the increased weight. Afterward, at the age of 12 weeks, administration of PomE or the vehicle was initiated. PomE was dissolved in drinking water and administered by gastric gavage 3 days per week during the 12–14 weeks. Drinking water was also administered by gavage as a vehicle to control groups on the same days. Previously, a pilot study was performed to determine the maximal dose of the extract without toxicity. Thus, PomE was administered at a dose of 0.1 g of extract per Kg of mice.  Insulin and glucose tolerance tests, haemograms, and plasma analysis were performed at the beginning, middle, and at the end of the study.",56ddc9b7-ebe2-42d6-90ae-2130ba8c5c0f
2,methods2," Densitometry and indirect calorimetry were performed at the end of the trial, and exposition to the cold chamber for heat stress was performed in the days prior to slaughter.  All procedures were approved by the Research and Animal Welfare Ethics Committee of Center (CNIO)-ISCIII Ethics Committee for Research and Animal Welfare (CEIyBA number CBAO6_2018) under the provisions of RD53/2013 law.  Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane 4–5%, followed by a cardiac puncture, to collect the maximum volume of blood.  4.3. Glucose Tolerance Test (glucose tolerance test (GTT)), Insulin Tolerance Test (insulin tolerance test (ITT)), the Index of Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA/IR)  4.3.1. Glucose Tolerance Test (glucose tolerance test (GTT))  Previously to the glucose tolerance test (GTT), mice fasted for 16 h. On the day of the test, glucose (0.5 g/mL) was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 2 g/kg.",8b19c4b7-4466-461b-9ec4-e1375876ceec
3,methods3," After injection, blood glucose levels were quantified at the indicated times (0, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min). For this purpose, a superficial cut at the end of the tail was performed with a scalpel, and glucose strips were read by a glucometer (obtained from Menarini Diagnostics, Wokingham, United Kingdom).  Before the injection of glucose, at time 0, about 15–20 μL of blood was extracted and immediately stored at 4 °C for the subsequent analysis of insulin and glucose levels [52].  4.3.2. Insulin Tolerance Test (insulin tolerance test (ITT))  The human insulin was diluted in saline buffer at a concentration of 0.125 U/mL, and the amount of insulin to be injected was adjusted to 0.75 U/kg. After the insulin injection, blood glucose was quantified at different times (0, 15, 30, 60, 60, 120, and 180 min) using the same glucose strips as described before [52].  4.3.3.",26477b61-03ed-40f6-8877-4e899bf2cf00
4,methods4," The Index of Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA/IR)  Fasting blood was collected using capillary tubes in the tail´s cut at time 0 min, prior to the glucose injection. Plasmas were obtained after 10 min of centrifugation at 12,000 rcf in a centrifuge at 4 °C. Fasting insulin was determined using the Elisa kit obtained from Crystal Chem (Inc-90080; Downers Grove, IL, USA). Fasting basal insulin and glucose values were used to calculate HOMA/IR, applying the validated equation HOMA/IR = (Fasting Glucose × Fasting Insulin)/22.5 as described [53,54].  4.4.",d2a92478-fcd4-4105-801c-fe54be0b07d0
5,methods5," Indirect Calorimetry  Biological parameters of mice—the total volume of oxygen (VO2) exchanged, the volume of carbon dioxide (VCO2) expelled, the energy expenditure (EE), the activity of the mice (movement) and the intake of food and drinking water—from high fat diet (HFD) control group and high fat diet (HFD)-PomE group were monitored individually, using the metabolic cages of the Oxylet Panlab Harvard Apparatus at the Spanish National Cancer Research Center (Center (CNIO)).  Previously, the fluxes of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the metabolic cages were stabilized using the weight of solid tissues determined by dual X-ray absorption densitometry with the GE Medical Systems PIXImus Lunar Densitometer. Images were registered for 5 min for each mouse, taking measurements of the mass of solid and fat tissues. Before the exposition, all animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane by inhalation.",f4567e88-4df0-40b7-b88d-06d5d70220b4
6,methods6,"  After the acclimatization and stabilization of fluxes for 72 h, the study variables were monitored for another 72 h, in cycles of 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness. The analysis was performed separately for repeated measurements in the third day, during the day or the night, given the different physiological behaviour expected in these two periods.  4.5. Cold Chambers  A cold chamber with insulated cages was used for individualized mice. During the stay in the chamber, the temperature of each mouse was measured using a rectal probe for three times (on days zero and three and the day of the sacrifice). Mice were individually introduced into the chamber cages at 18 °C for acclimatation for 3 days, thus reducing the heat shock of the mice. After these 3 days, the temperature was gradually reduced to 4 °C. The chamber was maintained at 4 °C for another 24 h. After this time, all mice were sacrificed, and their tissues were collected for the subsequent molecular analysis.",c8e7ba27-da02-4db1-85d7-2e3a972a45be
7,methods7,"  The gavage with vehicle or treatment was performed just before introducing the animals into the chamber, and after the opening of the chamber to measure their temperature before setting it at 4 °C.  4.6. Gene Expression Analysis  For the RNA extraction from tissues, the corresponding tissue fragments, frozen at −80 °C, were cut on dry ice using cold forceps and a tempered scalpel (keeping low RNA degradation by the action of RNA-ases). Then, the tissues were homogenized in 1–1.5 mL of phenol over dry ice (TriReagent obtained from Sigma; Burlington, MA, USA), using a T10 IKA homogenizer. Once the tissues were disaggregated, 0.2 volumes of chloroform were added, and the mixes were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rcf at 4 °C. After that, the clear supernatants, corresponding to RNA, were collected and transferred to RNA-ase-free tubes. A total of 0.5 volumes of isopropanol were added and then centrifuged for 10 min (12,000 rcf at 4 °C).",cfb12693-4f0e-48f2-91be-5aa8ef275337
8,methods8," Total RNAs were quantified with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000/2000c, obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA).  A total of 1 μg of total RNA of each sample was converted into cDNA with the commercial high-capacity RNA-to-cDNA Master Mix kit from Life Technologies-ThermoFisher; Waltham, MA, USA). The melting curve, on Applied Biosciences 2720 Thermal Cycler equipment, consisted of 10 min at 25 °C, 120 min at 37 °C, 5 min at 85 °C, and finally at 4 °C until storage at −20 °C.  qRT PCRs were performed on the 7900HT Real-Time PCR apparatus using Taqman Gene Expression Master Mix and Taqman-specific probes (Supplementary Table S1). Tissue samples were analysed in triplicates. The analysis of gene expression was performed using the Expression Suite Software version 1.0.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and the calculation of the relative expression of each gene was performed following the 2−ΔΔCt method [55].",978dfc5b-a33d-4919-8798-beb3774d3f42
9,methods9," Beta-2-Microglobulin (B2M) or 18S RNA were used as housekeeping genes.  4.7. Statistical Analysis  One-way analysis of variance (Analysis One way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) followed by Bonferroni as a post-test was used to determine statistical differences for the analysis of glucose, insulin, and gene expression between groups. All statistically significant values are indicated with asterisks based on their p-value. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. All graphical representations show the results as the mean ± standard deviation of the averages of the experiments. The statistical program R version 3.6.1 (Warwick, UK) was used for the comparative analysis of the indirect calorimetry assay. Thus, both the average values and the area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)), obtained by the trapezoidal integration, on the third day were modelled.",be0d8c5d-4eaf-4e36-9a82-3c9b451bc379
10,methods10," Linear mixed models were used to appropriately consider the intra-mouse correlation using, on the predictor variable side as a random factor, a categorical variable; and as fixed factors, the weight of solid tissues (previously obtained by densitometry), time 0 h as the baseline, as well as an interaction between a three-level factor corresponding to the day, and a two-level factor corresponding to the treatment (extract versus control). In addition, marginal tests were performed for the significance of the treatment. Excel Professional Plus 2016 software and GraphPad Prism 8.0.1 (La Jolla, CA, USA) were used for the graphical representations. ",879962a2-2ff4-47d2-9472-e0f988ee8875
