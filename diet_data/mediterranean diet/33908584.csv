0,methods0," This was a cross-sectional study of 1862 men and women aged 46–73 years, randomly selected from a large primary care centre in Ireland. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), MD, DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) and E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) scores were derived from validated food frequency questionnaires. Correlation and multivariate-adjusted linear regression analyses with correction for multiple testing were performed to examine dietary score relationships with biomarker concentrations.   Study population and setting  The Cork and Kerry Diabetes and Heart Disease Study (Phase II—Mitchelstown Cohort) was a single-centre study conducted between 2010 and 2011. A random sample was recruited from a large primary care centre in Mitchelstown, County Cork, Ireland. The Living Health Clinic serves a population of approximately 20,000 predominantly White European subjects, with a mix of urban and rural residents.",8b775f9c-bb10-4e01-9b79-fed9544c0da6
1,methods1," Stratified sampling was employed to recruit equal numbers of men and women from all registered attending patients in the 45–70-year age group. In total, 3807 potential participants were selected from the practice list. Following the exclusion of duplicates, deaths and subjects incapable of consenting or attending appointment, 3051 were invited to participate in the study and of these, about two-thirds (2047, 49% male) completed the questionnaire and physical examination components of the baseline assessment. Dietary data were available for 1862 subjects. Details regarding the study design, sampling procedures and methods of data collection have been reported previously [27]. Ethics committee approval conforming to the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of University College Cork. A letter signed by the contact GP in the clinic was sent out to all selected participants with a reply slip indicating acceptance or refusal.",87ff0a58-55a6-469d-9635-d1adf190be93
2,methods2," All participants gave signed informed consent, including permission to use their data for research purposes.  Clinical procedures  Study participants attended the clinic in the morning after an overnight fast and blood samples were taken on arrival. Fasting glucose and glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) concentrations were measured in fresh samples by Cork University Hospital Biochemistry Laboratory using standardised procedures. Glucose concentrations were determined using a glucose hexokinase assay (Olympus Life and Material Science Europa Ltd., Lismeehan, Co. Clare, Ireland) and HbA1c levels were measured in the haematology laboratory on an automated high-pressure liquid chromatography instrument Tosoh G7 [Tosoh HLC-723 (G7), Tosoh Europe N.V, Tessenderlo, Belgium].",b02756b6-569a-4525-b26b-56686c275c1c
3,methods3," C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), adiponectin, leptin, resistin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were assessed using a biochip array system (Evidence Investigator; Randox Laboratories, UK). Complement component 3 (C3) was measured by immunoturbidimetric assay (RX Daytona; Randox Laboratories). White blood cell count (White blood cell count (WBC)), neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil and basophil concentrations were determined by flow cytometry technology as part of a full blood count. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR)) was calculated as neutrophils divided by lymphocytes.  Anthropometric measurements were performed by trained researchers with reference to a standard operating procedures manual.",868f95bf-c7a2-4da3-989c-678c819e0e18
4,methods4," Height was measured with a portable Seca Leicester height/length stadiometer (Seca, Birmingham, UK) and weight was measured using a portable electronic Tanita WB-100MA weighing scale (Tanita Corp, IL, USA). The weighing scale was placed on a firm flat surface and was calibrated weekly. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.  Data collection  A general health and lifestyle questionnaire assessed demographic variables, lifestyle behaviours and morbidity. Information on sex, age, education, prescription anti-inflammatory medication use, smoking status, diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and cancer was provided by participants.",a1ba3264-8906-4992-91e6-ae8ba210e64e
5,methods5," The presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was obtained by asking study participants if they had been diagnosed with any one of the following seven conditions: Heart Attack (including coronary thrombosis or myocardial infarction), Heart Failure, Angina, Aortic Aneurysm, Hardening of the Arteries, Stroke or any other Heart Trouble. Subjects who indicated a diagnosis of any one of these conditions were classified as having cardiovascular disease (CVD). Physical activity levels were measured using the validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) [28].  Dietary assessment  A Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) was used for dietary assessment.",32ee46f5-90c3-4505-ac24-871a5741e12a
6,methods6," Diet was evaluated using a modified version of the self-completed European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) [29], which has been validated extensively in several populations [30]. Adapted to reflect the Irish diet, the 150-item semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) used in the current study was originally validated for use in the Irish population using food diaries and a protein biomarker in a volunteer sample [31] and incorporated into the SLÁN Irish National Surveys of Lifestyle Attitudes and Nutrition 1998, 2002 and 2007 [32–34]. The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) was also validated using a 7-day weighed food record completed in another Irish study (Lifeways Cross-generational Study), with reasonable agreement for fat, carbohydrate, and their components, and with lower agreement for protein [35].",ac5e0330-c1f1-4f35-9d5c-85943310b97a
7,methods7," The average medium serving of each food item consumed by participants over the last 12 months was converted into quantities using standard portion sizes. Food item quantity was expressed as (g/d) and beverages as (ml/d). The daily intake of energy and nutrients was computed from Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) data using a tailored computer programme (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) Software Version 1.0; developed by the National Nutrition Surveillance Centre, School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland), which linked frequency selections with the food equivalents in McCance and Widdowson Food Tables [36].  Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score  Based on the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was constructed.",9ca518d7-7dcd-4ad6-807e-6f1dce739fcc
8,methods8," Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy foods and is limited in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, red meat and added fats. This diet has been promoted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (part of the National Institutes of Health, a United States government organisation) to prevent and control hypertension. For each food group, consumption was divided into quintiles, and participants were classified according to their intake ranking. Consumption of healthy food components were rated on a scale of 1–5; the higher the score, the more frequent the consumption of that food (i.e., those in quintile 1 had the lowest consumption and received a score of 1; conversely, those in quintile 5 had the highest consumption and received a score of 5). Less-healthy dietary constituents, where low consumption is desired, were scored on a reverse scale, with lower consumption receiving higher scores.",dfd64e0c-6de7-4367-a75d-885f0aa8d7e2
9,methods9," Component scores were summed, and an overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was calculated for each person. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet scores ranged from 11 to 42. Lower scores represent poorer and higher scores represent better quality diet [37].  MD score  A scale indicating the degree of adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet was developed by Trichopoulou et al. [38] and revised to include fish intake [19]. This score is proposed for implementation and uptake in non-Mediterranean countries such as Ireland for incorporation into current Irish dietary guidelines [20, 39]. Scoring is based on intake of 9 items: vegetables, legumes, fruit and nuts, dairy products, cereals, meat and meat products, fish, alcohol and the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat. A value of 0 or 1 was assigned to each of nine items with use of the sex-specific median as the cut-off.",ac22660d-acd5-478a-a27f-0d4719c41d90
10,methods10," For beneficial components (vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereal and fish), consumption above the study median received 1 point; all other intakes received 0 points. For components presumed to be detrimental (dairy products, meat and meat products), consumption below the median received 1 point. For fat intake, we used the ratio of monounsaturated lipids to saturated lipids. For ethanol, men who consumed 10–50 g/day and women who consumed 5–25 g/day received 1 point; otherwise, the score was 0. Thus, the total MD score ranged from 0 (minimal adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet) to 9 (maximal adherence).  DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) and E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) scores  DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) scores were calculated using a method previously reported by Shivappa et al. [22].",88ab2374-c649-426e-a91b-01dac5c5d463
11,methods11," Briefly, the scoring algorithm based on an extensive review of the literature focused on the effect of diet on six inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and C reactive protein (CRP)) from 1950 to 2010. A total of 26 of the 45 possible food parameters were used for DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) calculation based on the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) in this study and these were as follows: carbohydrate, protein, fat, alcohol, fibre, cholesterol, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, niacin, thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, iron, magnesium, zinc, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, folic acid, onion, garlic and tea.",6ee0e91d-c8fa-4a30-bc7b-4601668b2311
12,methods12," Dietary information for each study participant was linked to a regionally representative database that provides a global estimate of mean intake for each of the foods, nutrients and other food components along with its standard deviation considered in the DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) definition [40]. These parameters were then used to derive the participant’s exposure relative to the standard global mean as a z-score, derived by subtracting the mean of the regionally representative database from the amount reported and dividing this value by the parameter’s standard deviation. These z-scores were then converted to proportions (i.e., with values ranging from 0 to 1) and then centred by doubling and subtracting 1. The resulting value was then multiplied by the corresponding food parameter effect score (derived from a literature review on the basis of 1943 peer-reviewed articles) [40].",13499fb6-9268-4a95-804f-aedcedb6f9ae
13,methods13," All of the food parameter-specific DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) scores were then summed to create the overall DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) score for every participant in the study. The E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) scores were calculated by converting raw dietary components to amount per 1000 kcal, and then repeating a process analogous to that used for the DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) but employing an energy-adjusted global comparison database [41]. For both the DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) and E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII), higher scores are more pro-inflammatory and lower scores are anti-inflammatory.  Classification and scoring of variables  Categories of education included ‘some primary (not complete)’, ‘primary or equivalent’, ‘intermediate/group certificate or equivalent’, ‘leaving certificate or equivalent’, ‘diploma/certificate’, ‘primary university degree’ and ‘postgraduate/higher degree’.",bb51f69f-371d-4b85-a108-2a0b22077cb4
14,methods14," These were collapsed and recoded into a dichotomous variable: ‘primary education only’ (finished full-time education at 13 years or younger) and ‘intermediate or higher’. Type 2 diabetes was determined as a fasting glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/l or a HbA1c level ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol) [42] or by self-reported diagnosis.  Smoking status was defined as follows: (i) never smoked, i.e., having never smoked at least 100 cigarettes (5 packs) in their entire life; (ii) former smoker, i.e., having smoked 100 cigarettes in their entire life and do not smoke at present; and (iii) current smoker, i.e., smoking at present. These definitions were the same as those used in the SLÁN National Health and Lifestyle Survey [43]. Physical activity was categorised as low, moderate and high levels of activity using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). This was then recoded as a dichotomous variable: ‘moderate/high’ or ‘low’ physical activity. ",b09c8803-5b6c-4061-b4da-55d2d67a0310
15,analysis0," Descriptive characteristics were examined according to sex and dietary score quartiles. Categorical features are presented as percentages and continuous variables are shown as a mean (plus or minus one standard deviation) or a median and interquartile range for skewed data. Differences were analysed using a Pearson’s chi-square test, Student’s t-test or a Mann Whitney U. Trend relationships were determined using a Jonckheere test, a linear-by-linear chi-square or an ANOVA. Correlations between dietary scores and dietary markers were examined using Spearman’s rank-order correlation. Partial non-parametric tests examined correlations between dietary indices and inflammatory and thrombotic biomarkers. Dietary scores were standardised and skewed biomarker data were log-transformed.",10366fa0-dbd2-425c-b284-abc52906e76d
16,analysis1," Linear regression analysis was performed to determine Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), MD, DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) and E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) score associations with biomarker concentrations. Two models were run: the first model was adjusted for sex and age; a second model was adjusted for sex, age, education, use of anti-inflammatory medications, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, smoking status, physical activity, Body mass index (BMI) and total energy intake. Models which examined the E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) were not adjusted for total energy intake as this was accounted for in the formulation of the E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) score. To correct for the multiple testing performed, we calculated false discovery rate (false discovery rate (FDR)) adjusted p values via the Romano-Wolf multiple hypothesis correction method using the rwolf command in Stata [44].",64f01c97-23f2-4e1f-93fe-1e4261a21ad2
17,analysis2," Data analysis was conducted using Stata SE Version 13 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) for Windows.

19,results4," characteristics of the study population were examined according to dietary score quartiles. In general, subjects who had poorer dietary quality or the most pro-inflammatory diets were more likely to be male, have lower educational levels and type 2 diabetes, were more likely to be current smokers, reported lower physical activity levels and had higher (lower for adiponectin) concentrations of inflammatory and thrombotic biomarkers than did those who consumed higher quality/less pro-inflammatory diets.  Correlation analysis  In correlation analyses which examined relationships between dietary scores and dietary markers (Table 2), better diet quality or a less inflammatory diet was correlated with reduced consumption of saturated fatty acids and red meat (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), MD, E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII)) and greater consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (MD and DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII)).",a2ba0b00-effd-4771-a7dd-a70529f7d3cc

Consistent with previous research, these results suggest reduced systemic inflammation as a potential biological mechanism linking a higher quality healthy diet with beneficial health effects [15, 17]. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score demonstrated the greatest number of significant relationships with markers of low-grade inflammation and raised immune activation in models which accounted for multiple testing.",84bb3129-0446-488f-bfc6-17c80c96c5a5
30,discussion1," Collectively, these findings provide evidence that better diet quality, determined by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, may be more closely associated with inflammatory biomarkers related to health in middle- to older-aged adults than the MD, DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) and E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) scores.  Chronic low-grade inflammation is a major contributor to chronic conditions including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [24]. Low-grade systemic inflammation may also promote development of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) by increasing levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen (“free radicals”), which can damage DNA and affect endothelial function. In addition, inflammatory cytokines are thought to activate transcription factors that promote cancer progression through changes in signalling pathways that promote cell proliferation and resistance to cell death [46].",4e2ed7cd-e4d2-404b-a392-7f8aa13f11db
31,discussion2," The origins of low-grade inflammation are multifactorial. Although the production of inflammatory mediators is an essential mechanism by which leukocytes confer immune protection in response to tissue injury, excessive weight gain leads to adipose tissue remodelling with the release of adipose-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines and free fatty acids into circulation, leading to metabolic dysfunction [47] and increased risk of chronic disease [15, 48].  Evidence suggests that some foods, food components and nutrients modulate inflammatory status [24]. Nutrients such as vitamins C and E, selenium and carotenoids are antioxidants that act to reduce development of reactive species that can initiate chronic disease development through inflammation. Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes and nuts that contain these and other nutrients may provide anti-inflammatory benefits.",845665f4-484d-4cac-bc76-9c2205f93df0
32,discussion3," Studies suggest that excessive amounts of red and processed meats, refined grains and sugar-sweetened beverages act through a variety of mechanisms to increase inflammation [49, 50].  Importantly, the impact of diet in modulating inflammation is thought to be due to complex interactions between foods and nutrients having bioactive properties [15]. Accordingly, studies have highlighted the need to characterise the relationship between diet and systemic inflammation through assessment of dietary patterns, as dietary indices consider the fact that foods are eaten in combination, thus removing the limitation that single nutrients may not reflect the overall quality of diet as a whole and are restricted in their ability to take into account interactions among nutrients [51]. Reinforcing this concept are results from the Nurses’ Health Study; Fung et.",a111e869-759e-497e-af14-06c1af0a7557
33,discussion4," al found beneficial effects of adhering to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in reducing inflammation in 24-year follow-up [18]. These findings are supported in a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials which suggest that the beneficial effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on reducing chronic disease risk are due not only to reductions in blood pressure, but also to improvements in inflammatory biomarker levels [52, 53]. In a study which examined the effects of the MD in men with metabolic syndrome, Richard et. al found that even in the absence of weight loss, consuming the MD significantly reduced inflammation [54]. Both the DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) and E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) scores have been validated against inflammatory biomarkers in previous research [15, 24, 51].",04a7f89c-9b49-4e19-b6c8-e809e4277abf
34,discussion5," In addition, a recent literature review which examined 60 cross-sectional studies found an association between higher quality diet (mostly MD and anti-inflammatory diet scores) and more favourable inflammatory biomarker levels [26].  Nevertheless, it should be noted that the study by Hart et. al [26] observed that less than half the studies included in their review examined more than one inflammatory biomarker, with C reactive protein (CRP) being the most commonly assessed biomarker of systemic inflammation in studies reporting dietary score/inflammation relationships. The review found IL-6 to be the second most examined inflammatory biomarker in dietary studies. However, associations between dietary patterns and IL-6 were found to be less consistent. This inconsistency may be due to the shorter half-life of IL-6 such that C reactive protein (CRP) is likely to remain in the serum longer and because IL-6 triggers production of C reactive protein (CRP) by the liver [55].",c7f0e44c-b46d-4837-95c2-d227633525ce
35,discussion6," This highlights the complex nature of inflammatory pathways when trying to assess overall inflammatory status [26].  In the current study, which compared four dietary indices with a range of biomarkers of chronic low-grade inflammation, we noted correlations between dietary quality and concentrations of C3, C reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, TNF-α, resistin, White blood cell count (WBC), neutrophils, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocytes. In addition, we observed the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score to demonstrate a greater number of significant relationships with inflammatory biomarkers and white blood cells when compared to the DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) and E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) in linear regression models which accounted for multiple testing.",bdfa1537-f916-4099-914a-29469ff092ad
36,discussion7," This finding is interesting and unexpected as the DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) is a relatively new dietary score, based on peer-reviewed research [51], which was developed specifically to provide a summary measure of diet-associated inflammation that could be used in any human population; the E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) is a refinement of the DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) which aimed to address methodological issues concerning total energy and nutrient intake and energy and nutrient densities [41]. However, our results suggest that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score may be superior to both of these indices in describing the association with inflammatory biomarkers. Future modifications and improvements in dietary scores which aim to measure inflammatory status according to dietary intake may be warranted.",77b3205e-4def-46dd-93fa-582df0d5a51d
37,discussion8,"  Also of interest is that we found the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score to be related to a greater number inflammatory/immunity biomarkers compared to the MD score, despite both indices emphasising consumption of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes. Differences in how individual dietary components within each score are weighted may account for this finding. Noticeably, we found poorer dietary quality defined by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score to be more strongly correlated with consumption of red meat, sweet snacks and daily consumption of high fat/sugar foods and drinks based on food pyramid shelf servings. Previous research by our group which examined individual Healthy Eating Index-2015 dietary score components found that fatty acids, saturated fats and added sugars demonstrated significant correlations with a number of inflammatory and thrombotic biomarkers [17].",1feb1aec-49ec-4d5b-98ef-64896c7c3b2b
38,discussion9," However, the MD score used in our research was constructed using a method proposed for use in non-Mediterranean countries such as Ireland [20, 38]. Different iterations of the MD score might have produced different findings. Bearing this in mind, it should be noted that a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials which compared the MD and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indices found that the MD appeared as the dietary pattern that showed the most prominent reduction of inflammatory biomarkers [56]. Nevertheless, studies included in this review which examined the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score were restricted to observing reductions in C reactive protein (CRP) levels only. Future research should examine individual dietary component associations with inflammatory and thrombotic biomarkers that demonstrated relationships with dietary scores in our study.",39f837ef-b159-4fdc-9c3f-0fa9d788e77a
39,discussion10," In addition, future large-scale intervention studies are warranted to allow direct comparison of various dietary patterns in relation to a range of biomarkers reflecting multiple inflammatory and immune-related pathways [56].  Strengths and limitations  This study has several strengths. With the elderly population growing [57] it is to be expected that the number of patients with non-communicable diseases will increase. Modifications in certain lifestyle behaviours and adopting a healthier diet may help prevent against systemic inflammation and this may be of particular importance to older adults.",384b5c22-19c3-4cd9-b9bc-ee8a796f12be
40,discussion11," As far as we are aware, this research is the first to compare Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), MD, DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) and E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) relationships with a wide range of markers of chronic low-grade inflammation and raised immune activation in a middle- to older-aged population; thus, our study has examined the greatest number of biomarkers in a relatively large population in this context. Research on dietary indices is important for public health, as studies on these can provide better insights into disease causation. Other strengths include equal representation by sex (49% male) and the use of validated questionnaires to collect data. Furthermore, to address the issue of multiple testing, we applied a stringent Romano-Wolf multiple hypothesis correction [44], which is more powerful than earlier multiple testing procedures.",bcad8f29-a000-49fb-99df-b72c99a8cfdb
41,discussion12," Nevertheless, given similar correlative strengths that were observed between dietary indices and biomarkers in non-parametric analyses, it should be noted that although correcting for multiple testing reduces the probability of false significant findings, it might also increase the probability of false negative results.  Other limitations should be noted. The cross-sectional study design, which precludes drawing conclusions regarding the temporal direction of relationships, limits inference with respect to causality. This should be considered in light of decades of work on the association between diet and serum lipids which suggest that relationships may be discernible only using longitudinal data [58]. In addition, the use of self-reported questionnaires is subject to potential inaccuracies, recall and reporting bias, including response sets such as social approval, social desirability [59–61] and residual confounding arising from imprecise measurement of variables.",8c84ef29-270a-4c2f-8153-be1db3840aec
42,discussion13," Another potential limitation of this study is the non-availability of information on the remaining 19 food parameters for the DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) and E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) calculations. However, on average, we have had data on 26 food parameters for DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) and E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) score calculations and previous research by our group which looked at the impact of including fewer food items to generate scores found that there was no change in relationships when going from 45 to less than 30 food parameters [24, 62]. The diet of our study population is quite similar/monotonous. Therefore, it is likely that the missing variables (which would not be frequently consumed or in large quantities) would have little to no impact on DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) scores in this population.",db53cb1c-ea5c-4024-8547-92e8399201c7
43,discussion14," Of course, homogeneity of diet will increase the likelihood of not detecting a true relationship between diet and inflammatory markers, especially against the background of measurement imprecision [63]. Consequently, we acknowledge that where the study population and their eating habits/food culture and preferences are more diverse, then there may be a greater impact of missing items if they are ones with more anti/pro-inflammatory effects and/or are consumed in large amounts.  Finally, and related to the previous point, the generalisability of our findings may be limited. Our data were collected from a single primary care-based sample which may not be representative of the general population. However, Ireland represents a generally ethnically homogeneous population [64].",53a181bd-7a7d-420e-b516-2d18b1082627
44,discussion15," In addition, previous research suggests that approximately 98% of Irish adults are registered with a GP and that, even in the absence of a universal patient registration system, it is possible to perform population-based epidemiological studies that are representative using our methods [65].  Conclusions  In conclusion, findings from this research demonstrate that better diet quality, determined by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, may be more closely associated with inflammatory biomarkers related to health in middle- to older-aged adults than the MD, DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) and E-DII) neutrophils (MD) and monocytes (DII) scores. Consequently, although results suggest reduced systemic inflammation as a potential biological mechanism linking a higher quality healthy diet with beneficial health effects, future modifications and improvements in these dietary indices may be warranted.",b0b9bfac-d9d5-4db7-b99a-8aec2a70c8dd
45,discussion16," Increasing understanding of the relationships between diet and markers of health is needed. This should include improved methods of measuring diet, choosing populations to study with greater dietary diversity, further examination of individual dietary components and dietary scores in relation to a wide range of biomarkers reflecting multiple inflammatory and immune-related pathways and examining longitudinal changes in both diet and markers of health. The overall goal is to inform public health planning and policy to improve and maintain optimal health at a population level.
