Estimation of Radical Scavenging Activity by the Diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) Test  The antiradical activity of the HT and SQ combinations, measured by Diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, showed that HT at 2 mol ratio combined with all ratios of SQ (2, 0.5, 0.13 and 0.03 mol ratio) exhibited antioxidant activity (RSA > 40% in the four combinations) (Table 1). This antioxidant capacity was not observed when HT was below 2 mol ratio (data not shown). α-tocopherol was used as an antioxidant standard control.  3.2. Radical Scavenging Activity by the acid) diammonium salt tablets (CAS 30931 67 0 (ABTS) Assay  The acid) diammonium salt tablets (CAS 30931 67 0 (ABTS) antiradical assay showed that HT at 100 μM, combined with all concentrations of SQ (from 0.01 to 100 μM), exhibited a high scavenging activity (RSA > 60% at five combinations) (Table 2).",6b6662e8-9970-4a6a-b38e-ddf36e361eff
14,methods14," HT at 10 μM combined with all the concentrations of SQ showed weak antiradical activity. HT below 10 μM combined with SQ did not present scavenging activity (data not shown).  3.3.

The results are expressed as % of cell survival with respect to the untreated control, which was set as 100%. None of the tested combinations promoted cell death with statistical differences compared to the untreated control (Figure 1).  3.4. Cell Proliferation Assay  The proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells was determined after treatment of HT–SQ from 0.01 to 100 μM for 24 h, and was measured again after another 24 h with fresh medium. After each 24 h, proliferation was measured in a microplate reader. The results are expressed as % of cell survival concerning the untreated control that was set as 100% (Figure 2).",0ed2f503-3e27-4da7-8de0-e738aaf94861
15,methods15," After 48 h, inhibition of the cell survival was observed with HT at 100 μM and all SQ concentrations assayed (Figure 2a).

The results showed that at the lowest SQ concentration (0.01 μM), reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were decreased (~50%). At higher SQ concentrations, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4b).  3.8. Analysis of DNA Damage  DNA damage in MDA-MB-231 was measured by unicellular alkaline electrophoresis after HT (100 μM)-SQ (100, 10 and 1 μM) treatments for 24 h followed by another 24 h in fresh medium. Due to apoptosis results, only three different concentrations of SQ were used to analyze the formation of possible DNA breaks.",6b9ab527-a198-40d7-8b90-60a0fafd6f62

After H2O2 burst, all assayed treatments promoted the prevention of DNA damage (Table 4).  4. Discussion  There is now scientific evidence linking the Mediterranean dietary pattern with the low incidence and prevalence of some chronic diseases such as certain types of cancer. virgin olive oil (VOO) is the main source of fat consumed in this dietary pattern, and its regular intake reduces the incidence of some illnesses, such as cardiovascular diseases and a wide variety of cancers [5]. The minor compounds present in virgin olive oil (VOO) could have a key role in its healthy properties [4,5,6,7,8,9,31,32,33,34]. However, most of these studies are focused mainly on the health benefits of isolated compounds from virgin olive oil (VOO).",7612f34a-f3f7-4f70-890b-33079dba5332
19,methods19," In the present article, we found that HT and SQ, both minor compounds present in virgin olive oil (VOO), have antitumor effects on highly invasive breast cancer cells only when they act in combination, but not when they act independently. HT is one of the main phenols present in virgin olive oil (VOO) with interesting health benefits [11,12,13,14]. On the other hand, SQ, another important compound present in virgin olive oil (VOO)s and olives, also has antitumor properties against several types of cancer, such as skin, breast and colon cancer [18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. Interestingly, both isolated compounds did not promote the inhibition of highly invasive breast cells in previous published works [17,26], but together at certain concentrations, appeared to promote the inhibition of breast cancer cells’ growth and apoptosis, as well as increasing DNA damage.",2045a71b-98d3-4292-8f0f-9e2d82f37c1f
20,methods20,"  The combination of HT and SQ showed high radical scavenging activity in the Diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and acid) diammonium salt tablets (CAS 30931 67 0 (ABTS) assays. Warleta et al. [26] showed that SQ does not present any radical scavenging activity in the Diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and acid) diammonium salt tablets (CAS 30931 67 0 (ABTS) tests. On the contrary, HT has been reported to be a potent scavenger of free radicals [10,16]; for this reason, the antioxidant activity observed in this study could be due to the antioxidant activity per se of HT (Table 1 and Table 2). Further, the higher free radical scavenger activity occurred when HT was at the highest concentration used in both assays (Diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and acid) diammonium salt tablets (CAS 30931 67 0 (ABTS)) regardless of the concentration of SQ, which reinforces the idea that HT is the compound responsible for this antioxidant effect.",166b3932-3269-4098-9a4f-45c6752bd67b
21,methods21,"  This antioxidant effect of both compounds in combination could be related to oxidative radical accumulation that collaborates with breast neoplastic transformation. In fact, reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) play a crucial role in tumor progression [35]. In this context, SQ is a potent intracellular antioxidant [36]. An experimental study showed that SQ is able to reduce basal and H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in human breast MCF10A cells, but not in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells [26]. Unless SQ could have a protective activity against tumor development, this “selective antioxidant sensitivity” of SQ remains unknown. Moreover, HT is a well-known antioxidant phenol present in virgin olive oil (VOO) but it is not able to reduce basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.",20933742-fb21-43d3-93e3-154b839dad72
22,methods22," Indeed, our group previously observed that in conditions of H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, it reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in a dose-dependent manner in these cancer cells [17]. According to that, our results showed that the combination of both HT and SQ did not reduce basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MDA-MB-231 cells; furthermore, when H2O2 was added, HT at 100 μM combined with SQ (from 0.01 to 100 μM) reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels.  Due to the above, once a high-stress microenvironment is present in breast cancer, a combination of both compounds is not able to induce higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which could promote the inhibition of breast cancer growth. It is well known that the formation of neoplasms promotes a higher stress microenvironment than that observed in normal states, and cancer cells are able to adapt their metabolism to the new stress conditions [35].",9348e1fe-185c-450d-ba0f-b969d11b0174
23,methods23," However, once they are adapted, a change in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (a small enhancement or decrease) could be derived from the inhibition of cancer growth, due to the lack of oxidative stress enzymes [35]. Interestingly, combination of HT–SQ is able to increase DNA damage in normal conditions (Table 4), which suggests that the combination of these two compounds could inhibit breast cancer growth, but with another pathway that is different from reactive oxygen species (ROS) management (Figure 4a). However, once a stress condition is induced in these cells (Table 4), the HT–SQ combination is able to reduce DNA damage, causing them to lose their antitumoral effect.  Indeed, an inhibition of proliferation was observed with HT–SQ at certain concentrations (Figure 2) as well as an apoptosis activity (Table 3), which reinforces the idea that the combination of both HT–SQ could be a useful tool to treat or even prevent some breast cancers.",6ee96a80-4b46-4629-8d0f-2b3f29c2f78a
24,methods24," These HT–SQ effects were not observed in our previous works [17,26], where the research was focused on their antitumoral effects as isolated compounds.  The antiproliferative activity of HT was previously described in human colon adenocarcinoma cells by Corona et al. [13]. HT exerts its antiproliferative effects through the inhibition of the 1/2 phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)) and a decrease in cyclin D1 expression [13]. This interesting activity of HT also was observed in human breast cancer cells. HT was capable of inhibiting cell proliferation in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells [16,37,38]. Extracts from dry olive mill residue with increasing contents of HT were a strong cell growth inhibitor [39]. We evaluated the antiproliferative effect of HT in MDA-MB-231 cells, but HT was found to only have a slight antiproliferative activity at 200 μM [17].",ea2e1e0e-81ea-4d58-8e3d-12bcc139b0bf
25,methods25," In contrast, SQ does not have any antiproliferative effect in MDA-MB-231 cells [26]. In the present work, we demonstrated that if HT was combined with SQ, the antiproliferative activity of HT appears at a lower concentration (100 μM) in these highly invasive breast cancer cells, but in combination with SQ.  The pro-apoptotic activity of HT has also been widely studied. Some authors described the apoptotic effect of HT in promyelocytic leukemia cells and colon adenocarcinoma cells [40,41]. HT also induces apoptosis in human breast MCF-7 cancer cells, but at higher concentrations tested than in the present study [38]. In our previous work, HT did not promote apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 [17]. Furthermore, SQ also did not exert pro-apoptotic activity in our previous studies [26]. Surprisingly, our results showed a pro-apoptotic activity of HT at 100 μM when it was combined with SQ, especially at high concentrations of SQ (10 and 100 μM) (Table 3).",6d1c73c5-6f64-4f73-8ab3-4f57fa97656b
26,methods26," In addition, the amount of HT required to induce apoptosis in tumor cells was found to be lower when combined with SQ. As we observed in cell proliferation assay, it seems that SQ potentiates the activity of HT in some way.  It seems clear that SQ is, in some way, capable of enhancing the pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative activities of HT in human breast tumor cells. Since the existing research on the biological properties of virgin olive oil (VOO) has focused on the study of isolated minority compounds, there are no references about how SQ could produce this interesting reinforcing effect. Nevertheless, Nakagawa et al. [42] observed that several anticancer agents such as Adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin and cis-dichlorodiamminoplatinum potentiated their antitumor activity when they were combined with SQ. The synergism of SQ with anticancer agents has also been described in vivo.",2f761b7e-5271-40c7-87bf-5a71fc41623b
27,methods27," SQ is able to potentiate the antitumor activity of 3-[(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl) methyl]-1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (ACNU) in a tumor murine model of leukemia, maybe by a modification of membrane permeability [43]. According to the authors, the synergism of SQ and antitumor agents may be due to the accumulation of anticancer drugs inside the cell because it interferes with drug efflux [43]. The anti-carcinogenic effects of SQ have been investigated together with Geranylgeranoic acid in murine models and it has been suggested that they could be due to the accumulation of FPP [21,22,23]. To our knowledge, only Bullon et al. [44] described the effects of HT and SQ in periodontal disease, where both compounds reversed gingival vascular damage after atherosclerotic diet, but there are no scientific data in cancer disease.  Unfortunately, the apoptotic and antiproliferative effects of HT–SQ combination only occur at high and non-physiological concentrations.",60501c02-3790-4980-8e3e-988d6cc6b86a
28,methods28," However, as seen before, when HT is combined with SQ, the concentration of HT needed to maintain these antitumoral effects is dramatically reduced, compared to previous reports [17]. In fact, Yamaguchi et al. [40] claimed that the combination of anticancer agents with membrane-active molecules such as SQ could decrease the needed dose of anticancer drugs. Nowadays, the physiological concentration of HT after the ingestion of virgin olive oil (VOO) remains unclear, but it could be between 10 and 100 μM [45]. In addition, SQ has the advantage that it is another minority compound that is naturally present in virgin olive oil (VOO). It is also present in animal cells, as a cholesterol biosynthesis intermediate. Therefore, the consumption of HT and SQ could be achieved by the Mediterranean diet, including virgin olive oil (VOO) as the main fat.  5.",8189094b-a4c8-472a-9a87-6293846b7660
29,methods29," Conclusions  The low risk of breast cancer associated with virgin olive oil (VOO) intake may be a consequence of the synergistic activity of different minor compounds rather than the action of an individual compound. HT and SQ are two minor compounds present in virgin olive oil (VOO) that possess antitumor activity on highly invasive breast tumor cells when acting together. However, we cannot extrapolate in vitro results to human populations; for this reason, further studies are needed to confirm its possible preventive role. ",0eb2c1df-ebde-4957-9d33-8015d42c217b
