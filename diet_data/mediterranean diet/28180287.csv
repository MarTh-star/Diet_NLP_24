1,methods1," Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Samples ′Brava′ and ′Mansa′ are two ancient cultivars recently identified from northwestern Spain [37]. Olives were carefully harvested in November 2016 in a cultivation area located between two municipalities, Ribas do Sil (42°27′59.8′′ N 7°17′15.8″ W) and Quiroga (42°29′04.8′′ N 7°12′33.4′′ W), placed at Lugo province (NW Spain). Olive fruits were grown under organic agricultural practices. The trees were in dry condition, and subscriber and sanitary techniques suitable for cultivation in the studied area controlled their nutritional and sanitary status.  Two monovarietal olive oils from ′Brava′ and ′Mansa′ cultivars, separately, were obtained under optimal conditions with an OLIOMIO 50 (Oliomio, Conegliano, Italy), equipped with a knife crusher, a horizontal malaxator and a two-phase decanter. The malaxation trials were carried out for 45 minutes, and a temperature of 18 ± 2 °C for both varieties on two consecutive days.",5c7aa657-cee8-4bb2-93af-f6d94b298a11
2,methods2," Once in the laboratory, three different bottles of 500 mL from each variety were pooled and homogenized to obtain a final representative sample prior to analysis. The samples were kept at a constant temperature of 4 °C until analysis using amber bottles without headspace.  Both monovarietal oils were classified as extra virgin, considering that their quality indices (physicochemical and sensory quality parameters) fell within the ranges established by legislation [38].  4.3. Phenolic Compounds Analysis Phenolic compounds were extracted, by duplicate, from EVOOs according to the methodology proposed by Bajoub et al. [39]. Identification and quantification of polyphenols were performed according to the LC-ESI-IT-MS procedures described by Figueiredo-González et al. [32].  4.4. In Vitro Enzyme Inhibition. Potential Neuroprotective Activity In parallel with rich-phenol extracts from EVOOs, the activity of a refined sunflower oil (refined sunflower oil (RSO)) was also assessed.",be17c219-81ac-48b8-a32c-38b289185d97
3,methods3," refined sunflower oil (RSO) does not contain phenolic compounds and can be considered as a blank matrix to evaluate the effect of bioactive compounds.  Cholinesterases. Inhibition of AChE and BuChE was assessed according to a previously described methodology [40]. Briefly, the extract dissolved in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) or only buffer A without extract (negative control) was added to each well, together with acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI) or butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTCI). Then, dithiobis (2 nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 8) were added. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm in a LT-5000 MS ELISA READER (Labtech.com, Palaiseau, France). The rates of reactions were calculated after addition of AChE (0.44 U mL−1 in buffer B) or of BuChE (0.10 U mL−1 in buffer B). Galantamine was used as positive control.   Lipoxygenase.",f09152c9-c828-4697-9b05-fb3c58f70568
4,methods4," The inhibitory effect on 5-LOX was assessed in 96-well plates, using a previously documented procedure [41]. Briefly, 20 μL of extracts, 200 μl of phosphate buffer (pH 9) and 20 μL of 5-LOX (100 U) were added to each well. After 5 min of pre-incubation at room temperature, the reaction was started by addition of 20 μL of linoleic acid (4.18 mM in ethanol). The reaction time was 3 min. The absorbance was measured at 234 nm in a FLUOstar Omega Microplate Reader—BMG LABTECH (Weston, FL, USA). Quercetin was used as positive control.  Monoamine oxidases. Inhibition of hMAO-A and hMAO-B was assessed according to a methodology that has been described before by [1]. Concisely, a mixture of kynuramine and the extract dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) or just buffer (negative control) was incubated for 10 min, at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding of hMAOs (17 U mL−1) and the mixture was further incubated at 37 °C for 70 min.",bb689813-34e3-46eb-9440-86f39371a22f
5,methods5," Afterwards, the reaction was stopped by the addition of NaOH 2 N and the absorbance was measured at 314 nm using a spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, DU 730, USA, Life Science UV/Vis spectrophotometer). Clorgyline was tested as positive control.   4.5. Multivariate Statistical Analysis The IC50 values were calculated from three independent assays, each of them performed in triplicate, and all results are presented as mean values. Values obtained were compared using unpaired t-test (GraphPad Prism 6 Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Differences at p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, as well as Pearson partial correlations between both sets of variables: IC50 and phenolic concentrations.  A cluster analysis to group variables, both IC50 and phenolic concentrations, based on the squared Euclidean similitude distance by Ward′s method [42] together with discriminant analyses to separate EVOOs by means of IC50 values were also performed at a p < 0.",f0f2e0b0-5618-4776-af44-f0cf6233fc07
6,methods6,"05 with the statistical software package Statgraphics Centurion XVI from StatPoint Technologies Inc. (Warrenton, VA, USA).   PLS is a method for relating two data matrices, IC50 (Y matrix) and phenolic concentrations (X matrix), through a linear multivariate model, performed with The Unscrambler soft from CAMO. The idea is to relate a matrix of responses Y to the predictor variables of matrix X. To this end, matrix X is successively deflated; PLS seeks the directions in the X and Y-spaces corresponding to the maximum covariance. In this way, PLS forms principal components as linear combinations of the original variables, which are then related to the samples scores via a linear model. By plotting the principal components, one can view interrelationships between different variables sets (IC50 and phenolic concentrations), and detect and interpret sample patterns, groupings, similarities or differences.  5.",d5101a62-2a34-4bca-9031-2638a02c38d9
7,methods7," Conclusions This work successfully demonstrates, for the first time, that rich-phenolic extracts obtained from Galician EVOOs could act as multi-target ligands directly inhibiting central nervous system (CNS)-related enzymes. Although both EVOOs exhibited a weaker activity than that of the positive controls, they were able to inhibit simultaneously BuChE, 5-LOX, hMAO-A and hMAO-B, in a dose-dependent manner. Only ′Brava′ oil also showed a dual inhibition against both cholinesterase enzymes, which could imply increase the efficacy of the treatment of several disorders affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, the oils could be potential candidates in developing medicinal preparations and nutraceutical or functional foods for these disorders.   According to Pearson′s correlation test, the phenolic compounds with a greater influence on BuChE, 5-LOX and hMAOs inhibition were some secoiridoids derivatives, lignans and vanillic acid.",53a85265-a533-4c4d-a8f9-b8487f052f80
8,methods8," Although the cell-free model assays cannot be simply extrapolated to in vivo, they must be interpreted as easy and fast tools for a first approach. Thus, this work provides an approximation more on the nutraceutical properties of the EVOO phenolics, a valuable potential yet to be explored. In this regard, clinical trials are needed to provide a broader insight on the structure–activity relationship of olive oil polyphenols. ",c8509f91-ac59-4431-83ba-728a54365f73
