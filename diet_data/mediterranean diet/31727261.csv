The samples were again centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 3 min to precipitate unwanted DNA. For first-strand cDNA synthesis, reverse transcription (RT) of the purified RNA samples was performed using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis kit. Briefly, in each well of the 96-well PCR plates, 5 µL of the DNA-free supernatant was combined with 9 µL of nuclease-free water and 6 µL of advanced reaction mix reverse transcriptase cocktail. Lastly, the PCR plates were subjected to the RT reaction as follows: RT for 20 min at 46 °C, and RT inactivation for 1 min at 95 °C. The obtained cDNA for each sample was kept in a −80 °C freezer for later PCR run.  2.7.3.

The average of IC50 +/− standard error of the mean (SEM) of the biological replicates was calculated on an Excel sheet. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution acquisition and data analysis were presented using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Gene expression quantification was analyzed using the CFX 3.1 Manager software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The significance of the difference was determined using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test.

The dose–response curve implies a higher sensitivity (~2-fold more) of MDA-MB-468 cells to the compound, compared with its counterpart cell line, MDA-MB-231 (IC50 = 492.45 ± 3.28 µM for MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 1A) and 266.5 ± 5.24 µM for MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 1B) at a 48 h exposure period. A highly significant cytotoxic effect (p < 0.0001) was also identified in both cell lines, at 100–700 µM in MDA-MB-231 and 100–400 µM in MDA-MB-468. A small but significant decrease in cell viability was also detected in MDA-MB-468 cells at 50 µM (p ˂ 0.01).  3.2.",535848a5-ab89-4917-ace4-6f697770cc40
12,methods12," Oleuropein Inhibition of the Growth Rate in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells The antiproliferative effects of OL were assessed using AB® assay to measure the indirect cytotoxic effect of the compound at a longer exposure period as implied by the reduced growth rate in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. The antiproliferative effects of the compound were demonstrated in a dose- and time-dependent response compared to the control cells (Figure 2). Overall, the data obtained were consistent with the viability study data. MDA-MB-468 cells were more sensitive to the compound than MDA-MB-231 cells. In both tested cell lines, OL significantly inhibited cell proliferation (p < 0.0001) at the 72 and 96 h exposure periods vs. the control (Figure 2A,B). Furthermore, the compound induced antiproliferative effects at 72 vs. 96 h incubation periods. Meanwhile, the highly significant (p < 0.",116f9d1f-4c30-4db5-936a-c6dba4291ce2

Indeed, cell proliferation inhibition is verified by the decrease in the IC50 values from 159.70 to 92.43 µM in MDA-MB-468 cells and from 225.65 to 98.78 µM in MDA-MB-231 cells at the 72 vs. 96 h period of exposure. Interestingly, at the 96-h incubation period, the minor difference between the obtained IC50 values for both cell lines suggest a similar response to the compound.   3.3.",330d27e2-fcf4-4111-bb3c-6a4eae25b029
14,methods14," Oleuropein-Induced Cell Cycle Arrest in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells To comprehend the mechanism provoking the cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of OL, flow cytometric analysis using PI staining was performed to evaluate the early effect of the compound on cell cycle distribution after 48 h exposure at 0–400 µM in MDA-MB-231 (Figure 3A) and 0–150 µM in MDA-MB-468 (Figure 3B). The data show that DNA fluorescent content frequency histograms indicate the ability of OL to impact cell cycle progression. However, the two cell models showed a similar response; the susceptibility of MDA-MB-468 to the compound was ~3-folds higher than that for MDA-MB-231 cells. Notably, the three cell cycle phases were significantly affected (p < 0.05–p < 0.0001) in MDA-MB-468 cells at all tested OL concentrations. Meanwhile, MDA-MB-231 showed a significant response only at the highest tested concentration of the compound (400 µM). The data showed that the significant increase in S-phase (p < 0.",e0e78314-af5b-4a2e-a868-d27442c103a4
15,methods15,"0001) was accompanied by a decrease in G0/G1 (p < 0.001–p < 0.0001). Indeed, a more than 10% increase in S-phase was measured in both OL-treated cell types, compared to the control cells (34.69 ± 1.08 vs. 21.60 ± 0.35 in MDA-MB-231 and 36.85 ± 0.47 vs. 25.14 ± 0.49 in MDA-MB-468). These events were induced in MDA-MB-231 cells at 400 µM, accompanied by an increase in the number of dead cells (Sub G1, ~15%), as observed to the left of the G0/G1 peak in Figure 3A. Meanwhile, the same S-phase arrest was measured in MDA-MB-468 cells at 150 µM and resulted in a significant reduction in the G2/M phase (p < 0.01). Together with proliferation data, these results point to a different mechanism of OL in MDA-MB-468 that is more effective than the mechanism by which OL impacts the MDA-MB-231 cell line.  3.4.",1fb0be70-e190-4256-99f0-1ff401472802
16,methods16," Oleuropein-Stimulated Apoptotic Effect in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells Further flow cytometry study was conducted, using an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis kit to decipher a possible mechanism underlying the varied antiproliferative, cell cycle arrests, and possible apoptotic effect in OL-treated triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The apoptotic effect of OL at the 48-h exposure period in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines was assessed, as illustrated in Figure 4. The flowcytometric analysis suggested that apoptosis could be among the events leading to cell death. Indeed, the data showed a significant dose-dependent increase (p < 0.05–p < 0.0001) in the percentage of apoptotic cells compared with the untreated control (Figure 4A,B). The apoptotic effect (early and late apoptosis) of the compound was more profound in MDA-MB-468 cells (~4-fold-more) than its counterpart; MDA-MB-231 cells showed a slower increase in apoptosis.",e9c6528f-07f2-49cd-b205-2cbf2d2e6371
17,methods17," When exposed to 300 µM of OL, a profound 80% of the MDA-MB-468 cells were in the apoptotic phase; meanwhile, 25% of MDA-MB-231 cells analyzed exhibited apoptotic effects at 700 µM. While necrotic cells appeared in MDA-MB-231 cells, a negligible percentage of necrosis was detected in its counterpart, MDA-MB-468 cells. Thus, the obtained data suggested apoptosis as the anticipated primary mode of cell death in OL-treated MDA-MB-468 cells of the AA origin. On the other hand, MDA-MB-231 exhibited higher resistance to apoptosis and tended to undergo necrosis.  3.5. Gene Expression Alteration in OL-Treated Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells In further analysis, quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the transcriptomic level of apoptosis-related genes in OL-treated triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Each cell line was treated with a distinct concentration related to the IC50 value (500 µM in MDA-MB-231 cells and 250 µM in MDA-MB-468 cells, Figure 1).",332ef6aa-f685-41ae-a481-1a68a239377c
18,methods18," These chosen doses did not cause a considerable necrotic effect in the flow cytometry apoptosis analysis (Figure 4). Profiling the normalized mRNA expression for cells under investigation provided intuition into OL’s impact on various apoptosis-linked genes; however, we presented only the significantly altered mRNAs. Taken together, the red dots represent the upregulated genes (Figure 5A,B); meanwhile, the green dots refer to the downregulated genes that were observed only in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5A). For both cell lines, the black dots indicate the unchanged gene expression (Figure 5A,B).  Remarkably, MDA-MB-468 cells showed superiority over MDA-MB-231 cells regarding the number of altered genes and the fold-change (Table 1). Hence, the results may explain the higher anticancer potency of OL against MDA-MB-468 cells. A total of 14 genes expressed a significant increase (p < 0.05–p < 0.001) in their mRNA level (between 3.07 and 39.81-fold) upon MDA-MB-468 exposure to 250 µM of OL.",0c2d7be0-8020-4291-aa99-432f1087ea9f

The least upregulated three genes with a 3–4-fold increase were caspase 14 (CASP14), BCL-2 interacting protein 2 (BNIP2), and BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID)).  At 500 µM concentration level, oleuropein impacted the regulation of 8 genes in MDA-MB-231 cells (Table 1). However, the fold-change was smaller compared to its counterpart, MDA-MB-468 cells.

On the other hand, another four genes were downregulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily member 11B (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)RSF11B) being the most profoundly downregulated (−16.34-fold), followed by three slightly downregulated genes, including baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) repeat-containing 5 (baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)C5), pyrin domain (pyrin domain (PYD)), and caspase recruitment domain (caspase recruitment domain (CARD))-containing (PAYcaspase recruitment domain (CARD)), and caspase 6 (CASP6) was the least repressed (2.60-fold decrease).",9588279a-cafc-4438-9d17-865170a7779e
22,methods22,"   baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)C3 mRNA was the only significantly upregulated gene in both cell types; yet the fold increase in MDA-MB-468 cells was higher than that in MDA-MB-231 cells (5.50 vs. 3.18-fold). Our data constructively draw attention to the different response mechanisms exhibited by two racially different triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in response to OL.  4. Discussion The relationship between olive oil consumption and the reduced risk of breast cancer has been previously established [31,32]. Olive oil medicinal properties were attributed to its natural polyphenolic contents that have received considerable attention for their use as a cancer chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents [31,32]. The compound oleuropein (OL) is the most prominent polyphenol component of olives and leaves [8]. Meanwhile, the cell cycle-mediated apoptosis pathway is considered a rational approach for enhancing tumor sensitivity in coordination with anticancer agents [69].",854a66e2-d33f-48b2-8982-855415610e82
23,methods23," The current study provides an analysis of apoptotic proteins participating in the anticancer effect OL. The results suggest two markedly different mechanisms in altering apoptosis-related gene expressions between the two genetically different triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. These differences suggest that the specific therapeutic approach for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) must take into account the variability in the genetic background.   The data obtained in our study indicate the anticancer effects of OL in the two different triple-negative breast cancer (triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)) cell lines. The polyphenol OL was found to induce cytotoxic effects and inhibit the proliferation rate in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines. The cytotoxicity studies (Figure 1), proliferation assays (Figure 2), and cell cycle distribution analysis (Figure 3) indicated the different responses in these two cell lines.",067b298f-2fef-456d-ab0d-71ecea2446df
24,methods24," The results obtained show that MDA-MB-468 cells were more sensitive to OL than the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Compared to the currently used chemotherapy drugs, our recently published study [64] indicated the IC50 values for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells following 72 h of exposure to doxorubicin as 1.69 ± 0.11 and 0.23 ± 0.003 µM in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively. Even though the compound induced S-phase arrest in both cell lines, MDA-MB-468 cells were more susceptible to apoptosis compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4). Our gene analysis investigation demonstrated OL’s ability to impact a different subset of genes mediating apoptosis in these triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines (Figure 5).  Furthermore, the apoptosis-related genetic quantification indicates the higher vulnerability of MDA-MB-468 to OL than the MDA-MB-231 cell line, as indicated by a significantly higher fold-increase in the number of altered genes (Table 1).",087532cf-8924-4e10-88ae-736ccf3609cc
25,methods25," The ability of OL to suppress cell proliferation and stimulate apoptosis through S-phase cell cycle arrest in both cells is consistent with previous studies on BC cells at 200 µM [70]. Our data are also supported by a previous study that linked S-phase cell cycle arrest to particular apoptosis-related genes [71].  In the current study, the alteration of gene expression signature suggests the potency of OL to induce apoptosis through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Gene expression profiling in our study demonstrated that OL induced higher apoptosis-related transcriptional impacts in MDA-MB-468 cells than in MDA-MB-231 cells. Indeed, the most 14 significantly altered genes that were detected in MDA-MB-468 cells were all upregulated. In comparison, in MDA-MB-231, genes were altered with twice the concentration of OL used for MDA-MB-468.",7ce14739-4ac3-4cc0-8be1-88ad8748fa13
26,methods26," Our results suggest that OL caused differential gene expression changes to the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) gene, depending on the cell genotype.  Caspases, the cysteinyl aspartate proteases, naturally sustain cellular homeostasis by regulating apoptosis [72,73]. The data analysis from the current study revealed the impact of OL on different caspases. In MDA-MB-468 cells, OL predominantly upregulated CASP1, followed by CASP14. Instead, CASP4 was upregulated, while CASP6 was downregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells (Table 1). The three caspases, CASP1, CASP4, and CASP14, are apoptosis initiator caspases [74,75] that mediate the innate immune responses to cellular stress [76] and stimulate pyroptosis, a type of cell death [77,78]. On the other hand, CASP14 is involved in cornification, a unique type of programmed cell death other than apoptosis [79,80].",b6cc7ea0-e21a-4ea3-8f7a-c55df67f6ccf
27,methods27," We propose that the anticancer effect of OL on the MDA-MB-468 cell does not rely solely on apoptosis, but also pyroptosis and/or cornification mechanism could also be involved.  CASP1 is the most upregulated gene (39.81-fold) in OL-treated MDA-MB-468 cells. Unlike healthy breast cells, low expression of CASP1 in various types of cancer, including BC, is closely associated with decreased apoptosis and cancer cell enhancement [81]. On the contrary, upregulated CASP1 in fibroblasts induces apoptosis that precedes cell death [82]. Previous reports also suggested that CASP1 activates BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID) and is involved in the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway [83,84]. Hence, our results suggest the substantial contribution of CASP1 to the observed apoptotic effect in OL-treated MDA-MB-468 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and recommend CASP1 as a novel target in BC patients.",e05ce655-93b3-45e6-b216-fe27dfc0a5c5
28,methods28,"  In MDA-MB-231 cells, OL induced differential responses in CASP4 and CASP6 (Figure 6 and Table 1). Our finding is consistent with those previously reported the association between CASP4 and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic pathway [85,86,87]. Surprisingly, the downstream effector and executioner, CASP6, was downregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells and could be another reason for the weak apoptotic effect in OL-treated MDA-MB-231.  Four members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily (also known as death receptor, DR) were differently altered in OL-treated triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Inversely altered tumor necrosis factor (TNF)RSF10A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)RSF11B in MDA-MB-231 cells versus the highly upregulated mRNA in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)RSF21 and Fas associated via death domain (FADD) in MDA-MB-468 cells.",a0190437-c3b6-4fa7-883f-06c9bc1e5792
29,methods29," In our study, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)RSF11B was significantly downregulated in OL-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. This gene is expressed in various cancer types and is considered a prognostic marker in MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells [88]. tumor necrosis factor (TNF)RSF11B overexpression has multiple implications in cancer invasion, metastasis, as well as poor prognosis [89,90,91]. This gene also enhances cancer cell survival by resisting apoptosis induced by a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily known as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)) [90]. Therefore, the dramatic repression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)RSF11B expression is suggested to be the main contributor to the apoptotic effect in the OL-treated MDA-MB-231 cell line.",c10d021d-2dfe-4f84-9f48-d76b78836445
30,methods30,"   In MDA-MB-468 cells, the significantly upregulated Fas associated via death domain (FADD) receptor may be involved in the extrinsic and TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptotic pathway through caspase activation [92,93] and the vital role in BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID) cleavage [73]. Consistent with previous findings in BC [94], the upregulated expression of Fas associated via death domain (FADD) in MDA-MB-468 could mediate the observed S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The upregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)RSF21 (DR6), which appeared in the treated MDA-MB-468 cells under investigation, was previously reported to induce apoptosis [95,96], possibly through the mitochondria-mediating pathway and Bax interaction [97]. However, a slight but significant augmentation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)RSF10A (DR4) was measured in MDA-MB-231cells.",46c8534d-63f8-48dd-8c97-8a58a9cbd1d8
31,methods31," Consistent with the previous findings, the upregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)RSF10A could mediate cell cycle arrest, antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects [98,99].  Three members of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) family were significantly altered in OL-treated triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, including PYcaspase recruitment domain (CARD), BCL10, and Receptor interacting protein (RIP)K2. In MDA-MB-231 cells, a downregulation in PYcaspase recruitment domain (CARD) mRNA expression was detected. Low expression of PYcaspase recruitment domain (CARD) is detected in various types of cancers, including BC, and associated with tumorigenesis [100,101]. On the contrary, the ectopic expression of the gene promotes apoptosis, accompanied by DNA fragmentation and growth inhibition [102]. According to the previous study, PYcaspase recruitment domain (CARD) acts as an activator of CASP1 [103], the upstream positive regulator of CASP6-mediated cell death [104].",d03e4717-2a92-4802-a893-7a6bf8b966dd
32,methods32," The fact that implies the involvement of PYcaspase recruitment domain (CARD) attenuation in CASP6 inhibition. This study also shows that OL-treatment of MDA-MB-231 led to PYcaspase recruitment domain (CARD) downregulation and the consequential unchanged CASP1 expression. Another caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-contained gene, Receptor interacting protein (RIP)K2, was upregulated only in MDA-MB-231 cells. In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, particularly MDA-MB-231 cells, overexpression of Receptor interacting protein (RIP)K2 is a characteristic prognostic biomarker, and it is positively correlated with migration and metastasis and contributes to multidrug resistance [105]. Additionally, overexpression of Receptor interacting protein (RIP)K2 activates various cell signaling pathways, including NF-ƙB, JNK, and MAPKs [105,106,107].   In MDA-MB-468 cells, BCL10 mRNA was the only altered member of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) family.",a24a48f1-6fb5-4618-ab65-6768903662f7
33,methods33," The proapoptotic gene, BCL10 [108], triggers apoptosis by activating the apoptotic protease activating factor (Apaf-1)-caspase-9 pathway via a CASP8-independent mechanism [109]. Moreover, as an immune signaling adaptor, BCL10 mediates immune response and could trigger cell cycle arrest [110]. In BCL10-transfected BC cells, the overexpression of the gene was linked to apoptosis [109,111]. Collectively, our results are consistent with those previously reported.   Bcl-2 family members control mitochondrial membrane permeability and are crucial regulators of cell death and cell survival [112]. Four proapoptotic genes belonging to this family were upregulated in OL-treated MDA-MB-468 cells: BNIP2, BNIP3, and BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID), together with the dramatically upregulated CYCY, which possibly has a dual role (Table 1).",ad9fc289-a444-4a89-b301-d42372662aaf
34,methods34," The gene cytochrome c somatic (CYCS) can suppress the antiapoptotic proteins and activate the proapoptotic proteins of the BCL2 family, leading to an increase in the mitochondrial membrane permeability and allow more cytochrome c somatic (CYCS) release into the cytosol [113].   Structurally, the death-inducing mitochondrial BNIP proteins BNIP2 and BNIP3 are characterized by the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3). The most familiar member, BNIP3, also contains a C-terminal transmembrane hydrophobic domain, and both domains are vital in stimulating the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptosis pathway [114,115,116]. Given the previous literature, overexpressed BNIP3 induces both caspase-dependent [117] and caspase-independent apoptosis, and autophagy [118], in addition to caspases-independent necrosis-like cell death [119]. Furthermore, a relationship between the elevation of BNIP3 expression, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis was previously reported [120].",a385df82-41e2-425d-bb3f-4c8bf3bd89af
35,methods35," Similarly, the BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID) mRNA upregulation was measured in MDA-MB-468 cells, compared with the respective untreated controls (Table 1). The proapoptotic protein BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID) triggers the intrinsic apoptosis pathway through the permeabilizing mitochondrial membrane to facilitate apoptotic protein release such as cytochrome c somatic (CYCS) and activate caspases [121]. Further reports suggested the role of BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID) in DNA damage-stimulated apoptosis and S-phase cell cycle arrest [71,122]   The proapoptotic gene, GADD45A, was the second most upregulated gene in OL-treated MDA-MB-468 cells, after CASP1, which is a p53 and DNA damage response gene. As an inducible stress gene, GADD45A regulates many biological processes, including DNA repair, apoptosis induction, and cell cycle regulation [123,124].",538f448e-9a71-4430-a590-a4b491d59e75
36,methods36," Particularly in the aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, low expression of GADD45A was strongly associated with lacking the three hormonal receptors, ER, PR, and Her2 [125]. Our results are consistent with previous reports from others, where GADD45A has been shown to induce antiproliferative effects and S-phase cell cycle arrest [126] and activating both JNK and/or p38 MAPK signaling pathways [124,127]  On the other hand, a multidomain antiapoptotic gene, bifunctional apoptosis regulator (BFAR), was significantly upregulated in MDA-MB-468 cells (~21-fold). bifunctional apoptosis regulator (BFAR) was found to inhibit both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways to enhance cell growth [128]. In BC, an upregulation of bifunctional apoptosis regulator (BFAR) was observed after chemotherapy [129]. These findings may explain the increase in bifunctional apoptosis regulator (BFAR) mRNA, following MDA-MB-468 cells exposure to OL, as a resistance mechanism.",220b1afe-1a8b-456d-ac0b-dec548b222e4
37,methods37,"   Another upregulated antiapoptotic gene in OL-treated MDA-MB-468 cells is the B Raf proto oncogene (BRAF) gene that encodes serine/threonine-protein kinase B-RAF [130]. The mutated B Raf proto oncogene (BRAF) gene is a downstream effector in the MAPK signaling pathway, which controls many cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration [131]. The previous reports may be controversial about the B Raf proto oncogene (BRAF) effect in BC [132,133,134], even though more recent study presents the B Raf proto oncogene (BRAF) gene as an antiapoptotic agent, which could be exhibited in OL-treated MDA-MB-468 cells to resist apoptosis. However, to comprehend the anticipated mechanism of the B Raf proto oncogene (BRAF) gene in apoptosis, further molecular investigations are required.  In OL-treated MDA-MB-468 cells, a significant and high level of the antiapoptotic gene CASP8 and FADD like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) was expressed.",64af2528-8b5b-4b35-8ef1-1ae5e461f129
38,methods38," The gene CASP8 and FADD like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) has many isoforms with controversial roles, either as an apoptosis inducer [135,136] or inhibitors of the death-receptor-induced apoptosis pathway that prevented CASP8 activation [68,137,138]. Therefore, the increase in CASP8 and FADD like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) mRNA in our study without any significant alteration of CASP8 may support the later findings that suggest the antiapoptotic action of the gene. Moreover, OL altered the expression of the antiapoptotic survivin baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)C3 (cinhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)2) and baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)C5 (survivin). These two members of the inhibitor of apoptosis family (inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)) [139]—with their baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) repeat (baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)) domains—play a crucial role in controlling proliferation, differentiation, as well as apoptosis [140,141].",eaaba1d8-4993-4924-9db3-f9f512274bbb
39,methods39," In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)—MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468—elevated baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)C3 and baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)C5 were found, compared with the normal breast cells [142,143]. These proteins block the apoptosis pathway by inhibiting caspases activation [72,144], leading to aggressive tumorigenesis, metastasis, and a poor clinical outcome [145,146,147]. In our study, the baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)C3 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in both cell types under investigation. Interestingly, the baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)C3 upregulation in MDA-MB-231 was concomitant with repression in baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)C5, which leads to cell cycle arrest [148]. According to these previous reports, we suggest baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)C5 repression in MDA-MB-231 cells as an exhibition of submissive apoptosis.  5.",4104bff6-0c5e-47c7-87eb-810847ae555b
40,methods40," Conclusions  The current study demonstrated the molecular mechanism underlying the apoptotic effect of the polyphenolic compound oleuropein (OL) in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 6). The compound induced cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects accompanied by apoptosis in response to S-phase cell cycle arrest. Meaningfully, the variation in the molecular profiles between AA and CA BC patients—including protein and gene expressions, somatic mutations, somatic DNA copy number alteration (copy number alteration (CNA)), and DNA methylation patterns [149], might explain the obtained different genetic response to OL in the two cell lines under investigation. Nonetheless, MDA-MB-468 cells were remarkably more susceptible to the compound than MDA-MB-231 cells were.",43f650a2-aa60-4556-9639-2772300be701
41,methods41," In MDA-MB-468 cells, many apoptosis-involved genes with a dramatic higher fold increase were measured, including two members of the caspase family (CASP1 and CASP14), proapoptotic genes (GADD45A, BNIP2, BNIP3, BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID), and BCL10), two members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily (Fas associated via death domain (FADD) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)RSF21), in addition to cytochrome c somatic (CYCS) and CASP8 and FADD like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) genes. These genes were previously found to augment apoptosis by triggering intrinsic, extrinsic, or both apoptotic pathways (Figure 6).  For MDA-MB-231 cells, the upregulation of baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)C3, Receptor interacting protein (RIP)K2, and the downregulation of CASP6 and PYcaspase recruitment domain (CARD) interpret the weaker apoptotic effect in OL-treated cells.",16ff9842-6d8e-4aaf-b564-2646912e7fe7
42,methods42," However, apoptosis was mainly endorsed by the downregulation of the antiapoptotic gene tumor necrosis factor (TNF)RSF11B and the survivin baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)C5 and the minor upregulation of CASP4, even with alteration in genes resisting apoptosis induction (Figure 6). OL was found to overcome their effects and induced apoptosis in both triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell models.   As an in vitro investigation, our study has some limitations. While we examined the anticancer effect of OL in two different BC cells, this study did not investigate normal breast cells or include in vivo studies. The study also lacks measuring the impact of OL on protein levels to support our gene microarray assays. Furthermore, the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines studied, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, as basal-like 1 and mesenchymal, respectively—are structurally different.",38790a6e-e85a-4e5a-b3dd-64f05c4027c4
43,methods43," Despite these limitations, the study provided an overview of the molecular mechanisms of oleuropein in the two triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) genetically diverse cell lines. The results indicated that the two cell lines were markedly different in the anticancer effect and mechanisms of the ability of oleuropein to alter apoptosis-related gene expressions. The results obtained from this study should also guide the potential utilization of oleuropein as an adjunct therapy for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) to increase chemotherapy effectiveness and prevent cancer progression.
