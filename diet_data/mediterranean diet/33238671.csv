0,methods0," 2.1. The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS))  The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) is a prospective cohort with 41,513 participants living in Melbourne, recruited during the period between 1990 and 1994. Participants were recruited using the electoral roll and direct approach through clubs, churches and ethnicity-specific mass-media. The recruitment and follow-up of the cohort and data collection process has been detailed elsewhere [17]. Socio-demographic and dietary information was collected at baseline using interviewer-administered questionnaires. Anthropometric data were collected through physical measurements and blood samples collected. Follow-up surveys were conducted around 4 years after recruitment, between 1995 and 1998 (wave 1) and between 2003 and 2007 (wave 2).",85c7cd69-772b-47ce-be82-91d40ba31102
1,methods1," Of the 41,513 participants, 39,185 were eligible at baseline; of these, 34,444 were included in the first wave of follow-up and 25,888 were include in the second wave of follow-up (Figure 1). In the wave 1 follow-up data were collected either with a self-administered questionnaire or a questionnaire administered by interviewer over telephone. In the wave 2, the baseline information was updated using self-administered questionnaires and anthropometric (except height) measurements were repeated [17].  2.2. Dietary Assessment  A 121-item self-administered Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) [18] was used to collect dietary intake data. Sex-specific average portion sizes were assigned to each food item and daily frequencies of some fruits were seasonally adjusted. Nutrient composition data were derived largely from the Australian food composition tables [19].",ea77f762-f123-4685-aae0-b341b3067e36
2,methods2," In the case of unavailability in Australian tables data were derived from relevant British (Folate and vitamin) [20], Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology data (Fatty acids) [21] and the United States Department of Agriculture (Carotenoids) [22] sources as appropriate. Mean daily nutrient intakes were obtained by multiplying the daily frequency of each food item by the nutrient composition for an average sex-specific portion size. Comparisons of antioxidant and fatty acid intakes against plasma biomarkers for this Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) have been described previously [23,24]. Three diet scores were calculated from the estimated food and nutrient intakes. The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) was generated based on reviewing and scoring literature assessing the association between various dietary components including nutrients, spices and foods and six inflammatory biomarkers, giving a single score assessing anti- or pro-inflammatory potential of the overall diet [25].",6021bda1-acc0-411b-b8e7-f1ccd241f8a6
3,methods3," Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) values for Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) cohort participants were calculated using 29 of 45 possible foods and nutrients. The higher the score the more pro-inflammatory the diet. The AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 score is the sum of dietary component scores, ranging from 0 to 110 calculated for Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) data using the method described by Chiuve et al., based on the scientific evidence available at the time on the association between diet and health [26]. The higher the score the healthier the diet. The Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) assesses how closely the diet adheres to the traditional Cretan diet. The total score ranged from 0 to 9 with a higher score indicating stronger compliance with a traditional Mediterranean diet [27].  2.3.",22c71860-d559-424c-9c68-ee36b098e542
4,methods4," Socio Demographic and Comorbidity Data  Data on age, sex, country of origin, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity was collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires at baseline. According to country-of-origin participants were grouped into 1. Australia/New Zealand/other, 2. Northern European (primarily British) and 3. Southern European (Greek and Italian). Socioeconomic position was represented by deciles of Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA)) Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage based on postcode at baseline. Deciles of Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) were recoded into quintiles, the first being the most disadvantaged and the fifth being the most affluent. To assess physical activity, participants were asked how much time they spent on low, moderate and high levels of physical activity at home and at work, using a structured questionnaire.",673fcb2b-b355-4e16-af6f-1286161018bb
5,methods5," The responses were categorised as: none/week, 1–2 times/week; and ≥3 times/week, which were coded as 0, 1.5 and 4, respectively. An overall physical activity score was generated from the sum of scores from each category of activities, with high-intensity activity receiving double the weight of low-intensity activity and walking. The participant’s overall physical activity score was categorized into 4 approximate quartiles: 0; >0–4; >4–6 and >6. Self-reported health information covering diabetes and other comorbidities was collected.  2.4. Anthropometric Assessment Data  All anthropometric parameters (height, weight, waist and hip circumferences) were measured at baseline following standard procedures [17]. Weight was measured to 100 g using digital electronic scales, height to 1 mm using a stadiometer, and waist and hips circumferences were measured to 1 mm using a 2-m metal anthropometric tape.",4c2a251d-7f1c-4a79-b629-8b836f647675
6,methods6," Weight and body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) calculated and classified as follows: body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 (overweight), body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 (obese), and waist to hip ratio (WHR) ≥ 0.90 cm (male); ≥0.85 cm (female) elevated risk.  2.5. Diabetes Ascertainment  At baseline people who reported having been diagnosed with diabetes or who had elevated blood glucose: fasting > 7.0 mmol/L or non-fasting > 11.0 mmol/L, were considered to have diabetes and were not eligible for the analysis. At both follow-up surveys participant were asked if they had been diagnosed with diabetes, if they answered yes to this question, they were considered to have incident diabetes.  2.6. Statistical Analysis  The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) scores were divided into 5 groups of equal size using quintile cut points derived from the whole sample.",45829ee7-7632-4078-a8c1-ca4145e71890
7,methods7," The lowest of the groups representing the most anti-inflammatory/healthiest diet for Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and least healthy diet for AHealthy Eating Index (HEI). The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was classified into 3 categories with scores of 0–3; 4–6; and 7–9. Univariate associations of baseline characteristics and the dietary indices were evaluated using one-way ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-squared test for categorical variables. Cumulative incidences of diabetes at waves 1 and 2 were compared across predictor categories. Associations of baseline dietary indices [Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) with incident diabetes adjusting for plausible confounders were assessed through fitting multivariable Poisson regression models [28] using robust error variance [29].  Incidence Rate Ratio (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)) and 95% confidence intervals were generated fitting four graduated models.",818775f1-075f-4651-8235-51917ff38a85
8,methods8," Model 1 was fitted adjusting for set of plausible confounding variables; Age, sex, Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) (quintiles 1–5), smoking status (never, former and current), drinking status (never, former and current), family history of diabetes and physical activity level (0, >0 and <4, ≥4 and <6, ≥6). Model 2 was fitted adjusting for variables of model 1 plus body mass index (BMI), Model 3 was fitted adjusting for variables of model 2 plus waist to hip ratio (WHR) and model 4 additionally adjusted for region of origin. The interaction between dietary pattern and region of origin on the risk of type 2 diabetes was estimated by including a multiplicative term between the two variables in the generalized estimating equation models. As it was statistically significant, we examined the association of dietary pattern with type 2 diabetes stratified by region of origin.",09e84c8e-7f36-49d0-8d8e-d6c8b620bce9
9,methods9,"  In addition, first order interaction effects between dietary indices and sex, age, and waist to hip ratio (WHR) at baseline were investigated. Interaction effects between none of the pairs appeared significant (p > 0.05), and their inclusion did not improve model performance; therefore, only the main effects were retained in the final models. Trends across quantiles of dietary indices were estimated by giving each person in that quantile the median score for the quantile.  We fitted mediation models using body size (either body mass index (BMI)/waist to hip ratio (WHR)) as a mediator of the relationship between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)/AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) and type 2 diabetes [30,31]. We did not include Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in the mediation analysis, as there was no evidence of an association between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and diabetes.",9c2dc5b2-2a64-4c63-a882-c171eb33db73
10,methods10," The controlled direct effect (controlled direct effect (CDE)) is the average effect of an increase in Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)/AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) neither due to mediation nor interaction and the natural indirect effect (natural indirect effect (NIE)) effect only due to mediation. The total effect is the product of the controlled direct effect (CDE) and natural indirect effect (NIE) [32,33]. The proportion mediated was calculated using the following formula [(controlled direct effect (CDE) × (natural indirect effect (NIE) − 1)]/[(controlled direct effect (CDE) × natural indirect effect (NIE)) − 1] [34].  All statistical analyses were performed using Stata/SE release 16 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).  2.7.

11,methods11," The current study received approval from the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee.  3. Results  Of the 41,513 participants recruited to the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS), 2328 (1548 with diabetes and 780 missing demographics, body size or diet data) were excluded. Of 39,185 included at baseline, 34,444 attended wave 1 (1655 died between baseline and wave 1 and 3086 were lost to follow-up). Among the wave 1 participants, 25,888 attended wave 2 (740 had already developed diabetes between wave 1 and wave 2, 3541 died between wave 1 and wave 2, 4275 did not attend wave 2) (Figure 1). The average age of the participants at baseline was 55.2 ± 8.7 years and 59.7% were female. Among the participants, 69.8% were born in Australia, 23.8% were of southern European origin and another 6.5% were of northern European origin.",0cffe515-2d11-4ef7-83bc-f6bd1a69ee79
12,methods12,"  At wave 1, participants with diets in the most pro-inflammatory quintile (Q5) of Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) were more likely to be younger, female, disadvantaged (Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) Q1–Q3), of Southern European origin, smokers, less physically active (score < 4), have a higher waist to hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI). Alcohol consumption showed an inverted U-shaped distribution (least in Q1 and Q5) across Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) quintiles (Table 1a). Participants in the least adherent quintile (Q1) of AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 were more likely to be male, disadvantaged (Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) Q1-Q3), smokers, never consume alcohol, less physically active (score < 4) and have higher waist to hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI) (Table 1b).",3a494103-6b4a-47fe-8c08-4d915744a841
13,methods13," Participants in the least adherent tertile (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) 1) of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were more likely to be disadvantaged (Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) Q1–Q3), less physically active (score < 4) and have higher waist to hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI). Family history of diabetes and proportion of people with comorbidities were evenly distributed across categories of dietary indices (Table 1c).  A total of 740 people had developed diabetes at wave 1 and an additional 1249 had developed diabetes by wave 2. The incidence of diabetes increased with increasing age, decreasing Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) and physical inactivity. The incidence of diabetes was higher among females, southern Europeans, smokers, those with higher body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR), positive family history, and one or more comorbidities. The lowest diabetes incidence was seen for current alcohol consumers.",2f2af572-bbb8-4898-9fa7-b0386d431b25
14,methods14," Diabetes incidence increased across Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) quintiles and decreased across AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) quintiles. The diabetes incidence varied little across Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) tertiles, revealing a U-shaped pattern. The trends were consistent across waves 1 and 2 of follow-up (Table 2).  Table 3 presents the associations of dietary indices at baseline with diabetes incidence from multi-variable Poisson regression models. Baseline Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) was positively associated with diabetes incidence in model 1 after adjusting for age, sex, Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA), smoking status, drinking status, family history of diabetes and physical activity level (p trend < 0.001). Only quintile 5, the most pro-inflammatory diet, showed significant association after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) [Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 1.25; 95% CI 1.08, 1.43, model 2; p trend = 0.",170b4973-336b-4e35-8eeb-30d5a9d61b68

However, after adjusting for region of origin (model 4) the association with Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) became non-significant (p trend = 0.402). Only quintile 5 (most adherent diet quintile) of AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 at baseline showed a significant association with diabetes [Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 0.67; 95% CI 0.58, 0.78;] in model 1 and there was a significant trend (p < 0.001) across quintiles. The association persisted after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) [Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 0.75; 95% CI 0.65, 0.87 p trend < 0.001] and additional adjustment for waist to hip ratio (WHR) [Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 0. 78; 95% CI 0.67, 0.91; p trend = 0.003] and region of origin [Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 0.73; 95% CI 0.63, 0.85; p trend < 0.001].",50240da7-47b9-463a-a1d2-316cbeece609

Increasing AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) was associated with lower diabetes risk, and 43% of the effect was explained by a substantial indirect effect through waist to hip ratio (WHR), 35% of the effect was explained by a substantial indirect effect through body mass index (BMI).  4. Discussion  In the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS), healthier diets defined by low inflammation potential or closer adherence to the US dietary guidelines were associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes incidence. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) showed no clear association with diabetes risk.",6743e692-a37a-4981-8d67-260a0f61706d
19,methods19," Associations for AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) were independent of body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR), but Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) no longer showed an association after adjusting for region of origin. In analyses stratifying by country of origin, the associations for AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) were seen only in the Australian and New Zealand origin subgroup which made up 70% of the participants included in the analysis. Mediation analysis indicated that a substantial proportion of these associations was mediated through body mass index (BMI) or waist to hip ratio (WHR).  We have previously investigated the prospective associations of the three diet scores Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and the development of obesity [16].",e5a3e32b-cf9e-40bd-afe7-a3f4ee4adf94
20,methods20," We found that healthier diets estimated by all three scores were associated with lower waist to hip ratio (WHR) at wave 2, while only Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 were associated with body mass index (BMI). Overall, AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 appeared to have the strongest association with body size measurements at wave 2. In the present study, AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) were associated with diabetes incidence independent of body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR), although the associations were attenuated after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and less by the further addition of waist to hip ratio (WHR).",4ba6f015-6deb-49d5-b1fc-7bb5ea979427
21,methods21," Our analyses showed that body size mediated between 35% and 48% of the association between diet scores and diabetes for both Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, somewhat lower than the 58% of association between an earlier version of Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and diabetes mediated by body mass index (BMI) in the E3N cohort [35]. There are several differences between the E3N and Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) cohorts that could result in the various contributions of body size to the association between diet scores and diabetes risk, including that E3N participants were all women while the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) participants in our analysis were 40% men. However, we did not observe effect modification of the associations between diet scores and diabetes by sex in our study. Mean body mass index (BMI) in E3N was 23 kg/m2 while in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) it was 27 kg/m2.",aae3d7dd-58b6-469c-af65-45e39477814f
22,methods22," Age at baseline was similar at 53 years for E3N and 55 years for Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS).  The stratified analysis showed that for the Australia- and New Zealand-born participants the association between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) or AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and diabetes risk was strong, and consistent with the overall results, but there was no association in the European migrant subgroups. The northern European subgroup was relatively small, with around 2500 people and 100 cases, which may not have conferred sufficient statistical power to find associations.",107aa206-f8c9-49e2-bf89-5d29f42ab499
23,methods23," We have performed a validation study in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) for the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) used at wave 2, finding that the performance of the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) was poorer for the southern European migrants than the Australian-born participants [36], which, if reflected in the baseline, Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) reporting may contribute to the lack of association observed. It is also possible that because of the differences in diet between country-of-origin groups, the foods consumed for the same dietary scores are not consistent and may vary in their potential beneficial effects  Schwingshackl et al. [37] reviewed the association between 12 food groups that are the basis of many dietary indices: whole grains/cereals, refined grains/cereals, vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, eggs, dairy products, fish, red meat, processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages.",5111b2e6-267d-49a7-b775-5e5934a8e125
24,methods24," Inverse associations were found for whole grain, dairy and fruit, and positive associations for processed meat, red meat and sugar sweetened beverages. Different weights for these different food groups in the scoring algorithms may explain the different associations between diet scores and diabetes. For example, Schwingshackl et al. found dairy to be inversely associated with diabetes risk, but in the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) a point is allocated for having an intake of dairy products below the median, and sugar sweetened beverages are not scored in this index, which may contribute to the lack of association seen in our study for Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS).  Diabetes is understood to be a pro-inflammatory disorder [9], so healthy diets that reduce inflammation could potentially decrease risk. A Mediterranean diet has been shown to reduce circulating inflammatory biomarkers concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers (C reactive protein (CRP), IL-6.",7d18a952-7480-46bf-ac00-2ca7bcb11d58

Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) is, by design, correlated with inflammatory biomarkers [25] and this has been confirmed in numerous (i.e., over 35) different studies [39,40,41]. AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) has also been shown to be inversely associated with inflammatory markers concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers (C reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 [42], thus each of the diet indices assessed here may work to some degree through inflammatory pathways. In a previous study of Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) participants we observed a moderate positive rank correlation between the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 (Spearman ρ = 0.49), and moderate negative rank correlations for the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) with each of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 (ρ = −0.44, and ρ = −0.",784bfa3a-1f40-4002-8138-9f626ddee121
26,methods26,"28, respectively) [42].  A major strength of our study is the use of a large dataset and a prospective study design with adjustment for many plausible confounders. We included 1989 incident cases of diabetes. Our study used three diet scores with different theoretical bases and reached similar conclusions for Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, with better diets associated with lower risk of diabetes. Also, we had anthropometric measurements rather than relying on self-reported measures often used in similar large datasets.  There were several limitations of our study. We used self-reported dietary data from an Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), which are known to measure intake with considerable error. Only 29 of 45 components of Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) were available to be included for this study, which may limit comparison of the findings with other similar studies using different dietary variables.",91ad4a48-a725-426c-8aa8-f250ebbdeeab
27,methods27," However, from over 350 peer reviewed publications, the average number of food parameters used to calculate the scores was 27. Physical activity data were self-reported, and the questions were not as detailed as in instruments commonly used today, such as IPAQ [43]. Diabetes diagnosis was also self-reported, although at the first follow-up, we confirmed the diagnosis with participant’s nominated doctor. Of doctors we could contact, 76% of incident diabetes cases were confirmed as type 2 diabetes [44]. We also assumed all incident cases were type 2 diabetes given the age of study participants. Diabetes diagnosis was not based on population screening therefore may be confounded by factors associated with health service usage, as data from the 2011–2012 Australian Health Survey suggests that there was approximately one newly diagnosed case of diabetes for every four diagnosed cases [45].",5c76164f-de49-48f2-8b4f-667f467927ad
28,methods28," The numbers within country of birth strata were small and attendance at follow-up 2 was lower for Greek born participants who had the highest incidence of diabetes at the first follow-up [46].  5. Conclusions  Overall, our results were consistent with other prospective studies showing that better quality diets as assessed by various indices were associated with reduced diabetes risk. In the current study the association between dietary indices was mediated by body size but there was also a component of the association that was independent of the association with body size measures. As with our previous study looking at body size outcomes, the association appears to be slightly more consistent for AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 than Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and there no association was seen for the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS).",a1a478b8-4edb-414e-a21a-cb4e33697aba
29,methods29," AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) may be a practical way to assess diet quality in relation to diabetes risk, further work to assess the use of AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 to design dietary interventions in RCTs would be valuable.  6.
