0,introduction0," Health, quality of life and physical activity (PA) are strongly interrelated1. Chronic disease factors, such as a sedentary lifestyle, are present not only in adults but also in children and adolescentsas well2. Increasing the incidence of these diseases is directly linked to lifestyle changes, specifically PA behaviors, eating habits and smoking3. Less physically active children are more expected to possess risk factors for cardiometabolic disease such as a lower level of HDL-C, higher blood pressure, increased serum insulin levels and excess fat1,4,5. Therefore, it is essential to promote PA programs early in life to prevent such diseases. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)) is essential for disease prevention and health promotion5. Children and adolescents should spend a minimum of 60 min per day in Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)6.",1d4990a7-9021-4bef-9f2e-193f2ecdab60
1,introduction1,"    Lifestyle factors could interact with each other in an antagonistic or synergistic way to influence PA status, so it is important to investigate the association of PA with several potentially modifiable lifestyle factors (such as dietary habits, sedentary activities, sleeping status, physical fitness, and obesity status) considered simultaneously1,7-23. Even though, several studies have explored the association of sleeping hours7-9, screen time10-12, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) status13-15, physical fitness (PF)16-18 and dietary habits19-23 with PA among schoolchildren, only a few have included all these factors, simultaneously in multivariate models. Moreover, most studies have included a specific age range of participants; thus these results may not be accurate to the whole of children and adolescents, in both sexes.",2041a0c2-e049-4d3a-afa8-f70002826140
2,introduction2," Specifically, several studies have observed no consistent associations between PA and sleep duration7-9, while, screen time was inversely associated with PA, among children10-12. Moreover, though PA is an accepted strategy in the treatment of established childhood obesity, the role of PA in the prevention of obesity is less apparent12-15. Additionally, numerous studies among schoolchildren have speculated that PA was positively and well correlated with aerobic fitness16-18 and directly associated with healthy dietary habits19-23.    Thus, we aimed to explore the association between PA status and several lifestyle characteristics taking into consideration numerous potential confounders using data from a large, population-representative study in Greek schoolchildren aged 8-17 yr old.  ",35283355-0c12-4fea-bafe-2a410b4d2b53
3,methods0," Population data were derived from a school-based health survey carried out in 2015 on 177,091 (51% boys) Greek children aged 8 to 17 yr old. PA, sedentary activities and sleeping habits were assessed through self-completed questionnaires. Dietary habits were evaluated using the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index for children and adolescents. Anthropometric and physical fitness measurements were obtained by trained investigators. Logistic regression models were estimated and adjusted for relevant covariates.     Participants   Population-based, representative data were derived from a nation-wide school-based health survey in Greece. Specifically, anthropometric, nutrition, PA, sedentary habits, and PF data along with information on age and sex were collected from Mar 2015 to May 2015. Overall, 177091 (51% boys and 49% girls) children aged 8-17 yr old agreed to participate in the study.    Parents were informed in writing for the purposes of this school health survey.",98b5a206-de5a-4a0b-b868-aaae3203b8b5
4,methods1," Verbally informed consent for the child to participate in the measurements was obtained from Physical Education (PE) teachers.    As the measurements were included in an obligatory school curriculum, verbal informed consent by the students was considered sufficient. The working sample was representative of the entire Greek population. Participation rate was almost 40% of the total population (chi-square P-value as compared to the current sample with the age-sex distribution of all Greek areas = 0.93).    Assessment of demographic and anthropometric data   Demographic information of students was obtained from each school headmaster. Children’s height, body weight, and waist circumference were measured in the morning, using a standardized procedure. body mass index (BMI) status (e.g. normal weight, overweight, obese) was classified using the International Obesity Task Force age- and gender-specific body mass index (BMI) cut-off criteria24.",312c470f-3fa6-4b43-b0da-28e307e6201d
5,methods2," For the purposes of the present study, we compared normal-weight with overweight (including obese) participants. Central obesity was defined as waist circumference (cm) -to-height (cm) ratio (WHtR) ≥0.525. PE professionals performed all anthropometric measurements.    Assessment of physical fitness levels   The Euro-fit PF test battery was used to evaluate children's PF levels26. The battery consists of 5 tests, i.e. (a) a multi-stage 20 m shuttle run test (20 m SRT), to estimate aerobic performance; (b) a maximum 10×5 m shuttle run test (10×5 m SRT) to evaluate speed and agility; (c) a sit-ups test in 30 sec (SUs), to measure the endurance of the abdominal and hip-flexor muscles; (d) a standing long jump (standing long jump (SLJ)), to evaluate lower body explosive power; and (e) a sit and reach (SR) test to measure flexibility.",3922bf3a-5df4-476e-bb54-dfdbb235892d
6,methods3," Moreover, schoolchildren were classified into low and healthy cardiorespiratory fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)) levels, which proposed cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) cut points to avoid cardiovascular disease risk for boys and girls aged 8- to 18-yr, respectively27.    Assessment of dietary habits   Participating in children’s dietary, PA and sedentary habits were recorded via an electronic questionnaire that was completed at school with the assistance of their teachers. Students’ dietary habits were assessed with the use of a valid and reliable questionnaire, namely KIDMED (Mediterranean Diet Quality Index for children and adolescents)28. This index contains 16 yes or no questions, including dietary habits that are in accordance with the principles of the MD dietary pattern and the general dietary guidelines for youth, and habits that undermine them.",b0861e71-289f-4312-b47c-6290aabce534
7,methods4," Questions denoting a negative connotation with respect to a high-quality diet are assigned a value of −1, while those with a positive aspect are assigned a value of +1. Thus, the total KIDMED score ranges from 0 to 12 and is classified into 3 levels: ≥8, suggesting an optimal adherence to the MD (sufficient dietary habits); 4–7, suggesting an average adherence to the MD and an improvement needed to adjust dietary intake to guidelines (relatively sufficient dietary habits); and ≤3, suggesting a low adherence to the MD and generally a low diet quality (insufficient dietary habits).    Assessment of self-reported physical activity and sedentary time   Patterns of PA and sedentary time were also self-reported. The questionnaire applied has been previously validated and used in children in other large-scale epidemiological studies29.",1db92586-6640-4fe4-a6f5-d79e09654932
8,methods5," It includes simple closed-type questions regarding children’s type, frequency, time and intensity of participation in (i) school-related PA (including activity during PE classes; (ii) organized sports activities and (iii) PA during leisure time. The frequency of all reported activities was multiplied by the minutes of Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and then divided by 7 to obtain the mean daily time children engaged in Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Children who participated in Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at least 60 min per day were considered as meeting the recommendations for PA. Daily time spent in sedentary activities (e.g. television viewing, use of Internet for non-study reasons, playing with computer or/and console games) was also calculated for each student (via multiplying the weekly frequency of participation with the duration per bout of participation in sedentary activities and then dividing by 7).",f90fd9f9-ff32-460e-a7e8-81c08af594de
9,methods6," Using the threshold of two hours per day, as per current guidelines, students were classified as sedentary or not, i.e., exceeding (>2 h/d) or not (≤2 h/d) the recommended daily time spent in sedentary activities30. Moreover, sleep time was assessed through self-reported recordings. We classified as meeting the recommendations of sufficient sleep those children (aged 6-12 yr old) who were sleeping at least nine hours per day and those adolescents (aged 13-17-yr-old) who were sleeping at least eight hours per day. Children and adolescents that were sleeping less than the recommended hours were classified as having insufficient sleep31.    Ethical approval   Ethical approval for the health survey was granted by the Ethical Review Board of the Ministry of Education and the Ethical Review Committee of Harokopio University (decision No 37/20-02-2013).

In order to assess the potential effect of several dietary habits on the ‘adequate vs. inadequate’ PA level, binary logistic regression analysis was implemented and OR with the corresponding 95% CI were calculated, adjusted for confounders. Furthermore, aiming to assess the potential effect of several demographic and lifestyle factors on the PA level, hierarchical binary logistic regression analysis was implemented and OR with the corresponding 95% CI were calculated to obtain adjusted association of covariates while controlling for confounding.",44ac0155-e30e-44dd-bf95-d6fc03c1f759

23,discussion2," Although the role of PA in the prevention of obesity is less obvious, there are enough scientific evidence to support the notion that lower PA levels are associated with a higher prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents13-15. Furthermore, in order to use PA as a tool to promote effective prevention strategies against obesity, a clearer understanding of the behavioral, psycho-social, and environmental factors that influence PA is needed, including the interactions between PA and other lifestyle factors such as sedentary time, sleeping and dietary habits36.    Participants of this study with increased screen time consumption (>2 h/d) had lower odds of adequate PA levels by almost 20%, in both sexes. A study in nationally representative sample of 15,143 US youth revealed that participants who engaged in less PA watched more TV per week37.

26,discussion5," These findings reveal the usefulness of these risk factor guidelines with respect to PA levels in addition to quantify the effect of failing to meet multiple cut points concurrently.    This study was performed in a wide age range and examined several covariates. In Greece, secondary and primary education is required and, consequently, we had the opportunity to study a huge part of the population aged 8- to 17-yr-old.    Limitations include methodological issues and the fact that prospective confounding factors, such as socio-economic status etc., that were likely connected to PA status, have not been evaluated. The record of PA was self-reported led to an overestimation of PA, and therefore the absolute PA levels should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, the record of dietary habits, sleeping time, and sedentary time was self-reported, therefore subject to desirable reporting bias. Nevertheless, participant responses were anonymous; as a result, they had no reason to misreport.",766e7009-21cc-4f9a-842c-9d6c16883332
