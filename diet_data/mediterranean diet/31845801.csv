0,methods0," Study participants  The Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC) is a prospective cohort established to investigate lifestyle and genetic factors and chronic diseases. In 1993–1996, the cohort enrolled more than 215 000 men and women aged 45–75 years, who were primarily of five race/ethnicities: African American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, Latino and White(11). At cohort entry, participants completed a self-administered comprehensive questionnaire that included a quantitative FFQ (questionnaire that included a quantitative FFQ (QFFQ)). In a 10-year follow-up survey (2003–2008), 98 214 participants (45 %) repeated the questionnaire. Participants who completed the follow-up survey tended, at cohort entry, to be younger (58·3 v. 60·3 years), Japanese American (31 v. 23 %), Whites (27 v. 19 %), never smokers (48 v. 45 %), more educated (graduated college 34 v. 21 %), less obese (17 v. 21 %) and to have higher diet quality (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 67·6 v.",6b5a49c2-4406-4fb4-9771-85fb59345fea
1,methods1," 66·4) compared with non-respondents; the proportion of female was similar (56 v. 57 %). The institutional review boards at the University of Hawaii and the University of Southern California approved the study. For the present study, we excluded participants who did not self-report as one of the five racial/ethnic groups (n 5246), who reported implausible diets based on total energy intake or its components at either survey (n 5930), who had a history of cancer or heart disease at either survey (n 23 783) or who had missing or invalid (<15 or >50 kg/m2) BMI at either survey (n 3137). Since health implications of body weight and weight change are different for individuals who are elderly or underweight, we restricted the analysis to participants younger than 70 years with normal or elevated BMI (≥18·5 kg/m2) at baseline. The final sample included 53 977 participants (23 521 men and 30 456 women).",c0732d4d-7962-416f-b375-c3a43ae43eea
2,methods2,"  Dietary assessment and calculation of dietary indexes  At baseline and 10-year follow-up surveys, dietary data were collected using a questionnaire that included a quantitative FFQ (QFFQ), which can be accessed at https://www.uhcancercenter.org/mec. The baseline questionnaire that included a quantitative FFQ (QFFQ) with > 180 food items was developed based on 3-d measured food records(11). For each ethnic group, the contribution of each food item to the total intake of major nutrients of interest (e.g., fat, dietary fibre, vitamin A, carotenoids and vitamin C) was calculated. A minimum set of food items that accounted for at least 85 % of the nutrients was identified for each ethnic group and included in the questionnaire that included a quantitative FFQ (QFFQ). Therefore, the final questionnaire list accounted for much more than 85 % of the intake of the major nutrients(11).",cb602366-99cc-4065-827a-ed5d1bcae792
3,methods3," A calibration study showed satisfactory correlations (0·55–0·74) between the questionnaire that included a quantitative FFQ (QFFQ) and three 24-h dietary recalls, for each racial/ethnic group, especially after energy adjustment(12). For the 10-year follow-up survey, the questionnaire that included a quantitative FFQ (QFFQ) was updated with modest changes in the design, food lists and examples given for each food item. Daily nutrient and food group intakes were calculated using the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC) food composition tables(13,14).  Diet quality was assessed by four diet quality indexes (DQI) (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015, AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores), which were calculated for the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC) as part of the Dietary Patterns Methods Project(5).",67da205b-65e2-44d0-aa2a-124a3228bcb5
4,methods4," In brief, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 is a measure of diet quality to assess conformance of dietary intake with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015–2020(15). The maximum Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 score is 100 points and higher scores indicate closer adherence with the dietary guidelines(15). There are nine adequacy components including total fruits, whole fruits, total vegetables, greens and beans, whole grains, dairy products, total protein foods, seafood and plant proteins, and fatty acids; and four moderation components including refined grains, Na, added sugars and saturated fat(15). The AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 is based on foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk(2,16–18). The maximum AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 score is 110 points and comprised of eleven components which are scored 0 (worst) to 10 (best)(2,16–18)).",5a793a51-985d-45cc-912d-7834a08ffaec
5,methods5," The components are vegetables, fruit, whole grains, sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, nuts and legumes, red/processed meat, trans-fat, long-chain (n-3) fats (EPA + DHA), PUFA, Na and alcohol(2,16–18). The aMED is a modification index from the Mediterranean diet scale of Trichopoulou et al.(4,19). The possible scores on aMED range from 0 to 9, with nine components scored 0 (worst) or 1 (best): vegetables, legumes, fruit, nuts, whole grains, red and processed meats, fish, ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat and ethanol(4). The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score is based on food and nutrients for hypertension management(3,20). The overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score ranges from 8 to 40 including eight components, scored 1 (worst) to 5 (best): fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, Na, red and processed meats, and sweetened beverages(3,20).",7682b5ba-44fc-49b8-a6aa-66d5f5c0fd92
6,methods6,  Body weight assessment  BMI (as weight in kg divided by height in m2) at baseline was computed from self-reported weight and height from the baseline questionnaire. BMI at the 10-year follow-up was calculated from weight reported on the 10-year follow-up questionnaire and height from the baseline questionnaire. Weight change between the two surveys was calculated by subtracting weight at baseline from weight at 10-year follow-up. ,865e8fba-6579-434a-aa66-0c65eaa113d7
7,analysis0," Selected characteristics of study participants are presented as mean values and standard deviations for quantitative variables and percentages for categorical variables for men and women separately. Change of diet quality over 10 years was analysed with two approaches. In the first approach, diet quality indexes (DQI) change between two surveys was calculated by subtracting diet quality score at baseline from diet quality score at 10-year follow-up. Since the scales for the indexes are varied, diet quality indexes (DQI) changes were examined based on 1 sd of change in each index over 10 years (online Supplementary Table S1). In this approach, diet quality indexes (DQI) changes were treated either continuously, per 1 sd increment, or categorically: greatest decline (≥ 1 sd decrease), moderate decline (0·5– < 1 sd decrease), stable (< 0·5 sd change), moderate increase (0·5– < 1 sd increase) and greatest increase (≥ 1 sd increase), with the stable group as a reference.",05c9f2be-abf5-400a-847d-0ad80cf7a458
8,analysis1," In the second approach, diet quality indexes (DQI) changes were categorised into four trajectories based on the median scores of each index at baseline as follows: (1) consistently low, below the median value at both surveys (reference), (2) high to low, from above to below the median, (3) low to high, from below to above the median and (4) consistently high, above the median value at both surveys.  Using multivariable linear regression, body weight changes (means and 95 % CI) were regressed on diet quality indexes (DQI) changes (per 1 sd increment, by change categories or trajectories) in men and women separately.",b51168fa-49aa-4fe1-8750-79319373a6bc
9,analysis2," The following covariates were included in the models: race/ethnicity (African American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, Latino, White); at baseline, age (years), BMI (18·5 to <25, 25 to <30, 30 to <35, ≥35 kg/m2), education (≤high school, vocational school/some college, ≥college graduate), marital status (married, separated/divorced, widowed, never married), smoking status (never, former, current), multivitamin use (yes/no), diet quality score and, for women only, menopausal hormone therapy use (yes/no); at baseline and change between the two surveys, physical activity (hours spent in moderate or vigorous activity per d) and energy intake (kcal/d).

10,analysis3," Unlike in the first approach with adjustment for baseline diet quality scores, for trajectories of diet quality indexes (DQI) changes in the second approach, baseline diet quality scores were not adjusted for since they were already built into the trajectory definition. We also conducted subgroup analyses by race/ethnicity, baseline age and BMI. Data were analysed using SAS software (version 9.4, SAS Institute, Inc.) and statistical significance was considered at P < 0·05. ",a054c705-4c16-43bd-baa3-81eee14f9b5c

Over 10 years, mean body weight increased by 1·2 (sd 6·8) kg for men (80·3 kg at baseline to 81·5 kg at 10-year follow-up) and 1·5 (sd 7·2) kg for women (66·7–68·2 kg) (online Supplementary Table S1). In general, diet quality indexes (DQI) slightly improved over 10 years both in men (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 score: 65·2–68·8 points) and women (69·0–72·3 points) and across the racial/ethnic groups (online Supplementary Table S1).",ce7ed145-808a-43e5-b19c-d433dccecb9e

22,discussion0," The present study examined the associations between changes in diet quality assessed by four predefined diet quality indexes (DQI) and changes in body weight over 10 years in a large multiethnic population. Maintaining a high-quality diet and improvement in diet quality were associated with less weight gain both in men and women. Smaller weight gain with improvement in diet quality was found in most subgroups by race/ethnicity, baseline age and baseline BMI. The inverse association was stronger in younger age and higher BMI groups, compared with older and lower BMI groups, respectively.  Several recent studies have shown an inverse association between diet quality at baseline and subsequent weight change(6–9).",c38d8d2d-bfde-48d9-afff-c175d42b9750
23,discussion1," The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Physical Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol Consumption, Cessation of Smoking, Eating Out of Home, and Obesity project reported that individuals with high adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern showed 0·16 kg less weight gain during the 5-year follow-up, compared with those with low adherence(6). Data from the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (University of Navarra Follow-Up) study also showed that high adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was associated with 0·059 kg/year smaller weight gain during the mean follow-up of 5·7 years(7).",1d38770e-348d-4df6-8029-fcf1437a83b3

Additionally, a prospective study in Australia showed that men who had high adherence to the Australian dietary guideline gained less BMI compared with men who had low adherence (0·05 v. 0·11 kg/m2 per year, P = 0·01) during 15-year follow-up(9).

The association was stronger in the younger cohort (Nurses’ Health Study II) than the older cohort (Nurses’ Health Study I and Health Professionals Follow-up Study), and among overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) than normal-weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2) individuals(10), which was consistent with our results.",b4f85b9e-95f1-4be3-bd41-faa956e6860a
26,discussion4," In the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study, a 10 % increase in the four diet quality indexes (DQI) was associated with smaller increase in waist circumference over 3 years by 0·43 cm for AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, 0·40 cm for Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, 0·28 cm for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and 0·07 cm for a MED(21). In the present study, relatively weaker associations were observed with aMED, compared with the other diet quality indexes (DQI), which was also found in the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study(10) and the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study(21). These may be partly because the different scoring system across the diet quality indexes (DQI). For instance, Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 (0–100 points), AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 (0–110) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) (8–40) have wider ranges of total scores compared with aMED (0–9).",5bd3144b-1e11-4030-bbc9-74b718277e70
27,discussion5," Nevertheless, as all of these diet quality indexes (DQI) emphasise healthful diet, the direction of association between improving diet quality and less weight gain was consistent across all the analysed indexes.  In the current study, smaller weight gain with improvement in diet quality was found across racial/ethnic groups in general, but it was less apparent in African Americans especially for Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015. The explanation for this inconsistency is not clear. However, African American men and women had the highest Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 scores at baseline and showed the smallest increase over 10 years, while their mean scores for the other indexes at baseline were similar to or less than the overall means (online Supplementary Table S1).",04ad9521-95de-4c55-b0a2-4458ec28b28f
28,discussion6," Unlike Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015, improvement in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) (men) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 (women) was significantly associated with less weight gain in African Americans. The racial/ethnic differences in the associations might be influenced by differences in components and scoring systems in each of the diet quality indexes (DQI), but this warrants further investigation.  The association between improving diet quality and less weight gain was stronger in the younger age groups (45–59 v. 60–69 years at baseline) in the present study. This may be partially due to weight change patterns over 10 years varied by age group. Among individuals aged 45–49 years at cohort entry, mean body weight increased by 2·8 (sd 7·1) kg for men and 3·6 (sd 7·7) kg for women, whereas it decreased by 0·4 (sd 6·1) kg for men and 0·3 (sd 6·4) kg for women aged 60–69 years at cohort entry.",0165663e-20c1-47ed-86d1-14005120f978
29,discussion7," In addition, the oldest age group had higher diet quality indexes (DQI) scores at baseline(22) and showed smaller increases in the diet quality indexes (DQI) over 10 years in general(23), compared with the younger age groups.  In previous studies in the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC), higher BMI at cohort entry was associated with higher risk of mortality(24), pancreatic cancer for men(25), breast cancer incidence for women(26) and breast cancer-specific mortality among women diagnosed with incident breast cancer(27). In studies examining weight both at age 21 years and cohort entry, adult obesity and increase in adiposity during adulthood were related to higher risk for prostate carcinogenesis in men(28), breast cancer in women(26), endometrial cancer in women(29) and diabetes both in men and women(30). Thus, maintaining a healthy weight throughout adulthood is important for preventing premature death and chronic disease.",1615a3ad-ec5d-4996-ba4a-caece7308f4f
30,discussion8," In the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC), the highest BMI group (≥35 kg/m2) showed lower diet quality indexes (DQI) scores at baseline and smaller increases in the diet quality indexes (DQI) scores over 10 years, compared with the lower BMI groups(22,23). Nonetheless, in the current study, improving diet quality seemed to benefit the highest BMI group more than the lower BMI groups. If confirmed, this would strengthen the incentive for individuals who need weight control to adopt a healthy dietary pattern.  The present study has several strengths including a prospective design, a large number of participants in a population-based multiethnic cohort, repeated dietary assessment over 10 years by a validated questionnaire that included a quantitative FFQ (QFFQ) and comprehensive information on a wide range of potential covariates. However, there are several limitations that need to be considered.",70ead635-0928-4d24-9049-4134b0f05983
31,discussion9," First, body weight assessments for both surveys were based on self-report and thus misclassification of weight change may have occurred, although a high correlation between self-reported and measured weight was observed in both White (r 0·98) and Japanese Americans (r 0·99) in a study of sixty female Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC) participants(31) as well as in other study populations(32–34). In addition, systematic errors according to sex, ethnicity and obesity status have been reported(35), despite strong correlations between self-reported and measured weight. Second, dietary data based on a self-administered questionnaire that included a quantitative FFQ (QFFQ) are subject to non-differential measurement error, which commonly occurs in a cohort study resulting in attenuated risk estimates(36).",a35d27ee-26a6-4639-9416-3cf06cba4cbf
32,discussion10," Third, although participants who had previous cancer or heart disease at either survey were excluded from the current analysis, we could not completely rule out any changes in diet quality or body weight due to underlying illness. Finally, the current findings are based on the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC) participants who completed the 10-year follow-up survey (45 % of total) and were somewhat different from non-respondents as described in the ‘Methods’ section, with further restriction to those (approximately 54 000) with normal or higher BMI and without cancer or heart disease. Thus, a selection bias that would limit generalisability cannot be excluded.  Conclusions  In a multiethnic population, 10-year improvement in diet quality was associated with a smaller weight gain overall, which varied by race/ethnicity, age and BMI at baseline. Our findings suggest maintaining a high-quality diet and improving diet quality over time may be helpful in preventing excessive weight gain.",5e115b96-eaf2-4199-965d-498bae25ff07
