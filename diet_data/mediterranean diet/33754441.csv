0,methods0," A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) guidelines and registered in the Prospero database (CRD42020189337). Literature was searched in PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases for studies published from 2010 up to and including 2021. The following inclusion criteria were used: age 18 years and older, sample size > 1000 participants, and using a validated MD adherence score. Studies that only included participants with nutrition-related or other severe chronic disorders, as well as studies that only included specific subpopulations (e.g., pregnant women), were excluded in order to focus on the general adult population. A quality analysis of the included studies was done using the National Collaborating Center for Methods and Tools (NCCMT) scale. ",172bdd14-fe9a-4522-8a6b-d723fe227d0e
1,results0," Study selection  The search of the 3 databases yielded a total of 2734 studies (Fig. 1). After removing duplicates (n = 584), 2150 unique articles remained. Subsequent to the screening of articles’ titles and abstracts, 1962 were excluded. The number of retained articles for full text screening was 195. Among these 195 articles, 83 articles were related to the same cohorts and were distributed as follows: ATTICA (18 studies), et al (2010) [30] PC (EPIC) (15), MOLI-SANI (9), SUN (17), Three-city population (3), HELIAD (4), SU.VI.MAX (3), MEAL (7), MEDIS (4), Seniors-et al (2012) [18] CS (ENRICA) (3). In total, we included 14 of these articles, as explained in the methodology section. Other reasons to exclude articles were the lack of MD adherence data, being focused on specific populations (e.g.",b3ac6d28-89a8-45f9-98fa-a89492ca4d65

The final number of included studies was n = 50. The result of the selection procedure is summarized in Fig. 1 [35].  Characteristics of included studies  Included studies conducted in Spain (n = 17) formed the largest group, followed by nine in France, nine in Italy, six from Greece, two from Lebanon, one each from Israel, Croatia, Malta, Cyprus and three papers reporting data from various Mediterranean countries (Table 2). In total, 27 studies had a cross-sectional design, and 23 papers were derived from prospective cohorts. The age of the included populations ranged between 18 and 95, with 10 studies including older populations aged > 60 years only. The vast majority of the studies were performed on a community-based sample and presented data on both males and females.",364fe3f3-3d39-4c49-b58d-9824517b3b4f
3,results2," Three studies [36–38] included females only. The number of participants in the included studies ranged between 1013 and 94,113. Twenty three papers reported results of MD adherence by sex group and eight studies reported results of adherence by age group. Results on MD adherence (as mean, median and/or distribution of categories) from the included papers are shown in Table 3. The mean MD adherence score for the total population was reported in 35 papers, 5 papers reported the median MD adherence score, and the remaining papers reported the distribution of MD adherence by categories. The Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS) by Trichoupoulo et al. (0–9 or 0–8) was used in 15 papers [16, 32, 36, 38–49], whereas the rMed score (0–17 or 0–18) was used in nine papers [30, 32, 50–56] and the MedDietScore by Panagiotakos et al. score (0–55) were used in ten papers [8, 20, 26, 32, 57–62].",7dbf68f6-d299-4b84-817a-312bbf69c629

The last parameter of the quality analysis, related to withdrawals and drop-out rates, was applicable to 32 out of the 50 studies, 14 of which had a weak score, where drop-outs and withdrawals were either not reported or the percentage of participants who completed the study was higher than 60%. Twelve had a high score, with 80–100% of enrolled participants completing the study, and six had a moderate score, with 60–80% of participants completing the study. In total, 16 out of the 50 included studies had an overall weak quality score and 17 had a moderate score.

7,results18,"  MD adherence  Of the 36 studies that reported mean or median MD adherence scores, 26 reported moderate adherence to MD, eight reported low adherence, one study [32] reported moderate adherence as per the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS), rMed, Italian Mediterranean Index (IMI) and Lebanese Mediterranean Index (LMD) scores, and low adherence as per the MedDietScore, and one study [30] reported high adherence. The latter study was a multinational study including four European Mediterranean countries (France, Greece, Italy, and Spain), reporting high adherence among the Greek, Italian and Spanish populations and moderate adherence among French females. Studies that reported the distribution of the sample according to categories (e.g., low, moderate and high) also found low (n = 7) or moderate (n = 20) MD adherence as the most prevalent categories, and three studies found high adherence.",78c36c08-e161-4524-9ad1-829d3f7ce8f3
8,results19,"  MD adherence in subgroups  Sex groups  Twenty-one studies reported mean MD adherence for men and women separately [8, 16, 20, 24, 39, 41, 42, 44–46, 51, 55, 56, 59, 61, 62, 64, 69, 72–74, 76, 77]. Nine of these papers reported moderate adherence for both sex [16, 39, 41, 42, 44, 69, 72, 76, 77], while one paper reported high adherence [56] and three reported low adherence for both sex [61, 62, 73]. One paper reported high adherence in women and moderate adherence in men [51], while another reported low adherence in women and moderate adherence in men [59] and in contrast one reported low adherence in men and moderate adherence in women [74]. Out of the three studies that included only females, two [46, 64] reported high adherence and one [55] reported low adherence to the MD.",02e9786e-89eb-4418-a873-9106d897db91
9,results20," Finally, one [20] study reported moderate adherence for men over the years (between 1985–1989 and 2005–2006), in contrast to a decrease in adherence for women from moderate during 1985–1989 to low during 2005–2006. More details about mean MD adherence and/or distribution per sex subgroups are provided in supporting information 2 (S2).  Age  Eight papers reported mean MD adherence scores per age group [20, 38, 56, 60, 62, 69, 73, 74]. The MD adherence scores were low for all age categories in two papers [62, 73] and moderate in three papers [20, 60, 69], while one paper that included females aged between 45–68 years only reported lower scores among the youngest women [38] and one paper reported low adherence among the age groups 18 to 44 and moderate for the participants aged more than 45 [74]. One study reported high adherence across age groups (18 + years old) [56].",fd950443-e008-4dac-917f-f787c4cb8421
10,results21," Out of the nine studies that included a sample composed of the elderly aged 65 years and above, six reported moderate MD adherence [16, 39, 48, 57–59], two studies [8, 60] reported a low adherence level, and one study [71] found that the majority of the population (41.7%) were classified in the highest category of adherence. More details about mean MD adherence and/or distribution per age subgroups are provided in supporting information 3 (S3). ",efa5bfcc-1487-4fe5-9a21-ef5c067bc079
11,discussion0," This systematic review provided an overview of MD adherence among the general adult population living in a Mediterranean country that traditionally follow a Mediterranean diet. The search strategy identified 50 articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, mostly reporting moderate MD adherence.  The majority of studies reported low to moderate MD adherence (35 studies). This seems to indicate that Mediterranean populations seem to be shifting away from the MD. Moreover, moderate adherence was also found to be the most prevalent adherence category in studies that provided data on distribution of the population across categories of MD adherence. This indicates that the moderate MD adherence score results from most people being in the moderate category rather than from one part of the population scoring very high and the other part of the population scoring very low.",ef39d915-074e-4482-b74e-cc5e17ec6d36
12,discussion1," The only study reporting high MD adherence was a multinational prospective cohort (the et al (2010) [30] PC (EPIC) cohort) by Buckland et al. conducted in nine European countries (four of them being Mediterranean countries: France, Spain, Italy, and Greece) [30]. This study reports on data collected between 1992 till 2000, which is less recent than most of the other papers included in this review. However, it is unclear whether this reflects an actual decrease in adherence, as Kyriacou et al. [78] highlighted the impact of the scoring system on the measured level of adherence: adherence as evaluated by the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDS) of Trichopoulou et al. [12], the first scoring system available, seems to obtain higher values of MD adherence.  On another note, MD adherence scores are potentially being diluted in national studies due to the variability of the typical diet within each of the Mediterranean countries (e.g., northern vs southern regions).",0821e196-836c-4bab-a1aa-10ae96ea29af
13,discussion2," For instance, the population of southern Italy showed better MD adherence than inhabitants of northern Italian regions [17]. To understand the reasons underlying the levels of MD adherence, potential determinants of adherence such as age, place of residency, sex, and socio-economic and educational status should be further examined, calling for an investigation on the determinants of MD adherence across Mediterranean countries.  Concerning MD adherence in subgroups, in general, few sex differences were found in the 23 papers reporting on MD adherence for men and women separately. Most of the papers reported moderate to low adherence in both sexes. This finding is shared by the systematic review by Kyriacou et al. on MD adherence in Greek and Cypriot populations, reporting no difference between sex groups [78]. As an exception, in their paper published from the ATTICA cohort, Arvaniti et al.",02dc81ff-800d-48da-8fc0-59a8089fbd1e
14,discussion3," found that there were higher scores among women compared to men, mainly due to higher intakes of fruits and dairy products and lower intakes of red meat among women [23]. It is important to identify such potential sex differences in MD adherence to develop and implement sex-sensitive interventions to promote MD among both men and women. Such a tailoring of nutritional interventions by sex is reported to result in better adherence to a dietary pattern [79].  This systematic review also sheds some light on MD adherence in different age groups. Based on studies in this review, there does not seem to be a difference according to age: MD adherence is moderate in all age groups. This contrasts with previous hypotheses, as it is expected that older generations stick to the more traditional diets, whereas younger generations turn to more Western diets [80]. One study by Garcıa-Arenzana et al.",915ff0ed-4183-4bb9-af59-de86c6e1a81b
15,discussion4," [38] reported significantly lower scores among the youngest women, which joins the work of Veronese et al. [20], that reported a stronger decrease in adherence to MD among the younger population compared to the older population, due to special dietary modifications related to age, as a consequence of the increase in nutrition-related disorders (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, diabetes). In contrast, according to Foscolou et al. [60], there was a decrease in MD adherence among the older population over the years (between 2005 and 2017) and this was attributed to various social determinants: the place of residency, level of education, and lifestyle factors [60]. This systematic review cannot draw definite conclusions on the level of adherence among different age groups. More insight is needed in MD adherence scores across ages and determinants for shifting away from the MD.  The vast majority of studies in this systematic review pertained to France, Spain, Greece, and Italy.",9a3a2de4-2718-4276-9522-849f95239287
16,discussion5," We found a gap in this area of research among the African Mediterranean countries (Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco) as well as the Middle Eastern Mediterranean countries (Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Palestinian territory). This could be due to one of the inclusion criteria (> 1000 participants), but there were also few studies from non-European countries in the excluded studies with small sample sizes.  The quality assessment showed weak to moderate scores on selection bias, validity and reliability of measurement instruments, and withdrawal and drop-out criteria from the National Collaborating Center for Methods and Tools (NCCMT) scale [28] for assessment of quantitative studies for most of the included studies.",23672fd1-940d-4875-9004-796cc9b930e3
17,discussion6," This indicates the need for more high-quality studies among Mediterranean countries, especially in terms of representativeness of the general population, the use of validated and reliable measurement tools, and the MD adherence score, to get a more accurate picture of the adherence to MD among Mediterranean populations.  This systematic review has several strengths: it followed the PRISMA guidelines and was registered in the Prospero database (CRD42020189337). Multiple databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO, to collect a broad range of articles from different research fields. In addition, the screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by independent researchers, and the tool used to assess the quality of the included studies was a validated instrument [28]. Nevertheless, there are some limitations to our systematic literature review. First of all, the search was restricted to studies published in the English language.",8f6b393a-8930-4b96-a4a7-da990a0c9f6a
18,discussion7," Moreover, studies including less than 1000 participants were excluded, which in practice prevented us from capturing the MD adherence status from various smaller studies from several North African and Middle Eastern Mediterranean countries. Further, a variety of scores was used to evaluate Mediterranean diet adherence and the categorization was also variable, and there was no clear definition of cut-off points to classify adherence to MD: some studies used tertiles, others used quartiles, and some set their own cut-offs to classify the adherence as low, moderate or high. The variability of the indexes in terms of range, and food items included in the calculation of the score have made it hard to trace and/or to compare the adherence level between countries or within the same country. This is well described in a systematic review by Zaragoza-Marti et al., who found 28 different MD adherence scores that had variable psychometric properties [81].",24ff66c0-f9b8-43f1-936f-a692d213958c
19,discussion8," This led us to create a system of classification where MD adherence scores were categorized as low, medium or high. However, this system of classification might have affected the interpretation of means, since various studies reported mean MD scores at the borderline of the different categories, which might have led us to label a study as reporting low, moderate or high MD adherence with only a decimal value difference in the mean score.  Conclusion  This is the first paper that systematically reviewed the scientific literature available on MD adherence among adults living in Mediterranean countries specifically. Mediterranean populations have been showing low to moderate adherence to MD in the past 10 years. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve adherence to MD by younger and older adults, and for men and women, even in the countries of its origin. This requires appropriate health promotion and nutritional policies and interventions.",81cd9636-2245-4def-a838-4bf64a7c8943
20,discussion9," Health promotion efforts to improve adherence to MD can have large effects on a broad range of health outcomes of inhabitants [2, 6, 7]  The large variety of indexes used to measure MD adherence, in addition to variability in the classification systems, does not enable us to compare and trace MD adherence between and within countries, as well as across time. We therefore recommend establishing a common system of classification for the MD adherence indexes. We also advocate the implementation of large-scale studies of MD adherence in African Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Mediterranean countries, as they were underrepresented in the current review. In addition, to be able to improve MD adherence, it is important to study determinants of adherence to the MD in these countries to help in designing appropriate local and national policies and interventions to promote adherence to the MD.",e8542245-e26f-4d9b-9a76-3512af0017a4
21,discussion10," Therefore, we recommend a systematic review of the literature on determinants of adherence to the MD in Mediterranean countries. This would enable health promoters to intervene and improve the adherence level to this healthy dietary pattern, based on identified determinants.
