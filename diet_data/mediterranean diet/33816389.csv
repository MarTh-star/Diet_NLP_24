0,background0," Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) is predominantly managed by lifestyle intervention, in the absence of effective pharmacotherapies. Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is the recommended diet, albeit with limited evidence.  Aims  To compare an ad libitum MedDiet to low‐fat diet (low‐fat diet (LFD)) in patients with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) for reducing intrahepatic lipids (intrahepatic lipids (IHL)) by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H‐MRS). Secondary outcomes include insulin resistance by homeostatic model of assessment (HOMA‐IR), visceral fat by bioelectrical impedance analysis (bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)), liver stiffness measurement (liver stiffness measurement (LSM)) and other metabolic outcomes.

As a result of the nature of the study which prescribed a diet to both groups the participants and dietitians administering the diets could not be blinded. However, all analysis was conducted by a statistician who was blinded to the study conditions. Human research ethics committee approval was obtained from all hospital sites. Approval was also obtained from La Trobe University human research ethics committee.  FIGURE 1 MEDINA study inclusion and exclusion criteria  2.2 Diet intervention  The low‐fat diet (LFD) was based on dietary recommendations as set out by the Australian Dietary Guidelines and The Heart Foundation, advising dietary patterns that equated to approximately 30% of total energy from fat, 50% from carbohydrate and 20% from protein.",1451e1b7-ce2a-44e6-a7fd-6b28cc264f0f

These models included terms to estimate group effects at the mid‐ (where available) and post‐intervention time points and were adjusted for pre‐intervention diabetes status and baseline visceral fat level by including their interactions with time point. Specification of an unstructured residual error variance–covariance matrix ensured that models implicitly adjusted for the baseline level of the outcome. 32 All participants with post‐baseline outcome data contributed to the estimation of intervention effects. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted in which observations that had disproportionate effects on model estimates (as determined by inspection of DFBETA values) were checked for and, where present, the model was refitted with the influential observation(s) omitted.",606c4d38-dd68-4e16-8acc-63005fec50f8

25,results22,"  1 INTRODUCTION  Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide, affecting approximately 20%–30% of the adult population. 1 Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) results from an accumulation of fat in the liver which exceeds 5% of total liver weight and occurs in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. 2 Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is often referred to as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome as it tends to occur with one or more risk factors that define the syndrome including insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity and/or hyperlipidaemia. 3 , 4 A variety of therapeutic interventions have been proposed for the management of Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); these have predominantly focused on weight reduction using low‐calorie diets, exercise, pharmacotherapy or bariatric surgery, as well as lipid‐lowering drugs and antioxidant supplementation.",d0a3b6be-2ab0-422d-9e48-cc28c14689d6
26,results23," 5 In the absence of effective and safe pharmacotherapy, diet and lifestyle interventions remain the first‐line treatment in Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The most effective treatment to date is weight loss and there seems to be a direct relationship between percentage weight loss and improvement in risk factors. 6 , 7 , 8 In real‐world settings, weight loss continues to be difficult to achieve and even harder to maintain, with long term follow‐up studies confirming that weight loss is generally not sustained. 9 , 10  A large body of literature surrounds the benefits of a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) in conditions such as metabolic syndrome, T2DM and cardiovascular disease; such conditions often co‐exist and have a pathophysiological link with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",11bbdd81-996e-4d6c-984b-98a57d3ac5c4

In addition, prescribed dietary interventions within the studies are variable and thus there is lack of consistent high‐quality evidence to support a superior dietary pattern for this patient group.  Mediterranean diet interventions are also largely limited to Mediterranean regions and thus the feasibility and efficacy of achieving dietary adherence in patients with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from Western, multiethnic populations have not been determined.",3a5d062e-61fc-4758-9d1e-5ddd96a63164

Benefits that have been reported following the provision of low‐fat diet (LFD) are elicited because of the effects of weight loss and not necessarily the effects of the diet itself. 23 , 24  Therefore, the aims of this RCT were to compare an ad libitum MedDiet to a low‐fat diet (LFD) in patients with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by comparing the efficacy of the two dietary patterns in relation to several metabolic parameters including primary outcome intrahepatic lipids (IHL), and secondary outcomes, including insulin resistance as determined by homeostatic model of assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR).

Furthermore, the study aimed to assess the relationship between changes in the above metabolic factors and body composition across the two dietary patterns.

31,discussion1," Indeed, we found the low‐fat diet (LFD) significantly reduced hepatic steatosis and HOMA‐IR in Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) subjects following the 12‐week intervention, in contrast to MedDiet that led to non‐significant albeit clinically relevant, reductions in both metabolic parameters. These changes however were not significant when compared between‐groups. However, an important finding from the study was that both dietary interventions resulted in significant reductions in visceral fat, with the reduction being more pronounced in the low‐fat diet (LFD) group.  These findings align with evidence that weight loss elicits improvements in hepatic steatosis with the low‐fat diet (LFD) group achieving almost 4% weight loss, in 12 weeks despite the intervention having an emphasis on weight maintenance.",7d37eec7-a30f-4994-ae64-4f763eb5a66f
32,discussion2," In contrast, although there were potentially, clinically meaningful improvements in hepatic steatosis in the MedDiet group despite remaining essentially weight stable, these were not statistically significant. This reiterates that energy restriction and subsequently weight loss appear to play a central role in the management of Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, weight loss is difficult to achieve and hard to maintain and what this study indicates is that changes in dietary behaviours such as choosing foods that improve dietary quality may be sustainable and lead to small but meaningful effects in Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Still, current EASL–EASD–EASO Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease recommend the MedDiet as the optimal dietary pattern.",79f03415-19a1-4042-b86c-6b89e6558101
33,discussion3," 35 In comparison, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)) guidelines are more conservative recommending that additional rigorous, prospective studies such as ours and longer‐term data with histological endpoints are required before specific macronutrient compositions can be recommended. 36 Although the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) wording only acknowledges macronutrients, dietary patterns which represent the whole diet, are needed to make sustainable lifestyle changes. Other guidelines for Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) agree with those of American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and EASL, APASL clearly highlights the importance of a hypocaloric diet.",e8d4926e-cce4-4da8-9a80-1008596c1a30
34,discussion4," It is important to note that such guidelines are based on studies which are predominantly conducted in Mediterranean countries, and it seems the application of MedDiet in a multiethnic, diverse Western population such as in the present study is less straightforward. For example, to better understand the context and implications of adding energy‐dense foods to a multiethnic diet and how this can be balanced ad libitum or to achieve a caloric deficit. Furthermore, issues such as length of dietary intervention and additional participant support(s) to achieve higher levels of compliance are needed in multiethnic non‐Mediterranean populations to obtain the full translational benefits of a MedDiet.  There have been few studies showing significant beneficial effects with the provision of MedDiet in Western populations with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Ryan et al conducted a cross over RCT under tightly controlled conditions including the full provision of diet.",c367b68d-4d47-4468-abf6-67ee980602e0
35,discussion5," 14 This important proof of concept study showed that the MedDiet does indeed improve hepatic and metabolic outcomes in participants with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, under less stringent conditions, as shown in the present RCT in free‐living adults, it appears that more attention is warranted on how to apply and therefore translate the MedDiet into a population who does not habitually follow this dietary pattern. Furthermore, the addition of extra virgin olive oil high in mono‐unsaturated fatty acids, antioxidants, fat‐soluble vitamins and polyphenols is believed to be one of the key elements providing health benefits in the MedDiet, and yet is energy dense, and therefore adding it to a predominantly Western Diet can lead to higher overall energy intake, as seen in this study, albeit weight remained stable.",95c983f8-810f-402c-a7e7-148f34226439
36,discussion6," Furthermore, the results from this study are reinforced by another study conducted in Western Australia where ad libitum MedDiet and low‐fat diet (LFD) both improved hepatic steatosis indicating improvement in overall diet quality regardless of dietary prescription was beneficial. 15 The present study where the low‐fat diet (LFD) group achieved almost 4% weight reduction contrasts with the former study where no changes in weight were observed. While the reduction in total energy consumption did not reduce significantly within the low‐fat diet (LFD) the change is noteworthy and with adequate power for secondary outcomes such a reduction may have reached significance. Furthermore, a modest reduction in total fat intake in the low‐fat diet (LFD) group shows a further improvement in diet quality at the macronutrient level.  In the low‐fat diet (LFD) group, there were meaningful reductions in weight, waist circumference and body mass index (BMI).",c3928e8e-5ae7-4fc8-99a3-979de52d373b
37,discussion7," However, this study was not sufficiently powered for these secondary outcomes, and thus these changes were not statistically significant. Nonetheless robust evidence from a meta‐analysis of eight randomised controlled trials reported that 5% weight loss has been shown to improve hepatic outcomes. 37 This meta‐analysis is in agreement with the results from this study for the low‐fat diet group where weight loss resulted in a significant reduction in hepatic steatosis. The reduction in visceral fat observed in the low‐fat diet (LFD) group was also not surprising given the weight loss achieved. Of interest, however, the MedDiet group also saw a substantial and significant reduction in visceral fat after 12 weeks despite this group remaining largely weight stable. This supports the evidence that MedDiet can elicit favourable changes in body composition in the absence of weight loss.",5f4343e2-56b6-4683-8246-199860fbfeea
38,discussion8," 38 To explain this, another study comparing three ad libitum diets in overweight individuals for 6 months concluded that diet composition had no significant effect on preventing weight regain. The authors did, however, find that a diet rich in fat, especially MUFAs resulted in less body fat accumulation compared to the control diet. 39 This is in line with other studies showing components of a MedDiet including MUFA are inversely associated with abdominal adipose tissue accumulation regardless of body weight. 40 The mechanism for such benefits is largely unknown, however may be, at least in part, explained by the overall improvement in diet quality associated with increased MUFA intake, as many high MUFA foods and nutrient and antioxidant rich. In this small sample, the reduction in visceral fat after 12 weeks of MedDiet did not lead to statistically significant reductions in hepatic steatosis and HOMA‐IR although our observation of a clinically relevant 0.",d3b78ccf-1aba-4290-aa0f-cf379ae3918b
39,discussion9,"5 unit reduction in HOMA‐IR is not dissimilar to other studies in which a reduction of 0.8 units in HOMA‐IR with metformin and diet was demonstrated over 9 months. 41 While our study was powered to see a decrease in hepatic steatosis with the dietary patterns, the effect size in metabolic parameters between‐groups was not large enough to see a significant between‐group difference.  Mediterranean diet studies in Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are limited in non‐Mediterranean countries such as Australia and our results showing a lack of superiority of MedDiet over low‐fat diet (LFD) need to be carefully considered alongside other studies. For example, the lack of difference could be because the low‐fat diet (LFD) was more familiar as participants may have potentially received advice on this diet before and in addition may have perceived these foods to be more freely available.",6631beb3-fc0b-4572-a628-b8f2630253be
40,discussion10," The literature showing Mediterranean diet is beneficial, while demonstrated several times has not been shown to be superior in free living, Western or indeed Australian cohorts. 15 The changes in dietary adherence, as indicated by the MEDAS score were also marginal, and this too could explain the modest changes seen. However, it does appear that the MedDiet contributed to improving diet quality and in metabolic outcomes such as visceral fat reduction even in the absence of weight loss. Given the paucity of studies assessing the effects of a MedDiet alongside weight loss targets are lacking in Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) subjects, prospective studies are needed to determine if there are combined benefits with regard to improved diet quality and weight loss, beyond the low‐fat diet (LFD). Such studies are needed a priori to inform dietary recommendations and guidelines for Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the absence of effective pharmaco‐therapy.",ed637a1b-75cd-44c8-a6e9-a51b9cf4b771
41,discussion11,"  The main strengths of this study are its randomised controlled trial design which was carried out in free‐living adults with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Furthermore, the participants all had a matched number of face‐to‐face and phone appointments, controlling for any biases around contact with a healthcare professional. We also included robust collection of a 3‐day food diary to measure dietary compliance which was validated by an accredited practising dietitian who also provided telehealth support between face‐to‐face appointments. The MEDAS score was also used to measure compliance with MedDiet and low‐fat diet (LFD). Hepatic outcomes were also robust including the gold standard MRS approach for intrahepatic lipids (IHL) quantification, as well as Fibroscan for liver stiffness measure.",16e9e4db-4160-4bf6-a325-6b5e06df4f24
42,discussion12," Still, the limitations of this study include its small sample size which despite being powered on hepatic steatosis, with the unintended weight loss in the low‐fat diet (LFD) group the effect size was not sufficient to assess between‐group differences. The small sample size also limits generalizability of the secondary outcomes presented herein. Using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for assessing visceral fat has shown conflicting evidence with regard to validity and is less accurate in obese individuals and thus higher quality imaging such as CT or MRI should be used to verify these findings in future studies. 42 , 43 , 44 Furthermore, in dietary interventions it is not possible to blind clinicians and participants from dietary prescription.",1c325c18-da15-4010-95f1-3f8b25250857
43,discussion13," Despite being comparable in duration to similar studies 15 , 17 , 45 longer duration (or term) studies are needed to show efficacy, particularly in relation to outcomes such as liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and to determine the sustainability of dietary interventions and impact on dietary behaviours. The shorter duration may also explain why some parameters which showed clinically meaningful improvement were not statistically significant. Baseline diets in this study cohort were also not in line with the “poor” quality intake often seen in individuals with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), 46 and future studies may consider screening participants and recruiting those with poor diet quality at baseline. Finally, the baseline differences between study groups, despite randomisation may have had some impact on scope for changes with high glucose, visceral fat and heart rate in the low‐fat diet (LFD) group.",c46c8884-fd29-408b-b699-0c6f4ae2d254
44,discussion14," Diets overall were better than that of the general Australian population, also potentially hindering the scope to improve diet quality and thus outcomes in only 12 weeks.  5 ",efad4a71-08d4-482f-82a4-7a1fcc604888
45,conclusion0," In this RCT in Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) subjects, there were no significant differences in intrahepatic lipids (IHL) and metabolic parameters observed between‐groups for the MedDiet compared to low‐fat diet (LFD). However, in the low‐fat diet (LFD) arm there were significant reductions in intrahepatic lipids (IHL) and metabolic parameters whereas these improvements were not significant in the MedDiet group. Significant improvements in visceral fat were seen in both groups. This study highlights that the provision of dietary interventions in free‐living adults with Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is challenging (ACTRN12615001010583).
