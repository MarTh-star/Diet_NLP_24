0,methods0,"2.1. Data Description, Key Variables, Covariates and Measurement We use the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)) panel database. The survey design has been documented separately [21,22]. This is a rich and large database, which provides information not only on socio-demographics (e.g., gender, age, marital status, education level, ethnicity, household income) and physical health (e.g., body mass index (BMI), chronic illnesses), but also on behavioral health risks (e.g., dietary patterns, physical activity, smoking habits) and mental well-being (e.g., level of depressive symptoms, perceived quality of life). These data allow us to look at these multifaceted dimensions, following respondents at different points in time. In its latest form, Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) has data from the years 2004 to 2017 featured in 7 waves.",55074217-6636-474a-af0d-e4bf7b9c9158
1,methods1," Because of this, we can include controls for individual characteristics so as to “net out” the effects of individual factors on the outcome measures analyzed. With Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we can also exploit cross-national variation since it includes respondents from various European countries, enabling cross-country and cross-wave comparability. For this study, we make use of waves 4, 5, 6 and 7 (surveys taken from the years 2011 to 2017) which are the periods with data on dietary patterns. The number of observations ranges from 126,729 to 224,364 depending on the variables considered. The variable related to chronic illnesses has the largest number of observations, while those pertaining to diet have the smallest. The variable reflecting information on depressive symptoms is based on a sample of 167,698, while for body mass index (BMI) we have 218,151 observations.",34c0ba57-215c-4ba1-bc9f-5ef4a1fbc2c4
2,methods2," The 27 countries included in the sample are: Austria, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, France, Denmark, Greece, Switzerland, Belgium, Czech Republic, Poland, Luxembourg, Hungary, Portugal, Slovenia, Cyprus, Estonia, Croatia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Finland, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovakia. Taking the original sample from waves 4 to 7, respondents were aged 50 to 112 years old. However, in the analysis we put a restriction on the age up to 80, as will be explained in Section 2.2. The resulting mean age in our sample is 65. The most frequent age categories are 55−59, 60−64 and 65−69. From the sample, 56% are female. The succeeding subsections describe the groups of variables we use for the analysis.  2.1.1. Health Outcome Indicators We are interested in the indicators related to cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s, the level of body mass index (BMI) and mental well-being. Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) covers several types of diseases.",22b40ff0-bfdf-4095-a934-c6d03c1a1860
3,methods3," For this study, we generated a composite chronic illness variable that considers only those illnesses related to cardiovascular diseases and Type 2 diabetes—all belonging to cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s. Specifically, we included: heart attack and other heart problems, hypertension, high blood cholesterol, stroke or cerebral vascular disease and diabetes or high blood sugar. For this variable, a higher value indicates the individual suffers more cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s. A value of 5 means this respondent reported suffering from all the five types of cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s included in the survey. We use the variable for body mass index (BMI) provided by Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) which has been calculated from individual weight and height, and has continuous values. Values equal and greater than 25 indicate being overweight or obese (≥30).",ab3bead2-aa28-4ee3-85eb-eb2ab8f1d4d3
4,methods4,"  For mental well-being, we make use of the EURO-D scale included in the Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) questionnaire. This is a composite index which is a symptom scale measuring the level of depressive symptoms with values ranging from 0 (having no symptoms) to 12: “The scale includes 12 items that are summed and clinically significant depression is defined as a score greater than 3. This cut-point has been validated in the EURODEP study against a variety of clinically relevant indicators. Respondents scoring above this level would likely be diagnosed as suffering from a depressive disorder, for which therapeutic intervention would be indicated” [23] (p. 5). A tabulation of how many observations have been classified under the incidence of cardio metabolic disorders (CMD), body mass index (BMI) (in broad groupings) and the scales of EURO-D are in Table A1, Table A2 and Table A3.",744c7044-6259-4f33-90b3-91766a36e3b5
5,methods5," From our sample, about 56% are indicated to be suffering one cardio metabolic disorders (CMD) or more, 65% are classified as between being overweight and obese, while 26% have reported to be depressive symptomatic.  2.1.2. Mediterranean Diet Data on dietary patterns had been assessed through the following survey questions:In a regular week, how often do you have a serving of dairy products, such as a glass of milk, cheese in a sandwich, a cup of yogurt or a can of high protein supplement?”  In a regular week, how often do you have a serving of legumes, beans or eggs?”  In a regular week, how often do you eat meat, fish or poultry?”  In a regular week, how often do you consume a serving of fruits or vegetables?”    The potential answers were (1) Less than once a week; (2) Once a week; (3) Twice a week; (4) 3–6 times a week; (5) Every day. A summary of how many individuals chose each response category can be found in Table A4.",909b8064-ec80-48b7-aad4-ba221e3f94e7
6,methods6," From this data, we constructed a binary index identifying which of the respondents in our sample may be classified as subscribing to a Mediterranean diet (value = 1 if following the diet; 0 if otherwise). In this study, we loosely followed the definition of the Mediterranean diet from earlier studies [24,25] as the daily consumption of fruits or vegetables; and frequent intake of legumes, beans or eggs and meat, fish or poultry. Although the database does not allow us to separate red meat from the other types of meat, we later test if our results are robust to marginal changes in the definition of Mediterranean diet.  2.1.3. Variables Related to Individual Socio-Demographic Characteristics For the analysis, we take into account some individual characteristics available in Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), such as gender (female = 1; male = 0), age, marital status and ethnicity.",7570c763-528e-445b-9ce2-bc096d4f38ae
7,methods7," Marital status was recoded as a binary indicator to reflect if the respondent lives alone (separated, divorced, single, or widowed; value = 1), or lives with a partner, whether married or not (value = 0). We also generated a dummy variable for ethnicity based on the respondent’s declared country of birth. We used the definitions from the US Census ethnicity classification (Hispanic = 1; Non-Hispanic = 0) [26].  2.1.4. Other Personal Traits and Lifestyle Indicators Apart from the characteristics described in 2.1.3, we also include variables related to education (based on the International Standard Classification of Education (International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)) 1997). From this, we generated dummy variables for the highest education level achieved by the individual, whether tertiary, secondary, or primary/none.",63f4b954-1cf1-4efd-a02b-e3414b0d6177
8,methods8," We also recoded the employment status variable from Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) to reflect if the individual is employed (=1) or inactive/retired/unemployed (=0). Annual household income is measured in euros. Specific lifestyle indicators relate to physical activity and smoking behavior. We recoded the original Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) variable on reported frequency of doing vigorous activities: sports, heavy housework, or involvement in a physically taxing job. The resulting variable indicates whether the individual regularly engages in sports/vigorous activities (=1) or hardly/not (=0). We use the Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) variable that gives information if the respondent has ever smoked daily (no = 1; yes = 0).  2.2.",e90c3d63-a764-42c3-8b2f-7459d7c24ee2
9,methods9," Statistical Analysis To test for the relationship between our various health indicators and the Mediterranean diet, lifestyle behaviors and variables related to individual and socio-demographic characteristics, we use a fixed effects model and utilize the software Stata® 14.0 (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA) to perform the regressions.  (1) Yijt=α+β1Medijt+β2Xijt+β3LHijt+β4Xijt2+δj+γt+ϵijt,  where Yijt is one of the three health indicators we are considering (chronic cardio metabolic disorders (CMD), body mass index (BMI), or level of depressive symptoms) for the elderly respondent i interviewed in country j on year t (or wave t), Medijt is a binary variable indicating whether the respondent adheres to the Mediterranean diet or not, Xijt is a vector of individual and socio-demographic characteristics, depending on the specification we are using (gender, age, marital status, ethnicity, education, income and employment status),",ec9600f5-7b82-4a3f-9744-8ec49901fa34
10,methods10," LHijt refers to lifestyle indicators (smoking habits and physical activity), δj and γt are the country and year fixed effects. Xijt2 takes the quadratic form of age and of household income to account for the possibility of a non-linear relationship with these variables. β1 measures the strength of the relationship between the particular health indicator and subscribing to the Mediterranean diet, while β3 reflects the possible association between lifestyle behaviors and the health outcome. For our analyses, we employ three specifications: (1) includes only the Mediterranean diet variable (Medijt); (2) incorporates individual characteristics (i.e., gender, age, marital status and ethnicity) together with the diet variable; and (3) puts (1) and (2) together with the other socio-demographic and lifestyle dimensions (i.e., education, employment, income, physical activity and smoking habits).",0f767204-8473-4da2-9c76-91b6d1d832f3
11,methods11," The fixed effects for the survey year (wave) and country should control for unobserved characteristics that can affect our health indicators associated with the survey year and the countries where the interviews were conducted. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. We restrict our sample to survey respondents aged 50 and above, while putting a cap at 80 years of age to sidestep possible selection bias that may arise. We also exclude data from Israel given our focus on European countries.  3. Results Before going into the main regression results, we perform an exploratory analysis of the data. The descriptive statistics are in Table 1, showing the mean and standard deviations for the variables we use. Results from the statistical analysis are organized according to the health indicator of interest, from Section 3.1 to Section 3.3. Results from a robustness check are in Section 3.4.",60fb7c43-9495-4cc1-9e3f-3cbc9e69a38d
12,methods12,"  Prior to formally testing, we provide graphical overviews on how cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s relate with the different variables we use in the study. In Figure 1, we compare the cardio metabolic disorders (CMD) incidence between those who adhere to the Mediterranean diet and those who do not, by age. The graph clearly indicates that, on average, there is a marked difference in cardio metabolic disorders (CMD) incidence between those following the diet and those who do not—generally showing a lower number of these chronic diseases for those who do subscribe to the diet. We also employ a scatter plot in Figure 2 to show the difference in cardio metabolic disorders (CMD) incidence between those who follow the Mediterranean diet and those who do not, again by age. The difference in cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s is generally greater than zero between those who take the diet and those who do not. This difference increases with age, as depicted by the fitted line.",fb3f30ec-60db-430b-a671-4c120fa080fe
13,methods13,"  Dividing our observations into country groupings using the UN geoscheme for Europe (details in Table A5) and into large age groupings (50−65 and 66−80), Figure 3 shows that individuals in every first age group (50−65) who follow the Mediterranean diet have lower cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s in every country grouping, except those from the South. The black line across the graph indicates the average life expectancy for each country grouping and from which we note that countries in the East have the lowest at 75.4 years. For the higher age bracket, individuals who observe the diet are associated with a lower cardio metabolic disorders (CMD) incidence, except those from Eastern Europe.",85486ced-b6e6-47bb-a99a-89584668bf04
14,methods14,"  Could there also be a difference in cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s in terms of education and employment characteristics? From Figure 4, we can already infer that individuals with the highest level of education (solid green line) are also those with the lowest incidence of cardio metabolic disorders (CMD), at any age. In terms of employment status, we also observe a difference between those who have identified as “Retired” (Figure 5) in the survey and those who continue to be employed or self-employed, with those in the latter group having a lower incidence of diseases.  3.1. Cardio Metabolic Disorders (cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s) Following the results presented in Table 2, in our baseline specification in column (1), we see a strong negative correlation with the Mediterranean diet, without adjusting for the other variables.",36bae72d-9b82-4ab7-a459-b1c3d4368b0b
15,methods15," The strength of the relationship holds when we include individual characteristics (column 2) and the full model including the socio-demographic and lifestyle variables (column 3). However, in column (3), the size of the coefficient for the Mediterranean diet decreases slightly. From this specification, the other variables which are highly correlated (p < 0.01) with cardio metabolic disorders (CMD) are gender, age, age^2, tertiary and secondary levels education (the education variable for primary/none is omitted due to collinearity), smoking, employment status and engagement in sports/vigorous physical activities. Ethnicity is also significant (p < 0.05).  3.2. Body-Mass Index (body mass index (BMI)) For the results related with body mass index (BMI) (Table 3), we find no significant association relating with adherence to the Mediterranean diet for any of the specifications.",a3fe2632-0315-4420-b8cb-8a2fb9ac536a
16,methods16," We do find highly significant negative correlations with being female (columns 2 and 3), having more education, being engaged in sports and being employed (column 3). In fact, we observe that having tertiary level education (p < 0.01) has the strongest negative relationship with body mass index (BMI) in terms of magnitude, in comparison with all the other variables in column (3). The variables related to age are also highly significant, indicating that growing older is correlated with higher body mass index (BMI), but only up to a certain point since the variable age^2 has a negative sign (both columns 2 and 3). We also note that respondents who have indicated that they do not/never have smoked daily seem to be associated with higher body mass index (BMI) levels. Ethnicity loses significance when adjusted for other variables in the third specification.  3.3. Depressive Symptoms Table 4 presents the results related to depressive symptoms. We find a negative and significant (p < 0.",26404773-7782-4b12-b0db-1056af780e10
17,methods17,"05) relationship between following the Mediterranean diet and depressive symptoms, indicating that respondents who follow the diet are likely to report lower levels of depressive symptoms (column 1). Similar to the case with cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s, the size of the correlation holds, with just a slight drop, even when adjusted for other characteristics (columns 2 and 3). However, differing from the results in Table 2, being female shows a positive and highly significant (p < 0.01) association with depressive symptoms (column 2), which remains significant even after the inclusion of other variables (column 3). Having no partner/living alone and being Hispanic are also observed to be positive and strongly significant in relation with depressive symptoms, though ethnicity is only significant at the 5% level once adjusted for the other variables (column 3). Education also seems to have a highly significant relationship (p < 0.",abcc14c8-a5f1-488e-aaed-1b3003c3a443
18,methods18,"01), indicating those with higher levels (tertiary) are associated with lower reported depressive symptoms. Engagement in sports, not having been habitual smokers, and being employed are also highly (p < 0.01) and negatively correlated with depressive symptom levels. As with the other health outcomes, the age variables are highly significant for specifications 2 and 3, with age having a negative coefficient, while that of age^2 is positive.  The household income variables are only significant in relation with depressive symptoms, though the magnitudes of the relationship are almost zero.  3.4. Robustness Check As a robustness check, we calibrate the consumption frequency of the meat and the legumes components of our Mediterranean diet variable and run the analysis using specifications (1) and (3) described in Section 2.2. The results are in Table 5 where we see that the direction of the main results are unaffected by marginal changes in the definition of the Mediterranean diet.  4.",d135f3c4-4267-46c0-b131-bc446553a678
19,methods19," Discussion Our results confirmed a highly significant and negative relationship between the Mediterranean diet and two of our health outcomes. We saw that individuals following this diet were associated with a lower incidence of cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s and lower levels of depressive symptoms. The magnitude of the association declined slightly when we adjusted for the covariates, but the significance remained stable (p < 0.05). These results follow in the tradition of previous studies that have found positive links between the Mediterranean diet and health in older adults [27,28,29], though ours has implications for Europe in general with the use of our broadly-scoped sample. The results were also robust when we calibrated the composition of our Mediterranean diet variable to slightly reduce the frequency of meats and legumes consumption, where we even observed a higher level of significance (p < 0.01) and magnitude in relation with the level of depressive symptoms.",1b7f09b9-7117-4ba7-8220-e498acfbb902
20,methods20," We note from the literature, however, that the age factor still leaves more to be explored in relation with mental well-being in old age [30,31], thus we focus only on the direction of the relationship from the results. For body mass index (BMI), we found no significant links with the Mediterranean diet. We are mindful of the limitations of the usefulness of body mass index (BMI) as a measure of health [32,33] so additional information is likely called for to be able to provide a better analysis in relating this diet with body mass index (BMI).  In line with our hypothesis, those who were more active and occupied, in terms of sports or employment, were shown to be less likely to have more cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s, tended to have lower body mass index (BMI), and reported to be less depressive symptomatic.",0a623128-a25e-4849-806a-4fd350a844a6
21,methods21," This is consistent with studies mentioning the value of continued engagement in economic activities and more physical activity in having lesser cardiovascular problems, other chronic illnesses and overall better health [15,18,34,35,36,37]. In addition, apart from the healthy lifestyle habit of engaging in sports, not being a regular smoker was also linked with better health (i.e., lower cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s and lower levels of depressive symptoms). However, we observed that the correlation between non-habitual smoking and body mass index (BMI) was positive. This is not an unusual result following previous studies showing that discontinuance of smoking tends to be associated with weight gain [38,39,40].  As previously mentioned, health and well-being in older adults are complex and multifaceted themes.",e0f2e926-ab8d-4a46-ac06-86c6cad8b6fd
22,methods22," Given this, it would be noteworthy to highlight the results for our covariates which generally conform with what has been shown in the literature, giving more credence to our analysis. This may also open avenues for future research. For instance, we found that being female was highly associated with lesser cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s. Older women in our sample were less likely to have higher cardio metabolic disorders (CMD) incidence. Though there are studies which point out that “women may be underrepresented in research on heart disease” and likely misdiagnosed [41,42]. But when it came to mental well-being, our study indicated that being female tended to be correlated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. Previous studies in this area share the consensus that older women have an elevated risk for depressive symptoms, are increasingly diagnosed with depressive disorders and are less positive with regard to their perceived health in comparison with men [41,43,44,45,46].",bcd09768-d2fa-464d-b94f-edc6ba066e07
23,methods23," In more stable standing, health literature has established the protective factor provided by education [47,48,49]. Our results confirmed this negative association with our health outcomes, where tertiary level education in particular showed larger magnitudes versus that for the secondary level. Being Hispanic was associated with worse health outcomes. This would be consistent with studies showing that mortality rates from diabetes tend to be higher for Hispanics than non-Hispanics, and a larger proportion with chronic illnesses [50,51,52]. Nonetheless, we note the limitation of our ethnicity variable before drawing any conclusions. The variable was generated based on the respondent’s declared country of birth, implying an imperfect measure to determine true ethnicity.  Lastly, the state of living with a partner or not (from marital status) seems to have an interesting relationship with health.",7763fde4-f5c1-471d-95e8-5237314b1af8
24,methods24," We found that living apart from one’s partner (or being single, widowed) in old age was found to be strongly correlated with higher levels of reported depressive symptoms, similar to existing literature [53,54]. However, not living with a partner seemed to be linked with lower levels of body mass index (BMI)—consistent with some studies that show “transitions out of marriage are associated with weight loss” [55,56]. It may certainly be argued that the quality of the relationship is an important characteristic to take into account, although this aspect is outside the scope of our study. However, the main results draw attention to the importance of relationships relative to the quality of life [57] and could be compelling to explore in a future study.  5.",2e68eea0-14d8-479f-a8a0-5d529f31876d
25,methods25," Conclusions The main findings of our study confirmed the direct association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and a lower incidence of cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s, and with lower levels of reported depressive symptoms among older adults. We also confirmed that regular vigorous physical activity and non-habitual smoking were associated with fewer cardio metabolic disorders (CMD)s and better mental well-being. We reached these results while accounting for the multidimensionality of these health outcomes—by controlling for several individual and socio-demographic characteristics. In addition, our study extends the current latitude of the literature given that the evaluation was within the context of a large longitudinal sample covering 27 European countries.",d618f5f8-fa95-46fd-8bc3-d2342cff9682
26,methods26," These findings, having been situated in a broader geographic setting, emphasize the importance of formulating a holistic program when caring for the elderly, not least among them mindful attention to diet and nutrition. ",2f33a6bf-d651-4407-82bd-60c5bf988983
