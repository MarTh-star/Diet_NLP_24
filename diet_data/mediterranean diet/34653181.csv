Patients  Eighty patients (forty women and forty men) affected by overweight/obesity and T2DM or prediabetes age (years): 51.95 ± 1.75; BMI (kg/m2): 33.08 ± 1.83; HA1c (%): 6.5% ± 0.25) were enrolled at the University Service of Diet Therapy, Diabetology and Metabolic Diseases, Policlinico Riuniti Hospital of Foggia, Puglia, Italy.  The 80 patients were divided into two groups of 40 and distributed as follows. In the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED group 20 patients was overweight and had a form of prediabetes, of which 5 women with impaired glucose tolerance and 5 women with impaired fasting glucose and 5 men with impaired fasting glucose and 5 men with impaired glucose tolerance while 20 patients was obese, 10 women and 10 men, and had type 2 diabetes. The VLCD_MED group had the same composition. Overweight patients with prediabetes and obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were equally distributed between the two groups.",8162a10f-e2e7-42e4-b99a-12844733a89b
1,methods1," The 50/50 gender balance in each group was predetermined before the start of the study.  The inclusion criteria were BMI (kg/m2) > 25, age > 18 years and < 65 years, their current diet consisting of at least 50% of their daily energy intake in carbohydrates, normal renal and hepatic function, overweight/obesity, and T2DM or impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose. The exclusion criteria included: previous conditions of gout or hyperuricemia, pregnancy or breast-feeding absence of any other diseases other than T2DM, altered glucose tolerance, or impaired glucose tolerance. After starting the experimental protocol, all patients suspended oral hypoglycaemic agents. Participants were informed of the potential hazards and discomforts by written and oral information. Before taking part in the study, all patients provided written consent. The study was approved by Ethics Committee (Reference: CT22_2018), and it was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  2.2.",438afa45-f8c4-47fb-9912-cfb2c7b769e6
2,methods2," Experimental Design  Over thirty days, a two-arm parallel controlled not-randomized pilot trial was implemented to test the effects of a very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet on glycol metabolic blood parameters, weight loss, and body composition compared with a very-low-calorie Mediterranean diet.  As the adopted study design is a small-scale pilot trial, no sample size was calculated. Retrospectively, a sample size based on the mean difference in HbA1c (%) and calculated SD observed in previous studies [27] identified a number of 15 participants per group as the sample size needed to detect a hypothetical treatment effect for a before-and-after study with a significance level of 5% and a study power of 80%. As a result, the number of patients participating in this study is statistically appropriate.",915e5dfe-2576-4f38-a365-e28439931f65

Anthropometric and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis Measures  The anthropometric characteristics were measured and are listed below: weight, height, body mass index, and waist and hip circumferences.  Bodyweight was measured at each visit on the same scale with the subject wearing light clothing, with shoes and socks removed, to the nearest 0.1 kg using an electronic scale with bioimpedance analysis (InBody 770. Co., Ltd., 625 Eonju-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, Korea) and height was measured to the nearest 1 cm using a stadiometer (InBody BSM170 Co., Ltd.",8972722d-f609-4d44-b981-83c2ebafcec5

8,methods8," Diet Program  Patients independently prepared the two diets at home each day, using the following cooking methods: steam, boiling, cooking and grilling. Personal dietary intake was measured by weighted dietary diaries, compiled by patients and sent every five days by email to registered dieticians. In addition, every ten days, group meetings were held between the registered dieticians and patients to gather general feedback, assess diet adherence and provide help.  2.4.1. Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Mediterranean Diet Characteristics  The very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet was formulated according to the ketogenic diet criteria but adopting as many foods as possible from the Mediterranean diet. The aim was to obtain the condition of “Mediterranean” ketosis, induce weight loss, and improve gluco-metabolic parameters while preserving lean mass through an adequate amount of protein without configuring the diet as a high-protein diet.",a2306d6e-fd67-4c01-b9e4-5013f34c701c
9,methods9,"  For the very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet, a protein intake of 1.2–1.4 g/kg/ideal body weight for men was used, while for women, the protein intake was 1.1–1.2 g/kg/ideal body weight.  The ideal body weight was calculated with the inverse formula of BMI (kg/m2) using a target value of BMI (kg/m2) of 22, so the proteins represented on average 32 percent of daily calories, with differences between the patients according to individual needs and body composition. The daily calorie intake was around 800 kcal/day, configuring a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet.  The maximum daily carbohydrate intake was set to less than 50 g to reduce blood glucose and insulin and obtain the hepatic production of ketones through the consequent rapid activation of lipolysis. Carbohydrate intake averaged 20 g per day, based on the number of vegetables consumed, and represented 10 percent of daily calories.",af964521-deef-4e27-9e76-78cf7e5c0cc0
10,methods10,"  The amount of lipids was about 52 g, corresponding to 58 percent of daily calories of fat per day, most of which are of plant origin, also obtained from extra virgin olive oil and oleaginous fruits. The extra virgin olive oil amounted to 20 g consumed during the day, adding to the lipid contents of white meat and fish.  The breakfast consists of oleaginous fruit such as nuts, almonds, cashews, pistachios, and peanuts. Unsweetened soft drinks such as herbal teas, tea, and coffee were used as they do not interfere with the condition of ketosis and increase compliance with the diet of the enrolled patients.  A two-course meal was provided for lunch: one based on white meat or fish and a second course based on cooked or raw green vegetables. The patients could choose from two lists of vegetables.",22e96656-bfd7-4300-b2c1-31a6e2435689
11,methods11,"  The first list included the vegetables that the patient could eat in a maximum amount of 200 g per day, as the carbohydrate component of these vegetables, if consumed in larger amounts than those indicated, exceeds the daily limit of 50 g. The second list includes the vegetables that patients could eat in free quantities, given that their limited carbohydrate contents do not exceed the maximum daily carbohydrate limits.  With regard to white meat or fish, the patient could choose from a list of foods that varied daily, provided that fish was consumed at least four times a week. The portions of white meat or fish were assigned according to the individual protein and body composition requirements. White meat or fish can be replaced with eggs no more than two times a week, or tuna, squid, cuttlefish, or octopus.",3998cb59-5ad4-400f-a6b7-f0e5a2391fe3
12,methods12,"  Other than water, no less than 2 L per day, there was also an allowed amount of red wine equal to 150 mL per day, typical of the Mediterranean diet, which has remarkable antioxidant properties. Dinner follows the same pattern as lunch: a portion of white meat or fish and a portion of cooked or raw green vegetables with extra virgin olive oil. Wine is not allowed for dinner. Table 2 shows the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED food list.  The need for minerals, vitamins, and fibers is filled from the various vegetables and relative amount choices. In fact, patients of both dietary groups were encouraged to eat vegetables, especially those included in the free quantities list, and to exceed the recommended daily serving size, varying the choice and combination of the vegetables as much as possible [30].",f21deb3f-d798-4e36-aa5e-0df80610a439

The daily carbohydrate intake exceeded 50 g, so the hepatic production of ketones did not occur.  Unlike the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED diet, the VLCD_MED has no limitations in the choice of foods, where the total daily energy intake represents the only limitation. The lipids are of plant origin and are consumed through extra virgin olive oil, consumed during the day, and added to the lipid contents of white meat and fish.

Diets Scores  The Mediterranean diet serving score [31] was applied to calculate the adherence of the very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet to the characteristics of the Mediterranean diet based on the Mediterranean food pyramid. This index ranges from 0 to 24 points for an adult and from 0 to 23 for a teenager; a score of 1, 2, or 3 is given for each item and 0 is given if the number of servings is lower or higher than the recommended ones.

17,methods17," The higher the total score, the greater the adherence to the Mediterranean diet.  Although alcohol is not mandatory in the Mediterranean diet, the use of wine, particularly red wine, is advisable for the intake of polyphenols and resveratrol [32]. In addition, alcohol can increase conviviality and, therefore, adherence to the diet. Patients were strongly encouraged to favor the use of white meat and mainly fish as protein sources.

This was determined by a pre-selection of patients, which allowed us, even before starting the study, to identify the patients that were most motivated to follow the diet regimen. So, patients were chosen for eligibility, and eligibility was correlated with diet compliance; therefore, this research is not a random population study.  3.1.

The Mediterranean diet serving calculated for the very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet has a value of twelve, which is therefore within the reference range. The Mediterranean diet serving score computed for the very-low-calorie Mediterranean diet has a higher score, equal to sixteen, thanks to the cereals, legumes, fresh fruits, and all types of vegetables included in it, so it is different compared with Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED.",ae2f264d-b88d-4e0a-bde8-f4f7a3eafa5a

Discussion  The main findings of the present study may be summarized in terms of a decrease in weight (kg) and BMI (kg/m2) and in a positive remodulation of metabolic parameters other than an improvement in body composition parameters. The results suggest that the very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet, or Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED, caused a significant and more extensive decrease compared to the very-low-calorie Mediterranean, or VLCD_MED, diet, in body weight, and also produced an improvement in body composition parameters and several metabolic markers linked to prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and risk of cardiovascular disease.  Other authors have successfully studied the Mediterranean ketogenic diet. In 2008, Guisado et al.",9256acb6-ea6b-405b-90ef-1193305bd3b6
28,methods31," [36] proposed the first Spanish ketogenic Mediterranean diet as an efficient method for reducing body fat, improving non-atherogenic lipid profiles, lowering blood pressure and optimizing fasting glucose levels, and as an effective and safe way to treat patients suffering from metabolic syndrome and associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. More recently, in 2011, Paoli et al. [37] proposed a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet, defined as the KEMEPHY diet, achieving good results in reducing body weight and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight and obese patients.  However, both Mediterranean ketogenic diets have different characteristics. The Spanish ketogenic Mediterranean diet is an unlimited-calorie diet. The KEMEPHY Mediterranean ketogenic with phytoextracts diet protocol had a daily calorie content between 1000 and 1200 Kcal and provided the use of phytocompounds, with beta-adrenergic action stimulating lipolysis.",8815aecc-2713-4350-9193-7d7395805183
29,methods32," So, both approaches, though developed as Mediterranean ketogenic diets, are not very-low-calorie ketogenic diet and, in the case of Paoli, include the use of herbal extracts that can enhance lipolysis regardless of nutritional intervention.  Conversely, the proposed dietary regimen is an exclusively nutritional intervention and is a very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet [38,39]  Moreover, according to the previously published research, the reduction in appetite resulted from ketone production, and the higher effect on satiety is due to the use of proteins, which are linked to appetite control hormones such as ghrelin, amylin, and leptin [40,41,42]. For this purpose, capillary ß-hydroxybutyrate concentration was measured as a direct and reliable index of the occurrence of ketosis. If an increase in the blood concentration of ketones had not been detected, the purpose of the diet to induce the ketosis process would not have been achieved.",e95e7e31-9422-41d1-924d-f86cd95311a7
30,methods33,"  The absence of significant variations in the blood concentrations of the hepatic function indices, GOT (U/L), GPT (U/L), GGT (U/L), and serum creatinine allowed us to exclude any adverse changes in hepatic and renal function due to both dietary interventions.  Furthermore, satisfying results were obtained with Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED compared to the VLCD_MED diet in improving the anthropometric and body compositions bioimpedance parameters, significantly and more intensely reducing body weight (kg), waist circumference (cm), hip circumference (cm), BMI (kg/m2), WHR (ratio) FM (kg), basal metabolism (kcal), and total body water (kg), with no significant differences in free fat mass expressed in kilograms (FFM) (kg). However, the reduction in the basal metabolism and the total body water pre- and post-diet for both diets, considered as numerical absolute magnitude values, are clinically insignificant.",e7b1b842-fcba-47e7-aa0c-d00a53d7b9fb
31,methods34,"  Additionally, Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED, compared to the VLCD_MED diet, showed a substantial improvement with a significantly stronger reduction in the levels of fasting blood glucose (mg/dL), insulin (µU/mL), glycosylated hemoglobin (%), HOMA index, C peptide (ng/mL), total cholesterol (mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (mg/dL), triglyceridemia (mg/dL), and aspartate aminotransferase (U/L), with no difference between the diets for HDL cholesterol (mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase (U/L), gamma-glutamyl transferase (U/L), and serum creatinine (mg/dL). Interestingly, there is a significant reduction in C-peptide (ng/mL). This result suggests, together with the reduction in HOMA index, an improvement in insulin resistance that is strictly connected to a well-balanced gluco-metabolic condition.",b3d710d4-bc63-4f97-882a-101dd1d19396
32,methods35,"  The proposed nutritional treatment has also been effective in influencing blood lipoprotein values, with a significant decrease in total cholesterol (mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (mg/dL), and triglycerides (mg/dL), without a substantial reduction in the value of HDL (mg/dL). These results positively impact lipid profile control, slowing down or even stopping prediabetes and diabetes complications such as cardiovascular [43] or microvascular diseases [44].  Otherwise, the very-low-calorie Mediterranean diet shows a substantially smaller decrease in all anthropometric, body composition and gluco-metabolic parameters and therefore has not led to an unbalanced gluco-metabolic and lipidic control.  Despite the very low caloric intake, both diets have no free fat mass expressed in kilograms (FFM) (kg) reduction.",e9823ff1-7008-4141-9f54-31155442bd78
33,methods36," This is probably correlated with protein intake, which exerted a protein sparing effect on muscle mass and inhibited muscle catabolism, as already documented by other publications [45,46].  This pilot study was conducted in preparation for a larger successful future RCT to explore the efficiency and internal validity of the proposed trial.  Moreover, this study is an absolute novelty for the type of nutritional intervention adopted, a method of intervention that is currently very poorly investigated in the scientific medical literature, namely the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED.",cf461fec-d50e-4515-a731-36ae5d2ba7cb
34,methods37,"  The duration of only thirty days of the nutritional intervention has been determined in consideration of the following elements:- The production kinetics of blood beta butyrate hydroxy reaches almost the maximum concentration value on the twentieth day, as demonstrated by Cahill and Veech [47];  - The lipolysis rate begins on the tenth day and reaches a plateau on the twentieth [48];  - The short duration ensures maximum patient compliance and avoids patients dropping out during the very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet.  Even if the diet period was only very short, combining the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet with the Mediterranean diet means selecting the best elements of the two diets. The fusion of the two types of diet leads to effects on fasting blood glucose, lipid profiles, and rapid weight and fat loss, with the preservation of lean mass and with total compliance of patients.",14970ab9-3f62-449f-9ca5-d071a35524de
35,methods38," The patients benefit at the same time from the protective nutritional, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties deriving from Mediterranean foods such as vegetables, oleaginous fruit, extra virgin olive oil, and wine [49], and as confirmed by the total ORAC and PRAL values, along with the scores of the Mediterranean diet serving and Mediterranean adequacy index.  5. Conclusions  We have demonstrated that the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED, compared with the VLCD_MED diet, exerts a stronger positive effect not only on anthropometric and body composition parameters, but also and most especially on gluco-metabolic and lipidic control, even if over a short time of only thirty days, in overweight/obese patients with prediabetes or non-insulin-dependent T2D, without any worsening of hepatic or kidney function.",d27e881c-c265-4b10-bbe1-5418f24ddd74
36,methods39,"  The novelty of our approach is to have combined the many health advantages of the Mediterranean diet, with the positive effects of the state of “nutritional ketosis” to improves gluco-metabolic and lipid control, reduce body weight and change the body composition and consequently reduce cardio-vascular risk factors, of in overweight/obese people with prediabetes or T2D.  Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first exclusively nutritional intervention conducted in Italy based on the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet combined with the Mediterranean diet, without phytoextracts or drugs, over a very short time period, to testify to and confirm the effectiveness of the method discussed in this work, but further studies are needed to clarify the potential use of this diet approach in preventing and/or treating prediabetes or diabetes and overweight/obesity.
