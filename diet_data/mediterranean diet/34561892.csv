0,methods0," Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents  All participants received information about the study and gave written consent to participate. Ethical approval was given by the Ethical Committee of Lund University, Lund, Sweden (LU 90-51).  Study Population  Data were obtained from the Malmö Diet and Cancer study (Malmö Diet and Cancer study (MDCS)), which is a population-based prospective cohort study from the city of Malmö, Sweden. Between 1991 and 1996, men born in 1923–1945 and women born 1923–1950 living in Malmö were deemed eligible and invited to participate. Exclusion criteria were language problems and mental incapacity, which could preclude participants from fulfilling the questionnaires properly.",a8012b9d-6507-4c6b-91f2-9df9b60f251f
1,methods1," In all, 30,446 individuals attended at least a part of the baseline examination, which included a self-administrated questionnaire that assessed education, occupation, physical activity, social network, use of tobacco and alcohol, current health, medical history, current medication, and family history of disease in close relatives, along with body composition measurements and dietary assessments. Participation reached 40.8% of the eligible population.6  A subpopulation of the study participants underwent lumbar puncture with analyses of CSF Aβ42 when referred to the Memory clinic at Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, after developing clinical signs of cognitive impairment. This represents a convenience subsample of the Malmö Diet and Cancer study (MDCS) and should not be regarded as a representative subsample of the whole study.",3bc932be-5e1d-4604-be2f-803e6f839a26
2,methods2,"  Dietary Assessments and Method  Information on dietary habits was obtained from all participants at baseline through (1) a diet diary and (2) a self-administered FFQ, which provided complementary information, and (3) a 45–60 minute interview with trained personnel.7 Detailed information on the dietary data collection procedure, including administration of the FFQ and diary, was given at the first visit by trained research nurses. In the 7-day food diary, participants recorded cooked meals, cold beverages, drugs, natural remedies, and dietary supplements. In the 168-item FFQ participants stated, with reference period last year, regularly consumed foods not covered by the food diary (i.e., breakfast and snacks), portion size (based on pictures of 4 portion sizes for 48 food items), and frequency of food consumed.",c129d2cb-8a68-4bd9-9a90-53137584dc30
3,methods3," In addition, participants underwent a 1-hour interview with trained personnel collecting additional information on cooking methods, food choices, and portion sizes and to make sure the information from the diary and FFQ was correct. Halfway through the baseline data collection (in 1994), the interview routines changed to reduce interview time to 45 minutes.8 Average daily food intake (g/d) was calculated by combining the data from the food diary and the FFQ. Energy and nutrient intakes were calculated by combining the data on average food intake with the Malmö Diet and Cancer study (MDCS) database originating from the Swedish National Food agency database. The combined dietary method used in Malmö Diet and Cancer study (MDCS) has been validated against 18 days of weighted food records with correlation coefficients for men/women of 0.60/0.74 for sugar, 0.74/0.69 for fiber, 0.65/0.58 for vegetables, 0.60/0.77 for fruits, 0.35/0.65 for fish, 0.82/0.91 for meat, and 0.50/0.65 for wine.",1efbebd0-34df-4aa5-9f75-1baa13fb36e9
4,methods4,"7,9  Swedish Dietary Guidelines Score and Modified Mediterranean Diet Score  A Swedish dietary guidelines score (Swedish dietary guidelines score (SDGS)), designed to portray a healthy dietary pattern, based on Swedish nutrition recommendations and dietary guidelines,10 which are in line with dietary recommendations in the United States11 and United Kingdom,12 was calculated for each participant based on average daily food intake. The Swedish dietary guidelines score (SDGS) is based on consumption of 5 dietary domains: dietary fiber ≥2.4 g/MJ from nonalcohol energy; added sugar ≤10% of nonalcohol energy; fish and shellfish ≥300 g/wk; fruit and vegetables ≥400 g/d; and red and processed meat ≤500 g/wk. Reaching recommendations yielded 1 point/domain, with a maximum Swedish dietary guidelines score (SDGS) of 5 points. A similar index has previously been developed within Malmö Diet and Cancer study (MDCS).",72325442-85b7-41f7-acff-46f2a07e435b
5,methods5,"13 In the modified index, we included added sugar (instead of sucrose) and red and processed meat (instead of saturated and polyunsaturated fat). Based on the Swedish dietary guidelines score (SDGS), participants were divided into the following groups: low adherence (0–1 points), moderate adherence (2–3 points), and high adherence (4–5 points).  A modified Mediterranean diet score (mMDS) was created based on the original 14-item score used for the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED)) study.14 The mMDS consists of 10 dietary domains: (1) Vegetable oils (≥54 g/d); (2) Vegetables including legumes (≥300 g/d); (3) Fruits (≥300 g/d); 4) Red and processed meat (<125 g/d); (5) Butter, margarine, cream (<12 g/d); (6) Soda (<200 g/d); (7) Wine (≥100 g/d); (8) Fish and seafood (≥53.6 or ≥85.7 g/d, respectively); (9) Pastries and candy (<21.4 or <12.8 g/d, respectively); and (10) Nuts and seeds (≥12.8 g/d).",38a98d41-e7da-40d5-9d7e-39c92e3551f7
6,methods6," Reaching recommendations yielded 1 point/domain with a maximum mMDS of 10 points (meets all recommendations). Domain “legumes” was incorporated in the vegetable domain. In addition, “sofrito,” a typical Mediterranean sauce, was excluded in the mMDS because of low consumption in Nordic countries and the lack of information from the food records. Two domains were further excluded from the index (olive oil as main culinary lipid and poultry more than red meats) because of lack of questions referring to this in the present FFQ.14 However, the consumption of olive oil was added to the intake of other vegetable oils because the consumption of these oils is usually low in the Nordic population. Based on the mMDS, participants were divided into the following groups: low adherence (0–1 points), moderate adherence (2–4 points), and high adherence (5–10 points).",b792f8a0-1089-4b27-a8f4-b12db54ed97f
7,methods7," The regrouping was performed to have enough discrepancies between groups regarding dietary habits and to avoid too small groups (eTable 1, links.lww.com/WNL/C345).  A Mediterranean diet score according to a study15 was calculated scoring 0–50 (poor to good adherence to Mediterranean diet recommendations). The original score is from 0 to 55, but here, the domain legumes was incorporated in the domain “vegetables” because of low consumption in Nordic population. As in the case of mMDS, all vegetable oils were considered rather than olive oil alone (eTable 2, links.lww.com/WNL/C345).  Covariates  Sociodemographic factors included age, sex, and education. At baseline, participants completed a questionnaire including lifestyle factors and health status. Education level was divided into 3 subgroups as per study design: primary/elementary school (≤8 years), secondary school/high school (9–12 years), or higher education/university (≥13 years), based on information from the questionnaire.",e275625c-bf49-4585-9a37-f273a832a6f0
8,methods8," From the questionnaire smoking status was divided into 3 groups (smokers, former smokers, and never smokers) and physical activity as metabolic equivalent hours/week (METh/week). One METh is defined as the metabolic intensity when a person is at rest. METh/week was computed by multiplying time (hours) spent on each activity by the respective MET (intensity) factor.2 Information on alcohol consumption was derived both from the questionnaire and the 7-day record. Zero consumers had reported no consumption during the past year. The other participants were stratified in quintiles separately in men and women (because of alcohol consumption and daily recommendations differ between men and women), with the following spans: 0–3.4, 3.4–9.1, 15.7, and 25.7 g/d (men) and 0–0.9, 4.3, 8.1, and 14.0 g/d (women). APOE-ɛ4 interaction analysis was performed to investigate a potentiating effect of this well-established genetic risk factor for AD.",3b271eb3-6406-4812-b5fb-edf90f876605
9,methods9," Owing to possible seasonal variations in dietary intake, and that dietary interview was shortened in 1994, season and diet assessment method were included in the analyses.  Outcomes  The primary outcome was progression to all-cause dementia disorders. The secondary outcomes were progression to AD dementia and VaD. The exploratory outcome was abnormal Aβ status measured as increased levels of CSF Aβ42 (see Exploratory outcome CSF Aβ42 below).  The primary and secondary diagnostic outcomes were based on registered dementia diagnoses from the Swedish National Patient Register (National Patient Register (NPR)) throughout 2014. The National Patient Register (NPR) covers both the Swedish Inpatient Register and the hospital-based outpatient register. Diagnoses included AD dementia (ICD-10 and ICD-9 codes F00, G30, 331A/331.0), VaD (F01, 290E/290.4), Parkinson disease dementia (F023), dementia with Lewy bodies (F028, G318A), frontotemporal dementia (F020, G310, 331B/331.",44ac937f-50c3-4a9c-963d-cdef2555ecdf
10,methods10,"1), or unspecified dementia (F03, 290, 294B/294.1, 331C/331.2). After the register data delivery, trained physicians with special interest in dementias, but not yet board-certified specialists, at the Memory Clinic at Skåne University Hospital reviewed and validated all registered dementia diagnoses based on symptoms, results of cognitive tests, brain imaging (CT or magnetic resonance imaging reviewed by radiologists), and CSF concentrations of Aβ42 and tau phosphorylated at Thr181 (p-tau, when available) in accordance with the specific major neurocognitive disorders in DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). In uncertain cases, 2 specialists in Neurology and Geriatrics, (O.H. and K.N.), respectively, with more than 10 years of experience in the field of dementia were involved. In cases where CSF was available, AD diagnosis was based on the NIA-AA criteria.16 Of the 1,943 cases with dementia, 1,507 (77.",d730955d-8af5-492f-b60b-ed17af9391d3
11,methods11,"6%) were diagnosed at a specialized Memory Clinic.  The secondary outcomes were defined as pure AD, mixed AD and vascular pathology, and VaD. Information from neuroimaging was used to validate VaD and to differentiate between pure AD and AD with cerebrovascular disease (mixed AD and vascular pathology). Presence of significant cerebrovascular disease on neuroimaging led to a mixed AD diagnosis if AD was considered the primary cause.  Exploratory Outcome—CSF Aβ42  CSF data were available for participants with signs of cognitive decline who had been referred to the Memory Clinic at Skåne University Hospital for further investigation. With lumbar puncture, CSF was collected between 1995 and 2015 according to a structured protocol.19 CSF concentrations of Aβ42 were measured using INNOTEST ELISA (Fujirebio Europe, Ghent, Belgium).  Cut-off values for CSF Aβ42 were established using mixture modeling.",0aa3334c-6489-4195-8d7a-3605eb1779cf
12,methods12,"17-22 Because of a slight, assay-dependent drift in levels of CSF Aβ42 during the collection period 1995–2015, 2 different cutoffs were established for the period 1995–2003 (Aβ42 < 484.8 pg/mL) and 2004–2015 (Aβ42 < 577.1 pg/mL). This drift in INNOTEST CSF Aβ42 values during this period is well known.19  Statistical Analyses  Demographic data are presented as means (SDs) or numbers (n) and percent (%). Cox proportional hazard models, with years between baseline and event as time variable, were used to examine associations between Swedish dietary guidelines score (SDGS) and mMDS and risk of developing dementia. Event was defined as all-cause dementia (primary outcome) or specific dementia disorder (secondary outcome). Censoring occurred at the recorded date of dementia, time of death, or at time of register data delivery (December 31, 2014).",238e365e-7bc9-478c-8658-0ab46a83fd99
13,methods13," By using this approach, the competing risk of death was assessed by estimating cause-specific hazard ratio (HR) for dementia, in accordance with recommendations when the study objective is etiologic.23 All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education, season, dietary sampling method, and total energy intake (kJ) in model 1. In model 2, the following lifestyle variables were also included: smoking (current, former, never), alcohol consumption (sex-specific quintiles), body mass index, and physical activity (METh/week). In model 2, a total of 243 cases had missing data in any of these lifestyle variables and were thus excluded. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between Swedish dietary guidelines score (SDGS) and Aβ42 accumulation, using CSF Aβ42 status as outcome.  In sensitivity analyses, participants diagnosed with dementia <5 years from baseline were excluded, to reduce the possible bias of cognitive impairment affecting dietary intake24 (i.e.",e5be220c-fa82-493d-bf08-5e2a6b7a9aa5

In another sensitivity analysis, participants with prevalent and incident diabetes mellitus were excluded to investigate the dietary association without being influenced by diabetes and the dietary restrictions that may accompany that disease.25 A total of 5,221 participants with diabetes were excluded; of which, 405 developed dementia. Sensitivity analysis was also performed excluding participants that had made substantial changes in their dietary habits at any time before the baseline examination. In addition, another sensitivity analysis was performed only including individuals diagnosed at the Memory Clinic. Using the Mediterranean diet score according to a study15 was used in another sensitivity analysis.  All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.6.3).

Furthermore, diet was not associated with presence of Aβ pathology at follow-up.  The main strengths of this study were the prospective study design, the large sample size, the long follow-up time of almost 20 years, and the dietary assessment method of high quality, where FFQ was complemented by interviews, which improves the validity of the dietary data.13 In addition, the dementia diagnoses were validated by trained physicians at a Memory Clinic and are not merely register-based as in several previous publications.",5f078019-9999-45a2-863f-f75bf788fed6

In a large prospective cohort study (n = 10,308), with a median follow-up time of 24.8 years, neither the quality of midlife diet nor the Mediterranean diet was associated with incident all-cause dementia,26 which was confirmed by another prospective and longitudinal study with 20 years of follow-up including 13,588 participants showing no association of diet quality and further development of dementia or cognitive decline.",20e8bfcf-10b4-4598-89ab-7773f47e1a8c

A systematic review3 including 32 studies, concluded that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may contribute to better cognitive performance and decreased risk of developing dementia. This review reflects the current state of knowledge because the studies included are very heterogeneous in their designs. A majority of them used retrospective FFQs, which may be associated with misreporting by the participants considering difficulties to remember historical details about food intake many years or even decades back in time.29 In addition, a majority of the studies included in the review are based on dietary habits in older populations (older than 65 years).",cd5a8f6b-1de0-4207-9a83-378ab92b3079
26,discussion3," Considering the relatively high prevalence of prodromal dementias in such populations, there is a risk of reversed causality. Early cognitive decline with possible mood changes could also affect dietary lifestyle habits.30 Hence, inclusion of an older population may bias the correlation between diet quality and cognitive decline. In addition, the varying follow-up time between studies might be one reason of the heterogeneous study results regarding dietary habits and incidence of dementia disorders. However, the authors of the systematic review concluded and emphasized the importance of confirmation based on large longitudinal epidemiologic studies with prospective registration of dietary habits, thus highlighting the value of this study. As expected, known cardiovascular risk factors such as coronary event or stroke, diabetes, and arterial hypertension were all more common at baseline in the group with incident dementia (Table 1).",a46acf02-b60b-4e19-bb65-d4182d66d0bd
27,discussion4,"  This study does not exclude a possible association between diet quality and subsequent development of dementia. However, the present Swedish dietary recommendations, which are in line with those in the United Kingdom and United States, or according to the Mediterranean dietary pattern, could not be confirmed to be associated with prevention of dementia. There is however a risk of self-reported dietary and lifestyle habits being misreported to some extent. There is also a possible risk of alteration in dietary habits, although dietary habits remain relatively stable during life. Previous studies on diet and CSF Aβ measures are either cross-sectional31,32 or have short follow-up time (4 weeks–1.2 years).33 This further highlights the importance of this study examining the association between dietary habits and later CSF Aβ-pathology, with 13 years of follow-up.",f7d9a7a0-039e-41ae-909c-128e807d9f60
28,discussion5," However, 1 review, including 7 RCTs, 7 cross-sectional studies, and 1 longitudinal study on diet and biomarkers of AD, concludes that adherence to Mediterranean diet and reduction of AD biomarkers, as well as high-glycemic and high saturated fat diet, were all associated with an increase in biomarker levels of AD.34 A study showed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with better cognitive performance in midlife.35 However, we emphasize using dementia diagnoses as outcome is the most clinically relevant.  Considering that no systematic cognitive testing was available during follow-up (only available in medical records for those undergoing dementia workups according to routine clinical practice), and that the reviewed dementia diagnoses were retrieved from the National Patient Register (NPR), there could be an underestimation of the number of dementia cases.",8d9c8de6-f235-4efa-83a0-e6447bf72cdd
29,discussion6," The advantage, however, is that all surviving participants were under risk for dementia during the study period and only those completing follow-up visits. Note also that to improve the quality of the dementia diagnoses, fulfillment of diagnostic criteria was validated retrospectively by trained physicians at the memory clinic. Dietary data were only collected at baseline, and there is a risk of alterations in dietary habits during follow-up. This was however somewhat accounted for by excluding participants who reported a substantial alteration in dietary habits at any time before baseline in sensitivity analysis, with the same results as in the main analyses. Although participants were followed for a median period of 19.8 years, we cannot rule out that even longer follow-up might have resulted in a slightly different result.",9ef59e96-32d4-44f8-b53e-b0e671b9672e
30,discussion7," Using vegetable oils instead of olive oil could be a limitation of the mMDS; however, the vegetable oils in the mMDS are all of vegetable origin, with a high proportion of monosaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, participants with CSF samples were not randomized but recruited based on clinical indications, which is a limitation of this study. Although multiple baseline characteristics were adjusted for, additional possible confounding factors cannot be ruled out, such as health selection bias. Randomized controlled trials are needed to provide additional evidence regarding the potential role of diet in relation to AD pathology. However, it is probably not feasible to design a 20-year randomized controlled trial with strict dietary habits to adhere to.",4d89e35b-6393-449d-93f0-88f5c5b5f638
31,discussion8,"  Adherence to conventional dietary recommendations or to a modified Mediterranean diet during midlife were not associated with a lower incidence in all-cause dementia over a 20-year period, nor was the diet associated with AD dementia, accumulation of Aβ pathology, or to VaD.
