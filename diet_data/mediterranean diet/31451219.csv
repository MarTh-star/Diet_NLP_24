0,introduction0,"Cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) are currently the leading cause of death in the world with more people dying every year from a pathology related to cardiovascular health than from any other cause. The World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) estimated that in 2016, 15.2 million people died from cardiovascular disease (CVD); this represents 27% of all deaths recorded around the world and was the leading cause of death for the past 15 years1. In the United States this rate reached 34%2, while in the European Union, this figure was 40%3.  According to the recent report, Deaths broken down by cause, prepared by the Spanish National Institute of Statistics (Instituto Nacional de estadística (INE) in its Spanish initialism of Instituto Nacional de Estadística), cardiovascular disease (CVD) was below the European average but was still the leading cause of death in Spain, accounting for 28.",c41c73a5-4753-42cf-aa5f-a1b4212021f5
1,introduction1,"8% of all deaths and even exceeding deaths by cancer or respiratory diseases. The Valencian Autonomous Community (VC) placed tenth with respect to all the other communities in Spain, with a gross mortality rate of 274 per 100,000 inhabitants4.  The European Union (EU) Science Centre reported that production losses due to mortality and morbidity associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD)s cost the EU 54 billion euros in 2015 and the total cost of providing health care (including medical care, medications, and lost productivity) to people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) was 45 billion euros5, Spain accounted for 2% of that cost6. By 2020, this figure is expected to reach 122.6 billion euros in Spain and approximately 178.9 billion euros in the United States7.  The factors that influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be grouped into genetic and biological factors (e.g.",5eedb85c-1ebe-4ed1-a3e4-70283a431f4f
2,introduction2,", hypertension, dyslipidaemia, or diabetes) whose negative influence is modulated by behavioural factors such as diet, physical activity, and toxic habits (e.g., tobacco or alcohol use), which in turn depend on structural factors including socioeconomic and education levels and characteristics of society itself8. In addition to inducing cardiovascular disease (CVD), these risk factors are causally related to other non-communicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease9.  Arterial hypertension (arterial hypertension (AHT)) is one of the arteriosclerotic disease risk factors that can be modified from an early age. In children and adolescents, it remains a major problem and is a prominent public health concern. The latest epidemiological studies reveal that the prevalence of paediatric arterial hypertension (AHT) varies from 3% in the general population to 25% in obese children10.",4c2b8c24-f2f1-4805-8ae4-6af86cbfb762
3,introduction3," Previous studies have shown that high blood pressure (high blood pressure (HBP)) in childhood is the strongest predictor of arterial hypertension (AHT) in adults11. A cut-off age of 16 years is established by the European Societies of Hypertension Guides for the management of arterial hypertension (AHT) in children and adolescents (prepared in 2016 based on that of 2009), after which the reference figures for diagnosis in adults are followed12.  The prevalence of hypertension in childhood increases with obesity which itself is a potential problem because obesity is associated with the appearance of comorbidities in childhood and its persistence into adulthood increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)13. The Aladino Study conducted in Spain in 201514 indicated that, based on World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards, 23.2% of Spanish adolescents were overweight (22.4% male and 23.9% female) and the prevalence of obesity was 18.1% (20.4% male and 15.8% female).",462d80fe-13f2-401e-b351-ad677bd0a080
4,introduction4,"  In addition, it has been shown that during childhood and adolescence, waist circumference (WC) significantly correlates with the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and percentage of body fat. WC is considered a good indicator of obesity in children and adolescents but is age and sex dependent and so is expressed as corresponding percentiles. In contrast, the ratio between the WC and height, also called the waist-to-height ratio (WtHR), remains stable during growth and so does not need to be compared with age percentiles15. WtHR has a uniform behaviour in correlation with age, against the increasing linear behaviour of the body mass index (BMI), which it is also has a simpler mathematical calculation16. The habit of eating breakfast also appears to be related to preventing obesity because adolescents who regularly consume breakfast have a lower body fat content17.",63544ab0-f140-44d8-9225-31160cc6cadd
5,introduction5,"  Moreover, adolescents are increasingly using new technologies as their main form of communication and as a source of social and academic support. Many hours can be spent using such devices even though they have been associated with poor sleep18 and a considerable increase in physical inactivity19. Furthermore, despite their known association with venous and arterial thrombi20 and direct relationship with high blood pressure (HBP) over time21, the use of contraceptives (either to prevent pregnancy or to improve dysmenorrhea or menorrhagia22) has become increasingly common among adolescent girls.  Adolescence is a stage of considerable risks which can be determined by the social environment23. Thus, it is important to try to influence risk factors such as adherence to a healthy diet, physical activity, tobacco and alcohol consumption at this stage because these are much harder to modify during adulthood.",d286740c-ecf9-4ed4-bbb2-2848335b0d0c
6,introduction6," In this present study we aimed to determine which of these modifiable risk factors should be targeted from early ages.  Our main objective was to estimate the prevalence of high blood pressure (HBP) in adolescents from the VC, and to investigate its association in this population with other risk factors related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and arterial hypertension (AHT) such as obesity and its possible causes including diet quality, physical inactivity, exposure to sedentary habits. We used these data to create an adjusted model to estimate the probability of adolescents suffering from high blood pressure (HBP) based on the factors that most strongly influenced this outcome.

Logistical model To estimate the probability of presenting high blood pressure (HBP), we used sex and WtHR as covariates to adjust a logistical model (as summarised in Table 3). These covariates represent two characteristics on the profile of young people. The variable sex is a qualitative characteristic, not modifiable; whose reference category in the model is Female. The WtHR variable is a quantitative, modifiable characteristic.

This is because these adolescents do not often go to their family doctor and when they do, their blood pressure is not usually measured. Therefore, the problem of high blood pressure (HBP) generally goes unnoticed in adolescents and this can increase their risk of developing arterial hypertension (AHT) in adulthood31.  This current research indicates that some 13.8% to 15.9% of adolescents have high blood pressure (HBP). These figures agree with those published by the American guide for the management of arterial hypertension (AHT) in children and adolescents (15–19% for boys and 7–12% for girls)2, although their data significantly differed by race. Similarly, our figures may be subject to variation because of differences in the methods used to measure blood pressure, ethnicities, and cultural and nutritional differences.",8c1eed52-de30-4b76-8fdc-9056d9ea77c0
33,discussion1," Some of these differences could also be accounted for by our use of the new American Academy of Paediatrics classification criteria published in 201732,33.  In addition, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are sexually dysmorphic: the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) is significantly higher in boys than in girls while the mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is significantly higher in girls than in boys12. Our results also followed this pattern: a high systolic blood pressure (SBP) profile was more common in male adolescents than in females (15.3% vs. 4.4%, respectively) but, on the contrary, a high diastolic blood pressure (DBP) profile was more common among adolescent females than males (3.1% vs. 2.1%, respectively). In addition, in agreement with the published literature34, significantly more adolescent males had high blood pressure (HBP) compared to female adolescents.",013f882b-033c-43bf-9818-ff015d7806b8
34,discussion2,"  At around 14–15 years, the provision of paediatric medical care usually changes over to that of general medicine. Moreover, the criteria for classifying high blood pressure (HBP) also change from percentiles to absolute values after 15 years of age. Thus, perhaps this change in criteria, together with the hormonal changes experienced by adolescents at around this age, can explain why significantly more adolescents are diagnosed with high blood pressure (HBP) from this age12.  Even though a link between arterial hypertension (AHT) in adulthood and a hereditary genetic component is well established in the scientific literature, we found no relationship between high blood pressure (HBP) during adolescence and a family clinical history of arterial hypertension (AHT). Perhaps, although patients with a family history of arterial hypertension (AHT) have a higher risk of suffering from high blood pressure (HBP), this problem may not have yet manifested in adolescents35.",80d3ef9e-c38b-4c05-99a5-e20c7c532b45
35,discussion3,"  In agreement with other studies36, our results indicate that high blood pressure (HBP) is associated with being overweight according to both the WtHR and body mass index (BMI) criteria. One meta-analysis found a moderate, positive correlation between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and body mass index (BMI) and WC, as well as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 4.4 mmHg and 3.6 mmHg, respectively, in association with a weight loss of 5.1 kg. Therefore, it seems that reducing body weight to a body mass index (BMI) of < 25 is important in the control of blood pressure37,38.  Recommendations of the Spanish Society for the Study of Obesity (Study of Obesity (SEEDO)) have been followed of WC measurement method, above the upper edge of iliac crests (at the level of the navel)39.",4f750fa3-fe68-4004-9026-0fd2f9c9e77d
36,discussion4," In contrast to many countries, WC normative systems based on World Health Organization (WHO)/International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommendations (midway between the lowest ribs and the iliac crest) have been developed40.  Another finding that was compatible with other studies41, was the 12.7% discrepancy in the classification of overweight and normal weight individuals when they were classified using categorised WtHR versus categorised body mass index (BMI). This difference may be because body mass index (BMI) considers the association between height and weight but not the bodily distribution of that weight, meaning that a very heavy athletic body with a narrow WC would tend to be classified as overweight by the body mass index (BMI) but as normal weight by the WtHR. Conversely, a person with a very pronounced and full WC would likely be categorised as overweight by the WtHR but, depending on their height and sex, may be categorised as normal weight by the body mass index (BMI).",c5e07e3b-ccc9-41b8-9591-d338b01a6871
37,discussion5," Nonetheless, it was more useful to study the WtHR to assess high blood pressure (HBP) in this current study.  In contrast to recently published results recommending the Mediterranean diet as a means to achieve a normal weight and avoid high blood pressure (HBP)38, we found no significant association between high blood pressure (HBP) and adherence to this diet, as measured using the KIDMED index. This discrepancy may be because some degree of maturity is required to answer some questions on the KIDMED index, and so we cannot be sure that this questionnaire is appropriate for the youngest participants among our cohort. In a study similar to ours that found a relationship between diet and high blood pressure (HBP) among younger children, the dietary survey was completed by participants’ guardians36.",9d52bd1e-9722-4ddd-a656-32631714fb8c
38,discussion6," However, another study found no relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and protection from high blood pressure (HBP), although this relationship did become significant when the child’s hand grip strength was also taken into account42.  Regarding diet, it is important to separately consider the daily habit of eating breakfast. As we also report in this current research, the Helena study17 conducted in Europe found that a breakfast-eating habit was related to the lowest body fat percentage and healthiest cardiovascular risk profiles. Likewise, the work carried out by the International Breakfast Research Initiative (International Breakfast Research Initiative (IBRI)) in Europe and North America, also established the importance of eating breakfast by analysing national and regional food-consumption databases to gain a clearer picture of food and nutrient intake at breakfast43,44.",26d33e4e-9bf6-4cba-a19c-8de24fac29dc
39,discussion7,"  Although smoking is associated with the development of high blood pressure (HBP) in patients aged over 35 years45, our research found no evidence for this association among adolescents. This result is consistent with that obtained in a meta-analysis of 29 studies, which included 192,067 children, and adolescents, which concluded that neither active tobacco consumption nor passive exposure to it were associated with the development of arterial hypertension (AHT)46.  The alcohol consumption figures we obtained in this study (29.6%) were similar to those from other studies carried out in Spanish adolescents (28.3%)47. We did not find an association between this habit and high blood pressure (HBP), however, it is likely that studies with a longitudinal rather than a transversal statistical design will be required to detect any such associations.",7e6056c3-6d7c-46bc-940e-7353a5f37ba2
40,discussion8," Nonetheless, there is no doubt that both these toxic habits are harmful, even though it is unlikely that their harmful effects will have yet manifested at such early ages.  Adolescents now spend increasing amounts of time watching television and using other screened devices such as personal computers, videogames consoles, or smartphones. We found that the daily television viewing time was not directly associated with high blood pressure (HBP) but was higher among overweight adolescents and so this factor was associated with WtHR. However, the time adolescents spent daily using videogames consoles and personal computers was associated both with being overweight and with high blood pressure (HBP). Conversely, smartphone use was inversely associated with the same outcomes.  These use habits also evolved with age: younger adolescents watched television and used smartphones for longer, and their use of videogames consoles tended to be replaced by personal computer use, as they got older.",d9ff8ad6-c23c-4aa8-91de-7d273eecb9a5
41,discussion9," Another study found that the time spent watching television or screened devices was indirectly associated with high blood pressure (HBP) via other risk factors such as obesity, sugary drinks consumption, and inadequate sleep48. Conversely, other authors found a direct association between the times spent using such devices and high blood pressure (HBP) and other parameters that have potentially harmful effects on health49.  Limits As a self-evaluated survey by young people, it has been difficult for us to consult on some demographic factors such as income, depression, etc. Therefore, these variables have not been investigated. Another limitation is that a proportional sample of adolescents was not obtained in the three provinces but can be considered representative of the accessible population given the sample size achieved.  Conclusions high blood pressure (HBP) is a complex health problem that affects 13.8% to 15.9% of adolescents aged between 11 and 18 years.",cb3faa09-ed74-4bea-b3be-f5c8889d924b
42,discussion10," Compared to their female counterparts, it was twice as prevalent among male adolescents, and was present in 27% of the overweight participants (according to WtHR criteria) in our study. The adjusted logistical model we created allowed us to estimate the probability of high blood pressure (HBP) based on two covariates.  Some risk factors associated with arterial hypertension (AHT) in adults did not statistically correlate with high blood pressure (HBP) in adolescents, including a family history of arterial hypertension (AHT), low physical activity levels, or not following a Mediterranean diet. In addition, some factors were not associated with high blood pressure (HBP) but did correlate with WtHR; these included a daily habit of eating breakfast and habits consistent with a sedentary lifestyle such as watching television for long periods, and excessive use of videogames consoles, personal computers, and smartphones.",2a91f4fa-c46b-47b9-bd52-868f8034bd49
43,discussion11," Adequate control of these factors, combined with a healthy lifestyle, could contribute to reducing WtHR and indirectly prevent the appearance of high blood pressure (HBP).
