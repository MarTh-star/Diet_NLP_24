Design and Setting  In this monocentric study, participants were enlisted from December 2011 to February 2021 at the Obesity Unit (C.I.B.O. and EASO center) at the Unit of Endocrinology, Clinical Medicine and Surgery Department, University “Federico II” of Naples. Some of the participants were also recruited during the OPERA prevention project [32]. This research was approved by Ethical Committee Federico II (n. 239/11) and was conducted following the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for human studies. All subjects were informed about the study design and purpose and gave informed consent.  2.2. Population Study  A total of 1855 adult participants, 680 males and 1175 females, aged 18–59 years, with body mass index (BMI)s ranging from 19.5 to 69.4 kg/m2, and only Caucasian individuals, were enrolled in this study.",e27ca90c-d6cd-4140-a27c-eee159dc219c

All female participants were non-lactating and non-pregnant. Females of childbearing age were evaluated only in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Full medical information, such as a drug use, was collected from all subjects enrolled in this study. The exclusion criteria included:  Patients with the following diseases: type 1 and type 2 diabetes, cancer, anxiety or depression, diagnosed anemia, or any other metabolic diseases requiring a special nutritional approach. We also excluded individuals with hepatic or renal insufficiency, chronic inflammatory diseases, alcohol abuse, or on pharmacological therapy that could influence body weight;  Occasional or current use of any of the medications that could influence fluid balance, or carbohydrate or lipid metabolism, e.g.",c91b741f-e050-4936-b950-706a8acd0de4

Physical Activity and Smoking Habits  Through the administration of a standard questionnaire, as already reported in other studies [33,34], physical activity levels and cigarette smoking habits were assessed in all participants. Participants were classified into inactive or active subjects, based on the minutes of daily physical activity performed. In particular, those who practiced at least 30 min of daily aerobic physical activity were classified as active.  Similarly, the participants were divided into current smokers (when smoking at least one cigarette per day) or non-current smokers, those who do not smoke any cigarettes a day, as we reported earlier [35,36].  2.4.",394c0b5b-bcd3-41a9-9ed7-a25413115b95
4,methods4," Anthropometric Measurements  Anthropometric measurements and assessment were done in all participants between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., after an overnight fast. For weight and height measurement, a calibrated balance beam scale was used to the nearest 50 g (Seca 711; Seca, Hamburg, Germany) and a wall-mounted stadiometer to the nearest 1 cm. All participants wore light clothing and were without shoes when measuring. As previously reported [37,38,39] and in accordance with the WHO’s criteria [40], body mass index (BMI) was calculated by weight (kg) and height squared (m2). Participants were classified into five body mass index (BMI) classes: normal weight, overweight, grade I obesity, grade II obesity, and grade III obesity (body mass index (BMI): 18.5–24.9 kg/m2, 25.0–29.9 kg/m2, 30.0–34.9 kg/m2, 35.0–39.9 kg/m2, and ≥40.0 kg/m2, respectively).

5,methods5," In patients with grade III obesity, or in subjects where no narrowest point of the waist was visible, WC was taken using a non-stretchable measuring tape to the nearest 0.1 cm at umbilical level [41].  2.5. Inflammatory Marker  In the morning (8.00–10.00 a.m.), and after an overnight fast of at least 8 h, the blood samples were collected and subsequently stored at −80 °C until processed.  Serum high-sensitivity (hs) C reactive protein (CRP) levels were analyzed by CardioPhase® (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany), based on particle-enhanced immunonephelometry. The coefficient of variation (CV) of intra- and interassay was <7%.  2.6. Nutritional Parameters  As we reported earlier [42,43,44], the adherence to the MD was assessed by the PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED)) questionnaire, a previously validated 14-item questionnaire [45].",d92633fb-70f5-47b1-b502-aaadc97d7cd9
6,methods6," The PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) questionnaire was performed by a certified clinical nutrition specialist with 5 years of experience through a face-to-face interview with all the enrolled individuals. Scores of one (Yes) and zero (No), were assigned for each of the 14 items of the PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) questionnaire. The PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score was calculated from the sum of the scores of the 14 questions of the PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) questionnaire. In accordance with the PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score, we divided the participants into three categories of adherence to the MD as follows: highest adherence, average adherence, and lowest adherence to the MD (PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score ≥ 10, 6–9, and 0–5, respectively) [45].  2.7.",0818a88a-8494-4a57-99a4-326175f281eb
7,methods7," Body Composition and PhA  As previously reported [46,47,48,49], and according to the ESPEN [13], the same certified clinical nutrition specialist with 5 years of experience in the assessment of body composition performed body composition measurements using a Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) phase-sensitive system (Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) 101, RJL Akern Bioresearch, Florence, Italy, 800 µA current at a single frequency of 50 kHz) [50]. The Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) exam was performed by the same device to avoid interdevice and interobserver variability. Before applying the electrodes, subjects were asked to remove their shoes and socks (Bioimpedance analysis (BIA)TRODES Akern Srl; Florence—Italy). According to Kushner [51], the contact areas of electrodes on the hand and the ipsilateral foot, were scrubbed with alcohol immediately before their placement.  PhA (°, degrees) was obtained by the formula: Xc/R*(180/π).",e306f526-40c6-42ef-ab26-d7654a8da47a

A partial correlation was performed to control for effects of confounding factors on PhA including age, sex, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), WC, and PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score. A proportional odds ratio (OR) model, p-value, 95% confidence interval (CI), and R2 were used to assess the association between PhA with categorical variables included in this study (sex, smoking, physical activity, body mass index (BMI) classes, and PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) categories).",39982dd0-bef2-418c-9fa2-292bf160d8be

Finally, two receiver operator characteristic (receiver operator characteristic (ROC)) curve analyses were performed to determine the area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)), criterion, sensitivity and specificity, standard error, and 95% CI as well as cut-off values for PhA (°) predictive of hs-C reactive protein (CRP) levels above the median value (2.33 ng/mL and 1.90 ng/mL, in males and females, respectively).  3. Results  The study population consisted of 1855 individuals, 680 males (36.7%) and 1175 females (63.3%), aged 18–59 years, with body mass index (BMI)s ranging from 19.5 to 69.4 kg/m2.",278f4800-4cbb-41ba-9d40-941fe5eb788a
12,methods12," There were 1191 physically active subject (64.2%), while there were 484 current smokers (26.1%). Regarding body mass index (BMI) classes, the most common was grade III obesity (518 subjects, 27.9%). In addition, based on PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) categories, the majority of participants had a low–average adherence to the MD (39.0% and 38.7%, respectively), while only 22.3% of the study population reported a high adherence to the MD.  The descriptive characteristics, including age, lifestyle, anthropometric measurements, inflammatory marker, and nutritional and body composition parameters of the study population according to sex, are given in Table 1. In particular, there were no obvious sex differences in age and physical activity levels (p = 0.511 and p = 0.071, respectively). In addition, more of the female participants were non-smoking (p < 0.001) and presented grade III obesity (p < 0.001), despite a higher percentage of adherence to the MD (p < 0.",91039b02-dea5-45b1-bf69-9b401b08c1b8

Females showed also lower hs-C reactive protein (CRP) levels (p = 0.003), lower Xc and PhA values, and higher R than males (Xc and PhA: p < 0.001, and R: p = 0.022).  PhA, according to smoking, physical activity, body mass index (BMI) classes, and PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) categories, is showed in Table 2. PhA was significantly higher among physically active individuals (p < 0.001), in overweight subjects (p < 0.001), and in subjects with a high adherence to the MD (p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was evident between smokers and non-smokers (p = 0.106).  Correlation Analysis  The correlations between PhA and age, anthropometric measurements, inflammatory marker, and nutritional and body composition parameters are summarized in Table 3. All parameters evaluated in this study were significantly associated with PhA.",20585c5a-4fad-44a4-b048-38382ccff8c1
14,methods14,"  When dividing the population according to sex, PhA was inversely associated with hs-C reactive protein (CRP) levels (r = −0.609, p < 0.001 and r = −0.614, p < 0.001 in males and females, respectively). Of interest, after adjusting for age, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), WC, and PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score, the correlation between PhA and hs-C reactive protein (CRP) levels was still evident in males (r = −0.424, p < 0.001) and females (r = −0.411, p < 0.001), as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.  Table 4 reports the results of a bivariate proportional OR model performed to assess the association between PhA and categorical variables included in this study. PhA was significantly associated with all categorical variables (p < 0.001), except smoking (OR 0.90, p = 0.106). In particular, the highest PhA values were associated with males (OR 0.90, p = 0.106), physically active subjects (OR 1.63, p < 0.001), the overweight classes (OR 6.",0d04415a-8a0f-4911-bb45-a274ec3385b2
15,methods15,"66, p < 0.001), and the highest adherence to the MD (OR 3.26, p < 0.001) (Table 4).  To compare the relative predictive power of age, sex, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), WC, hs-C reactive protein (CRP) level, and PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score associated with the PhA values, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis using a model that included these variables. Using this model, PREvention with MEDiterranean Diet (PREDIMED) score was entered at the first step, followed by sex, hs-C reactive protein (CRP) levels, body mass index (BMI), and age (p < 0.001 for all), while physical activity and WC were excluded. The results are reported in Table 5.  Two receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were then performed to determine the cut-off values of PhA according to the sex prediction of hs-C reactive protein (CRP) levels. In particular, in males, PhA ≤ 5.5° (p < 0.001, area under the curve (AUC) 0.811, standard error 0.016, 95% CI 0.779 to 0.",2e1600ac-9974-443e-bbf4-d14292e186e4
16,methods16,"842; Figure 3), and in females, PhA ≤ 5.4° (p < 0.001, area under the curve (AUC) 0.850, standard error 0.013, 95% CI 0.825 to 0.874; Figure 4), could serve as thresholds for significantly increased hs-C reactive protein (CRP) levels below the median values (2.33 ng/mL and 1.90 ng/mL, in males and females, respectively).  4. Discussion  The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether there was a sex difference in the association between PhA values and C reactive protein (CRP) levels in a large sample of the adult population. Although PhA was lower among females than males, male participants exhibited an unhealthy lifestyle, characterized by higher prevalence of smoking habits, higher WC measurements, and lower adherence to the MD, which was associated with higher C reactive protein (CRP) levels compared to the female counterparts.",d720b02e-9d1b-46ce-90c2-b5cbf44168fc
17,methods17," However, in both sexes, smaller PhA was associated with higher C reactive protein (CRP) levels, and this inverse association was also independent of other common confounding variables, such as age, physical activity, anthropometric measurements, and adherence to the MD. These findings indicated that in our adult population sample, PhA might represent a more reliable predictor of meta-inflammation than other common anthropometric measurements, such as body mass index (BMI) and WC. Based on the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we found that ≤5.5° in males and ≤5.4° in females were the cut-offs for the PhA to predict the highest C reactive protein (CRP) levels. To the best of our knowledge, to date, this is the first study assessing the association of PhA with a validated marker of inflammation, such as C reactive protein (CRP), in a large sample of the adult population according to sex.",350a5d03-ed2d-4f4a-b573-49de5005de97
18,methods18,"  While the validity of C reactive protein (CRP) as a biomarker of meta-inflammation is well established, to date, the biological significance of PhA in meta-inflammation has yet to be clarified. Of interest, both PhA and C reactive protein (CRP) are influenced by age, body mass index (BMI), and nutritional status, and exhibited a clear sex dimorphism. However, the influence of sex on the association between these variables, which are both linked to the meta-inflammation, has not yet been investigated.  PhA is a raw parameter derived from two direct values of the Bioimpedance analysis (BIA), R and Xc, and it has been extensively used as an indicator of inflammatory status and cell membrane function, as well as a marker of nutritional status and dietary intake in different population studies [9,11,52,53]. In a healthy population, gender, age, and body weight are the major predictors of PhA [11,16].",02f59b2d-0c5a-464f-a4f2-50ede7da95c7
19,methods19," Due to lower fat mass and higher muscle mass percentage, PhA is known to be higher in healthy males in comparison to females. Very recently, PhA has been proposed as a useful marker of inflammation and altered hydration status in patients affected with COVID-19 [54]. In detail, Cornejo-Pareja et al. reported that low PhA was a significant predictor of mortality risk in COVID-19, independent of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities, suggesting that PhA assessment should be included in the routine clinical assessment of COVID-19 patients at increased mortality risk [54].  In addition, large epidemiological studies reported that there is a clear sex dimorphism in C reactive protein (CRP) levels [6,7,8]. Changes in PhA and C reactive protein (CRP) also depend on age, as PhA decreases and C reactive protein (CRP) levels increase with advancing age [15].",a608a96d-52b5-4948-9a89-1e0df2818b4f
20,methods20," In fact, it has been consistently reported that the aging process is accompanied by meta-inflammation, characterized by a high level of circulating inflammatory biomarkers, particularly C reactive protein (CRP), which promotes cellular damage and cardiovascular risk [55,56]. On the other hand, body mass index (BMI) variably affected the functional status of cell membranes, for both fat and muscle mass. For these reasons, there is a biphasic association of PhA with age and body mass index (BMI). In particular, there are an inverse correlation with older age and obesity classes and a positive correlation with younger and normal weight/overweight subjects [57,58]. In line with other authors [57,59,60,61,62], in our population sample, PhA and C reactive protein (CRP) levels had a significant and opposite association with age.",a9a5e377-0f4d-401f-8b01-bf6cbf9eb3e9
21,methods21,"  As an adjunctive finding, among the confounding variables possibly affecting the association between PhA and C reactive protein (CRP), we also included adherence to the MD, a healthy, anti-inflammatory dietary pattern known to actively modulate cell membrane properties [17,63]. The ESPEN strongly recommended PhA as a prognostic nutritional measure [64,65], and reliable marker for the identification of inflammation in subjects at risk of impaired nutritional status [11,66,67]. In this context, we have previously shown that in both sexes, a higher adherence to the MD was associated with larger PhA, uncovering a new benefit of the MD for PhA as a marker of inflammation and cell membrane integrity [17]. In the present study, we further provided evidence on the positive association between PhA and adherence to the MD, which was also the major determinant of the PhA values.",866d6651-eb1f-495a-b068-0bc9c0ad1580
22,methods22,"  Several pieces of evidence support a role for PhA as a screening tool for the identification of inflammation in patients with a number of disease conditions, including obesity [19], polycystic ovary syndrome [20], hypovitaminosis D [21], hidradenitis suppurativa [22], psoriasis [23], cancer [24,25], and type 2 diabetes [26]. The inverse association shown between PhA and C reactive protein (CRP) levels can be explained by the fact that although the inflammatory processes are the first line of defense against invading pathogenic microorganisms and a crucial process for the repair of tissue injury, an exaggerated or unregulated prolonged inflammatory process can induce tissue damage [5,68]. In particular, it is well established that C reactive protein (CRP), as an acute marker of inflammation, is deposited at sites of inflammation and tissue damage [5,69].",0fd806f2-5b26-4280-b9ad-8551e18f5a11
23,methods23," Our results are in agreement with previous evidence that showed the association of PhA with inflammatory biomarkers in several diseases [18,30,70,71]. In particular, Stobäus et al., in 777 (aged > 18 years) hospitalized patients in a retrospective analysis, reported that C reactive protein (CRP) levels exhibited a significant influence on PhA and concluded that next to the established predictors, such as gender, age, and body weight, inflammation in sick individuals also strongly affected PhA values [18]. Subsequently, Tomeleri et al. examined the association of PhA with inflammatory biomarkers in 155 older women, with body mass index (BMI)s varying from normal weight to grade I obesity [30]. The authors reported that, after controlling for potential covariates, such as age and number of diseases, PhA exhibited a negative association with all inflammatory biomarkers, particularly C reactive protein (CRP) [30].",51fa8899-8955-4a37-b350-2b5dfa2c833f
24,methods24," The results of these two studies corroborate the findings of our two previous studies [23,31]. In the first study, conducted in 180 adult patients with psoriasis, an inflammatory skin disease that is associated with increased C reactive protein (CRP) levels, we reported the first evidence that psoriatic patients presented lower PhAs compared to controls, with a novel negative association between PhA and C reactive protein (CRP) levels independent of body mass index (BMI) [23]. More recently, we also confirmed the negative association between PhA and C reactive protein (CRP) after adjustment for sex, body mass index (BMI), and WC in patients with Prader–Willi syndrome, which is associated with a high prevalence of metabolic dysfunction and meta-inflammation [31].",08a4589a-5b86-43c2-aa26-28f0ac01f689
25,methods25," Given the obsessive–compulsive characteristics of this syndrome, which are commonly associated with poor compliance with blood sampling, the usefulness of PhA as a non-invasive marker of inflammation was strongly suggested in these patients.  The findings of the present study lend further support to the association between PhA and C reactive protein (CRP) and suggested a novel use of PhA as an alternative marker of meta-inflammation. This finding could be of particular interest when considering that monitoring C reactive protein (CRP) involves invasive collection of blood samples and expensive biochemical assays, which may limit its use in clinical practice. In addition, this study extends the knowledge on the association between PhA and C reactive protein (CRP) by demonstrating that this association was independent of sex, as suggested by the substantial similarity of the cut-off values to predict the C reactive protein (CRP) levels in both male and female participants.",69622847-f38d-4ed0-9a42-ccdd6dbcbd0b
26,methods26,"  Limitations and Strengths of This Study  Firstly, the cross-sectional design of the study does not allow us to identify causality in the relationship between PhA and C reactive protein (CRP), thus limiting the external validity in other populations. However, considering the independence of the common confounding variables included in this study, our data suggested that this inverse association might still be generalized, to some extent, to other populations. Second, we did not analyze other inflammatory markers. However, it is widely accepted that C reactive protein (CRP) represents the most studied inflammatory biomarker in relation to a variety of pathologic processes [4]. Therefore, we used an hs-C reactive protein (CRP) method, which allows an acceptable precision level of <0.3 mg/L in detecting gender differences in C reactive protein (CRP) median values.",14547335-2317-4e8c-b01a-a81da10cd42c
27,methods27," Third, the proposed sex cut-off point of PhA for identifying the highest C reactive protein (CRP) levels should be validated by further clinical trials. A major point of strength of this study is the actual sample size of our population, which also shared the same geographical area and the same food availability. This allowed us to improve the homogeneity of the study sample. Another major strong point is the adjustment with a number of covariates commonly affecting PhA and C reactive protein (CRP), including sex and adherence to the MD. In addition, to minimize the interoperator variability, only one clinical nutritionist performed and interpreted the Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) measurements, and the PhA values were obtained using the same Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) instrument. In fact, it should be mentioned that differences in PhA values obtained from Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) single frequency vs.",e07a6f39-0231-4677-a54a-4e98ffaddce0
28,methods28," Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) multifrequency instruments from different manufacturers have been observed [29]. Finally, considering that, according to the indications reported in ESPEN guidelines, the use of Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) in clinical practice is not indicated for routine assessment in patients with an unbalanced state of hydration and underweight subjects (body mass index (BMI) < 19 kg/m2) or those with grade III obesity (body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m2) [13], in the present study, we chose to evaluate the PhA as the most clinically relevant and direct impedance measure of Bioimpedance analysis (BIA), which is not influenced by altered hydration in the algorithmic computations to assess free fat mass, body cellular mass, and other body composition compartments, or by height and weight [72,73].  5.",81bbc144-6070-4650-8edf-228ff21a4639
29,methods29," Conclusions  This was the first report showing that in a large population of adult subjects of both sexes, the negative association between PhA and C reactive protein (CRP) levels was independent of covariates commonly affecting PhA and C reactive protein (CRP), including sex and adherence to the MD. As possible translational applications, these findings further support that PhA may be an easy and reliable measure to detect meta-inflammation, which could avoid blood sampling and expensive biochemical assays.
