0,methods0," 2.1. Study Participants  The test group (MI The test group (MIG)) consisted of male patients who had a first episode of MI in the previous 48 h who attended the University Hospital, Sevilla, from February 2017 to February 2019. During the same period, the control group (CG) was recruited from male patients attending at the School of Dentistry of the University of Seville without a history of MI. Both groups were asked to participate in the study and signed an informed consent form. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the same hospital (1588-N-20, 21 December 2016). Both groups were divided into two other groups according to the presence or absence of Periodontitis (PER). Periodontitis (PER) were diagnosed according to the stage III and IV definition of the 2017 World Workshop on Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Condition [19]: clinical attachment level ≥ 5 mm at 2 ≥ sites in ≥ 2 non-adjacent teeth.",c17f8c34-5d35-464f-831a-442797493461
1,methods1," Severe Periodontitis (PER) was defined as 30% tooth with probing depth ≥ 4 at 2 ≥ interproximal sites. Furthermore, the number of sites with a clinical attachment level ≥ 5 mm and the number of teeth were recorded. MI The test group (MIG) was followed for at least two years.  The sample size was obtained considering the combination of two dichotomous variables: cardiovascular (yes/no) and Periodontitis (PER) (yes/no) and with the means of data for the clinical attachment level (clinical attachment level (CAL)) (0.01, 0.27 and 0.07) and the main quantitative variables of the groups (0.4). A minimum sample size of 43 patients was obtained when the values were established at 5% and the power at 90% (for factor A: Cardiovascular disease (CVD)) and 99% (for factor B: Periodontitis (PER)) and for interaction.  2.2. Clinical Data  General data were recorded: age, height, weight, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), abdominal waist circumference and smoking status.",7d06ac48-f75d-4367-91fe-9a56fd31f46f
2,methods2," We consider a smoker as someone who smoked at least one cigarette per day and nonsmokers as those who do not currently smoke.  2.3. Dietary Assessment  The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MDA)) [20] was used. It consists of 12 questions on frequency of food consumption and 2 questions on food intake habits considered characteristic of the Spanish Mediterranean diet. Each question was scored 0 or 1. The final MAD score ranged from 0 to 14 and was classified as Very low (range), Low, High and Very high.  2.4. Physical Activity  Based on Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity [21], we asked for the hours spent on walking, any sport, household activity and other physical activity per week and obtained the average weekly exercise hours.  2.5.",2fefe226-8dc6-4ecb-80d7-b570a119f80c
3,methods3," Oral Examination  A calibrated explorer (PB) recorded the depth of the probing pocket at six sites per tooth as the distance between the gingival margin and the bottom of the pocket and the level of clinical attachment as the distance between the cemento–enamel junction and the bottom of the pocket. Bleeding on probing was also recorded after 10 s [22] at four sites around each tooth.  2.6. Biochemical Parameters  In CG, venous blood samples were obtained after a fasting period and in MI The test group (MIG) within 48 h after the acute episode in the routine cardiac control. The following biochemical parameters were obtained: fasting glycemia, urea, creatinine, uric acid, GPT, GGT, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, VLDL, total cholesterol/HDL index, albumin, total bilirubin, phosphorus, calcium, HbA1c, TSH, iron, cortisol and CRP for all patients and high sensitivity troponine-1 and alkaline phosphatase for cardiac patients using routine analytical methods.  2.7.",5f47bfd1-05eb-4fd5-93c6-8a62d0de8d16
4,methods4," Microbiological Sample  In each patient, the three deepest periodontal pockets were selected. After the removal of the supragingival plaque and isolation of the area, paper points were inserted into the gingival sulcus for 30 s. The samples were pooled, stored in Eppendorfs and immediately processed. DNA was extracted in 24 h using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and divided into aliquots for the microIDent PCR test (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany). DNA-STRIP technology was used to record the species of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), Treponema denticola (Td), Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), as previously described. For the determination of analytical sensitivity, a series of plasmid dilutions was used containing target sequences detectable with micro-IDent®plus11.",cf224912-9c18-46ab-9412-da8e91f3a7b9
5,methods5," The following detection limits were determined: Aa specie: 50–100 genome equivalents/PCR or 1000–5000 genome equivalents/paper point; all other species: 500–1000 genome equivalents/PCR or 10,000–50,000 genome equivalents/paper point. The results were classified into 5 groups according to bioburden: not detectable (<104, Aa < 103), within the limit (104, Aa 103), increased (<105, Aa < 104), high (<106, Aa < 105) and very high (≥106, Aa ≥ 105).  2.8. Cardiological Parameters  At baseline, the following cardiovascular risk factors were recorded in MI The test group (MIG): Previous history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking and history of ischemic cardiopathy. The left ventricular ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)) was visually estimated by agreement between two observers and categorized into 4 groups: preserved > 50%, slightly reduced 40–49%, moderately reduced 31–40% and severe < 30%.",e19ba47e-ebcc-47a0-baab-05238cddb7b1

Number of coronary vessels affected with severe stenosis, dividing them into ≤two and >three affected vessels. The patients were followed until February 2020, and the following parameters were recorded: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), major adverse cardiac events (Mayor Cardiovascular Adverse Events (MACE)) and death. Mayor Cardiovascular Adverse Events (MACE) is defined as a composite of nonfatal MI nonfatal stroke, repeated revascularization or admission due to a cardiovascular event [23].  2.9. Statistical Analysis  SPSS 25.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analyzes. Descriptive statistics included means, standard deviations, medians, quartiles and percentages. The normal distribution of the quantitative data was verified using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.",f217651f-1fb1-4f59-9fea-19b0562b5095
7,methods7," The statistical ANOVA test for parametric distribution and the Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis tests for the nonparametric distribution were used. The post hoc test utilized for the parametric distribution was Student’s t test with the previous Levine test on the homogeneity of variances, and for nonparametric distribution, the Mann–Whitney U test was used. Categorical variables were analyzed with a chi-square test to determine the groups that make a difference, and the standardized residuals were corrected according to the Haberman method. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between different variables and the risk of MI and Mayor Cardiovascular Adverse Events (MACE) at follow-up. We used logistic regression analysis to model the probability of an event occurring based on other factors. It includes the Backward LR method that considers all confounding variables.",e92ef6fd-8c0f-40ed-b86a-cbed946e5659
8,methods8," It starts from all variables that, in the two-by-two crosses, have shown a relationship with the variable to be estimated; the method is step-by-step exclusion, eliminating in each iteration the variable for which its relationship with the one to be estimated presents less significance until only the most relevant is left.  3. Results  Initially, 138 patients in the CG and 144 in the MI The test group (MIG) were explored, with a later exclusion of 26 patients in CG and 13 patients in MI The test group (MIG) due to missing data. The final sample size for CG was 112 patients (66 with Periodontitis (PER) and 46 without periodontitis (NOPeriodontitis (PER)) and for MI The test group (MIG) 131 patients (85 with Periodontitis (PER) and 46 NOPeriodontitis (PER)) (Figure 1). During MI The test group (MIG) follow-up, one patient died and four patients were lost.  3.1. General Variables  Table 1 shows the general characteristics of the four groups.",5f1e4718-a4c0-43bb-8e55-722d964e456c
9,methods9," The CG patients were older than MI The test group (MIG). No differences in anthropometric variables were observed. The average weekly exercise hours have a high value in CGNOPeriodontitis (PER) compared to the other three groups and also for both CGs compared to MI The test group (MIG). The number of leukocytes was higher in MI The test group (MIG) than in both CG, and the number of monocytes was low in CG compared to MI The test group (MIG). The number of teeth was lower in MI The test group (MIG)Periodontitis (PER). Smoking was high in MI The test group (MIG). Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MDA) shows differences in low adherence and high adherence levels; thus, CG shows a diet closer to Mediterranean parameters than MI The test group (MIG).  The main parameters that define periodontitis show higher values in patients with periodontitis from CG and MI The test group (MIG).",1de57398-b3fd-4ae7-958e-fb10bffa6fd9
10,methods10," Moreover, severe Periodontitis (PER) presents the highest percentages in MI The test group (MIG) (Table 2).  3.2. Biochemical Variables  Differences between CG and MI The test group (MIG) were observed for creatinine, GPT, total cholesterol, HDL, total cholesterol/HDL, albumin, total bilirubin, calcium, TSH and CRP. Cortisol shows the lowest figure in CGNOPeriodontitis (PER) (Table 3).  3.3. Microbiological Variables  The percentages of the different bacteria show statistical differences for Pg and Tf. Lower very high values (≥106, Aa ≥ 105) for Pg and Tf were observed in CGNOPeriodontitis (PER), the other three groups: CGPeriodontitis (PER) and both MI The test group (MIG) showed high values (Table 4).  3.4. Cardiac Data  The analysis of cardiac data in MI The test group (MIG) does not show differences between NOPeriodontitis (PER) and Periodontitis (PER) groups in cardiovascular risk factors (Table 5).",c81972c3-010b-4aba-be86-38a68012a277
11,methods11," Furthermore, when we analyzed cardiac variables of MI, no differences were observed. In follow-up, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) data were better in NOPeriodontitis (PER) (Table 6). Fifteen patients had Mayor Cardiovascular Adverse Events (MACE) (thirteen with Periodontitis (PER) and two without Periodontitis (PER)).  The results of the binary logistic regression (Table 7) show that the variables that show the probability related to MI are as follows: number of sites with clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 5 mm (X1), severe Periodontitis (PER) (X2), average weekly exercise hours (X3), percentage of Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MDA) (X4) and smoker (X5). These are risk factors related to an infarction with a sensitivity of 77.2% and a specificity of 76.1% (cutoff point of predicted probability = 0.5) and according to the following formula: p = 1/(1 + e−(1 + e − (4.484 − 0.033 × X1 − 1.525 × X2 − 0.082 × X3 − 0.047 × X4 + 1.290 × X5)).",359699e0-e9d7-4672-baf6-45b9e98ece02
12,methods12,"  The results of the binary logistic regression (Table 8) show that the variables that can be considered as risk factors for Mayor Cardiovascular Adverse Events (MACE) are the following. Periodontitis (PER) (X1), weight (X2), average weekly exercise hours (X3) and dyslipidemia (X4). These are Mayor Cardiovascular Adverse Events (MACE)-related risk factors with a sensitivity of 72.7% and a specificity of 85.6% (cutoff point of the predicted probability = 0.2) and according to the following formula: p = 1/(1 + e−(3.966 − 3.432 × X1 + −0.091 × X2 + 0.212 × X3 + 1.136 × X4)).  4. Discussion  Our results show that periodontitis is related to MI, as demonstrated in the literature [24,25,26]. Furthermore, another main finding of this study is that periodontitis should be considered as a risk factor in MI follow-up, such as Eppendorf.",a44ee106-5235-46ee-84b2-3ea4f866a128
13,methods13," In MI The test group (MIG), we found no differences in cardiovascular risk factors between periodontitis patients and no periodontitis patients including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and smoking. These risk factors are the most prevalent in some published studies [27,28]. In addition, other risk factors such as waist circumference and HbA1c are not different between the groups. Therefore, our data highlight that patients with those same systemic conditions could have another risk factor, such as Periodontitis (PER). Some authors show that Cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients do not have any of the classic risk factors and 60% of them have not experienced MI [29]. We agree with some authors who propose an inflammatory genetic component in coronary artery disease [30]; our data suggest that one of the infectious diseases that can stimulate the inflammatory statement is periodontitis through oral bacteria.",761d82d6-7c5c-461c-9337-4af18885d5aa
14,methods14,"  The percentages of cardiac variables are not statistically different between MI The test group (MIG)NOPeriodontitis (PER) and MI The test group (MIG)Periodontitis (PER). In the MI The test group (MIG) follow-up, the only variable that had statistical differences between MI The test group (MIG)Periodontitis (PER) and MI The test group (MIG)NOPeriodontitis (PER) is left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is one of the most important parameters for verifying the functional statement of cardiac function, so it is very important for the prognosis of patients with MI to consider all factors that could influence it. The number of Mayor Cardiovascular Adverse Events (MACE) and two types of Mayor Cardiovascular Adverse Events (MACE), non-fatal MI and admission due to CV events, was high in MI The test group (MIG)Periodontitis (PER) but not statistically different.",fde7f77e-a16c-4c87-8c18-f99e68a6f56e
15,methods15," These data reveal a worse recovery after the acute event, which could be explained by more severe periodontal conditions. We must note that MI The test group (MIG)s were followed for at least one year and patients, due to cardiac conditions, were not treated for Periodontitis (PER). We can conclude that Periodontitis (PER) can alter cardiac recovery and influences left ventricular remodeling and future cardiac events.  When we analyzed the results of binary logistic regression, a strong association was observed between average weekly exercise hours, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MDA) and smoking in MI patients. The binary logistic regression analysis shows an association between Periodontitis (PER), weight, average weekly exercise hours, dyslipidemia and Mayor Cardiovascular Adverse Events (MACE). Therefore, the number of teeth and Periodontitis (PER), which indicate unhealthy periodontal conditions, are part of factors that can be related to MI and affect cardiac evolution.",df453e4d-ae4e-459b-ac97-867a528d23c6
16,methods16," Missing teeth is associated with an increased risk of MI and discriminates patients with high cardiovascular risk [31]; low physical activity with an inadequate diet that produces a metabolic syndrome is associated with a high risk of major adverse cardiovascular events [32]. Furthermore, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is essential in cardiac patients’ recovery of cardiac patients [33]; a recent cohort study tried to associate the impact of periodontitis and subgingival bacteria on recurrent Cardiovascular disease (CVD) events such as MI, stroke and death caused by Cardiovascular disease (CVD). The results cannot show an association between the periodontal bacteria that we have studied, although an association between periodontitis and more Cardiovascular disease (CVD) events is shown. [34].  The relationship between MI and Periodontitis (PER) has been extensively studied.",c4b66f2a-f93e-48fd-a84a-ef8ae049424c
17,methods17," A recent meta-analysis of cohort studies indicates that PD is modestly associated with the risk of MI, especially in women [24]. In a 13-year prospective study, severe Periodontitis (PER) was shown to be associated with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease regardless of the established cardiovascular risk factors [35]. A review reports on the proceedings of the workshop jointly organized by the EFP and the World Heart Federation (World Heart Federation (WHF)). They concluded that there is epidemiological evidence for significant associations between periodontitis and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and recommended that dentists, physicians and patients visit dental and medical practices [36].  The general characteristics of the patients show that the most important factor that can distinguish the different conditions is physical activity and a healthy diet and not the anthropometric variables.",d8b22038-742d-4922-98d0-d5c5d716e0ca
18,methods18," We have to consider that we usually have a hypercaloric diet in our countries that results in a specific weight; our results show that the more important factors are the dietary components and their consumption. Various diet indices have shown that unhealthy eating patterns are associated with severe Periodontitis (PER) [37,38] and others are associated only with obese men [39]. Mediterranean components such as salads, fruits and vegetables were associated with a lower level of clinical attachment level [40], and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MDA) produces a significant decrease in the saliva levels of Pg, Pi and Tp [41]. Physical activity has been associated with Periodontitis (PER) in general populations [42,43] and can improve periodontal health in patients with T2 diabetes mellitus [44] and obese women [45]. The Mediterranean diet and moderate physical activity are some of the most important recommendations for the primary prevention of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) [46].",02b20c7e-b3a4-4549-9872-dca91917aa8f
19,methods19," Smoking has been considered a common risk factor for Periodontitis (PER) and cardiovascular disease [47] and we show that the proportion of current smokers was high in MI The test group (MIG). The number of teeth has the lowest value in MI The test group (MIG)Periodontitis (PER), indicating that both conditions have an increasing effect, this result is in agreement with previous data that can discriminate patients with a high risk of MI [31].  We show that the number of leukocytes was high in both MI The test group (MIG)s, as previously reported [48]. An association of leukocyte counts and systemic inflammation was demonstrated in patients with PD [49]. Our data show that the number of monocytes is low in both MI The test group (MIG)s. This could be explained by the margination of monocytes to the coronary vasculature shown in patients after coronary artery reperfusion, which could potentially contribute to the drop in circulating monocytes [50].",76b57878-4ade-45a2-9ede-27fb8599a4c9
20,methods20,"  Some of the biochemical parameters show differences between MI The test group (MIG) and CG as consequences of MI conditions, but they cannot differentiate if they suffer from Periodontitis (PER) or NOPeriodontitis (PER). CRP is the only variable that increases in MI The test group (MIG)Periodontitis (PER) that demonstrates the possible summation effects of cardiac and periodontal conditions. CRP is synthesized by the liver in response to any type of infection and is mainly stimulated by interleukin-6. It is a short pentatrexin, a multimeric pattern recognition protein that is considered a relatively moderate predictor of coronary heart disease [51], but CRP is also a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality during the year after an MI event [52]. As we discuss below, our patients with Periodontitis (PER) suffered more Mayor Cardiovascular Adverse Events (MACE) and worse left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at follow-up.",992a44e5-abdc-4e6c-8e76-6c6623dc6f9a
21,methods21,"  Our microbiological results show lower values for Pg, Tf, Td and Pi in CGNOPeriodontitis (PER) and similar high figures in both MI The test group (MIG) and CGPeriodontitis (PER). Therefore, cardiac patients have gingival microbiota compatible with periodontopathogen bacteria. Pg and Tf, the main periodontopathogen bacteria related to Periodontitis (PER), are present in large numbers in MI The test group (MIG)NOPeriodontitis (PER), so they are not related to periodontal conditions. We can deduce some deleterious effects on cardiovascular conditions. This aspect agrees with previous data. The presence of all these bacteria was detected in subgingival samples of cardiovascular patients who required endarterectomy [53,54]. One of them, Pg, has been associated with the development of atherosclerosis in animal models [55]. The oral microbiota is part of the digestive tract and is related to the gut microbiota.",32a6a3ac-6a5b-4927-b6f4-bbbeb47a6ca9
22,methods22," Research in animals shows that oral Pg infection disrupts oral and cecal microbiomes, altering their community membership and functional potential [56].  Our study has some limitations. Our patients are Spanish; share specific diet, environmental and cultural characteristics that are different from other populations; and the results should be evaluated based on these issues. We studied only male patients and the results cannot apply to women. The patients with MI The test group (MIG) were explored 48 h after suffering from an MI, so they are patients who survived and had a cardiac recovery; we cannot explore those who did not survive and perhaps they had the worst cardiac conditions.  5. Conclusions  Periodontitis, exercise, diet and smoking are risk factors related to MI. Mayor Cardiovascular Adverse Events (Mayor Cardiovascular Adverse Events (MACE)s) presented in ‘MI follow-up’ show periodontitis, weight, exercise hours and dyslipidemia as risk factors.",0cfe449a-25fb-47e9-a072-6b7e881a47c2
23,methods23," left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) follow-up values are preserved in patients without periodontitis.
