0,introduction0,"Air pollution constitutes a global health hazard, which may activate several pathways involving oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and metabolic impairment. In fact, air pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) and metabolic disorders, adding to the global burden of disease attributable to lifestyle and behavioral factors (Stansfeld, 2015). The effect of chronic environmental exposure is complex since it occurs within the framework of the cumulative impact of exposures over time . This approach recognizes that environmental-related diseases are the result of the totality of a person’s environmental exposures, from all sources and routes, across the lifespan – the so-called exposome (Wild, 2012).  In the last decades, several lines of evidence suggested that molecular effects of environment might extend beyond the interaction with the DNA sequence (Reamon-Buettner et al., 2008; Baccarelli and Bollati, 2009).",a73360ef-15a9-4f25-a71d-7a39881b69ab
1,introduction1," In this context, epigenetics - the study of heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in DNA sequence (Wolffe and Guschin, 2000) – provides opportunities to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of environment-related health effects . Epigenetic signatures, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, histone variants, and chromatin remodeling, are dynamic in response to environmental signals, modifiable during cell differentiation and heritable in daughter cells . Among these, DNA methylation can be potentially modified by environmental and lifestyle factors, reprogramming the genome of exposed individuals and future generations (Burris and Baccarelli, 2014). DNA methylation can regulate gene transcription and chromosome stability via the addition of methyl groups to cytosine residues.",cbca0275-507e-4301-a081-9ce3b5d11dfe
2,introduction2," In mammalian, 5-methylcytosines (5mC) represent 2–5% of all cytosines and are mainly found on CpG dinucleotides, also called CpG sites. Although hypermethylation of CpG sites, located in promoter regions, leads to decreased expression of the genes (Orphanides and Reinberg, 2002), more than 90% of CpG sites are located in transposable repetitive elements . Hypomethylation of transposable repetitive elements has been associated with chromosomal instability and aberrant genome function (Schulz, 2006; Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007). Methylation level of transposable sequences, including both long interspersed nucleotide elements 1 (LINE-1) and Alu sequences, has been used as a surrogate marker of global genomic DNA methylation . Although LINE-1 methylation is not an universally accepted marker of global methylation, aberrant methylation of these sequences was shown to be associated with cancer (Woo and Kim, 2012; Barchitta et al.",9e864440-6440-4564-9279-53364a0a7d30
3,introduction3,", 2014b), cardiovascular disease (CVD) , and degenerative diseases (Maugeri et al., 2018a,b).  Exposure to air pollution, especially to particulate matter, has been linked to epigenetic changes by several epidemiological studies. For instance, a study by Tarantini et al. (2009) showed that long-term exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of less than 10 mm (PM10) was negatively associated with Alu and LINE-1 methylation. Consistently, results from the Normative Aging Study demonstrated that exposure to black carbon, a marker of traffic particles, was also negatively associated with LINE-1 methylation . These findings point out the need of further research to determine whether air pollution leads to LINE-1 methylation changes. However, since nutritional factors may modulate the response to environmental exposure, current environmental health research should incorporate nutrition and dietary practices.",a31b0010-cce4-45fb-ac78-89d6714016ed
4,introduction4," For instance, several classes of nutrients (i.e., folate, polyphenols, selenium, retinoid, fatty acids, isothiocyanates, and allyl compounds) can affect DNA methylation via different mechanisms . Among these, folate is a fundamental methyl donor for cellular replication and maintenance via modulating DNA methylation, synthesis, and repair. However, since current evidence is controversial (Moore et al., 2008; Choi et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011b, 2012; Ono et al., 2012; Piyathilake et al., 2012; Agodi et al., 2015a), its effect remains to be completely elucidated. Focusing on dietary patterns, the adherence to diet characterized by a high intake of vegetables and fruits has been associated with LINE-1 methylation (Zhang et al., 2011b; Agodi et al., 2015a; Delgado-Cruzata et al., 2015).",fa73669c-560a-4268-b437-aff3b9b1ce24
5,introduction5," Despite these findings, lack of evidence still exists about the effect of Mediterranean Diet (MD) – widely recognized as the optimal diet for disease prevention and global health – on LINE-1 methylation. To our knowledge, no studies have simultaneously examined the effects of diet and air pollution exposure in experimental models or humans. The questions that need to be addressed include the interactive effects of both factors on surrogate molecular markers of diseases. Given this scenario, we recently designed the present project, aiming to evaluate whether adherence to MD, as well as the intake of specific nutrients, might modulate the association between air pollution and methylation in healthy women living in Catania (Barchitta et al., 2017b). In previous studies, we demonstrated the effect of both diet and epigenetic mechanisms in several female physiological and pathological conditions (Agodi et al., 2014, 2015a,b; Barchitta et al., 2014a, 2017a,c, 2018).",794fbda0-7451-47b0-bbf2-e030748aada1

7,methods0,"Study Design Women referred to two clinical laboratories of Catania (Italy) were fully informed of the purpose and procedures and invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the involved institution. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the involved institution. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The inclusion criteria were: (i) non-pregnant women (ii) with no current or previous self-reported history of severe diseases, as cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases (iii) who signed a written consent to participate in the study. Information on sociodemographic and lifestyle data were collected by trained epidemiologists using a structured questionnaire. Educational level was classified as low (primary school, i.e., ≤8 years of school) and high (high school education or greater, i.e.",f89c185e-6f69-471c-88d4-9fbb038cff3d

Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m2) and classified based on criteria from the World Health Organization (1995). No exclusion criteria for Body mass index (BMI) categories were applied.  PM10 Exposure Assessment In Catania, air pollutants are continuously measured by a network of five automatic monitoring sites located in the urban area. PM10 levels, recorded by the Ecology and Environment Office of the Municipality of Catania through these monitoring stations and available online as daily means, were assigned to each woman based on their residential address and day of recruitment. Briefly, monitoring stations and residential addresses were geocoded and PM10 measurements from the nearest monitoring station to residential address were assigned.",27ef3f73-b526-4a81-9bfa-73b66b5279f6
9,methods2," For each woman, we recorded the daily mean of PM10 level the day of recruitment and back to 30 days before. We also calculated the monthly mean PM10 level referred to the month before recruitment. Missing values were imputed by an algorithm integrating the annual average of the incomplete series and the PM10 concentrations of the nearest and more correlated monitors .  Dietary Assessment Dietary data were obtained by a 95-item semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)), using the previous month as the reference period . For each food item, women were asked to report the frequency of consumption and portion size. To estimate the amount of each food item and to minimize inaccuracies, an indicative photograph atlas was used. Frequencies of food consumption were classified into 12 categories, ranging from “almost never” to “two or more times a day.",05b4cfbd-e910-44fe-825d-944b9492feed
10,methods3,"” The medium serving sizes were described by natural portions or standard weight and volume measures of the servings commonly consumed in the Italian population. Accordingly, portion size was classified into three categories: small (half a medium serving size), medium, and large (1.5 times or more than a medium serving size). The food intakes derived from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) were calculated by multiplying the frequency of consumption with the daily portion size of each food group. Folate and total caloric intakes were calculated using the USDA Nutrient Database1 adapted to the Italian food consumption. Intake of folic acid from supplements was specifically addressed as previously described .",37a691f4-4a3f-4a03-a7c3-c92ab7babc21
11,methods4," Prevalence of folate deficiency was estimated by comparing folate intake with the Estimated Average Requirements (Estimated Average Requirements (EAR)) (Institute of Medicine (US) Food and Nutrition Board, 1998), taking into account the use of folic acid supplements.  Mediterranean Diet Score Adherence to MD was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS))  which includes 9 components: fruits and nuts, vegetables, legumes, cereals, lipids, fish, dairy products, meat products, alcohol and the ratio of unsaturated to saturated lipids. For components that are more consumed in Mediterranean countries (vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereals, fish, and a high ratio of unsaturated to saturated lipids), women whose consumption was below or equal to the median value of the population were assigned a value of 0, and a value of 1 was assigned otherwise.",4408b643-079b-4bbd-9876-be9b7fc7791d
12,methods5," For components consumed less frequently in Mediterranean countries (dairy and meat products), women whose consumption was below the median were assigned a value of 1, and a value of 0 was assigned otherwise. A value of 1 was given to women consuming a moderate amount of alcohol (5 to <25 g per day). Accordingly, Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) ranges from 0 (no-adherence) to 9 (perfect adherence). MD adherence was categorized, according to the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), as follows: low adherence (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) range: 0–3), medium adherence (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) range: 4–6), or high adherence (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) range: 7–9) (Barchitta et al., 2014a).

13,methods6," DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Italy) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. LINE-1 methylation levels were measured by pyrosequencing-based methylation analysis, using the PyroMark Q24 instrument (Qiagen, Italy), as previously reported (Agodi et al., 2015a; Barchitta et al., 2017c). Briefly, bisulfite conversion and clean-up of DNA for methylation analysis of 30–40 ng of DNA were completed using the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, Italy) and the converted DNA was eluted in 20 μl of Elution Buffer. PCR was conducted in a reaction volume of 25 μl, using the PyroMark PCR Kit (Qiagen, Italy). According to the manufacturer’s instructions, each reaction mixture contained 1.5 μl of bisulfite-converted DNA, 12.5 μl of PyroMark PCR Master Mix 2×, 2.5 μl of Coral Load Concentrate 10×, and 2 μl of the forward primer (5′-TTTTGAGTTAGGTGTGGGATATA-3′) and the reverse-biotinylated primer (5′-biotin-AAAATCAAAAAATTCCCTTTC-3′) (0.2 μM for each) (Agodi et al., 2015b).",ce7b2055-45e2-4840-95a6-1394651ff16b

Then, the PCR product underwent pyrosequencing using 0.3 mM of the sequencing primer (5′-AGTTAGGTGTGGGATATAGT-3′). All runs included 0 and 100% methylated human DNA as positive controls as well as a negative control. To confirm reproducibility every sample was tested two times and failed assays were repeated. Overall, intra-observer coefficient of variability between the two replicates of LINE-1 methylation measurements was 3.2% (SD = 3.0%). LINE-1 methylation levels were calculated as percentage of methylated cytosines over the sum of methylated and unmethylated cytosines, and reported for each CpG site as well as the average of the three CpG sites (GenBank Accession No. X58075).

15,methods8," Descriptive statistics were presented as frequencies, means ± standard deviations (SDs), median values and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)). Prior to analysis, the normal distribution of all variables was checked using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Since LINE-1 methylation exhibited non-normal distribution, differences by population characteristics were tested using the Mann–Whitney U test or the Kruskal–Wallis test. Correlation of daily and monthly PM10 levels with LINE-1 methylation was evaluated using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and presented as a correlation matrix. To evaluate the association of monthly PM10 levels or Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with LINE-1 methylation, we used the following linear regression models: the age-adjusted model; the multivariable model adjusted for covariates that were selected a priori (i.e.",f86fc759-a461-4f20-a48f-353576cf078f

In linear regression models, continuous variables, i.e., LINE-1 methylation level, PM10 level, Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), age, Body mass index (BMI) and dietary folate intake were used. Interaction of PM10 levels and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with LINE-1 methylation was investigated by using the general linear model, adjusting for age, educational level, employment status, smoking, Body mass index (BMI), and folate deficiency. Since interaction was statistically significant, we tested the association of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with LINE-1 methylation by using a multivariable-adjusted model stratified by tertiles of PM10 exposure. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed by the Bonferroni method and adjusted p-values were calculated by multiplying the unadjusted p-value by the number of comparisons.",92a86b0a-a6f4-4211-8447-789dd2bfc16f

20,results3," Figure 2 shows that PM10 levels during 16, 14, 7, 6, and 5 days before recruitment were weakly but significantly correlated with LINE-1 methylation levels. Consistently, a negative significant correlation with monthly mean PM10 level was shown. Scatter plot representing the linear association of monthly mean PM10 level with LINE-1 methylation is shown in Figure 3. In the age-adjusted model, monthly mean PM10 level was significantly and negatively associated with LINE-1 methylation (β = −0.119; p = 0.012). A negative association was also observed in the multivariable regression analysis (β = −0.121; p = 0.037), adjusting for age, educational level, employment status, smoking, Body mass index (BMI), season of recruitment, dietary folate deficiency and use of supplements.

23,discussion0,"Several lines of evidence indicate that dynamic changes in LINE-1 methylation – a well-established event in cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Baccarelli et al., 2010; Woo and Kim, 2012; Barchitta et al., 2014b) – appear to be influenced by environmental and lifestyle risk factors. In this framework, our findings support the relationship between air pollution exposure and epigenetic changes (Baccarelli and Bollati, 2009; Burris and Baccarelli, 2014). In line with previous work (Baccarelli et al., 2009; Tarantini et al., 2009; Madrigano et al., 2011), we observed that exposure to PM10 is negatively associated with LINE-1 methylation in healthy women. The study by Tarantini et al. (2009) conducted in an electric furnace steel plant, demonstrated that PM10 levels impacted on genomic DNA methylation of workers over an extended time frame.",addfc111-3160-4e19-8b54-411b5c07f578
24,discussion1," In particular, they reported that long-term, but not short-term, exposure to PM10 was inversely associated with methylation of Alu and LINE-1 sequences . This evidence, though from a different setting with peculiar exposure, led us to evaluate the correlation of 1-month daily PM10 exposure with LINE-1 methylation. Particularly, we observed that the effect was maximum for the exposure of 6 days before recruitment and spanned from days 5 to 7. Since a negative correlation with monthly mean PM10 level was also evident, we tested the association of monthly PM10 exposure and LINE-1 methylation. Notably, we demonstrated, for the first time, that monthly mean PM10 level was significantly and inversely associated with LINE-1 methylation both in the age- and multivariable-adjusted model.  In our analysis, we also observed that age was negatively associated with LINE-1 methylation.",f1d28251-967b-4582-9cb5-cd485da1b266
25,discussion2," Although some studies reported no effect of aging on LINE-1 methylation (Chalitchagorn et al., 2004; El-Maarri et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011a), our result was in line with previous works, which demonstrated that methylation levels in the repetitive elements, including LINE-1, significantly decreased with increasing age (Bollati et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2012; Cho et al., 2015). However, the observed effect of age on LINE-1 methylation appeared stronger if compared to evidence from previous similar investigations.  Several scientific evidences also suggested that dietary folate status, as well as amounts of other methyl donors, could affect global DNA methylation. However, these findings were conflicting: while the majority of studies demonstrated that global DNA methylation levels increased with increasing folate intake (Moore et al., 2008; Choi et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011b, 2012; Piyathilake et al., 2012; Agodi et al.",2bd5ae2d-1b53-4a5d-974c-faf08d6e471d
26,discussion3,", 2015a), others observed an inverse relationship . This controversy might be explained by differences in unmeasured factors such as ethnicity, genetic variants in one-carbon metabolism, lifestyles, physiological and pathological conditions, which in turn can affect DNA methylation process.  The study of dietary patterns plays an important role in evaluating causes and consequences of PM exposure for human health and disease. This concept raised from the need of a more complete environmental exposure assessment in epidemiological studies, providing a comprehensive description of lifelong exposure history (Wild, 2012). In this context, there is growing interest in determining how dietary patterns may affect global and gene-specific DNA methylation.",a77ded70-6f78-43d1-9629-a73cb96a0dc6
27,discussion4," To our knowledge, the present study was the first to demonstrate that adherence to MD was positively associated with LINE-1 methylation levels, after adjusting for age, educational level, employment status, smoking, Body mass index (BMI), season of recruitment, dietary folate deficiency and use of supplements. This was consistent with previous studies showing that healthy women with high intake of vegetables and/or fruits had a lower risk of LINE-1 hypomethylation (Zhang et al., 2011b; Agodi et al., 2015a). The biological basis of this relationship could be attributed to the wide variety of nutrients and bioactive compounds provided by MD, such as phytochemicals (phenolics, flavonoids, and carotenoids), vitamins (vitamin C, folate, and pro-vitamin A), minerals (potassium, calcium, and magnesium), and fibers, which in turn act on multiple signal transduction pathways and epigenetic mechanisms (Saura-Calixto and Goñi, 2009; Liu, 2013).",cdeb3bfd-2cc6-4c76-9145-eb21d8f6693a
28,discussion5,"  Since we demonstrated the inverse association of exposure to PM10 and adherence to MD with LINE-1 methylation levels, we finally aimed to assess whether adherence to MD could influence the relationship between monthly PM10 levels and LINE-1 methylation. Our findings confirmed not only the interaction between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and PM10 exposure, but also that the positive effect of MD on LINE-1 methylation decreased with increasing PM10 levels.  This study had some limitations. Although hypomethylation of transposable repetitive elements, including LINE-1 sequences, has been associated with chromosomal instability and aberrant genome function (Schulz, 2006; Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007) and with different chronic degenerative diseases (Baccarelli et al., 2010; Woo and Kim, 2012; Barchitta et al., 2014b; Maugeri et al., 2018b), mechanisms of DNA hypomethylation are not fully understood.",b8adf8ef-e311-45fc-92cc-2d0f6c9766b3
29,discussion6," Therefore, the cross-sectional design of our analysis arises the need of further prospective studies and of functional test to explore the causes and the consequences of these modifications and to better understood the biological significance of LINE-1 methylation alterations. Moreover, the peculiar geological and environmental conditions, due to natural sources of particles from the near Mount Etna volcano, sea salt and Sahara dust could be a potential confounder in our study. Although PM10 exposure assessment method has been used in other studies (Cattani et al., 2010; De Prins et al., 2013), this method has not been previously validated in our population characterized by specific PM exposure. Thus, to validate the PM10 exposure assessment method, including both volcanic and usual urban PM exposure, further research should develop a standardized protocol to characterize the mineralogical-chemical composition of PM and to better define exposure.",f75e8b1d-3df9-4a3c-b2cd-d492531cab14
30,discussion7," In addition, limiting our investigation PM10 exposure avoided potential concerns related to the effect of other environmental and work-related chemicals that modify epigenetic marks, including metals (cadmium, arsenic, nickel, chromium, and methylmercury), air pollutants (PM2.5, black carbon, and benzene), and toxicants (diethylstilbestrol, bisphenol A, persistent organic pollutants, and dioxin). Other potential weaknesses regard the dietary assessment and the observed relationship between MD and LINE-1 methylation. Although dietary assessment through Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) does not preclude measurement errors and inaccuracies, the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) used in the present study has been previously developed and validated for use among our population . However, the relationship between MD and LINE-1 methylation may be also affected by genetic factors (i.e.",f8480276-f07b-4a21-94cd-15d10acf19b8
31,discussion8,", polymorphisms in the Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR) gene), which in turn may interact with folate status and methylation process (Agodi et al., 2015c). With regard to molecular analysis, precision and reproducibility of the DNA methylation assay should be considered when interpreting results of the present study. Reliability and flexibility have made pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA the “gold standard,” and a high-throughput and replicable methodology to evaluate LINE-1 methylation (Beck and Rakyan, 2008; Rakyan et al., 2011). However, in the present study, the methylation analysis was performed on white blood cell DNA, including several cell type subsets. Previous studies reported small differences in LINE-1 methylation levels according to target CpG site and blood cell composition (Nelson et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2012; Koestler et al., 2013; Tarantini et al., 2013; Nüsgen et al., 2015).",bfa0207a-4a14-4cb7-bae5-23dd224f9b53
32,discussion9," Thus, the distinctiveness of LINE-1 methylation patterns discourages the comparison between results from studies, which evaluated LINE-1 methylation status at different CpG sites and reinforces the importance of accounting for cellular heterogeneity in future research.  Conclusion In conclusion, results of the present study, conducted in a sample of healthy women, demonstrate the inverse association of adherence to MD and exposure to PM10 with LINE-1 methylation levels.
