0,methods0," Ethical considerations  This hospital-based case–control study recruited 148 women with bacterial vaginosis as cases and 153 healthy women from November 2020 until June 2021. The study was reviewed and authorized by the National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Participants signed the informed consent before inclusion. All procedures were conducted according to the latest version of the Helsinki Declaration (The ethics committee code: IR.SBMU.NNFTRI.REC.1399.054).  Sample size calculation  According to the primary objective, dietary pattern exposure was used to compute the required sample size. The available data indicated that 73% of Iranian adults had adherence to unhealthy dietary patterns19. The odds ratio (OR) for BV was postulated 2.5 among women with unhealthy dietary patterns relative to non-adherence.",fb0c3ce7-dbe8-4008-9522-486c18e8ccbf
1,methods1," A total of 125 BV-affected women (cases) and 125 healthy women (controls) were calculated to attain 80% statistical power for such effect size at a 5% level of significance20. To compensate for over- and underestimation of energy intake or withdrawal, 316 participants were recruited.  Study population  Eligible participants were selected by convenience sampling method among the women referred to the gynecology clinic at Imam Hossein Hospital in Tehran, Iran. A gynecologist examined all patients to evaluate for bacterial vaginosis. Incident cases were diagnosed with a first BV according to the Amsel criteria with at least three of the four determining criteria: a homogeneous and dilute vaginal discharge, vaginal pH greater than 4.5, fish odor after adding 10% potassium hydroxide to the discharge slide, and the presence of 20% of clue cells under saline microscopy21.",f26e1b56-a89d-40be-a458-17c366342a00
2,methods2,"  Eligible participants were 18–45 years old, non-lactating, non-pregnant, not menopause and not suffering from systemic immunity diseases, chronic infection, chronic diet-related diseases (cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.), or any disease in the uterine cavity such as polyp and fibroids as well as lack of hysterectomy. Also, they did not consume vaginal douches, antibiotics, hormonal contraceptives, probiotics, and immunosuppressive drugs. Participants were included in the control group upon the absence of ongoing or previous BV. The exclusion criteria for both BV-affected and healthy women included those who had reported energy intakes outside of the range of ± 3 standard deviation (SD) from the average energy intakes of the study population and were unable to respond to the questions.",f53d055e-6499-4fc4-abee-420c778f6fdb
3,methods3,"  Socio-demographic assessment  A data collection form was developed to gather data on age, history of medication and supplementation, BV family history, education level, occupational status, smoking, number of sex partners, and monthly family income. Due to religious and cultural beliefs in Iranian society, questions regarding alcohol and opium were not determined.  Non-dietary exposure assessment  Anthropometric measures, including weight, height, and waist circumference (WC) were performed following standard protocol by the one qualified examiner for all participants to avoid random observer error. Bodyweight (in kg to the nearest 100 g) was measured with a reliable scale while participants wore light clothing and without shoes. To assess central adiposity, WC (in cm to the nearest 0.1 cm) was measured by an unstretched tape measure at the umbilical site, at the abdominal level, on light clothing, in a standing position, without any pressure on the body surface.",c599da47-d60a-4411-b528-2d14b502961c
4,methods4," Body height (in cm to the nearest 1 mm) was measured by standing and straight tape. The participants were asked to stand straight while the shoulders were in a normal position, without shoes, and with the heels together. Next, the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was computed by dividing weight by height squared (square meters). body mass index (BMI) and WC were categorized according to World Health Organization cut-off criteria22 and the first report of the Iranian National Committee on Obesity23, respectively. Physical activity assessment was based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)), and its validity and stability have been examined in a previous study in Iran24.  Dietary intake assessment  Individuals' typical diets were gathered with a valid and reliable semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) developed and validated in the Iranian population25.",13e29e27-5ed8-4c3f-9e7a-461b630424d2
5,methods5," Participants were asked about their usual intakes over the past year before diagnosing BV for cases and the previous year before the interview in controls. This food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) has been designed according to the Willet method18, including 168 food items with a standard serving size for each food item. The average size of each food item was explained to the participants in the interview. Then, they reported the frequency of consumption of each food item given serving on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. The mentioned values of each food were converted to grams using the household scale guide. The mean daily intakes of energy and nutrients were determined using the Iranian food composition table26 and the USDA food composition table27. ",73d1f353-58db-4714-92ec-75b0447b2f65
6,analysis0," Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Software version 20.0 (SPSS, Inc.). All hypothesis tests were 2-tailed, with a P value less than 0.05 considered significant. Normal distribution of continuous variables was checked using Q–Q plots, histogram charts, and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. General quantitative and categorical characteristics were expressed as median (interquartile range (in Table 2 The median (IQR))) and frequency and percentages. A chi-squared test analyzed differences in the distribution of categorical variables (e.g., familial history of BV). Mann–Whitney test was applied to check differences in the distribution of continuous variables (e.g., physical activity). Factor analysis with the principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) method was used to simplify the factor structure to extract dietary patterns. food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) Food items were classified into 30 groups based on similarity in nutrients, shown in Table 1.",f1aa36f1-cc29-461d-8da1-69da64f22867
7,analysis1," Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO = 0.634) and Bartlett's tests (P < 0.001) were used to endorse the sample size adequacy and data suitability for factor analysis. According to eigenvalue greater than 1.6, the scree plot and percentage of variance greater than 5%, factors (dietary patterns) were retained. Varimax rotation (orthogonal) was used to examine the relation between variables and factors. Food groups with a factor loading of more than 0.4 remained, and factors were specified based on them. Factor scores were measured for each participant, and they were categorized into tertiles. The first tertile was assumed as a reference. The base and multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined by the logistic regression to expound the association between dietary patterns and odds of BV.",8a3f525f-90ac-48a1-8973-656590e98a2f

11,results0," After estimating the participants' calorie intake, 4 BV-affected women and 2 healthy women whose log scale of total energy intake was either >  + 3SD or < -3SD from the mean were excluded from the mean statistical analysis (Fig. 1). Therefore, participation rates were 97.3% and 98.7% among BV-affected and healthy women, respectively.Figure 1 Study flow diagram.  Baseline characteristics of the BV-affected women (n = 144) and healthy women (n = 151) are demonstrated in Table 2. The median (in Table 2 The median (IQR)) age of participants was 30 (25–33) and 32 (24–37) years in BV-affected and healthy women, respectively. Compared to the healthy women, BV-affected women tended to have higher levels of obesity (P = 0.016), higher levels of abdominal obesity (P = 0.05), higher frequency of familial BV (P < 0.001), higher smoker (P < 0.001), and lower calcium supplement use (P = 0.016).",382cb505-4590-4867-8e32-4feb7e1e9b24

16,discussion0," This is the first case–control study to assess the association between dietary patterns and BV to the best of our knowledge. In this research, five principal dietary patterns, including ""Healthy diet,"" ""Unhealthy diet,"" ""Ovo-vegetarian diet,"" ""Pseudo-Mediterranean diet,"" and ""Western diet,"" were identified. Among the dietary patterns obtained, the ""Unhealthy diet"" pattern, defined by high loading of sugar, solid oils, sweets and desserts, red meat, fried potato, refined grains, visceral meat, and sweet drinks, was substantially associated with a higher BV odds. In contrast, a considerable association was found between the ""Ovo-vegetarian diet"" pattern high in all kinds of vegetables, beans, whole grains, and egg and BV in the multivariable-adjusted model. In addition, women with the highest adherence to the ""Pseudo-Mediterranean diet"" pattern high in nuts, and fish, olive, and olive oil also had lower odds for BV in the base model.",56854a47-9f5f-442f-b305-6a7d17f3b68d
17,discussion1," No clear association was found in relation to the ""Healthy diet"" and the ""Western diet.""  The main characteristic of the ""Unhealthy diet"" pattern is a higher intake of saturated fat sources such as solid oils, red meat, fried potato, visceral meat. Similar to our finding, Neggers et al. have shown that saturated fat increases BV risk11. Although the mechanism for the role of saturated fat consumption in BV occurrence remains unknown, a high saturated fat consumption may lead to an elevated vaginal pH and alter the vaginal microflora3,11. Moreover, a high-saturated fat diet may also affect the mucosal immune system11. Another main characteristic of the ""Unhealthy diet"" pattern is high dietary carbohydrate content with a high glycemic index and glycemic load, including sugar, sweets, desserts, refined grains, and sweet drinks. Consistent with our finding, Thoma et al. have demonstrated a direct link between dietary glycemic load and BV progression and persistence10.",d7989b57-32a4-4d58-a41a-543f2ba59780
18,discussion2," High-GI/GL foods overconsumption as an unhealthy diet may be related to the pathogenesis of BV and could influence host response to bacterial colonization through oxidative damage and impaired immune response28,29. In return, participants adhering to a diet composed mainly of plant-based foods had a lower likelihood of BV in our study. The main components of the ""Ovo-vegetarian diet"" pattern include high-fiber and starchy foods, including vegetables, beans, and whole grains. In support, according to Shivakoti et al., higher fiber intake was inversely associated with the odds of molecular-BV30. Diets rich in fiber may reduce the risk of bacterial infections related to BV by affecting the microflora through more Lactobacillus-dominant profiles and positively impacting vaginal health30. Also, three previous studies showed a higher prevalence of BV among non-vegetarians than vegetarians, in line with our results3,31,32.",5e2c3599-e160-4bdd-9c84-6fc121cc01b4
19,discussion3," The practical consequence of the ""Ovo-vegetarian diet"" pattern on BV can explain by creating a suitable environment for Lactobacillus33, lowering vaginal pH, and decreasing oxidative stress34. The vaginal micro ecological environment is affected by diets rich in starch due to high glycogen levels in the genital fluid35. Neggers et al. have also demonstrated an inverse association between severe BV and folate intakes11. Eggs, vegetables, and whole grains have been identified to represent the primary sources of folate. This result reveals the possibility that high intakes of folate sources may improve the immune system and are associated with decreased risk of BV11.  The current study has several potencies. The dietary pattern-based investigation was used to assess the total dietary intakes rather than individual dietary intakes.",80363f47-fbf2-472a-9eb2-b4884c02cb17
20,discussion4," Since some foods may act synergistically, the dietary pattern approach provided better information about the correlation between dietary intake and diet-related diseases36. Dietary patterns derived from a validated-food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Participants who under- or over-report their energy intakes were excluded. Newly diagnosed BV patients were included. Incident case selection would support a causal interpretation and control the recall bias37,38. High participation rates were obtained in both cases and controls. Information on several potential covariates was available to adjust in regression models. One person in the hospital laboratory performed a diagnostic test in both groups to control information bias. Besides, a trained dietician completed the questionnaires and was blinded to the diagnostic results during the interview. However, the current study has several limitations.",bf69430c-07aa-4bc2-aeb1-1439856dd242
21,discussion5," This study did not use the Nugent score for BV diagnosis, although it is the gold standard for BV assessment. Although researchers tried to minimize bias as much as possible, selection bias, measurement bias, and recall bias might result in misleading findings in a case–control design. Different types of bacteria causing the BV were not considered in the current study. The cultural and religious taboo on alcohol and opium in Iran prevented the collection of data on these variables. Besides, the current study did not consider percentages of body fat, and the only criteria to assess obesity was the body mass index.  Conclusion  To conclude, the results revealed that the ""Ovo-vegetarian diet"" characterized by all kinds of vegetables, beans, whole grains, and eggs decreases the odds of BV in this sample of Iranian women.",7b3755b6-b6e7-43ea-b382-33f415b7dd33
22,discussion6," However, the ""Unhealthy diet"" pattern defined by high sugar, solid oils, sweets and desserts, red meat, fried potato, refined grains, visceral meat, and sweet drinks increases the odds. Therefore, it is recommended that these findings should be considered in nutritional education and dietary recommendation to prevent BV. The findings need to be confirmed by further longitudinal dietary research to clarify whether dietary change is feasible and affects BV outcomes.
