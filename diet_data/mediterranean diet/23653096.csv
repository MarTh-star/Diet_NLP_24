0,background0,"Benefits of physical activity There is abundant scientific evidence of the biological and psychological benefits of physical activity [1]. On the other hand, low cardiopulmonary fitness is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity-mortality, while improved physical fitness is associated with a decrease in mortality risk [2]. The results of a metaanalysis on the influence of physical activity upon blood pressure indicate a mean reduction of 3.8 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) and 2.6 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) [3]. Aerobic exercise could attenuate arterial hardening as observed in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study, in which male athletes had a lesser pulse wave velocity (pulse wave velocity (PWV)), augmentation index (AIx) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) than sedentary individuals [4].",1e26aa7a-32ff-4092-a097-52074e0f94ae
1,background1," Improvement in carotid artery elasticity has also been recorded in previously sedentary subjects who started a physical exercise program [5]. Aerobic exercise has been related to a decrease in atherosclerosis progression in humans [6]. The results of the first phase of the EVIDENT study [7] have demonstrated an association between physical exercise and improved vascular structure and function [8]. An association has also been reported between the time people spend seated and mortality. However, the results are even more relevant on combining the time spent seated (6 hours a day) with low physical activity (< 24.5 mean energy expenditure (MET)S/hours/week), yielding a relative risk (RR) of 1.94 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.70-2.20) for women and 1.48 (95% CI: 1.33-1.65) for males, as opposed to those who spend less time seated and have greater activity [9].",8191f008-f587-4e1b-bfd2-bbc56b87df84
2,background2," The EVIDENT study has also found increased arterial stiffness to be related to the number of hours spent watching television [10]. On the other hand, physical activity shows an inverse correlation to the concentrations of fibrinogen [11].  Interventions for increasing physical activity Although there is abundant evidence of the benefits of physical activity, the percentage of individuals who may be considered active is low in our setting [12]. In the United Kingdom, the prevalence of sedentarism reaches 60% in males and 74% in females [13], while in Spain the PEPAF (Experimental Program for Physical Activity Promotion) recorded a 75% sedentarism rate [14]. Different methods have been used in an attempt to promote physical activity, though with conflicting results. A Cochrane review concluded that there are no data to support the hypothesis that multiple-component community-based procedures are effective in increasing the physical activity of the population [15].",2dd1ab1e-35fb-41a1-975c-d307fddeb724
3,background3," A recent metaanalysis of studies in the primary care setting has concluded that the promotion of physical activity in sedentary subjects increases the number of individuals who are classified as active subjects after 12 months (odds ratio (OR): 1.42; 95% CI: 1.17-1.73), though the effect has not been demonstrated over the long term [16,17]. The PEPAF study intervention resulted in an increase in physical activity versus the controls of 18 min./week (95% CI: 6–31 min./week), with a rise in mean energy expenditure (MET)S/hours/week of 1.3 [95% CI: 0.4-2.2]. The proportion of individuals reaching the recommended minimum physical activity was 3.9% greater in the intervention group (1.2% to 6.9%) than in the control series. Few randomized, controlled clinical trials have evaluated the impact of interventions in terms of a decrease in sitting time, though an intervention designed to promote walking while working was able to reduce the daily sitting time by 21 minutes [18].",85708cb1-9177-4734-a78f-20ab50de8232
4,background4," Evidence is even more limited in populations with chronic diseases, though an intervention in type 2 diabetics has recorded a reduction in daily sitting time of 23 minutes [19].  Benefits of the Mediterranean diet The Mediterranean diet is presently regarded as the model of most healthy diet. It reflects the traditional eating habits of countries such as Greece, southern Italy and Spain. The main characteristics of this diet are: a) important consumption of cereals, legumes, nuts, fruit and vegetables; b) use of olive oil for cooking purposes and for the dressing of salads and vegetables (representing the main source of fat in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids); c) moderate to high consumption of fish; d) moderate to low consumption of chicken and dairy products; e) low consumption of red meats and meat products; and f) moderate alcohol consumption, mainly in the form of red wine with meals [20].",fefd28b7-9d5e-4fad-8809-09b60d782c36
5,background5," There is convincing evidence that the Mediterranean diet may have a positive effect upon endothelial function [21] and can lower peripheral blood pressure [22]. A correlation has also been established with vascular structure, as assessed by carotid intima-media thickness [23], as well as with decreased mortality due to any cause [24] and, more specifically, due to coronary disease [25]. The results of the EVIDENT I study found obese males to show the poorest adherence [26].  Interventions for improving eating habits (Mediterranean diet) Few intervention studies with the Mediterranean diet have been carried out. A randomized clinical trial (the Lyon Diet Heart Study) [27], involving a modified model of the Mediterranean diet versus a control diet, concluded that the Mediterranean diet is associated with a marked reduction in cardiovascular mortality and in the incidence of cardiovascular complications among patients who have suffered myocardial infarction.",61e169d3-2604-48bc-b3b6-3d47f13d9f92
6,background6," However, prior to publication of the PREDIMED (Prevention with Mediterranean Diet) study [22], no randomized clinical trial had investigated whether the effects of the Mediterranean diet are superior to those of a low-fat diet in relation to the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The PREDIMED study [22] was designed to determine whether the Mediterranean diet supplemented with virgin olive oil or nuts prevents the development of major cardiovascular complications in high vascular risk individuals, compared with a low-fat diet. In its initial phase, this study recorded an average increase of 1.8 points on the 14-point scale assessing adherence to the Mediterranean diet, versus an increase of 0.3 points in the control group [28]. During the first year, this implied a decrease in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components and in the incidence of diabetes mellitus [28,29].",31a84f96-7bca-4ea8-8d61-c1839e9cac9d
7,background7," Furthermore, after four years of follow-up, the subjects in the intervention groups (Mediterranean diet) showed a 30% decrease in the incidence of major cardiovascular complications versus the control series [30].  Evaluation of arterial aging Aging is associated with increased arterial stiffness, which can be evaluated with different clinical and biological tools. The accepted gold standard for assessing arterial stiffness is the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (pulse wave velocity (PWV)) [31], which has been correlated to increased morbidity-mortality in both patients with cardiovascular disease and in healthy individuals [32]. Central arterial pressure has also been shown to be more strongly correlated to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than peripheral blood pressure [33].",ae229cc4-2fce-430f-a029-29d136b4a43c
8,background8," The central and peripheral augmentation indexes are markers of arterial stiffness which together with aortic systolic pressure and aortic pulse pressure complement the information afforded by pulse wave velocity. The cardio-ankle vascular index (cardio ankle vascular index (CAVI)) also evaluates arterial stiffness, and is able to estimate the risk of atherosclerosis and vascular age. This parameter moreover is independent of arterial pressure [34,35].  Information technology as a support for improving health Considering the trend in recent years in the use of mobile telephones, and the recent introduction of smartphones, it can be estimated that within 10 years, a full 80-90% of the population in developed countries will have one of these devices [36], and probably with many more applications than are available today. Information technology is finding many applications in the field of health and Medicine.",5c495c95-8786-4a88-9f3d-4ea3ebf852bf
9,background9," Recently, short message service (short message service (SMS)) communication has demonstrated its usefulness in helping people to stop smoking [37]. Smartphone applications designed to assist healthcare personnel both in training and in decision making processes in daily clinical practice and in emergency care are increasing, and there is already some evidence of their usefulness [38]. Such applications have also been used in patient care for monitoring biological parameters [39], detecting falls in the elderly [40], preventing cognitive impairment [41] and monitoring diabetes [42], as well as in cardiac rehabilitation [43] and also in the promotion of physical activity [44] and the management of [45]. Communication based on the use of mobile phones, and especially smartphones, has a strong potential to transform healthcare and clinical interventions in the community [36].",b0eb6b0e-e7e7-40eb-bd3a-6e261064af3e
10,background10," However, its effectiveness needs to be evaluated in multicenter clinical trials, as recommended by the United States Food and Drug Administration (Food and Drug Administration (FDA)), in a way similarly to what is done with drug substances. A metaanalysis of the use of information technology in dietetic evaluation has concluded that it could improve dietary assessment in some population groups, though improved validity and reliability is required in evaluating micronutrients [46]. Many applications have been developed in the field of health, and specifically in relation to diet and exercise, destined for use by the general population. Although the acceptance and ease of use of such applications has been evaluated among young adults for the registry of eating habits and physical activity [47], they have not been tested in other population types, and little is known of their effectiveness in relation to health outcomes.",a590130b-eb8b-49f1-9fcf-2e3b1003c04c
11,background11," Few studies have validated these tools, though some investigations are presently in course [48]. Even less work has been done to explore the impact of such applications in relation to increased physical activity and improved eating habits, and hence in terms of improvement of the health of the people who use them [49].  The present study aims to provide evidence of the effect which the new information and communication technologies, and specifically smartphone applications, could have as tools supporting changes in favor of more healthy lifestyles. An evaluation is also made of the effect of such changes upon arterial aging.  Objectives The first objective of this study is to develop and validate a smartphone application supporting standardized counseling to increase physical activity and adapt eating habits to the recommendations of the Mediterranean diet.",2831d9c9-2bea-40fe-8a9b-6cea2b377c2e
12,background12," The second and central objective of the study is to quantify the effect attributable to the developed smartphone application in terms of the modification of habits, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, and increased physical activity. Lastly, an evaluation is made of the effect of the modification of habits upon vascular structure and function, and therefore on arterial aging.  Methods/Design Design and setting This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind clinical trial involving two parallel groups, designed to evaluate the possible effects of adding an information and communication tool (intervention) in support of behavioral and educational counseling (control) to promote increased physical activity and adaptation of eating habits to the Mediterranean diet.",eb0d5485-be39-4684-be86-768be95ad24a
13,background13,"  The study will include 6 groups of the Research Network on Preventive Activities and Health Promotion (REDIapplication (APP)) in Bilbao, Cuenca, Zaragoza, Valladolid, Barcelona and Salamanca (Spain), as a continuation of the EVIDENT project developed in 2010–2012.  Subjects Study population The study population will be selected from the EVIDENT project [7], comprising 1,553 subjects randomly selected in the primary care setting. The study will exclude patients over 70 years of age (due to difficulties in using information and communication tools among such individuals), those unable to do exercise or follow the Mediterranean diet, as well as those subjects who meet any of the exclusion criteria of the EVIDENT project (known coronary or cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease; heart failure; moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; musculoskeletal disease that limited walking; advanced respiratory, renal,",16ab4707-f9cb-46c4-9e17-cf6c7d0e491d

The rest of the subjects will be randomised on a centralized basis from Salamanca using the Epidat 4.0 software package to intervention (IG) and control groups (CG) with a ratio of 1/1. Of the 1553 subjects, it is estimated that 10-15% will be excluded; the resulting sample therefore will comprise 1,350 individuals. We estimate that another 10% will reject participation, i.e., we expect to include at least 1,215 subjects in the final sample.  Sample size Estimation of sample size has been made for the main study endpoints. Regarding physical exercise, and assuming α = 0.05 and β = 0.10, with a standard deviation (SD) of 154, we would need 1,110 subjects (555 per group) to detect an increase of 30 counts/minute in IG versus CG.

Variables and measurement instruments The general and potentially effect-modifying variables, such as age, gender, occupation, smoking, alcohol consumption, personal history and drug use will be documented.  Mobile phone tool for evaluating healthy lifestyles The developed tool is the result of an agreement between the company CGB and the GIAPCyL research group of the REDIapplication (APP) (RD12/0005/0004), through the Infosalud Fundation (Figures 1 and 2).

16,background16," It can be used to quickly evaluate the adaptation of living habits to healthy lifestyle recommendations referred to both eating and physical activity. An evaluation will be made of the quantity and quality of food intake according to standardized references, with the purpose of assessing adaptation of the eating habits of the individual to the Mediterranean diet. Based on adequate proportions of primary food elements, a personalized recommendation will be produced, depending on the entered intake characteristics. The application will generate detailed information on the eating deviations (diet composition and calories), with a view to facilitating changes in habits. Physical activity also will be evaluated, using an accelerometer included in the smartphone application, and which will count the steps taken over a period of 24 hours. The activity reported by the subject during periods in which the device is not used (e.g.",241ac6ac-0b50-4692-8615-06baaddcdfa4

18,background18," ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers (ActiGraph, Shalimar, FL, USA) will be used to evaluate principal endpoint of psychical activity, which have been previously validated [50-52]. ActiGraph is a monitor that uses a piezoelectric acceleration sensor to filter and convert the signals produced from the sensor in samples collected at a preset frequency in hertz. The samples are summed over a user-specified time sampling interval, called an “epoch”. Output from the ActiGraph is in the form of activity “counts,” where one count is equivalent to 16 milli-g per second, and where g is equal to 9.825 m · s - 2, the acceleration of gravity. Activity “counts” are recorded to the internal memory of accelerometers by converting acceleration units over a given epoch [53]. Subjects will wear the accelerometer fastened with an elastic strap to the right side of the waist for seven consecutive days with habitual physical activity, except for bathing and performing activities in the water.",f05a5cb8-89f7-4e23-bc88-d5f9b521cdfc

The MAHUFFE software, available from: http://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/research/resources/materials-transfer-disclaimer/physical-activity-downloads/ (accessed: 30/12/2013), will be used to analyze the data. Sequences of 10 or more consecutive zero counts will be considered non-wearing time and excluded from the analyses. Inclusion criteria will be a minimum of 4 days of recording, including at least 1 weekend day and at least 600 registered minutes per day. The main outcome variable from the activity monitor will be the average intensity of physical activity (counts/minute), calculated with equal weighting given to each day (regardless of registered time per day).",42f192f2-236c-4d33-a9af-178ef1483dd5

Moderate-vigorous activity will be considered as activity accumulated from all bouts lasting at least 1 min.  The 7-day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) is a general measure of physical activity, which has been recognized as valid and reliable tool in recent years and is widely used in epidemiological, clinical and behavior change studies. It consists of a semi-structured interview (10-15 minutes) in which participants provide an estimate of the number of hours dedicated to physical or occupational activities requiring at least a moderate effort in the past seven days.

34,background35," Maintenance is considered to have been reached when the new behavior persists for over 6 months. f) Relapse: The subjects start the cycle over again, i.e., they no longer adhere to the desired behavior.  Adherence to the tool Adherence will be assessed by means of the Morisky-Green test [66], and by assessing the number and days of recordings in the device.  Intervention Common to both groups  Counseling on physical activity Both groups (control and intervention) will receive counseling on physical activity with a view to favoring compliance with the current recommendations on physical activity in the general population. The intervention has demonstrated its effectiveness in the PEPAF study [14] and in the Prescribe Vida Saludable (Prescribe Vida Saludable (PSV)) program (Osakidetza).",76cc9b4e-9661-4999-9386-718289db7063
35,background36," Counseling will consist of an individual visit lasting 15 minutes in which an explanation will be given of the health benefits of physical activity, with the recommendation to perform at least 30 minutes of moderate activity 5 days a week, or 20 minutes of vigorous activity three days a week. Counseling will be standardized in both groups, and the subjects will receive an informational brochure (Additional file 1) on the session. The first part (5 min.) will address the recommendations on physical exercise in relation to cardiovascular health. The second part (8 min.) will develop knowledge of the intensity of some specific physical activities such as walking, riding a bicycle, or other activities. The last part (2 min.) will be dedicated to answering questions and doubts. Specific advice will be given to reduce the number of hours spent sitting.   Nutritional counseling Both groups (control and intervention) will receive nutrition counseling aimed at favoring adherence to the MD.",dc354719-3531-49bd-94d5-d93776feb7ef
36,background37," This intervention has been shown to be effective in the PREDIMED study [22]. Counseling will consist of an individual visit lasting 15 minutes in which the concepts of the MD will be explained, with insistence upon the importance of complying with each of the recommended points. Counseling will be standardized in both groups, and the subjects will receive an informational brochure (Additional file 1) on the session. The first part (3 min.) will develop the concept of the MD. The second part of the session (10 min.) will focus on each particular recommendation, with brief and clear messages. The last part of the interview (2 min.) will be dedicated to answering questions and doubts.  Specific of the intervention group The subjects in the IG will receive a smartphone for three months, corresponding to the intervention period.",b830cb90-d92f-4e6d-bc08-fda4a4fbbe9a
37,background38," A first visit lasting 15 minutes will be used to provide training in the use of the device, which should be employed daily for the full three-month period of the intervention. The investigator will instruct the participants on the use of the tool that evaluates food intake, on how to enter the information and receive the recommendations, and on how to use of the accelerometer and read the generated information – with the recommendation to reach a total of 10,000 daily steps. The subjects will be required to daily enter food intake (breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, and dinner), selecting the dishes and foods from the application menu. Regular physical activity will be recorded with the accelerometer of the device, together with due registry of those activities performed without the smartphone (swimming, football, etc.).",a5e5caac-1eb3-4696-a6be-8b6b27bc721c
38,background39," Lastly, the final daily summary will be reviewed, with a balance of food intake and physical activity, and the device will offer a recommended plan for the next days, with a view to improving eating habits and increasing physical activity. A new visit will be held one week after supplying the device, in order to confirm that it is being used correctly, and to clarify any possible doubts. The smartphone will be returned after three months, coinciding with the common review visit.  Blinding strategy The investigator performing randomization and intervention in the IG will be different from the investigator conducting evaluation and the rest of interventions, blinding will be maintained during the study, and the investigator performing data analysis also will be blinded. Due to the nature of the study, the subjects cannot be blinded to the intervention.",bd8ebccf-0bdc-4a9e-aebb-f7c0c6da9a6b
39,background40,"  Project schedule The project is planned as three yearly periods with subsequent follow-up to evaluate the long-term effects of the intervention. In a previous phase conducted in 2013, the software for the smartphones was developed by the company CGB, and a prior pilot evaluation was carried out in Salamanca among users of both sexes with different ages and cultural levels, to confirm the practical feasibility of the tool and introduce any necessary changes. In the present project, pilot evaluation will be made in 2014–2015, along with recruitment of all the subjects and conduction of the first visits, while in 2015–2016 we will complete the follow-up visits (12 months) – with conclusion of the operative phase of the project on 31 December 2016.

40,analysis0,"The results will be expressed as the mean ± standard deviation for quantitative variables or using the frequency distribution for qualitative variables. Analysis of the results will be made on an intent-to-treat (intent to treat (ITT)) basis. Statistical normality will be tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Use will be made of the chi-squared test to analyze the association between independent qualitative variables, along with the McNemar test for paired samples. The Student t-test will be used for the comparison of means between two groups, and the paired t-test will be applied to assess changes within one same group. Alternatively, the corresponding nonparametric tests will be used, as required. The relationship between quantitative variables will be analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient or Spearman coefficient in the case of asymmetrically distributed variables.",3bdf4ca6-9606-405b-a4ad-c3b4cf202cfb
41,analysis1," Multivariate linear regression analysis and logistic regression analysis will be used to analyze the variables determining the changes in physical activity and eating habits, and in the arterial stiffness parameters (pulse wave velocity (PWV), AIx and cardio ankle vascular index (CAVI)). In order to analyze the effect of the intervention, comparison will be made of the changes observed in the control group (CG) versus the intervention group (IG), with estimation of the Cohen d statistic, adjusting for the variables that may influence the results. Logistic regression will analyze the odds ratio (OR) for achieving the objectives of diet and exercise compliance. A multilevel analysis will be performed to determine the effect of the different recruitment centers. Gender will be contemplated in the analysis to assess differences between males and females in terms of adherence to the smartphone application, and in the middle- and long-term results.",630711fb-e273-4cc5-b7a4-781679695274
42,analysis2," Likewise, an analysis will be made according to the degree of motivation at baseline assessment and adherence to use of the smartphone. The effect of the intervention could be modified by age, gender, cultural and socioeconomic level, body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) and certain disease conditions, as well as by the baseline lifestyles, which will be controlled in the analysis. The contrasting of hypotheses establishes α = 0.05. The IBM-SPSS version 20.0 statistical package will be used throughout.  Quality control In order to ensure data quality, the nursing professionals in charge of data collection will receive specific training. Regular external monitoring will then be performed in the six health centers to verify adequate application of methods, both in performing the different examinations and collecting the information.",cd73b25d-a401-449b-bfdb-e6fa93baed57
43,analysis3,"  Methodological limitations The study follows all the recommendations of the CONSORT, though in view of the nature of the intervention, the participating subjects will not be blinded to the intervention. Since we are dealing with lifestyle modifications, the analysis of the main results referred to the Mediterranean diet is based on self-declared data, even though use will be made of validated tools and the general food questionnaire, which may serve as quality control. In any case, objective data will be available in the case of physical exercise (accelerometer). Difficulties in using the application may increase the number of dropouts in the intervention group.",912c7048-2578-4e96-8cbb-1ffcec22a73e

46,discussion0,"The exponential development of smartphone applications in the field of healthcare has not been accompanied by sufficient scientific evidence of the usefulness of such applications in improving the health of the population. As has already been called upon by different organisms, and more specifically by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it seems necessary to conduct experimental studies similar to those used in pharmacological treatments, in order to obtain sufficient scientific evidence of the possible usefulness of these tools.  The EVIDENT I study obtained evidence of the association between healthy lifestyles - particularly physical activity and diet – and vascular structure and function. Specifically, less physical activity or prolonged sedentarism was associated to greater aging of the vascular system [10,68].",f8d1452e-7e87-462d-af63-ce1f499d10f6
47,discussion1,"  The EVIDENT II study developed a smartphone application that has already been tested in a prior pilot phase designed to assess its reliability in the recording and analysis of diet and physical activity, as well as in relation to the counseling needed to improve these parameters and come closer to the international recommendations referred to the compliance with the Mediterranean diet and physical activity equivalent to at least 10,000 steps a day.  With this project we hope to demonstrate that regular use of this application for at least three months is able to modify certain habits, resulting in eating habits more in line with the Mediterranean diet, which has already demonstrated its benefits in terms of cardiovascular morbidity-mortality [30].",d400adb5-05c2-49ea-9a00-46b6ad48b45a
48,discussion2," Likewise, we hope to increase the physical activity of the participants and to raise the proportion of individuals considered to be active, as this should imply multiple improvements in health – as has already been demonstrated in different studies [1-3].  Although over the short term it will be difficult to demonstrate the health benefits of the changes in diet and physical activity, over the middle term we hope to demonstrate that the use of this tool can not only improve living habits but also afford benefits in terms of vascular function - improving the parameters that assess arterial stiffness, such as AIx, cardio ankle vascular index (CAVI) and pulse wave velocity (PWV).  Therefore, the results of this study could lead to a strategy based on the use of new technologies to delay arterial aging, combining increased physical activity and eating habits adapted to the Mediterranean diet.",01eee7c7-76ee-41cd-a7ec-2a7dc97144bf
