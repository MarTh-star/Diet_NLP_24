0,methods0,"4.1. Plant Material In this work, three varieties of cardamom (fruits/seeds) were purchased from a local market in Jeddah city (KSA) in 2014 including the green cardamom (Elattaria cardamomum L. Manton), Ethiopian cardamom (Aframomum corrorima) and black cardamom (Amomum subulatum). The plants were identified by Pr. Al-Sieni Abdulbasit and voucher specimens were deposited in the CERTE (Technopark of Borj Cedria, Tunisia). One hundred grams of plant seeds were distilled for three hours with distilled water (500 mL) using a Clevenger-type apparatus [43]. The obtained essential oil was refrigerated in sealed glass vials at 4 °C until analysis.  4.2. GC–EIMS Analysis and Identification of the Components Gas chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry GC/EIMS analyses were performed with a Varian CP-3800 gas-chromatograph (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a HP-5 capillary column (30 × 0.25 mm; coating thickness 0.",3d6bcca6-6300-4c49-8af1-e9a70a8988c2
1,methods1,"25 μm) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion trap mass detector (Varian, Inc., CA, USA). Analytical conditions: injector and transfer line temperatures at 220 and 240 °C, respectively; oven temperature was programmed from 60 to 240 °C at 3 °C/min; carrier gas helium at 1 mL/min; injection of 0.2 mL (10% hexane solution); split ratio 1:30. Identification of the constituents was based on comparison of the retention times with those of authentic standards, comparing their Linear Retention Indices relative to the series of n-hydrocarbons, and by computer matching against commercial (NIST 98 and ADAMS 95) and home-made library mass spectra built up from pure substances and components of known essential oils and MS literature data [44,45,46,47]. Moreover, the molecular weights of all the identified substances were confirmed by GC/CIMS, using methanol as CI ionizing gas [48]. Analysis was also run by using a fused silica HP Innowax polyethylenglycol capillary column (50 m × 0.20 mm i.d., 0.",5b9c6635-e14d-45a2-9953-12420f219af0

Antimicrobial Activities The antimicrobial effect of the three volatile oils was tested against 25 food-borne pathogenic bacteria including 25 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and against seven yeasts including six Candida spp. strains and one Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain by using the disk diffusion assay [49,50]. For the experiments, a loopful of the microorganisms working stocks was enriched on a tube containing 9 mL of enrichment broth (Mueller Hinton for bacteria and Sabouraud Chloramphenicol for yeast) then incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. The overnight cultures were used for the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils used in this study and the optical density was adjusted at 0.1 (OD600nm). The inoculums were streaked onto MH (1% NaCl for Vibrio strains) agar plates using a sterile swab.",fc99ac76-8fce-4458-a8dd-437ccf77de83
3,methods3," While, the yeast strains were inoculated onto Sabouraud dextrose agar (Biolife, Milan, Italy) and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The yeast cultures were harvested and then suspended in sterile saline (0.8% NaCl) and the cell density was adjusted to 107 cells/mL (OD540= 0.5). The fungal inoculums were streaked onto fresh Sabouraud dextrose agar plates using a sterile swab.  A sterile filter discs (diameter 6 mm, Biolife, Milan, Italy) were impregnated with 10 mg of each essential oil. Ampicillin (10 mg/mL) was used in this study as positive controls for all bacterial strains tested. The dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. The diameter of the zones of inhibition around each of the disks was taken as measure of the antimicrobial activity. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and the mean diameter of the inhibition zone was recorded.  4.3.2.",b9c2010c-9c6f-4931-b8fb-ea085ec17a94
4,methods4," Microdilution Method for the Determination of the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC)/minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) The minimal inhibition concentration (minimal inhibition concentration (MIC)) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC)) were determined for all bacteria tested in this study as previously described [51,52]. The minimal inhibition concentration (minimal inhibition concentration (MIC)) and the minimal fungicidal concentration (minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC)) were determined for all Candida strains as described by Noumi and coworkers [7].  The inocula of the bacterial and fungal strains were prepared from 12 h broth cultures and suspensions were adjusted to 107 UFC/mL.",b727f9d7-a486-4bd7-8761-e7b3c049f2f5
5,methods5," The essential oils dissolved in 10% dimethylsulfoxide (dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)), were first diluted to the highest concentration (100 mg/mL) to be tested, and 200 µL of the essential oils stock solutions were serial twofold diluted in a decreasing concentration range in the 96 well-plate. All 96-well plates were prepared by dispensing into each well 195 µL of the correspondent broth and 5 µL of the bacterial/fungal inocula. The last well containing 195 µL of nutrient broth without essential oil and 5 µL of the inocula on each strip was used as the negative control. The final volume in each well was 200 µL. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h.  The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) value was determined as the lowest concentration of the sample that did not permit any visible growth of the tested microorganism after incubation.",18e21fa8-6708-400b-b961-73085b937b7c
6,methods6," The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC)/minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) values were interpreted as the highest dilution (lowest concentration) of the sample, which showed clear fluid with no development of turbidity and without visible growth. All tests were performed in triplicate.  4.4. Anti-Quorum Sensing Activities of the Essential Oils The anti-quorum sensing activities of the tested essential oils and their main component 1,8-cineole were tested by using three reporter strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and the mutant strain Chromobacterium violaceum CV026. The P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. While, the mini-Tn5 mutant C. violaceum 026 strains that produces violacein pigment only in the presence of exogenous C6-and Gram negative bacteria (AHL) was grown in Luria-Bertani broth medium at 32 °C.  4.4.1. Effect on P. aeruginosa PAO1 Virulence Factors The following QS-controlled virulence factors in P.",bd721098-109c-496a-a218-f454dd03d4cf
7,methods7," aeruginosa PAO1 (swarming, elastolytic, and proteolytic activities) were tested as previously described [53,54].  The effect of the tested oils and 1,8-cineole on the swarming activity in P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain was performed in Luria Bertani semisolid medium (Biorad, France) prepared at 0.5% agar and supplemented with different oils concentrations ranging from 10 to 400 µg/mL. The Petri dishes plates inoculated with P. aeruginosa PAO1 were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and the extent of swarming was determined by measuring the swarming diameter using a 1 cm flat ruler.  For elastolytic activity, P. aeruginosa PAO1 was grown in LB broth medium supplemented with different concentrations of essential oils and 1,8-cineole and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Then, 100 µL of the culture supernatant was added to 900 mL elastin congo red (ECR, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l. Milan, Italy) buffer (100 mM Tris, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5) containing 20 mg ECR (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l. Milan, Italy).",4c459738-e9d7-4a0c-a339-55b320e11271
8,methods8," The eppendorf tubes were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The insoluble ECR was removed by centrifugation and the absorbance of the supernatant was estimated spectrophotometrically at OD495 (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan).  For proteolytic activity, 100 µL from the culture supernatant, obtained as mentioned above, was added to 900 mL ECR buffer containing 3 mg azocasein (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l. Milan, Italy) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, 100 µL of trichloroacetic acid (10%, v/v) was added to all reaction tubes. After 30 min, the tubes were centrifuged and absorbance of the supernatant was measured by reading spectrophotometrically at OD440 (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).  4.4.2. Effect on Violacein Production Inhibition of violacein production in the presence of tested essential oils and their major component (1,8-cineole) was tested according the method described by McClean and colleagues [55].",8acb3b1d-4860-456c-93dd-0150d05fdaf7
9,methods9," For this, two microlitres of essential oil or 1,8-cineole (2 mg/disc) were loaded to the sterile disks and placed on the surface of CV026 inoculated LB agar plates supplemented with 50 µL of 1 µg/mL of C6-HSL. The plates were incubated upright at 32 °C for 24 h and zone of inhibition of QS was detected by the presence of colourless but viable cells around the disks and the zone of growth inhibition was also recorded.  4.5. Phytotoxic Activity of the Essential Oils The phytotoxic activity was evaluated on germination and root elongation of three different plant species: R. sativus cv “Saxa” (radish), L. sativum (garden cress) and L. sativa (lettuce). These seeds are well known from the histological point of view and usually they are used in assays of phytotoxicity because of their easy germinability. The seeds of R. sativus and L. sativum were purchased from Blumen group srl (Piacenza, Italy), the seeds of garden cress from Euroselect (Bari).",f8e5cc0a-47af-4919-98c1-bd5b15a80e03
10,methods10," The seeds were surface sterilized in 95% ethanol for 15 s and sown in Petri dishes (Ø = 90 mm), containing five layers of Whatman filter paper, impregnated with distilled water (7 mL, control) or the tested solution of the essential oil (7 mL), at the different doses. The germination conditions were 20 ± 1 °C, with natural photoperiod. The essential oils, in water-acetone mixture (99.5:0.5), were assayed at the doses of 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.062 µg/mL Controls performed with water-acetone mixture alone showed no appreciable differences in comparison to controls in water alone. Seed germination was observed directly in Petri dishes every 24 h. A seed was considered germinated when the protrusion of the root became evident [56]. After 120 h (on the fifth day), the effects on radicle elongation were measured in cm. Each determination was repeated three times, using Petri dishes containing 10 seeds each.",3933eccf-f1dd-4907-9241-190802a2a14d
11,methods11," Data are expressed as the mean ± SD for both germination and radicle elongation [57].  4.6. Statistical Analysis All data were expressed as Means ± Standard Deviation (S.D.). Each analysis was performed using the SPSS 16.0 statistics package for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The differences in mean were calculated using the Duncan’s multiple range tests for means with 95% confidence limit (p = 0.05). A principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) and cluster analysis (CA) were performed in order to discriminate between the three cardamom varieties on the basis of their essential oil composition. All analyses were performed by the “Statistica v 5.1” software (Statsoft. Inc., EEUU). ",28cbb8d2-99ac-4d9d-9fb4-368caeee69e6
