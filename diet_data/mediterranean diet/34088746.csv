3,methods3," Briefly, 95 μL of samples were mixed with 5 μL of anti-human anti glycophorin A Franklin Lakes NJ USA) and Anti Glicophorin A antibody (FITC)-antibody and incubated for 20 min at room temperature (RT) on a roller. Before analysis, 80 μL of labelled MVs were dissolved in 400 μL of 0.9% NaCl and transferred to 1.5 mL tubes. MVs were quantified by flow cytometry, as previously described.  4.5. Confocal Microscope Analysis  RBC were treated with HgCl2 and Ca2+ ionophore in the presence or the absence of HT, TYR and HA, as described above. After incubation (24 h for Hg treatment), RBC were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 (pH 7 4 (PBS)) and counted in a Burker chamber. The confocal laser scanning microscope analyses were performed according to Nguyen [74], with few modifications.",43d4551f-24e9-4f3e-9d87-d9b08f4325a0
4,methods4," In brief, the cells were then fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C, then washed several times and incubated with anti-human anti glycophorin A Franklin Lakes NJ USA) and Anti Glicophorin A antibody (FITC) antibody for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Afterwards, the samples were placed on glass slides and air-dried for 1 h. The slides were dipped quickly, and gently washed stepwise with ethanol from 50% to 75%, 90%, and then 100% for dehydration. Finally, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde and washed three times with pH 7 4 (PBS). For confocal laser scanning microscope imaging, several randomly selected frames from each sample were captured for morphological observation and statistical strength. Excitation and emission filters were set at 488 nm and 550–600 nm, respectively.  4.6. reactive oxygen species (ROS) Determination  reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was determined using the dichlofluorescein (DCF) assay, according to Tagliafierro et al.

5,methods5," Using this method, 250 µL of intact RBC (hematocrit 10%) were incubated with dichlofluorescein (DCF)H-DA at a final concentration of 10 µM for 15 min at 37 °C. After centrifuging at room temperature at 1200× g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed, and the hematocrit was re-adjusted to 10% with Krebs solution. RBC were then treated concurrently with HgCl2, Ca2+-ionophore and selected phenolic compounds in the dark (4 h for Hg treatment). After the incubation, 20 µL of RBC were diluted in 2 mL of water, and the fluorescence intensity of the oxidized derivative dichlofluorescein (DCF) was recorded (_exc502; _em520). The results were expressed as fluorescence intensity/mg of hemoglobin. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Perkin Elmer Life Sciences LS 55 spectrofluorimeter.  4.7. Assay for Reduced glutathione (GSH)  By reaction with DTNB, the intracellular glutathione (GSH) content was assessed, according to Tortora et al. [76].",b8f1633e-f9bb-41ab-bfae-cc0a5bbe8935
6,methods6," After incubation (4 h for Hg treatment), samples (0.25 mL) were centrifuged for 5 min at 800× g. After removal of supernatants, RBC were lysed using 0.6 mL of cold water and proteins were then precipitated by the addition of 0.6 mL of a cold metaphosphoric acid solution (1.67 g metaphosphoric acid, 0.2 g EDTA, and 30 g NaCl in 100 mL of water). The samples were placed at 4 °C for 5 min, and then the precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 18,000× g for 10 min. Finally, 0.45 mL of supernatant were mixed with an equal volume of 0.3 M Na2HPO4. To determine the reduced glutathione (GSH), 0.1 mL of a DNTB solution (20 mg DTNB plus 1% of sodium citrate in 100 mL of water) was added to the solution. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance of the samples was measured at a wavelength of 412 nm.  4.8. Statistical Analyses  Data evaluations were expressed as means ± S.D. of 3 independent experiments performed in triplicate with RBC from different donors.",f749e239-b3e4-4440-9f12-2b01641103b3
