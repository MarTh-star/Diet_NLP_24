In the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (BPRHS), the National Cancer Institute-Block food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) of 126 items was revised, and validated in this population58. In Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN), the Diet History Questionnaire (Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ)), consisting of 124 food items and developed by the National Cancer Institute, was used. Validity of the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ) has been assessed59. In Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea Study (PREDIMED), food consumption was determined by a 137-item validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)60. In Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), the baseline food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) was developed specifically for Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) and included regional foods and foods consumed in minority populations.",708c8b02-c828-42bd-98af-8b24f514fb91

Milk intake was analyzed as continuous and multivariable adjusted regression coefficients (for untransformed and square root transformed intakes) were estimated. Meta-analysis of the beta coefficients for observational milk intake in determining fasting glucose was also carried out as described above.  To examine the association between the MCM6-rs3754686 SNP and incidence of major cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (total, stroke and myocardial infarction) and total mortality in participants of the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea Study (PREDIMED) study, we used Cox regression models with length of follow-up as the primary time variable.",5da27e8b-3a36-4619-be40-d08e37466e60

The exposure time was calculated as the time between randomization and the date of a major cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the date of the last interview, December 1st 2010, or the date at death, whichever came first as previously reported44. We first estimated incidence rate for the three genotypes and fitted codominant, recessive and additive models. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the MCM6 SNP were estimated. Models were multivariable adjusted for covariates as indicated (Model 1 and Model 2). An additional adjustment of the estimations by total milk intake was considered in Model 3 as well as the additional adjustment for total fat and carbohydrates (Model 4).",2608b259-d520-4ab2-8253-e7aee2191cd9

The likelihood ratio test was used to obtain the P values for interactions. As statistically significant interaction terms were obtained, we carried out stratified analyses of the associations between the MCM6-rs3754686 SNP and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) incidence and total mortality in men and women separately. Furthermore, considering that the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea Study (PREDIMED) is a randomized, controlled dietary intervention trial, we evaluated the modulation by diet of the associations between the genetic proxy for milk intake and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and total mortality by sex.",ba3a06fe-8394-4987-ad65-1a7bf38ecf1e

We considered a P < 0.1 as suggestive of interaction27 and estimated the HRs for the MCM6 SNP, stratified by dietary intervention groups (MedDiet versus control diet). For the Cox regression analyses, we graphically checked the assumption of proportional hazards for the genetic factor (MCM6 SNP) by looking at the Log-Log plot of survival. We obtained parallel lines for the curves of genotypes in all the models fitted supporting the proportional hazards. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to estimate the probability of remaining free of total cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or total mortality during follow-up.",d6829768-8f96-4750-8664-48117103e232

24,analysis12," Taking into account that most of the variables analyzed (total dairy with total milk, HDL-C with triglycerides and other cardiovascular biomarkers, etc.) have a high correlation between them, it would not be appropriate to correct the alpha value per number of comparisons undertaken, as this would increase the probability of false negatives too much. So, for the correction for multiple comparisons, we consider three groups of variables: the dairy intake group, the biomarkers group and the incidence of hard events group. In this way, the value of alpha corrected for multiple comparisons would be P < 0.05/3 = 0.017. Using this correction we minimize the possible risk of false positives without increasing too much the probability of false negatives Thus, the adjusted alpha was 0.05/3 = 0.017.

Although we observed the association between the MCM6-rs3754686 SNP and milk intake to be statistically significant on studying men and women jointly, we wished to also investigate the associations in men and women separately given that previous studies had not provided these data in detail828 and that prior evidence exists for sex-based heterogeneity both in milk intake22 and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk17182930.",417e93ec-eb10-44c1-8791-d82740bf6f82
65,discussion4," The results of the sex-differences in meta-analysis suggested that the effect of the association between the SNP and milk intake is greater in women than in men and reaches statistical significance (including after correction for multiple comparisons) when all populations are included. However, the statistical significance of the difference by sex was attenuated on eliminating African-American women in the sensitivity analysis (as there was a departure from HWE in this group). This departure from the equilibrium, in addition to a potential bias31, may simply represent a slight departure due to the large sample size of this population (>7000 individuals for dairy intake analysis), taking into account that for biomarkers (only available for 807 women, the HWE was reached; P > 0.05), or that for evolutionary reasons, the equilibrium is still being reached. Bergholdt et al.",817cfcd1-d954-4cb4-a2d7-5059ba50c031
66,discussion5,"8 proposed a similar argument in their Mendelian randomization study between the MCM6-rs4988235 SNP in Danes, where they observed deviations from the HWE in two Danish populations and they did not exclude these populations from the Danes analysis. In our study, we undertook a sensitivity analysis for all the associations, excluding the African-American women for comparative purposes. Although our elimination of a large group attenuated both magnitude and statistical significance of effects, there is still a significant difference in the association of the proxy SNP with milk intake between men and women, which should be the subject of further studies.  Previous studies have employed the sex-stratified approach for examining heterogeneity by sex in Mendelian randomization studies2132333435, for alcohol, rather than milk consumption.",e951ad10-a2d5-4ee8-9604-7b803d2e779a
67,discussion6," When the ALDH2 association with alcohol consumption was analyzed by sex, higher associations were observed in men than in women213435 thus providing prior evidence of heterogeneity by sex for instrumental variables. Social and cultural factors influence food intake and may contribute to sex-specific findings for milk as well as alcohol; for example, women may traditionally be more likely to prepare meals, the lactose content of which may be consistent with their own LP status.  On analyzing the association of the instrumental variable with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk factors, we did not find any statistically significant association in the population as a whole. However, in the sex-stratified meta-analysis, the T-allele was significantly associated with lower fasting glucose in women, but not in men, the heterogeneity by sex being statistically significant (P for sex differences <0.017).",3c7850e9-0d8e-40d4-adf2-36761dfb78e3
68,discussion7," The association in women, where the T-allele that is associated with higher milk intake is inversely associated with fasting glucose, is consistent with previous studies that show that the greater intake of milk or dairy products is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes3637. Nevertheless, in observational studies, heterogeneity by sex has not been investigated and warrants further investigation. We have previously identified sex as an important source of heterogeneity in genetic association studies, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related phenotypes (obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes)16, also including milk38.  Similarly for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk factors, when we analyzed the association of the MCM6 SNP proxy for milk intake in the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea Study (PREDIMED) study with incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and total mortality in the population as a whole, we did not find significant associations.",2e32796b-17c1-48f1-b92d-f6e09d38ec26
69,discussion8," This would support previous studies that reported no association between milk intake and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or mortality394041 and also the Mendelian randomization results of no association of the MCM6 SNP with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in Danes8. However, on examining heterogeneity by sex, we did find significant differences in the association of the MCM6 SNP between men and women: in women the T-allele associated with higher milk intake is associated with higher cardiovascular diseases (CVD) incidence and mortality, primarily in the group of women that received the MedDiet intervention. Previous studies have also suggested a possible interaction by sex in the effects of milk intake on mortality4243, but more evidence needs to be gathered. We know of no previous study analyzing the association between the MCM6 locus and total mortality available for comparison with our results.",72264ba3-1563-490a-8600-a7be2120bad7
70,discussion9," Sex-specific findings associated with the MCM6 locus in Mendelian randomization studies have not previously been described, and such findings have important implications for its potential use as a proxy for intake. The mechanisms by which the CC genotype (lactase nonpersistence) is protective against cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in women in the current study are not clear due to the ambiguous relationships of the MCM6-rs3754686 SNP with glucose and lipids. Furthermore, the complexity of our observations is mirrored in the Mendelian randomization in Danes28 that reported an interaction between milk intake and the lactase persistence genotype for the outcome of diabetes, in such a way that lactase persistence was protective against diabetes in milk consumers and tended to increase risk in non-milk consumers.",7991c279-03ce-4bde-8d70-c6765ccd5bc9
71,discussion10," In other words, the effect of the genotype depended directly on the intakes of the participants, complicating the reliance on the genotype as a determinant of dietary intake that can predict disease. This observation is analogous to our findings that lactase non-persistence status reduces cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk in the context of the Mediterranean diet intervention, a dietary pattern that is characterized by relatively low milk intake44. The authors of the study on Danes argued that their observation could be due to a collider stratification bias, consisting of unmeasured confounding induced by selection bias45.",690dafdb-e081-427b-95ae-06d4b0a7fd94
72,discussion11," In our Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea Study (PREDIMED) study we cannot fully assess whether our observation is due to a collider bias or not, as the risk of that bias always increases when stratification is undertaken, but, in the case of the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea Study (PREDIMED) study, the strata were assigned at random, thus minimizing the bias that lifestyle variables may cause aside from the dietary intervention itself. Therefore our results suggest that MCM6 SNPs may have several limitations when used as genetic proxies to assess the role of milk or dairy products in complex diseases if no additional considerations (i.e. dietary pattern) are taken into account. Of note is the limitation that the MCM6 SNP does not provide information of the specific type of dairy product (e.g., low-fat, high-fat) consumed. These limitations have been outlined as relevant446.  In interpreting our observations several areas are amenable to hypotheses.",c8fcd2f8-6c7c-4f41-8f80-4f44024b9870
73,discussion12," While the positive selection signal at the lactase locus is among the strongest of any in the human genome4748, natural selection is likely to have modified many additional loci, in a fashion referred to by McCullough et al. as a “domino effect”, whereby a change at one locus was linked to a series of additional genomic adaptations49. Some authors have reported that lactase persistence is associated with a variety of diverse disease phenotypes, including Crohn’s disease and common cancers5051. Hypothetically, we could postulate that lactase persistence was associated with selection for a heightened immune response, which may be manifested in some as an overall pro-inflammatory phenotype that could be linked to a range of modern, chronic diseases. Therefore, pleiotropy, which refers to a single locus affecting multiple traits410, may be present in the associations observed.",1341e20e-90ed-4fc8-9484-99fb15c33b9d
74,discussion13," In contrast, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) protection conferred by the MedDiet is postulated to act via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative mechanisms5253. We may extend this reasoning to suggest that a combination of protections stemming from female sex, an anti-inflammatory dietary intervention (Mediterranean) and lower genetically-based inflammatory burden (lactose non-persistence genotype) may have enabled us to detect the specific signal in the current study. Clearly, additional studies directed at investigation of potential links between lactase persistence and inflammation/oxidative stress are needed.  In conclusion, the current study represents an extensive exploration of a single MCM6 SNP for associations with dairy intake and disease phenotypes, which is strengthened by its use of meta-analysis in several populations and longitudinal, intervention-based outcomes.",1465424c-9077-483a-b9e5-3e7c39283118
75,discussion14," Our findings revealed that the MCM6-rs3754686 is associated with milk intake in Mediterranean and American populations and add new information about context-specific effects in Mendelian randomization studies. The potential heterogeneity by sex or the dietary context should be examined in further studies, and if confirmed, the corresponding interaction terms may be used as instrumental variables to strengthen the causality level of the Mendelian randomization approach.
