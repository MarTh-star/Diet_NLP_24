0,introduction0," The global COVID-19 pandemic has created health uncertainty, especially among groups at risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes [1]. Policies to prevent disease transmission, include containment and mitigation [2]. COVID-19 was identified in Israel during mid-March 2020. As of May 2020, and despite a relatively low case-fatality rate of 31/1,000,000, social distancing and a full lockdown was implemented in Israel [3]. The outbreak itself and the measures taken to control it have been shown to cause significant psychological distress and were associated with anxiety in China, Italy, and Spain [4–6].  Social isolation and home quarantine can produce changes in eating behaviors, food intake, and physical activity patterns, thus influencing body weight and overall health and wellbeing [7, 8].",87ef5b7b-7f5d-423b-847c-c074be590732
1,introduction1," An association between anxiety and intake of specific foods has been documented; Elevated intake of added sugars and saturated fats, but not increased calorie intake per se, has been shown to be positively associated with anxiety [9]. Limited research, especially in animal models, has demonstrated an association between anxiety and weight loss [10]. More generally, anxiety has been associated with increased emotional eating [8, 11, 12], obesity, and other risk-to-health behaviors in adults [13, 14]. At the same time, higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 are associated with comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, hypertension, and certain cancers [15]. Strategies to reduce the metabolic burden, including implementation of a balanced, healthy diet, may also protect against anxiety [16].",c935af5d-a634-4219-a379-6ae4bb47fbfb
2,introduction2,"  The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), characterized by frequent intake of olive oil, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, fish and nuts, and infrequent intake of red and processed meats and added sugars, is associated with reduced all-cause and cause-specific mortality [9, 17]. Moreover, the MedDiet is associated with reduced risk of chronic and degenerative diseases, including certain cancers, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [9, 18, 19]. Thus, the degree to which an individual adheres to the MedDiet can be used as an estimate of diet quality [20].  Few studies have evaluated changes in eating patterns and mental health symptoms in the general population during a pandemic [8, 21–24]. Local policies and differences in background population characteristics require tailored research to examine changes in food patterns and anxiety.",283d2126-df3b-439b-8b99-ec3c631bcfbc

4,background0," Increased anxiety was frequently reported during the 2020 global COVID-19 pandemic. An association between anxiety and increased body weight has been documented. Identifying associations between diet quality and anxiety may facilitate the development of preventive dietary policy, particularly relevant since obesity appears to increase the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. In this study we aim to examine associations between changes in diet pattern and body weight and anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic among Israeli respondents to an international online survey.

5,methods0," Design  The present cross-sectional survey was conducted online using a convenience sample. Anxiety was assessed using the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) subscale. The survey assessed the extent to which the current participant diet is similar to the MedDiet (a measure of diet quality); respondent-reported change in diet quality and body weight; and demographic characteristics.  Ethics  The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board (Helsinki Committee) of Ariel University, Israel. Each participant provided informed consent prior to responding to the survey. Individuals who did not provide informed consent (indicated by clicking on the appropriate button) could not proceed with the survey.

Participants were encouraged to re-post the survey link on their own social media to expand exposure.  Study population  The study population included all adult individuals who elected to complete the survey online and who provided informed consent by clicking on the appropriate button. Only the first response to the survey was included among individuals who responded more than once.  Inclusion criteria  All adult individuals (aged 18 or older) who responded to the survey were included in any of the study languages: Arabic, English, French, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish or Russian.  Exclusion criteria  Subjects who indicated that their age is younger than 18 years and those who did not provide informed consent were excluded.",3070e831-5e5f-45df-94e8-f8ae8c16c928

The survey could not be completed without first providing informed consent. Responses were automatically recorded in Google Survey.  Survey development  The survey was translated from its original Hebrew to the following languages: Arabic, English, French, Italian, Russian, and Spanish. Each translation was performed by a native speaker of the target language who was also fluent in Hebrew. Once translated, the translation was back-translated to Hebrew by an individual bilingual in both the target language and Hebrew, thus validating the translation.  Survey characteristics  Data were anonymous, though respondents had the option of providing an e-mail address to which information about his/her MedDiet score was mailed.",776098b2-6960-43a7-8f47-54deca302547
8,methods3," The following data were elicited in the survey: 1) demographic information: age; sex; country of residence; education; work setting; current occupational status; current quarantine/isolation; health status; 2) nutrition questionnaire (MedDiet, self-reported weight change, and diet quality change) 3) anxiety questionnaire (GAD-7).  MedDiet score  The Israeli Mediterranean diet screener (I-MEDAS) used in the current study was adapted from the original, 14-item questionnaire. The I-MEDAS predicted mortality in a prospective multi-ethnic, population-based cohort of Israeli adults. The I-MEDAS is scored such that a given question receives a value of 1 if the criterion was met, and 0 if it was not, so the total I-MEDAS score can range from 0 to 17 points [25].  Anxiety score  The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was used to measure anxiety.",10bfdad6-2aba-4bea-a9a2-107b9804b881
9,methods4," This questionnaire is validated for use in the general populationin each of the seven languages in which the present survey was conducted [26]. The participant is asked to refer to the 2 weeks prior to the survey when responding to a set of statements. Each GAD-7 item is scored as follows: 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 (more than half of the days) 3 (nearly every day). The total GAD-7 score can thus range from 0 to 21, where a higher score indicates greater anxiety [27]. Cut-off scores for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety symptoms are 5, 10, and 15, respectively [28].  Sampling procedures  The sampling method is best described as a convenience sample with a snow-ball distribution as the survey was uploaded to both public and personal social media sites, and respondents were requested to re-post the survey on their own social media.

26,discussion0," The present study indicates that diet quality was inversely associated with anxiety during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic: every one-point increase in the MedDiet score was associated with an almost 7% decrease in the odds of moderate to severe anxiety. More than 50% of study participants had a GAD-7 score consistent with at least mild anxiety. This rate is considerably higher than the prevalence of anxiety in the general population, which is estimated to be 1.9–5.1% [30].  High levels of anxiety were reported in other countries during the first outbreak stages, using online cross-sectional surveys. A study among the Chinese population assessed anxiety using the GAD-7 questionnaires and reported on 35.1% with moderate anxiety [21]. A survey among Italian adults using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y) reported on 37.19% who were defined in a higher state of anxiety [31].",d5177e03-0af0-4277-8398-9530dec32aaf

Evidence examining factors associated with anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel are limited. A recently published study suggested that increased psychological distress was more common among younger women with pre-existing chronic conditions [33], higher anxiety rates were reported among pregnant women [34]. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression was reported in additional study [35], at the same manner in a survey conducted among 1500 Jewish respondents aged 20–65 a high percentage of respondents reported an increase in depression compared with the regular pre-COVID situation [24].",9ef6d4cc-5aa9-4942-80e5-ab675ca01b69
28,discussion2," Although differences in anxiety measures and differences in coping strategies across countries preclude a direct comparison, the relatively high level of anxiety in our study may reflect that anxiety was measured during a nation-wide total lockdown. Findings from in-depth interviews indicate that among those experiencing higher anxiety, the lockdown has been associated with more significant challenges such as lack of space in the home environment, shortage in access to supplies, lack of savings, and loss of income [36].  It has been shown that metabolic status (including obesity), age, and sex influence the clinical severity of COVID-19 [37]. Poor diet quality (which may foreshadow obesity) age and sex were associated with both diet quality and anxiety in the present study. A higher MedDiet score was also associated with less self-reported weight gain and an improved diet pattern during the pandemic.",536434b8-9e52-4371-9174-0cca59b1e2e3
29,discussion3," Increased MedDiet score was associated with reduced odds of moderate to severe anxiety, while a decline in diet quality during the outbreak compared to the pre-pandemic diet increased risk for this outcome, even after controlling for key explanatory variables. Our findings are in agreement with results from Mediterranean countries. In a recent study conducted in Greece and Spain, higher anxiety scores (as measured by the GAD-7) were associated with lower MedDiet scores [22]. In addition, adverse eating behaviors, such as restrained and emotional eating, were associated with higher symptoms of depression and anxiety.",e3a0b183-ceff-4048-be54-265e19d12f65
30,discussion4," Findings from a recent international survey indicate that the COVID-19 related quarantine, was associated with overeating and consuming food of a poorer quality [8], similar findings were reported in an Israeli survey in which concern about deterioration in their financial situation, poor health, and gender (women) predicted a significant increase in the amount of food intake [24]. Additionally, a study from Poland reported on either weight loss and weight gain among adults during lockdown [38].  Israel has an efficient primary care healthcare system, providing a broad basket of services [39], which can improve the identification of patients with anxiety at times of crisis. Since the mental health reform in July 2015, Israeli citizens and permanent residents are entitled to receive mental health care services through their chosen health fund, with the costs of care covered by the funds [40].",a38fbbb0-f38a-4607-a022-ece9e463d2c0
31,discussion5," Mental health issues carry a stigma, which may lead to avoidance of help-seeking since primary care physicians participate in the referral process [41]. However, a previous study in a national representative sample of adult Israelis has shown gender differences in the use of mental health services, with women being more likely to seek mental health help regardless of socioeconomic or morbidity [42]. In the current study, female sex emerged as a significant risk factor for anxiety. Therefore, the first step could be anxiety screening through the primary healthcare system, which could make this a national priority during the pandemic. This would encourage the four Israeli health plans to approach this disease like any other and use standard disease management tools.",761f1d60-9c89-4019-b730-c0c8a5a3e2fb
32,discussion6," Additionally, since we found that worsening of diet quality during the pandemic and weight gain doubled the odds for higher anxiety, we suggest that physicians will consider referring people with high anxiety or weight gain during the pandemic to dietitians. Furthermore, dietitians in healthcare should be informed on those associations and alert primary health care physicians in case of concern.  Therefore, steps should be taken to improve case-finding of people with higher anxiety among primary physicians and those with adverse eating behaviors among dietitians. This requires the provision of appropriate diagnostic instruments, training of medical staff, feedback to physicians and nurses, and raising awareness among the relevant patient population and their caregivers.  Findings herein must be considered in the framework of study limitations. The data are cross-sectional. Associations between diet quality and anxiety are correlational only.",8c8f38cb-842c-4f83-beb5-1c4284b9bb14

Conclusions  In summary, this online survey conducted in a variety of widely-spoken languages in Israel demonstrates a high frequency of anxiety symptoms in Israel and an inverse association between diet quality and anxiety level. Poor diet quality was associated with weight gain, which could contribute to obesity.
