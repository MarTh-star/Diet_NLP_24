0,introduction0,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world’s growing population. The prevalence of DM in adults worldwide is estimated to rise from 382 million in the year 2013 to 592 million in the year 2035 (International Diabetes Federation 2013). The major part of this increase is expected to occur in developing countries, with the greatest absolute increase expected to be seen in India. According to the IDF (2013), 65.1 million people in India had DM in 2013. DM is characterized by increased blood glucose level as a result of disrupted insulin-signalling, which leads to insulin deficiency resulting from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β-cells in the case of type-1DM, or insulin resistance and declining β cell function in type-2 DM. The type-2 DM accounts for more than 90–95% of all cases of DM globally.",5112c36d-4e6b-4ae6-a7b4-0d5a4674e7e2
1,introduction1," It has been reported that prolonged exposure to uncontrolled chronic hyperglycemia in DM can lead to the impairment of the metabolism of glucose, lipids, proteins and glycoprotein components (Dhawan et al. 1996).  Glycoprotein is a conjugated protein covalently linked to one or more carbohydrate groups. They participate in various biological events such as cell–cell communication, protein stability, function, turnover, membrane transport, cell differentiation and recognition (Wiese et al. 1997). Thay are found on the surface of all cells and some are released into the bloodstream and body fluids, making blood and plasma more viscous (Thirunavukkarasu & Sakthisekaran 2003). It is well-documented that the carbohydrate moieties of glycoprotein components, such as hexose, hexosamine, sialic acid and fucose are hydrophilic, make glycoproteins far more hydrophilic and allows the protein to fold into proper geometry and ensure stability (Wu 2003).",e611cb04-0890-43d5-9d41-4781629d52ac
2,introduction2," The carbohydrate structure of glycoprotein components is altered in many pathological conditions, including DM (Pari & Murugan 2007; Pari & Karthikesan 2009). Impaired metabolism of glycoprotein components may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of hepatic and renal diseases in DM. However, insulin deficiency during DM produces derangement of glycoprotein components metabolism, resulting in the thickening of the basal membrane of pancreatic cells. Further, an increase in the levels of glycoprotein components in diabetics indicates angiopathic complications (Konukoglu et al. 1999).  Several modern drugs are effective in preventing DM, but their prolonged use may lead to adverse effects. Hence, considerable attention has been shifted to the use of dietary constituents and natural products as an alternative or complimentary treatment for diabetic medication to reduce the adverse effects caused by the synthetic drugs.",61e6b3ff-166c-4a5d-a8f0-345d77af97bb
3,introduction3," Tyrosol [4-(2-hydroxyethyl) phenol] is a well-known phenolic compound and is mainly present in extra-virgin olive oil and white wine (St-Laurent-Thibault et al. 2011). It exhibits neuro-protective, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and anti-depressant effects (Bu et al. 2007; Chernyshov et al. 2007; De Stefano et al. 2007; Ahn et al. 2008; Panossian et al. 2008).  Previously reported the antihyperglycemic effect of tyrosol in streptozotocin (streptozotocin (STZ))-induced diabetic rats and exhibits a dose-dependent response in glycaemic control (Chandramohan et al. 2015). In continuation of our research on tyrosol, in this investigation, an attempt has been made to evaluate the effects of tyrosol on plasma and tissue glycoprotein components in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The effects produced by tyrosol are compared with a standard hypoglycemic drug, glibenclamide.",b68b7b15-dcfa-4591-9634-01acca2bd2ac

22,discussion0,"streptozotocin (STZ) has been extensively used to induce DM in experimental rat models. The intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin (STZ) (40 mg/kg body weight) causes partial destruction of pancreatic β-cells in rats that decrease the synthesis and secretion of insulin and causes hyperglycemia (Punithavathi et al. 2011; Sheikh et al. 2015). The increased levels of plasma glucose and decreased levels of insulin observed in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were brought back to near normal by tyrosol treatment. We previously reported that tyrosol treatment significantly decreased plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and significantly increased plasma insulin, total hemoglobin and body weight in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.",896a5e8f-8a21-4548-bc93-e37c67e85ea7
23,discussion1," The activities of key carbohydrate metabolic enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase were significantly decreased and the activities of hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were significantly increased in the liver and kidney of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats treated with tyrosol. Further, a significant increase in glycogen content in the liver and muscle, glycogen synthase activity in the liver and a significant decrease in the activity of liver glycogen phosphorylase were observed in diabetic rats treated with tyrosol. Tyrosol may have enhanced the insulin secretion from remnant pancreatic β cells, which in turn enhanced glucose utilization by peripheral tissues of diabetic rats either by promoting glucose uptake and metabolism, or by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis, thereby decreasing blood glucose levels (Chandramohan et al. 2015).",41bebbac-3dc2-4de5-89dc-c26a7be6ccac
24,discussion2,"  In diabetic state, abnormalities of glycoprotein metabolism are commonly observed (Anil Kumar et al. 2005). We observed elevated levels of hexose, hexosamine, sialic acid and fucose in the plasma of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic control rats. The secretion or shedding from cell membrane glycoconjugates into the circulation leads to the elevation of plasma glycoprotein components. Also, insulin deficiency and high levels of plasma glucose in diabetic condition may result in an increased synthesis of glycoprotein components (Patti et al. 1999). Tyrosol and glibenclamide treatment to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats significantly decreased plasma glycoprotein components to near normal levels, by virtue of its antihyperglycaemic effects.",d7a0bf87-70d5-4978-b1e2-6f8facedbace
25,discussion3,"  Sialic acid can be used as a measurement of the acute phase response because many of these glycoproteins have sialic acid as the terminal, non-reducing positions of carbohydrate chains on the outer and inner membrane surfaces (Pickup 2004). Sialic acid levels on glycoproteins are regulated by sialyltransferases during their cellular biosynthesis and, in some instances, by sialidase(s) after secretion from cells. A decrease in sialyltransferase and an increase in sialidase activities (Chari & Nath 1984; Cohen-Forterre et al. 1990) as well as changes in other glycosidase activities (Serrano et al. 1983) have been reported in humans and animals suffering from DM. Also, diabetic rats exhibited increased levels of sialic acid in the plasma and decreased concentration in tissues (Pari & Murugan 2007).",cdc7f169-c3f7-4f76-b977-8de09e34331f
26,discussion4," The decreased level of sialic acid is observed in the diabetic rat’s tissues might be due to increased synthesis of fibronectin, which contains sialic acid in its core structure (Basha & Sankaranarayanan 2015). Further, the decreased tissue sialic acid level is associated with oxidative stress-induced desialylation of glycoproteins (Goswami & Koner 2002). In our study, tyrosol treatment normalized sialic acid levels in the plasma and tissues of diabetic rats, which could be due to the regulation of sialidase activity, by virtue of its antihyperglycaemic effects.  Hexosamine a nitrogenous sugar in which an amino group replaces a hydroxyl group. The level of hexosamine increased significantly in the plasma and tissues of diabetic rats, which may be due to insulin deficiency.",ab18635c-5a62-4d61-b563-19ecce7de1b6
27,discussion5," Further, the concomitant oxidative stress increases the expression of GFAT (Glutamine: Fructose 6-phosphate amino transferase), the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway leading to higher hexosamine levels (Brownlee 2005). Protein-bound hexose in the cell membrane provides hydrophobic nature. In this study, we observed increased levels of hexose in the plasma and tissues of diabetic rats, which may be due to depressed utilization of glucose by insulin-dependent pathway, thereby enhancing the formation of hexose and hexosamine for the accumulation of glycoproteins (Patti et al. 1999). Treatment with tyrosol and glibenclamide significantly lowered hexose and hexosamine levels, which might be due to its antihyperglycaemic effects.  Fucose is a member of a group of eight essential sugars that the body requires for the optimal functioning of cell-to-cell communication and its metabolism appear to be altered in various diseases such as DM (Mondoa & Kitei 2001). Wiese et al.",afed24b0-cfdc-4525-82f6-197a85e6f890
28,discussion6," (1997) suggested that serum and hepatic fucosyltransferase and fucosidase activities are increased in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Fucosylation reactions confer unique functional properties to glycoproteins. The observed increased concentration of liver and kidney fucosylated proteins in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic control rats might be due to increased synthesis and decreased degradation of this protein. Tyrosol treatment to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats significantly decreased fucose concentration, which may be due to the regulation of the fucosylated protein levels, by its antihyperglycaemic effects.  Also, confirming the biochemical findings, we carried out Periodic acid schiff (PAS) staining of liver and kidney. The Periodic acid schiff (PAS) stained sections revealed glycoproteins accumulation in the liver and kidney of diabetic rats.",5b7cff67-a0e2-4923-bf36-4050520a683c
29,discussion7," Tyrosol treated diabetic rats showed near normal liver and kidney morphology, which indicate that tyrosol decreased glycoprotein components accumulation in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.  Furthermore, we studied in vitro scavenging effect of tyrosol on ABTS•+. The decolorization of ABTS•+ cation radical is an unambiguous way to measure the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds. Our study revealed that tyrosol-scavenged ABTS•+ concentration dependently. Tyrosol at the concentration of 150 μM showed the highest scavenging effect compared to the other five doses (25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 μM). Our results revealed definite scavenging activity of the tyrosol towards ABTS•+ in comparison with butylated hydroxytoulene (butylated hydroxytoulene (BHT)). Thus, tyrosol is a potent antioxidant.  In conclusion, tyrosol treatment reduced accumulation of glycoprotein components in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats in addition to its antidiabetic effect.",28bc3248-624a-4c41-898a-38722735e5b2
30,discussion8," Tyrosol also exhibited in vitro antioxidant property. The observed effect of tyrosol on decreasing the adverse effects of hyperglycemia provides an insight into the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, and may be used in therapeutic approaches.
