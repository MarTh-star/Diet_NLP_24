0,methods0," 2.1. Cohort and Selection Criteria  Study participants consist of mother/infant dyads enrolled in the Newborn Epigenetics Study (Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST)), based in Durham, North Carolina. As described in detail in [3], these analyses assess the same n = 325 dyads that completed both a food frequency questionnaire and an Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA)) during the child’s second year of life. As described, mothers’ responses to the food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) concerned dietary food recall during the time of conception, and responses were converted to glycemic index and glycemic loading values by Nutrition Quest (www.nutritionquest.com, accessed on 26 January 2013).  2.2. Child Behavioral Assessment  The details of how we assessed behavioral outcomes have been listed in full in [3].",7f70a3ec-0cb7-41a4-b4b9-a18d6f098a7d
1,methods1," In brief, the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) [12] was administered by caregivers or staff for children between 12 and 24 months of age (mean = 13.9) during a Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST) follow-up visit. The Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) has been validated and heavily used to assess child temperament in children as young as 11 months of age with excellent inter-rater and test–retest reliability [12,13]. The scoring of the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) scales consists of 0 = Not True/Rarely, 1 = Somewhat, and 2 = Very True/Often, and the instrument uses over 160 questions to assess childhood temperament in broad categories for externalizing, internalizing, dysregulation, competency-related, maladaptive, atypical and social-relatedness behaviors.",815ff2f6-b5d7-4d3a-9f9a-6c0081196225
2,methods2," Competency-related domains and the social-relatedness category are considered favorable outcomes with an increased score, while all others are considered adverse with an increased score. The problem and competency portions of the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) are also grouped into a composite autism spectrum disorder (autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) category [14]. As before, Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) behavioral scores were broken into tertiles and assessed using ordinal logistic regression for associations with maternal diet, and the peer-aggression subscale of Externalization behaviors was not assessed due to extremely limited nonzero scoring (>2/3 data = zero; data not shown) [3].  2.3.",6340dbc1-4950-4876-a65d-b05eacef4a61
3,methods3," Glycemic Loading  Pregnant women’s glycemic load was calculated from a food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) completed after enrollment concerning eating habits around their last menstrual period (University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center Nutrition and Lifestyle Core Questionnaire 2008 v.2; modified block questionnaire with additional foods added concerning southeastern eating habits). The questionnaire includes hundreds of data points concerning intake and dosing of supplements and vitamins, followed by extensive questions of fast-food intake and food types. Serving size (denoted with example pictures) and frequency were collected. For example, regarding consumption of chips, questions include frequency per day/week/month/year, and what size bag (snack bag size/grab bag size/½ family size bag). When asking about hamburgers, color photos depicting 5 grades of cooked (rare to well done) are provided.",6ccf722f-43b0-4916-9269-4b0adb62b0a4
4,methods4," When asking about cereals, color pictures of bowls with different serving sizes are depicted. Data from these surveys were converted to intakes of foods, food groups (i.e., carbohydrates), energy, and nutrients by Nutrition Quest [3].  Glycemic loading for a given food is calculated by the following: Glycemic Loadfood = (Glycemic Indexfood × Available Carbohydratefood per serving)/100. This value is multiplied by the frequency of consumption, and the total glycemic load is the sum of the values from all food [15,16,17]. The total glycemic load score was divided into tertiles (referent = first tertile) and used to assess associations of periconceptional maternal glycemic load with child behaviors.  Glycemic loading provides additional information when compared to the glycemic index in that glycemic load also considers the available amount of carbohydrates in a serving of the food consumed—the outcome being a more informative assessment of how food impacts blood glucose level.",3a04e2f2-2ea1-476e-8f71-b0b8e4f68ad6
5,methods5," For example, a watermelon has a glycemic index of 72 (very high) but a glycemic load of 4 in 2 cups of fruit due to being composed primarily of water (90%). In contrast, a medium-baked russet potato has a slightly lower glycemic index of 63 but a much higher glycemic load of over 20.  2.4. DNA Methylation Assessment  Complete descriptions are the same as in [3]. In brief, 40 ng of bisulfite-treated DNA was used to assess 48 CpG sites across 8 differentially methylated regions (differentially methylated regions (DMR)s) by pyrosequencing for the following imprinted control regions: IGF2, H19, MEG3, MEG3-IG (regulates MEG3 and DKL1), NNAT, MEST, SGCE/PEG10, and PLAGL1. Complete descriptions of these regions, as well as assay conditions and quality control criteria, are found elsewhere [18,19,20,21].",e3b3f0d8-f5da-4738-949f-ec30557946f3
6,methods6," For the assessment of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) on methylation, the number of subjects with maternal dietary information, all covariates, and cord blood methylation varied.  There are relatively few imprint regulatory regions that have been empirically determined. These regions were chosen because they had previously been well characterized for their methylation status and because they contribute to the normal silencing of one of the two parental alleles for genes within the imprinted domain they regulate. They control the expression of multiple genes associated with a variety of human diseases and health conditions, including those involved in neurodevelopmental outcomes (Supplemental Table S1). Thus, ICRs in general, make good “candidate” areas to study the link between maternal exposures and offspring outcomes.",66eda03b-f99d-476e-a32a-794e24683fa4
7,methods7,"  The first n = 620 mothers recruited who consented to cord blood retrieval were the group assessed for methylation values in these regions. The overlap of those with mothers who had answered a food frequency questionnaire and for whom Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) was administered to offspring at the one-year follow-up numbered 142 and were the dyads used for examining associations of maternal diet with offspring methylation alterations in this analysis.  2.5. Statistical Analysis  We examined associations of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) on tertiles of child behavioral outcomes with ordinal logistic regression (using polr() from MASS package in R) and adjusted for age at delivery, education level (any college vs. none), prepregnancy obesity (BMI > 30 vs.",84a15399-f9a2-4f25-93a1-4f170c939e63
8,methods8," BMI < 30), race (white, black, Hispanic, other), smoking during pregnancy, any of gestational, type I or type II diabetes, daily intake of folate (diet plus supplements: <400 μg, 400–800 μg, >800 μg), daily fiber intake, daily energy intake, and any breastfeeding of at least 3 months. We also adjusted for child sex, child birth weight, full-term status (≥37 weeks gestation or not), parity (nulliparous vs. not), and age of Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) assessment. These analyses were repeated stratified by child sex.  To test whether previous findings on Mediterranean diet adherence (Mediterranean diet (MDA)) and the findings presented herein on maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) exhibited independent associations on offspring behavior, both dietary patterns were concurrently modeled as predictors for tertiles of behavioral outcomes using ordinal logistic regression while adjusting for the same covariates.",c4a47753-c316-4153-bc39-f5d80720f2cf
9,methods9," For assessment of maternal diet on offspring methylation, child age at Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) and breastfeeding status were removed as covariates.  All analyses were carried out using R version 4.1.0 (R Development Core Team. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Assessment of maternal glycemic load and mean percent methylation of CpGs was conducted with linear regression using lm() from the base R stats package. Where indicated, correction for multiple comparisons was performed by p.adjust() in base R using Benjamini–Hochberg methodology [22] while holding true discovery to 90% (FDR ≤ 10%) for each tertile assessed across 20 behavioral outcomes.  3. Results  Study demographics, covariate, and temperament distributions are unchanged from those reported in . In brief, of N = 325 mother/offspring dyads, 53.5% of offspring were male. Roughly 42% of mothers identified as white, 29% as black, and 22% as Hispanic.",537a0763-c3dd-4077-8b10-7eabb6731560
10,methods10," Full-term births (92%) were predominant, and first-child births represented 44% of offspring. Smoking mothers were few (11%). Mothers without at least some college education represented 37.5%. A minority of mothers were obese (24.5% with BMI ≥ 30). The average age of temperament assessment via the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) was 13.9 months. There were little differences in average height and weight at birth and average monthly gain in weight and height between birth and assessment of temperament with the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) instrument (Table 1).  3.1. Associations of Maternal Glycemic Loading Dietary Pattern with Offspring Behavior  We first examined associations between maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) at or near conception with childhood social–emotional behaviors across all 325 dyads while adjusting for child sex.",76cfa2d3-8dbe-4b11-a171-a4387d626a20
11,methods11," Using the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA)) among offspring between 12 and 24 months of age and using the lowest maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) tertile as the referent, offspring born to mothers in the highest tertile, were more than 4 times more likely to be in a higher tertile of anxiety [OR (95% CI) = 4.51 (1.88, 11.07)] (Figure 1). Children born to mothers in the highest tertile of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) were also more likely to exhibit increased separation-related behaviors [OR (95% CI) = 2.34 (1.02, 5.40)], inhibition [OR (95% CI) = 3.42 (1.49, 7.96)], and maladaptive behaviors [2.91 (1.24, 6.94)]. Anxiety, inhibition, and maladaptive related associations were still significant when controlling false discovery ≤ 10%.",197b854e-8a78-4f49-b240-76ccfbda450e
12,methods12," These same trends were evident in a GL dose–response manner even when comparing the middle tertile of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) to the referent (lowest), but only anxiety-related behaviors were significant [OR (95% CI) = 2.11 (1.11, 4.07)] (Figure 1).  As the type of daycare can affect child neurodevelopment and temperament, we conducted a sensitivity analysis for the smaller subset of mothers who responded to any type of daycare questions and separated respondents who reported center-based daycare versus other types of daycare (yes = 55, other = 144). Including center-based daycare in the sex-adjusted models (Figure 1) resulted in attenuation of the estimate of anxiety when comparing offspring of mothers in the middle tertile of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) vs. referent (T2 vs. T1) [OR (95% CI) = 1.74 (0.77, 3.",5c883d94-5f8f-4149-8758-cf35c67d3ce0

Estimates for the likelihood of children born of mothers in T3 versus T1 of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) to exhibit an increased risk of separation behaviors were no longer significant but materially unchanged [OR (95% CI) = 2.83 (0.94, 8.67)], while for T2 versus T1 mothers, they became significant and were materially unchanged [OR (95% CI) = 2.32 (1.05, 5.20)]. The estimate of inhibition-related behaviors in offspring of T3 vs. T1 of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) was also materially unchanged [OR (95% CI) = 3.94 (1.31, 12.38)]. Interestingly, including this daycare-related variable in the model increased the odds of a child born to mothers in the T3 vs.",c98afcda-d985-403b-aec2-1383605472f9

Lastly, the estimate for the association of maladaptive behaviors in offspring of mothers in T3 vs. T1 of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) was also attenuated [OR (95% CI) = 1.91 (0.6, 6.13)] and no longer significant when adjusting for center-based daycare.  3.2. Associations of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) Dietary Pattern with Offspring Behavior by Sex  We next examined associations of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) on offspring behavioral outcomes by sex of the child. Anxiety [OR (95% CI) = 3.21 (1.28, 8.",4b551084-6765-4c29-9970-7d583de31a64
15,methods15,"31)] was more likely among male offspring of mothers in the middle maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) tertile, compared to the lowest tertile. In females, separation [OR (95% CI) = 2.92 (1.09, 8.14)] was more likely, while mastery [OR (95% CI) = 0.30 (0.10, 0.84)] and prosocial [OR (95% CI) = 0.32 (0.10, 0.97)] behaviors (both favorably scaled) were less likely (Figure 2). Although dose–response patterns of association were apparent, none of these associations survived correction for false discovery.  When examining associations of the highest tertile of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) to lowest with sex-stratified child behavioral outcomes, males had increased odds of being in the next highest tertile of impulsive behaviors [OR (95% CI) = 5.55 (1.76, 18.33)], anxiety [OR (95% CI) = 4.41 (1.33, 15.30)], sleep dysregulation [OR (95% CI) = 4.14 (1.34, 13.16)], empathy [OR (95% CI) = 6.68 (1.95, 24.",42ad67d7-6831-4a32-b69e-ef5b38794519
16,methods16,"40)], and maladaptive behaviors [OR (95% CI) = 9.86 (2.81, 37.18)] (Figure 3). All of these were still significant while limiting FDR to 10% or less. Among female offspring, there was an increased odds of being in the next highest tertile of anxiety-related behaviors [OR (95% CI) = 15.02 (3.14, 84.27)] and inhibition-related behaviors [OR (95% CI) = 5.28 (1.27, 23.39)] with the former surviving FDR correction (Figure 3).  3.3. Imprinted Control Regions (ICRs) for Nine Imprinted Genes and Multiple CpGs  To test mediation effects of methylation of control regions of imprinted genes on the association between maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) and offspring behavior we examined the relationship of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) on CpG methylation of differentially methylated regions (differentially methylated regions (DMR)) regulating nine imprinted genes.",d4f54c8f-6af8-428c-bb1c-25a6db2fcb9a
17,methods17," The mean methylation percentage of CpGs of the differentially methylated regions (DMR)s of the imprinted genes, SGCE/PEG10, PLAGL1, PEG3, NNAT, MEST, MEG3 IG, MEG3, IGF2, and H19, was assessed with a covariate-adjusted multiple linear regression. These data were stratified by sex. In males, a maternal diet with the highest tertile of glycemic loading was associated with an increase in mean methylation of the ICR of SGCE/PEG10 [β (95% CI) = 1.38 (0.05, 2.71); p-value = 0.043] (Figure 4).  3.4. Associations of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) on Offspring Behaviors While Adjusting for Maternal Mediterranean Dietary Pattern  Among our 325 mothers, maternal adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern and maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) were inversely correlated (rho = −0.37), consistent with one dietary pattern partially substituted for another.",27f20b00-eb12-4615-87c1-f1f175f538fe
18,methods18," To assess whether these reported adverse effects on child behavior were due to maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) or perhaps explained by a commensurate lack of Mediterranean dietary adherence (Mediterranean diet (MDA)), we concurrently modeled both maternal dietary patterns adjusting for the same covariates (Figure 5).  In nearly all cases, the observed behavioral associations for maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) persisted. Just as strikingly, significant associations reported on the Mediterranean dietary pattern also persisted when concurrently modeled with maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) (Figure 5), suggesting that associations of offspring behaviors with these two inversely correlated maternal dietary patterns are largely independent of each other.",a0ab69e2-b79a-42c6-aeca-49556ced2fa8
19,methods19," When jointly modeling maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) and maternal adherence to a Mediterranean diet, and using the lowest maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) tertile as the referent, offspring born to mothers in the highest maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) tertile were more likely to score in the highest tertile of impulsivity [OR (95% CI) = 2.73 (1.17, 6.44)], anxiety [OR (95% CI) = 3.93 (1.61, 9.81)], separation [OR (95% CI) = 2.55 (1.09, 6.01)], inhibition [OR (95% CI) = 3.55 (1.54, 8.37)], and maladaptive behaviors [OR (95% CI) = 2.77 (1.14, 6.81)].  Sex differences were also pronounced between maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) and childhood behaviors.",7ec666d3-af31-466d-af93-5e6a9fda21f5
20,methods20," In male offspring (Figure S1), when comparing the lowest maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) tertile and the highest tertile, there was an increased likelihood in impulsivity [OR (95% CI) = 6.77 (2.08, 23.25)], and anxiety [OR (95% CI) = 3.60 (1.05, 12.87)]. Among dysregulation behaviors, a similar association was observed between sleep [OR (95% CI) = 4.51 (1.43, 14.77)] and maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL). Offspring born to mothers in the highest maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) tertile were more likely to score in the highest tertile of maladaptive behaviors [OR (95% CI) = 10.47 (2.87, 41.36)] but also empathy [OR (95% CI) = 5.76 (1.66, 21.36)] (Figure S1).",5d9bca47-88c7-47a7-be65-128d48d3cee5

22,methods22," Discussion  We tested the hypothesis that a periconceptional diet marked by high glycemic loading would affect aspects of offspring neurodevelopment and temperament, and further examined whether associations between maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) and offspring temperament may be mediated by dysregulation of genomic imprinting in offspring, detectable at birth in cord-blood. In this analysis, using data from the Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST) cohort, we observed marked differences in child temperament scores in relation to maternal diet around the time of conception.",ac056068-1fc9-4a6b-a963-f40f1623f3fa
23,methods23," When examining the highest tertile of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) to the lowest, and after adjusting for an FDR of 10% or less, these associations of offspring behavior patterns with maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) were largely adverse with the exception of male children more likely to express greater empathy when the maternal diet was characterized by the highest levels of glycemic loading. Males also had a greater risk of impulsivity, anxiety, maladaptive behaviors, and sleeping issues. Female children expressed an increased risk of anxiety.",09b65d21-5109-4fce-96cb-53aa82d4b36f
24,methods24," When examined jointly in the context of a “healthy” maternal Mediterranean diet, previously reported favorable associations with offspring temperament persisted, as did adverse associations with maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) and offspring temperament, indicating these dietary associations with offspring behavioral patterns were largely independent of each other.  When we tested whether maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) was associated with changes in methylation of CpG’s of nine imprint control regions, the results were largely null except for hypermethylation of the CpGs in the SGCE/PEG10 ICR in males, and these associations did not survive FDR correction. This gene cluster has primarily been associated with proper placental development and cancer [23,24,25,26], but previous work has also implicated hypermethylation of PEG10 with increased offspring weight for length ratios [27].",7ab139d7-67e4-4527-ac49-beb05a3fcfd6
25,methods25," Further, the SGCE/PEG10 ICR has been implicated in Silver–Russell syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by improper development of facial features, growth retardation, and developmental delays in speech and motor function [28].  The Generation R cohort, a study of maternal diet and offspring temperament, reported an increase in externalizing behaviors with a maternal diet high in meat, margarine, and potatoes [8]. Multiple animal studies support that maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) can affect offspring neurodevelopment and temperament. Dam rats fed a high sucrose diet during pregnancy had offspring with a decreased brain-to-body-weight ratios, decreased performance on the Morris water maze, and exhibited gene-expression perturbations in the hippocampus, compared to offspring of dams fed standard chow [29].",a8ad1e69-0751-4f72-b362-02e423396bad
26,methods26," In an animal model used to study autism spectrum disorder (ASD), mice dams fed a ketogenic diet (extremely low maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL)) had offspring with ameliorated autism spectrum disorder (ASD) behaviors [30]. We reported a greater than fourfold increase in the odds of males born to mothers with the highest tertile of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) being in the next tertile of anxiety-related temperament. An animal study with rats reported similar results from dams fed with excessive caloric intake. Male offspring of such dams also exhibited increased anxiety [31].  Glycemic load describes both the impact a food item containing carbohydrates has on postprandial glucose or blood glucose and insulin levels after consumption and the amount of that food actually consumed (i.e., serving of carbohydrates consumed).",5d081801-7346-4936-aba9-3d5fb213ceb6
27,methods27," This quantification of the impact of carbohydrate-rich foods on blood glucose differs from the glycemic index in that the glycemic index measure ranks foods from 1 to 100. The ranking of foods is calculated with the following formula: incremental area under the curve for blood glucose after consumption of carbohydrate-containing food divided by the incremental area under the curve of a reference food containing the same amount of carbohydrate [17]. Foods with low glycemic indices have lower ranks, and foods with high glycemic indices have higher rankings. Glycemic loads provide additional information when compared to the glycemic index in that glycemic load also considers the available amount of carbohydrates in a serving of the food consumed—the outcome being a more informative assessment of how a food impacts blood glucose levels and subsequent insulin signaling.  Girchenko et al.",0e22df05-a301-402f-b4cc-edabaf3a8f4c
28,methods28," reported mediation effects from maternal antenatal inflammatory markers on associations of environmental diversities with child developmental delay [32]. A possible mechanism for the associations we found between maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) and offspring temperament may be related to inflammation from a persistent high glycemic load diet. It may be that the long-term effects of a diet characterized by a high-glycemic load and the corresponding inflammation from persistent excessive insulin signaling provide a partial mechanism in explaining these associations. Similarly, recent work by Polanska et al. examined diets in n = 11,870 mother/child dyads across four European cohorts and reported associations of adverse offspring emotional and behavioral symptoms with maternal low-quality and proinflammatory diets [33].",87eaab8d-db58-41da-8822-7e0ecf3b89ce
29,methods29," Aside from DNA methylation, other types of epigenetic alterations such as histone modifications and placental micro-RNA expression have been both inheritably altered in response to aging, diet, and environmental exposures [34].  Our findings should be interpreted in the context of our study limitations. For example, while our study is adequately powered to evaluate associations between maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) and neurodevelopmental outcomes, we are underpowered to evaluate sex-specific effects. Despite this limitation, multiple sex-specific findings were significant even after limiting FDR to 10%. In addition, we were unable to ascertain if offspring diet affected or moderated the reported associations between mother’s diet and offspring behavior, although due to the mean age at assessment (~14 months), food intakes are less likely to have diverged.",ad1ec754-7ef6-4b84-bdb2-6a2a5b786c95
30,methods30," Another limitation is that while the use of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to estimate maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) is established, early pregnancy is a time of dynamic dietary changes over very short time periods, and we cannot exclude the possibility that under-reporting of maternal periconceptional diet characterized by high glycemic loading (MGL) may have influenced our findings. It is critical to point out that mothers were asked to recall their diet at and around the time of conception, to capture extant diet prior to or as early as possible in pregnancy, and prior to dietary changes due to pregnancy. It has been proposed that future studies augment dietary assessments with tools such as Veggie meters® that estimate fruit and vegetable, to reduce misclassification.",1aba3d19-1178-4f21-bf18-49e4d6c49b1c
31,methods31,"  Our analysis supports the need for further investigation of the association between maternal (and offspring) diets characterized by high glycemic loading and neurocognitive behaviors, specifically examining sex differences. Sex-specific neurodevelopment outcomes related to other prenatal exposures, such as maternal anxiety, depression, or stress during pregnancy have been noted in other research [33,35], and a number of preclinical studies of prenatal exposure have resulted in sexual dimorphic developmental outcomes [36,37]. These differences could reflect sex-specific placental adaptation to variation in prenatal exposures, such as nutritional quality, and/or differences in neurodevelopmental trajectories between males and females. They may also reflect issues related to measurement and reporter biases; thus, studies examining sex differences would be prudent to ascertain assessments by other reporters besides the mother.",e08a9965-2a54-4c36-957b-4ba52fefb543
32,methods32," With these limitations in mind, our results suggest that during pregnancy, maternal diets characterized by high glycemic loading may promote poor neurocognitive functioning among boys. Although our findings were not significant for the association of increased IGF2 methylation from a high glycemic loading maternal diet, the direction of effect (in male offspring) was the same as in previous findings, highlighting an increase in IGF2 methylation due to an unhealthy maternal diet during gestation (not postnatal) [11]. Furthermore, it appears favorable offspring behaviors associated with maternal adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern in and around conception are independent of the adverse offspring outcomes reported in this work from a maternal diet high in glycemic loading. In total, these data highlight both the importance of maternal diet on offspring temperament and the need for future larger studies to elucidate further epigenetic mechanisms.
