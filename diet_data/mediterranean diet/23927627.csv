0,background0,"Over the last three decades, there has been a documented increase in the prevalence of pediatric obesity worldwide [1]. In Mexico, the 2006 National Survey of Health and Nutrition reported a 26.8% combined prevalence of overweight and obese children aged 5 to 11. In 2012, the national combined prevalence of overweight and obese children aged 5 to 11 was 34.4% (19.8 and 14.6%, respectively), whereas 35% of adolescents were overweight or obese [2].  As previously reported, the predicting factors that are most tightly linked to metabolic syndrome (MetS) are obesity and insulin resistance (IR). A study reported that 90% of obese adolescents present with at least one MetS component, whereas 30% meet all MetS criteria [3], including abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia (increase in triglycerides [TG] and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C] levels), high blood pressure and glucose intolerance [4,5].",c7b2adcb-7928-4d90-bf61-a12c4c868ce6
1,background1," The importance and interest in MetS lies in its association with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary heart disease, and increased mortality, even in subjects without T2DM [6].  The beneficial effects of poly- and monounsaturated fats on the recommended indexes for omega-3 (ω3) have been determined to result in decreased obesity and IR [7]. Additionally, the association between the glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) with Homeostatic Model Assessment of IR index (HOMA-IR) has been established, as well as the prevalence of MetS when foods with a high GI are consumed. The beneficial effect of high-fiber cereals and whole grains has also been demonstrated [8].  A diet rich in soluble fiber (20 g/1000 kcal) and low in polyunsaturated fats (20% of total calories) and a decreased consumption of food items with a high GI, can decrease the prevalence of MetS by improving blood pressure (BP) and IR [9,10]. Weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and decreases visceral fat content.",c808d1fb-2c28-41f8-aca1-73fb4850e23c
2,background2," The level of oxidative stress is increased in patients with MetS, causing an endogenous and exogenous depletion of antioxidant reserves. Patients with MetS do not consume enough fruit and vegetables, so it is necessary to increase their intake to meet vitamin C and carotenoid quotas [11].  Over the last few decades, the Mediterranean diet has been shown to decrease cardiovascular events and increase life expectancy in adult populations [12-14].  Similarly, it has been shown to efficiently decrease MetS by 20-43%, regardless of age, sex, physical activity, lipid levels, and BP [15]. This type of diet characteristically uses olive oil, both as a dressing and to cook food, and contains fish, wheat, olives, and grapes [16,17].  The beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet have been proven. Similarly, in combination with dried fruits, its main component, olive oil, has been shown to decrease total cholesterol (TC) and TG levels [18,19].",c5d638c3-c0a5-46c1-bca6-4226c9e2c9aa
3,background3,"  The effect of a Mediterranean-style diet (Mediterranean style diet (MSD)) has not been extensively assessed in pediatric populations presenting with cardiovascular risk factors. Thus, the objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy of nutritional therapy using an Mediterranean style diet (MSD) to decrease MetS indicators in obese children and adolescents.

4,methods0,"An open-label study was conducted in 49 children and adolescents attending the family medicine unit at the Mexican Social Security Institute. The subjects were selected from a multicentric study in Mexico called “Prevention and early treatment of T2D in a pediatric population”. Subjects meeting the following criteria were selected: Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) ≥95th percentile and any MetS component, according to modified International Diabetes Federation (International Diabetes Federation (IDF)) criteria for children and adolescents; waist circumference (WC) ≥90th percentile; fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL; TG ≥150 mg/dL; HDL-C ≤ 40 mg/dL; systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) ≥130 mmHg and/ or diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) ≥85 mmHg [20].",c1193987-a1a0-4f22-b318-46dc256f3d45

This research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, 59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008 for research involving human subjects. Ethical approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee at the Carlos Macgregor Sanchez Navarro Hospital, Mexico City. Written consent was provided by all participants and their parents before enrollment.  Clinical history was obtained and a complete examination was carried out for all participants. The presence of acanthosis nigricans in the neck and armpits was assessed.",b8561c1b-9ec3-4d32-bf53-b26f770c1b15
6,methods2," systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured three times with a 5 min interval between measurements, with the patient having remained seated for more than 5 min. The arterial pressure value was determined from the average of the last two measurements. Anthropometric measurements were recorded by nutritionists and standardized using the Habicht method according to the specifications recommended by Lohman et al. [21,22].  Weight and height were measured using a TANITA™ scale (model TBF-215), which provides information on fat percentage, fat mass, and lean body mass in kilograms using bioelectrical impedance of the lower segments. WC was measured after determining the midpoint between the last rib and the upper edge of the iliac crest on the right-hand side. Hip circumference was determined at the widest point of the trochanters.",f2c5122a-63e0-4398-ac28-2e10d7cfad58
7,methods3," Both measurements were taken three times, and the average values of the second and third measurements were used for the analysis.  TC and TG concentrations were measured by enzymatic methods. HDL-C was quantified after precipitation of lipoproteins containing apoB with phosphotungstate/Mg2+; low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were estimated using the Friedewald formula as modified by DeLong et al. [23]. HOMA-IR was calculated as the product of the fasting plasma insulin level in microunits and the fasting plasma glucose level in millimoles per liter, divided by 22.5 [24].  Using a radioimmunoanalysis method, glucose and insulin levels were determined while fasting, and 2 hours after the administration of an oral load of 1. 75 g of hydric glucose per kg of body weight, (maximal dose of 75 g). All biochemical indicators, except for post-load glucose and insulin levels, were measured again after 16-week follow-up.",ab9b31f6-9ea6-4157-bb07-5c760b58b0cc
8,methods4,"  Prior to the start of both diets, the patients and their families were trained how to build a healthy menu based on rations and equivalents. Food replicas were used for instruction and the main food groups included fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy, cereals, legumes, and fats.  Following the first month of instruction, 24 children and adolescents received the Mediterranean-style diet (Mediterranean style diet (MSD)) and 25 received the standard diet. The Schofield equation was used for dietary calculations in children aged 3–10 and adolescents aged 10–18. The food received by the standard diet group was distributed with 55-60% of carbohydrates (45-50% complex and no more than 10% refined and processed sugars), 25-30% lipids, and 15% proteins. In accordance with the calories corresponding to them, each patient was encouraged to consume fresh fruit and vegetables, while any dairy products and products of animal origin should be low in fat.",3b0cbd0d-b4d6-49c7-815a-b3bfc47733c0
9,methods5," It was recommended that they limit their consumption of fried food, while the consumption of steamed foods was encouraged. It was suggested that eating times be respected and that food should preferably be consumed at home. It was also suggested that the consumption of fast food be limited to once a month or less. The consumption of sugary drinks and packaged juices was limited, while the consumption of natural water was encouraged along with drinks prepared using fruit but no added sugar. As well as receiving the aforementioned recommendations, the Mediterranean style diet (MSD) group also received the following specific indications regarding distribution: 60% carbohydrates (50% complex and no more than 10% refined and processed sugars), 25% lipids, and 15% proteins.",fb7c9482-226b-41e5-863e-979a998e21ac

11,methods7," The Mediterranean style diet (MSD) group received specific menus including the aforementioned food items. To determine the participants’ typical diet prior to the intervention, a 24-hour recalls was used.  In both groups the diet was administered using a food equivalents system.  For this purpose, food replicas were used so that patients and their parents/guardians could learn to recognize a healthy diet, and menus were tailored according to the age- and gender-required calories of each participant. The patients received their diet plans in writing, containing a graphic representation of the food groups, menu prototypes and general recommendations for healthy nutrition.  The calorie content prior to and after the intervention was calculated using the computer software NUTRIPAC, which was validated in Mexico and contains Hispanic food data [25,26].",77727a1f-8af5-46df-b3f5-7e9dd955caca
12,methods8," Using this software, the calorie content as well as the macro- and micronutrient content of the diets of the intervened patients was determined based on their 24-hour recalls entries.  Both groups received general recommendations about performing physical activity.  Patients were evaluated every three weeks over the intervention to measure diet compliance and reinforce the indicated diet. For this purpose, 24-hour recalls were used. During the consultations, doubts about the indicated diet were resolved, the principles of the intervention were reinforced, barriers/difficulties were discussed, and specific suggestions for better diet compliance were made.  Using the aforementioned technique, measurements were registered during each visit for the following parameters: body composition, dietary assessment, waist and hip circumference measurements, and BP.",6491db6f-6508-4af5-8a40-897f8b7e5ac3
13,methods9,"  Paired Student’s t-test was used for dependent samples to compare the effect of the intervention on the anthropometric, biochemical, and dietary variables in both groups.

19,discussion0,"The results of the present study demonstrate the effect of a nutritional intervention with an Mediterranean style diet (MSD) in obese children exhibiting at least one MetS component. The benefits of a Mediterranean diet on health, cardiovascular disease prevention, and other aliments have been shown in adult populations [27,28]. The characteristics of our study participants, who were obese and exhibited at least one cardiovascular risk factor, made them ideal candidates for the implementation of a diet aimed at decreasing these factors. The intervention consisted of the administration of a nutrition plan containing foods that are part of a Mediterranean diet.  Although the benefit of a Mediterranean diet in adults is widely recognized, little is known about its effect in children. Studies have reported an association between diet compliance and obesity prevalence in children and adolescent populations [29].",1c0a264f-4fff-4f98-800c-4b9c602d9767
20,discussion1,"  Even though adherence to the Mediterranean diet is important, other factors also influence obesity prevention, such as eating habits, customs, and physical exercise [30]. Thus, it is necessary to strengthen adherence to the Mediterranean diet while also addressing other factors that contribute to obesity and metabolic alterations.  After a 16-week intervention, the Mediterranean style diet (MSD) group decreased Body Mass Index (BMI) but without changes in weight. Lopez Alarcon et al., who conducted an intervention study supplementing 900 mg omega 3 fatty acids to a population aged 9 to 18 years, they reported not changes in weight or Body Mass Index (BMI) [31]. Similarly Fernandez et al., who compared three different diets over a three-month period in an adult population and did not observe an association between body weight and the Mediterranean diet [32].",b67abd71-6dd5-4fd8-9def-b853727b217d
21,discussion2," Although the Mediterranean style diet (MSD) had no significant effect on body weight after four months of intervention, a decrease in Body Mass Index (BMI) and an increase in height were observed. The nutrition plan was administered according to weight, sex, age, and eating habits and was not intended to be a weight reductive treatment. This could explain why the population did not experience any weight loss. On the contrary, the standard diet group increased 1.7 kg average, with no effect on the Body Mass Index (BMI), possibly due to the height increase.  It could be explained by the dietetic patterns, the lack of physical activity, and the sedentary behavior of studied subjects. Our results agree with those that have reported nutritional and physical activity and motivational interviewing training interventions in similar populations [33,34].",a8e73e15-de64-4946-811a-1bb8ad2f89c3
22,discussion3,"  Abdominal obesity was measured by WC, which has been reported to be a strong indicator of cardiometabolic risk in children and adolescents [35,36]. We did not observe a significant change in this indicator at the end of the intervention. It has been reported that higher scores for diet compliance are inversely associated with WC and waist-height ratio in young populations [37]. We measured body composition using bioelectrical impedance and did observe significant differences in the reduction of fat mass and lean mass in the group with Mediterranean style diet (MSD). Changes in these indicators have been reported in the Mediterranean diet adherence [38].  High BP levels are an important component of MetS. A total of 4 patients with high BP levels were identified at the beginning of the study.",21e2dd5e-f9ca-419b-8ff3-cabedee29f30
23,discussion4," No significant changes in the average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values were found, unlike what has been reported previously for young populations following the Mediterranean diet, albeit with higher compliance rates [39]. One possible explanation could be that our study population already exhibited age- and sex-appropriate BP values.  Although the development of T2DM is still more common in adults, an increase in this disease has been reported in children and adolescents [40]. Although genetic factors predispose individuals to the development of diabetes, obesity, lifestyle, poor living conditions, and social factors further contribute to it [41]. In Mexico, a 0.6% prevalence of diabetes in the pediatric population has been reported, which further increases to 1.3% in obese children [42].",a4209802-6858-4b22-9c97-8d4f5415766f
24,discussion5," In our study population, 8 participants receiving the Mediterranean style diet (MSD) and 14 participants receiving the standard diet presented with glucose values greater than 100 mg/dL. This is consistent with previous reports that obesity continues to be a determining factor in fasting glucose alterations and IR [43].  In the present study, we observed a decrease in fasting glucose levels in both intervention groups. However, the Mediterranean style diet (MSD) group exhibited the most significant decrease. A reduction in simple sugar consumption was suggested for both diets; thus, a possible explanation for this observation could be that the Mediterranean style diet (MSD) group had a higher fiber content, which could have a greater influence on reducing glucose levels. Furthermore, 65% of the total assessed population presented with IR, assessed by HOMA-IR >3, which is similar to what has been previously reported by other groups [44].",133fca5c-bf69-41c2-b83e-a61e9f6c722d
25,discussion6," Importantly, an inadequate lifestyle leads to a higher risk of developing T2DM.  The results of the current study demonstrated that Mediterranean style diet (MSD) decrease CT, TG and LDL-C levels and also increase HDL-C after the 16-week. Similar results have been previously reported in obese children and adolescents following a hypocaloric diet low in simple carbohydrates and high in vegetables and fiber-rich cereals [43]. Other authors have reported in children with hypercholesterolemia decrease in TC and LDL-C levels with a Mediterranean diet [45].  The results are relevant in regard to these indicators, given that alterations in the lipid profile are recognized as an important factor in cardiovascular risk among the overweight and obese pediatric population [44]. In the standard diet group no significant changes were observed in lipid profile.",cc14c761-4817-4be9-bc13-5d48bee0e8f3
26,discussion7,"  One of the characteristics of the administered Mediterranean style diet (MSD) was its high fiber content, which is most likely responsible for the reduction in glucose and lipid levels, as mentioned previously [46]. Similar effects on metabolic indicators have been reported for pre-diabetic Mexican adults following a diet with a 50% reduction in carbohydrates and higher fruit, vegetable, and fiber content [47] The fiber consumption in the Mediterranean style diet (MSD) group was greater than 16 g. This is similar to the value reported for a population on a diet with many food items typical of a Mediterranean diet [48]. The Mediterranean style diet (MSD) group increased significantly the fiber consumption, this is beneficial, since it has been reported the association between a low fiber diet and higher adiposity and cardiovascular risk factors during childhood and adolescence [49,50].",c986022b-93e8-434d-9c9c-68d8f29364fa
27,discussion8," Another benefit of the Mediterranean style diet (MSD) was the increased protein intake, this is relevant because these nutrients are essential for a healthy growth and development in this population.  One characteristic of the Mediterranean style diet (MSD) in this study was the greater consumption of antioxidants, such as selenium, vitamins C and E, dietary fiber and few simple sugars, this could explain that Mediterranean style diet (MSD) group exhibited a higher significantly average consumption of omega 9 fatty acids, dietary fiber and less consumption of SFA, different to what we found in the standard diet group.  Mediterranean style diet (MSD) diet group exhibited important benefits in reducing several MetS components, which is consistent with the decrease in metabolic risk indicators reported in women following a diet supplemented with antioxidants [51]. MetS was identified in a significant proportion of both groups.",69245501-65c2-44b5-afd2-b0bda31f68f8
28,discussion9," However, at the end of the intervention, the Mediterranean style diet (MSD) group showed a significantly reduced proportion of patients exhibiting MetS in regard to the basal metabolic rate. As previously reported, our results support the usefulness of providing children exhibiting obesity and MetS with an Mediterranean style diet (MSD) aimed at increasing consumption of fiber, proteins, omega 3 and omega 9 fatty acids, zinc, selenium, vitamin E and flavonoids [15].  These results further support the importance of introducing an Mediterranean style diet (MSD) to at-risk populations. In addition, a healthy lifestyle, adequate eating habits, and physical activity should be encouraged, while less time should be spent watching TV, working at the computer, and playing video games. A lack of physical activity has been reported to be a major predicting factor of childhood obesity, superseding compliance with a Mediterranean diet [52].",ff4838d7-8e2a-4c02-b109-d8bb1dc462eb
29,discussion10," Physical activity was not evaluated in this study, both groups received general recommendations in this area. Future research should be carried out to evaluate the efficacy of combining a Mediterranean style diet (MSD) with physical activity in childhood obesity.  A limitation of our study was the short intervention time, thus, the sustainability of longer intervention time should be assessed. We also consider that this strategy should be evaluated with a larger number of participants to adjust the effect by variables such as age, socioeconomic status, physical activity and sedentary status. Our results suggest that in the Mexican population, a longer intervention time with an Mediterranean style diet (MSD), together with lifestyle modifications could have a greater impact on the pediatric population exhibiting obesity and at least one MetS component.",a4c1cba3-21a1-4a34-ab85-a7d1130f267b
