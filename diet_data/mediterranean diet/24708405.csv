0,introduction0,"Obesity is one of the most common disorders worldwide, affecting individuals of all ages, races, sexes, social and cultural environments and providing the predisposition to a series of severe complications and co-morbidities, such as type II diabetes mellitus, hepatic steatosis, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, embolism, cancer [1-3]. There are three known types of genetic obesity – monogenic (syndromic) obesity, pleiotropic (syndromic) obesity and polygenic (common, multifactorial, non-syndromic) obesity [4-7]. While the syndromic obesity (monogenic and pleiotropic) is represented by rare, singled-out cases of complex genetic syndromes in which obesity is the or one of the main affections, caused by large gene or chromosome abnormalities, polygenic obesity stands for more than 80% of the cases worldwide, being by far the most common type [4,5,8].",49795e2c-85eb-4012-adb5-47dba8be6a2b
1,introduction1,"   Monogenic obesity is represented by genetic syndromes in which obesity is the central and most often sole clinical element, produced by mutations in a single gene which is involved in the hunger-satiety pathway [4,6,9]. Genetic approaches identified so far a number of single causal mutated genes of genetic obesity syndromes, the most frequently reported ones being leptin (leptin (LEP)), leptin receptor (leptin (LEP)-R), melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), proopiomelanocortin (proopiomelanocortin (POMC)), prolactin (prolactin (PRL)), Niemann-Pick disease type C1 gene (NPC1), V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog (musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog (MAF)), and others [8-10].  Pleiotropic obesity syndromes are complex multisystemic genetic disorders caused by complex multigene mutations or epigenetic modifications that do not obey to Mendelian rules, or even chromosomal alterations (deletions, translocations, duplications, inversions, etc.).",ba78aec6-17ee-44e2-bfdc-87436851e1a9
2,introduction2," These anomalies produce a series of clinical features, one of them being obesity. Examples of these types of syndromes are Prader-Willi syndrome (Prader Willi syndrome (PWS)), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS)), Albright hereditary osteodistrophy (PHP1A), Alstrom syndrome (Alstrom syndrome (ALMS)), Cohen syndrome (COH1), Fragile X syndrome (Fragile X syndrome (FXS)), Borjeson–Forssman–Lehmann syndrome (Borjeson–Forssman–Lehmann syndrome (BFLS)), Simpson-Golabi-Behmel type 2 syndrome (Borjeson–Forssman–Lehmann syndrome (BFLS)) and others. There have been more than 30 pleiotropic obesity syndromes described so far, all of them being rare genetic disorders [11,12].  The common type of obesity is nevertheless the polygenic one. Obesity is the result of an unbalance between the intake and expenditure of a genetic predisposition (produced by a number of gene variants) which may transform into the actual disease if the environmental factors are met.",f2b22e7f-1f08-4cfa-8fae-01ef83318e19
3,introduction3," There are a number of factors that may cause a predisposition to turn into obesity: behavioral, psychological, social, cultural, religious, geographic, etc. [3,4,13,14].   In 2007, the first gene described in association with the common obesity was the fat mass and obesity associated gene (fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO)) [15,16]. Since then, there have been over 60 chromosome locations with more than 240 gene polymorphisms identified of being correlated with a higher weight gain. Finding the genes and mutations responsible for the obesity pathogenesis has become the focal point of research for this disease, as they will describe, either the predisposition or the development of this disorder depending on the type of mutation and number of genes involved [14,17-20].  There are two types of studies in the genetic research of obesity – candidate gene studies and genome wide association studies (genome wide association studies (GWAS)).",11b78f84-ca72-4e5b-8af7-36af159f0865
4,introduction4," The candidate gene studies have been the first ones essayed and they aim at the monogenic types of obesity and partially at the pleiotropic types. The candidate gene studies identified leptin to be strongly correlated with obesity, however multiple other genes responsible for monogenic obesity syndromes have been described through candidate gene studies (proopiomelanocortin (POMC), leptin (LEP)-R, MC4R, prolactin (PRL), etc.) [8-10]. Presently, a map of genes causing obesity in pleiotropic syndromes (SNRPN gene for the obesity in Prader Willi syndrome (PWS), GNAS1 gene in PHP1A, Alstrom syndrome (ALMS)1 gene in Alstrom syndrome (ALMS), FMR1 gene in Fragile X syndrome (FXS), and others), has been established [11,12]. However, the candidate gene studies cannot determine the large number of genes and single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in the common type of obesity.",519657c0-3ba1-4084-b8dd-5aa4ce237dbb
5,introduction5,"  Genome-wide association studies can afford to approach at least a few hundred SNPs at a time and then correlate the findings to build gene association maps. As stated before, in the field of obesity, the first gene that proved to be correlated with the polygenic type was fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO).   Our research was centered on the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 gene polymorphism because the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) and MC4R genes are the most frequently associated causal markers of polygenic obesity, the rs9939609 SNP being the most commonly described in correlation with this disorder and different metabolic syndrome characteristics (obesity, Body Mass Index (BMI), abdominal circumference, weight, WHR (Waist/ Hip Ratio), body fat percentage) [18,19,21-25]. fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) mRNA is expressed in hypothalamic nuclei and is involved in energy balance regulation in mice [23-25].",bb4f0ad4-74ff-4d13-b77a-f429a0d4c928
6,introduction6," Recent studies indicate that the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) mRNA is highly regulated by fasting, feeding, eating behavior in general and environment, revealing an important link between the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) gene and its chromosome address (16q12.2) and the hunger sensation [23-26]. Intron 1 of the gene is the only one associated with obesity, multiple fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) gene variants being at that location which is correlated to this disorder: rs9939609, rs17817449, rs1421085, rs9930506, rs8050136, rs9751812, rs9751812 and other 25 validated SNPs [23-26].

17,discussion0,"fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 genotypes and mutant (A) allele frequencies  Out of the total of 53 subjects from both study groups, the homozygous wildtype (T/ T) genotype was identified in 15 individuals (28.3%), the heterozygous (T/ A) in 20 (37.7%) and the homozygous mutant (A/ A) in 18 (34%). The mutant A allele was identified in 38 of the 53 subjects (71.7%), 13.7% higher than reported for the Caucasian population (58%) [27], making the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 polymorphism a possible common gene variant for the Caucasian Romanian population, although the number of individuals in this study was not big enough for such assumptions. Our previous studies revealed high frequency rates for the mutant A allele both in adults (83.33%) and children (56.52%). The difference between these percentages may be an indicator that the A allele is more of an indicator for obesity in adults than in children for our Romanian cohort.",f3d00dce-bf3b-47ee-8a82-58bc5daa5071
18,discussion1,"   The extended frequency of the A allele is 56/ 106 alleles (52.83%), meaning that 56 out of the 106 subjects’ parents carried at least one mutant fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 allele which was passed on to their descendants. In this respect, the study of a number of obesity-affected families from our study groups was essayed with significant results on the inheritance of the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 obesity predisposition. However, the results of this study are yet to be published.  Study results and further management of the subjects  The results of our study revealed important links between the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) genetic predisposition for obesity and the development of the disorder itself. These findings suggested that this genetic predisposition may be kept under control only if it is known in due time (neo-/ postnatal) or if the lifestyle of the subjects includes high physical exercise and a constant diet.",c5f9d4de-3391-4ba3-9e94-ea983da5fe91
19,discussion2,"   A number of subjects included in the normal groups were discovered to carry the homozygous mutant (A/ A) fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) genotype, thus a high genetic obesity predisposition. However, given their lifestyles (professional athletes, individuals always concerned with their diet, army officers, etc.), it was easy to understand the lack of body fat excess against the highly expressed genetic marker. What should also be mentioned is that these respective subjects kept their lifestyles constant throughout all their lives and had no personal history of obesity whatsoever.  On the other hand, a number of subjects from the obese groups revealed a mutant wildtype (T/ T) genotype, presenting no fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 predisposition. This may mean that other genetic, obesity-related markers were present in these subjects producing the predisposition to develop obesity.",5bbe760a-5da7-4004-895f-3b1af4ea3e88
20,discussion3,"   Some of the adults in the obese group were retired professional athletes, who maintained an optimal physical shape during their professional careers, but after retirement, they rapidly developed severe obesity. The highest values of weight were obtained from individuals with this personal history. All these subjects were carrying at least 1 mutant (A) fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) allele but against their genetic predisposition, through intense physical exercise, they did not develop obesity while performing their professions. However, once the physical activity was reduced or mostly stopped and athletics-specific diet replaced with normal modern day alimentation, the genetic predisposition took over and cumulated with the increased caloric needs, and, due to the highly developed muscle system, generated severe obesity.",6c48995f-5104-462b-928c-c0dd1d0c06d2
21,discussion4,"  A number of studies highlighted the benefits of the Mediterranean diet plan in individuals carrying a genetic predisposition for developing obesity in general [28,29] or the specific fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) predisposition [30,31]. Indeed, part of the subjects referred to in the previous paragraph, were guided by the nutritionist to adopt the Mediterranean diet plan. The results were benefic and fast, after 6-months theses, the subjects losing between 47.15% and 66.75% of their body fat mass (19.8–51.1 kg, 70.37-89.56% of their excess body fat mass). However, with no exception, when the diet plan was stopped, diet cancelled and physical exercise reduced due to the normal sedentary modern lifestyle, all of these subjects gained back 14.7–43.2 kg in the same or smaller amount of time and the tendency for all of them was to gain more.",3562ceb7-a1c8-4d74-b516-2ecc3933b65a
22,discussion5,"  These cases came upon our knowledge to suggest that both the genetic predisposition and diet programmes are relevant when certain factors are met. The genetic obesity predisposition (fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 gene variant in this case) may develop into the disease but not necessarily. If the subjects are aware of their genetic inheritance and adopt specific proved diets or regular physical exercise they may cancel their predisposition and never develop obesity. However, diets and athletic activities are effective if maintained and included into the lifestyle of the individuals.   When performing the anamnesis, poor eating and sedentary behavior were the main causes of obesity in our subjects. Food selection is an important factor, as the speed of the modern day life rarely allows individuals to be able to carefully choose their food and have a constant meal plan.",fd1bac7e-9679-493b-bf18-dec151ffb68d
23,discussion6," Eating whatever, whenever, just to answer a sensation often misinterpreted as hunger, has given obesity the epidemic status. Hunger sensation comes as a reaction to the lack or need of energy (calories), but it may also be the result of emotional stress or usual behavior. Association studies are useful especially in these types of situations, when a great number of genetic markers are involved in giving the apparently same sensation – hunger. Understanding what makes us want to eat is an important piece in the signaling obesity puzzle; a piece we are yet to fully understand.   Conclusions 1. The rs9939609 polymorphism is a highly frequent gene variant in our study groups, with a high incidence of the mutant A allele.  2.",ca003b22-cbed-40a1-bc89-cf997932b493

No correlation has been found between the A allele and HDL-cholesterol, TSH, and transaminases levels – GOT (and transaminases levels – GOT (AST)) GPT (ALT) and and transaminases levels – GOT (AST) levels.  4. The A allele has been identified in statistical association with obesity-related disorders found in our subjects (altered glucose metabolism status, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic syndrome).  5. No association has been found between the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) genotypes and diabetes mellitus, hepatic steatosis and hypothyroidism in our groups.  6.",81cb7731-1368-459d-8a80-c332d7660d35
25,discussion8," However, the mutant fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) A allele was found more in correlation with obesity in adults than in children, both being statistically significant.  7. The genetic fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 obesity predisposition can be cancelled with constant life-long physical exercise and diet.  8. Mediterranean diet is useful in our Caucasian subjects to decrease the body fat mass as long as it is followed for a long period of time or as a lifestyle.  9. Eating behavior, poor meal selection, emotional stress are important causes of developing obesity in our subjects and setting them straight should be the starting point of every diet.  10. Genome wide association studies might create the links needed for clinicians to understand the full process of obesity development and hunger signaling in order to be able to adopt healthy screening programmes and suitable diet plans. =",45d98465-decf-4ae5-99dd-a0a2b271db2a
