0,background0," Although adherence to the Mediterranean and antioxidant-rich diets during pregnancy is suggested to improve maternal-fetal health by reducing oxidative stress, yet there is no study available.  Objective  We examined whether maternal dietary patterns in pregnancy impact the biomarkers of oxidative stress in mothers and their offspring. ",2aa2ec88-e61c-4cee-b84d-7c31f9982e60
1,methods0," Study population included 642 mothers and 335 newborns of the “Nutrition in Early Life and Asthma” (newborns of the “Nutrition in Early Life and Asthma” (NELA)) birth cohort. Maternal diet during pregnancy was assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire and a priori-defined dietary indices (relative Mediterranean Diet [rMED], alternative Mediterranean Diet [aMED], Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension [Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)], Alternate Healthy Index [Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI)], and Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI)-2010) were calculated. Biomarkers measured were: hydroperoxides, carbonyl groups, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG) determined in maternal blood and newborn cord blood, and urinary maternal and offspring 15-F2t-isoprostane. Multivariate linear regression models were performed.",eef45d87-24e5-4178-a42e-b40f4783ed7a
2,methods1,"   Study Design and Participants  The study population were the mother-child pairs of the Nutrition in Early Life and Asthma (newborns of the “Nutrition in Early Life and Asthma” (NELA)) study, a prospective population-based birth cohort set up between 2015 and 2018 in Murcia, a south-eastern Mediterranean region of Spain. The main objective of newborns of the “Nutrition in Early Life and Asthma” (NELA) is to unravel the developmental origins and mechanisms of asthma and allergy. The study protocol, recruiting methods, and data collection processes have been described elsewhere (18). Among the 1,350 women invited to participate, 738 (54%) were finally enrolled in the study. The selection of participants of the present study is presented in Supplementary Figure 1.  The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Virgen de la Arrixaca University Clinical Hospital in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki (report 9/14; 29/09/2014).",1bb4544b-4fb8-4b47-b3e7-cddf00fcc3f7
3,methods2," Written informed consents were obtained from parents at recruitment.  Maternal Dietary Intake Assessment and Dietary Patterns During Pregnancy  Information on the eating habits of pregnant women was collected at 20 weeks of gestation to estimate dietary intakes during that period using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) previously developed and validated for use among pregnant women living in Spain (19). The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) included 123 items, of which 112 were semi-quantitative and 11 qualitative to collect information about the use of supplements and organic food consumption. The intakes of nutrients and energy were estimated using the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Composition Tables (20), and as well as other published sources for Spanish foods, portion sizes, and their content for some specific nutrients, such as folic acid (21, 22).",6f8b5678-1baa-4205-b4be-1115a645b65d
4,methods3," The intake frequency for each food item was converted to the average daily intake for each participant. For the calculation of the different scores in each of the dietary patterns described below, the consumption of vitamin or mineral supplements by the mother during pregnancy was not considered.  Based on the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data, we calculated five of the most widely used a priori-defined dietary indexes that we have used previously (23): the relative Mediterranean Diet (rMED) and the alternative Mediterranean Diet (aMED) indices that are based on the Mediterranean dietary pattern; the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) index; and the Alternate Healthy Index (Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI)) and its version for evaluating chronic diseases (Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI)-2010), which are based on American dietary guides.",e7d52297-7eb7-4583-aa7c-f5ef65537883
5,methods4,"  The rMED and aMED indices are the versions of the original MD score developed by Trichopulou et al. (24). The rMED was constructed considering the consumption of eight components: vegetables, fruits and nuts, cereals, legumes, fish, olive oil, meat, and dairy products (25). To adapt to the score of pregnant women, the component on alcohol consumption was removed because the recommendation is to avoid alcohol consumption during pregnancy and most of the women in our cohort did not consume it. All the food groups were measured as grams per 1,000 kcal/day, and values were divided into tertiles. We assigned values of 0, 1, and 2 to the intake tertiles, positively scoring higher intakes for the 6 components that fit into the MD. The scoring was reversed for meat and dairy components presumed to not fit into the MD, thus positively scoring lower intakes. Scores were added for each component, up to a total score ranging from 0 to 16.",4ca0dfa0-da37-4d41-b52d-489680961a69
6,methods5," Differently from rMED, aMED considers red and processed meat and establishes the ratio of mono/polyunsaturated fats (26) and determines a score ranging from 0 to 8.  The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index was constructed based on the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) clinical trial in which dietary pattern rich in fruit, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products can substantially lower blood pressure (27). This a priori-defined index was described by Fung et al. in 2008 (28). The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index was constructed considering the consumption of eight components, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy, sodium, red and processed meats, and sweetened beverages.",ccd148de-b3c2-4b52-ac69-246b231dea95
7,methods6," We assigned values of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 to the intake quintiles, positively scoring higher intakes for all the components except for sodium, red and processed meats, and sweetened beverages which had a reverse scoring (positively scoring lower intakes). Scores were summed for each component, for a total score ranging 0–40.  The Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI) is an a priori dietary index that is based on the Healthy Eating Index, which was developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and considers the adherence to the food guide pyramid. The Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI) is a measure of diet quality that focuses on foods and macronutrients, such as assessment of unsaturated fats, associated with decreased chronic disease risk (29). Briefly, the Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI) consists of 9 items with a maximum possible score of 87.5.",97f23826-c45b-46e5-bd69-55691daa4b5e
8,methods7," Such items and their corresponding ideal intakes are as follows: vegetables (5 servings/day), fruit (4 servings/day), nuts and soy (1 serving/day), ratio of white meat (fish and poultry) to red meat (≥4:1), cereal fiber (15 g/day), trans fat ( ≤ 0.5% of energy), ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat (≥1), moderate alcohol intake (0.5–1.5 servings/day), and long-term multivitamin use (≥5 years of continuous use). To make the index more appropriate for our pregnant population, we excluded the “long-term multivitamin use” item because it is not a common practice in the Spanish population. Scores were summed for each component, for a total score ranging 0–80.  The Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI)-2010 index was designed in 2012 based on updated literature to study the relation between food intake and chronic diseases (30).",747a30db-cb4f-45fa-a37b-63a5c349288a
9,methods8," The Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI)-2010 scores 11 components for a total of 110 points, such as whole grains intake (specific for women), legumes and nuts, red/processed meat ratio, sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juices, sodium, and polyunsaturated fats.  Definition of the scoring system, number of components, total score, and components of dietary scores are presented in Supplementary Table 1.  Biological Samples and Measurement of Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress  Mother fasting blood and urine samples were collected once after 12 h overnight fast at mid-pregnancy (20–24 weeks of gestation). Offspring venous cord blood samples were collected at birth and spot urine samples were collected at 3 months of age. All samples were processed within 48 h and stored at −80°C until analysis. Hemolyzed samples were excluded.",12f0e938-1e12-4f16-baf3-ebe923b016eb
10,methods9,"  Determination of Plasma Carbonyl Groups  The plasma levels of carbonyl groups as a measurement of protein oxidation was determined by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH)) reagent according to the method of Reznick and Packer (31).  Determination of Plasma Hydroperoxides  Serum hydroperoxide levels were analyzed by the method described by Jiang et al. (32) using a ferrous oxidation/xylenol orange (ferrous oxidation/xylenol orange (FOX)) method.  Urinary Levels of Isoprostanes  The concentrations of 15-Isoprostanes F2 in urine were quantified using a urinary 8-isoprostane competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) kit (Oxford Biomedical Research Inc., Oxford, MI). Intra- and inter-assay CV was ≤ 10%. The values were normalized per milligram of creatinine. Creatinine was assayed using automated system (Cobas c 702, Roche Diagnostics, Mannhein, Germany). Inter-assay CV was ≤ 2.5%.",9567a1b8-0468-4ee6-8aff-1685a3e49b85
11,methods10," All isoprostane concentrations were adjusted to account for urinary dilution by dividing isoprostane concentrations (ng/ml) by creatinine levels (mg/dl) with results reported in ng/mg creatinine.  8OHdG  DNA oxidation in the serum of mothers and their offspring was estimated by the measurement of 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Japan Institute for the Control of Aging, Fukuroi, Shizuoka, Japan). Intra- and inter-assay CV were ≤ 8%.  Covariates  The following variables were considered as potential confounder factors because of their possible associations with the levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress and dietary patterns in pregnancy.",753ca1bc-e4cf-4661-8c9a-7596c25b26aa
12,methods11," We obtained information through questionnaires administered in person during pregnancy, such as maternal age, social class (using a widely used Spanish adaptation of the international ISCO88 coding system: I–II, managers/technicians; III, skilled; IV–V, semiskilled/unskilled; and unemployed) (33); educational level (incomplete secondary or less, complete secondary, and university); parity (0, nulliparous; vs. 1 or more, no nulliparous); maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) based on height and pre-pregnancy self-reported weight (kg/m2) (categorized as normal body mass index (BMI) <25, overweight 25 < body mass index (BMI) <30, and obesity body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30); maternal smoking during pregnancy (yes/no); self-reported physical activity during pregnancy (sedentary, poorly active,",a989f3d7-3465-4ff8-a784-04cb7b791b1e

Information related to child's sex, birthweight (g); gestational age (weeks); mode of delivery (vaginal non-instrumental, vaginal instrumental, and cesarean section); oxytocin use (yes/no); and Apgar score at 5th min was obtained from clinical records. The season of birth (spring, March–May; summer, June–August; fall, September–November; and winter, December–February) was also considered.  Statistical Analysis  We described the baseline characteristics of participants using means and standard deviation (SD) (normally distributed continuous variables), medians and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)) (non-normally distributed continuous variables), and numbers and proportions (categorical variables).",06419ec7-334d-4339-a2c9-26b1abca354a
14,methods13," Comparisons between groups were tested by Student's t-tests or Kruskal–Wallis tests, and Pearson's chi-squared tests.  Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate the beta coefficients for the association between maternal dietary indices in pregnancy (expressed both in tertiles and as continuous variables per 1-point increment) and the concentrations of biomarkers of oxidative stress measured in mothers and their offspring. The concentrations of biomarkers of oxidative stress showed non-normal distributions and were transformed using the natural log (ln) before analysis. The measures of associations are presented as log-transformed mean differences and regression coefficients, which can be interpreted as percentages after multiplying by 100 (34), or as geometric mean differences with their 95% confidence interval (CI).",81b33b42-7b34-445c-bd75-4e28a63a7e6e
15,methods14," Only covariates that were associated both with the exposure and the outcome of interest were used for adjustment, following the backward stepwise method (p < 0.1). The final covariates included in the models were maternal social class, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and the total intake of calories. For all the models, we calculated the value of p for trend using the exposure variable in tertiles as continuous.  Linear dose–response relation between continuous maternal dietary scores and the concentrations of biomarkers of oxidative stress was assessed using adjusted generalized additive models (GAMs) by the graphical examination and likelihood ratio test (35). GAMs indicated that the associations between dietary indexes and biomarkers did not deviate from linearity (p-gain > 0.10).  Data were analyzed in Stata Software (version 15.1, StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). ",3ebea5be-eb47-4f04-9670-f6f07f57cf68

The mean (± SD) age of included women was 32.7 (±4.5) years, 49% were primiparous and 55% had high educational level. Overall, 21% of women were overweight and 9% obese before pregnancy, median gestational weight gain was 12 kg, and 40% of women reported to be moderately or strongly active during pregnancy. Overall, 15.7% of women reported to smoke and 64% to use paracetamol during pregnancy. The prevalence of gestational diabetes and hypertension in pregnancy was 7.8 and 2.6%, respectively.

Maternal dietary indices in pregnancy were modestly to highly correlated with each other, having a Spearman's rho correlation coefficients between 0.23 and 0.76 (Supplementary Table 2).  Mothers with higher adherence to rMED, Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI), and Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI)-2010 were older, had higher educational level and social class, and tended to be non-smokers during pregnancy as compared with mothers with low adherence to these dietary patterns (Supplementary Tables 3–7).",bcecb325-84fd-4e78-ba37-f0c350f46227

Mothers with higher adherence to Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI) tended to be more physically active. Mother with gestational diabetes mellitus had higher adherence to rMED. Lower gestational weight gain was associated with the higher adherence to Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI)-2010 (Supplementary Table 7).

24,discussion0," To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the associations between maternal adherence to different food-based diet quality scores during pregnancy and the biomarkers of oxidative stress in mothers and their offspring. We found that higher maternal adherence to MD pattern, evaluated by the rMED index, decreased maternal oxidative DNA damage measured by 8OHdG levels and offspring lipid peroxidation measured by hydroperoxides levels. Moreover, greater maternal adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) pattern was associated with reduced maternal lipid oxidation during pregnancy measured by the urinary levels of 15-F2t-isoprostane. In addition, a higher maternal Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI) score was associated with lower lipid oxidation in the offspring measured by the urinary levels of 15-F2t-isoprostane.",d50ffb8b-53b2-4be4-9b18-beac3b8808e6
25,discussion1,"  Maternal rMED score, but not aMED score, was related to the reduced levels of maternal 8OHdG at mid-pregnancy, one of the most used markers for assessing DNA damage. Accordingly, other studies conducted in adults did not find an association between aMED index and urinary 8OHdG concentrations (36). Although both indices are the versions of original MD score, rMED index but not aMED considers the consumption of olive oil. To this regard, Luisi et al. (17) have reported the decreased levels of 8OHdG after MD rich in extra virgin olive oil, an essential component of this diet pattern that has a major beneficial role attributed to oleic acid and polyphenols. Both compounds exert antioxidant activity positively influencing several biomarkers of oxidative damage (37). Increased maternal levels of 8OHdG (DNA damage) have been related to the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), reduced birthweight, and preterm birth (38, 39).",a7cdd588-c4b5-4c3c-86fa-962f713bdb6c
26,discussion2," Moreover, the newborns of mothers with higher rMED scores showed the lower levels of hydroperoxides, a marker of lipid oxidation. In this regard, MD characterized by a high intake of vegetables and olive oil provide phenolic and polyphenols that have been found to reduce the generation of lipid hydroperoxides (40). Our results suggest that the reported beneficial effects of adherence to MD during gestation and early postnatal life on pregnancy and offspring growth outcomes (41–43) may be mediated through a reduction in DNA damage and lipid oxidation.  In addition, greater maternal Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was related to decreased levels of maternal urinary 15-F2t-isoprostane measured at mid-pregnancy. The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is a diet high in fruits, vegetables, total grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and non-full-fat dairy products and low in animal protein, sugar, and sodium.",36b61595-9e8f-478f-88f6-4fc3353ec4fb
27,discussion3," Our results are consistent with previous findings reported in adults suggesting that a long-term adherence to a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low in red meat may decrease lipid peroxidation measured as the plasma levels of F2-isoprostanes (44). These findings support the protective effects of a diet high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, and low in red and processed meats and refined grains lipid peroxidation in pregnant women. The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been shown to reduce blood pressure, a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, improve insulin sensitivity, and aid in weight loss in non-pregnant populations. Although some studies have failed to find an association between Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and hypertensive disorder and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (45, 46), others have reported positive associations. Asemi et al.",0d454723-cddc-43a6-bef9-201520989394
28,discussion4," showed that adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet beginning at 24–28 weeks gestation reduced systolic blood pressure and plasma glucose, and improved lipid profile during the 4-week study period (47, 48). Similarly, analysis of NHS II data revealed that adherence to several healthful dietary patterns, such as the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, prior to pregnancy corresponded with a lower risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (49). Some of the pathophysiologic changes occurring in these conditions developed during pregnancy are related to oxidative stress, and the components of the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may reduce maternal oxidative stress and enhance antioxidant capacity, which could result in reduced related pregnancy complications, such as hypertension disorders, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (4,5).",d715d806-fd0c-459f-afa1-cadd865212e9
29,discussion5,"  Regarding the Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI) scores, we found greater maternal Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI) score to be related with the reduced offspring urinary 15-F2t-isoprostane levels. Although not statistically significant, a similar trend was observed for maternal urinary 15-F2t-isoprostane levels measured at mid-pregnancy. Our results are consistent with previous studies in adolescents and adults showing that a long-term adherence to a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low in red meat may decrease lipid peroxidation (44, 50).  Our study had several strengths, such as its population-based, prospective design, the use of validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to evaluate diet and strict protocols, and the availability of extensive information on potential confounders. Some study weaknesses also deserve mention. In some instances, we might have had limited statistical power to detect associations within our cohort.",5fb4f6d3-ae74-43b4-ab93-e4504c187670
30,discussion6," Maternal dietary habits were evaluated using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), subjected to measurement errors that may led to an attenuation of effect estimates. Nevertheless, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) employed in this work was previously validated in pregnant women of the same area (19). We applied dietary indices which were not specifically created for the Spanish population, except the rMED index that was implemented for the Spanish cohort of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)). Our analysis was limited to a single measure of biomarkers of oxidative stress.  In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence that maternal adherence to healthy dietary patterns during pregnancy (i.e., rMED, Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Alternate Healthy Index (AHEI)) may reduce DNA damage and lipid oxidation in mothers and offspring.",c1dbb038-5748-497b-8376-a67f49f61e6d
