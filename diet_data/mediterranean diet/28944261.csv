0,introduction0,"Increasingly, refugee camps worldwide have become semipermanent or permanent, accompanied by an epidemiologic transition with fewer traumatic injuries, infectious diseases, or malnutrition as well as a much higher rate of chronic disease [1,2]. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease have become leading causes of morbidity and mortality among refugees in the Middle East [3–9], and are particularly prevalent among the >5 million registered Palestine refugees who live in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank, with a prevalence of 12.1% for type 2 diabetes and 18.6% for hypertension among adults over 40 years old [10]. Treatment for these chronic diseases now consumes a substantial part of the healthcare system budgets of the United Nations (UN) agency responsible for support of this population [1].",cca26c87-2cbd-4763-bed1-b812a37b895b
1,introduction1,"  Chronic diseases affecting long-term refugee settlements are commonly nutrition-related conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease; in addition, >40% of refugees (and, in some “fields” [refugee settlement areas designated by the UN], >80%) receive food aid. This aid is primarily composed of grain, flour, and rice, under a traditional model that emphasizes maintenance of calorie intake rather than dietary diversity [11]. The reason for this composition of aid is 2-fold: first, because aid was traditionally designed for emergency situations to address acute under-nutrition needs and second, because of supply-side pressures to dump excess United States agricultural production on international markets through food aid [12].",34816a5e-ef20-4fdf-bf8f-d391a6178f2c
2,introduction2," Reducing chronic disease among refugees through modification of food aid packages for primary prevention has become a subject of intensive discussion and preliminary policy changes, particularly because healthcare systems are so under-resourced in the region that funding for secondary prevention is severely constrained [13,14]. At least three reforms have been proposed and piloted to different degrees in field-based trials: (i) partial replacement of traditional food parcel delivery (“in-kind” food aid) with electronic debit cards (“e-vouchers”) restricted to purchasing non-tobacco/alcohol foods [14–16], (ii) partial replacement of traditional food parcel delivery with unrestricted cash [14,17], and/or (iii) an alternative food parcel that replaces a portion of grain with fruits and vegetables (canned, dried, or—if locally available—fresh) [18–20].",26fba7ca-38cc-4795-8681-39e6eca5bec1
3,introduction3,"  How much reduction in chronic disease, if any, would be expected from the proposed food aid policy changes remains unclear because field-based trials or pilot demonstration projects cannot be sustained for sufficient periods to track long-term outcomes. Increased dietary diversity, food security, sense of agency, and local economic growth have been observed from field-based randomized trials and pilot demonstration projects of alternative food aid. Diversion towards non-food products, theft, corruption, or food price inflation have been minimal or undetected in these studies, even under the cash delivery policy [14–16,21]. Hence, agencies such as the World Food Program have begun to expand debit card or cash programs, despite opposition from the US government and associated private contractors invested in traditional food parcel delivery [22–24].",daa2ee58-72f8-4973-bf60-ebfb38e1cca6
4,introduction4," The World Food Program, World Health Organization, and others working with large refugee populations in the Middle East have called for simulation models to help estimate the longer-term chronic disease consequences of alternative food aid [14,20].  The principal aim of this study was to identify the potential changes in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease among Palestinian refugees transitioning from traditional food aid to an alternative aid (debit card, cash, or alternative food parcel). Our primary a priori hypothesis was that transitioning from traditional food parcel delivery to a debit card for food would reduce the overall incidence and complications from type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, given prior evidence that the debit card intervention was particularly effective at increasing measures of dietary diversity [15,16].",46c9165e-d9d1-4d2f-a6fa-aad00bf6b648
5,introduction5," The secondary hypotheses were that the transition to debt card would be more effective than substitution to cash, but less effective than transition to an alternative food parcel. ",18b9667f-0a92-413c-b040-19f44ffe78be

S1 Text details the data underlying the results and provides the prospective analysis plan.  Model overview An individual-level microsimulation was created to estimate the impact of food aid delivery methods on food consumption, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease outcomes among the 20- to 79-year-old subpopulation receiving food aid (43%) among 5.3 million registered Palestinian refugees in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank.",2abb5356-6b27-477b-afac-81f6e0c5e307

Food procurement and consumption were separately tabulated for persons receiving traditional food parcel delivery of food aid (n = 1,507 households) and for persons obtaining electronic debit card delivery of food aid (n = 1,047 households), as detailed further below.  Health data were obtained from a random 10% sample of people in the electronic health record system of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA, the UN body responsible for care of registered refugees in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank, who are treated through 143 primary health facilities), stratified by age, sex, principal diagnosis, and location (2012–2015; n = 516,386; Table 1).",7b606518-da76-4994-b62c-c8d098ea4ed8

Outcome metrics Outcome metrics included key outcomes considered strongly attributable to changes in nutrition per a recent systematic review and meta-analysis [27]: incidence per 1,000 person-years of hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg or diastolic ≥80 mmHg or prescription of an antihypertensive medication), type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin A1c ≥6.",48cc2f93-3c94-4a4a-a103-45180b027d79

Exposures Two exposures were compared in the base case analysis: food parcel delivery of food aid and electronic debit card delivery of food aid. Food parcel delivery involved standardized monthly food parcels for each household that could be obtained by the designated recipient for each household at central locations in the community by participants. Each parcel contained wheat flour, white rice, sugar, vegetable oil, chickpeas, lentils, dried whole milk, and canned sardines.",47a3f7c8-cb33-492d-92fd-9e899a4296cb
15,methods10," Electronic delivery involved $30 per household member per month in value (in 2017 US dollars; roughly the same value as the food parcel) added via automated bank transfer to an electronic debit card, which could be used with an individual PIN code at participating store locations in the community. Delivery was accompanied by a text message reminder to the assigned card bearer’s phone for each household. Debit cards were electronically restricted to permit food purchases, excluding chocolates, alcohol, cigarettes, soda, or non-food items [28]. Both exposures were directed to refugees with household income below the location-specific definitions of absolute (approximately $3.7/person/day) or abject poverty (approximately $1.5/person/day) by a means test, along with those enrolled in parallel aid programs or meeting other definitions of socioeconomic marginalization (e.g., elderly, widowed, and living alone) [29,30].",d0bffda6-e5a7-450d-a49f-ad3f7fb4e52c
16,methods11,"  The change in food consumption attributable to a change from food parcel to electronic debit card delivery was estimated from a series of field-based studies by the World Food Program, comparing households after piloted roll-out of electronic debit card food aid to similar households remaining on food parcel delivery within each location (n = 2,554 households) [15,16]. Consumption in kilocalories (kcal) per person per day was obtained from quantitative household food frequency questionnaires among registered refugees, specifying daily per person consumption in each of 250 food categories (S1 Table). Major changes in consumption in each of the major Food and Agriculture Organization food groups (cereals; tubers, pulses, legumes, and nuts; fruits and vegetables; animal products; additional oils and fats (apart from animal products); and sugars [31]) are summarized in Table 1.",98f957e1-c411-4a4e-bc0b-49fbbc9b7b75
17,methods12,"  Impact simulations The estimated change in food consumption attributable to a change from food parcel to electronic debit card delivery was used to estimate changes in each outcome metric. Specifically, 4 intermediate variables were calculated to translate change in food consumption to change in each outcome metric: change in total calories, change in sodium and potassium intake, change in fatty acids (polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, and saturated fats), and change in overall dietary quality (Mediterranean Dietary Score [MDS] [32]). The MDS was chosen because it is predictive of incident type 2 diabetes independently from total calorie intake [33], and dietary interventions corresponding to MDS improvements have resulted in reduced type 2 diabetes incidence in prior trials among population in the Middle East [34,35]. Change in total calories was calculated by summing change in each food category from the field-based studies cited above.",9a3f6c9c-aef3-4a26-a849-6482eb59a0bb
18,methods13," Change in sodium, potassium, and fatty acids were estimated based on the per-unit content estimates of each food from standardized international databases [36,37], with bootstrapping across the distribution of content variations within each food category to construct 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (S2 Table). Change in MDS was estimated by calculating the score from the food patterns reported in quantitative food frequency questionnaires (S1 Text).  Change in total calories was used to estimate changes in body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), using the National Institutes of Health/Hall model of body weight change, which conditions body weight change estimates on age, sex, height, and starting weight, based on results of randomized controlled trials (S1 Text) [38–40]. Changes in sodium and potassium were used to estimate changes in systolic blood pressure using regression models from a large, international prospective epidemiological study (S1 Text) [41].",c1468e46-cc08-49be-a969-1896f706f517
19,methods14," Changes in fatty acids were used to estimate changes in total and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol using regression models from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (S1 Text) [42]. Changes in body mass index (BMI) and MDS were used to estimate change in hemoglobin A1c based on regression models from meta-analyses of prospective studies and risk projections (S1 Text) [43,44].  The health implications of the change from food parcel to electronic debit card delivery of food aid were estimated among a simulated refugee population of 5.3 million people.",b0618f77-bbfd-49f6-aa2e-e7878434786f
20,methods15," To produce the simulated population, Monte Carlo sampling with copulas was used [45], which is a strategy to repeatedly sample with replacement from the distribution of each variable in the demographic and health datasets: baseline age, sex, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c (percent), total and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (mmol/L), tobacco smoking status, serum creatinine, urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio, cardiovascular and metabolic medications, and diabetes and cardiovascular history as of 2015. When sampling, the approach of Monte Carlo sampling with copulas captures both the marginal distribution of each factor as well as the correlations among the factors (S1 Fig).  Following current modeling guidelines [46], the full life course of the population was simulated for any persons alive during a 10-year policy planning horizon (2016–2025).",e1dc81ce-6f4b-4549-96f4-62ceb112bc87
21,methods16," The outcome metrics among the population were simulated with traditional food aid delivery (baseline simulation), and then after transition to electronic debit card delivery of food aid (intervention simulation). In each simulation, UN birth rate estimates were used to simulate new births, the age- and sex-specific linear secular trend in each biomarker was used to simulated biomarker changes over time in each population, and both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality equations calibrated to the death statistics at each location were used to estimate deaths conditional on demographics and biomarkers [47]. Incidence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension were defined each year of the simulation based on blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c, respectively [48,49].",e038719d-58a3-4977-8436-f91628c6e794
22,methods17," The incidence of cardiovascular disease events—first nonfatal or fatal myocardial infarction, first nonfatal or fatal stroke—was estimated from the Globorisk equations for each location, which used age, sex, smoking status, diabetes status, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol to estimate risk [50,51]. The incidence of each of three microvascular complications—end-stage renal disease, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic retinopathy—and all-cause mortality were estimated by recalibrating the baseline hazard rate in the Risk Equations for Complications of Type 2 Diabetes (RECODe) to the observed rate of each complication from the most recent UNRWA health audits (Table 1) [52,53]. To account for uncertainty in the effect sizes of diet on health outcomes, we bootstrapped across the distribution of 95% CIs around each coefficient in the input equations to construct 95% CIs around each outcome metric.",2aeebb46-9fbb-4a92-9745-2ed44e58757b
23,methods18," We note these estimation approaches attempt to focus on previously validated physiological models of causality from specific nutritional components to the outcomes of interest, at the risk of underestimating indirect correlational effects for which causal pathways are not yet clearly established.  As an alternative to the debit card program, we simulated 2 other potential interventions. First, we simulated transitioning from debit card delivery of food aid to transitioning to cash aid, which has been introduced at several sites. The change in food consumption attributable to a change from food parcel to cash aid was estimated by food frequency questionnaires in a field-based study (n = 1,041 households receiving a debit card compared to 1,507 receiving cash aid) and included analysis of diversion of cash for non-food uses [14].",5baf49df-f38b-490b-b055-ec62dab8e38d
24,methods19,"  Second, we simulated a proposed alternative food parcel that would reduce the amount of grain within the food parcel but increase the amount of fruits and vegetables (canned, dried, and—where possible—fresh) included by way of both regional and local sourcing [20,24]. We specifically performed a threshold analysis to estimate how much decrease in grain and increase in fruits and vegetables would be needed to reduce the rate of the chronic disease outcomes in our model without increasing the total aid budget, given the exchange rate in budgetary dollars of bundled grain costs versus bundled fruit and vegetable costs. The latter costs incorporated the additional procurement, labor, transport, and storage costs of increased fruit and vegetable inclusion; correction for seasonal price variations; and (for noncanned/nondried fresh fruits and vegetables) additional refrigerated transport and storage and increased delivery frequency to avoid spoilage (Table 1) [54,55].",f0c89bc5-e055-4ab8-996c-8bd5959a39e9
25,methods20," We restricted the threshold analysis to ensure that the lower 95% CI bounds of total available food per person per day from the alternative food parcel would always remain above the World Health Organization/Food and Agricultural Organization goals to avoid food insecurity (>2,100 kcal/person/day, >10% from protein, >17% from fat [11]).  Sensitivity analyses Mis-reporting biases In a sensitivity analysis, we re-estimated differential outcomes in all 3 scenarios (transition to debit card, cash delivery, or alternative food parcel) when sampling from the empirical distributions of observed bias in how much food frequency questionnaires may under- or overestimate true consumption (S3 Table). We adjusted consumption estimates from the food frequency questionnaires to correct for under- or overconsumption based on comparisons of food frequency questionnaire responses to 12-day weighted food records over a 12-month period, which estimated typically 47.6 kcal/person/day (SE: 0.",90adeaef-f742-4414-b88a-82a1c5acc616

Compensatory behaviors In a second sensitivity analysis, specific to the alternative food parcel simulation, we estimated the degree of compensatory increase in nonaid food consumption—particularly of refined grains, oils and fats, and confectionaries—that would be necessary from out-of-pocket food purchases to fully neutralize any benefits of the alternative food parcel.  Enhanced aid budget In a third sensitivity analysis, also specific to the alternative food parcel simulation, we estimated the degree of increase in funding for the parcel that would be necessary to achieve a 1.",2c66ab48-72dc-4f20-b171-e99cdd0dea4c

Cost-effectiveness analysis Following recently updated cost-effectiveness guidelines [46], the incremental cost-effectiveness of transitioning away from traditional food parcel delivery of food aid to alternative strategies (debit card, cash, or alternative food parcel) was calculated from both a healthcare system and a societal perspective (S4 Table). Costs from each of the healthcare and societal perspectives are itemized in Table 2 and were computed from the same life-course perspective over a 10-year policy planning horizon, as with the impact simulation above.",cfda063c-d59b-46dd-9f65-614a52b72c27
28,methods23," Costs for both delivery mechanisms included formal and informal healthcare sector expenditures (reflecting observed trends in service provision, pharmaceutical dispensation, and utilization at UNRWA facilities), and nonhealthcare expenditures (including overhead expenditure and costs of in-kind food or debit card expenditures). Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost and utility-weighted years of life lived with disability) were calculated based on utility weights for each outcome metric from a prior international survey (Table 2) [58]. Both costs and DALYs were discounted at a 3% annual rate, and 2 incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (one for the healthcare sector perspective, the other for the societal perspective) were expressed in 2017 US dollars per DALY.  10.1371/journal.pmed.1002700.",677ed865-7907-4ad4-9f3d-59da98066769

The alternative food parcel would be expected to be both effective and cost-effective even if the total aid budget—including additional infrastructure costs for fruit and vegetable procurement and delivery—were unchanged.

Importantly, the primary analysis assumed that the nonaid portion of food consumption would not change with the change in aid, such that people would not compensate for the change by buying more grain and less fruits or vegetables with their own limited income; this assumption must be tested in field studies. An additional limitation is that we focused on a narrow subset of nutritional outcomes—type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk factors and outcomes—for which validated equations are available to translate food intake estimates into outcomes [50, 52–53].",ee6cfc01-9330-43fe-82e5-425bf03da6ec

Furthermore, our results are based on food frequency questionnaires, which are known to be less reliable and subject to underreporting compared to 24-hour dietary recalls. Finally, it is important to note that interventions that are effective in providing nutritional support in many locales may not be effective in the Gaza Strip, where blockades, conflict, and funding crises can limit quantities of goods distributed through the UN and humanitarian organizations. Additionally, prior detailed qualitative studies suggest that the supply chains for locally produced food versus internationally supplied food must undergo substantial review and modification to achieve the aim of an alternative food aid intervention [64–67].",3e82a0e4-8da3-42e3-9f50-8a8e6096d23e
