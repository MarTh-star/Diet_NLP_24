0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design  This was a cross-sectional observational study comprising a cohort of BC survivors within the SETA (SEnologia e Terapia Alimentare) study. The study started in 2012 at the Oncology-Hematology Department of Piacenza Hospital (Italy) and participants were recruited until 2014. The protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee (approval number: 840), and the study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Prior to the study starting, participants were informed about the aims and procedures of the study and provided their written informed consent. The volunteers were women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of BC, who had not received any pharmacological or radiotherapy treatment for at least two months.",85242366-e658-4732-b384-cf20665004da
1,methods1," The exclusion criteria of the study were: metastatic BC; pregnancy or breastfeeding; illness and pathological, social, psychological, or family conditions that did not allow adherence to the treatments or made compliance with the procedures of the research difficult; and the presence of any other malignant tumors. The eligible patients enrolled were assessed for Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) evaluation, anthropometric parameters, and blood samples were collected for biomarker analysis.  2.2. Dietary Assessment  The questionnaire formulated by Demetriou et al. [24] was administered to each patient in order to verify adherence to the MD. This score is based on the frequency of consumption of the food groups present in the MD pyramid. Items recommended for consumption are scored positively (0–5 points): (1) all cereals (bread, pasta, rice, etc.); (2) potatoes; (3) fruit; (4) vegetables; (5) legumes; (6) fish; (7) olive oil. Those that are recommended infrequently (i.e.",e0316668-d0b1-4081-9053-fcf6b2429dab
2,methods2,", never/once a month), are reverse scored based on consumption (5–0 points): (8) red meat products; (9) poultry; (10) full-fat dairy products (cheese, yogurt, milk). Alcohol (ml/day) is scored 5 points attributed to an intake of 0 mL up to 0 for a dose >700 mL. The maximum score is 55.  2.3. Anthropometric Parameters  Bodyweight (BW), height (H), and body mass index (BMI) were measured using a calibrated scale with a stadiometer (GIMA). The volunteers were asked not to exercise or consume any food or drink two hours before measurements were taken, and they were wearing only underwear. BMI (kg/m2) was calculated for every patient based on weight and height. Waist circumference was also measured, using a constant tension tape positioned under the midline of the participant’s armpit, at the midpoint between the lower part of the last rib and the top of the hip, at the end of a normal expiration with the arms relaxed at the sides.  2.4.",c6550f3d-9551-45cc-9875-eedc4b1d9cd7
3,methods3," Biomarker Analysis  Fasting blood samples were collected into heparinized tubes and the plasma was centrifuged and stored at −80 °C until analysis. A clinical autoanalyzer (ILAB-650, Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford, MA, USA) was used to determine the concentration of aspartate amino transferase–glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (AST-GOT), γ-glutamyl transferase (GOT) γ glutamyl transferase (GGT)), aspartate amino transferase-glutamic pyruvate transaminase (ALT/GPT), total protein, albumin, haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)), paraoxonase (paraoxonase (PON)) and thiol groups. Globulin was calculated as the difference between total protein and albumin.

4,methods4,"  The ROMs and thiol groups were determined with a kit purchased from Diacron International srl, adapted to ILAB 650. The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was determined following the method proposed by Jacometo et al. [25]. The haptoglobin level in the blood was determined by the methods proposed by Skinner et al. (1991) [26]; ceruloplasmin was determined with the method proposed by Sunderman and Nomoto (1970) [27]. Paraoxonase was determined by the method of Ferré et al. (2002) [28], adapted to the ILAB 650, as previously described by Bionaz et al. [29].  Glucose, insulin, and blood lipids (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides) were analyzed by the internal laboratory of the hospital. The homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was then derived [30].",ef962096-a7a2-4809-a279-88d43ae723ac
5,methods5," Concentrations of retinol, tocopherol, β-carotene, lycopene, β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (LC-4000, Jasco Europe SRL, Cremella, Italy). Plasma vitamins and pigments were extracted with n-hexane and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18, 4.6 × 150 mm, 3.5 µ column (Agilent Technologies Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA); a UV-VIS detector set at 325 nm (for retinol), 290 nm (for tocopherol), 450 nm (for β-carotene, lycopene, β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein); and 80:20 methanol:tetrahydrofuran as the mobile phase.  2.5. Statistical Analyses  Comparison of means between quartiles was performed using the Bonferroni multiple comparison test and the PROC GLM of the statistic software SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

After removing the women who had not provided enough samples or data, a total of 80 women with a mean age of 54.9 ± 10.6 were included in the final analysis. The mean BMI value for each quartile was approximately 30, the cut-off point between overweight and obesity.

7,methods7," Association of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with Lipid-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids  The circulating concentrations of lipid-soluble vitamins such as retinol, tocopherol, and carotenoids are reported in Table 1, and Pearson’s correlation of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with these molecules was explored (Table 2). The mean value of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was 33.5 ± 4.3. Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was significantly and positively correlated with lycopene (r 0.274, p < 0.05) and β-Carotene plasmatic concentration (r 0.331, p < 0.01), while, conversely, it was significantly but negatively associated with retinol (r 0.346, p < 0.05). If the data of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were disaggregated according to consumption of fruit and vegetables, a positive linear trend with β-carotene levels in blood was detected (p < 0.01, Table S1). Similarly, retinol blood concentrations were positively linked to the consumption of foods of animal origin (p < 0.",445aa1ac-b4a3-47f5-a810-54ee836d6044

As expected, β-Carotene, lycopene, β-cryptoxanthin, and tocopherol were positively correlated with Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (Table 2). Conversely, retinol was negatively associated with β-cryptoxanthin (r −0.231; p < 0.05) lycopene (r −0.248, p < 0.05), and tocopherol (r −0.405, p < 0.001). Finally, vitamin D resulted positively related to lutein-zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, β-carotene, and tocopherol.  3.3. Association of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with Biomarkers Related to Inflammation  The plasmatic levels of inflammatory biomarkers were also monitored in the cohort of BC survivors (Table 1). As presented in Table 3, a statistically significant inverse association between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was observed (r −0.256; p < 0.",915c6f0b-90cf-4be8-8594-ef07e1b7b294
9,methods9,"05), but none of the other inflammation-related biomarkers analyzed in this study were significantly associated with the score. A statistically significant direct association between ROM and Ceruloplasmin (r 0.736; p < 0.01) was found, as expected, as well as an indirect association between paraoxonase (PON) and haptoglobin (r −0.270; p < 0.05) (Table 3). In order to further explore the association between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)-related biomarkers and inflammation, a correlation of inflammatory biomarkers and lipid-soluble micronutrients was assessed (Table 4).  paraoxonase (PON) showed a positive relationship with retinol (r 0.454; p < 0.001) and a negative relationship with tocopherol (r −0.234, p < 0.05). ROMs were also negatively correlated with retinol (r −0.358, p < 0.01) and positively with some carotenoids such as lycopene (r 0.323, p < 0.01) and tocopherol (r 0.279, p < 0.05) (Table 4).

Pearson’s correlation of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), BMI, and cardiometabolic parameters is presented in Table 5. As expected, an inverse correlation was found between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and all the parameters considered, although none of them were significantly associated (p ˃ 0.05). Further investigation of the relationship between the parameters showed an expected positive correlation of BMI with fasting glucose (r 0.261, p < 0.05), of fasting glucose with fasting insulin (r 0.403, p < 0.001) and HOMA-IR (r 0.553, p < 0.001), and of TC with LDL-C (r 0.270, p < 0.05), HDL-C (r 0.318, p < 0.05) and TAG (r 0.806, p < 0.001).  4.",3b549268-9582-423c-acb9-1877ab6ea619
11,methods11," Discussion  This study confirms the hypothesis of an association of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with circulating dietary-related biomarkers in a cohort of BC survivors. In particular, we were able to describe that Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) correlated positively with blood levels of β-carotene, lycopene, antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)), while it was negatively associated with retinol.  Several studies have investigated the association between MD and the circulating concentration of several putatively cancer-protective molecules, which are mostly present in plant-based food groups, such as fruit and vegetables [36,37]. In fact, some biomarkers derived from the diet such as carotenoids, vitamin E, and other bioactive molecules may play an important role in preventing cancer [38].",bbb79134-aee8-4206-8f64-88082c475b7a
12,methods12," For this reason, identifying specific biomarkers characteristic of the MD could be a useful and evidence-based approach in order to accurately monitor adherence to this dietary pattern.  The mean values in blood levels of retinol, tocopherol, and vitamin D, found in the group of volunteers included in our study, fell in the normal range for each quartile of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). Moreover, blood glucose and TG resulted within the normal range, while total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were higher than the physiological levels. The women enrolled in this investigation presented haptoglobin levels falling into the normal range, while for ceruloplasmin the mean levels for each quartile were higher than the maximum threshold of physiological value.  This study showed that lycopene, β-carotene, and retinol were significantly correlated with the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) proposed by Demetriou [24] in this cohort of women treated for BC.",02e77b44-6be0-4de3-97ec-2d88ae58a5a3
13,methods13," As expected, lycopene and β-carotene were positively correlated with Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), while retinol was inversely associated with Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). A positive relationship between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and carotenoid blood levels was also reported in Fallaize et al.’s paper [39]. Since fruit and vegetables are the main dietary sources of carotenoids [40], the positive relationship of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with β-carotene can be easily explained. This result obtained is also useful for identifying a blood marker which allows us to validate adherence to Mediterranean Diet obtained through a food frequency questionnaire.  Moreover, these results can be partially accounted for by the fact that retinol is a vitamin present in meat and derived products, which can reduce adherence to the MD. However, an inverse association between plasma retinol and both carotenoids and tocopherol was found in this study.",e41e9de3-c3bb-45b1-8b9c-1f110a679409
14,methods14," The mean concentration of β-carotene found in this study (521,8 + 450 µg/L) was higher than the plasmatic concentration previously reported in a similar study, which described a concentration ranging from 171.11 ± 180.2 to 227.1 ± 157.8 µg/L, depending on the stage of the BC [41], and the mean values of 329.3 µg/L described for the women enrolled in the Italian cohorts of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition [40]. These results were consistent with adherence to the MD, which is based on a high intake of plant foods and low consumption of animal foods.  β-cryptoxanthin plasmatic concentration was lower than the mean values for women reported in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-based study of Al-Delaimy et al. (2004) [40] (0.29 vs. 0.",6ca6b0f6-eb24-4d2d-89ec-085360c5c159
15,methods15,"45 µM/L), but very similar to the concentration determined in another European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-based study [38], where vitamins and plant pigments were determined in BC affected women. All the results obtained in our study fell within the range of physiological variability observed in the available literature.  Regarding two parameters related to inflammation, haptoglobin, and ceruloplasmin, only for the latter were there observed mean values higher than the physiological threshold. This could be explained by the increased level of this molecule in women using the contraceptive pill [42]. Since in our cohort the menstrual cycle was blocked also in premenopausal women, higher levels of ceruloplasmin may be due to anti-estrogen treatment. Furthermore, the relationship between inflammatory parameters and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was explored.",3c82a791-4257-4bc9-8b84-e527c0bfed6b
16,methods16," Only antioxidant capacity was significantly and negatively correlated with Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), whereas none of the analyzed biomarkers were associated with it. However, we do not have an explanation for this result. In contrast with our result, a previous study described an amelioration of serum antioxidant capacity in BC survivors following the MD [18]. The inverse relationship between retinol and ROMs may be explained by the antioxidant properties of vitamin A, while the positive correlation of ROMs—inflammation and oxidative stress markers—with lycopene and tocopherol is unexpected and hardly justifiable. Haptoglobin, another molecule whose levels increase during inflammation, was not affected by the blood concentration of plant pigments in this investigation. Both these findings are in accordance with D’Odorico et al.",79b98135-e9b2-46da-95c1-05cff6c2692f
17,methods17," [43], who reported the absence of a relationship between retinol, tocopherol, and carotenoids with the C-reactive protein, a well-known inflammation marker. Nevertheless, both C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are related to the acute effects of inflammation and much less to the chronic consequences of this process. Conversely, ceruloplasmin seems to be a biomarker of the chronic consequences of inflammation as also demonstrated by the marked correlation with ROMs. paraoxonase (PON) blood level is the result of a complex interaction between nutrient intake (vitamins, antioxidants from plant foods, dietary fat) and genetic background [44]. Therefore, the relationship between paraoxonase (PON) and the vitamins of plant molecules is not easily predictable. Diets rich in plant food have caused both an increase [45] and a reduction in the concentration of paraoxonase (PON) [46].",8419ba2f-16c2-486a-b9dd-fdd1bfb281c3
18,methods18,"  The positive relationship of paraoxonase (PON) with retinol and tocopherols has been frequently observed [47] and is due to the anti-oxidative action of these vitamins, which, counteracting oxidative stress, reduce the need to synthesize paraoxonase (PON). In our study, only retinol confirmed this pattern, while vitamin E resulted inversely related to paraoxonase (PON) levels in the blood. This unexpected result could be due to the low level of inflammation in our volunteers (haptoglobin concentration was within normal range).  It is also important to note that we did not consider other bioactive molecules, such as polyphenols, which are well known to exert antioxidant activity in humans. Moreover, inflammation may also be dependent on other lifestyle factors. To date, a large body of evidence supports the role of antioxidant biomarkers such as vitamin A, vitamin E (α-tocopherol), and vitamin C in the prevention of BC and in BC survival, although there are still conflicting results.",1693b8ed-f3cc-4287-88bd-25a8cedb3c72
19,methods19," In previous studies, women with higher levels of vitamin C, α-carotene, β-carotene, or cryptoxanthin appeared to have a lower risk of BC than women with low levels of these antioxidants, while retinol was positively correlated with BC risk in relation to ER2/progesterone receptor–negative tumors [38]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis provided limited evidence regarding pre-diagnosis dietary intake of β-carotene and the overall survival of women with BC [48], while a recent systematic review supported the role of β-carotene in BC prevention [49]. A recent study suggested that pre-diagnosis concentrations of vitamin E were moderately—strongly associated with ER-BC risk after analysis with a metabolomic approach [50]. A 20-year Nurses’ Health Study carried out on women indicated that carotenoids were associated with a low risk of BC onset [51].",c50c8745-f52d-4a8a-9a13-a36702edb214
20,methods20,"  Concerning the correlation of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the lipid-soluble vitamins analysed with the cardiometabolic parameters analyzed, unexpectedly, we did not find a significant association. Different results were obtained by Skouroliakou and colleagues who found an amelioration of serum antioxidant and cardiometabolic parameters in BC survivors, which was associated with higher vitamin C, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin A and a-tocopherol levels than in the control non-MD treated group [18]. The association between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and cardiometabolic parameters and BMI, which are indicators of overall health status and possibly implicated in the recurrence of BC or in the onset of other comorbidities or secondary cancers, was investigated. As expected, all the parameters tended to be positively or negatively correlated with Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), although no statistical significance was found for any of them.",2cf52729-8e8e-4e04-8720-6109a43e9b0d
21,methods21," The improvement of cardiometabolic parameters is regarded as positive, especially for patients who are more likely to develop chronic diseases subsequent to the primary cancer.  Several reports have investigated the association between specific food groups and the risk of BC. A meta-analysis of prospective studies concluded that a high intake of fruit, and fruit and vegetables together, but not only vegetables, is associated with a slight reduction of BC risk [37], while no significant associations between fruit and vegetable intake and BC prognosis were found [52]. A very recent study on the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort demonstrated a positive association of alcohol consumption and suggested an inverse association of dietary fiber and possibly fruit intake with the risk of BC [53].",81224a5f-3f32-4455-8b6b-bdddeda37cb0
22,methods22," In our study, the correlation between specific food groups with serum molecules was investigated and a significant effect was found, but since these data are only related to the baseline status of the women enrolled, no conclusions can be drawn on the long-term effects on the recurrence of BC.  5. Conclusions  This study was focused on the evaluation of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with dietary-related biomarkers in a cohort of breast cancer survivors. The results indicated that Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was associated with some circulating lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamins, thus allowing us to evaluate adherence to the Mediterranean Diet in a more objective way than by administering food frequency questionnaires. Nevertheless, Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) did not correlate with inflammation-related biomarkers. This study will add knowledge to the literature on the identification of circulating blood molecules in BC survivors following the MD.",08c66821-6099-4d6f-bc6c-6b0663381566
23,methods23," Future studies will better explore the presence of other bioactive compounds and, possibly, a comprehensive metabolomic approach will allow us to better investigate the footprint of the MD and other dietary patterns in BC survivors. A future stage of the project will be focused on exploring the effect of the MD on BC relapse, mortality rate, anthropometric and metabolic-related blood parameters, and the overall quality of life of these patients in a medium-long term investigation.
