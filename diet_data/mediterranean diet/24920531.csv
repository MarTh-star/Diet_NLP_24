36,results26,"  Association of dietary patterns with coronary heart disease (CHD) and strokes in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region There were only three case–control studies that have examined the dietary intake among coronary heart disease (CHD) (18) and stroke patients in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region (19, 20), all of which were carried out in Iran. A summary of these studies is shown in Table 4. The studies examined the food consumption patterns among coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke patients and compared them with matched controls to determine whether the intake of various food items was associated with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and strokes. In coronary heart disease (CHD) patients, the daily intake of fish, vegetable oils, and tea had a protective effect on coronary heart disease (CHD), whereas the daily intake of full-fat yoghurt and hydrogenated fats was positively associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) (18).",e36d8c76-5612-4964-9f1e-d1ad2c325d38
37,results27," In stroke patients, the consumption of potatoes was associated with an increased risk of stroke (19), while no association was found between the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and the risk of stroke (20). In addition, when compared to the control group, stroke patients had a higher consumption of high-fat dairy, pulses, and fruits and a lower consumption of low-fat dairy and non-hydrogenated vegetable oils (19).  Association between dietary patterns and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region In order to clarify the association between diverse dietary patterns and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and strokes, it is crucial to examine the effect of the dietary intake on various risk factors such as blood glucose levels, blood lipids level, blood pressure, and body weight (21).",4a55ebc4-8fe0-47d4-84cf-75652bce06ca
38,results28," Twelve studies have examined the relationship of dietary patterns and/or individual food items with Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among adults in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries. The details of the methodologies and key findings of the included studies are summarised in Table 5.  Type 2 diabetes A cross-sectional survey among Iranian adults with Impaired Glucose Tolerance (Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT)) found that a Western dietary pattern (rich in sugar, butter, soda, sweets, eggs, hydrogenated fat, and mayonnaise) was significantly associated with increased levels of triacylglycerol (OR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.01–3.07) and blood pressure (OR=2.62, 95% CI: 1.32–5.23), while a vegetarian dietary pattern (rich in green leafy vegetables, fruits, potatoes, and legumes) was associated with increased plasma glucose levels (OR=2.26, 95% CI: 1.25–4.06) after adjustment for the confounding variables (22).",66526391-e42d-40f3-8221-400ac421e021
39,results29,"  Another case–control study conducted among type 2 diabetes patients in Lebanon using factor analysis identified four main dietary patterns: refined grains and desserts (rich in pastas, pizza, white bread, and desserts), a traditional Lebanese diet (rich in olives oil, fruits and vegetables, whole wheat bread, and traditional dishes), fast food (rich in French fries, fast-food sandwiches, mixed nuts, and whole fat diary), and meat and alcohol pattern (rich in eggs, alcohol, read meats, and sweetened beverages) (23). This study showed, after adjustment for confounding factors, that the refined grains and dessert dietary pattern (OR=3.85, 95% CI: 1.13–11.23) and fast-food dietary pattern were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (OR=2.80, 95% CI: 1.41–5.59), whereas, the traditional Lebanese dietary pattern was associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (OR=0.46, 95% CI: 0.22–0.97) (23).",ab211fa4-4712-4199-aa50-5f4212bf9512
40,results30," Similarly, a randomised crossover clinical trial conducted among patients with type 2 diabetes in Iran also reported the beneficial effects of the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet on several cardio metabolic risks (24). The study demonstrated that when compared to the control group, there were significant reductions in fasting blood glucose (fasting blood glucose (FBG)), low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), and blood pressure levels among the participants who followed the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet for 8 weeks, while there was a significant increase in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol level (24).  Obesity A number of studies have supported the fact that the traditional Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduction in overweight and obesity.",ab6752cf-fb94-4cee-a8fd-ee93402bae15
41,results31," For example, a cross-sectional survey in Lebanon showed that the Mediterranean diet (whole cereals, legumes, olive oil, fruit, fish, and vegetables) was negatively associated with a high waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) in both genders (25). Likewise, according to a study conducted by Naja et al. (23), the traditional Lebanese dietary pattern (rich in olives oil, fruits and vegetables, whole wheat bread) was also negatively associated with elevated body mass index (BMI) and WC among type 2 diabetes patients. The same study also reported that the refined grains and desserts dietary pattern, the fast-food dietary pattern, and the meat and alcohol dietary pattern were positively associated with high body mass index (BMI) and WC among type 2 diabetes patients (23).",a41dcdc6-4871-43d1-bf06-c10429d55864
42,results32,"  Metabolic syndrome A study analysing data from a nation-wide survey in Lebanon showed that the fast food and desserts dietary pattern (rich in fast-food sandwiches, pizzas, desserts, soft drinks) was associated with an increased risk of MetS (OR=3.13, 95% CI: 1.36–7.22) and hyperglycaemia (OR=3.81, 95% CI: 1.59–9.14), and the high-protein dietary pattern (rich in chicken, fish, low-fat dairy products, meats) was associated with an increased risk of high blood pressure (OR=2.98, 95% CI: 1.26–7.02) (16). There was no association between the traditional Lebanese dietary pattern (rich in olives, fruits, legumes, vegetable oil, grains), which is similar to traditional local Mediterranean food, and the risk of MetS (16).",33a3a521-3467-486c-bf22-544d68340051
43,results33," Another study from Iran reported that a dietary pattern rich in cereals, fruits and vegetables, legumes, fish, eggs, and dairy products was associated with a reduced risk of MetS, while a dietary pattern rich in pasta was positively associated with increased blood lipids (17).  A study conducted among Iranian adults showed that the intake of whole grains was associated with reduced hypertriglyceridemia waist (HW) (serum triacylglycerol concentration and WC) and WC (26). Moreover, another survey in Iran, which examined the relationship between MetS and the intake of dairy products, indicated that the consumption of dairy products was associated with decreased blood pressure and WC (27). Similarly, an RCT conducted in Iran demonstrated a beneficial effect of the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet in reducing the metabolic risk among patients with MetS (28).",791d58d0-c8c4-41e4-bafa-a6527dbb4b01
44,results34," For example, when compared with the control group, significant reductions in body weight, triglycerides, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were observed in both males and females in the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet group (28).  Abnormal blood lipids One study in Saudi Arabia showed that subjects who consumed more than six cups of black tea per day (>480 ml) were significantly less likely to have dyslipidaemia including, high TC (OR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.41–0.97), high triglycerides (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.35–0.86), and high very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) (OR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.39–0.93) (29). However, this study did not find any association between black tea consumption and high LDL and, HDL (29).  Multiple Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors In Iran, a study found that a healthy dietary pattern (rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, fruit juices, poultry, whole grains) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of dyslipidaemia (OR=0.",23508243-c04e-430c-92d6-a1416cde58b1

Conversely, the Western dietary pattern (rich in red meat, high-fat dairy products, refined grains, hydrogenated fats, sweets, soft drinks, eggs, pizza) was significantly associated with an increased risk of dyslipidaemia (OR=2.59, 95% CI: 1.41–4.76), hypertension (OR=2.61, 95% CI: 1.27–5.19) (30). The Iranian dietary pattern (rich in potato, tea, refined grains, whole grains, legumes, hydrogenated fats) was only significantly associated with an increased risk of dyslipidaemia (OR=1.73, 95% CI: 1.02–2.99) (30). In Saudi Arabia, a food consumption survey showed a significant association between the high intake of energy derived from fatty foods and high body mass index (BMI) and hypertension levels in both genders (31).",aedec1db-8264-4de5-991d-18dcebd3e015

47,discussion0,"This review has revealed that specific dietary patterns and/or the individual food components of a diet are associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), strokes, and associated risk factors among adults in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries. When looking at the individual food components of a diet, studies have shown that the intake of fish, vegetable oils and black tea had a protective effect on coronary heart disease (CHD), while the intake of full-fat yoghurt and hydrogenated fats were positively associated with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) (18–20). These findings were similar to those reported among the US population (32, 33), except for the effect of black tea on coronary heart disease (CHD) (34).",4839b80c-2761-45c6-b228-cfd5000976a0
48,discussion1," In addition, this review found a significant positive association between potato consumption and the risk of strokes (19), and this has been explained by the high glycaemic index and the high amount of carbohydrates which make potato a type of food that increases the risk of strokes. Similar results have been reported in Australia leading to conclusions that foods with the high amount of glycaemic index, such as potatoes, may increase the risk of stroke death (35).  The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has witnessed vast changes in dietary patterns resulting from the marked shifts in socio-economic status and demographics, as well as rapid urbanisation and modernisation during the last few decades. This review also identified that the Western dietary pattern rich in sweets, fatty foods, meat, whole dairy products, fast food, salty nuts, and canned foods has become predominant among the majority of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) population (16, 22, 23, 30).",5cf7c3a7-faf0-4658-8fc8-94a9bb118104
49,discussion2," These results are consistent with available food consumption surveys among adults in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, such as in Lebanon, Egypt and Iran, which have indicated that eating patterns are mainly characterised by a high intake of sugar, meat, soft drinks and refined grain, as well as low consumption of fish, fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains (36–38). Further, using a factor analysis of dietary intake data from a national survey in Iran, it has also been reported that the majority of the study subjects were consuming the Western dietary pattern (high in sweets, fast foods, salty nuts, canned foods) (39). These findings were also consistent with the FAO food balance sheets data, which indicated that the availability of sugar and sweeteners (kg/person/year) has gradually increased gradually in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region during the last four decades especially in oil-rich countries such as Saudi Arabia and Algeria (40).",c6dc35c4-3887-4e32-9599-c53c333f831e
50,discussion3,"  The findings of this review also indicate that adopting the Western dietary pattern is significantly associated with almost all Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including an increased risk of obesity, blood lipids, hypertension, diabetes and MetS in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) populations (16, 22, 23, 30). Similar results have been reported among US and Mexican populations (41, 42). On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet, also known as the healthy diet, is the traditional diet in North African countries and three Middle Eastern countries, Syria, Israel and Lebanon, and it has been inversely associated with obesity, diabetes, and MetS among the same populations (16, 23, 25). Therefore, there is increasing evidence illustrating the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet in the reduction of morbidity and mortality from Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (43, 44).",21d4cc38-8738-4ee6-973b-8fbde3854d75
51,discussion4," The Mediterranean dietary pattern mainly consists of a high consumption of fruits, vegetables, wholegrain cereals, legumes, nuts, olive oil, fish and seafood. It is also characterised by a moderate consumption of dairy products, eggs, poultry and wine (45). These individual food elements offer many benefits for cardiovascular health and prevention of Cardiovascular disease (CVD), as they are good sources of monounsaturated fatty acids, antioxidants, magnesium, fibre, and polyphenols (45).  Limitation of the review The major limitation in this review was the lack of studies from several countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region that have examined eating patterns among coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke patients; only three case–control studies were identified and all of them were from Iran. In addition, the majority of the included studies in the review utilised cross-sectional design, and thus failed to assess causal relationships.",fbc6f3ed-73c7-4d83-be53-d892858128f0
52,discussion5," Further, most of the studies reported dietary patterns using food frequency questionnaires which might have increased the risk of recall bias and overestimated the consumption of healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables. Also, some of the studies that reported (16, 23) significant associations between diet and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) had a very wide confidence intervene for odd ratios (ORs) which may indicate that the results of these studies are not reliable either due to small sample sizes or the sampling procedures are not representative.",55341978-4aa3-4cf5-a3d5-0990e300f0f7
53,discussion6,"  Conclusion This review demonstrates that Western dietary patterns, which are mainly characterised by high consumption of sugar, fatty foods, meat, and refined grains, and low consumption of fruits, vegetables, fibre, and whole grains, are very common in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and adherence to this Western diet is linked with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), strokes, and associated risk factors among adult populations of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries. On the contrary, adherence to the Mediterranean diet or dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and/or individual food components of these diets appears to be associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and associated factors. Therefore, increasing awareness of the high prevalence of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and associated risk factors among the public is crucial.",a4e63ff7-841f-4271-8827-94b55e89aa66
54,discussion7," In addition, there is an urgent need for nutrition education programs among all segments of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) population to increase awareness regarding healthy diets and diet-related chronic diseases. This should be combined with encouragement of healthy lifestyle patterns, including increasing physical activity and a reduction in smoking, to enhance the prevention of heart disease and associated risk factors. Furthermore, there is a crucial need for further intervention studies focusing on a range of diverse cohorts in relation to coronary heart disease (CHD) and strokes, in order to help in providing nutritional recommendations to control Cardiovascular disease (CVD) among the population of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
