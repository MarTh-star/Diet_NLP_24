0,introduction0,"Despite advancements in screening and diagnosis, colorectal cancer (Colorectal cancer (CRC)) remains the third most common cancer in the USA and the second and third leading cause of cancer mortality in men and women, respectively (1). Interestingly, only ~5–6% of Colorectal cancer (CRC) cases are linked to germline mutations (2), whereas ~70% of Colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors are sporadic (3). These statistics suggest great opportunities may exist for the prevention of Colorectal cancer (CRC). The initiation and progression through the adenoma–carcinoma sequence is multifactorial and influenced by a variety of environmental factors (4). Depending on the eating pattern, diet may ameliorate or even increase Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (5).  For an in-depth analysis of genetic aberrations associated with the development of Colorectal cancer (CRC), we direct the reader to excellent reviews by Mundade et al. (6), Amaro et al. (7), and Mármol et al. (3).",3ad126f3-0d09-4dc8-86d5-46043df942fc
1,introduction1," Briefly, three major molecular pathways of sporadic Colorectal cancer (CRC) have been identified, and include (1) chromosomal instability (chromosomal instability (CIN)), characterized by abnormal karyotypes, aneuploidy, and loss of heterozygosity; (2) microsatellite instability (microsatellite instability (MSI)), characterized by silencing of DNA repair mechanisms, namely mismatch repair pathways; and (3) CpG island methylator phenotype (CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)), associated with hypermethylation and silencing of tumor suppressor genes (3, 6). Recent estimates indicate that ~24% of Colorectal cancer (CRC) carry the microsatellite instability (MSI) or CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) phenotype; and ~27% have microsatellite instability (MSI) and chromosomal instability (CIN) (8). The chromosomal instability (CIN) pathway, also known as the adenoma–carcinoma sequence (Figure 1), appears to be predominantly involved in ~80–85% of sporadic Colorectal cancer (CRC) (9).",d67259a7-53ae-46e9-8dde-55ee3af21d16
2,introduction2," Mechanisms contributing to the chromosomal instability (CIN) phenotype include telomere dysfunction and alterations in chromosome segregation, and DNA damage, leading to altered expression of genes including APC, KRAS, PI3K, and TP53 (3). Loss of APC leads to increased nuclear transcriptional activity of β-catenin and prolonged activation of the Wnt pathway (10). Normally, β-catenin is sequestered and degraded in the cytosol by a complex comprising APC and other accessory proteins. However, the sustained activity of β-catenin results in the development of a stem cell phenotype. Cells do not migrate to the epithelial surface to be sloughed off in the intestinal lumen, leading to the accumulation of undifferentiated cells in colonic crypts and polyp formation.",3e254487-076a-4180-b613-8afae66fe36a
3,introduction3," Progression through the adenoma to carcinoma sequence is further driven by KRAS and PI3K mutations, and constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein (mitogen activated protein (MAP)) kinase (mitogen activated protein (mitogen activated protein (MAP)) kinase (mitogen activated protein (MAP)K)) pathway, accompanied by uncontrolled cell cycle entry due to mutations in TP53 (3).

Progression through the various stages of the adenoma–carcinoma sequence takes ~15–20 years, whereas the transition from carcinomas to metastatic tumors involves markedly less time (~2–3 years) (11).",6839cf3b-d83d-4fce-b35d-41cffcfd2210
4,introduction4," The relatively extended period of time required for progression through the benign stages of the adenoma–carcinoma sequence suggests environmental factors, such as the diet, significantly influence Colorectal cancer (CRC) development. The health benefits of the Mediterranean diet (MD) have been extensively documented in the literature and include protection against cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and various cancers. This is also reflected in its inclusion as a recommended dietary pattern, among others (i.e., Healthy US Style Eating Pattern and Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern) in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (12). This raises the question whether adherence to a MD offers protection against the development of Colorectal cancer (CRC). To this end, we have reviewed preclinical and clinical studies investigating the effect of the MD or its components on Colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis.",9781f83e-edaa-48c5-8891-b8d85d644189
5,introduction5," We precede the review of research evidence with a short description of the MD eating pattern; various indexes and scores used to estimate adherence to the MD pattern; and how foods and bioactive components in the MD may protect from chronic intestinal inflammation, such as that seen in inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)), a condition that predisposes to Colorectal cancer (CRC). We follow-up our review with a brief discussion of the role of the MD in epigenetic processes and changes in intestinal microbiota related to Colorectal cancer (CRC).  MD Eating Pattern The MD eating pattern refers to dietary behaviors established through the blending of food, religious, economic and cultural practices by civilizations that have occupied the Mediterranean basin for millennia (13). Twenty-two countries located across three continents are considered to have contributed to the MD eating pattern. As a result, there is no one absolute definition for the MD.",ed5768cd-0051-4162-8523-740aafe64d1a
6,introduction6," Instead, this pattern can be described as one that (1) is abundant in plant-based foods such as whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables; (2) comprises olive oil as the main source of dietary fat; (3) limits intakes of red and processed meat, saturated fat, and refined sugars; (4) favors low-to-moderate intake of low-fat dairy and moderate consumption of fish; and (5) emphasizes regular, but moderate, alcohol (mostly red wine) consumption with meals (14). The MD eating pattern also recommends the inclusion of water, tea, and herbal infusions as non-alcoholic beverages (13, 15, 16).  Several components of the MD such as olive oil, fish, red wine, tea, fruits and vegetables, and other fiber sources contribute a myriad of bioactive compounds including antioxidants (i.e.",ee631f59-4b36-45ff-bca4-6a680bdaab76
7,introduction7,", proanthocyanidins, flavonoids, and other polyphenolic compounds); n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)), docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)); and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; i.e., butyrate). Given the diversity of available foods and dietary practices among Mediterranean countries, various definitions of the MD have been proposed such as one that favors higher intake of monounsaturated (monounsaturated (MUFA)) over saturated (saturated (SFA)) fatty acid (monounsaturated (MUFA)/saturated (SFA) ~1.6–2.0); dietary fiber (41–62 g/day); antioxidants (~3,500–5,300 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid equivalent/day); and phytosterols (~370–555 mg/day) (17). The MD has been extensively studied over several decades and suggested to provide protection against various chronic diseases and various cancers, including Colorectal cancer (CRC) (18, 19).",5bf6b38e-c391-455e-8def-7e4e6c6dae27
8,introduction8,"  MD Scores and Indexes A recent review identified a total of 22 Mediterranean index and score systems differing in the number of components, scoring range, and type of food components (20). A detailed discussion of these indexes is beyond the scope of this work. Therefore, we refer the reader to the description of the Mediterranean pyramid as reported by the Mediterranean Foundation Group (21). However, we provide a short description of some MD score systems (Table 1; Data Sheet S1 in Supplementary Material) and their potential usefulness to predict adherence to a MD eating pattern.

12,introduction12,"  fLipid ratio defined as polyunsaturated fatty acid plus monounsaturated fatty acid intake divided by saturated fatty acid intake (PUFA + monounsaturated (MUFA))/saturated (SFA).  The MD Score (MD Score (MDS)) considers the consumption of nine different foods including non-refined cereals, dairy, fish, fruits and nuts, legumes, meat and meat products, monounsaturated (MUFA)/saturated (SFA), vegetables (including potatoes), and alcohol (22). The total MD Score (MDS) ranges from “0” to “9” with higher scores indicating closer adherence to the MD eating pattern. The alternate Mediterranean diet (aMED) scoring system (0–9) was developed by Fung et al. (23) as an adaptation to the MD Score (MDS). The aMED system considers the intake of fish, fruit, legumes, monounsaturated (MUFA)/saturated (SFA), nuts, red and processed meats, vegetables (excluding potatoes), and whole grains. The Italian MD index (Italian MD index (IMDI)) was developed by Agnoli et al.",bb3837d8-f179-4847-aac5-b0be74eb0314
13,introduction13," (24) as an adaptation of the Greek MD index. This system provides a score based on intake levels across 11 items including butter, fish, fruit, legumes, Mediterranean vegetables, olive oil, pasta, potatoes, red meat, soft drinks, and alcohol (24). Finally, the modified MD score (MMD Score (MDS)) was designed (25) to assess the intake across nine food components including those considered beneficial (vegetables, legumes, fruits, cereals, fish) and detrimental (meat and dairy products), and ethanol intake. In general, these systems are in good accord when considering fruits and vegetables as healthy, and meats as negative, dietary choices. However, some systems differ with regard to criteria for estimating moderate alcohol consumption as well as cut off values of intake (i.e., medians, tertiles, or established servings) (26). In general, MD indexes have shown satisfactory performance in assessing adherence to this dietary pattern.",20d01aba-e3c5-4f82-9b74-1a6428471243
14,introduction14," However, further studies are needed to better account for MD pattern variations (20).  MD Eating Pattern and Inflammation-Related Colorectal cancer (CRC) Chronic intestinal inflammation, such as that seen in Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is a predisposing condition to Colorectal cancer (CRC) (27). This is demonstrated by the increased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients (28, 29). Colorectal carcinogenesis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is believed to be similar to the adenoma–carcinoma sequence of sporadic Colorectal cancer (CRC) (30). Several of the genetic alterations observed in sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis are observed in colitis-associated Colorectal cancer (CRC) (31, 32). However, differences in the timing and frequency of genetic alterations have been observed.",22a3db3d-4355-40f6-9006-7c57525e843b
15,introduction15," For example, loss of APC occurs with less frequency and at a later stage in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related Colorectal cancer (CRC) and loss of p53 occurs earlier and in nondysplastic tissue of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (30). In addition, the upregulation of proinflammatory factors such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) is observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related Colorectal cancer (CRC). The capacity for the MD to prevent against Colorectal cancer (CRC) is likely due in part to the sum of anti-inflammatory effects exerted by the various food components that contribute to this dietary pattern, particularly those foods and beverages contributing a significant load of phenolic compounds (i.e., olive and fish oil, and plant-based foods).",7aba3fcb-731b-479d-a402-085a9b96881b
16,introduction16," Although an extensive review of the effects of bioactive compounds commonly present in the MD on the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is beyond the scope of this work, we briefly highlight some of the overall findings pointing to protection by major components of the MD from biological end points of colonic and systemic inflammation. The information presented in this section has been summarized in Table 2.  Table 2 Summary of studies investigating anti-inflammatory effects of MD components.

Preclinical Studies on Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Bioactive MD Components n-3 Fats Studies in Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells demonstrated that a fish oil mixture (1:1 ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) decreased expression of the COX-2 gene (PTSG2) (33). In experiments using the dextran sodium sulfate (dextran sodium sulfate (DSS))-induced UC rat model, a diet with a 2:1 ratio of n-6 linoleic acid (LA) to n-3 α-linolenic acid (acid (LA) to n 3 α linolenic acid (ALA)) improved clinical activity and decreased colonic levels of several proinflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-1β (34).",d8c9120c-1be8-4025-8f9d-f39d255470d7
23,introduction23," Similarly, in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-mice a diet rich in n-3 fatty acids (2:1 LA/acid (LA) to n 3 α linolenic acid (ALA)) decreased colonic TNFα and IL-17 (35). Experiments utilizing the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS))-induced UC rat model demonstrated an n-3-enriched diet (30% of total fat) improved histological index scores (histological index scores (HIS)) and decreased alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase activity, in addition to decreasing colonic levels of proinflammatory factors (36). In IL-10 deficient [IL-10(−/−)] mice, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (i.e., 35.5 mg/kg/day) decreased colonic infiltration of inflammatory cells, improved histological index scores (HIS) scores, and decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-17, TNFα) (37). These effects were observed in parallel with enhanced barrier function. Another study in IL-10(−/−) mice reported eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (3.",d82a7a19-ddeb-4f31-a8e1-b94bbcf45818
24,introduction24,"7% by weight) to be protective against bacterial-induced inflammation and this effect was attributed to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) signaling (38).  Fiber Studies in the HLA-B27 transgenic rat model of CD showed a high fiber diet (5% psyllium seed by weight) decreased colonic levels of nitric oxide, LTB4, and TNFα (39). Another study in HLA-B27 rats on a high fiber diet (5 g/kg body weight/day) demonstrated decreased IL-1β expression in cecal tissue and improved histological index scores (HIS)s (40). In female trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-rats, dietary supplementation with lactulose through drinking water (2.5% wt/vol) reduced TNFα and LTB4 levels in colon tissue (41). Decreased levels of cecal TNFα and leukotrienes were also observed in male dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-rats given oral lactulose (300–1,000 mg/kg BW) twice daily (42).",33312a39-bab8-4a5e-8faf-235db0a81381
25,introduction25,"  Butyrate, a SCFA byproduct of bacterial fermentation in the gut, is proposed to contribute to the oncoprotective effects of fiber, given that it decreased cell proliferation (40–100 mM) and cell migration (10–50 mM), and induced apoptosis (10–50 mM) in human RKO colon cancer cells (43). A butyrate-enriched diet (0.5% by weight) decreased TGF-β, but increased IL-10, memory T lymphocytes and dendritic cells in intestinal mucosa of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-mice (44). In another study, administration of oral butyrate (100 mg/kg) was also reported to improve histological index scores (HIS) in both IL-10(−/−) mice and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-mice (45). The authors of this study attributed these benefits of butyrate to inhibition of NF-κB signaling and histone deacetylation.  Olive Oil and Phenolic Compounds Two major components of olive oil are 18:1 oleic acid (~70%) and phenolic compounds [i.e.",f0663eee-ee61-44e6-a038-06410a6520e1
26,introduction26,", tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate (epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)), oleuropein, quercetin, and rutin] (46, 47). In vitro studies attributed the anti-inflammatory effect of olive oil to the phenolic fraction, rather than oleic acid. In colon cancer cells, whole olive oil, but not oleic acid, downregulated expression of COX-2 (33). This suggests that phenolic compounds, rather than oleic acid content alone, should be considered when evaluating the health benefits of different olive oil preparations. Extra virgin olive oil (Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) (5% enriched diet) administered to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-rats improved disease activity indexes (DAIs) and histological index scores (HIS), and decreased expression of several inflammatory factors in colonic tissue (48).",9dbc50f4-a06c-4b47-ab34-43680b2a23d8
27,introduction27," In dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-mice, an Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-enriched diet (10%) showed similar protective effects in regard to DAI, histological index scores (HIS) and colonic levels of proinflammatory markers (49). Additional anti-inflammatory effects were observed upon dietary supplementation with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) plus hydroxytyrosol confirming the important role of phenolic compounds in olive oil (49). Other studies in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) mice identified the unsaponifiable fraction of olive oil was efficacious in improving DAI and histological index scores (HIS) in addition to decreasing colonic expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and various proinflammatory factors (i.e., TNFα; COX-2, iNOS) (50). An anti-inflammatory effect of olive oil has also been demonstrated in genetic models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",365cbe52-3e4f-4271-a8b8-a0185a60a2dc
28,introduction28," For example, in IL-10(−/−) mice, olive oil-supplemented chow (7%) decreased colonic COX-2 levels and reduced the risk of chronic colitis-related neoplasia (51).  Polyphenols found in grapes and red wine may also reduce gut inflammation. In the peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-PS) rat model of CD, resveratrol (100 mg/kg, administered post-PG-PS injection) decreased cecal expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and TGFβ (52). In dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-mice, daily supplementation with resveratrol (3 mg/kg BW) decreased COX-2, iNOS, TNFα, and IL-1β and increased expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 (53). Studies using the IL-10(−/−) mouse model demonstrated administration of resveratrol by oral gavage (100 µl of 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg) improved clinical scores and decreased colonic levels of several inflammatory markers including TNFα, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-1β (54).",a0b236cf-448b-4c07-b20a-98f42ecc3df8
29,introduction29," The anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol in the colon have also been reported in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-rats (55). Overall, these preclinical studies support the idea that consumption of bioactives commonly present in the MD may be useful for the prevention of biological end points associated with colonic inflammation.  Clinical Studies on the Influence of Diet in Systemic Inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Whole Diet An observational study deriving data from the 1936 Lothian birth cohort documented that adopting a MD reduced serum levels of fibrinogen, a biomarker of systemic inflammation (56). Another study in a cohort from the Athenian province of Attica reported reduced C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)), fibrinogen, IL-6, TNFα, and homocysteine levels were associated with high compliance to MD Score (MDS) over a 10-year period (57).",dab2e0d3-15b5-4c39-892e-bffb32679ae5
30,introduction30," A meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials evaluated the impact of the MD on development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (58). Overall, results of this meta-analysis suggested that adoption of a MD eating pattern decreased biomarkers associated with systemic inflammation (high sensitivity-C reactive protein (CRP)) and endothelial dysfunction [intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)] (58).  A crossover trial compared the effects of a monounsaturated (MUFA)-rich MD to those of a saturated (SFA)-rich or low-fat-high-carbohydrate (low fat high carbohydrate (LFHC)) diet on the postprandial inflammatory state of elderly men and women from Córdoba Spain (mean age 67.1 years) (59). At the end of a 3-week intervention period, subjects on the MD had decreased fasting and postprandial expression of p65, a subunit of NF-κB, in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), compared to subjects on the saturated (SFA)-rich diet.",2c2b5434-4053-4359-806c-f391b56e5425
31,introduction31," Also, subjects on the MD diet had decreased postprandial expression of p65 and TNFα compared to subjects on the low fat high carbohydrate (LFHC) diet (59). Another study in Italian men and women with metabolic syndrome (MetS) (mean age 43 years) examined the effects of adherence to a MD on markers of systemic inflammation (60). At the end of the 2-year intervention period, subjects following the MD eating pattern had higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) and lower serum levels of IL-6, IL-7, IL-18, and hs-C reactive protein (CRP) compared to controls (60).  In CD patients, the anti-inflammatory action of a MD that included salmon, organic avocados, kumara (a variety of sweet potato), gluten-free bread, Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), green tea, honey, and fish oil has been investigated using a transcriptomic approach (61). Findings suggested that adoption of the MD eating pattern resulted in upregulation of ~1,900, and downregulation of ~1,650 genes.",4a8832cd-16bb-429b-963d-4a40df65b04f
32,introduction32," After 6 weeks of adherence to the MD, there was a trend for reduced serum levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and DNA damage in PBMC (61). Further characterization of these gene expression and biochemical changes is crucial to develop molecular markers that predict the health benefits of the MD eating pattern against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  n-3 Fats An intervention trial in overweight males [body max index (BMI) > 25, 25–65 years of age] found daily supplementation with ~58 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 32.5 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for 4 weeks decreased circulating levels of proinflammatory IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα, while increasing circulating levels of adiponectin (62). Similar results were observed in another study providing 0.8 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus 1.6 g docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/day in a Mexican population with multiple sclerosis (18–55 years) currently undergoing interferon therapy (63).",bc8e2de7-0cf5-4b46-98d4-6292d9ce8bbb
33,introduction33," After 1 year of intervention, subjects that supplemented their diet with fish oils had markedly reduced levels of serum TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and NO metabolites compared to control subjects (63). These results suggested that the anti-inflammatory benefits of n-3 fatty acids commonly present in the MD eating pattern could be extended to non-Mediterranean groups. This idea has been tested in a prospective study in the United Kingdom and showed a decreased risk of UC in association with increased intake of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and borderline significant lower risk with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and total n-3 intake (64). Other studies noted that in UC patients taking prednisone, supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (3.24 g/day) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (2.16 g/day) for 4 months lowered rectal LTB4 levels; improved acute and total histological index scores (HIS); and decreased the average needed dose of prednisone (65).",7d413f0b-60d7-4d9d-9dcc-f2d490ad094b
34,introduction34," Parallel studies also showed that supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (3.2 g/day) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (2.4 g/day) for 6 months reduced natural killer cell cytotoxicity and serum IL-2 in UC patients (66). Overall, these clinical studies support the conclusion that n-3 fatty acids present in fish oil, namely eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), protect against development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  Fiber A cross-sectional study of healthy subjects from the Italian cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) (67) reported an inverse relationship between intake of fiber and circulating levels of various markers of systemic inflammation (i.e., IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, and TNFα) (67).",1d6ee1c0-6419-4a93-9648-07b61342039b
35,introduction35," A clinical trial with UC patients showed a reduction in endoscopic index parameters (erythema, edema, friability, granularity, erosion) and clinical activity (e.g., diarrhea, nocturnal diarrhea, blood in stools, incontinence, abdominal pain, or cramping) as a result of supplementation with fiber (20–30 g/day of germinated barley) (68).  Olive Oil Epidemiological data suggest that olive oil, in particular Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), is effective for the prevention of systemic inflammatory responses (69). In Spanish coronary heart disease patients, doses of 50 ml/day of unprocessed Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) over two 3-week periods reduced serum levels of IL-6 and C reactive protein (CRP) compared to control subjects receiving refined olive oil (70). Another study showed olive oil (25 ml/day for 12 weeks) increased the anti-inflammatory activity of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) (71). In ex vivo experiments using patient-derived samples, EA.",0fcb7c45-2187-40fb-aeec-acc0598767ce
36,introduction36,"hy926 endothelial hybrid cells had significantly decreased expression of ICAM-1 when cocultured with high density lipoprotein (HDL) extracted from subjects receiving olive oil, compared to cocultures containing high density lipoprotein (HDL) from control subjects (71). Taken together, results of these preclinical and clinical studies suggest consumption of foods commonly found in the MD eating pattern attenuates symptoms associated with systemic and gastrointestinal inflammation, a condition that predisposes to Colorectal cancer (CRC).  MD Eating Pattern and Colorectal cancer (CRC)",3b5c288c-6396-44d0-a77e-a25f0bb5e64a
37,methods0,"The main objective of this review was to interrogate the PubMed database for studies that reported on the association between adherence to a MD eating pattern and risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC). We began with the search criteria “Mediterranean diet AND colorectal cancer” with selection limited to clinical studies published during the past 10 years. We then performed secondary screening of preclinical and clinical studies investigating specific food components including cereals and/or grains, vegetables, fruit, legumes, fish and/or fish oil and/or n-3 fatty acid, olive oil, alcohol, red and/or processed meat, potatoes, butter, and sugar and/or sweets. An example query for a secondary search was: “Mediterranean vegetables AND colorectal cancer” or “Mediterranean dairy AND colorectal cancer.” Studies included in this review were primary preclinical or clinical investigations examining the association between the MD and risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC).",01baa73e-4850-48ee-abda-4323cd836024
38,methods1," Studies were included if adherence to the MD was assessed using a validated index (i.e., MD Score (MDS)) or a dietary pattern that coincided with traditional MD parameters. We included studies that investigated individual foods or food components only if they were performed in the context of the MD (i.e., in a Mediterranean population). We excluded reviews or systematic reviews without a meta-analysis, and dietary studies of Colorectal cancer (CRC) that did not focus on a MD eating pattern. Initial search queries generated 223 publications. After filtering by inclusion/exclusion criteria, we identified 40 studies for review.  Preclinical Studies of Colorectal cancer (CRC) Sugars Emphasis on intake of non-refined plant-based foods may improve insulin resistance and decrease circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a proproliferative and antiapoptotic growth factor (72).",ffc0cb48-4f48-44d6-9785-43626d95f3f2
39,methods2," Although receptors for both insulin and IGF-1 are expressed in normal colorectal cells, high circulating levels of these growth factors support malignant transformation (73). Indeed, preclinical studies showed that a combination of insulin and IGF-1 promoted cell cycle progression and proliferation of murine colon cancer MC38 cells in vitro via activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/mitogen activated protein (mitogen activated protein (MAP)) kinase (mitogen activated protein (MAP)K) signaling (74). IGF-1 has also been shown to enhance the growth of MC38 colon cancer allografts in rodent models (75). Therefore, reducing the intake of foods that stimulate circulating and intestinal IGF-1 production may help in reducing the risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC).",275b9604-f93b-4b1c-9ee3-0a949301ca8c
40,methods3,"  Meat and Meat Products Consumption of red and processed meat has been linked to increased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) through production of mutagenic N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) in the gastric environment (76). Approximately 50% of Colorectal cancer (CRC) are known to harbor mutated KRAS, namely a G > A transition at codons 12 or 13, which are characteristic of NOC-mediated DNA alkylation (77). NOCs have also been shown to induce DNA deamination leading to DNA polymerase and mismatch errors, and the formation of abasic sites (78). Evidence suggests guanine residues are more sensitive to N-nitroso deamination than adenine and cytosine (78). Cooking of meat at high temperatures generates heterocyclic amines (heterocyclic amines (HCA)) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) (79, 80).",8f16fdef-808e-4f89-a7e7-73c7dba31a7a
41,methods4," Both heterocyclic amines (HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) have been shown to be carcinogenic in animal studies and associate with the development of various tumor types in humans (81).  Fruits and Vegetables Compounds in fruits and vegetables characteristic of the MD may protect against development of Colorectal cancer (CRC). For example, 3,3′-diindolylmethane (72) and sulforaphane (73) from cruciferous vegetables (i.e., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale) were found to inhibit growth of colon cancer cells through cell cycle arrest. Anthocyanin-rich berry extracts (74) and procyanidins (75) present in red wine, teas, olive oil, and various fruits (i.e., apples, grapes, currants) were also shown to inhibit growth of colorectal (Caco2) cancer cells.",2df0a9ad-c4ae-4ebb-9616-7818afcbe1c2
42,methods5," In HCT-8 Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, the compound (3S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid derived from chicory root increased apoptosis associated with activation of caspases (-3, -8, and -9) (82) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2)-4 [Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX)]; and downregulation of BCL-2 and NF-κB (82). Ginger leaf extracts were also found to reduce cell viability and increase apoptosis in HCT-116, SW480, and LoVo Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells via ERK-dependent upregulation of activating transcription factor 3 (83). In rodent models, dietary supplementation with scallion extracts antagonized growth of CT-26 colon cancer xenografts and enhanced survival rate compared to control-fed animals (84).",0c70c3d5-4341-427a-b06a-773cde26f47d
43,methods6," Molecular effects attributed to the scallion extract included inhibition of proinflammatory COX-2 and iNOS; proliferative cyclin D1 and cellular myelocytomatosis (c-MYC); angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia inducible factor-1α; and invasion matrix metallopeptidase-9 and ICAM-1 factors.  Olive Oil Results of several preclinical studies support a protective action of olive oil against Colorectal cancer (CRC). For example, pretreatment of human HT29 colon cancer cells with a phenolic-rich virgin olive oil extract was shown to markedly reduce hydrogen peroxide-mediated DNA damage (85). Also, the phenol-rich extract improved Caco2 cell barrier function and decreased HT115 cell invasion (85). In human RKO and HCT116 colon cancer cells, treatment with pinoresinol-rich olive oil exerted, respectively, p53- and BAX-dependent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects; while inducing ATM-dependent G2/M arrest (86).",3e7b63e9-d199-49bb-ba7c-8d75e7bfea55
44,methods7," In DLD1 colon cancer cells, hydroxytyrosol decreased antioxidant defense capacity resulting in decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, while attenuating forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) transcriptional activation of target genes via phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) activation (87). Interestingly, hydroxytyrosol did not appear to affect normal colon epithelial cell growth, suggesting that the antiproliferative effect of this compound may be specific to transformed cells (87). The unsaponifiable fraction of olive oil, which consists of squalene, triterpenic or aliphatic alcohols, sterols, tocopherols, and other compounds has also demonstrated anti-Colorectal cancer (CRC) properties.",106bc6b3-893b-4f8d-8609-defe636323ea
45,methods8," In HT29 colon cancer cells, the treatment with the unsaponifiable fraction decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis paralleled by upregulation of p53 and PPARγ; downregulation of COX-2; and accumulation of nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor-α (IKBα), an inhibitor of proinflammatory NF-κB (88).  Another study reported an olive olive-enriched diet (12% olive oil) suppressed intestinal polyp growth in male APCMin/+ mice (89). After 10 weeks, mice on the olive oil diet had significantly less polyps and polyp volume compared to control-fed animals (12% soybean oil). In contrast to control-fed mice, there was no difference between polyp and healthy tissue proliferative activity in mice on the olive oil diet. Growth inhibition of intestinal polyps was attributed to increased apoptotic activity.",f2500a04-3338-47b2-8027-eb1517e065ae
46,methods9," These effects were associated with decreased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is known to induce antiapoptotic genes, and an increased ratio of BAX/Bcl-2. Investigation of estrogen receptor (ER) expression demonstrated an increased ratio of ERβ/ERα in mice on the olive oil diet. Despite high sequence homology to ERα (>60%) (90), ERβ activation is associated with inhibition of cell growth and is thought to act as a negative regulator of estrogenic drive (91). The effects of olive oil in the study utilizing the male APCMin/+ mice demonstrated similar effects with an n-3 fatty acid-rich diet (12% salmon oil) with respect to polyp number and volume, proliferative and apoptotic activity, and ER expression (89).  n-3 Fish Oils In preclinical studies, findings about influence of n-3 PUFA on development of Colorectal cancer (CRC) remain inconclusive.",9b6751a5-cdf3-4330-b53a-94e8c2d23437
47,methods10," For example, a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched diet (3%) administered for 7 weeks to adenomatous popyposis Coli (Apc) knockout female mice (ApcΔ716), decreased polyp multiplicity (92). However, no effects were seen in ApcΔ716 males. This sex-specific effect was also observed in ApcMin/+ mice (Apc mutated), in which a fish oil-enriched diet (0.4, 1.25, or 2.5% of 54.4% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/30.3% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) blend) decreased precancerous polyp multiplicity in females but not in males (93). Conversely, studies with male ApcMin/+ mice administered an eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-rich diet (2.5 or 5% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) reported decreased polyp size and multiplicity compared to male mice fed a control diet (94). Also, in male ApcMin/+ mice, an eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-rich diet (31 g/kg) was found to reduce tumor multiplicity (~50%) compared to animal controls (95).",897c4d4a-61e4-4944-92c9-56fc2e33ad19
48,methods11," Similarly, in male Wistar rats, administration of fish-oil-rich diet (18% by weight for 36 weeks) was found to attenuate 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced preneoplastic lesion and adenoma development compared to control animals given a soybean rich diet (96). The reasons behind these apparently contrasting sex-related results remain largely unknown. Perhaps, interactions between gender and duration and level of intake may influence the cancer response to fish oils. Discrepancy between studies may also be attributed to between-study variation with respect to the use of different transgenic models (i.e., ApcΔ716 vs. APCMin/+) and dietary exposures (i.e., docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) only vs. ethyl esters of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), etc.). Interestingly, in vitro experiments suggested synergistic effects between fish oil and intake of other MD food components (i.e., tomatoes) (97).",4bdd18eb-e52e-4940-ac48-52b3e60eb0a7
49,methods12," Combined treatment with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and lycopene, a bioactive compound derived from tomatoes, synergistically decreased HT-29 colon cancer cell proliferation. The latter effect was attributed to suppression of PI3K/AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, in addition to upregulation of the proapoptotic factors BAX and Fas ligand (97). Thus, studies are needed to clarify the gender-specific effects of fish oils and modifying effects of other key bioactive compounds present in the MD.  Clinical Studies of Colorectal cancer (CRC) Whole Diet and Colorectal Adenoma Cottet et al. (89) utilized cohort data from the European Cancer Prevention study to examine the association between dietary pattern and risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence.",9eacd068-615d-47a3-ae8f-1c28bad07d59
50,methods13," Applying principle components analysis to dietary intake data, investigators identified three distinct dietary patterns: (1) a MD pattern, characterized by high consumption of olive oil, fresh fruit, vegetables, legumes, lean meat and fresh fish intake and low consumption of coffee, meat, beer, fats, whole-grain bread and cereals, and delicatessen; (2) a Western dietary pattern, with high intake of potatoes, fats, delicatessen products, high-fat meat, beer, rice, pasta, refined bread and cereals, nuts, and sodas; and (3) a snacks dietary pattern, with high positive loading for high-fat delicatessen meats, high-fat cheese, desserts and sweets, beer, soda, and mineral water. Multiple logistic regression models adjusted for age, treatment group, and presence of multiple and proximal adenomas at inclusion indicated a decreased risk of CR adenoma recurrence associated with the MD pattern in women.",3b64194b-e3eb-497b-8394-373fe812d41c
51,methods14," No other dietary pattern was associated with risk for women, and none of the patterns displayed an association in men.  A case–control study (n = 564 cases, 1,202 endoscopy negative controls) examined the association between a MD or Paleolithic style diet (PD) pattern and incidence of sporadic colorectal adenomas in a population residing in Minneapolis, St. Paul, MN, USA (98). Adherence to the MD was established with the MD Score (MDS) and a PD was described to have diverse and high intakes of vegetables, fruits, lean meats, fish, nuts, and calcium; and low intakes of red and processed meat, sodium, dairy, grains and starches, baked goods, sugar sweetened beverages, and alcoholic beverages. Both patterns displayed a significant linear trend toward decreased risk across all tertiles (MD, Ptrend = 0.05; PD, Ptrend = 0.02).",4d865c05-402b-4c5d-a5f3-8ba61d02ef28
52,methods15," Separate analyses by sex revealed a decreased risk for both dietary scores for men, but no association was noted for women possibly due to differences in mean age between cancer cases (58.1 ± 9.7) and controls (46.5 ± 6.4).  Whole Diet and Colorectal cancer (CRC) Case Control Table 3 summarizes three case–control studies reported in PubMed and documenting decreased odds of Colorectal cancer (CRC) associated with MD adherence. A study conducted in Athens, Greece examined the effect of the MD on Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in the presence of metabolic MetS (73). Among 250 patients with no previous cancer diagnosis (mean average = 63 ± 12 years), and 250 age–gender-matched controls, MMD Score (MDS) scores were associated with decreased odds of Colorectal cancer (CRC) with 12% lower risk/unit increase in MMD Score (MDS) (P < 0.001).",9f050444-cf6f-4dcb-a7c0-4a490ffd4b81
53,methods16," Investigators stratified data based on presence (MetS+) or absence of (MetS−) of MetS, and noted a 16 and 11% decrease in odds of Colorectal cancer (CRC) for every unit increase in MMD Score (MDS) score for MetS+ and MetS− subjects, respectively (73).

The MD Score (MDS) has been applied to a population from Catania, Italy (n = 338 cases of first Colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis, n = 676 matched healthy controls) to evaluate the association between lifestyle and Colorectal cancer (CRC) (99). Control subjects were more likely to be in the highest tertile of MD Score (MDS) compared to Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (P < 0.001). Compared to “low” MD Score (MDS) scores (tertile 1), both “high” (tertile 3) and “medium” (tertile 2) MD Score (MDS) scores associated with decreased odds of developing Colorectal cancer (CRC).",2a9cc4c3-543e-4399-bbd5-b80c19738968
55,methods20," Higher MD adherence mitigated the increased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) associated with obesity, diabetes, and high alcohol consumption. Conversely, physical activity (PA) did not seem to exert a protective effect.  A pooled analysis of three Italian case–control studies (n = 3,745 Colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, n = 6,804 controls) in populations across several Italian cities (100) concluded that all tertiles of MD Score (MDS) score above reference (MD Score (MDS) score = 0–2) were associated with a decreased risk [11%/unit increase in MD Score (MDS) score, (OR = 0.89, CI95% = 0.86–0.91)] of Colorectal cancer (CRC) with a significant linear trend across all tertiles (Ptrend < 0.0001). In secondary analyses stratified by cancer site, the MD decreased risk of colon, proximal colon, distal colon, and rectal cancer (100) (Table 4).

56,methods23,"6 years) (101) and another reported it for women in the overall European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort (age = 25–70 years) (102). Conversely, data from the Nurse’s Health Study (NHS, women aged 30–55 years) and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS, men aged 40–75 years) (103), and the Women’s Health Initiative (Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)) cohort study (women aged 50–79 years) (104) suggested no effects of the MD on Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk.  Protective effects of a MD eating pattern have been suggested for men in an analysis of the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study (National Cancer Institute (NIH)-AARP) (101).",dfe09f94-70b6-4cc3-a5d7-9705ea1430ee
57,methods24," Investigators used data from a 124-item food-frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) to explore the association between four dietary quality indexes (MD Score (MDS)), Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI))-2005, Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHealthy Eating Index (HEI))-2005, and Recommended Food Score and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, ethnicity, education, BMI, smoking, PA, TEI, and hormone replacement therapy (hormone replacement therapy (HRT)) (women) indicated a decreased risk for men and no effect in women. The mean age of subjects in the first and fifth quantile of MD Score (MDS) adherence was, respectively, 61.5 and 62.6 years for men, and 61.4 and 62.1 years for women (101). When considering specific cancer sites, investigators reported no effect on risk of tumors of the proximal colon for both men and women.",0f40d0ca-8a41-45b6-8300-acaf65421b33
58,methods25," However, adherence to a MD decreased risk of distal colon and rectal cancer in men but not in women. Investigators attributed these sex-specific effects of the MD to differences between how men and women completed the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in the National Cancer Institute (NIH)-AARP study, which may have led to increased measurement errors and non-differential biases among women. Other biases may have been a smaller sample size and fewer cases for women. Possibly, biochemical differences between men and women may influence the etiology of Colorectal cancer (CRC) and the response to a MD.  In support of this hypothesis, data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort supported a decreased risk for women, but no benefit for men (102).",4e7aab2e-92a5-47f1-bf95-19d880d810a5
59,methods26," About 58% of men and ~67% of women participants were below the age of 55 years, and both the MMD Score (MDS) and center specific (CS)-MMD Score (MDS) were applied to food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to establish MD adherence. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for sex, age at enrollment, BMI, PA, education level, and smoking status revealed a decreased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) for all tertiles of MMD Score (MDS) and CS-MMD Score (MDS) scores with a significant linear trend for both scores (MMD Score (MDS), Ptrend = 0.02; CS-MMD Score (MDS), Ptrend = 0.05). For 2-unit increase in index score there was a 3% (MMD Score (MDS)) to 4% (CS-MMD Score (MDS)) reduction in Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. However, neither association reached statistical significance (MMD Score (MDS), HR = 0.96, CI95% = 0.92–1.00; CS-MMD Score (MDS), HR = 0.97, CI95% = 0.93–1.01).",49498400-a622-4754-9b7b-66f88d90a291
60,methods27," There was no association between Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and either score for men, whereas in women, there was a decreased risk associated with higher MMD Score (MDS) but not CS-MMD Score (MDS). A decreased risk was reported for colon, distal colon, and rectal cancers but no association was observed for proximal colon tumors (102).  A study that applied the Italian MD index (IMDI) to data from the Italian cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study (mean ~50 years of age) did not support a gender-specific effect of a MD pattern on Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (24). Rather, higher Italian MD index (IMDI) was associated with a decreased risk in the overall cohort. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for non-alcoholic energy intake, gender, age, BMI, smoking, education and total PA revealed a decreased risk among all tertiles of Italian MD index (IMDI) above reference with a significant linear trend (Ptrend = 0.043).",eef6389e-c8cf-4560-bce8-ca42e4537f8d
61,methods28," Sex-specific analyses revealed a protective effect for both men and women when comparing the highest (6–11) to the lowest (0–1) score of Italian MD index (IMDI). Further analyses indicated a decreased risk for colon, and distal colon but no association was reported for proximal colon and rectal cancers (24).  Results from the NHS (women aged 30–55 years) and HPFS (men aged 40–75 years) (103) studies did not support an association between MD and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Data derived from food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were applied against the aMED and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) diet indexes in Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for a number of variables including age, BMI, alcohol intake, family history, PA, aspirin use, colonoscopy, history of polyps, multivitamin use, smoking, and TEI.",e81e93b2-57e6-4612-a571-f6d8918f8408
62,methods29," Investigators found no association between aMED score and risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) in a pooled analysis of all subjects from both cohorts and in separate analyses for men (HPFS) and women (NHS). However, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was protective in a pooled analysis (RR = 0.80, CI95% = 0.70–0.91) and for women specifically (RR = 0.80, CI95% = 0.67–0.94). There was no association between MD adherence and incidence of either colon or rectal cancer. The disparity in estimated cancer effect between the two MD indexes was attributed at least in part to differences in dietary components. Specifically, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index considered low-fat dairy intake, which was inversely associated with Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, whereas the aMED index did not.",ddee2974-e7fb-4eb8-9d82-fd1ce516ee9a
63,methods30," The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index may have also had more discriminating power by scoring each component on a 5-point scale, compared to the aMED, which scored on a 2-point scale. It is also worth noting that the population under study consisted of health care professionals, whose lifestyle and dietary habits may already be healthier than those of the general public.  Recently, Vargas et al. (104) found no association between MD adherence and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. The association between the aMED, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 indexes and Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence was assessed in postmenopausal women (age 50–79 years) using data derived from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study.",9d1f339a-f732-4296-bbec-7fc3f0ac3251
64,methods31," Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, PA, educational level, smoking status, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) revealed no association between aMED score and Colorectal cancer (CRC)-incidence and -related mortality, whereas Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indexes associated with a lower risk (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010: HR = 0.73, P < 0.01; Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH): HR = 0.78, P = 0.03). There were no overall differences in mean age between women in the fifth (63.5 years) and first (~63.0 years) quantile of aMED adherence.  We identified some studies that investigated the effect of MD on Colorectal cancer (CRC)-related mortality (Table 5). Data from the Multiethnic Cohort (Multiethnic Cohort (MEC)) (105) suggested a decreased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC)-related mortality in women, with a 3% decrease in risk for every standard deviation unit increase in aMED score.",012c673e-b975-4f9d-9c5e-de752ef2ae9d
65,methods32," There was also a decreased risk of all-cause mortality associated with aMED scores in women. There was no association between either Colorectal cancer (CRC)-related or all-cause mortality and aMED scores among men. After correcting for ethnicity, a higher aMED score associated with decreased risk only for African American women and for colon cancer specifically (105). Fung and colleagues (106) also investigated the association between various dietary quality indexes, including aMED, on Colorectal cancer (CRC) survival in women diagnosed with stages I–III Colorectal cancer (CRC) (n = 1,201). Investigators found that only a higher AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 score significantly associated with lower overall mortality, but did not observe an association between aMED score and Colorectal cancer (CRC)-related mortality in a multivariate-adjusted model comparing highest to lowest quintile of MD score.",74fa9d0d-bb3f-4893-aac0-c4d01c8dd499

Overall, results of cohort studies suggest prevention of Colorectal cancer (CRC) by a MD may be influenced by scoring index; tumor site; and other variables related to type of population, country of origin, age, and gender. These variables deserve to be tested.

67,methods34," A meta-analysis conducted by Schwingshackl and Hoffman (107) showed that the combined analysis of case–control and cohort studies decreased Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk by 14% (107). Similar benefits (~17% decreased risk) were confirmed in an updated and more recent analysis by the same authors (108). Another meta-analysis evaluated the influence of a MD eating pattern, without a restriction on fat intake, on Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (109). Adherence to the MD was defined as a pattern that placed no restriction on total fat intake and included two or more of the following components: a high monounsaturated (MUFA):saturated (SFA) ratio; high fruit and vegetable intake; high consumption of legumes; high grain and cereal intake; moderate red wine consumption; moderate consumption of dairy products; and low consumption of meat and meat products with increased intake of fish.",6808205e-0c3d-413a-a74a-7d526f674078

In detail, a case–control study sought to determine dietary factors associated with Colorectal cancer (CRC) among a low-risk population from Southern Italy (110). In a multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking status, and modifications in diet in the previous 10 years, investigators found no association between either vegetable or fruit consumption and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk when comparing quantiles of high intake (vegetable ≥329 g/day; fruit ≥482 g/day) to those of low intake (vegetable ≤236 g/day; fruit ≤307g/day).",8fba790d-91b9-4a45-80cf-3763601ba955
69,methods37," Another study investigated the association between individual components of the MD Score (MDS) and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in the National Cancer Institute (NIH)-AARP study and reported no association for higher intakes of both vegetables (≥1.85 cups/day for men; ≥1.87 cups/day for women) (1 cup = 236.6 g) and fruit (≥2.29 cups/day for men; ≥2.32 cups/day for women) in men and women (101). Similarly, no changes were observed in the prospective analyses of the Italian European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort and the overall European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort for both men and women when comparing the highest tertiles of intake to the lowest (24, 102). In the Italian European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, the range of consumption for the third tertile of intake was 160.7–950.1 and 391.9–3790.5 g/day for vegetables and fruits, respectively (24).",3586ba60-949d-4a97-b63b-3c8dea7221c5
70,methods38," The range of consumption for the first tertile of intake was 0–96.6 g/day (vegetables) and 0–249.2 g/day (fruits). In the entire European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, median consumption levels within the third tertiles of intake for vegetables and fruits were 331.0 and 384.8 g/day, respectively, whereas median levels for the first tertiles were 88.6 and 83.1 g/day, respectively (102). In contrast, vegetable and fruit intake were associated with decreased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) in a pooled analysis of three Italian case–control studies conducted by Rosato et al. (100). However, this analysis may have been somewhat skewed since it included nut intake with fruits to estimate adherence to a MD pattern based on MD Score (MDS).

For example, a study reported that subjects on a vegetarian diet (30 g fiber/day as non-starch polysaccharides) or a red meat and high fiber diet (420 g red meat + 30 g fiber/day), had significantly higher levels of the NOC-specific DNA adduct O(6)-carboxymethyl guanine compared to individuals on a high red meat diet with no fiber (420 g/day for 15 days) (76). Moreover, analyses of data derived from the Spanish cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study indicated that consumption of pro-NOC forming compounds was lower in the MD group compared with groups adopting other dietary patterns (111).",29f49a93-6453-4c96-a06f-2455e2ffdd39
72,methods41,"  Higher intake of fiber tends to accelerate transit time through the digestive system, thereby reducing exposure of the large intestine to potential carcinogens [i.e., secondary bile acids (BAs), NOC] (112). In support of a preventative role for fiber against Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prospective analysis of data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Remarkably, doubling fiber consumption in subjects with low intake reduced Colorectal cancer (CRC) by ~40% (113). Another study in men and women from the USA reported that subjects in the highest quintile of fiber intake had a 27% lower risk of developing adenomas, compared to subjects in the lowest quintile of intake (114).  Cereals, Whole Grains, and Legumes Only a small number of studies examined the effects of cereals, grains, and legumes on Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (Table 8).",1e84ca95-3b76-4bae-873e-8a11e4ec7921
73,methods42," In a low Colorectal cancer (CRC)-risk population from Southern Italy, investigators found no protective effects of cereal intake when comparing individuals with higher (≥267 g/day) to lower (≤238 g/day) intake (110). In contrast, the National Cancer Institute (NIH)-AARP cohort study found that whole grain intake was associated with a decreased risk for men (≥1.19 oz/day), but not women (≥0.98 oz/day) (1 oz = 28.35 g) whereas legumes did not influence Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk for either men (≥0.09 cups/day) or women (≥0.06 cups/day) (101).

Cereal grain intake did not change Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk for the overall European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, and in separate analyses for men and women when comparing the third (median = 309.9 g/day) to the first (122.1 g/day) tertile of intake (102). Legume intake (median 30.1 g/day) was reported to have no effect on Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk when compared to no consumption in the overall European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort and in men, whereas there was an increased risk reported in women with higher legume consumption (102).",ff396d8d-aa82-47c2-b3e2-8c2494251de1

Fish and Meat Table 9 summarizes results of studies that investigated the association between fish and meat consumption and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. In a population from Southern Italy, there was no association between higher intake of fresh meat (88–131 g/day), beef (≥22 g/day), processed meat (≥3 g/day), and fish (≥51 g/day) (110). However, in the National Cancer Institute (NIH)-AARP cohort, increased consumption of red and processed meat (men, ≥3 oz/day; women, ≥1.8 oz/day) increased risk for women, whereas no association was observed for men (101). In the same study, fish consumption (men, ≥0.66 oz/day; women, ≥0.53 oz/day) had no effect in either men or women.

In the same study, the lack of association between meat consumption and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk was confirmed for both men and women. Interestingly, a high intake of fish appeared to be protective only for men (102). In a pooled analysis of Italian case–control studies, an increased risk was reported for consumption of meat and meat products (100). In contrast, a decreased risk was reported for fish consumption.  Although red and processed meat have historically been considered to play a causative role in Colorectal cancer (CRC) development (115), we only identified two studies indicating an increased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) with higher meat consumption (100, 101).",dcff455c-fdce-4c2a-9191-cff302e07ee1
78,methods49," Red and processed meat have been classified by The World Health Organization and International Agency for the Research on Cancer (116, 117) as group 2A (“probably carcinogenic to humans”) and group 1 (“carcinogenic to humans”) carcinogens, respectively. Observational and mechanistic evidence from over 800 scientific articles support the recommendation from these agencies that intake of processed meat contributes to colorectal and gastric cancers. Turner and Lloyd (115) sought to further investigate the mechanistic link between red meat and Colorectal cancer (CRC) in a systematic review of forty studies using animal and cell culture models. These investigators concluded that most of the studies delivered meat or meat-derived compounds at doses that appeared to be significantly higher than those commonly present in the human diet. Interestingly, the presence of certain dietary compounds (i.e.",9bd8dcfe-bfab-4e39-b229-a9ac8eed97b4
79,methods50,", chlorophyll, fermentable fiber, calcium carbonate, among others), fruits, and vegetables, and whole grains tended to mitigate, and in some instances even antagonize, the procarcinogenic effects of meat and meat-derived compounds. Possibly, adherence to a whole MD pattern may explain the reduced association between meat consumption alone and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in certain Mediterranean populations.  Fats Key elements of the MD include reduced consumption of saturated (SFA) from butter and higher intake of monounsaturated (MUFA) from olive oil. Although olive oil consumption is recommended at every meal in the MD eating pattern, only two studies have investigated its specific effect on Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (24, 118) (Table 10). Data derived from case–control studies conducted throughout six geographical areas of Italy (118) indicated a decreased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) associated with olive oil intake when comparing higher intake levels (≥43.",3a2a3848-e781-442f-a197-e4577a1ab28a
80,methods51,"4 g/day) to lower (≤23.4 g/day). However, no association was reported for intake of butter ≥3.2 g/day compared to ≤1.0 g/day. Also, no association was reported for butter intake and colon or rectal cancer (118). In keeping with the latter results, analyses of the Italian cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study found no association between higher intakes of either olive oil (29.9–160.4 g/day) or butter (1.4–101.1 g/day) and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (24). First tertiles of intake were 0–19.3 g/day for olive oil and 0–0.2 g/day for butter.

81,methods54," Interestingly, cumulative evidence from three studies (Table 10) suggests that consumption of dairy products may actually be protective (100, 102, 110). For example, a study in a Southern Italian population (average 34–90 years) reported a decreased risk associated with higher (≥263 g/day) compared to lower (≤130 g/day) dairy consumption, which showed a significant linear trend across tertiles (Ptrend = 0.05) (110). Similarly, a decreased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) associated with dairy intake was reported in a pooled analysis within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort when comparing the third (median = 529.8 g/day) to the first (median = 114.0 g/day) tertile of intake. Furthermore, a decreased risk was noted for both men and women in individual analyses by gender (102).",b2591048-9684-49f7-8652-92b7b12a3a18
82,methods55," Similar results were reported in the pooled analysis of Italian case–control studies, in which low consumption of dairy was associated with increased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) (100). Overall, these data suggest that the impact of dairy consumption in the context of a MD on Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk needs to be further examined to better define recommended intakes and potential complications associated with intake of saturated (SFA) on cardiovascular diseases.  Potatoes and Sugars Table 10 summarizes the results of studies that investigated the association between intake of sugars and potatoes on Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. A 175% increase in risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) was reported among individuals from Southern Italy (34–90 years) with the highest intake of foods with refined sugars (≥26 g/day), and a significant linear trend was observed across tertiles of intake (Ptrend = 0.01) (110).",c33bed9e-b26b-470b-8456-014f0e557844
83,methods56," This study however, reported no association between potato consumption (≥22 g/day) and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (110). Agnoli et al. (24) reported on soft drink consumption in the Italian cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, which we used here as a proxy for sugar intake. In a pooled analysis of men and women, no association was noted between higher consumption of soft drinks (14.4–3,000 g/day) and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk when compared to no intake (24). Similarly, no association was found for higher intake levels of potatoes (34.7–420.9 g/day) (24).  Alcohol Alcohol intake is considered a risk factor for Colorectal cancer (CRC) (119). Therefore, the recommendation for moderate alcohol consumption in the MD eating pattern has been called into question. A possible confounder when studying the association between alcohol intake and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is the type of alcohol consumed.",1773bb10-9d32-439b-bfd5-5989ca9aeb27
84,methods57," Although the MD recommends moderate consumption of red wine, several studies looked at total alcohol consumption (Table 10). For example, one study that examined red wine intake in an unadjusted model reported no change in risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) associated with low (0.25 l/day) consumption. However, medium (0.5 l/day) and high (>0.5 l/day) wine intakes were associated with increased risk compared to no consumption, and there was a significant linear trend across tertiles (Ptrend = 0.006). On the other hand, using an adjusted model, no significant association was noted for “low” (tertile 2), “medium” (tertile 3), or “high” (tertile 4) intake (110). Similarly, analyses of data from the National Cancer Institute (NIH)-AARP study indicated no association between alcohol consumption (5–25 g/day) and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk for either men or women (101).",31fe2b27-ef68-4bc2-8e11-b664cc076414
85,methods58,"  A pooled analysis of men and women from the Italian cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, found no associated risk for any category of alcohol intake (24). Similar conclusions were reached in a pooled analysis of men and women from the overall European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort when comparing the third (median = 23.1 g/day) to the first (0.4 g/day) tertile of intake (102). However, separate analyses revealed both a gender- and dose-dependent effect. In men, there was no association with Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk for the middle tertile of alcohol intake (median intake = 5.6 g/day), whereas an increased risk was observed for the highest tertile (median = 23.1 g/day). In women, neither category of intake was associated with higher risk (102).  To evaluate the association between Colorectal cancer (CRC) and alcohol consumption (type and quantity), Kontou et al.",c1104968-2447-4e3f-a6b2-126a2776b905
86,methods59," conducted a case–control study with patients from the Saint Savvas Cancer Hospital and Alexandra General Hospital, Athens, Greece (119). Using an adjusted model, these investigators estimated that moderate alcohol intake (12–35 g/day) was associated with decreased Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk; higher levels (36–48 g/day) had no association, whereas the highest level of intake (> 48 g/day) was associated with increased risk (119). Individual analysis by gender indicated similar results for both men and women, except that the increased risk associated with intake >48 g/day was not significant for women.  In a case–control study involving Italian patients from Catania, Sicily, investigators examined the impact of adherence to a MD eating pattern and level of alcohol consumption (12–35, 36–48, and >48 g/day) on risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) (99).",5215c744-aa02-4895-b9ae-7599ef43b42f
87,methods60," For subjects with low or high adherence to the MD, alcohol consumption of 12–35 or 36–48 g/day was not associated with Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. However, an increased risk was reported for subjects with low adherence to the MD and high alcohol consumption (>48 g/day), whereas at this level of alcohol intake there was no association in subjects with high adherence to the MD. These data suggested that following a MD eating pattern may mitigate some of the risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) associated with higher alcohol intake (99).  Rosato et al. directly addressed the issue regarding alcohol quantity by calculating the associated odds ratio of “moderate” consumption using “high” and “no” consumption as reference quantiles (100). Moderate consumption was defined as consumption higher than zero but below or equal to the study- and sex-specific median values, whereas high consumption was defined as being above the median value.",f25de37d-3169-4b8d-8bd5-3a850242f21d
88,methods61," Based on these definitions, moderate consumption had no association with Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk compared to no or high consumption (100). ",f9de0512-b4cc-4b15-b7d6-29463a9be3c6
89,discussion0,"Adherence to a MD and consumption of certain compounds characteristic of this eating pattern may protect against the development of Colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In general, case–control studies conducted in Mediterranean populations consistently supported decreased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) when using the MD Score (MDS) and MMD Score (MDS) scoring systems (73, 99, 100). On the other hand, there have been discrepancies in conclusions from cohort studies, with one study reporting a decreased risk in both sexes (24); two studies indicating no effect (103, 104); and two studies reporting sex-specific effects for men (101) and women (102). These inconsistencies across cohort studies may be related to the different scoring indexes utilized to determine MD adherence.",7594b1cd-ef7f-486f-9532-908a053479a8
90,discussion1," For example, cohort studies that utilized the MD Score (MDS), MMD Score (MDS), and Italian MD index (IMDI) found a protective effect for men (101), women (102), and both sexes (24), respectively. In contrast, cohort studies employing the aMED failed to identify any protective effect associated with MD adherence (103, 104). The MD Score (MDS) and MMD Score (MDS) differ in that the MMD Score (MDS) accounts for PUFA in the lipid ratio. We found no case–control studies that utilized either the aMED or Italian MD index (IMDI) systems, which differ in regard to food categories (aMED and Italian MD index (IMDI)); accepted range of alcohol intake (aMED and Italian MD index (IMDI)); and method to determine point allocation (Italian MD index (IMDI)). In spite of these inconsistencies, results of observational studies and three meta-analyses available in PubMed point to a decreased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) associated with adherence to a MD.",5e2a73c8-2821-4671-85a1-3a8ac35e3b62
91,discussion2," The results from the meta-analyses provide more robust estimates than those derived from individual studies (e.g., case–control, cohorts).  A decreased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) is generally reported for Mediterranean inhabitants that have traditionally followed a MD eating pattern (e.g., Italians, Greeks, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, Italian European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort) (24, 73, 99, 100, 102). Perhaps not surprisingly, studies reporting no association generally dealt with populations where the MD eating pattern was not as widely followed, such as the USA (NHS, HPFS, Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)) (103, 104). A determining factor in assessing adherence to, and efficacy of, a MD eating pattern may be differences in reference intake levels (e.g., quantiles) between Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean groups (i.e.",46e72a30-1823-4b0f-9ac0-f9d18b408b82
92,discussion3,", National Cancer Institute (NIH)-AARP, NHS, Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)). This is an important consideration when interpreting results using indexes that distinguish levels of intake based on study-specific distributions, rather than predetermined absolute values. Thus, investigations conducted with Mediterranean populations (i.e., Italy, Greece, etc.) may have inherently higher cut off points for certain quantiles of intake than studies conducted with non-Mediterranean subjects (i.e., the USA). Furthermore, when MD indexes are applied against food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that assess intake over a relatively short period of time (previous 12 months), results may be skewed by confounding effects due to previous dietary practices. Therefore, the potential health benefits of adopting a MD pattern may not be as measurable for study participants that have adhered to undesirable dietary practices for the majority of their lifetime.",1f930bb6-ba6a-4b0d-829c-82544d9a1311
93,discussion4,"  Age appears to be another determining factor in regard to the sex-specific effects of a MD. The study by Reedy and colleagues (101) and data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) cohort (104) suggested no association between MD adherence and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in women of a relatively older age (~62 years). In contrast, data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort suggested a decreased risk in women (102). However, the majority of women in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) were younger, with ~67% of the subjects under the age of 55 years. In line with the hypothesis that a MD pattern has a greater impact in younger individuals are the results from the Italian European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort where the mean age of participants was ~50 years and MD adherence was reported to be protective for both sexes (24).",4a33e2f4-3929-4c47-93d5-2482e622bb03
94,discussion5," These results suggest that lifetime adherence to a MD may exert beneficial effects not easily achievable in older groups. To complicate the interpretation of data related to interactions between age and MD adherence are results of one study (103) indicating that even in a relatively young population of women (NHS, 30–55 years of age) there was no association between aMED score and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. A possible explanation for the lack of an association in this study is the confounding effect imparted by the type of population analyzed, which consisted of health care professionals that likely already adhered to healthier lifestyles.  Overall, results from this review indicate the protective effect of the MD in regard to Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk may be specific to the distal colon. The majority of studies investigating proximal colon cancer (proximal colon cancer (PCC)) incidence reported no effect, except for the study of Rosato et al.",807bb99e-262f-47b0-8044-8491afcd7e89
95,discussion6," that reported a decreased risk (100). On the other hand, all of the studies investigating distal colon cancer (distal colon cancer (DCC)) noted a decreased risk with MD adherence. This disparity in the preventive effects of the MD on proximal colon cancer (PCC) versus distal colon cancer (DCC) may be due to biological differences in the colonic mucosa of these regions, which are acquired in utero and in postnatal development, and may influenced epigenetically by environmental factors such as dietary exposures that occur later in life (120). There could also be differences in the presence of procarcinogenic factors between the ascending and descending colon (120).  Frontiers in Colorectal cancer (CRC) Research Epigenetics of Colorectal cancer (CRC) Experimental evidence suggests an important role of epigenetic modifications in the development of Colorectal cancer (CRC) (121–123).",473d8f6a-a65b-4ad7-997d-6db07de60f18
96,discussion7," Epigenetic modifications relate to changes in methylation of cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides (DNA methylation), histone-tail posttranslational modifications, and expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) (123). To date, no studies have detailed the epigenome of individuals adhering to a MD eating pattern. In this section, we briefly review some of the epigenetic marks commonly observed in Colorectal cancer (CRC). Then, we highlight some of the epigenetic modifications elicited by bioactive compounds commonly present in MD foods.  DNA Methylation DNA methylation refers to the covalent attachment of a methyl group to the five position of a cytosine molecule within a CpG dinucleotide in DNA. These methylation reactions are catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), of which three main isoforms exist: DNMT1, also known as the maintenance methyltransferase; and DNMT3a and 3b, which contribute to de novo methylation.",25d16445-41c2-4af4-97db-163227e4d651
97,discussion8," The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) Colorectal cancer (CRC) subtype associates with a high frequency of CpG hypermethylation and is diagnosed based on the methylation status of various genes that participate in regulation of calcium transport (CACNA1G), proliferation (IGF2), Wnt signaling (NEUROG1), transcription activity (RUNX3), and suppression of cytokine signaling (124, 125). Hypermethylation of MLH1 involved in DNA mismatch repair, and TIMP3, which inhibits metalloproteinases, also associate with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) phenotype (126).  Approximately 12–17% of all Colorectal cancer (CRC) have microsatellite instability (MSI) (123), of which 80% harbor silenced mismatch repair pathways as a result of biallelic hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene. Loss of MLH1 expression potentiates replication errors in microsatellite sequences (123).",bcb449d5-1757-4d56-bdea-cab948cd796d
98,discussion9," Hypermethylation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation (CDKN2A/p16/MTSI) and repair of mutagenic DNA lesions (MGMT) contributes to formation of adenomatous polyps and progression through the adenoma–carcinoma sequence (127–134). Loss of MGMT is associated with G > A KRAS mutations commonly observed in Colorectal cancer (CRC) (133). DNA methylation also plays a role in Colorectal cancer (CRC) via silencing of genes associated with the β-catenin/Wnt (APC, SFRP, CDX2, MCC), p53 (IGFBP7) and cell cycle control (CDKN2A) pathways (123). Conversely, DNA hypomethylation has been suggested to play a role in Colorectal cancer (CRC) through activation of proto-oncogenes and chromosomal instability (CIN) (135, 136). For example, hypomethylation of the transposable DNA element long interspersed nuclear element-1 has been shown to activate the MET, RAB3IP, and CHRM3 proto-oncogenes in Colorectal cancer (CRC) metastases (136). Mirchev et al.",b45f8851-d19d-477e-81be-8f2739bf731e
99,discussion10," characterized the association between DNA methylation status of the MLH1, p16INK, TIMP3, and TPEF genes and various clinicomorphological features of Colorectal cancer (CRC) (126). These investigators reported hypermethylation of MLH1 and p16INK in elderly patients; MLH1, p16INK, and TIMP3 in proximal tumors; and p16INK in poorly differentiated tumors.  The farnesoid receptor X (farnesoid receptor X (FXR)) is a nuclear transcription factor that has been recognized as a tumor suppressor protein in intestinal mucosa. The farnesoid receptor X (FXR) regulates BA homeostasis by controlling intestinal reabsorption, enterohepatic circulation, hepatic de novo synthesis, and intracellular regulation of BA (137–139).",8bf1ca99-1cab-4780-bb8f-e717b10dcbde
100,discussion11," farnesoid receptor X (FXR) deficiency results in enhanced tumor development in APCMin/+ mice (140), whereas adenoviral-mediated overexpression of constitutively active farnesoid receptor X (FXR) in HT29 xenografts inhibits tumor growth via the induction of the proapoptotic FAS, BAK1, p21, KLF4, FADD, CASP9, and p27 genes; and downregulation of antiapoptotic BCL2 and proinflammatory TNFα (141). The tumor suppressor activity of farnesoid receptor X (FXR) is likely related to both BA-dependent (i.e., protection from BA-mediated inflammation and toxicity) and BA-independent (i.e., gut permeability, Wnt/β-catenin signaling) functions (142). Bailey et al. investigated the regulation of farnesoid receptor X (FXR) at various stages of Colorectal cancer (CRC) development by comparing polyp (n = 32) and adenocarcinoma tissue (stages I–IV, n = 43, 39, 68, and 9, respectively) to normal colon tissue (n = 238) (142).",f59db7f9-d1bf-4ad1-b9be-a6073acfc4df
101,discussion12," Compared to healthy colon tissue, farnesoid receptor X (FXR) function and expression were decreased in polyps and precancerous lesions, whereas expression was silenced mostly at later tumor stages (I–IV). Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that ~12% of colon cancers have hypermethylated nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4 (NR1H4) gene, which encodes for farnesoid receptor X (FXR) (142). Interestingly, inhibition of DNMT1 activity with 5-azacytadine as well as silencing of KRAS with short-interfering RNA (siRNA) has been shown to significantly increase farnesoid receptor X (FXR) expression (142). The latter data suggest the role of epigenetic mechanisms as regulators of farnesoid receptor X (FXR) expression and susceptibility to Colorectal cancer (CRC).  Recently, our laboratory reported that loss of APC predisposed to silencing of farnesoid receptor X (FXR) via CpG hypermethylation in colonic mucosa of APCMin/+ mice and in HCT-116 human colon cancer cells (143).",ce6cc41f-5f07-4dd4-b151-c701cd2fd75d
102,discussion13," In APCMin/+ mice, CpG methylation of the farnesoid receptor X (FXR) promoter was linked to decreased expression of farnesoid receptor X (FXR) and ileal bile acid-binding protein (ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP)) and short heterodimer partner (short heterodimer partner (SHP)), two transcriptional targets of farnesoid receptor X (FXR); and increased expression of COX-2. In HCT-116 cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown of APC increased c-MYC, while decreasing farnesoid receptor X (FXR), expression. Treatment of APC knockout cells (HCT-116) with deoxycholic acid (deoxycholic acid (DCA)), a secondary BA, further reduced farnesoid receptor X (FXR) expression. However, treatment of wild-type HCT-116, but not HT-29, cells with deoxycholic acid (DCA) induced farnesoid receptor X (FXR), which was associated with decreased promoter methylation.",93cbe762-2e42-4aab-8ea1-4c7befbf1046
103,discussion14," These cumulative results suggested that loss of APC function might favor epigenetic silencing of farnesoid receptor X (FXR), leading to decreased expression of factors involved in BA homeostasis (i.e., ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP), short heterodimer partner (SHP)), and activation of others that contribute to inflammation (COX-2) and proliferation (c-MYC) (143). It remains largely unknown how food components that are common to the MD eating pattern alter epigenetically the APC-farnesoid receptor X (FXR) axis. This hypothesis deserves to be tested.  Olive oil contains the phenolic compounds tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), oleuropein, quercetin, and rutin. In HT-29 colon cancer cells with inactivated APC, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (20 µM) was shown to lower p16INK methylation after 6 days in cell culture conditions (144).",fcd2b1a9-6e0c-4f23-8a0b-360f7a52c09b
104,discussion15," Similar effects have been observed in RKO colon cancer cells treated with quercetin, which dose-dependently decreased p16INK promoter methylation and restored p16INK gene expression (145). The type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) is a tumor suppressor encoded by CNR1 with antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (146). Loss of CB1 facilitates adenoma formation in APCMin/+ mice (147). In colon cancer Caco2 cells, Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and the individual compounds hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein were shown to increase CNR1 and CB1 expression associated with decreased methylation of the CNR1 gene (148). Rats given Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (10 days) had increased CB1 mRNA expression in colonic mucosa compared to controls. Overall, these observations suggest compounds commonly found in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) possess antagonistic properties against methylation of tumor suppressor genes.",83bd00e7-4ec9-487b-a4da-e5d35fbf1f0f
105,discussion16,"  The production of SCFAs, such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate through fermentation of fiber by gut microbiota may contribute to preventing the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Colorectal cancer (CRC) (149). In vitro fermentation studies indicated that fiber sources commonly present in the MD support higher production of butyrate compared to fiber found in the Scandinavian dietary pattern (150). Preclinical studies demonstrated butyrate had anti-Colorectal cancer (CRC) activity associated with prevention of DNA methylation. For example, in LS174T colon cancer cells, butyrate decreased cell proliferation and rescued apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (associated speck like protein (ASC)), a proapoptotic protein silenced by DNA methylation in Colorectal cancer (CRC) (151). In HT-29 colon cancer cells, butyrate was found to protect against genotoxicity induced by the secondary bile deoxycholic acid (DCA) (152), and lower DNMT1 levels (153).",c251ae82-f247-4ef6-b172-18625b667df4
106,discussion17," There was also evidence to suggest a synergistic effect between butyrate and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in regard to modulation of DNA methylation. In HCT-116 colon cancer cells, the combination of butyrate and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) significantly reduced methylation of genes encoding the proapoptotic Bcl2l11, Cideb, Dapk1, Ltbr, and Tnfrsf2. Treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) alone also significantly reduced methylation of genes encoding Cideb, Dapk1, and Tnfrsf25, suggesting an association between n-3 fish oil and inhibition of DNMT activity (154).  A recent study (155) examined changes in methylation between baseline and 5 years postintervention in peripheral blood cells from patients (n = 36) in the PREDIMED-Navarra study. This study was a randomized, controlled, parallel trial with three groups of intervention in high cardiovascular risk volunteers, two with a MD and one low-fat control group.",75afb464-efa7-42cb-b4d7-d3db30a8b1fd
107,discussion18," Eight genes related to inflammation and immune-competence (EEF2, COL18A1, IL4I1, LEPR, PLAGL1, IFRD1, mitogen activated protein (mitogen activated protein (MAP)) kinase (mitogen activated protein (MAP)K)APK2, PPARGC1B) had changes in their DNA methylation levels that correlated with adherence to the MD. Interestingly, increased EEF2 methylation levels positively correlated with reduced concentrations of inflammatory TNFα and C reactive protein (CRP). These data support the idea that key components of the MD eating pattern (e.g., olive oil, fiber, fish oils) tend to exert protective, likely combinatorial, effects against DNA methylation changes associated with inflammation and Colorectal cancer (CRC).  Histone Modifications Histone posttranslational modifications (e.g., methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, phosphorylation) influence compaction of chromatin and whether it is in an active or inactive state (123).",0dbe4e25-af23-4037-8e1f-da1aef350e5a
108,discussion19," For example, di- and tri-methylation of histone-3 (H3) lysine 4 (K4) (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, respectively) and acetylation of H3 (H3Ac) and H4 (H4Ac) are commonly associated with relaxed chromatin and a transcriptionally permissive state. Conversely, tri-methylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) are usually associated with chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression (156). Several examples of gene regulation via histone modification have been observed in the context of Colorectal cancer (CRC). Wnt family member 5A (Wnt5a), a factor involved in regulation of the Wnt pathway, was found to be downregulated in metastatic Colorectal cancer (CRC). In the SW620 human metastatic Colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line, downregulation of Wnt5a was linked to enrichment of H3K27me3 in addition to decreased levels of H3K4me2, and loss of H3Ac and H4Ac (157).",1683cc9d-5559-4436-98f4-425893aad2a6
109,discussion20," The increase of H3Ac, H4Ac and H3K4me2 after butyrate treatment in SW620 cells confirmed the involvement of histone modifications in the transcriptional regulation of Wnt5a. Deacetylation of H3K9 was associated with loss of the calcium-sensing receptor in Colorectal cancer (CRC) (158). In HCT116 human colon cancer cells, the deleted in colon cancer (distal colon cancer (DCC)) gene sequence was enriched with the repressive marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, whereas the permissive mark H3K4me3 was absent (159). Studies in HCT116 and SW480 Colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines reported decreased levels of H3K4me3 and increased H3K27 associated with downregulation of mucin-like protocadherin (160). Based on these observations, monitoring of histone posttranslational modifications may prove useful hints as prognostic biomarkers of efficacy for the MD eating pattern against Colorectal cancer (CRC).",b532e07b-f571-4146-b717-621aebd95457
110,discussion21," For example, histone trimethylation at H3K4, H3K9 and H4K20 was reported to be associated with better prognosis in early-stage Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in regard to overall survival and tumor recurrence (161).  Butyrate is widely recognized as a histone deacetylase (histone deacetylase (HDAC)) inhibitor (162). In HT-29 colon cancer cells, butyrate prevented TNFα-mediated activation of COX-2 transcription and protein synthesis similar to trichostatin-A, a synthetic high-affinity histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (163). In HCT-116 cells, butyrate significantly increased global H3Ac compared to untreated cells (154). In RKO, HCT-116, and HT-29 Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, sodium butyrate (5 mM) was found to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, which were linked to inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and decreased histone deacetylase (HDAC)1, DNMT1, and surviving protein (153).",164adaa5-009d-4234-a6e7-748ad5e047b7
111,discussion22," Interestingly, the epigenetic effects of butyrate may be dependent on cellular energetics (164). In normal colonocytes, butyrate stimulates cell growth due to its preferential utilization as a fuel source via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (164). However, in malignant cells, cellular energetics are deregulated in a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect, a phenotype that is characterized by increased utilization of glucose and glycolytic metabolism and decreased mitochondrial oxidation (165, 166). As a result of downregulated mitochondrial metabolism, butyrate may accumulate and exert epigenetic modulation (164). These data further highlight the potential role of fiber common to the MD as a preventative of Colorectal cancer (CRC).  Non-Coding RNAs Non-coding RNA refers to RNA transcripts that are not translated into proteins, and are usually classified into two groups. Short ncRNA (<30 nucleotides) include microRNAs (miRNAs), siRNAs, and piwi-interacting RNAs.",cef86ecc-ac85-403b-bd69-77fa4cc0d097
112,discussion23," Long ncRNA (>300 nucleotides) include the long intergenic ncRNA which target specific loci to regulate expression (167). Other examples of ncRNA include transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA. The best classified ncRNAs in regard to cancer development are miRs, which negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by either signaling the destruction of mRNA transcripts or blocking their translation into proteins (168). Examples of aberrant miR activity have been reported in both the traditional “adenoma–carcinoma” and “serrated” model of Colorectal cancer (CRC).",78e448ad-2f02-4204-a47c-98ccaa8a22c4
113,discussion24," For instance, in the traditional model, dysregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling was associated with the miR-17-92a cluster, miR-135b, miR-143, and miR-145; genes involved in the RAS/mitogen activated protein (mitogen activated protein (MAP)) kinase (mitogen activated protein (MAP)K) were regulated by miR-143, let-7, miR-21, and miR-31; genes involved in the Pi3K/Akt pathway appeared to be controlled by miR-1, miR-21, and miR-143; and p53 was regulated by miR-34a/b/c, miR-133a, miR-143, and miR-145 (123).  Butyrate has been found to inhibit expression of the proliferative miR-92a in HCT-116 cells by decreasing expression of c-Myc, leading to increased rates of apoptosis (169). Another study in HCT-116 cells showed that butyrate treatment modulated the expression of 44 miRs including members of the miR-106b family involved in p21 regulation (170).",5a6af11b-64d0-4974-bdd5-c958be51c901
114,discussion25," In HT-29 cells, a combination of quercetin and resveratrol, polyphenolic compounds commonly found in the MD, decreased expression of oncogenic miR-27a; induced caspase activation; and decreased ROS formation (171). In rats, an Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-enriched diet was found to lower the expression of miR-23a and miR-301a (~50%) compared to control-fed animals (148). Fish oil was shown to protect against azoxymethane-induced miRNA deregulation in an AOM rat model (172).  Turning to the effects of a whole MD, a recent study investigated the influence of an eight-week MD eating pattern for weight loss [the RESMENA (reduction of MetS in Navarra, Spain) diet] on expression of inflammation-related miRNA and genes in white blood cells (WBCs) from individuals (age = 48.84 ± 10.02 years; BMI = 35.41 ± 4.42) with MetS. The expression of miR-155-3p was decreased in WBC, whereas Let-7b was strongly upregulated as a consequence of dietary intervention.",143af0f4-9c2b-4851-b980-721ca6de8490
115,discussion26," Given the known repressive functions of members of the Let-7 family against cellular processes associated with cancer, the latter results highlighted the concept that a MD eating pattern may protect against Colorectal cancer (CRC) in particular in overweight or obese individuals (173).  Taken together, aberrant epigenetic processes play a major role in Colorectal cancer (CRC) development and progression. Given the myriad of bioactive compounds found in the MD eating pattern and the accumulating evidence suggesting epigenetic effects of such compounds, future investigations should characterize the epigenome, and subsequent down-stream phenotypes, of subjects adhering to a MD. Possibly, the protective role of the MD against Colorectal cancer (CRC) could be due to the sum of epigenetic modifications elicited by a combination of bioactive food components characteristic of this dietary patter.",e1d59f16-de80-429a-8353-8642c7c5212d
116,discussion27,"  Microbiome and Colorectal cancer (CRC) At the time of this writing, only a few investigations have focused on the relationship between MD adherence and changes in gut microbiota. Recently, the gut microbiome has emerged as a key factor in both the prevention and etiology of Colorectal cancer (CRC) (174), In an analysis of 153 individuals habitually following omnivore, vegetarian or vegan diets, identification of a MD pattern was associated with beneficial changes in the host microbiome including increased SCFA production and abundance of Prevotella and fiber-degrading Firmicutes (175). Conversely, lower adherence to the MD was associated with increased urinary trimethylamine levels, which has been linked to abundance of L-Ruminococcus, a bug commonly linked to CD susceptibility in mice.",5c3a48b6-bec4-4341-8fe1-d75cdf58a867
117,discussion28," A clinical trial in healthy male volunteers indicated that daily intake of red wine polyphenols for 4 weeks significantly increased the number of Enterococcus, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides uniformis, Eggerthella lenta, and Blautia coccoides-Eubacterium rectale, as indicated by analysis of fecal samples (176). Fruit intake has been associated with increased Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, which are considered beneficial to the host (177). Intake of fruits and vegetables, in addition to flavonoid intake, were negatively associated with Clostridium histolyticum/perfringens groups, whereas starch intake was associated with total bacterial number and fiber consumption was positively correlated with Bacteroides/Prevotella (178). In C57BL/6J mice, olive oil supplementation has been associated with growth of members of the Bacteroidaceae family compared to mice supplemented with palm oil or given a mixture of flaxseed and fish oil (179).",fd8de039-bc39-4a5a-9fa1-7c3ae2d8e1fe
118,discussion29,"  In rats consuming a diet with protein contributing 20% of TEI, meat protein intake (from beef, pork, or fish) was associated with higher relative abundance of Lactobacillus, which was generally considered beneficial, but lower relative abundance of SCFA and SCFA-producing bacteria including Fusobacterium, and Prevotella, compared to soy-protein fed rats (180). Additionally, an association has been identified between red meat consumption and enrichment of Bacteroides massiliensis, Alistipes finegoldii, and Bilophila wadsworthia bacteria, which have been implicated in Colorectal cancer (CRC) etiology (181). Increased Bacteroides, which has been observed in Colorectal cancer (CRC), was also associated with increased consumption of animal protein and saturated fat. The latter are characteristic of a Western style diet pattern (181).",c1cf1a96-2e56-40f9-be9b-70fadd178c08
119,discussion30,"  Conclusion We have summarized evidence suggesting the MD may reduce Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk by affecting known biological factors associated with inflammation, genetic and epigenetic processes, and the host microbiome. However, it should be noted that observed changes in biomarkers may not necessarily translate to an improved clinical outcome. This is reflected in the disparity of health effects we observed among the observational studies. Case–control studies of the MD consistently reported a decreased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC), whereas results of cohort studies were somewhat inconsistent. Sources of variation include among others study design, age, ethnicity, and gender of the population under investigation. Studies that looked at the effects of the MD on site-specific cancers concluded that the decrease in tumor risk may be more pronounced for the distal colon as opposed to the proximal colon.",224332d4-279e-4e08-bb74-79d2a67d58f6
120,discussion31," However, results of meta-analyses support the adoption of a MD to decrease risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) irrespective of tumor site. Additionally, other well-established benefits of the MD eating pattern (diabetes prevention; improved cardiovascular health, cognitive, and bone health, etc.) support its adoption as a healthy dietary choice. Suggested new frontiers of investigation include the role of the MD pattern on epigenetic regulation of gene expression and changes in microbiome associated with initiation and progression of Colorectal cancer (CRC).  Author Contributions MD, OS, TD, and DR contributed to the conceptual development, organization, and review of the manuscript; MD and DR were responsible for systematic review of the literature, collecting and cataloging of published data, and writing of the manuscript; DR was responsible for the content of the manuscript.",b278a2c8-8669-41de-b502-6bd916ce6a59
