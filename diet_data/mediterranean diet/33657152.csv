Western Blot  The Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to assess the total protein concentration in AML12 WT and KO cells after they were lysed. Then, 10 µg of proteins were separated on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filter membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

Synthesis and Physicochemical Characterization of Squalene Loaded poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) Nanoparticles  To examine the synthesis and physicochemical characterization of the nanoparticles prepared using the single emulsion approach, the squalene encapsulation ability of poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) was characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Table 1). The maximum squalene loading in poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based nanoparticles was found when using 50 µL initial squalene (2.",7d3dc3f5-d08e-49cb-a8bd-60876b025c03
17,methods17,"05 M, ≥98%, liquid) volume that reached 8122 ± 735 µM of squalene loading. This represented 77.8 ± 5.1% encapsulation efficiency, and the highest ratio of squalene referred to poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) of the ones tested. The encapsulation efficiency reported in the literature for squalene loaded nanoparticles was variable depending on the nanoparticle type and the synthetic method ranging from 26 to 82% [45,46,47]. These nanoparticles were selected to carry out the experimental work. Nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (scanning electron microscopy (SEM)) to determine their morphology and size (Figure 1). poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs devoid of squalene were spherical in shape, in contrast to NPs loaded with squalene that showed a larger size an oval shape (Figure 1).",fedf6ff3-df20-4dce-9984-5238b52f13ac
18,methods18," Transmission electron microscopy (transmission electron microscopy (TEM)) analysis confirmed a general trend toward size increase when squalene was loaded in poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) (Figure 1). Particle size histograms determined from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed that the mean size of poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles increased from 90.5 ± 13.3 to 167.9 ± 31.3 when squalene was encapsulated (Figure 1). Then, it seems that squalene affects both the micelle shape and size during the emulsification process. This observation is in agreement with previous results where the presence of lipids such as cholesterol can increase the poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) size [48].",c7015620-146c-4e60-9860-801b3535a6b6
19,methods19," The hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticles in water at neutral pH, estimated by dynamic light scattering (dynamic light scattering (DLS)), was 259 ± 107 nm for squalene loaded poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs and their dispersion was higher than that of empty NPs (Table 2). The analysis on the particle size between transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) demonstrated the same trend, confirming the size enlargement when squalene is encapsulated. The nanoparticle mean diameters from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image-based measurements were smaller than the ones obtained from hydrodynamic size measurement. However, these differences can be explained by the technique differences—in transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the nanoparticles are dried, and the size should be smaller after shrinking [49,50,51,52]. The presence of squalene also had a clear impact on the zeta potential values. In this sense, the negative values (−46.",2645fcb1-cbbe-4dca-a1ca-3d93bf8af728

The negative charge of poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs without squalene could be attributed to the presence of ionized carboxyl groups in the acid terminated poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) (poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA)-COOH), whereas the less negative charge of poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based squalene nanoparticles might be due to the presence of squalene on the surface of the nanoparticles, as described previously for other nanoparticles [53].  3.2. Influence of Several poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs Concentrations on the Morphology of AMl12 Cell Line  After squalene extraction and GC/MS analysis, the squalene concentration loaded into poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles was determined to be 3.05 mM.",96b990c7-19ba-49a5-9dc5-221ed7b501c7
21,methods21," The influence of various concentrations of poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles was qualitatively examined by microscopy after 72 h of incubation with AML12 cells. Hence, four different concentrations were investigated.

The 150 µM poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs caused the cell to completely shrink (Figure 2A), but the shrinkage was mitigated by lowering the nanoparticle dosage (Figure 2B–D). Due to the observed morphological impact of the highest doses, the 30 µM of squalene loaded in the poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles was selected to carry out the subsequent studies on AML12 cells.  3.3.",3c1ecee0-2e76-49f9-9ff4-3172860d9082

As shown in Figure 4(A1), WT cells treated with squalene NPs exhibited a significant decrease in Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production compared with the poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) group. However, squalene NPs increased the formation of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in KO samples (Figure 4(A2)).",eacfd179-268c-4a56-bc7e-6b6439115915
24,methods24," The comparison of the control group and the poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) illustrates that poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles did not induce Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both cell lines. To peruse whether 30 µM of squalene loaded NPs could effectually represent protection against oxidative stress, we initially developed an in vitro model of oxidative insult. When WT and KO cells were incubated with 25 mM H2O2 for 3 h, a significant reduction in intracellular reactive oxygen species was detected in AML12 WT cells treated with squalene NPs (Figure 4(B1)), whereas in the KO cells, the increment was observed (Figure 4(B2)). These results suggest that there was not any squalene protection in cells lacking TXNDC5 in exposure to the oxidative agent.

The poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs did not produce notable alteration on the cell viability, according to the MTT assay, when compared to the control group. Squalene loaded poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs could significantly increase the viability of both cell lines (Figure 5A,B). Viability enhancement was calculated in the different H2O2 concentrations that were tested, and the results showed that the squalene delivered from poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles incremented, on average, the viability in the wild-type mouse hepatocyte cells and knockout by 16 and 21%, respectively (Figure 5C).  3.5.",5101030f-2f2a-4973-afd1-79654249089a
26,methods26," Effect of Squalene Protection on Oxidative Stress Response In Vitro by Gpx4 Induction  After treatment for 72 h with squalene-loaded poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) based NPs (30 µM), we examined the levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 in both cell lines. Specifically, we discovered that Gpx4, which is involved in the antioxidant defense to neutralize oxidative stress, significantly increased its mRNA level in the squalene-treated samples (Figure 6A,B). Compared with the control group (Figure 6C,D), mRNA levels of Gpx4 were significantly downregulated by the oxidative challenge (25 mM H2O2), irrespective of squalene supplementation. However, in squalene-treated samples, there was not any considerable reduction in mRNA levels of Gpx4 in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.  3.6.

The poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles without the squalene revealed no changes (Figure 7). After exposure to ER stress, both cell lines (i.e., AML12 wild-type and knockout) exhibited a fairly remarkable increase in the cell viability when using squalene-containing nanoparticles, i.e., at 18 nM cell viability reached values of 6.73% for WT (Figure 7A) and 6.55% for KO in average (Figure 7B), compared to the unexposed control.  3.7.

However, in TXNDC5-deficient cells, mRNA abundance of Atf6 and Ern1 was significantly up-regulated by squalene treatment; furthermore, there was a significant difference in Eif2ak3 expression (Figure 8B). When exposed to 12.5 nM of thapsigargin for 24 h to induce ER stress, for evaluating the function of squalene-poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs, wild-type cells exhibited a substantial attenuation in Ern1 transcription rate; whereas, Atf6 and Eif2ak3 presented no significant decrement in mRNA levels (Figure 8C).",56970d26-d864-4153-ba2e-fe0e1951e3b1
29,methods29," The results in TXNDC5 knockout cells indicated that the Eif2ak3 expression had a profound reduction in the presence of squalene in exposure to agents that cause ER stress, while no difference in Atf6 and Ern1 expression was observed between the squalene loaded in poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs and the poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (Figure 8D). These findings suggest that squalene plays an important role in maintaining the viability of mouse hepatocytes by repressing Ern1 and Eif2ak3 signaling in wild-type and knockout cells, respectively.  4. Discussion  The goals of this study were to vindicate the influence of squalene, the main ingredient of the unsaponifiable fraction in virgin olive oil, loaded into poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles on oxidative and ER stress in a mouse hepatic cell line. Furthermore, the dependence or independence on TXNDC5 putative molecular pathways involved in hepatic stress has been investigated.",4def4cec-db2d-45f2-90cb-67d82637b65e
30,methods30," In this context, poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA), as a naturally derived and biodegradable polymer, is being explored for its ability to transport compounds of therapeutic relevance. Squalene is a naturally occurring cholesterol precursor that forms stable colloidal phases in water [54], and itself is a carrier of many substances and, considering the biological action of squalene, the effect could be a sum of actions [55]. As a result, our findings revealed that squalene was effectively encapsulated in poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs, resulting in stable NPs. Overall, the synthesis of squalene/poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs using the single-emulsion solvent evaporation method is a simple preparation procedure, which could facilitate their successful clinical translation.",90bf4ccf-2251-4f16-9071-168c8892a831
31,methods31,"  Based on microscopic observations of poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs encapsulating fluorescent probes and/or the measurement of the probe’s intracellular levels, many investigations have indicated quick and efficient cellular uptake of poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs [56,57,58]. The assessment of squalene content in our study revealed that poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles have a great ability to transfer squalene as a nanocarrier in mouse hepatocytes (Figure 3). As described in different studies, poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles are effective nanocarriers for the encapsulation and delivery of various anti-cancer agents such as oleanolic (OA) and ursolic (UA) acids in three different cell lines, i.e.",5b22ff2f-1e37-4a1c-b321-9f0c736ea860
32,methods32,", HepG2 (human hepatoma cell line), Caco-2 (human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line) and Y-79 (human retinoblastoma cell line) [16]; also, for the encapsulation of several pharmaceuticals including haloperidol, estradiol, etc. [20]. For instance, the poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based curcumin NPs have displayed entrapment efficiency in the range of 77 to 85% [59].  Intracellular Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is necessary for regular cellular activities and physiological processes, but when its production exceeds the intrinsic antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress occurs, causing severe damage to cellular macromolecules [60]. Squalene’s antioxidant properties are intimately linked to the unique and stable triterpene structure that allows it to effectively scavenge harmful free radicals [61]. The protective effects of squalene versus oxidative destruction have been formerly documented in rodents [6,62,63,64,65].",acfde87d-1106-46f9-bc5b-f07f7a7f2d92
33,methods33," Squalene can protect murine macrophages [32], Chinese hamster pulmonary fibroblasts (V79 cells) [66], human monocytes [32] and mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) from hydrogen peroxide-induced damage in cell culture assays by directly scavenging Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner [34] and our finding in the present study reveal that squalene can reduce the Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction in mouse hepatic cells. Next, we investigated whether TXNDC5 deletion contributes to squalene protection against oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) influences ER homeostasis and protein folding directly or indirectly, causing ER stress and possibly cell death in the case of extreme ER stress [67,68]. TXNDC5 appears to be involved in the formation of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ER stress, according to growing data [69,70].",7913ab1e-23ee-4c8f-94e7-e3794316b950
34,methods34," Inhibiting TXNDC5 expression via knockdown has previously been shown to induce Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ER stress in pancreatic cancer cells [69]; however, increasing TXNDC5 expression in lipid endothelial cells effectively reduces Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and protects cells [70]. The present study demonstrates that, in AML12 cells, as reflected in Figure 4A, an inverse and statistically significant difference was found between Reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and TXNDC5 in exposure to squalene so that, in absence of TXNDC5, Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was increased, while the Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was decreased in WT samples. When cells were challenged to an oxidative stimulus (Figure 4B), a significant decrease of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the squalene treated group in WT cells was observed, being the opposite in TXNDC5-KO cells.",aca8eab5-d3d4-46aa-8ddb-89ddb9da8922
35,methods35," This finding reinforces previous research that found that oxidative stress-induced TXNDC5 was involved in proper protein folding via its disulfide isomerase activity [71]. Overall, these results evidence that squalene can alter Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in oxidative stress, in dependence of TXNDC5 (Figure 9). In the evaluation of the viability of cells in different concentrations of H2O2 based on the TXNDC5 elimination, in all concentrations that we tested, in the absence of squalene, TXNDC5 deletion significantly reduced the viability of mouse hepatocytes (Figure 5D). However, when the cells were treated with squalene, the viability of both cell lines was increased using 20 and 25 mM concentrations of H2O2 (Figure 5(D1,D2)).",b8871753-c104-4a92-9c0f-196206abf6a8
36,methods36," With these results in consideration, TXNDC5 can increase the squalene efficiency in AML12 cell viability and act as an oxidative stress-induced survival factor that regulates Reactive oxygen species (ROS)/ER stress signaling, allowing AML12 cells to remain viable under oxidative stress, but it is not the only factor, and squalene could bypass it.  Since lipid peroxide accumulation is harmful to cell viability, most mammalian cells repair lipid damage with the phospholipid peroxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), whose blockage results in ferroptosis [72,73,74]. Previous studies have shown that oxidative stress decreased GPX activities and increased MDA accumulation (a substantial product of lipid peroxidation) in plasma and in the liver of piglets [44,75]; whereas our current study results, as shown in Figure 6C,D, confirmed that H2O2-induced oxidative stress reduced the mRNA level of Gpx4 in WT and KO mouse hepatic cells.",881126fc-cba1-49a6-b20e-e9a720d76403
37,methods37," Squalene accumulation in cholesterol auxotrophic lymphomas inhibits oxidative cell death by Gpx4 induction [76]. Oral administration of squalene improved rats’ redox status after being exposed to cyclophosphamide-induced oxidative stress by boosting GPX activity in the heart, testis and urine bladder and normalize the alteration of Gpx4 in the heart and hemolysate of red blood cells [62,63]. Our results also evidence the induction of Gpx4 in the presence of squalene in WT and TXNDC5-deficient cells. When both kinds of cells were exposed to H2O2, squalene incubation rescued the decreased Gpx4 expression with independence of TXNDC5 (Figure 6). This mechanism could partly explain that TXNDC5-deficient mouse hepatocyte cells could survive against H2O2-induced oxidative stress by the therapeutic action of squalene (Figure 9).",bb914a3b-1651-4816-bcb8-2495189a2413
38,methods38,"  TXNDC5 is a thioredoxin with a protein disulfide isomerase-like domain that is expected to catalyze disulfide formation to facilitate protein folding or to control protein function in the face of endoplasmic reticulum stress [77]. When cells were exposed to thapsigargin that compels ER stress, WT and KO cell lines exhibited analogous cell viability (Figure 7A,B). Sullivan et al. found that TXNDC5 could protect endothelial cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis [37]. The major ER stress-induced pro-apoptotic mediators have so far been identified as DDIT3, JNK and cleaved caspase-12. As a downstream protein, DDIT3 is involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis and can be triggered by EIF2AK3, ERN1 and ATF6 [78]. ERN1 is a transmembrane protein that regulates its own expression and functions as a protein kinase and endoribonuclease [79,80].",ca6c38a9-c09f-4949-87ca-ceb98deb7431
39,methods39," ATF6, a type II transmembrane protein, is another ER stress sensor, up-regulating chaperones and ERAD pathway components [81], and EIF2AK3 is important for reducing workload by blocking mRNA translation, stopping additional synthesis and, consequently, protein folding under ER stress [82]. To identify the TXNDC5 mediators’ role in endoplasmic reticulum stress, we performed gene expression analysis on Atf6, Ern1 and Eif2ak3 in the presence of squalene loaded in poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) (Figure 8). In the context of ER stress-induced effects, Chawsheen et al. found that the knockdown of TXNDC5 in human lung cancer cells accelerates the unfolded proteins and induces ER stress that increases the expression of Eif2ak3, Ern1 and Atf6 [83].  Accordingly, our results demonstrated that the downregulation of TXNDC5 increased the mRNA level of ER stress markers in mouse hepatic cells (Supplementary Figure S2).",a129fc75-66b4-47eb-b8b4-94a87821110f
40,methods40," In the presence of induced ER stress, squalene decreased Ern1 expression in WT cells in comparison to KO (Figure 8C). However, the opposite result was observed regarding Eif2ak3 expression that decreased in TXNDC5 knockout cells, and no significant change was seen in Atf6 (Figure 8C,D). Multiple experiments showed that knockout of ATF6 prevented the upregulation of Txndc5 mRNA; TXNDC5 is located downstream of the ATF6 in cardiac, kidney fibroblasts and stelae cells [84,85,86]. Consistent with these results, we found that TXNDC5 may be posited downstream of the ATF6 and upstream of EIF2AK3 and ERN1 in hepatic cells. Based on this hypothesis, we suggest that TXNDC5 may regulate ER activity through distinct signaling pathways in stressful circumstances; moreover, squalene could reduce cell mortality by decreasing Ern1 or Eif2ak3 expression as ER stress markers in hepatic cells depending on TXNDC5.  5.",8497faf3-e25f-444d-8f87-fc4f0899e2f3
41,methods41," Conclusions  The current study shows that squalene was successfully encapsulated in poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs, yielding stable nanoparticles with rapid and efficient cellular uptake. Squalene-based poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs effectively reduced Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in normal mouse hepatocytes, whereas Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was increased in TXNDC5-deficient AML12 cells. The cell viability of WT and KO cells under oxidative stress conditions was increased in the presence of squalene by Gpx4 induction. Squalene also enhanced the cell viability of mouse hepatocytes in thapsigargin-induced ER stress by repressing Ern1 or Eif2ak3 expression in wild-type or knockout cells, respectively. Thus, TXNDC5 represented a crucial role in regulating ER activity through different signaling pathways in stressful circumstances.",9fc273cf-f732-4016-adbd-eec2946d49b4
42,methods42," Likewise, squalene-loaded poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA)-NPs protect mouse hepatocytes from oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress by variable mechanisms depending on TXNDC5 presence. While this study was successful, there were some limitations in the poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) encapsulation efficiency of squalene, which was variable in the amount of squalene in each batch of nanoparticle synthesized. Additionally, there was a limitation in poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA)-squalene NP cell treatment, so the cells underwent osmotic stress when exposed to high doses of poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA)-squalene NPs. Hence, high doses of squalene may not be useful in these experiments. ",4af162ae-e31d-45c4-b9b0-e3aedc943e90
