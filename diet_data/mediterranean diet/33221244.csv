0,methods0," We present this study according to the journal’s formatting requirements and the Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline for reporting cross-sectional studies [19].  2.1. Study Design, Setting and Participants  The Australian Bureau of Statistics (Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)) conducted the Australian Health Survey (Australian Health Survey (AHS)) in 2011–2013 that contained the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS)), the National Health Survey (National Health Survey (NHS)), and the National Health Measures Survey (National Health Measures Survey (NHMS)). Study participants who were in the National Health Survey (NHS) or National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS) and gave consent to the National Health Measures Survey (NHMS) provided urine and blood samples; the samples were then tested for a range of chronic disease biomarkers.",ea1adc91-5a51-430b-b136-8c7d5c4f92e1
1,methods1," We used data from the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS) and National Health Measures Survey (NHMS), with 9435 fully responding adults. For the present study, we selected participants who were adults (aged 18 years or over) with at least overweight (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2) and not pregnant or breast feeding at the time of the survey (n = 5055). Since a comprehensive description of the methodology used in this study has already been published [20], we present a brief summary below.  2.2. Ethics  The Australian Health Survey (AHS) was approved by all relevant ethics committee(s) and was conducted according to Australian law (Census and Statistics Act 1905) [21] and the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Also, a written informed consent was sought from study participants [20].  2.3. Data Sources/Measurement  The National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS) was conducted from May 2011 to June 2012 [20].",0b21e5fc-897c-4644-b2ec-e57a87c68908
2,methods2," Trained Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) interviewers used a Computer Assisted Personal Interview (Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI)) methodology to collect self-reported data. Dietary data was collected using the 24-h recall methodology. The interviewers used the Automated Multiple-Pass Method (Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM)) developed by the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture [22]. It was adapted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Food Standards Australia New Zealand to reflect the Australian food supply. The Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) has five phases: quick list, forgotten foods, time and occasion, detail cycle, and final probe that encourage participants to think about foods and beverages they have consumed in the previous 24 h from different perspectives. Interviewers also used food model booklets to further assist participants describe their consumption.",1529dbd5-55f1-4751-9d31-9fdbdd469174
3,methods3," For anthropometry data collection, participants were encouraged to remove shoes and heavy clothing before taking weight and height measurements. Interviewers used digital scales to measure weight (maximum 150 kg) and a stadiometer to measure height (maximum 210 cm). The National Health Measures Survey (NHMS) was conducted from March 2011 to September 2012. The biomedical data collection involved blood and urine samples collected at collection clinics or via home visits using standard procedures [20].  2.4. Variables  All survey questions are described in the Australian Health Survey (AHS) User Guide [23].  2.5. Dependent Variable  The Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) variable was created using chronic disease biomarkers (for diabetes, cholesterol, triglycerides, kidney disease, and liver enzymes), measured blood pressure, and self-reported long-term health conditions.",eff991f6-c1a7-4d78-a80e-dc2b666f9970
4,methods4," Specific criteria and thresholds were used to classify study participants in one of the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) categories (0–4) (Table S1). Study participants who did not meet at least one of the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) 1 to 4 criteria were classified into the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) 0 category. When participants fulfilled more than one of the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) 1 to 4 criterion, the highest score was used to classify their final Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) stage.  2.6. Independent Variable  We created our Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) variable according to one of the most common methods used to assess adherence to Mediterranean diet pattern [14,24]. The methodology used herein has been previously published in detail elsewhere [25].",4bebc595-f13a-4744-926c-ebc6c34c331c
5,methods5," Briefly, to create the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) variable, we first calculated sex-specific medians for each of the nine components of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) for the 5055 study participants. Second, we assigned a value of 0 or 1 to each observation i.e., for healthy components a consumption equal to or above the median got a value of 1 and otherwise 0 and for unhealthy components, a consumption below the median got a value of 1 otherwise 0. Lastly, the values of each component were summed to create final Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) scores which ranged from 0 to 9. The methodology used herein has been published in detail elsewhere [26]. In the present study, only dietary data from day one of the 24-h recalls was used.  2.7. Covariates  We considered the following range of demographic and behavioural covariates in our statistical analyses.",f74091c8-ccff-4d78-98cc-c849648c0f7d
6,methods6," Demographic variables included sex, age, country of birth, marital status, highest year of school (determined by asking participants “What is the highest year of primary or secondary school completed?”), Socio-Economic Indexes For Areas (Socio Economic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA)) (a measure of socio-economic advantage and disadvantage created from other variables on income, housing, and education according to the residential postcodes of participants) [27], and hours usually worked each week (determined by asking participants “How many hours usually do you work each week?”). Behavioural variables included whether exercise last week met 150 min recommended guidelines according to standard National Physical Activity Guidelines for Australian adults (determined by asking participants questions such as: “In the last week, how many times did you do any other more moderate physical activity that you have not already mentioned? (e.g.",eae113c6-42f6-43e6-87b8-470a2f5a08fc
7,methods7,", gentle swimming, social tennis, golf)” and “In the last week, how many times did you do any vigorous physical activity which made [you/him/her] breathe harder or puff and pant? (e.g., jogging, cycling, aerobics, competitive tennis)”); smoking status, (determined by asking participants questions such as: “Do you currently smoke?” and “Have you ever smoked regularly, that is, at least once a day?”), and dieting, (determined by asking participants if they were currently on any kind of diet to lose weight or for some other health related reason) [20].  2.8. Sample Size Considerations  Studies with the same sample size as ours (comparing groups of size 2019 and 3036) have 90% power to detect a difference in proportions from 0.50 in group 1 to 0.55 in group 2 and statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level.",4c850884-d406-41b6-8d68-21307a79dfdb
8,methods8," We conclude that our study is well powered to detect any clinically meaningful differences in Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) risk category associated with poor diet.  2.9. Bias  Out of the 12,366 dwellings in the actual sample, 9519 adequately or fully responded to the first interview of the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS), with an estimated response rate of 77%. As Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from objectively measured weight and height, with scales and stadiometers, selection of the overweight sample was error free.  2.10. Statistical Analysis  We presented the characteristics of study participants by Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) categories 0–1 vs. 2–4 as counts and percentages and tested for differences between these two groups using Chi-square tests.",39dfb753-4035-48d3-a94f-4ddd86f7f432
9,methods9," We used logistic regression to assess the association between low adherence to Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (scores 0–4) (unhealthy dietary pattern exposure) vs. high adherence to Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (scores 5–9) (healthy dietary pattern reference) associated with Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) 2–4 (dependent variable). We fitted five models to assess the association: unadjusted (Model 1), adjusted for Socio Economic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA), sex, age, country of birth, marital status, hours usually worked each week, and level of highest education (Model 2), adjusted for whether exercise last week met 150 min recommended guidelines and smoking status (Model 3), adjusted for dieting (Model 4), and adjusted for energy (Model 5).  2.11.",5659f6cb-11d8-40b4-85d5-55c1e3a8eccf
10,methods10," Sensitivity Analyses  We fitted models using Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) tertiles (Table S2) and quartiles (Table S3) to explore the association between the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)). We also repeated the main analysis using the mean of two dietary recalls using the data from participants who had intakes of both days (n = 3438) (Table S4). We further explored the association across age and Socio Economic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA) strata and tested for potential confounding. To further determine whether other potential confounders have influenced our result, we used Propensity Score Matching (Propensity Score Matching (PSM)) to minimize confounding due to selection bias [28].",6ac1ac11-22b1-49bb-a9c1-19627dd3232c
11,methods11," We used logistic regression to calculate the propensity scores, checked the balance of the scores across low adherence Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (scores 0–4) and high adherence Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (scores 5–9), examined the propensity scores graph, checked for covariate balance, and matched the data using the nearest neighbour 1:1 matching with a 0.1 caliper. The Propensity Score Matching (PSM) excluded observations out of the common support area (Figure S1). We repeated the main analysis on the matched dataset (n = 3364) (Table S5). We performed the analyses using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 [29] and ‘Pscore’ and ‘psmatch2′ in STATA 15 [30] to conduct the Propensity Score Matching (PSM).  3. Results  3.1. Descriptive characteristics  The study population included 5055 adults with at least overweight (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2) of whom 3036 (60.",5a690672-deff-471f-8d2a-87832cac1dce
12,methods12,"1%) were classified into the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) 2–4 group indicating clinically significant weight related complications (Table 1). The percentage distributions for Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (e.g., poor Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) score 0–4: 67.0% vs. 65.2%) and sex (e.g., male: 51.9% vs. 54.1%) were similar across the two Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) groups (Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) 0–1 vs. 2–4) but statistically significantly different for Socio Economic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA) (e.g., Socio Economic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA) most disadvantaged: 17.4% vs. 21.4%), country of birth (e.g., other countries: 13.4% vs. 15.6%), and marital status (e.g., married/de facto: 53.4% vs. 57.1%).  3.2.",9d2a9e5f-14da-4f95-87b8-ead81a7e570a
13,methods13," Main Results  There were no statistically significant associations between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) category in the unadjusted analysis in Model 1 or after adjustment for all other covariates in separate Models 2 to 5 (Table 2).  3.3. Sensitivity Analyses  We conducted sensitivity analyses to further explore the association between poor diet measured by the adherence to Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and weight related complications measured by Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)). After using tertiles (Table S2) and quartiles (Table S3) of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), there was a reverse association in unadjusted models but after controlling for the covariates the significance was lost. Also, the results were not changed after the main analyses were repeated using mean dietary intake of two days (Table S4).",f82a3325-a042-47ab-9000-df537159e7bf
14,methods14," Furthermore, the null association between low adherence Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) of 0–4 and Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) ≥2 remained unchanged after we repeated the analysis on three age strata (Table 3) and five Socio Economic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA) strata (Table 4). Furthermore, the null finding persisted even after we tested for associations in the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) dataset (n = 3364) (Table S5).  4. Discussion  To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively examine the association between unhealthy dietary pattern and weight related complications.",bc922efd-2985-4025-8cd9-a408bcf6ac54
15,methods15," In this nationally representative subsample of the Australian population with overweight and obesity, we found no evidence of an association between unhealthy dietary pattern (low adherence Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) and weight related complications (Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) ≥ 2) in the unadjusted analysis and after controlling for covariates. Moreover, this null finding persisted after sensitivity analyses with mean dietary intake of two 24 h dietary recalls, in stratified models by age and Socio Economic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA) categories, and after our application of the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) technique. Based on the results of our cross-sectional study, unhealthy dietary pattern was not found to be a useful indicator of weight related complications in the overweight Australian population.",439ec2de-592b-441e-ade8-9070f59d1f8a
16,methods16,"  Our null association is consistent with another cross-sectional study of the Australian Health Survey (AHS) data set which reported no association of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), using the same definition as ours, with the presence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease after controlling for covariates [31] and another study which showed inconclusive results for poor diet (defined by lower diet quality scores) across Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) stages [18]. In contrast, one study found that adequate fruit and vegetable intake (defined as “men >35 servings per week; women >25 servings per week”) was associated with a decreased risk of developing weight related complications (Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EObesity Surgery Score (OSS)) 2 or 3) [17].",7336f556-2eb1-419e-b636-66633a5cb2ea
17,methods17," Thus, the limited body of inconsistent evidence indicates that population-wide screening for unhealthy dietary patterns as a strategy for identifying risk of weight related complications in people with overweight and obesity is not yet warranted.  The null association reported herein was unexpected given that there is strong expert opinion favouring the Mediterranean diet pattern for better cardiovascular health outcomes [32,33] and evidence from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials showing small but significant reductions in blood pressure [34,35]. Furthermore, the Mediterranean diet pattern has been associated with healthy weight outcomes [14] and cardio-vascular benefit [36] in both the Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean regions.",f7cbfe0d-28b3-4d7d-bc39-df1a0cc3a0ce
18,methods18," In contrast, a recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials concluded that there is genuine uncertainty regarding the effect of the Mediterranean diet pattern on cardiovascular disease outcomes, as the quality of evidence is low to moderate [37]. Moreover, another systematic review reported the evidence on the Mediterranean diet intervention lacks robustness due to insignificant results for primary outcomes or as significant results were fragile (a small number of events needed to change the result from significant to non-significant) [38]. This conflicting evidence requires further examination and theoretical explanation.  Limitations  There are several plausible explanations for the apparent lack of consistent findings on unhealthy dietary pattern and having or developing weight related complications. First, several limitations in the accuracy and reliability of dietary assessment methods in research are generally well known [39,40].",1ce93680-9ebb-4a7b-90fb-b4503c6e4712
19,methods19," For instance, although 24-h recall provides detailed intake data, it is a subjective method of assessing diet prone to recall bias [41,42]. Furthermore, the 24-h recall method is unable to capture the day to day or seasonal variation in food intake and reflects the average usual intake of a group [41,43]. Under-reporting is another common source of error in nutrition surveys, as individuals could change or mistakenly misrepresent their diet pattern [44]. More importantly, studies have shown that participants with overweight or obesity could omit some food groups during diet assessment, especially for total energy intake and/or unhealthy foods [20,45,46]. It is estimated in the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS) that low energy reporting was more common among those with obesity compared to normal weight individuals (males: 34% vs. 10%; females 37% vs. 16%) [20].",ed67a6a3-bb48-4c62-8cf9-057aa408738f
20,methods20," Second, the effects of unhealthy diet on weight related complications may be too small to detect, especially in populations with excess weight. For instance, one randomized controlled trial showed a very small and clinically meaningless (–1.1 mm Hg) decrease in systolic blood pressure and no change in diastolic blood pressure after six months of a Mediterranean diet intervention compared with usual diet controls [47]. Third, the null association may have been confounded by reverse causation. It is plausible to hypothesize that some individuals may have changed their dietary pattern or reporting thereof after a new diagnosis or medical event at the time of the survey. For instance, cohort studies have shown that higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was protective of cardiovascular diseases [48,49] while a cross-sectional study, similar to our finding, reported no association [31].",163d939e-012b-4bcb-bf1a-59bc2a029e6f
21,methods21," Furthermore, a study has shown that individuals may change their diet after having affected well-being (e.g., due to increase in weight) or learning a health problem [50]. Finally, the Australian Health Survey (AHS) was conducted using a multi-stage sampling and experienced some non-response. We did not use the weights provided by the Australian Health Survey (AHS), so our sample and results may vary slightly from what would have been obtained with a completely random sample from the Australian population. But it is hard to see how this could have led to any systematic bias in the analyses. This potential source of bias is most likely to occur in cross-sectional studies such as ours as dietary pattern and weight related complications were measured at one point in time.  5.",fcb39fe5-98d3-43c1-889b-ddb3f2d4a846
22,methods22," Conclusions  We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that unhealthy dietary pattern (defined by low adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern), was associated with an increased likelihood of having weight related complications among individuals with overweight and obesity in Australia. Although the null association reported herein is consistent with a growing body of conflicting evidence on the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, future studies should seek to improve the accuracy and frequency of dietary assessments to reduce several plausible sources of bias.
