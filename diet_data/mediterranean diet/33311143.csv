0,introduction0," Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) such as gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction are common, yet little is known about how modifying dietary intake impacts PD symptoms. The aim of this study in individuals with PD was to determine whether a Mediterranean diet intervention is feasible and affects GI function, intestinal permeability and fecal microbial communities. ",66a1f4a0-a30e-4b21-9f7b-97cbcb2dba99
1,methods0," A single-arm, 5-week Mediterranean diet intervention study was conducted in eight people with PD. Daily and weekly questionnaires were administered to determine changes in GI symptoms. Urine and stool samples were collected at baseline and after 5 weeks to assess intestinal permeability and fecal microbial communities. Additionally, live-in partners of the participants with PD were matched as controls (n = 8) for baseline urine and stool samples.   Participants  Study participants were recruited at the University of Florida Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases in Gainesville, FL. This study was approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board-01 and was carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.",10e45a05-128d-4c38-ad75-f97edf1a1817
2,methods1," To compare differences in intestinal permeability and microbiota at baseline and after the diet intervention, live-in partners of the participants with PD were recruited to provide urine and stool samples during the baseline period (control group). Participant inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Methods and Results in Supplementary Material.  Study Design and Questionnaires  Participants with PD were enrolled in a 2-week baseline period followed by a 5-week diet intervention period from April to September 2019. Participants were instructed to maintain their usual diet and level of physical activity throughout the baseline period and completed questionnaires. Daily questionnaires assessed stool frequency (i.e., number of weekly bowel movements), stool form using the Bristol Stool Scale (21) and adverse events. The weekly questionnaire assessed GI symptoms using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)) (22).",7cd1c381-94de-4313-8785-4891a1b48199
3,methods2," During the baseline period, participants with PD completed 3, 24-h dietary recalls (2 weekday and 1 weekend) using the Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool, version 2018 (23). On the last day of the baseline period, participants with PD and their live-in partners attended their first study visit (visit 1). Study staff measured height (seca 213, Hamburg, Germany), weight (seca 813, Hamburg, Germany) and Mediterranean diet adherence using the 14-item Mediterranean diet adherence screener (Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS)) where a score ≥10 indicates “good adherence” (24). Measurements completed at visit 1 were repeated at the end of the 5-week intervention period for the participants with PD (visit 2).",d135871a-bb6f-43b9-9079-dcf874149a7d

Participants were asked to take their usual medications and evaluated during the “ON” period of their medication, when possible. PD medications did not change during the study protocol. Participants in the control group were evaluated by the neurologist to rule out signs of neurological disease or condition.  Mediterranean Diet Intervention  At the first study visit, study dietitians provided diet education and instructed participants with PD to increase their adherence to a Mediterranean diet for 5-weeks. Participants were followed weekly by study dietitians (4 times) via telephone to support adherence during the intervention (i.e.",326c57e5-c191-406e-94be-32965fcdc040

6,methods5," For usual drinkers, the main source of alcohol should be wine. Participants were instructed to limit consumption of cream, butter/margarine, red and processed meats, carbonated and sugared beverages, commercial bakery products and desserts, French fries or potato chips.  Sample Collection  Stool Samples  Stool samples were collected during the second week of the baseline period (PD and control groups) and at week 5 of the intervention period (PD group only) using a commode specimen collection system (Biomedical Polymers, Inc.) for fecal microbiota analyses. Participants were instructed to portion ~1 g of stool sample into tubes containing 3 mm glass beads and 7 ml RNAlater Stabilization Solution (Invitrogen) to preserve the sample at room temperature. Samples were shipped overnight by participants to the study site and stored at −80°C until processing.",2b3b532a-d0e7-4f6a-8cd7-cb3da988c40f
7,methods6,"  Urine Samples and Permeability Testing  Urine samples were collected at visit 1 (PD and control groups) and visit 2 (PD group only) as described by van Wijck et al. using orally administered sugars as markers of intestinal permeability (28). In brief, after an 8-h fast, participants arrived at the study site, emptied their bladder, and drank a beverage containing five sugars. After drinking the study beverage, participants provided a fasted 5-h urine collection at the study site, followed by an unfasted 19-h collection at home to complete a full 24-h urine collection. Urine samples were kept on ice packs in coolers. Participants returned the 19-h urine collection to the study site the following day. Urine collections from each timepoint (0–5 h and 5–24 h) were weighed and stored at −80°C until analysis.  The 5-sugar beverage contained 1.0 g sucrose (Now Real Food, IL, USA), 0.5 g L-rhamnose (Yundao Production, China), 1.0 g lactulose (Wockhardt, IL, USA), 1.",6c2d50c9-f16e-4b4b-bcdd-4fa778d76f23

However, when analyzing urinary concentrations of the sugars at the completion of the study it was determined that L-rhamnose was mispackaged and actually contained neotame (Methods and Results in Supplementary Material). Neotame is a non-nutritive, U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved food additive (29). Subsequently, erythritol was used for the ratio for upper GI permeability because it is of similar molecular weight to L-rhamnose (122.1 vs. 164.2 g/mol, respectively). Urinary recovery and permeability ratios were calculated as previously described (30).",9f355bf3-2fb2-4f10-9d08-013bd32d2022

10,methods9, The QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with an added 3-min bead beating step after the addition of the first lysis buffer (31). Methods for 16S RNA gene sequencing were conducted as previously described (32). DNA products were purified using Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads (Omega BioTek) according to the manufacturer's protocol and were quantified using a Quanti-iT dsDNA assay kit (Invitrogen). Equimolar amounts of DNA were pooled and submitted to an on-campus core facility for sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform (250 bp paired-end reads). Sequences with a length of <200 nucleotides and single stranded reads were removed from the analysis. Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2) tool (version 2019.7; open source software) (33) pipeline was used to trim and quality filter sequences.,274fbd23-dd46-4b00-893a-255c55108b26
11,methods10," Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were determined using Deblur (34) and clustered into de novo operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 95% and 98% similarity level using VSEARCH (35). Rarefaction curves to assess species richness and comparability of the samples were also generated through these pipelines. Chimeras were removed, and taxonomy was assigned to OTUs using a classifier built with Scikitlearn (36) and verified against the Greengenes 16S rRNA gene database (Version 13.8) (37). A phylogenetic tree for diversity analyses was generated with the FastTree pipeline (38).

If normality failed, the non-parametric equivalent was used (i.e., Wilcoxon Signed Rank test). Statistical analyses were carried out using Sigma Plot Version 14.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Data are presented as means ± standard error (standard error (SEM)). A P < 0.05 was determined to be statistically significant.  Microbiota Analyses  Chao1 rarefaction diversity, a measure of α-diversity, and UniFrac distance, a measure of β diversity, were calculated at baseline between groups and week 5 of the diet intervention for the PD group.

13,methods12," Differences in proportions at baseline (PD and control group) and changes after diet intervention (PD group only) showing the presence/absence of specific OTUs with 95% similarity were calculated using the z-test (z score >1.96 or <-1.96 indicated significance of P < 0.05). Heat maps were generated to include all OTUs that reached significance. For qPCR assays, genome equivalents were used as the unit of comparison in an attempt to correct for differences in genome size and copy numbers of 16S rRNA genes. Paired t-tests between proportions of total DNA for fecal taxa were compared between PD and their matched control at baseline and week 5 of the diet intervention (PD group only) with a P < 0.05 determined to be statistically significant. If normality failed, the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used. Due to the exploratory nature of our study and the small sample size, P-values were not corrected for multiple comparisons.

Parkinson's disease Mediterranean diet constipation microbiota intestinal permeability National Institute of Food and Agriculture 10.13039/100005825 Hatch project FLA-FOS-005636 ==== Body pmcIntroduction  Parkinson's disease (PD), is characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein and loss of dopaminergic neurons resulting in motor and non-motor manifestations (1). Non-motor symptoms of PD often occur several years before onset of other symptoms including olfactory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction (2). Constipation, a common GI symptom prevalent in up to 80% of individuals with PD, often leads to reduced quality of life and increased disease burden (3–5).",a83f8fce-5efc-4ebd-8e6f-36fd2749ca91
16,results2," GI dysfunctions, including maintenance of the intestinal barrier and microbial diversity, have been an emerging area of interest in neurodegenerative research, yet little is known about how modifying dietary intake may impact these outcomes in individuals with PD.  The intestinal barrier is a dynamic system containing of epithelial cells, mucus secreting goblets cells and cytokine secreting immune cells. Digestive enzymes, as well as microbial metabolites, contribute to absorption of necessary nutrients, electrolytes, and water while barrier fortification ensures that potentially harmful pathogens and toxins remain within the luminal compartment (6). Both, intestinal permeability as well as local and systemic inflammation have been shown to be altered in PD. Two studies yielding conflicting results have investigated intestinal permeability in PD patients compared to matched controls using an orally administered sugar probe (7, 8).",b51063b2-8b3f-4417-85b3-8e47539f759c
17,results3," Other studies have found alterations in tight junction proteins (e.g., occludin and zonulin) and increased intestinal inflammation (e.g., fecal calprotectin, lactoferrin) which can lead to increased intestinal permeability (9–11). The results of these pilot studies warrant further investigation to not only confirm their findings, but also establish if diet interventions can promote beneficial microbes and improve barrier function in people with PD.  The Mediterranean diet includes (1) variety of fruits, vegetables, legumes, unrefined cereals, (2) healthy dietary fats from olive oil, avocadoes, nuts and seeds, (3) moderate amounts of fish, poultry, eggs and dairy, and (4) limited intake from red meats or sweets (12). Fiber is an under-consumed component of the Western diet enriched in the Mediterranean diet that helps maintain regular stool frequency, thereby reducing symptoms of constipation.",8464c25c-bc61-4d31-a507-76d6531fee71
18,results4," Prebiotic fibers found naturally in fruits and vegetables and added to many foods are selectively fermented by intestinal bacteria to produce short chain fatty acids (e.g., acetate, butyrate, propionate) important for maintaining intestinal barrier function and reducing intestinal inflammation (13, 14). Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been associated with increased: (i) microbial richness (15), (ii) microbes thought to be beneficial (15–17), and (iii) increased short chain fatty acids (15, 17, 18). Recent studies have shown distinct alterations in intestinal bacteria and bacterial products with PD, such as decreased Faecalibacterium (butyrate producer), Prevotellaceae, and overall reduced short chain fatty acids compared to healthy controls (19, 20). To date, there have been limited therapeutic diet interventions aimed to specifically improve GI dysfunction in PD patients.",7f3f0dc7-c8e2-4845-8aec-bd10c40cb3ad
19,results5,"  Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether adhering to a Mediterranean diet is feasible and induces beneficial changes in GI function (e.g., stool frequency and consistency and GI symptoms), intestinal permeability and fecal microbial communities in individuals with PD.    Participant Characteristics  A total of 16 participants (n = 8 PD group; n = 8 control group) agreed to participate in the study. All participants with PD completed the 2-week baseline and 5-week intervention period (Supplementary Figure 4). All participants in the control group provided urine and stool samples at baseline only. The majority of participants with PD were white males with a H&Y stage 2 on dopaminergic medication (Table 1).

Mediterranean Diet Adherence and Dietary Intake  Mediterranean diet adherence scores significantly increased after the 5-week diet intervention in the PD group (4.4 ± 0.6 vs. 11.9 ± 0.7; P < 0.01), indicating good adherence. All participants with PD (n = 8) completed at least 3 out of 4 scheduled telephone calls with study dietitians. Average dietary intake was compared before and after the Mediterranean diet intervention (Supplementary Table 4). Carbohydrate density (% total kcal), dietary fiber, total fat, total fat density, monounsaturated fat (including oleic acid) and polyunsaturated fat (including linoleic acid) significantly increased after the Mediterranean diet while cholesterol intake significantly decreased.

OTUs that were identified to be more prevalent in the PD group included: Christensenellaceae, Butyricimonas, Oscllospira, and Dorea. Interestingly, multiple OTUs for Blautia were also shown to be more prevalent in the PD group at baseline.

28,discussion0," The primary aim of this study was to test the feasibility of a Mediterranean diet intervention and its impact on GI function, intestinal permeability and fecal microbial communities in PD patients. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet was shown to be feasible in PD patients as demonstrated by an increase in Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) scores (≥10 indicating “good adherence”) at the end of the 5-week diet intervention. Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) scores have been validated against 3-day food records as an accurate and reliable assessment of Mediterranean diet adherence (24). Dietary changes likely were re-enforced by participant's compliance with weekly telephone follow ups as telephone interactions have previously been shown to promote dietary behavior change (39). We also observed unintended loss of body weight after the intervention.",6aafc826-8114-445e-a895-302db36e01e4
29,discussion1," It is possible weight loss was attributed to decreased total energy intake, however we did not observe this when measuring energy intake by 24-h dietary recall. Our dietary assessment might have lacked accuracy as under- and/or overestimate of food intake has been reported (40). The Mediterranean diet is associated with promotion of healthy weight loss in overweight and obese individuals (41), which was also seen in our study. In PD, individuals with lower BMI are associated with higher UPDRS scores and increased risk of malnutrition (42, 43). Therefore, weight status should be considered before making dietary changes and future interventions should characterize diet effects on body composition and nutritional status in this population.",375712a7-fdbf-4295-ada6-3ede9677a1a0
30,discussion2,"  Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) constipation syndrome and indigestion scores significantly decreased from slight discomfort to no discomfort after the diet intervention in participants with PD suggesting the Mediterranean diet may be an effective intervention for reducing GI symptoms in this population. This may be attributed to the increased intake of dietary fiber observed in this study as this is in line with recommendations for treatment of functional constipation (44). Limited studies have evaluated the effectiveness of diet interventions on constipation symptoms in PD. Recently, one study demonstrated increased stool frequency and softer stool form as well as reduction in laxative usage using synbiotic fermented milk containing 7.8 g of fiber in people with PD (45). Usage of fiber and probiotic supplements in this population have also been documented in smaller studies (46).",abf11f0e-8d58-4c3d-a623-6e80e7dc0ab7
31,discussion3," Optimal management of constipation symptoms in PD has yet to be determined and findings from this study could support the usage of Mediterranean diet recommendations in this population.  Urinary excretion ratios of markers of intestinal permeability did not differ at baseline between groups, nor changed after the diet intervention. This is in contrast with earlier findings which demonstrated PD is associated with increased lactulose/mannitol ratio (small intestine permeability) (47). Further, a previous study has documented increased 24-h sucralose excretion in PD compared to healthy controls (8). While 24-h sucralose excretion was not different at baseline in this study, we did observe lower excretion of the 5–24-h sucralose at baseline in the PD group compared to controls and a significant increase after the 5-week Mediterranean diet intervention. Single sugar excretion for 0–5-h lactulose and erythritol were also increased after the diet intervention.",a47afe59-e04c-418d-9817-eaefa31c45ce
32,discussion4," It's possible these changes were observed due to faster intestinal transit and increased exposure to absorptive surface area of the enterocytes. Differences observed between studies may be attributed to small sample sizes (n < 20) and methodological differences for administering and measuring sugar probes as permeability markers. Newer methods used in this study have been validated by van Wilk et al. to use site-specific timing (small intestine [0–5 h], colonic [5–24 h], and whole gut [0–24 h]), lower dosage of lactulose (1 g vs. 7.5 g) and sugars of smaller molecular weight (erythritol) to normalize for transit time and kidney function (28).  Though microbiota diversity was not different at baseline between groups or after the diet intervention, differences in proportions of genera were observed between groups at baseline and after the 5-week Mediterranean diet intervention. Specifically, proportions for Roseburia decreased and Bilophila was increased at baseline. Roseburia spp.",e4d2b0e7-7766-4a2f-b101-ab352fc19ea2
33,discussion5," are butyrate-producing members of Firmicutes and have been shown to be reduced in inflammatory bowel diseases (48, 49) and PD in a recent meta-analysis (50). Interestingly, Roseburia spp. may be involved in immune system regulation (51) and are considered primary degraders of dietary β-mannans (i.e., found in foods such as nuts, tomatoes, and legumes) that respond rapidly to supplementation in vivo (52). This may explain increases in proportion of Roseburia observed after the Mediterranean diet intervention. Bilophila is sulfite-reducing member of Proteobacteria that can produce hydrogen sulfide which may impair colonocyte function and butyrate oxidation (53). Other studies have also shown this genus to be increased in PD, correlated with H&Y staging and involved in regulation mucin-degraders like Akkermansia municiphila (54, 55).",6725a326-914c-4633-9494-dce45d10c4be
34,discussion6," Further, taxonomic differences in Roseburia, Bilophila, Akkermansia, Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, Dorea, Blautia, and others have been correlated with constipation symptoms in PD (56). This may explain changes in prevalence observed in these taxa after the Mediterranean diet intervention, but these observations should be confirmed in future studies.  The L-rhamnose mispackaging was an unforeseen limitation of the study as it was originally intended to control for the ratio of upper GI permeability. However, our use of erythritol also met the requirements as it is rapidly absorbed by the small intestine, contains a similar molecular weight and less likely to be fermented by bacteria (57). Our study was limited by the lack of a control group during the intervention period and small sample size which reduced our power to observe differences in intestinal permeability and microbiota.",ed20b2e2-65eb-4f11-810e-af3a8a9479a5
35,discussion7," Furthermore, because this was a small feasibility study to generate future hypotheses, results, including weight loss after the Mediterranean diet intervention, should be interpreted with caution.  Conclusion  In this preliminary study, we demonstrated that short-term adherence to a Mediterranean diet is feasible and may be effective in improving constipation symptoms and modulating microbiota but not intestinal permeability in people with PD. Future studies should be conducted to confirm the effect of a Mediterranean diet intervention on constipation symptoms, gut microbiota and intestinal permeability in a larger cohort.
