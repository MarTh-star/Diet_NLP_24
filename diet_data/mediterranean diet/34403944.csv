0,methods0," In the Rotterdam Study, participants were followed for iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) since 1991, with intervals of approximately 5 years. A total of 170 participants developed iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) during follow-up. Participants with iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) were matched with healthy controls on age and sex in a case:control ratio of 1:5. The associations between food frequency questionnaire-derived diet adherences (baseline) and iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) were analyzed using multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses. The associations between the diet adherences and intraocular pressure (intraocular pressure (IOP); a risk factor for open angle glaucoma (OAG)) were assessed using multivariable linear regression analyses.   Ethics statement  The Rotterdam Study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Erasmus MC (registration number MEC 02.",7d945ef3-fff1-4db2-985a-b83b88e5f9fb

The Rotterdam Study has been entered into the Netherlands National Trial Register (NTR; www.trialregister.nl) and into the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/) under shared catalog number NTR6831. All participants provided written informed consent following the declaration of Helsinki to participate in the study and to have their information obtained from their treating physicians.  Study population  Participants were derived from three independent cohorts from the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study (RS-I, RS-II, RS-III), designed to assess determinants of age-related diseases in the middle-aged and elderly population (45+ years).",87e3c169-cdcf-4bc6-971f-63f9be1c3d89
2,methods2," Enrollment for the ophthalmic part started in 1991; after the baseline visit, participants were invited for follow-up visits with intervals of approximately 5 years [21]. Of the 8679 participants with ophthalmic and iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) examinations, 6941 had baseline data on dietary intake. Of those, 170 participants developed iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) during follow-up. Since age has a strong positive association with iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) risk [22] and strong inverse association with dietary intake [23, 24], and dietary intake is different for females compared to males [25], we chose a nested matched case–control design for the analyses. We matched cases and controls on age (with a maximum difference of 3 years) and sex in a 1:5 ratio, and sampled without replacement. The final dataset consisted of 170 cases and 850 controls.",314982ca-5a5f-4aa9-b8d0-273f939ce1e4
3,methods3,"  Ophthalmic assessment  The eye examinations included Goldmann applanation tonometry (Haag-Streit AG, Bern, Switzerland) and visual field testing (Humphrey Field Analyzer; HFA II 740; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) was defined as glaucomatous visual field loss in at least one eye with reproducibility of the defect, independent of intraocular pressure (IOP) [26]. Other possible causes of visual field loss were excluded. iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) cases had an open anterior chamber angle and no history or signs of secondary glaucoma [26]. For intraocular pressure (IOP), three measurements were taken from each eye, of which the median value was recorded. For iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) cases, we used intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements of the affected eye. If both eyes were affected or unaffected, a random eye was selected.",a79f9514-c3c6-4f3a-ad7a-3e7145b16791
4,methods4,"  Dietary data and diet scoring  Dietary intake was assessed at baseline using food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) as described in detail elsewhere [27]. Briefly, for the first two cohorts, a 170-item FFQ was applied as two-stage approach. First, participants indicated which foods they consumed at least twice a month in the preceding year. Second, a trained dietician used this list to identify how often and in which amounts the foods were consumed. For the third cohort, dietary intake data was collected using an extended self-administered 389-item FFQ. Both FFQs were previously validated and showed reasonable to good estimates of nutrient intake [28–30]. All food items were assessed based on the frequency of consumption (in times per month or per week), the number of servings per day (expressed in standardized household measures) as well as on the preparation methods. Participants with unreliable reported dietary intake (energy intake < 500 kcal/day or > 5000 kcal/day) were excluded.",a79dbf5c-4910-4be5-9640-4e745fd63eeb
5,methods5," The Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet contains recommendations regarding 15 food components, including 10 food components considered as brain-healthy (i.e., green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil, and wine) and five food components considered as unhealthy (i.e., red meat, butter and stick margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets, and fried/fast food) [11]. Scoring was performed based on non-adherence (0), moderate adherence (0.5) and good adherence (1). In the case of olive oil, it was considered good adherence when olive oil was used as the primary cooking fat (> 50%) and non-adherence when used less than or equal to 50%. The final Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet score ranged from 0 to 15.",62dcd0fd-9447-4fbc-a796-e71821e1dfea
6,methods6," The Mediterranean diet contains recommendations regarding 11 food components: vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, fish, full-fat dairy products, potatoes, olive oil, poultry, meat, and alcoholic beverages [12]. Adherence to each food component was scored from 0 to 5, with 5 being the greatest adherence. The final Mediterranean diet score ranged from 0 to 55. The Dutch dietary guidelines (2015) include recommendations for 14 food components: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, fish, tea, dairy products, whole grains of total grains, unsaturated fats and oils of total fats, red and processed meat, sugar-containing beverages, alcohol, and salt [19, 20]. Participants were scored as non-adherent (0) or adherent (1), resulting in a final Dutch dietary guidelines score ranging from 0 to 14. Diet adherence was expressed in percentage, calculated by dividing the adherence score by the maximum adherence score theoretically possible and multiplying by 100.

Covariates  Education level was assessed with questionnaires and categorized into: primary education (with or without a partially completed higher education), lower education (lower vocational or lower secondary education), intermediate education (intermediate vocational or general secondary education), or higher education (higher vocational education or university). Smoking status was obtained using questionnaires and participants were classified as non-smoker, former smoker, or current smoker. Weight and height were measured at the research center.

8,methods8," Energy intake was obtained from the previously described FFQs. For physical activity two different questionnaires were used: a validated adapted version of the Zutphen Physical Activity Questionnaire [31] (RS-I and RS-II) and the LASA Physical Activity Questionnaire (RS-III) [32]. Data were recalculated into metabolic equivalent of task (metabolic equivalent of task (MET))-hours per week. The total activity scores from these questionnaires are not one on one comparable, and we, therefore, used a cohort specific z-standardized score.  Statistical analyses  Differences in baseline characteristics were evaluated using chi-squared tests and independent-samples t tests. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the baseline characteristics of participants in the different quartiles of the diet adherences.",5346121e-7bac-4a55-a31a-dec255394923
9,methods9," To determine the association between adherence to the different diets and iopen angle glaucoma (OAG), we performed multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Additionally, we modelled the diet adherences in quartiles with the first quartile (Q1) as reference category to test for evidence of linear trends. The median value for each category as continuous variables was used in separate conditional logistic regression models. The final models included Body mass index (BMI), energy intake, physical activity, and follow-up time (all as continuous variables).

27,discussion1,"  To our knowledge, we are the first to report an association between the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and iopen angle glaucoma (OAG). However, previous studies investigated the association between its specific components and iopen angle glaucoma (OAG). We highlight the components that showed to be protective for iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) in the present study. Greater intake of green leafy vegetables was associated with a 20 to 30% risk reduction of open angle glaucoma (OAG) [8]. Also, compared to consuming ≤ 1 serving of green collards and kale per month, consuming > 1 serving per week (OR [95% CI]: 0.43 [0.21 to 0.85]) or ≥ 1 serving per month (OR [95% CI]: 0.31 [0.11 to 0.91]) reduced glaucoma risk [9, 10].",4135ed8b-c47b-4bef-924b-fcdacdf67d3d
28,discussion2," Also in our analyses, an inverse association was observed between green leafy vegetables and iopen angle glaucoma (OAG), most likely caused by the presence of high concentrations of nitrate [33], vitamin A, B2, B9, C and E [34], lutein, and zeaxanthin [35].  Higher fruit intake has previously been associated with lower open angle glaucoma (OAG) risk [9, 36, 37], but the effect of berries specifically has never been determined. Berries are a good dietary source of bioactive compounds with antioxidant properties, such as vitamins and minerals [38, 39]. They are rich in manganese, vitamin C, and vitamin B9 [40]. Fibers, known to decrease incidence of several types of diseases, are also highly present in berries [41]. Moreover, berries are a remarkably good source of polyunsaturated fats, which are necessary for building cell membranes and covering nerves as well as for proper blood clotting, muscle movement, and protection against inflammation [42].",a94d692c-eaaa-442f-9896-e3ad0c33eb64
29,discussion3," Additionally, berries have a substantial amount of omega-6 linoleic acid, omega-9 oleic acid, and omega-3 linolenic acid, which are linked to an array of health benefits [43, 44]. Lastly, they are rich in polyphenols [45], which harbor anti-proliferative, anti-diabetic, anticancer, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral abilities, along with high antioxidant capacity [45–53]. The protective effect of berries in the present study may be explained by the fact that oxidative stress, inflammation, and ocular hypertension play a role in the pathophysiology of open angle glaucoma (OAG) [54–56]. The present study confirmed the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering potential of berries.  Fatty fish is rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, known for their anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, antithrombotic, hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory functions [57]. Inconclusive findings have been reported for the association between fish consumption and open angle glaucoma (OAG). Renard et al.",0d1c2e75-e8d7-45ab-aab8-75f1af338a07
30,discussion4," performed a matched case–control study with 334 open angle glaucoma (OAG) cases and reported a higher OR with lower fatty fish consumption (OR [95% CI]: 2.14 [1.10 to 4.17]) [58]. Kinouchi et al. observed no significant association between fish consumption and open angle glaucoma (OAG) [59], but their number of cases (N = 42) was limited. Although the significant association between fish intake and iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) observed in the present study confirms some of the earlier findings, the effect of fish intake on iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) remains unclear.  No significant association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet or the Dutch dietary guidelines and open angle glaucoma (OAG) or intraocular pressure (IOP) was observed. One previous study reported moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet in open angle glaucoma (OAG) patients; however, they could not address causality since exposure was not measured before onset of disease [60].",90fa89cc-a661-49ea-87f0-435e2d1fe99d
31,discussion5," Another prospective cohort study reported a lower risk of glaucoma in participants adhering to a Mediterranean lifestyle, but no significant association was found with the Mediterranean diet in the single component analysis [61]. The Dutch dietary guidelines have previously not been assessed with regard to iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) risk. Although the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and the other diets share a similar profile, the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet has a separate category for green leafy vegetables and berries. Both have been suggested to have neuroprotective effects [62].",7338186f-a348-4d1f-b883-a94a8143c9ba
32,discussion6," Separating green leafy vegetables from the other vegetables and assessing berries specifically instead of fruit as a whole, may explain why we did find a significant association between the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and iopen angle glaucoma (OAG), but not for the other two diets.  Given that individual caloric intake is relatively stable over time, changes in dietary habits are generally characterized by substitution effects, where high consumption of one component is associated with lower intake of other components [63]. This makes inferences about individual components particularly challenging. Food patterns pre-empt potential dietary confounding by other aspects of the diet, increase the ability to assess stronger effects due to the cumulative effects of many features of the diet, and allow assessment of the interaction among synergistic components.",1e16b084-9cce-4a26-8a3e-f5932ba1ee7e
33,discussion7," Even though observed associations with dietary patterns could be due to a single component rather than the overall dietary pattern, this can be tackled by performing food component analyses assessing the effect of single components for the overall association, as performed in the present study.  Strengths of this study include the prospective population-based design, which allowed for repeated eye examinations and thus prospectively ascertaining iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) cases (according to a well-established open angle glaucoma (OAG) definition [26]), and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. Moreover, we used validated FFQs to collect dietary data. Using dietary information from baseline assessments, we limited selection bias, since all included participants were free of open angle glaucoma (OAG) at this visit. Moreover, the FFQs were administered to cases and controls under similar conditions.",2c831d92-22f7-4077-9f99-7db61955ad02
34,discussion8," Furthermore, we assessed the association between the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) over cumulative follow-up periods to provide insight into possible reversed causality. The persistence of the association over time implies that reverse causality is unlikely. Data on several possible confounders were available, although residual confounding cannot completely be ruled out. Given that our cases and controls were matched on age and sex, it is very unlikely that our findings were affected by the association of age and sex with dietary intake.  Limitations were also present. Using the prospective population-based design and including only participants with incident open angle glaucoma (OAG), we limited the number of cases. Thus, there was insufficient statistical power for more detailed sub-group analyses (e.g., smokers vs. non-smokers).",aec51815-5ef5-4bc0-a29d-148b36117a02
35,discussion9," Using the FFQ, we relied on the participants’ memory for collecting information for as far back as 1 year. Also, participants are likely to under- or over-report certain foods. Since dietary data are collected before onset of disease, this would most likely lead to non-differential misclassification: participants that develop iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) over time are expected to under- and over-report food items in a similar manner as participants that remain free of iopen angle glaucoma (OAG). Nevertheless, since 50% of all glaucoma is familial [64], it is possible that iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) cases already adjusted their dietary patterns to anticipate their “expected” increased open angle glaucoma (OAG) risk. Nonetheless, this differential misclassification would result in a bias towards the null hypothesis, underestimating the true effect.",b288eb95-6680-42cb-bc7b-eb7ef0d49138
36,discussion10," Additionally, the data on dietary patterns that were collected at baseline do not per definition reflect long term intake as participants may change dietary habits over time. As dietary recommendations are not used as intervention for iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) it is unlikely that participants who developed iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) over time were more susceptible to dietary pattern changes than participants who did not develop iopen angle glaucoma (OAG). As a result, we do not expect that such non-differential misclassification would affect the associations present in our study. Lastly, treatment of chronic illnesses like hypertension and diabetes mellitus could have led to dietary changes during follow-up. However, since none of these illnesses are clearly associated with open angle glaucoma (OAG) [65, 66], this would probably result in non-differential misclassification, with limited effects on the associations found.",3460260a-c30f-49ba-b40e-80095d1c3d8b
37,discussion11,"  Conclusion  In conclusion, we found an association between greater adherence to the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and lower risk of iopen angle glaucoma (OAG). The Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet was not associated with intraocular pressure (IOP), suggesting that its potential protective effect on iopen angle glaucoma (OAG) is more likely via preserving retinal ganglion cells than through lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). Neither the Mediterranean diet nor the Dutch dietary guidelines were significantly associated with iopen angle glaucoma (OAG). Although the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet appears to be promising for maintaining healthy eyes, these findings require confirmation.",07706ad1-e12f-4372-b7af-d1d17f070413
