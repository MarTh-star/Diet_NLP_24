0,introduction0,"Cancers of the esophagus (sixth place) and stomach (third place) were amongst the most common causes of cancer-related death in the world in 2012 [1]. Two histologic types of esophageal cancer can be distinguished, namely esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)) [2]. Based on anatomic location, gastric cancers are subdivided into gastric cardia adenocarcinomas (gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA)) and gastric non-cardia adenocarcinomas (gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA)) [3]. Different etiologies have been suggested for these subtypes [2, 3]. In the past decades, incidence rates of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) have been rising in many European countries and the United States (US) [4, 5].",e524d05c-f8df-47e5-bed1-dc45a84bf116
1,introduction1,"  The traditional Mediterranean diet (MD) is characterized by a high consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and other plant foods, with olive oil as the principal source of fat. Foods from animal origin are consumed in low amounts in the MD, whereas alcohol intake is moderate [6–8]. The relation between a priori defined MD adherence and the incidence of esophageal and/or gastric cancer (subtypes) has been the topic of a limited number of studies [9–13]. In these studies, higher MD adherence has been associated with reduced risks of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA), and total gastric cancer (GC), but results were not always significant and sometimes inconsistent, primarily with respect to the gastric cancer subtypes [9–13].",a3cde970-7e6d-46c4-8f96-9a0e868a3d42
2,introduction2,"  Information bias due to reversed causation is a major concern when investigating relations between dietary factors and gastrointestinal cancer risk, because preclinical disease symptoms may cause patients with gastrointestinal tumors to alter their dietary habits already before clinical diagnosis. Another concern is recall bias, which could particularly be a problem in case–control studies. For these reasons, the effects of dietary factors on gastrointestinal cancers should be investigated prospectively, if possible. So far, associations between MD adherence and risks of esophageal and/or gastric cancer subtypes have been prospectively investigated in only two cohort studies [10, 11]. Therefore, more prospective evidence on this topic is desired.",20bc5bb3-bef7-4d0e-9f05-1a8ad43b5d75
3,introduction3,"  This study prospectively investigated the association of MD adherence with the risk of esophageal and gastric cancer subtypes (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA)) in the Netherlands Cohort Study (Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS)). We assessed MD adherence using various a priori defined MD scores, with and without alcohol, and examined associations for men and women separately. ",3f444d0f-c300-412a-b117-8139a4454cde
4,methods0,"Study population and cancer follow-up The Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) is a Dutch population-based cohort study, which has been described in detail previously [14–17]. In summary, the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) comprises 58279 men and 62573 women, aged 55–69 years, from 204 Dutch municipalities, who completed a self-administered questionnaire on diet and other cancer risk factors at baseline in September 1986. A case-cohort design was used to allow for efficient processing and analysis of the data. Therefore, a subcohort (N = 5000) was randomly sampled immediately after baseline to estimate the number of person-years at risk. Cases were obtained from the total cohort. Vital status information for subcohort members was acquired biennially using municipal population registries [14, 17, 18]. Approval for the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) was obtained from the institutional review boards of Maastricht University and the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research.",e8a8bef6-b914-48a3-81d3-2e5c6f098705
5,methods1," All cohort members agreed to participate by filling out the questionnaire.  Follow-up for cancer incidence was carried out annually by record linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the Dutch Pathology Registry (Pathology Registry (PALGA)) [15]. The Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) cohort was followed-up for 20.3 years until December 31st 2006. To be eligible for inclusion in the present study, esophageal and gastric cancer cases had to be incident and microscopically confirmed with known tumor histology and topography. Based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition, esophageal and gastric cancers were classified into esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) (C15, histology codes: 8050–8076), esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) (C15, histology codes: 8140, 8141, 8190–8231, 8260–8263, 8310, 8430, 8480–8490, 8560 and 8570–8572), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) (C16.0), and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) (C16.1–C16.9).",d4d277a4-46af-4ffa-93d6-1367ff3e2e9a
6,methods2," Subjects were excluded if they had prevalent cancer at baseline (except any type of skin cancer) and/or incomplete or inconsistent data on diet, alcohol, or MD adherence. In total, 143 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), 224 esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), 218 gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and 642 gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) cases and 4084 subcohort members could be included in the analyses (Fig. 1).   Fig. 1 Flow diagram of the number of Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) participants, who are eligible for inclusion in the analyses (case-cohort design). N number of subjects, MD Mediterranean diet, Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) Netherlands Cohort Study     Exposure assessment A self-administered, 150-item, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) was utilized to assess the participant’s habitual diet during the year preceding baseline.",01568d14-c6fa-4696-8fb3-0986cd9856f5
7,methods3," Validity and reproducibility of this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) have been described previously [16, 19]. Mean daily nutrient intakes were calculated using the Dutch food composition table of the year 1986 [20].  Mediterranean diet adherence MD adherence was measured using two variants of the traditional Mediterranean diet score (tMED) created by Trichopoulou et al., namely the alternate Mediterranean diet score (aMED) and the modified Mediterranean diet score (mMED) [21–25]. Differences in daily energy intakes were taken into account in the calculation of the MD scores by standardizing daily food intakes to 2000 (women) and 2500 (men) kilocalories [21, 25]. aMED assesses relative MD adherence based on the mean daily intakes of nine dietary components [24, 25]. Each component is scored by 0 or 1 points with the maximum score of 9 representing the highest level of MD adherence.",058bf382-c13b-4d15-a79a-e54e9d00d9b5
8,methods4," Subjects receive 1 point for intakes at or above the sex-specific median of vegetables (excluding potatoes), legumes, fruits, nuts, whole grains, fish, and the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids (MUFA:SFA ratio). The intake of red and processed meats is scored inversely. In addition, 1 point is assigned to a moderate alcohol intake [5–25 grams per day (g/day) for both sexes] [24, 25]. mMED is calculated in a similar way as aMED, but includes slightly different dietary components [23]. In mMED, intakes of fruits and nuts are grouped together, and total cereal and meat intake is scored. In addition, 1 point is obtained for a dairy intake below the sex-specific median. To improve the usage of mMED in non-Mediterranean populations, the fatty acid quality is measured by the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA + polyunsaturated fatty acids) to SFA. Finally, a moderate alcohol intake is defined differently for men (10–50 g/day) and women (5–25 g/day) [23].",65b16624-a662-451d-828d-d1c70201e448
9,methods5," (Heavy) alcohol consumption has been associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and probably GC [26]. Therefore, MD adherence was also assessed using aMED and mMED variants without alcohol (aMEDr and mMEDr, respectively), which had maximum scores of 8 points.  Statistical analyses All analyses were performed separately for men and women, unless otherwise specified. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the associations of MD adherence with incidence of esophageal and gastric cancer subtypes were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models with follow-up duration as time variable. Person-years at risk for subcohort members were calculated from baseline until the diagnosis of esophageal or gastric cancer, death, emigration, loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up, whichever came first.",3d8f62d3-4bea-4bf5-8bec-7fc20f326c10
10,methods6," Standard errors were estimated using the Huber–White sandwich estimator to account for the increased variance because of subcohort sampling [27]. To verify that all variables met the proportional hazards assumption, scaled Schoenfeld residuals tests and –ln(–ln) survival plots were used [28]. A time-varying covariate was included in the model when a potential confounder violated the proportional hazards assumption and inclusion of a time-varying covariate altered the HR of the MD score.  MD scores were included as categorical [low: 0–3, middle: 4–5, high: 6–8(9)] and continuous (per two-point increment) terms in age-adjusted and fully adjusted analyses [23, 25]. Tests for trends were performed by assigning sex-specific median values among subcohort members to the MD score categories and fitting these as continuous terms in the Cox regression models.",eb6360ec-47f4-4874-b3b5-d7747c97a4d5
11,methods7," To correct for potential confounding, the following set of literature-selected variables was included in fully adjusted Cox models: age at baseline, sex (except for sex-specific models), cigarette smoking status, cigarette smoking frequency, cigarette smoking duration, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), total daily energy intake, alcohol consumption (except for models containing original MD scores including alcohol), highest level of education, non-occupational physical activity, and family history of esophageal cancer (for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)) or gastric cancer (for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA)).  Akaike’s Information Criterion (Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC)) was used to compare the performances of models containing aMEDr and mMEDr [29]. Furthermore, it was evaluated if inclusion of alcohol in the MD scores affected the model fits.",f86eb24f-9464-4388-8b79-c08737938ebe
12,methods8," Considering that (heavy) alcohol consumption has been associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and probably GC, MD scores without alcohol are prioritized in the results section of this article and subsequent analyses were only performed using aMEDr [26]. Moreover, we prefer the use of aMEDr to assess MD adherence, because aMEDr-containing models had similar or better performances than mMEDr-containing models in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS), both in the present and earlier analyses [30, 31].  The relative importance of the individual aMEDr components was investigated in two ways. First, all aMEDr components were entered simultaneously as dichotomous variables into fully adjusted Cox models. Second, HRs per two-point increment were estimated upon alternate removal of each aMEDr component from the sum score, one at a time, using the method described by Trichopoulou et al. [32].",c36877a9-f3a9-4d26-ab2b-b2011136cded
13,methods9," In addition, analyses stratified by cigarette smoking status, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), and educational level were performed. The statistical significance of possible differences across strata was tested by including interaction terms between aMEDr and the potential effect modifiers. Finally, sensitivity analyses were performed in which the first 2 years of follow-up were excluded. Men and women were combined in the stratified and sensitivity analyses to increase the power. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 15 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). Reported p values are two-sided and p values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. ",c61bd6db-fe8b-4f7d-bfaa-dd8d7b62c8bf

Concerning potential confounding factors, cases were older (except for male esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cases) and less often never smokers (except for female esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cases) than subcohort members.

In accordance with the cohort evidence, an Italian case–control study also observed a significant inverse association between a priori defined MD adherence and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk [9]. Case–control studies focusing on gastric cancer risk found higher MD adherence (a priori defined) to be associated with significantly reduced risks of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA), and total GC [12, 13]. Finally, adherence to an a posteriori defined MD pattern was inversely associated with total GC risk in a Spanish case–control study [33].",a29029ea-2bb8-4aa1-a7dc-835793f6b0d3
30,discussion3," Subtype-specific analyses showed that the inverse association was only statistically significant for gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA). Combining male and female participants in the present study, HRs (95% CI) per two-point increment in aMEDr were 0.77 (0.61–0.98) for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), 1.14 (0.94–1.37) for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), 0.86 (0.71–1.04) for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and 0.83 (0.73–0.93) for gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA).  For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), associations with aMEDr significantly differed between male and female Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) participants. Prior studies by Bosetti et al. [9] and Li et al. [11] did not observe a significant interaction between sex and MD adherence for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk. However, the inverse association in the latter study also seemed to be restricted to men [11].",02b575e0-5b64-4223-b83b-5da08a338e98
31,discussion4," Residual confounding by smoking behavior could potentially have caused the inverse association between aMEDr and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk that we observed in men. Tobacco smoking is strongly associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) [2, 34]. In our study, subjects in the highest aMEDr category were less likely to be current smokers. Since male participants were more likely to smoke than female participants, the effect of residual confounding by smoking behavior would be larger in men. This could potentially explain why we only observed an inverse association between aMEDr and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk in men.",67a71ace-1a0a-41aa-b4de-56d44d31671c
32,discussion5," However, additional subgroup analyses for smoking status restricted to men showed that the inverse association between aMEDr and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk was strongest in men who had never smoked (data not shown), making it less likely that the observed differences between men and women in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) were solely due to residual confounding by smoking behavior. Therefore, potential male–female differences in the association of MD adherence with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk deserve attention in future studies. For esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA), and total GC, there was no evidence of heterogeneity between the sexes in neither the present study nor the literature [10–13].",a0bc68e2-4830-4e49-9042-3cd4b9cd4814

Similarly, Li et al. [11] reported that aMED was only significantly inversely associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) risk in the lowest education category (pinteraction = 0.02). However, there was no evidence of effect modification by educational level in the study by Praud et al. [12]. Although the interaction between aMEDr and educational level that we observed might be a chance finding due to the large number of tests performed, it should be investigated in future studies.",bdd1ed79-2c0a-45e3-bb6b-d3feac9cc2d4
34,discussion7,"  In their Third Expert Report, the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research suggested that high intakes of vegetables and fruits, and low intakes of processed meat and grilled (broiled) or barbecued (charbroiled) meat and fish might be associated with reduced risks of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), and/or GC [26]. This is in correspondence with our observations that high intakes of vegetables, fruits and nuts, and a low intake of red and processed meats (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) only) particularly contributed to the inverse associations with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) risks in men in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS).",efc5e3b3-3518-4b2d-9597-a284fac88849
35,discussion8," In women, nuts, whole grains, fish, and the MUFA:SFA ratio were important aMEDr components contributing to the non-significant inverse associations observed for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) risk. Inverse associations (not all significant) between esophageal and/or gastric cancer subtypes and intakes of nuts (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA)), vegetables (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)), and fruits (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)) were also documented in previous Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) analyses [35, 36]. In addition, high intakes of red (non-significant) and processed meats were associated with an increased esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk in men [37].",c276782b-8bc0-4fb5-9212-7620a463aa21
36,discussion9," Although the above-mentioned aMEDr components were important contributors to the inverse associations that we observed in the present analysis, none of the individual components seemed to be the sole driver. This supports our pattern-based approach, which accounts for synergistic and antagonistic interactions between dietary components, and solves collinearity and confounding issues associated with the evaluation of individual components. Moreover, weak effects of single dietary components may only emerge when combined in dietary patterns [22, 38, 39].  Different etiologies have been suggested for the subtypes of esophageal and gastric cancer based on differences in risk factors and incidence trends [2, 3, 34, 40]. This stresses the importance of considering esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) as separate outcomes as we did in this study.",8fd915a4-9bff-4ae3-a01c-053584adce19
37,discussion10," esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) were clearly differently associated with MD adherence in our analysis. While MD adherence was significantly inversely associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk in men, no association was observed with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) risk. In contrast to the esophageal cancer subtypes, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) seemed to have roughly comparable associations with MD adherence.  MD adherence might reduce cancer risk by decreasing oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species-induced DNA damage and inflammation [39, 41]. The MD is rich in antioxidants (e.g., vitamins and polyphenols) from plant foods and olive oil, and has been associated with higher total antioxidant capacity and lower levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [26, 39, 41, 42]. Moreover, polyphenols (e.g.",21885932-13b7-4edf-a3d9-469b6ad463d7
38,discussion11,", flavonoids) may reduce inflammation and MD adherence has been inversely associated with inflammatory biomarker concentrations [24, 43]. Finally, dietary fiber possibly acts as a nitrite scavenger, counteracting the carcinogenic effects of N-nitroso compounds [39, 44]. Low meat intake may also contribute to the cancer-protective effects of the MD. Nitrates and nitrites in processed meat can form N-nitroso compounds in the stomach. Besides, heme iron in red meat also stimulates the endogenous formation of N-nitroso compounds and causes oxidative stress and DNA damage. Finally, carcinogenic heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are formed during high-temperature cooking of meat [26].  The use of data from a large prospective cohort with a long duration of follow-up enabled us to perform subtype- and sex-specific analyses.",71e99d6c-bade-4cef-8b23-b0e3ecf6e730
39,discussion12," However, case numbers for the individual subtypes were low, necessitating us to combine men and women in the stratified and sensitivity analyses to increase the statistical power. Another strength of our study was the availability of high-quality dietary data. The Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS)-food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was validated using 9-day dietary records completed over three different seasons, showing an adequate performance [16]. Furthermore, a reproducibility study demonstrated that the single baseline measurement of this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) performed relatively well in ranking subjects according to their nutrient intake for over at least 5 years [19]. Nonetheless, changes in dietary habits and potential confounders during follow-up might still have attenuated the observed associations. Instead of using self-reporting based methods (e.g.",3a40828c-1421-45b5-9f8b-a231b4f95907
40,discussion13,", food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s and dietary records), dietary intake could be assessed by the measurement of biomarker concentrations in blood. However, there are currently no biomarkers available that assess adherence to all the aspects of the MD. Furthermore, biomarker levels in blood are also influenced by, e.g., absorption and excretion rates and reflect only short-term dietary intake.  Despite the fact that we adjusted for a large number of potential confounders, residual confounding by unmeasured factors may still exist. For example, we did not obtain data regarding Helicobacter pylori infection, which might have confounded our results in particular for gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA). Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility of errors in the outcome measurements. However, it was reported that the histology and topography information from the Netherlands Cancer Registry, which we used to define the tumor subtypes, is of high accuracy [45].",8d814edb-31f0-43e3-9aba-4c960ba34087
41,discussion14," Reversed causation due to the presence of preclinical disease symptoms in cases is another concern, particularly when investigating relations between dietary factors and gastrointestinal cancers, as we discussed previously [46]. Prospective cohort studies are less sensitive to this type of bias than case–control designs and we obtained similar results when excluding the first 2 years of follow-up.  Data on the reliability of a priori scores used in the assessment of MD adherence are limited [47]. The reliability of ten indexes measuring MD adherence, including mMED and rMED, has been evaluated by assessing correlations with a hidden common factor (obtained by factor analysis) understood as “MD adherence” [48]. Both mMED and rMED were amongst the four indexes that showed high correlations with the “MD adherence” factor (mMED: 0.83, rMED: 0.80) [48]. Regarding the validity of the MD scores used, subjects with higher MD score values in our study consumed, as expected, more plant foods (e.",d22b2829-e069-4dc4-8416-a44039d6d4e8
42,discussion15,"g., vegetables, legumes, fruits, and nuts) and less foods from animal origin (e.g., meat and dairy products). A similar pattern was previously observed for tMED [22]. However, the validity of tMED and its variants has mainly been established by showing inverse associations with various adverse health outcomes including all-cause mortality and risks of and mortality from cardiovascular diseases and cancer (e.g., [22, 23, 25, 49, 50]). Several studies have compared associations between various index-based dietary patterns, including tMED (variants), and cancer risk. A review published in 2018 showed that 3 out of 4 studies investigating the association of tMED (variants) with postmenopausal estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer risk observed a significant inverse relation. However, associations were inconsistent for other dietary pattern scores [e.g.",bc59bbf1-282c-4ff4-a845-dd949f926650
43,discussion16,", Dietary Inflammatory Index (Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)), Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)) and Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHealthy Eating Index (HEI))] [51]. Considering prostate cancer risk, tMED (variants) and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) showed relatively consistent associations across studies, whereas the evidence was inconsistent and/or insufficient for the other indexes [52]. Furthermore, healthier diets according to tMED (variants), Healthy Eating Index (HEI)/AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) have all been associated with lower risks of colorectal cancer [53]. More studies evaluating associations of various index-based dietary patterns with cancer risk are required to identify the preferred dietary pattern(s) in the perspective of cancer prevention. A final limitation of our study was the population-dependent assignment of scores in the assessment of MD adherence, which we have elaborately discussed previously [46].",edb4b53c-3695-450f-b7b9-46bf48f9d86d
44,discussion17,"  In conclusion, high MD adherence was associated with reduced risks of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS). However, the inverse association with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk seemed to be restricted to men. So far, results for esophageal cancer generally were consistent with high MD adherence being associated with a reduced risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but not esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Findings concerning gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) were more diverse, but, generally, inverse associations (not always significant) were observed for at least one of the subtypes. The potential differences in associations between men and women, particularly for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), require further attention.",eb4a2e27-df36-49cb-b523-4dff78c61125
