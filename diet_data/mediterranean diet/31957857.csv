0,introduction0,"Impaired energy metabolism is one of the cornerstones of heart failure pathophysiology (Rosca and Hoppel, 2013). Normally, 60–90% of energy is generated through fatty acid oxidation (fatty acid oxidation (FAO)) ; however, in the early stages of heart failure, a shift from fatty acid oxidation toward glucose utilization is observed and is a mechanism of metabolic adaptation (Ventura-Clapier et al., 2011). Compared to healthy patients, heart failure patients exhibit decreased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) (Dávila-Román et al., 2002), which correlates with cardiac hypertrophy and reduced ejection fraction . During the progression of heart failure, overall cardiac oxidative metabolism decreases, resulting in energy starvation (Sabbah, 2020). One of the risk factors that lead to disturbances in energy metabolism and further progression of cardiovascular diseases is unhealthy dietary patterns.",de330756-f62d-4b6f-9efa-61ad062c949a
1,introduction1," For instance, high intake of fat, red meat and processed food, as in Western diet, is shown to damage myocardial oxidative capacity, leading to impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism . Moreover, dietary choices determine the composition of intestinal microbiota, which further unambiguously affects the host metabolism . It has been shown that chronic heart failure is characterized by substantial alterations in gut microbiome composition and reduced microbial variety . Previous studies suggest a link between the human gut microbiome and the homeostasis of energy metabolism, however, a clear causal relationship between them remains elusive.",2bb682db-9d7f-4c0d-941d-a8193cb8824d
2,introduction2,"  In 2011, in a targeted metabolomics study, trimethylamine N-oxide (Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)) was identified as a metabolite, which is both microbiota- and diet-derived, and associated with the incidence of adverse cardiovascular outcomes . Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) is produced in organisms by gut microbiota during the metabolism of common food constituents, such as carnitine, choline and betaine; this process first leads to the production of trimethylamine (trimethylamine (TMA)), which is subsequently oxidized by the host liver enzyme group called flavin-containing monooxygenases . High intake of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) and its precursor has been shown to promote atherosclerosis and exacerbate cardiovascular risks (Wang et al., 2011; Koeth et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2018).",2c17eb92-9170-4557-9c7e-55fef1e136c6
3,introduction3," A positive correlation between the circulating levels of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) and the severity of metabolic syndrome has been observed , and elevated Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) plasma levels were observed in patients with diabetes . Moreover, in heart failure patients, increased Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations correlate with heart failure severity, as shown by NYHA class (Tang et al., 2014, 2015; Trøseid et al., 2015) and heart failure-associated mortality .",e1500857-2381-4d93-b2d2-a2720406a9a7
4,introduction4," Although extensive studies of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) in various patient populations clearly demonstrate that Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) can serve as a biomarker, it remains uncertain whether Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) is directly involved in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic diseases (Nowiński and Ufnal, 2018).  Diet supplementation with Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) or its precursors has been shown to exacerbate cardiac dilation, leading to reduced ejection fraction and increased cardiac fibrosis, in an experimental model of heart failure . In addition, a reduction of circulating Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels by 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol or iodomethylcholine resulted in attenuated cardiac remodeling after aortic banding .",9654ce77-dddb-4998-b6df-b5cfd7a48bdf
5,introduction5," On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet, which is focused on regular consumption of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)-rich fish and seafoods , is inversely correlated with fatal coronary heart disease  and is proposed to be a strategy for preventing and reducing the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (Tørris et al., 2014; Widmer et al., 2015; Estruch et al., 2018). Moreover, it was recently shown that chronic treatment with low-dose Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) was associated with preserved cardiac hemodynamic parameters in Spontaneously Hypertensive rats and Spontaneously Hypertensive Heart Failure rats (Huc et al., 2018; Gawrys-Kopczynska et al., 2020). Such controversial results raise the question of whether increased availability of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) plays detrimental or protective roles in the progression of cardiovascular diseases.",25483842-92a3-4659-81e7-0c77e8ac06fd
6,introduction6,"  It has been shown that both acute and chronic Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) treatment can cause disruptions in energy metabolism in the heart by impairing pyruvate and fatty acid metabolism (Makrecka-Kuka et al., 2017). However, there is no evidence that Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)-induced metabolic alterations result in impaired cardiac functionality. It could be hypothesized that long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration could exert preconditioning-like effects, thus improving cardiovascular outcomes after stress conditions, such as hypoxia, pressure overload and altered energy substrate availability. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration in an experimental rat model of monocrotaline-induced right ventricle heart failure.",4eca83fa-4104-4f65-9dad-0994e6e61960
7,introduction7," To mimic the chronic increase in Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) in plasma and tissues, as observed in cases of regular consumption of seafood, Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) pretreatment for 10 weeks prior to monocrotaline injection was chosen. The effects of the administration of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) on indicators of heart failure severity (cardiac functional parameters, heart failure and hypertrophy-related gene and protein expression) and cardiac mitochondrial energy metabolism were studied.

Then, a single subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline (monocrotaline (MCT)) (60 mg/kg) was administered to induce right ventricular dysfunction, and treatment with Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) was continued (experimental groups: Control; Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O); monocrotaline (MCT); Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)+monocrotaline (MCT)). After 4 weeks, right ventricle functionality was assessed by echocardiography, mitochondrial function and heart failure-related gene and protein expression was determined.",08005218-a260-4e78-9653-114bc25676a4
9,methods1,"  Experimental Animals Wistar rats (n = 40) weighing 280–380 grams (6–8 weeks old) were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Centre, University of Tartu (Tartu, Estonia) and housed under standard conditions (21–23°C, 12-h light/dark cycle, relative humidity 45–65%) for 2 weeks prior to the start of the experiment. The animals were fed a standard R70 diet (Lantmännen, Stockholm, Sweden) with unlimited access to food and drinking water. All the experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines reported in the EU Directive 2010/63/EU and in accordance with local laws and policies, and all of the procedures were approved by the Latvian Animal Protection Ethical Committee of the Food and Veterinary Service, Riga, Latvia (Food and Veterinary Service Ethical approval Nr. 105). These studies are reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines .",5e539205-1797-4570-8452-637408ea8ce4
10,methods2," Our previous experiments, in which right ventricular functionality was assessed, indicated that due to interindividual variability, 8–10 animals per group are necessary to obtain significant results; therefore, n = 10 per group was chosen. The data from previous experiments in which mitochondrial energy metabolism was studied were subjected to statistical power analysis, and the calculations indicated that the mitochondrial respiration assay requires at least n = 5 or 6 per group to produce significant results with a power >0.95.  Experimental Design The schematic representation of the study design is shown in Figure 1. The experimental animals were randomly separated into four groups: control (n = 10), Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) (n = 10), monocrotaline (MCT) (monocrotaline) (n = 10) and Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)+monocrotaline (MCT) (n = 10).",99fd4780-fe81-476b-af36-42e4c0051b62
11,methods3," One animal in the control group and 2 animals in the other groups died during the experiment due to reasons not related to the experimental protocol and treatment. The samples from these rats were excluded from further analysis; therefore, the final animal count was nine rats in the control group and eight rats in the other groups. The animals in the Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) group and Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)+monocrotaline (MCT) group received Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) (Alfa Aeser, Kandel, Germany) at a dose of 120 mg/kg in their drinking water daily for 10 weeks. To induce pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular remodeling and dysfunction, a single subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline (monocrotaline (MCT)) (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) at a dose of 60 mg/kg was administered to the animals in the monocrotaline (MCT) and Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)+monocrotaline (MCT) groups.",9a802739-e669-4c0b-87ac-5838c7ac35dd
12,methods4," Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) treatment was continued in both groups that previously received Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) until the end of the experiment. The rats were weighed twice a week to monitor their general health condition. Since the time from monocrotaline (MCT) injection to right ventricular failure onset differs markedly , a 4-week time point after the administration of monocrotaline (MCT) was chosen for the echocardiographic assessment of right ventricle functionality based on our pilot experiments in this model. In addition, invasive direct right ventricular pressure measurement was performed. After the assessment of cardiac functionality, the animals were sacrificed, and cardiac tissue and plasma samples were immediately frozen and stored at −80°C for further analysis. In addition, a mitochondrial functionality study was performed using permeabilized cardiac fibers of the right ventricle.",fd61a051-7c8d-4456-a11b-741708f728f0
13,methods5,"  Figure 1 Schematic representation of the study design.  Echocardiography Assessment and Direct Right Ventricle Blood Pressure Measurement The rats were anesthetized using 5% isoflurane dissolved in 100% oxygen. After the onset of anesthesia, the concentration of isoflurane was decreased to 2.5%, the experimental animals were placed in a decubitus position, and the chest and upper part of the abdomen were shaved. The animals were connected to a Philips iE33 ultrasonograph (Philips Healthcare, Andover, USA) to record ECG from the II lead. Then, the rat was placed on the left side, and a four-chamber view was recorded from the apical point of view using a Philips (Philips Healthcare, Andover, USA) S12-4 sector array transducer. Right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic area (RV-EDA) and RV end-systolic area (RV-ESA) were recorded. ECG was used to determine the exact time of RV systole and diastole.",a023f4a3-fe23-4ffd-9681-7bd745bd0d07
14,methods6," Furthermore, RV-EDA and RV-ESA were used to calculate RV fractional area change (RV fractional area change (RVFAC)). The rat was again placed in a decubitus position, and functional parameters of the left ventricle were recorded at the papillary muscle level using a Philips (Philips Healthcare, Andover, USA) linear L15-7io transducer.  After the echocardiographic assessment of ventricular anatomy and functioning, invasive direct right ventricular pressure measurement was performed. The anesthetized rat was intubated using a 16-G intravenous catheter and mechanically ventilated with 2% isoflurane dissolved in 100% oxygen at a tidal volume of 1.5 ml/100 g. The abdominal cavity was opened, and the diaphragm was incised to expose the pleural cavity. The ribs on both sides of the chest were cut to access the heart. An 18-G needle was connected to a pressure transducer (AD Instruments, Sidney, Australia) and inserted into the cavity of the right ventricle through the apex of the heart.",1473fad4-5da8-4948-91a4-a11069438518
15,methods7," The right ventricular pressure was measured until a stable pressure reading was obtained.  Measurement of Organ Mass To calculate the organ-to-body weight indexes, the heart and lungs were excised and weighed. Then, the right ventricle (excluding the septum) was separated from the heart and weighed.  Measurements of Plasma Biochemical Parameters To obtain plasma, the blood samples were centrifuged at 1,000 g and 4° for 10 min and then stored at −80°C until further analysis. The levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol in plasma were measured using commercially available kits from Instrumentation Laboratory (Milan, Italy). The level of free fatty acids (NEFA) was measured using a commercially available kit from Wako Chemicals (Neuss, Germany).

Briefly, obtained tissues were homogenized with water in OMNI Bead Ruptor 24 (Camlab, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at a w/v ratio of 1:10. The obtained homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were collected and stored at −80°C until further analysis.  Sample preparation was performed by deproteinization with an acetonitrile–methanol mixture (3:1, v/v). The samples were then vortexed and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 min.

Measurements of Tissue Brain Natriuretic Peptide (Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)) A Rat Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) 45 ELISA Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom, ab108816) was used to test the levels of makers of congestive heart failure in right ventricular tissue extracts. Extract preparation and analysis were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Isolation of RNA and qPCR Analysis Total RNA was isolated from right ventricular tissues using TRI reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied BiosystemsTM, Foster City, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.",c3fc40ea-3199-4bb5-92bb-82dbbb90c819

These genes were chosen to characterize heart failure severity and cardiac hypertrophy. The reaction was carried out in an Applied Biosystems Prism 7500 instrument according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The relative expression levels of each of the genes of interest were calculated with the ΔΔCt method and were normalized to the expression level of the VCP gene.

Measurements of Mitochondrial Respiration in Permeabilized Cardiac Fibers Mitochondrial function was assessed in permeabilized cardiac fibers from the right ventricle that were prepared as previously described .",0ce946e9-2255-40bd-ada2-bb7f1492cb65
19,methods11," The mitochondrial respiration measurements were performed in MiR05 media (110 mM sucrose, 60 mM K-lactobionate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, 0.1% BSA essentially free of fatty acids) at 37°C using an Oxygraph-2k (O2k; Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria). Mitochondrial functionality measurements were performed using a previously described respirometry protocol (Makrecka-Kuka et al., 2020). Briefly, palmitoylcarnitine (PC) and malate (10 μM and 0.5 mM, respectively) were used to measure fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-dependent mitochondrial respiration (F(N)-pathway) in a substrate-dependent LEAK (L) state. Then, ADP was added to a concentration of 5 mM to initiate oxidative phosphorylation-dependent respiration (OXPHOS state). Next, pyruvate (5 mM, complex I substrate, N-pathway) was added to reestablish FN-pathway-linked respiration.",15b11384-863b-4197-91ca-a02fe80125df
20,methods12," Succinate (10 mM, complex II substrate, S-pathway) was added to reconstitute convergent FNS-linked respiration. Then, rotenone (0.5 μM, complex I inhibitor) and antimycin A (2.5 μM, complex III inhibitor) were added to determine the S-linked respiration and residual oxygen consumption (residual oxygen consumption (ROX)), respectively.  To determine the contribution of each substrate to the respiration rate, the flux control factor was calculated as follows:   1-Resp.rate before the addition of substrateResp.rate after the addition of substrate. To determine the mitochondrial mass in the heart, the citrate synthase activity in tissue homogenates was measured spectrophotometrically as previously described (Srere, 1969).

22,results0," Compared to the control treatment, the administration of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) (120 mg/kg) for 14 weeks increased the Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentration in cardiac tissues up to 14 times. monocrotaline (MCT) treatment led to impaired mitochondrial function and decreased right ventricular functional parameters. Although Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) treatment itself decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation-dependent respiration, no effect on cardiac functionality was observed. Long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration prevented monocrotaline (MCT)-impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism by preserving fatty acid oxidation and subsequently decreasing pyruvate metabolism.",61ea0091-b7d7-4d45-8361-6b6b3809ebf0
23,results1," In the experimental model of right ventricle heart failure, the impact of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) on energy metabolism resulted in a tendency to restore right ventricular function, as indicated by echocardiographic parameters and normalized organ-to-body weight indexes. Similarly, the expression of a marker of heart failure severity, brain natriuretic peptide, was substantially increased in the monocrotaline (MCT) group but tended to be restored to control levels in the Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)+monocrotaline (MCT) group.  Conclusion: Elevated Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels preserve mitochondrial energy metabolism and cardiac functionality in an experimental model of right ventricular heart failure, suggesting that under specific conditions Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) promotes metabolic preconditioning-like effects.",01ebafd9-9b9e-4b18-a5ab-949a27208f7f

Administration of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) at a dose of 120 mg/kg in the drinking water for 14 weeks did not affect direct right ventricular (RV) pressure, RV systolic and diastolic area or RV fractional area change (Table 1) as well as ejection fraction and fractional shortening of the left ventricle (Supplementary Table 2). Compared with the control, administration of monocrotaline induced a significant increase (~50%) in direct right ventricular pressure (Table 1). In addition, dilatation of the right ventricle was observed in the hearts of the animals in the monocrotaline (MCT) group, as indicated by 34 and 83% increases in the RV diastolic and systolic areas, respectively.",fff6fdb8-3358-450b-9c33-5065ad21aed4

Compared to those in the monocrotaline (MCT) control group, the direct RV pressure measurement was decreased by 22%, the RV diastolic and systolic areas were decreased by up to 27%, and therefore, the RV fractional area change was increased by 25% in the Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)+monocrotaline (MCT) group. None of the measured parameters in the Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)+monocrotaline (MCT) group were significantly different from those in the control group. Overall, these results indicate that chronically elevated Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels in plasma and cardiac tissue do not affect cardiac functionality, while long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration preserves myocardial mechanical function in monocrotaline-induced heart failure.",d4fa04de-4344-4c54-b4f6-7a55289e1af2

31,results9,"  In addition, long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration did not cause any significant changes in the expression of genes related to heart failure and hypertrophy (Figures 4A,B) or in the protein expression of Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)45 (Figure 4C). In the monocrotaline (MCT) group, a 3-fold decrease in the α/β-MHC expression ratio (Figure 4A) was observed, indicating a shift in favor of the β isoform caused by right ventricle hypertrophy. In addition, the expression of a maker of heart failure severity, Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), was upregulated by 12-fold in the monocrotaline (MCT) group (Figure 4B).

The gene and protein expression of Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) was lower in the Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)+monocrotaline (MCT) group than in the monocrotaline (MCT) group (Figures 4B,C). Moreover, measurements of total cholesterol, triglycerides and free fatty acids in plasma did not reveal any significant changes between experimental groups (Supplementary Table 3), therefore our observed effects of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) on cardiac function are independent of plasma lipid profile.

Long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration decreased the fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-dependent respiration rate by 69% in the OXPHOS state (Figure 5A), resulting in an 11% decrease in the fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-dependent OXPHOS coupling efficiency (Figure 5B).",83673bc7-a0fd-4e26-9900-f9ed5dd9efa7
35,results13," Although pyruvate metabolism input to overall respiration was increased by ~44% in the Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) group, as indicated by Flux control factor analysis (Figure 5B), it was not sufficient to restore FN and FNS pathway-linked mitochondrial respiration in the OXPHOS state (Figure 5A). In the monocrotaline (MCT) group, there was a 75% decrease in the fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-dependent respiration rate in the OXPHOS state (Figure 5A) and a subsequent 13% decrease in the fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-dependent OXPHOS coupling efficiency (Figure 5B). Similar to the Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) group, in the monocrotaline (MCT) group, pyruvate metabolism input to respiration was increased by 50% (Figure 5B), but this increase was not sufficient to restore FN- and FNS-pathway-linked respiration in the OXPHOS state (Figure 5A).",90d9be16-63ad-469b-a0d7-9ad99f216e68

Moreover, in the Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)+monocrotaline (MCT) group, mitochondrial energy metabolism was preserved, as shown by normalized respiration rates (Figure 5A), preserved fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-dependent oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and subsequently decreased pyruvate metabolism input (Figure 5B). Moreover, measurements of the citrate synthase activity (Supplementary Figure 2) in right ventricular tissue showed that there were no differences in mitochondrial mass between the experimental groups.",2a1d0a6e-4e37-444c-9644-a814a13a7d94
37,results15," Taken together, the obtained results show that long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration itself induces mitochondrial metabolic preconditioning by causing a switch from fatty acid utilization to pyruvate utilization without affecting electron transfer functionality; moreover, in right ventricle heart failure, Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) treatment can preserve cardiac mitochondrial energy metabolism.

39,discussion0,"In the present study, we demonstrate the effects of long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration on cardiac mitochondrial energy metabolism and on right ventricular heart failure progression. Although long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration decreases mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, it has no adverse effects on cardiac mechanical function. However, unexpectedly, long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration results in preserved mitochondrial energy metabolism, leading to reduced heart failure severity and maintained cardiac functionality. Taken together, these results suggest that elevated Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations can exert preconditioning-like effects and exhibit cardioprotective properties.  The role of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) as a risk factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases is widely debated around the world.",88796090-9b22-4664-b0e7-a4dcc0f6aaa9
40,discussion1," It has been shown that even a 100-fold increase in circulating Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels (up to 60 μM) in rats did not affect cardiac functionality . Similarly, no effects on cardiac parameters in mice were observed after 3 weeks of administration of 0.12% Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) in the chow . Although the Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentration in target tissues was not determined in previously mentioned studies, it has recently been shown that Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) at concentrations up to 10 mM does not affect cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential or ROS production in rat cardiomyocytes .",24bc98f8-f512-4fc5-94d6-6ab466ad70ad
41,discussion2," Our results complement previous findings, reporting the Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) level reached in cardiac tissue (up to 140 nmol/g tissue) after 14-week administration of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) in drinking water and, thus, provide a rationale behind further dose selection strategies in in vitro experiments. In our experimental design, Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) was administered directly (120 mg/kg in their drinking water) and no further metabolization was needed by gut bacteria. However, the possible interindividual variability caused by alterations in gut microbiota composition should be considered if Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) precursors (i.e., choline or carnitine) were administered during the experiment, since various bacterial genera are able to metabolize different precursors to synthesize trimethylamine (TMA) .",21c94bf6-e207-42fd-850d-dcfbd0fa5c6d
42,discussion3," It has also been shown that a retroconversion of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) to trimethylamine (TMA) is possible ; however, in our study a low variability of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels in right ventricular tissue was observed, suggesting that gut microbiota composition and trimethylamine (TMA)/Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) production capacity was similar in our experimental animals. Moreover, our results demonstrate that a long-term increase in plasma Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels up to 100 μM and a subsequent increase in Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels in cardiac tissue (up to 140 nmol/g tissue) do not affect cardiac function. In addition, recent studies indicated that Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration does not exacerbate the condition of already present stressors (Querio et al.",ac1aeee1-dd98-49b2-932e-359c7227762c
43,discussion4,", 2019), such as H2O2, which is a major contributor to oxidative stress (Nita and Grzybowski, 2016), and doxorubicin, which is known to cause disturbances in cardiac energy substrate metabolism similar to those caused by heart failure . In our experimental setup, long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration shifted mitochondrial energy substrate utilization from fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to glucose metabolism, but in contrast to the heart failure group, the Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) treatment group did not exhibit altered mitochondrial electron transfer system functionality. Since the shift from compensated cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure is preceded by respiratory complex I and II dysfunction (Griffiths et al.",c69edf2a-dd99-4d23-b8a3-866c615214ce
44,discussion5,", 2010), unaltered complex I and complex II function could explain our observations of maintained cardiac functionality even after 14 weeks of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration, notwithstanding altered energy metabolism. Overall, our findings suggest that despite this metabolic shift, long-term elevations in Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels in plasma and cardiac tissue do not exert detrimental effects on cardiac function.  Previously, increased plasma Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels in experimental models of heart failure led to worsening of cardiac parameters, suggesting that Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) is a detrimental factor in cardiovascular disease pathophysiology. It has been shown that administration of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) and its precursor, choline, exacerbates left ventricle remodeling and cardiac function loss .",fd89ad54-622b-4185-80e4-6f7a3a88c845
45,discussion6," Moreover, withdrawal of dietary Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) even 6 weeks after aortic constriction reversed those changes, indicating an ability of the heart to recover from detrimental changes caused by Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) . In addition, a reduction in circulating Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels by 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol or iodomethylcholine alleviated cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling after aortic banding . Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)-induced impairment in cardiomyocyte contractility and calcium handling  as well as T-tubule formation  were suggested as possible mechanisms that may link Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) to heart failure.",9ad813cf-f58f-4c67-8616-0dfd7b7776e5
46,discussion7," In contrast, our results demonstrate that an increase in Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels in plasma and tissues partially prevents the remodeling of the right ventricle and the development of right-sided heart failure. Previously, it has been shown that Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) treatment reduces cardiac fibrosis and improves cardiac functionality in a model of Spontaneously Hypertensive rats . Consistent with these findings, our study shows that Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration can partially prevent right ventricular hypertrophy as shown by normalized organ-to-body weight indexes and hypertrophy-related gene expression.",a8e2716e-af36-49b5-89c9-3a1ecab02165
47,discussion8," Moreover, consistent with our results, protective effects of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) were also observed in Spontaneously Hypertensive Heart Failure rats, in which long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) treatment improved survival and cardiac parameters and lowered plasma NT-proBrain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels (Gawrys-Kopczynska et al., 2020). Similarly, in our study, Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration preserved right ventricular function, as indicated by normalized direct RV pressure and RV fractional area change; moreover, Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) decreased the expression of a marker of heart failure severity, Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), in right ventricular tissue. In addition, a recent study showed that administration of betaine, a common Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) precursor, attenuated pulmonary artery hypertension .",24a86332-9073-4c93-8597-10d75fb0f5c9
48,discussion9," Interestingly, monocrotaline injection was used to induce pulmonary artery hypertension in the previous study; this is the same method we used in our study to induce right ventricle heart failure. Although ~100-fold less Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) is produced from betaine than from choline , at least to some extent, the observed protective effects of betaine might be explained by increased bioavailability of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O). Overall, previous and present observations suggest that long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration can reduce right ventricular remodeling and improve cardiac function in right-sided heart failure. Moreover, our findings also support the hypothesis that a Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)-rich Mediterranean diet may prevent and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases .",6147f7e6-8841-4fc7-b2af-5fff98a0791f
49,discussion10,"  The protective role of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) was previously explained by its ability to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress , oxidative-nitrative stress and the subsequent vascular and diabetic complications . More recently, some protective effects were attributed to the ability of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) to increase diuresis and natriuresis (Gawrys-Kopczynska et al., 2020). In addition, our study proposes preserved cardiac energy metabolism as a possible mechanism underlying the observed protective effects of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O). The heart is capable of adapting to both physiological and pathological stressors by shifting from fatty acid oxidation (FAO) as a dominant energy source to more pronounced utilization of glucose .",28811df9-9063-47c9-83fe-77781abd5b65
50,discussion11," In physiological states, this shift could be considered a preconditioning strategy, since the heart is thus better prepared for future stress conditions, such as hypoxia, due to higher reliance on more energy-efficient substrates in the case of oxygen deficiency . In the present study previously described metabolic shift was observed, when after long-term Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration fatty acid oxidation (FAO) was decreased, and pyruvate metabolism was subsequently increased without changes in cardiac functionality. It has been previously shown that Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) decreases fatty acid oxidation (FAO) with a mechanism not related to inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) (Makrecka-Kuka et al., 2017). Since we did not observe hindered pyruvate metabolism by accumulation of acylcarnitines, which might occur if carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) or CPT2 was inhibited (Chegary et al.",2bc4169b-0b7f-4bba-b43f-79fb721e9a9f
51,discussion12,", 2008; Makrecka et al., 2014; Makrecka-Kuka et al., 2020), most likely the decrease in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) induced by Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration is not related to direct inhibition of CACT or CPT2. Another possible explanation of our observation that Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) reduces fatty acid oxidation (FAO) could be that Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) indirectly inhibits CACT by a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanism . However, Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) is not reported to act as NO donor, moreover, it is shown to downregulate NO production in vitro  and in vivo . Thus, it is unlikely that Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) could cause indirect inhibition of CACT via NO pathway.",279046ee-102f-482f-880d-fbbdfbda80b7
52,discussion13," Overall, an increase in Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentration appears to induce a metabolic shift, possibly through direct inhibition of β-oxidation, toward more efficient substrate metabolism under stress conditions, such as hypoxia, thus ensuring preserved energy metabolism and subsequently improving cardiac function recovery after injury. Taken together, our results suggest that Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration exhibits cardioprotective properties during heart failure by maintaining metabolic flexibility and preserving fatty acid oxidation, both of which are vital strategies to restore cardiac bioenergetic balance . Moreover, our findings demonstrate that long-term consumption of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)-rich foods (i.e., Mediterranean diet) might induce metabolic preconditioning-like effects.",e53d7c72-ab84-446e-bc4a-584d81e6def4
53,discussion14,"  In conclusion, our study presents evidence that chronic Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) administration protects cardiac functionality by preserving mitochondrial energy metabolism in an experimental model of monocrotaline-induced right ventricle heart failure, where Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) acts as a preconditioning factor. In addition, our results provide a novel insight on the theory, that the role of Trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic diseases is not limited to either detrimental or protective effects, suggesting that it might actually be dual and depend on specific conditions.
