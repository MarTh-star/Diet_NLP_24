0,methods0,"4.1. C. elegans Maintenance The wild type C. elegans strain N2 (var. Bristol), the transgenic C. elegans strain OW13 (grk-1(ok1239); pkIs2386 [unc-54p::α-synuclein::yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) + unc-119(+)]) as well as the Escherichia coli feeding strain OP50 were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre (Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre (CGC), University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The C. elegans strain UA44 (baIn11[Pdat-1::α-synuclein, Pdat-1::green fluorescent protein (GFP)]) was kindly provided by the Caldwell laboratory (University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA) [107]. All nematodes were maintained on standard nematode growth medium (nematode growth medium (NGM)) agar plates at 22 °C, seeded with OP50 according to Brenner [108]. Prior to all tests, synchronized C. elegans populations were obtained by dissolving young adults in a 3% sodium hypochlorite solution according to Stiernagle [109].",df5be14c-9a65-42b1-bc17-00608be3e0e6
1,methods1," The obtained eggs hatched in M9 buffer overnight, and were transferred to new nematode growth medium (NGM) plates the following day. About 48 h later, L4 larvae were transferred to treatment and control plates. In order to inhibit the reproduction, 100 µM 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (FUdR) was added to each plate [110].  4.2. Polyphenol and Rotenone Treatment The treatment plates were prepared with the polyphenol hydroxytyrosol (HT; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA or with the aqueous olive pulp extract “HIDROX®” (HD). The HD extract was provided by Oliphenol LLC (Hayward, CA, USA), and total polyphenolic content of the HD extract was declared as 12% [111]. Among the polyphenolics, the major constituent of HD is hydroxytyrosol (40–50%), while other polyphenols present include oleuropein (5–10%), tyrosol (0.3%), and about 20% of other polyphenols including oleuropein aglycone and gallic acid [41].",829c5065-bb90-476a-ade4-57a858bf29bc
2,methods2," HD is a freeze-dried powder prepared from the acidic hydrolysis (citric acid 1%) of the aqueous fraction of olives extracted from the defatted olive pulp, a byproduct during the processing of olives (Olea europaea L.) for olive oil extraction [41]. Hidrox® is titrated on the total content of olive polyphenols (12%).  HT and HD were dissolved in bidistilled water at 60 mg/mL and the solutions were stored at −20 °C. HT or HD, respectively, were added to the bacteria and agar at a final concentration of 100–500 µg/mL.  To trigger the Parkinsonian phenotype, wild type nematodes were exposed to rotenone. A stock solution of 0.5 mg/mL rotenone was prepared in DMSO and added to a final concentration of 10 µM to the control and polyphenol plates. After distribution with a spatula and drying for 24 h in the dark, OP50 (including 10 µM rotenone and the respective polyphenol) was spread on the plates. L4 nematodes were transferred to the rotenone plates until they were used for bioassays.  4.3.",3a0f20e4-c74d-4cf1-a061-8564e5f322c8
3,methods3," Lifespan and Heat Stress Assay Synchronized wild type nematodes were observed with a stereo microscope and scored for their survival by gently touching them with a platinum wire. The animals were counted daily from the first day of adulthood until all died. Contaminated plates as well as vanished nematodes were censored. The heat stress test was performed according to the lifespan protocol, however, nematodes were stressed by heat (37 °C) for 3 h at the third day of adulthood and counting of dead and alive worms started 1 day after stress exposure.  4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis For the fluorescence observation, several nematodes were placed on a 2% agar pad on a microscope slide and anesthetized with 4 µL NaN3 (1M). The images were taken with the aid of the Axioskop fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and filter sets from the Zeiss 4880 series.",40a1f253-115a-46c5-b5b1-793bf0b8c313
4,methods4,"  To determine the autofluorescence in wild type nematodes, the images were captured at 100× magnification with a red filter set (TRITC, 545/30 nm ex, 610/70 nm em). In addition, bright field images were used to define the shape of each worm. The CellProfiler Software [112,113] was used to determine the mean red fluorescence intensity per total worm body.  The OW13 transgenic strain features yellow fluorescent protein linked to α-synuclein in the body wall muscle cells. Therefore, the nematodes were captured by using a yellow barrier filter with 100× magnification. The images were processed using the CellProfiler software and the yellow fluorescence intensity emitted per total worm body was calculated.  The UA44 transgenic strain features green fluorescent protein (GFP) linked to the dopamine transporter in the six dopaminergic neurons of the head and two in the tail as well as α-synuclein expression in dopaminergic neurons.",65dac035-62d7-4b07-b4fc-16a40f352083
5,methods5," To analyse the vitality of the neurons, the green barrier filter was used with a 200× magnification. The number of detectable anterior neurons were finally counted and assayed for patterns of degeneration, as described previously from Harrington et al. [55].  4.5. Swim Behaviour Assay Wells with a depth of 0.5 mm and Ø 10 mm were created with two self-adhesive marking films for microscope slides and filled with M9 buffer. 5 to 10 nematodes were transferred per well, covered by a cover slip, and recorded for 60 s with a connected camera. Each video was converted into single frames which were analysed with the CeleST software as described by Restif et al. [47] and Ibáñez-Ventoso et al. [48]. The wave initiation rate, the body wave number and the activity index were evaluated as representative parameters of locomotive behaviour.  4.6. Statistical Analysis All experiments were independently conducted at least two times. The Online Application for Survival Analysis (OASIS 2; https://sbi.",77f34a90-38be-49dd-854e-9e9433a79374
6,methods6,"postech.ac.kr/oasis2/) [114] was used for comparing survival differences between two conditions. Fluorescence intensities as well as swim behaviour parameters were calculated as mean ± SEM and statistical significance was calculated by two tailed t-test using GraphPad (https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/). Chi-square test was used to compare the number of worms with intact and degenerated neurons in the UA44 strain.  5. Conclusions Both polyphenol treatments—pure hydroxytyrosol and the natural preparation ‘Hidrox®’—were able to similarly improve the lifespan, stress resistance as well as age pigment accumulation in wild type nematodes. Furthermore, the beneficial locomotion effects of HD and HT are quite equally strong in the rotenone-stressed PD-model of C. elegans. However, the abilities of HD and HT also provide some differences: HD exposure led to much stronger beneficial locomotion effects in wild type worms compared to HT.",8cbc69f2-3e22-4204-bff6-d77f04a90bfd
7,methods7," Moreover, also the PD-model characterized by α-synuclein expression in muscles (strain OW13) did benefit significantly more from HD than HT. Only in the UA44 strain, which features α-synuclein expression in DA-neurons, the beneficial effects of HD and HT are rather weak with only one minor advantage of HD over HT. Thus, the hypothesis that HD features higher healthspan-promoting abilities than HT was only partly confirmed. Further studies are needed to uncover the molecular background mechanisms which led to this distribution of effects. Nevertheless, both polyphenolic treatments have the potential to partly prevent or even treat ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases and ageing itself. Future investigations including mammalian models and human clinical trials are needed to uncover the full potential of these olive ingredients. ",9c1bbbff-38fb-48ff-9ec5-9e639dcb4d02
