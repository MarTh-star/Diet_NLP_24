0,background0,"The term “oxidative stress” refers to imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of the oxidants that potentially could lead to damage [1, 2]. While it is well accepted that a low level of RONS production is necessary to maintain physiological function [1], on the other hand excessive formation of RONS is believed to cause damages in biomolecules. Defense systems against RONS include endogenous/exogenous antioxidants, scavenger enzymes and chelating proteins for pro-oxidant metals [3, 4]. Damage of lipids, proteins and DNA/RNA, to cellular and tissue level, as a consequence of oxidative stress has been linked not only to a number of serious diseases, including cancer, CVD but also accelerates the process of aging [5, 6].  Diet is thought to play a major role in the regulation of oxidative stress [7].",83520168-1f1a-4c7f-9d6c-169d02952f0f
1,background1," Many epidemiologic studies have reported an inverse association between consumption of vegetables, fruits, foods rich in antioxidant compounds and the risk of chronic diseases, especially cancer and CVDs [7, 8]. Several in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate the existence of bioactive components in fruits and vegetables, which could reduce oxidative status [9, 10]. Many vitamins could also act as anti-oxidants or could be implicated in the mechanisms of oxidative stress. However, the promising in vitro data concerning vitamins have not always been verified in vivo although many clinical trials have been conducted with vitamins (E, C or their combinations). Therefore, in vivo protective effect of vitamins and phytochemicals against the end point of several diseases remains uncertain [11–15]. Consequently, the possibility that the complex mixture of phytochemicals in foods may contribute to their protective effects has been raised [16].",9d84b09d-f973-4dd2-a402-4e23eb86bdf5
2,background2," In this concept, multiple compounds combination could act through complimentary or synergistic mechanisms to present a greater biological effect than the one single component.  Many natural products, especially herbs, have been investigated for their antioxidant activity. Aloe barbadensis miller or commonly known as Aloe vera has a long-standing tradition within herbal medicine. The processing of Aloe vera leaf pulp has become a large worldwide industry and it has been used as an ingredient in the production of functional foods and gel-containing health beverages [17]. So far in Aloe vera gel, over 75 different active constituents have been found and the major ones include minerals, amino acids, polyphenols and polysaccharides [17–20]. The antioxidant effect of Aloe vera has been reported both in vitro [21–25] and in vivo in animals [26].",5f299fc6-8bb7-4cde-9c6b-d03e6f33f4c9
3,background3," In detail, vitamins A, C, E, B1 (thiamine), B3 (niacin), B2 (riboflavin) and components such as choline, folic acid, phenolic compounds and polysaccharides act directly as free radical scavengers against DPPH radical, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide [17–20]. Also, it has been reported that Aloe vera reduces lipid peroxidation and the formation of hydroperoxides and inhibits prostaglandin E2 production from arachidonic acid probably through the ROS/NOS scavenging mechanism. Furthermore, Aloe vera seems to increase anti-oxidant enzymes e.g. SOD, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase. Finally, Aloe vera gel, specifically acemmanan and other polysaccharides, depicts immunomodulating effects that probably could modulate further oxidative stress [17–20]. On the other hand, the antioxidant effects of grapes are more studied.",57e5994e-52a6-4c34-a643-defb22936ab4
4,background4," Grape juice enhances the anti-oxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities [27], inhibits ROS production [28] and protects cells against DNA damage [28]. In specific, resveratrol, a phenolic phytochemical that is abundant in several plants such as grapes, and Polygonum cuspidatum, activates anti-oxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase, GPx, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, heme oxygenase), inhibits pro-oxidant enzymes (NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, myeloperoxidase) and acts as free radical scavenger [29, 30]. Camellia sinensis (green tea) mostly contains flavonoids and especially catechins. Catechins have been reported to exert anti-oxidant effect through activation of anti-oxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase, GPx), inhibition of pro-oxidant enzymes (NADPH oxidase, lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase, xanthine oxidase, inducible nitric oxide synthetase) and also by acting as free radical scavengers [31, 32].",8962de0c-3cf3-469a-8de6-298ce192b7ef
5,background5,"  Therefore, having in mind that there are no data about the anti-oxidant potential of Aloe vera in humans and also that Aloe vera gel improves the bioavailability of co-administrated vitamins in human subjects [33], it was hypothesized that a combination of vitamins (vitamin B1, folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin E) and phytochemicals (Gel of Aloe barbadensis miller, grape juice, green tea extract and Polygonum cuspidatum extract that contain resveratrol) may constitute an effective tool to protect against oxidative stress. To investigate this hypothesis, a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in order to study the effects of a multi-micronutrient supplement against oxidative stress in apparently healthy adults. Focusing on oxidative stress evaluation, lipid, protein and DNA/RNA end oxidative products, oxlipoprotein LDL (LDL), resistance of serum in oxidation as well as the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes were measured.

At 0, 4 and 8 week of intervention, participants were interviewed about the 3 days dietary intake using the 24-h recall method. Based on 24-h recall method data, adherence to Mediterranean diet was evaluated using the MedDietScore (range 0–55, with higher values indicating greater adherence) [36]. All food intake data were analyzed for energy and macronutrient content using the Diet Analysis Pro Programme. A physical activity questionnaire was used to evaluate the level of physical activity, which was expressed as physical activity levels (physical activity levels (PAL)) [37].  Gastrointestinal symptoms The subjects were asked to report any possible adverse events and gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated as a 7-d symptom score, using a daily questionnaire in which symptoms (i.e.",4bf278dd-b095-4e67-8379-0d4092247ef7

27,discussion0,"The main finding of this study is that the consumption of a multi-micronutrient supplement that provides vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals, could be effective in preserving production of isoprostanes and protecting DNA/RNA and protein against oxidative damage.  Oxidative stress along with inflammation and thrombosis play central role in many pathological situations such as atherosclerosis. Hence, antioxidant supplementation, mainly vitamin E and C, has been investigated. In this context, many descriptive studies suggest that antioxidant vitamin consumption reduces the CVD risk [11–15]. However, major randomized clinical trials revealed disappointing results and a recent meta-analysis concluded that high dose of vitamin E supplementation results in increased mortality [44]. In addition, although many studies investigating the effect of vitamins’ supplementation on the primary prevention of CVD have been conducted, the results are contradictory [45].",f7b7586f-307d-4b69-b845-3a6a6025f38a
28,discussion1,"  Even though a well balanced diet should be the first option, in some cases a need for nutritional supplements that could provide a well-balanced array of antioxidant nutrients, at relatively low dosages based on recommended dietary allowance (Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)) has been reported. Taking under consideration, that a well balanced diet includes a variety of micro-constituents, the hypothesis that antioxidant combination could be more effective than a single one, wins ever more ground. This lie in the possibility of synergistic or complementary action among the various antioxidants present in natural extracts that create a magnified effect.  Bearing in mind the previous hypothesis, a supplement that contains vitamins and plant extracts, mainly Aloe vera gel and also grape juice, green tea and Polygonum cuspidatum, could serve as a multi-functional source for a variety of chemically and functionally distinct antioxidants in a complex matrix.",0ca04933-9f6e-4005-be84-8a2330cb45c9
29,discussion2," The function of vitamins B occurs in mitochondrial reactions and energy metabolism. Thiamin (B1) prevents lipid peroxidation and its deficiency leads to mitochondrial toxicity and oxidative stress [46]. Concerning folate, recent data suggest that its reduced derivates could interact with the endothelial NO synthase and thus influence NO bioavailability and peroxynitrite formation [47]. The Aloe vera gel contains several components such as chromones, anthraquinones, polysaccharides, vitamins, enzymes, and low molecular weight substances, such as organic acids and minerals that have been shown to exert potent biological activities including antioxidant properties [20, 25, 48]. In addition, data also support that Aloe vera results in slower vitamins’ absorption and increases the bioavailability of co-administrated vitamins E and C in human subjects [33].",fa61fd4a-84a2-4853-9714-7a2bad5ad808

The volunteers that participated in the study were mainly overweight. Moreover, they were characterized by a medium level of adherence in Mediterranean diet based on the values of MedDietScore in accordance with the data from the general Greek population [57]. Generally, it has been suggested that studies of antioxidant supplements should include subjects with a low intake or poor status of antioxidant nutrients, to increase the likelihood of detecting an impact of the intervention. Based on food group analysis, the consumption of vegetables and fruits by participants in this study was low.  Many oxidative markers have been developed to evaluate the redox status in humans. Among them, the most commonly used are macromolecules’ end oxidation products.",ae9c5840-0df9-4fe7-8d8d-1bc7074ceb87

However, previous report indicates a reduction in liver malondialdehyde formation in mice after Aloe vera administration [58]. On the other hand, isoprostane levels seem to be altered during the study period, and more specific, volunteers consuming the supplement revealed resistance against lipid peroxidation in comparison to those ones to the placebo group. This is consistent with a previous study that revealed that an Aloe vera extract had a significant reduction in the F2-isoprostanes compared to placebo after 8 week supplementation [50].",816ed5fb-6a54-424a-943a-f04e61911372
33,discussion6," An increase was observed in isoprostane levels in the placebo group but it is difficult to ensure if the placebo composition is responsible for this effect since placebo contained Aloe barbadensis miller gel 3.6% vs 36% of the dietary supplement and some excipients in order to be similar in taste, appearance and color with the experimental formula. In addition, the serum resistance on ex vivo oxidation in the presence of Cu did not differ in any group or between groups during the intervention period. In contrast, a recent study observed that daily consumption of higher amount of Aloe vera extract (250 mL) increased total antioxidant capacity of serum after 14 days [49]. Concerning other plant extracts, the consumption of green tea extract in capsules, reduced the lipoprotein LDL (LDL) ability against oxidation in healthy men [59] while the consumption of tea did not affect urinary 8-isoprostane in a healthy population [60].",79fc7d22-662e-4ea6-b153-598cb2f98c48
34,discussion7," In women, the consumption of grape powder, rich in anthocyanins, quercetin, myricetin, kaempferol, and resveratrol, reduced the urinary F2-isoprostanes after 4 weeks [61]. Therefore, regarding our results, a mild protection against lipid peroxidation was achieved after the supplementation since only one of the four lipid peroxidation markers was altered.  Accumulating evidence suggests that DNA oxidative damage plays an important role in some chronic degenerative diseases. The DNA attack by hydroxyl radical generates a huge range of base and sugar modification products. Measurement of 8-hydroxy-2' -deoxyguanosine in urine has been used to assess rates of ‘whole-body’ oxidative DNA damage. In the present study, three oxidized guanine species from DNA and RNA were determined in urine and a significant reduction in supplementation group was observed, approximately of 15%, at 4 weeks and approximately 28% after 8 weeks of supplementation.",783885a2-d8cb-4744-b598-1c8d5c3df712
35,discussion8," This is in line with a previous report where polysaccharide fraction obtained from Aloe vera decreased in vitro oxidative DNA damage [62]. As far as other plant extracts are concerned, the consumption of Korean red ginseng reduced DNA oxidation in healthy volunteers after the 8-week supplementation [63]. In addition, the consumption of tea (containing approximately 250 mg of total catechins) reduced oxidative-induced DNA damage in lymphocytes in healthy volunteers [64] and the consumption of green tea polyphenols (500 mg daily) reduced urinary 8-OHdG concentrations in postmenopausal women with osteopenia [53].  Protein carbonylation is one of the most harmful irreversible oxidative protein modifications and is considered as a major marker of oxidative stress-related disorders. In the present study, a significant reduction of protein carbonyl levels, approximately of 20%, at 4 and 8 weeks, in supplementation group compared to placebo, was observed.",2723ab86-7e13-4dd3-934e-e83bbe8da910
36,discussion9," It should be noticed that the presentence of smokers was higher, although no significant, in the placebo group but it had lower baseline levels of protein carbonyls. However, no safe conclusion could be made concerning the interplay among smoking, levels of protein carbonyls and the observed effect since smoker’s and not smoker’s number per group is too small for a subgroup analysis. No reports concerning the effect of Aloe vera on protein oxidation exist. However, the daily consumption of vitamin C alone or in combination with α-tocopherol and folic acid for 10–15 weeks had no effect on protein carbonyl levels [65, 66] with the exception of subjects with low baseline ascorbate levels where a reduction was observed [66]. In addition, the consumption of green tea plus vitamin E reduced the plasma protein carbonyls in healthy elderly individuals after 12 weeks [67].",91036518-ad93-441f-8aee-3345acb35866
37,discussion10," Moreover, the consumption of an antioxidant-rich concentrate of berries reduced protein carbonyls in healthy volunteers at postprandial state [68]. The consumption of a Lemon verbena extract reduced protein carbonyl levels in young subjects at an aerobic training routine [69]. In contrast, the consumption of beetroot juice did not affect exercise-induced oxidative stress including protein carbonyls [70].  Crucial players in anti-oxidant defense are the antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT, and GPx. Superoxide dismutase catalyzes the formation of hydrogen peroxide from the superoxide radical and glutathione peroxidase catalyzes the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols and of free hydrogen peroxide to water. In response to supplementation, no changes in the specific activity of serum GPx were found. In contrast, leukocyte superoxide dismutase activity decreased significantly after 4 weeks of supplementation compared to baseline and placebo group.",232dca65-d849-46cf-89a9-19f9f5a4af11
38,discussion11," The observed decrease in leukocyte superoxide dismutase activity cannot be easily interpreted. It could be assumed that either the multi-nutrient supplementation acts as a direct scavenger of RONS and decreases the body’s need for certain antioxidant enzymes or may suppress its synthesis or shorten its half-life.  Among the limitations of the study is the fact that the participants were apparently healthy volunteers; therefore conclusions cannot be extrapolated to other populations meaning patients with several pathological conditions. Also, participants had medium adherence to a healthy dietary pattern (Mediterranean diet) and the results cannot be extrapolated to a population with optimal dietary intake. Furthermore, the evaluation of participants’ compliance to the study protocol was indirectly estimated by the measurement of the supplement’s volume that has not been consumed and not by measuring vitamins or other nutrients.",39a20816-248a-4cb0-8020-bb7f80578448
39,discussion12," Finally, it is not possible to know which component is responsible for the observed effect. Probably the effect is due to a synergistic action of the natural extracts and the vitamins.  Conclusion Overall, the data from the present study supports the idea that supplementation with a combination of natural extracts and vitamins significantly reduces in vivo oxidant damage of water soluble systems and in less extent the lipid-soluble ones.
