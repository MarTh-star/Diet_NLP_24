0,introduction0," Background and rationale {6a}  Fetal growth restriction (Fetal growth restriction (FGR)) is defined as the failure to achieve the endorsed growth potential in utero, and it affects 7–10% of all pregnancies [1]. Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is usually related to placental insufficiency and may present in association with other prevalent complications of pregnancy, mainly prematurity and preeclampsia [2]. The detection of small fetuses is clinically relevant, because it identifies a subgroup of pregnancies at high risk of poorer perinatal outcomes, such as intrauterine fetal death, severe intrapartum fetal distress, and perinatal brain injury [3, 4]. In addition, children born small have poorer neurobehavioral competencies [5] and more behavioral, sensory, and cognitive dysfunctions later in life [6, 7].",9d5e09a3-0a0d-49c7-abd2-f4c9d8efbbf5
1,introduction1," Being born small also expose them to a higher risk for subclinical cardiac dysfunction and hypertension in childhood [8] and a higher predisposition to cardiovascular disease in adult life [9]. While placental insufficiency seems a common feature in most cases of Fetal growth restriction (FGR), it is accepted that the etiology of Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is multifactorial. Recent research findings point at suboptimal maternal diet [10–12] and maternal stress [13, 14] (Miranda J, Macias-Redondo S, Paules C, Gomez ACF, et al: Maternal stress and placental RNA expression and methylation of the HSD11β2 gene in fetal growth restriction, submitted) as potentially important contributors.  Nutrition during pregnancy  The role of maternal and fetal nutrition is well accepted to have a profound impact not only on the early life growth and development, but also on the lifelong health of the individual [15].",1581bea5-550a-4712-9580-633c522fc9f1
2,introduction2," Maternal intake of several micronutrients related with fetal growth [16] has been reported to be commonly suboptimal in women from developed countries [17]. In a recent comprehensive metabolomic study [11], we observed alterations in the lipid profiles of Fetal growth restriction (FGR) fetuses and their mothers. Specifically, mothers of Fetal growth restriction (FGR) fetuses showed a low concentration of cholesterol and other lipoproteins, which might reflect increased uptake into the placenta and explain the reported increase in circulating triglycerides and cholesterol lipoproteins in growth-restricted fetuses.  Dietary pattern is a key factor in the prevention of several chronic diseases [18]. Concerning pregnancy, rather than individual constituents of food in the form of supplemental intakes of specific micronutrients [19–22], a dietary pattern as a whole may have a great role in achieving optimal maternal nutrition during pregnancy [23].",77c7e71f-474a-47a7-9fd7-cb4859d61c2c
3,introduction3," In this context, the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), rich in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids [24], is an attractive option. Known to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases in adults [18], the MedDiet could as well improve pregnancy outcomes and fetal growth. For instance, in a trial assessing the impact of diet on macrosomia, low adherence to the MedDiet was associated with low birth weight (BW) [25]. In pregnant women from the Generation R study in the Netherlands, both low and medium adherence to the MedDiet was associated with lower BW [10]. In two population-based cohort studies from Spain, higher intakes of fish, legumes, and dairy products were associated with higher infant BW and lower risk of Fetal growth restriction (FGR) [12]. Similarly, in women from the Danish National Birth Cohort, higher intake of Mediterranean foods reduced the risk for preterm birth [26]. However, all these studies were observational.",f7d96a99-2bc0-4067-83ed-de7a28097e37
4,introduction4," Therefore, randomized interventional studies powered to test the effect of MedDiet on fetal growth and perinatal outcomes are needed.  Stress during pregnancy  The association between maternal stress and Fetal growth restriction (FGR) has long been described [27]. An over-exposure to stress-induced maternal glucocorticoids has been proposed as a potential mediating mechanism [13, 28]. Evidence in rat models showed that maternal prenatal stress can downregulate the placental enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2) [29], essential to oxidize cortisol into cortisone. Recent studies in humans also found direct evidence that maternal prenatal anxiety and depression are associated with a downregulation of the 11β-HSD2 gene expression [30, 31]. Analyses on cord blood samples have revealed higher cortisol and lower adrenocorticotropic hormone levels in cases of Fetal growth restriction (FGR) [27].",81ad2500-2753-43b1-86d5-c52a1bdcbd0a
5,introduction5,"  In recent years, accumulating evidence supports the notion that adverse events or external negative stimulus during pregnancy affect maternal psychological well-being and have the potential to alter placental physiology with deleterious consequences in fetal development [14, 32]. In order to reduce stress in pregnancy, a non-pharmacological intervention would be desirable. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)) is a promising tool for treating anxiety and mood problems in patients with various clinical conditions [33]. There are few published studies on the use of MBRS programs in pregnancy. A recent meta-analysis pooling the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [34] reported a non-significant trend in favor of MBRS interventions to reduce anxiety, depression, and perceived stress. This may be due to a small number of RCTs and participants.",90ebcf0f-d3b4-4869-ab05-217e38665987
6,introduction6," The RCTs available were either pilot or feasibility studies, or not adequately powered to demonstrate the effectiveness of a Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention. A small study suggested that mindfulness-related skills were associated with a reduced chance of delivering a low-BW newborn [35]. Thus, more robust evidence is needed on the impact of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) strategies on perinatal outcomes.  Justification for the study  Maternal psychological status and dietary pattern are both fundamental for pregnancy well-being and contribute to shape the growth and development of the fetus and future child [36]. The biological plasticity of fetal life renders pregnancy a highly susceptible period for inducing positive effects mediated by lifestyle, particularly in high-risk situations.",a9db263b-7359-491a-bc4d-b112c321585f
7,introduction7," We hypothesized that lifestyle interventions focusing on improving nutrition and stress well-being could have an impact on improving fetal growth and perinatal outcomes in high-risk pregnancies.  Objectives {7}  Our main hypothesis is that structured lifestyle interventions to improve nutrition based on MedDiet or to reduce stress with Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)-based strategies will have an impact in improving fetal growth, perinatal outcomes, and infant development in high-risk pregnancies.  Primary objective  The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of the interventions (MedDiet and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)) on the rate of Fetal growth restriction (FGR) at birth.",9546ffdb-ff35-40e1-9272-f8cb3414493a

9,background0," Fetal growth restriction (Fetal growth restriction (FGR)) affects 7–10% of all pregnancies resulting in a higher risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality, long-term disabilities, and cognitive impairment. Due to its multifactorial etiology, changes in maternal lifestyle, including suboptimal maternal diet and stress, have increasingly been associated with its prevalence. We present a protocol for the Improving Mothers for a better PrenAtal Care Trial Barcelona (IMPACT BCN), which evaluates two different maternal lifestyle strategies (improved nutrition by promoting Mediterranean diet and stress reduction program based on mindfulness techniques) on perinatal outcomes. The primary objective is to reduce the prevalence of Fetal growth restriction (FGR).

The intervention consists of 8 weekly sessions of 2.5 h plus one-full day session (20–25 people) and daily home practice. There is continuous monitoring/support by dedicated instructors to support practice and provide counseling throughout the 8 weeks and until delivery. Thus, after the program, extra weekly sections with meditations/yoga, sharing moments among women, and pregnancy-related problems will be offered by trained nurses to maintain adherence and practice.",5623fc56-86da-46e0-8af5-5957d01c0a29
15,methods5," During sessions, mindfulness meditation skills are taught to help participants discover relationships between mindful practice and increase the ability to deal more effectively with stress. The sessions include didactic presentations, formal meditation practices, and group discussion. Home practice consists of 45’ of daily formal practice (e.g., sitting and walking meditation, body scan, and yoga stretching) and informal practice (e.g., mindfulness of daily activities and the 3-min breathing space). MP3s/CD of formal meditations adapted to pregnancy are provided for home practice, as well as a book and a notebook with relevant readings and the possibility to register their training.

Population per-protocol (PP), defined as all subjects included in mITT that participated in at least one visit without protocol deviation that might impact the study’s main assessments. The protocol deviation considered in this study is the low compliance with treatments. The next compliance criteria will be a reason for exclusion: Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) group: the patient attends less than 6 of 9 sessions (<67%).  Nutrition group: the patient has a MedDiet score at final assessment <3 from the initial score.  The patient who withdrew informed consent will be excluded from all populations.",77822041-4972-4acc-9472-3425b6a919d7
36,analysis2,"  The main study analysis will be performed using the mITT, pre-randomization and baseline analyses, and primary and secondary efficacy analyses. The primary outcome analysis will also be performed using also ITT population as a supportive, PP population to test the robustness of the results.  No inferential analysis will be performed for the baseline comparability.  The SAS System3 (Release 9.4 or an upgraded version) or R version 3.5.2 (or upgrade version) will be used to analyze the datasets. Details for the statistical analyses are available in the statistical analysis plan, made by the external statisticians.  Interim analyses {21b}  An interim analysis is planned at 50% of the study recruitment using the O’Brien-Fleming approach. The alpha-adjusted nominal level will be 0.0015 one-sided (0.0031 two-sided) at the interim look and 0.0245 one-sided (0.0490 two-sided) at the final analysis.  Methods for additional analyses (e.g.",e782f790-d9d8-45b7-89b5-3ac58c901958
37,analysis3,", subgroup analyses) {20b}  For the secondary analyses, no alpha adjusted will be made; all secondary statistical tests will be applied with a 0.05 two-sided significance level due to the exploratory purpose. All details are explained in the statistical analysis plan.  Methods in analysis to handle protocol non-adherence and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c}  The handling of missing data will follow the principles specified in the ICHE9 [53] and the CPMP/EWP/1776/99. Guideline on Missing Data in confirmatory trials [54].  Formal imputations will be only performed for the main variable (proportion of newborns with a BW <10th centile) where missing data will be imputed by the following two strategies: The main missing imputation strategy: the worst case will be imputed for all causes of missing data, i.e., BW < 10th centile.  The secondary missing imputation strategy: multiple imputation with the observed rates in the control group in all cases.",743cda62-68ec-4f3a-963f-48deb43fc2c1
38,analysis4,"  The main analysis will be considered the worst-case imputation and the multiple imputation will be a sensitivity analysis.  For the remaining efficacy variables, no formal imputation will be performed, and the available data-only approach will be used. For the continuous efficacy variables, since the predefined approach mixed models for repeated measurements [55–57] is robust to assess the presence of missing at random, the analysis will be done with all subjects despite the presence of missing data. Of note, this method calculates the estimations based on the variance-covariance structure but without any formal imputations.

Composition of the data monitoring committee, its role, and reporting structure {21a}  An independent clinical trial unit will perform offline data auditing every 6 months to check for missing information and errors. The sites will be notified of any deviation from the standard recommendations for amendment. The Data Monitoring Committee (Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)) is independent from the trial researchers and is responsible for monitoring the progress of the trial including recruitment and protocol adherence and will also evaluate the results of the interim analysis, completely blind to any personnel external to the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).",222d0fde-3c3b-4b06-8e15-145b23d24029

However, principal investigators will collect any adverse event and will communicate it to the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).  Frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23}  The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will give one to two reports during the trial. The processes reviewed related to participant eligibility, consent, and enrollment will periodically be revised by trained researcher members. All medical records related to the endpoints will be examined by trained and research staff members, blinded to the group assignment.  Plans for communicating important protocol amendments to relevant parties (e.g., trial participants, ethical committees) {25}  Protocol modifications will be approved by the ethical committee of the hospital.

We plan and commit to provide care in our hospital for participants’ health care ancillary needs that may arise during trial participation (e.g., any maternal morbidity detected by the stress and well-being questionnaires, any fetal malformation detected by fetal US or magnetic resonance). Ours is a public hospital that can cover any maternal (at Departments of Psychiatry and Phycology, and Internal Medicine, Hospital Clínic), fetal (at the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Department, Hospital Clínic-Hospital Sant Joan de Déu), or infant (at the Neonatology Department, Hospital Clínic-Hospital Sant Joan de Déu) morbidity raised during the trial with no need to provide extra pay.
