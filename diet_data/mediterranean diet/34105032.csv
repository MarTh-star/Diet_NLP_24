0,methods0," 2.1. Inclusion Criteria and Search Strategy  To systematically review all studies published in peer-reviewed journals evaluating the relationship between the Med diet and Age related macular degeneration (AMD), searches were performed on the 13th and 14th of October 2021 using the following platforms: PubMed/MEDLINE (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, accessed on 13 October 2021), Cochrane CENTRAL (https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central, accessed on 13 October 2021), and ScienceDirect (https://www.sciencedirect.com/, accessed on 14 October 2021).",784be5cf-ee4a-408c-b7bc-1b50406c08d7
1,methods1," The search strategy included keywords in combination as MeSH terms and text words, selected to capture all the relevant literature, and was structured using the appropriate Boolean operators as follows: (“Retinal Diseases”(MeSH) OR “Retina”(MeSH) OR “retinal disease” OR retina OR “macular degeneration” OR maculopathy) AND (“Diet, Vegetarian”(MeSH) OR “Diet, Mediterranean”(MeSH) OR “plant-based diet” OR vegetarian OR Adventist OR “Mediterranean diet” OR “blue zone” OR “dietary lifestyle” OR “dietary pattern”). The query was formatted according to each search engine used, and in particular for ScienceDirect it was subdivided based on the number of allowed Boolean operators (eight). Searches were not restricted by date or language, and additional articles were extracted from reviews retrieved within searches, and from reference lists of selected articles. This step was manually performed by screening the title of articles within reference lists for relevant terms and concepts.",e495e413-0478-455e-8c2c-50d629a36cce
2,methods2," Search results were combined, and duplicates removed, using the reference management software “EndNote”. After this stage, only “research papers” were considered further among the articles retrieved from ScienceDirect. This phase was performed by a single author (A.G.), and checked by a second author (F.G.). A list of abstracts was compiled in order to perform a first screening to evaluate whether the articles met the eligibility criteria: (i) human interventional or observation studies, and (ii) evaluation of the relationship between dietary patterns and Age related macular degeneration (AMD) or macula-related abnormalities. Meta-analyses, systematic reviews, animal and in vitro studies, and case reports, were excluded. The full texts of the short-listed manuscripts were obtained, and a final selection based on more stringent criteria was performed.",ae7d0b33-fb68-4b5c-8c53-9b250b59f6d9
3,methods3," These criteria included: (i) evaluation of adherence to the Med diet as exposure variable, and (ii) evaluation of the incidence and/or progression of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) or related macula pathological alterations as outcome in relation to adherence to the Med diet. The full selection process was first carried out by A.G., and then checked by F.G., and followed the guidelines by The PRISMA Group, the widely employed 27-item checklist used to enhance the transparency of systematic reviews. These items comprise all parts of the review, from title, abstract, to introduction, methods, results, discussion, until funding [38].  2.2. Assessment of Quality  The quality of retrieved studies was assessed according to the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for case-control and cohort studies, and using a modified version of this scale for cross-sectional studies [39,40].",ae24ec0c-871c-4fd9-9f99-7c487a511bab
4,methods4," Both scales evaluate studies based on three areas (selection, comparability, and outcome/exposure) and have a star-based scoring system, but differ regarding the maximum possible score allowed: for the original Newcastle–Ottawa scale this is 9 stars (with a maximum of 4, 2, and 3, respectively, for each section), whilst for the modified version this is 10 stars (with a maximum of 5, 2, and 3, respectively, for each section). Case-control and cohort studies were deemed high quality if they had a score ≥ 7, medium quality with 4–6 stars, and low quality with ≤3 stars [41]. Cross-sectional studies were considered high quality with 8–10 stars, medium quality with 6–7 stars, and low quality with ≤5 stars [42].  3. Results  3.1. Search Outcomes and Study Quality Assessment  A flow diagram was created to keep track of the systematic search, as shown in Figure 1. This was adapted from [38,43]. The initial search yielded a total of 1741 potentially relevant articles.",2ae5c108-b41e-4ce3-902f-bbb1edf1f6e4
5,methods5," The removal of duplicates and nonresearch articles from those retrieved from ScienceDirect, left 558 studies that were screened on the basis of the abstract and the title. The 536 articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria were removed. The full texts of the remaining 22 studies were obtained and assessed for eligibility, applying the more stringent selection standards described above. Of these, 14 were discarded, and 8 were thoroughly analysed and included in this review. A summary of information extracted from these can be found in Table 1, where studies are presented in chronological order. Of the eight manuscripts analysed, one described a retrospective study [44], two had a cross-sectional design [36,45], two were nested case-control studies derived from the same cross-sectional population-based study [46,47], and three were prospective studies [48,49,50].  The assessment of the quality of the studies is reported in Supplementary Tables S1–S3.",91eada7b-8efc-4bab-b93a-0e997b8a2bc5
6,methods6," All cohort studies were deemed of high quality [44,48,49,50], but all of them were given zero stars regarding the representativeness of the exposed cohort, which was considered limited as they all analysed selected groups of participants, and therefore were not representative of the community. They all gained excellent scores in most areas apart from a cohort study included in the article from 2019 by Merle et al. [49]. This manuscript included two cohorts, which were evaluated separately for quality (Supplementary Table S1). The duration of one of these cohorts, the Alienor study, was considered inappropriate (four years) [51]. Of note, all abovementioned studies included robust methods for the assessment of outcome, which was generally performed by expert ophthalmologists using validated procedures such as retinal photographic grading, which is the current gold standard for Age related macular degeneration (AMD) assessment.",40da1639-2ec2-40ec-ba7e-b3e0691093b3
7,methods7," All manuscripts, except one [48], clearly reported performing evaluation of exposure through interviews carried out by trained personnel. Both case-controls studies were deemed of high quality [46,47], but lost one star for failure to mention whether the assessment of exposure was performed through interview blinded to case/control status, and another one for not reporting “nonresponse rate”. The two cross-sectional studies [36,45], evaluated by the modified Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, were considered of high quality, gaining the maximum number of stars in each area, apart from the “nonrespondents” section, because of failure to mention the response rate, and the “representativeness of the sample” section for Mares et al. because the participants were represented by a selected subgroup of people from another study, and included only females [36].",30c9907c-77e6-4507-9913-092ba5516ae3
8,methods8," Of note, all eight studies were given full scores for “comparability” as they all accounted for the most important confounding factors such as smoking, age, and gender.  3.2. Details and Characteristics of the Studies  The assessment of the adherence to a certain diet is done using scoring systems that generally evaluate how a person’s food habits, ascertained through food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), relate to certain standards of consumption of predetermined food groups. The standards and the food groups may vary among scoring systems appraising the same dietary pattern, so similar studies may implement different methodologies. This is the case for the Med diet, for which a number of possible protocols are used. Since one of the key points of the manuscripts analysed in this systematic review is the evaluation of the adherence to such diet, a brief overview of the different scoring systems will be given next.",47ff6067-a05e-40bd-9bdc-3c5604aa1b2e
9,methods9,"  The original method for scoring compliance to the Med diet (mediSCORE in the text and Table 1) was devised by Trichopoulou et al. and validated in a Greek population [52,53]. The score is based on the intake of 9 items: vegetables, legumes, fruit and nuts, dairy, cereals, meat and meat products, fish, alcohol, and monounsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids (MUFAs-to-SFAs) ratio. Intakes above the median of the study receive 1 point; all other intakes receive 0 points. Meat and dairy product consumption less than the median receive 1 point. For ethanol, a value of 1 is assigned to men who consume 10–50 g/day and to women who consume 5–25 g/day; possible scores range from 0 to 9.  nutrients-14-02028-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Characteristics of the eight studies included in this review evaluating the association between the Mediterranean diet and Age related macular degeneration (AMD).",c46125fe-f65a-40ca-a09f-e5f52a15d254

30,methods31," The key food items, the number of points assigned, and the set thresholds in this method follow: olive oil (1 point for ≥1 spoon/day), wine (1 point for ≥1 glass/day), fruit (1 point for ≥1 serving/day), vegetables or salad (1 point for ≥1 serving/day), fish (1 point for ≥3 servings/week), legumes (1 point for ≥2 servings/week), meat or meat products (1 point for <1 serving/day). A further point is awarded for a daily serving or more of both fruits and vegetables, and a final point is awarded when consumption of both white bread (<1 serving/day) and rice (<1 serving/week) is low or when consumption of whole-grain bread is high (>5 servings/week). As in the abovementioned systems, possible scores range from 0 to 9 points. Of the eight studies included in this systematic review, three scored the adherence to the Med diet using the original scoring system by Trichopoulou et al. [53]. In the manuscripts by Nunes et al. and by Raimundo et al.",36c0fddf-adba-4cc7-92e8-4517bcfa67a4
31,methods32," [46,47] all points were attributed as described above, whilst in the 2019 article by Merle et al. [49], thresholds differed from the original model for the alcohol group: 1 point was given for consumption equivalent to 1–10 g/day for women and to 5–15 g/day for men, and 0 otherwise. All these studies were performed on European cohorts. The four articles that included American cohorts all employed the aMED score, although applying some modifications compared to the model proposed by Fung et al. [54]. In the manuscript by Mares et al. [36], 1 point is assigned not based on median intakes but as follows: (1) servings of each of the following food components greater than the 75th percentile within the sample: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, fish, and the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat; (2) less than the 25 percentile for servings of red meat; and (3) alcohol intake of 5 to 25 g/day. Instead, in two of the papers by Merle et al.",19af80bd-89e8-4cec-be82-0640d81dd772
32,methods33," [48,50], alcohol consumption was evaluated as follows: 1 point to women or men if consumption was within the third quartile of distribution of total alcohol consumption in that population, chosen to represent mild to moderate consumption. In the studies by Keenan et al. [44], the aMED score was modified and adherence level was assessed by quartile ranks (rather than above or below the median) by dividing each food category in quartiles and assigning a score to each quartile, with quartile 4 corresponding to highest intake and therefore highest score (4), except for meat consumption where scoring was reversed (quartile 4 = 1), and for alcohol intake which was converted to a binary format: 4 for intake within the specified intervals and 1 for intake above or below the specified intervals. To calculate the aMedi score for each participant, the quartile values for the 9 components were summed (range 9–36).",da02b040-ee92-469b-8485-375ee835261e
33,methods34," This method was used to capture more accurately the variation observed in these cohorts. In the same study, the authors also performed sensitivity analyses using the classical aMedi score, as described above. Only one study (Hogg et al. [45]) used the score proposed by Martinez-Gonzales et al. [58].  Early/intermediate and late Age related macular degeneration (AMD) stages can be documented by retinal colour fundus images, and similarly to the assessment of the adherence to the Med diet, several systems are used to classify Age related macular degeneration (AMD) both clinically and for research purposes.",8a4e7f98-bc38-4041-b5db-3b07c36a771a
34,methods35," The grading methods employed in the articles analysed in this review are explained in the legend for Table 1 and consist of: Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System (Wisconsin Age Related Maculopathy Grading System (WARMGS)), which is used by two manuscripts [44,49]; the Clinical Age-Related Maculopathy Staging (Clinical Age Related Maculopathy Staging (CARMS)), applied by one study [48]; the International Classification System (International Classification System (ICS)) employed by three studies [45,46,47]; and a modified version of the Wisconsin Age Related Maculopathy Grading System (WARMGS) used by Mares et al. [36]. Furthermore, in the 2020 article by Merle et al. [50] a different grading system is employed, as detailed in the legend of Table 1. These systems differ mostly in their way to classify early/intermediate Age related macular degeneration (AMD), and are all based on different combinations of presence, type, size and/or area of drusen, and pigmentary changes.",ec535aa3-873b-4477-96e9-4c51abf580e3
35,methods36," On the other hand, the definition of late Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is reasonably homogeneous across classification systems, even though some systems such as the Clinical Age Related Maculopathy Staging (CARMS) have two separate categories for GA and nvAge related macular degeneration (AMD) (4 and 5, respectively), whilst the International Classification System (ICS) put these two forms of advanced Age related macular degeneration (AMD) into a single group. The Wisconsin Age Related Maculopathy Grading System (WARMGS) has the peculiarity of also taking into consideration the consistency of drusen, dividing them into soft and hard, which is somehow a less objective measure, not taken into consideration by the other systems.",bf6c431b-7209-4a82-b263-1b5c1b79f2d2
36,methods37,"  All manuscripts considered for the present systematic review were part of larger studies investigating different aspects of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) and its association with different behavioural factors, not necessarily including the adherence to the Med diet. To better frame the articles analysed here, some information is given concerning these studies. Three of them, the Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) (Age-Related Eye Disease Study of the NIH National Eye Institute), the Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)2, and the CAge Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) (Carotenoids in Age-Related Eye Disease Study), represent American cohorts, with Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)/Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)2 being randomised controlled trial (RCT)s, and CAge Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) being an ancillary study of the WHIOS (Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study) [56].",aecd3af8-a315-4810-9c27-c47512919f84
37,methods38," In the Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), 4757 participants (55–80 years) were recruited (1992–1998) at 11 US retinal specialty clinics and enrolled into Age related macular degeneration (AMD) categories (no Age related macular degeneration (AMD) to unilateral late Age related macular degeneration (AMD)). The participants were randomly assigned to placebo, antioxidants, zinc, or the combination, and the randomised controlled trial (RCT) lasted 5 years. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of antioxidant and mineral supplements on the risk of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) together with progression to advanced Age related macular degeneration (AMD).",df7f739c-b853-464b-a9c4-60bc934a6a00
38,methods39," In Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)2, 4203 participants (50–85 years) with bilateral large drusen or unilateral late Age related macular degeneration (AMD) were recruited (2006–2008) at 82 US retinal specialty clinics, and the participants were randomly assigned to receive the supplements that lowered risk of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) progression in the Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) (1) alone or with additional (2) lutein/zeaxanthin, (3) docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) plus eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)), or (4) the combination [44]. Similarly, the randomised controlled trial (RCT) lasted 5 years. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the abovementioned supplementation in reducing the risk of developing advanced Age related macular degeneration (AMD) [44].",f513124a-2f33-4302-b69c-7a80d3171ac1
39,methods40," The three studies that used data from Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)/Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)2 [44,48,50] adjusted their statistical models for the treatments received by the participants. The other American study, the CAge Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), used data collected at WHIOS baseline on dietary and lifestyle habits of the participants on average six years before Age related macular degeneration (AMD) was assessed [36]. In the WHIOS, 93,676 women were enrolled at forty centres throughout the US (1993–1998), and the aim was to explore the predictors and natural history of important causes of morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women [59]. The CAge Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) women were enrolled among those recruited at three of the forty sites, and were those who had intakes of lutein plus zeaxanthin that were above the 78th and below the 28th percentiles.",c5e925f1-1ae9-41a2-aee9-eb16660bbf97
40,methods41," This choice was made because the intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin significantly correlate with the intake of other healthy foods/nutrients, and this design would maximise statistical power to detect associations with these related aspects of diet [46]. Another study, of which one of the manuscripts analysed here is a part of, is the European Eye (EUREYE) study, which enrolled 4753 participants older than 65 years from seven countries across Europe with widely differing cultures and dietary patterns between 2001 and 2002 [45,55]. It was developed to provide estimates of the prevalence of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) and to examine associations with lifestyle and environmental factors.",3b0cece9-3eec-432c-9bae-17009c5ee51a
41,methods42," Two manuscripts [46,47] were nested in the Coimbra eye study, a cross-sectional population-based study of the prevalence of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) in Portugal, which recruited 6000 participants over 55 years of age from primary healthcare units in two locations in the centre of Portugal, one in the coastal area (Mira) and the other 70 km away from the sea (Lousã), from 2009 to 2011. A single article analysed two cohorts part of the EYE-RISK project (2015–2019), a large study aiming to identify risk factors, molecular mechanisms, and therapeutic approaches for Age related macular degeneration (AMD) using data from sixteen European epidemiological cohorts in six countries (Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, France, UK, Switzerland) [49].",49693242-001e-4dd8-88c4-f07a0ec7a434
42,methods43,"  Although the aims of this systematic review do not include the evaluation of the interactions between the Med diet and certain genetic polymorphisms associated with Age related macular degeneration (AMD), it is worth mentioning that four of the studies analysed here investigated this relationship. It is known that certain genetic variants either increase or decrease the risk of developing Age related macular degeneration (AMD). Among the genes involved, there are the following seven: complement factor H (complement factor H (CFH)), age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2/high-temperature requirement A serine peptidase 1 (ARMS2/HTRA1), complement component 2 (C2), complement factor B (complement factor B (CFB)), complement component 3 (C3), collagen type VIII a 1 (COL8A1), and RAD51 paralog B (RAD51B). These were analysed in the study by Merle et al.",be103df5-a73d-45c6-8950-fccbaf2a7e2a
43,methods44," [48] in which a high aMED diet score was associated with lower odds of developing advanced Age related macular degeneration (AMD) in subjects carrying a particular polymorphism of the complement factor H (CFH) gene (complement factor H (CFH) Y402H) considered nonrisk, whist this association was not present in subjects who were homozygous for a risk allele. This was the first study investigating whether genetic susceptibility could modify the association between the entire diet (rather than specific nutrients) and Age related macular degeneration (AMD). Hogg et al. [45] instead found that the relationship between MDS score and the risk of developing Age related macular degeneration (AMD) was not influenced by the Y204H allele. A later article by Merle et al. investigating two different cohorts from the EYE-RISK consortium also found no association between complement factor H (CFH) Y402H and the mediSCORE, and this was true for another gene, the ARMS2 [49].",80aef119-0563-4e07-a425-7db3013e3b35
44,methods45," In the manuscript by Keenan et al. [44], the interaction between the aMED and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at two loci with the highest attributable risk to late Age related macular degeneration (AMD), ARMS2 rs10490924 and complement factor H (CFH) rs10922109, were analysed. In Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), higher aMED was associated with decreased risk of late Age related macular degeneration (AMD) only in participants with complement factor H (CFH) protective alleles, whereas no significant association was found in Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)2, along with with ARMS2 alleles in both studies.  3.3. Incidence and Prevalence of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) and the Mediterranean Diet  Four of the manuscripts included in this systematic review investigated Age related macular degeneration (AMD) incidence or prevalence in relation to the adherence to the Med diet [36,45,46,47]. In the article by Mares et al.",d875b68d-c746-44d8-841a-e4f512041fb9
45,methods46,", the incidence of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) over a period of 6 years was lower in people with higher aMED score (−66%). Importantly though, this association was no longer significant after adjustment for physical activity, suggesting that the effect of the Med diet was not totally independent from this other lifestyle factor. It is worth noting that the number of participants with a high aMED score (Q4 = 6–9) was small (n = 53) in comparison with those in Q1 (n = 490) (Table 1). Since the comparison was made between Q4 and Q1, this might have had an effect on the results. In addition, Mares et al. also investigated the relation between whole diet and the risk of early Age related macular degeneration (AMD) using the Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)), showing that CAge Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) participants with the highest quintile of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) had lower odds of early Age related macular degeneration (AMD) (−46%).",0de8cce5-e345-40b5-ae1d-314ca64ba570
46,methods47," In the article by Hogg et al., where prevalence of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) was stratified by Age related macular degeneration (AMD) stages, higher adherence to the Med diet decreased the odds of developing nvAge related macular degeneration (AMD) in unadjusted and confounder-adjusted analysis by 48% and 47%, respectively, but did not have significant effects on other forms of the disease (Table 1). In the two case-control studies by Nunes et al. and by Raimundo et al., a high mediSCORE was associated with a lower prevalence of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) (−27% and −38%, respectively). These investigations also analysed the different food groups of the Med diet and found that high intake of vegetables, nuts, and fruit drove the association between the mediSCORE and Age related macular degeneration (AMD), decreasing the odds by 10% to 36% compared to lower consumption (Table 1).  3.4.",000c5046-681e-431f-ab77-89e79b19ee74
47,methods48," Progression of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) and Related Retinal Abnormalities and the Mediterranean Diet  The other four articles analysed here investigated the influence of the Med diet on disease progression [44,48,49,50], including one by Merle et al. from 2020 specifically studying the progression of drusen size rather than Age related macular degeneration (AMD) per se, drusen being an hallmark of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) [50]. In the article by Merle et al. from 2015 [48], the authors demonstrated that higher aMED score decreased the risk of progression of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) by 36% (aMED T3 vs. aMED T1, Table 1). Additionally, food group analyses showed that higher vegetables and fish consumption lowered the odds of progression by 15% and 14%, respectively, in the adjusted model. In a subsequent study by Merle et al.",135bb1ca-9428-445e-9b79-c769c5b78042
48,methods49," considering two European cohorts, the Rotterdam Study I (RS-I) and the Antioxydants, Lipides Essentiels, Nutrition et maladies Oculaires (Alienor) study [50,51], the risk of progression to advance Age related macular degeneration (AMD) was diminished by high mediSCORE compared to low only in the RS-I and in the combined analysis (RS-I and Alienor study together, −44% and −47%, respectively, Table 1), but not in the Alienor study alone, in the unadjusted model. In the adjusted model, the odds were reduced only in the combined analysis (–41%). Age related macular degeneration (AMD) subgroup analysis showed that there was no association between mediSCORE and nvAge related macular degeneration (AMD), whilst the risk was lowered for GA only in RS-I and combined analysis, but not in the Alienor study alone (−69% and 68%, respectively, Table 1).",c28d7a64-3d28-4f87-a18d-e3a02ef3de2f
49,methods50," Furthermore, the inverse association between the adherence to the Med diet and Age related macular degeneration (AMD) progression remained after adjustment for two SNPs (see above). These results are somehow in contrast with the results by Hogg et al. [45], which showed that higher adherence to the Med diet was associated with lower odds of nvAge related macular degeneration (AMD) but not GA. Analysis of the interaction between the single food groups of the mediSCORE and Age related macular degeneration (AMD) progression did not reveal any association. Similar results were instead reported by Keenan et al. in two American cohorts, the Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and the Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)2 [44]. Retrospective analysis of these two studies showed that higher modified aMED score (assessed as described earlier) was associated with lower odds of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) progression (−13% aMED T2 vs. T1, and −22% aMED T3 vs.",02ac0edc-61e3-4361-b642-0ec321d4d5ed
50,methods51," T1; Table 1) in combined cohorts, with subtype analysis revealing a decreased risk for GA (−20% and 29%, respectively). Higher adherence to the Med diet was associated with a lower risk of nvAge related macular degeneration (AMD) only when comparison was made between the highest tertile versus the lowest (T3 vs. T1, −16%). It is important to note that the article by Keenan et al. used strong statistical methods. Indeed, they stated that the proportional hazards assumption pertaining to the multivariate proportional hazards regression was tested in all cases, and when not met (in only one case), stratified proportional hazards regression was performed instead. In addition, they performed sensitivity analyses regarding the relationship between the aMED score, which they modified compared to the original one (see above), and the risk of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) progression by swapping their score for the classical aMED score.",f69aebd1-b03c-4af4-899d-c67db64144d7
51,methods52," This resulted in similar outcomes, although the patterns of association were partially attenuated, and according to the authors this might have been due to loss of information caused by binary assignment above or below the median using the original aMED score [44]. Keenan et al. also analysed Med diet food groups in relation to Age related macular degeneration (AMD) and showed that higher fish consumption (Q4 vs. Q1) in Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) diminished the risk of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) progression by 31%. Furthermore, progression to large drusen, a risk factor for advanced Age related macular degeneration (AMD), was evaluated in separate analyses, which indicated that higher aMED (T3 vs. T1) decreased the odds by 21%. In the paper by Merle et al. from 2020 [50], the Med diet is evaluated in relation to drusen size progression rather than Age related macular degeneration (AMD) progression.",9cd354c8-42dd-4e40-81fe-5fac51820d94
52,methods53," We decided to include this article in our systematic review because drusen are the major hallmark of Age related macular degeneration (AMD), and even though information are scarce about the factors influencing their progression, it is known that early Age related macular degeneration (AMD) presenting drusen increases the risk of developing more advance disease [50,61,62]. The definition of drusen progression is reported in the legend of Table 1. In this prospective study within the Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a medium/high adherence to the Med diet as assessed by the aMED lowered the risk of drusen progression by 17% compared to low adherence (score 4–9 vs. 0–3, Table 1).  4. Discussion  In this systematic review, eight articles investigating the relationship between the adherence to the Mediterranean eating pattern and onset/progression of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) were analysed.",2360c6ac-10ab-4317-affa-ff804581e980
53,methods54," These studies included a total of 26,056 people, and analysed more than 11,327 outcomes, represented either by new Age related macular degeneration (AMD) cases or cases in which the disease progressed from earlier to later stages. They demonstrated that higher adherence to the Med diet was associated with a decreased risk of developing Age related macular degeneration (AMD), and with lowered odds of progression to more advanced forms. Since similar associations found in studies with different populations support a robust link between a certain outcome and the chosen exposure, our review shows a clear beneficial effect of a predominantly plant-based eating pattern on Age related macular degeneration (AMD) risk, both from a preventative and an interventional point of view.",17e2d1c5-1828-4c9d-80c6-bb040c80cc40
54,methods55," The pathogenesis of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is complex, being multifactorial, and involves several mechanisms such as endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress, processes common in other degenerative disease [63]. For this reason, the exploration of how a diet centred on foods rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory molecules, such as the Med diet, affect Age related macular degeneration (AMD) onset and development is justified by biological plausibility. Despite the high quality of the studies, some limitations are present. Firstly, as demonstrated by Keenan et al. with their sensitivity analysis [44], the binary system used for assigning points in the assessment of the adherence to the Med diet can be limiting, and a more stratified version could better represent a complex behaviour such as eating, and highlight subtle differences that might have an impact on disease outcomes.",5244b716-cf48-4747-9cd2-3ca6bb03d1c1
55,methods56," Furthermore, different studies adjusted their model for different variables, which might increase the risk of residual confounding, even though all of them made adjustments for at least age, sex (except for Mares et al. in which participants consisted of females only), and smoking, which are the most important confounders. In addition, two out of eight studies were cross-sectional [36,45], and two were case-control studies [46,47], which are more prone to recall and selection biases. It also is worth remembering the genetics play a role in Age related macular degeneration (AMD) pathogenesis, and that interactions between certain SNPs and diet might play a large role in determining disease onset and/or progression, as shown by some of the studies analysed here.",ab518926-2de5-4e63-971b-0dbe4b60dcc6
56,methods57,"  Nonetheless, the result of our systematic review is important because there are currently no efficient treatments for curing Age related macular degeneration (AMD), most notably the GA form, and preventative measures for delaying its onset, in association with interventional strategies aimed at slowing its advancement, are of pivotal significance. This is also true in light of the fact that in recent years, diets emphasising the consumption of plant-derived food groups, and advocating for the reduction in animal-based products, the so-called flexitarian diets, have become more popular. Consequently, a greater number of people might be adhering, or will adhere, to “newer” dietary patterns similar to the more established Med diet, with consequences that are currently unknown concerning general eye health, and particularly Age related macular degeneration (AMD) risk.",39f864e3-443d-4c4c-9092-24b88d41a0ad
57,methods58," This may warrant the execution of future studies similar to those presented here, in order to assess the association between these increasingly widespread eating behaviours and a disease with a profound effect on the physical and psychological wellbeing of people.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review evaluating the relationship between the Med diet, a dietary pattern extensively studied for its potential beneficial health effects owing to its high content of plant foods, and Age related macular degeneration (AMD). Here, through a thorough selection of the literature, we identified high quality studies demonstrating that higher adherence to the Mediterranean-style eating pattern can delay the onset and progression of Age related macular degeneration (AMD).",c30fdee2-b6d9-4ced-9fce-5b6a40d09ea5
58,methods59," Although further studies might be needed, our findings may encourage the development and implementation of lifestyle-modifying strategies aimed at reducing the risk of Age related macular degeneration (AMD) onset and progression.
