Search strategy  A search of PubMed Central (PubMed Central (PMC)), Cochrane Library and Mediterranean style (MED)LINE (EBSCO) was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines . The search strategy was created and implemented from the population, exposure, outcome (population exposure outcome (PEO)) framework, detailed in Table 1, to extract the most up to date studies between 01/01/2010 to 01/08/2021. The main search terms included “overweight”, “obese”, “adult”, “Mediterranean style diet”, “body mass index” and “inflammatory”.",389b0d55-d4db-4f11-9963-0649198079c5

Identified studies were exported into “Endnote” bibliography software (version X9, Thomson Reuters, New York) for collation and refinement. To further minimise effects of publication bias, a snowball method, characterised by manual checking of references from retrieved articles, was applied to ensure complete collection. Publication alerts were set to identify any studies published after the date of the literature search.  Table 1.

34,results0," Selection process  Figure 1 displays the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) flow chart of the study selection process. The systematic database search located 65 studies, fourteen from PubMed, 27 from Cochrane Library and 24 from Mediterranean style (MED)LINE. Once duplicates had been removed, 48 studies remained eligible for screening, fifteen studies were then excluded based on their title and/or abstract, due to the lack of relevance to the inclusion criteria. A further 27 studies were excluded on the basis that one or more of the following applied: (1) full-text accessibility was not available (2) there was no inclusion of baseline and/or endpoint quantitative measures of Body Mass Index (BMI) and/or inflammatory markers (3) the study included the implementation of other non-dietary interventions (e.g., physical activity programs) (4) the study was active.

The risk of bias assessment for each study is presented in Table 6 and Table 5 provides a summary of diet interventions. Three studies were carried out in Italy (Luisi et al., 2019; Perticone et al., 2019; Sofi et al., 2018), one in the U.S.A (Stendell-Hollis et al., 2013), one in Spain (Marques-Rocha et al., 2016) and one in Brazil .",a26ba494-2c24-4b2d-97ac-4b0e5a0e52a2
36,results2," Out of the six eligible studies, two included a standard MD intervention, four introduced a variation of the MD, four were hypocaloric MD and one enriched with 40 g/day High Quality-Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Luisi et al. (2019) was the only study (n = 36) that included a normal weight control group (Body Mass Index (BMI) 18.5–24.9 kg/m2, n = 18) against overweight/obese participants (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2, n = 18) of which a similar metabolic health profile was reported between both study groups, yet slightly increased amongst cases. The control group received a typical MD in the absence of calorie restriction, and cases received a low-calorie |MD (1552 ± 160 kcal/day).  Four studies involved two study arms with comparison interventions, including the MyPyramid (MP) diet for Pregnancy and Lactation (Stendell-Hollis et al., 2013), a low-calorie vegetarian diet (Low Calorie Vegetarian diet (Lcardiovascular disease (CVD))) (Sofi et al.",b4c7377b-7b0d-4699-9439-7f75be538b0b

Marques-Rocha et al. (2016) conducted an 8-week hypocaloric controlled intervention study, based on the reduction of metabolic syndrome in Navarra, Spain diet (reduction of metabolic syndrome in Navarra Spain diet (RESMENA)), with no inclusion of control groups or study arms. All participants taking part in a MD intervention had a mean baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m2, varying from 26.5 kg/m2 to 38.8 kg/m2. The included studies used varying durations, from eight weeks (Marques-Rocha et al., 2016), 3 months (Luisi et al., 2019; Sofi et al., 2018; Thomazella et al., 2011), four months (Stendell-Hollis et al., 2013) to 12 months .",adb7b0d8-1d8e-4853-b676-602884e3d565
38,results4,"  Mediterranean style diets  A complete summary of diet interventions and measures of dietary adherence is presented in Table 5. Two studies included a standard MD intervention, but both reported as hypocaloric by nature at follow up (Stendell-Hollis et al., 2013; Thomazella et al., 2011). In comparison, four (Luisi et al., 2019; Marques-Rocha et al., 2016; Perticone et al., 2019; Sofi et al., 2018) of the studies introduced a variation of the MD, all were hypocaloric and one  enriched with 40 g/day High Quality-Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The similarities amongst all MD interventions included the consumption of whole grains, fruit and vegetables, fish, nuts, olive oil, legumes and poultry. As displayed in Table 5, macronutrient requirements varied, but remained in similar margins to each other. Overall, one study did not report any data on macronutrient intake (Stendell-Hollis et al., 2013).",4d7208cc-d0b0-4d90-b8ce-1b4e4fa90ebb

Risk of bias assessment  The risk of bias assessment scores are presented in Table 6. All studies included in the current review received a positive ( + ) rating, indicating that the majority of validity questions were answered as “YES” out of maximum 10. In total, two studies scored 10/10 (Stendell-Hollis et al., 2013; Thomazella et al., 2011), two studies scored 9/10 , one scored 8/10  and one study scored 7/10 (Marques-Rocha et al., 2016). Marques-Rocha et al. (2016) received the lowest rating of 7 total “YES” due to the lack of blinding and limited description of subject withdrawal handling. However, question 3 was excluded due to lack of relevance, resulting in the lowest score.",2cb5ac14-39b6-4c25-b6fc-cc3003e3391a
40,results6,"  Effects of the Mediterranean diet on Body Mass Index (BMI)  Out of the six eligible studies, reductions in Body Mass Index (BMI) measurement at follow up were consistent after consuming a MD, five of which were significant (Table 4). Significant reductions in Body Mass Index (BMI) (P < 0.05) were reported amongst all participants whose mean Body Mass Index (BMI) fell within the range of 30.2 kg/m2 to 35.4 kg/m2, however a non-significant reduction was reported for participants with a mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of 38.8 kg/m2. All overweight participants, with mean Body Mass Index (BMI) ranging from 26.5 kg/m2 to 27.1 kg/m2, reported significant reductions (P < 0.001). Stendell-Hollis et al. (2013) showed reductions in mean Body Mass Index (BMI) to be significant (P < 0.001) at 4 months follow up (27.1 ± 5.29 to 26.2 ± 5.58 ( − 0.85 ± 1.24)) as well as in the comparative MP diet group (26.7 ± 4.82 to 25.6 ± 5.24 ( − 1.13 ± 1.22)). Likewise, Marques-Rocha et al.",c819064b-1a9a-4b4e-bb87-7d8f5677f54a
41,results7," (2016) showed a significant reduction (P < 0.01) in Body Mass Index (BMI) across participants who consumed the calorie restricted reduction of metabolic syndrome in Navarra Spain diet (RESMENA) diet at the 8 weeks follow up (35.4 ± 4.4 to 32.8 ± 4.2). When compared with a hypocaloric MD, Sofi et al. (2018) reported greater reductions in Body Mass Index (BMI) in the Low Calorie Vegetarian diet (Lcardiovascular disease (CVD)) group ( − 0.67kg/m2 and − 0.64kg/m2) but both interventions generated significant reductions for Body Mass Index (BMI) for obese participants (P < 0.05). Likewise, Luisi et al. (2019) reported significant reductions in mean Body Mass Index (BMI) for overweight/obese controls (P < 0.01) at the three months follow up (30.2 ± 1.0 to 28.8 ± 0.9) and remained statistically significant (P < 0.05) when compared to normal weight controls (21.6 ± 0.6 to 21.7 ± 0.6).

In contrast, Perticone et al. (2019) showed no significant reductions in Body Mass Index (BMI) measurement from the standard hypocaloric MD (38.8 ± 4.5 to 36.1 ± 5.7).  Effects of the Mediterranean diet on inflammatory markers  The baseline and endpoint inflammatory markers are presented in Table 4. Consumption of a MD showed reductions in hs-C reactive Protein (CRP) in two studies. Perticone et al. (2019) showed significant reductions (P = 0.044) in hs-C reactive Protein (CRP) (mg/L) after twelve months in participants who consumed the standard hypocaloric MD (5.6 ± 4.3 to 3.7 ± 1.2) as well as significant reductions (P < 0.0001) in the Very low calorie (<800 kcal per day) ketogenic diet (VLCKD) (4.5 ± 2.6 to 1.8 ± 0.8).

43,discussion0," Effects of Mediterranean diet on Body Mass Index (BMI)  This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of consuming a MD on the Body Mass Index (BMI) of overweight/obese adults to ascertain its potential as a COVID-19 mitigation strategy. Body Mass Index (BMI) reductions amongst MD groups appear similar, to those from comparative dietary interventions amongst overweight/obese adults. Results confirm reductions in mean Body Mass Index (BMI) post- MD intervention, including studies without intentional calorie restriction. As reported by Thomazella et al. (2011) mean calorie intake in the standard MD group showed a total reduction of −464 kcal/day at three months follow up, which likely to contributed to the significant Body Mass Index (BMI) reduction of −0.6 kg/m2 . Similar calorie reductions were reported in the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes Diet (TLCD) group (−478 kcal/day) with identical reductions in Body Mass Index (BMI) (–0.6 kg/m2).",d882ccc7-d17b-4ccd-9265-ad1fc0455dc5
44,discussion1," With similarities between diets, the interventions differentiate by placing emphasis on overall fat intake reduction, alcohol avoidance and daily consumption of soluble fibre-rich foods in the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes Diet (TLCD), allowing lower calorie intake via restriction and satiation from fibre-rich foods . Conclusions support findings from D’Innocenzo et al. (2019) whereby adherence to a fibre-dense, MD based on plant-based, energy-low foods has more favourable effects on reducing Body Mass Index (BMI) as opposed to a western diet that is higher in saturated fat, alcohol consumption and lower in fruit and vegetable consumption (Kopp, 2019).  Similar results were shown by Stendell-Hollis et al. (2013), whereby overweight, postpartum/breastfeeding women who consumed a standard MD showed significant decreases in calorie intake after four months ( − 251.2 kcal/day, p = 0.045), this was also reported in the MP group ( − 437.5 kcal/day; P = 0.035).",af7b1d64-ef18-4207-ad53-fea71a39d74c
45,discussion2," It is possible that the deemphasis on fat intake, specifically from nuts and olive oil, could be causal for these greater calorie reductions in the MP group, which was introduced to differentiate the MP diet from the MD. The reduction in fat intake also provides a likely explanation for greater loss in Body Mass Index (BMI) (−1.1 kg/m2) compared to the MD group (−0.9 kg/m2). However, the added energy requirements of lactation could account for the Body Mass Index (BMI) reductions, whereby women who breastfeed can require 500 additional kcal/day beyond what is recommended for non-pregnant women (Kominiarek and Rajan, 2016). Therefore, increased energy demands throughout lactation may have aided towards the total reductions seen similarly in each study group, whereby a total 0.5–1.0 kg/month can be lost after the first postpartum month (Kominiarek and Rajan, 2016).",990a30a1-9356-4c8d-833a-8aa42cd8ceba
46,discussion3,"  Studies that intervened with a hypocaloric/low-calorie MD diet all showed Body Mass Index (BMI) reductions, majority significant, amongst overweight and obese adults. Sofi et al. (2018) reported similar reductions in Body Mass Index (BMI) in the low-calorie MD group ( − 0.64 kg/m2) and the Low Calorie Vegetarian diet (Lcardiovascular disease (CVD)) group ( − 0.67 kg/m2) amongst obese adults. Despite greater reductions in the Low Calorie Vegetarian diet (Lcardiovascular disease (CVD)) group, it is indicated that close reductions between groups may be related to higher intakes of fibre-dense food groups such as complex carbohydrates, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, aiding weight loss via satiety, fat reduction and glucose absorption (Lattimer and Haub, 2010; Sofi et al., 2018).",7b1f100c-1d8c-4c0a-90da-4bd14710b02d
47,discussion4," Although the intervention diets did not differ in the percentage of calories obtained from macronutrients and the main categories of food, the Low Calorie Vegetarian diet (Lcardiovascular disease (CVD)) group were restricted from consuming any animal products. Therefore, the possibility of a greater reduction in calorie consumption in the Low Calorie Vegetarian diet (Lcardiovascular disease (CVD)) cannot be excluded. Despite similar reductions, the total absence of these food items combined with a substitutional increase in fibre-dense foods, from vegetables and wholegrains, in the Low Calorie Vegetarian diet (Lcardiovascular disease (CVD)) would have likely caused a greater caloric deficit in comparison to the MD group, likely accounting for greater Body Mass Index (BMI) reduction (Najjar and Feresin, 2019).  This is further supported by Luisi et al. (2019) who reported significant reductions amongst overweight/obese participants intervened with a low-calorie MD for 3 months.",787a3e95-d14a-4043-8f73-085a438f9859
48,discussion5," In comparison to normal weight controls (Body Mass Index (BMI) 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), participants restricted their caloric intake to 1552 ± 160 kcal/day. Despite duplicate macronutrient requirements reductions in Body Mass Index (BMI) were only reported amongst overweight/obese participants after three months, whereby mean Body Mass Index (BMI) amongst controls had a non-significant increase of + 0.1 kg/m2. These findings support that a hypocaloric |MD (1552 ± 160 kcal/day) can provide favourable, short-term impacts on Body Mass Index (BMI) amongst overweight and/or obese adults. However, it has been shown that significant Body Mass Index (BMI) reductions may yield from even shorter intervention durations (>8 weeks) as concluded by Marques-Rocha et al. (2016) whereby obese participants achieved a Body Mass Index (BMI) loss of −2.6 kg/m2of after only 8-weeks of a hypocaloric MD intervention.  Similar conclusions can be made from Perticone et al. (2019).",38fb1ab7-f1cb-4ba1-8bf8-d509ef634484
49,discussion6," Despite no significance, greater reductions in mean Body Mass Index (BMI) were reported in the Very low calorie (<800 kcal per day) ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group in comparison to the standard hypocaloric Mediterranean diet (Standard hypocaloric Mediterranean diet (SHMD)) at 12 months follow-up. Caloric requirements between intervention groups varied, whereby obese participants in the Very low calorie (<800 kcal per day) ketogenic diet (VLCKD) consumed no greater than 800 kcal/day for 12 months. The Very low calorie (<800 kcal per day) ketogenic diet (VLCKD) supports the reduction of total intake of both carbohydrates and lipids, whereby a calorie restriction of <800 kcal per day has been used as an effective regimen for weight loss. The ketone bodies produced in a ketogenic state are utilised to suppress appetite, allowing a minimal calorie intake .",9b7058a3-1cf5-42d7-b743-db47c291bf83
50,discussion7," Participants in the Very low calorie (<800 kcal per day) ketogenic diet (VLCKD) were also recommended 0.8–1.5 g of protein/kg of adequate body weight, allowing the satiation effects to yield greater potential weight loss and improve adherence. Comparatively, participants in the Standard hypocaloric Mediterranean diet (SHMD) maintained a 500 kcal/day caloric deficit, whereby macronutrient advisories compared to those in the Very low calorie (<800 kcal per day) ketogenic diet (VLCKD), allowing greater amounts of energy to be derived from carbohydrates and fats, and less from proteins whereby adherence was much lower than stated in the Very low calorie (<800 kcal per day) ketogenic diet (VLCKD). These findings challenge conclusions made by Mancini et al. (2016) surrounding the hypothesis that there are “no optimal macronutrient composition for achieving sustained weight loss”, whereby macronutrient variations that advocate ketosis could optimise long-term weight reductions.",d05d5e5c-060c-4a65-a9d3-f7ffd7c57643
51,discussion8," Despite the likelihood of greater Body Mass Index (BMI) reduction to be a product of heterogeneity surrounding calorie intake, sustained weight loss through ketogenic macronutrient variations in parallel with MD principles could surround potential future research for longer-term (>4 month) obesity mitigation .  Effects of Mediterranean diet on inflammatory markers  The current review aimed to investigate the effects of consuming a MD on the inflammatory markers of overweight/obese adults, whereby the inclusion of plant-derived nutritional components remain integral in providing bioactive compounds. These compounds present health-promoting effects due to their anti-inflammatory properties, whereby exaggerated inflammatory response has been linked with COVID-19 severe illness .",acbc6807-2846-4e4d-b9a6-0d3397ee1301
52,discussion9," Findings from the current review remain in support of this, whereby inflammatory markers seen elevated in COVID-19 severity, have been significantly reduced after dietary interventions surrounding MD constituents.  Results demonstrate that TNF-α, seen elevated in severe COVID-19 cases, have been significantly reduced (P = 0.021; P < 0.001) over a 3–4-month MD intervention for overweight/obese adults (Luisi et al., 2019; Stendell-Hollis et al., 2013). Findings from Stendell-Hollis et al. (2013) highlight the inflammatory-modulating effect of short-term MD and MP diets (4 months) on overweight adults, whereby participants in both groups showed significant reductions (P = 0.021). The deemphasis on fat intake, specifically from nuts and olive oil, was placed on the MP group to differentiate the MP diet from the MD.",c3818f50-6b3f-4755-a179-c6fb0bcb3ec9
53,discussion10," However, there remained similarities amongst diets including predominant intakes of foods containing; alpha-linolenic acid, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, fibre, and antioxidants which support findings of potential inflammatory modifying effects resultant from MD dietary constituents (Ajani et al., 2004; Mori et al., 2003; Paschos et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004). It is possible that the lesser significance in TNF-α reductions reported in the MD group could be resultant from the lack of adherence to the dietary behavioural targets reported and could therefore add to the absence of statistically significant differences in inflammation between diet groups (Stendell-Hollis et al., 2013). Supporting these conclusions, Luisi et al.",be10f1cc-8ef6-4122-8961-b4aeb7d00ade
54,discussion11," (2019) reported the likely cause of significant reduction in inflammatory markers, TNF-α and IL-6, after MD interventions was the protective role provided by polyphenols when supplementing with 40g of high-quality extra virgin olive oil (HQ-EVOO) per day, of which benefits have been strongly depicted in previous studies . Similar significant reductions in these inflammatory markers were also reported amongst the normal weight controls who received a duplicate supplementation of HQ-EVOO, further supporting its dietary protective roles in modifying inflammation for future interventions amongst those at risk of severe COVID-19.  In support of these findings, Sofi et al. (2018) also reported reductions in TNF-α in the low calorie Mediterranean diet (low calorie Mediterranean diet (LCMD)) group in contrast to non-significant increases in the Low Calorie Vegetarian diet (Lcardiovascular disease (CVD)) group. In support of Al-Daghri et al.",c3cbadc4-0a73-4ca1-a30d-6e55facaac94
55,discussion12," (2016) associations have been shown between circulating vitamin B12 concentrations with inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α in adults, highlighting a potential association between vitamin B12 deficiency with elevated TNF-α levels (Miller, 2002). It is likely that a vegetarian diet, that often excludes sources of vitamin B12 , may heighten the risk of elevated TNF-α in this circumstance. However, it can be shown that short-term (>4 months) significant reductions in TNF-α are achievable in adherence to a MD that incorporates high polyphenol foods such as HQ-EVOO. HQ-EVOO, which is one of the fundamental foods of MD, is rich in monounsaturated oleic acid which poses impressive anti-inflammatory properties (Medeiros-de-Moraes et al., 2018).",10b10244-5613-4047-a9dd-135a9ead2ec7
56,discussion13," In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, further research is needed to evaluate the effects of vitamin B12 supplementation in adherence to vegetarian/vegan diets and its potential to maximise inflammatory reduction in overweight/obese adults.  Regarding hs-C reactive Protein (CRP), our findings highlight short-term (3 months) and longer-term (12 months) reductions in hs-C reactive Protein (CRP) levels amongst overweight/obese adults who consumed a MD. Perticone et al. (2019) reported significant reductions in hs-C reactive Protein (CRP) after twelve months in Standard hypocaloric Mediterranean diet (SHMD) and Very low calorie (<800 kcal per day) ketogenic diet (VLCKD) intervention groups, however reductions were greater and more significant in the Very low calorie (<800 kcal per day) ketogenic diet (VLCKD). Due to the associated correlations with Body Mass Index (BMI) reduction, findings add to those reported by Merra et al.",abb0e49e-ef41-4f80-9bfe-150f4aa2f5a9
57,discussion14," (2017) whereby adherence to a short term (3-weeks) very low-calorie ketogenic diet (450–700 kcal/day) remained parallel to a reduction in Body Mass Index (BMI) (p = 0.001) and the inflammatory marker, C reactive Protein (CRP) (p = 0.02) amongst adults with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m2, confirming the potential effectiveness of a Very low calorie (<800 kcal per day) ketogenic diet (VLCKD) for risk markers of COVID-19 severity.  Regarding IL-6, short-term (3–4 months) reductions were reported amongst participants who consumed a MD, however, increases in IL-6 were reported amongst those who consumed a Low Calorie Vegetarian diet (Lcardiovascular disease (CVD)). Both study groups achieved significant reductions in Body Mass Index (BMI), however the unparallel link between IL-6 and Body Mass Index (BMI) in the Low Calorie Vegetarian diet (Lcardiovascular disease (CVD)) raises questions for recent conclusions devised by Jaceldo-Siegl et al.",7598960b-65cc-4888-ab42-9acde6f97db4
58,discussion15," (2018), whereby lower IL-6 concentrations among vegetarians remained associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) amongst overweight adult participants. Therefore, it may be concluded that a longer intervention is required to assess the association between a Low Calorie Vegetarian diet (Lcardiovascular disease (CVD)) diet and IL-6, or findings could instead add to those from Samavat et al. (2018) whereby low vitamin B12 conditions, commonly presented in the presence of vegetarian diets, have aligned significantly with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) . Although not significant, Stendell-Hollis et al. (2013) reported reductions in IL-6 amongst those who consumed the MD and MP diet at 4-months follow up. Participants in both groups also achieved significant reductions in Body Mass Index (BMI), which in turn would reflect recent findings from El-Mikkawy et al.",43095d9b-04b6-4c90-90a9-d0e0ae96306e

Study strengths and limitations  Strengths are in line with the current review. The conclusions drawn from findings offer plausibility and importance surrounding potential dietary interventions for measures that are parallel to COVID-19 severity. The eligibility formation and data collection allow focus to be placed on the determinants of COVID-19 outcomes, with intent to deduct bias and create a strong foreground for future research into potential disease severity mitigation, through Body Mass Index (BMI) reduction and modification of inflammatory markers. Limitations surrounding the current study should however also be noted.

60,discussion17," When analysing the study findings, it is important to be vigilant of the potential heterogeneity in outcome data resultant from the post-natal/breast feeding participant markers included, as underlying factors may cause discrepancies in interpretations. In addition, although the included studies adhere to participant eligibility and intervention outcomes, the limited attribution of randomisation amongst studies could create significant impediment through application of findings. Three out of six studies included randomisation in the intervention method, indicating that the elimination of bias amongst studies remains inconsistent and should be considered when analysing study findings. It is also essential to consider that short, 8-week intervention periods may enable misinterpretations in the potential MD intervention effectiveness.",72d61f7f-4ff3-4737-87fd-dfdcceb53921

One study also did not report data on dietary adherence enabling misinterpretations of low-calorie MD intervention effectiveness for overweight and obese adults . It is therefore essential to highlight the necessity for further research into various dietary patterns in line with the direct severity measures of COVID-19.",03244fd1-4036-4269-90cd-973495768904
62,discussion19," A further systematic review/meta-analysis of COVID severity outcomes and dietary patterns should be considered as emerging evidence continues to become available in the future .  Conclusions  To conclude, the results from this systematic review indicate that a hypocaloric, fibre-dense MD is an effective, short term (<4 months) mitigation strategy to significantly reduce Body Mass Index (BMI) amongst overweight/obese adults who may be at a heightened risk of developing severe COVID-19 outcomes. High intakes of bioactive compounds, in line with MD adherence, have proven integral for their inflammation reducing benefits reported amongst overweight/obese adults, whereby the inclusion of HQ-EVOO alongside Body Mass Index (BMI) reduction can maximise short-term potential. Our findings show a hypocaloric, fibre and protein dense MD that adheres towards restricted alcohol and saturated fat intake could provide sustained reductions in Body Mass Index (BMI) (>4 months).",f0b5c078-5784-4813-b72d-def3fd308eec
63,discussion20," Following ketogenic macronutrient recommendations (55% to 60% fat, 30% to 35% protein, and 5% to 10% carbohydrates) may further reinforce Body Mass Index (BMI) reduction potential via appetite suppression and satiety amongst overweight/obese adults . The inclusion of polyphenol-dense foods, such as HQ-EVOO, in combination with a hypocaloric MD may also present favourable outcomes on inflammatory markers. These approaches could therefore be considered for future research into longer term interventions to tackle obesity and inflammatory regulation to help mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
