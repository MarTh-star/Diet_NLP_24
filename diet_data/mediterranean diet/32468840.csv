0,methods0," We retrospectively retrieved information on children’s behavior before and three to five weeks after the implementation of lockdown in an uncontrolled study group. We included children younger than 17 years who lived in Catalonia during the nationwide implementation of lockdown in Spain.  An online structured survey in Spanish was distributed through a convenience sampling strategy between 7–18 April 2020 to parents or responsible caretakers through networks of student parents’ associations (‘Asociaciones de madres y padres de alumnus’, AMPA) and social media platforms. Informed consent was obtained from responsible adults who voluntarily and anonymously answered the questionnaire on behalf of all children living in their household. Each respondent was also encouraged to send the survey to other potential participants in their network. At least five AMPA from private and public institutions were contacted during the recruitment process (~400 students each).",409cc65c-bd95-410d-8733-12a8d8a4710a
1,methods1," Details on the survey questionnaire are included in Supplementary Materials.  We received information from 4730 children across Spain, from which 26 questionnaires were discarded as duplicates. We only included children living in the Catalonia region in this study (n = 3464), which includes the provinces of Barcelona, Girona, Tarragona, and Lleida. Children living in other regions of Spain (n = 1235) or with missing information on their province of residence (n = 5) were not included in the analysis. The overall response rate was 73%. Characteristics of children included and excluded from this study are shown in Supplementary Table S1.  2.1. Data Collection  The survey questionnaire was designed by pediatricians from Hospital HM Nens, HM Hospitales, and approved by the IRB Committee.",51ba60ed-eae6-4e66-b526-0f7db4efd785
2,methods2, The questionnaire consisted of three sections adapted from standardized questionnaires that aimed to examine: (i) adherence to Mediterranean diet (adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD)) after the implementation of lockdown; (ii) sleeping habits after the implementation of lockdown; and (iii) PA frequency and time spent in front of screens (TV or any other electronic devices) before and after the implementation of lockdown. Information on adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD) and sleeping habits were only asked after the implementation of lockdown to reduce recall bias and to avoid an extensive questionnaire [7]. Information previous to the lockdown was asked as the usual habit of the child during a ‘normal’ week or day in child’s life.,2f680437-52bd-4d6a-bbc0-f954c802d050
3,methods3," As many families and children could have change habits even several days or weeks before the implementation of lockdown due to fear or concerns about the viral spread, we avoided specifying any number of days/weeks before lockdown in the wording of the questions on usual routines.  We also collected demographic characteristics of children such as gender, age range, province of residence, and the number of days after lockdown children had spent by the time of responding to the survey.  2.2. Adherence to Mediterranean Diet  Adherence to Mediterranean diet (adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD)) was assessed through the Mediterranean diet quality index for children and adolescents (KIDMED score). Details on how the score was calculated are described elsewhere [8]. KIDMED scores range from −4 to 12 points, where higher values denote higher adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD).",2db0568b-fd3b-4674-9b51-0370a0e2a185
4,methods4," Score values can then be categorized into: (i) high or optimum adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD) (KIDMED 8 to 12); (ii) medium adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD) (KIDMED 4 to 7); and (iii) low adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD) (KIDMED equal or less than 3 points). In our study, we considered both KIDMED score and categories of adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD) for describing dietary habits after the implementation of lockdown.  2.3. Sleeping Habits  Our survey included a set of questions for detecting disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS)) extracted from the sleep disturbance scale for children (sleep disturbance scale for children (SDSC)) [9]. Characteristics of the sleep disturbance scale for children (SDSC) are detailed elsewhere [9].",a8d573d0-0ac6-4428-b0ee-b4d889c79ddc
5,methods5," The disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS) assessment independently evaluates sleeping disorders related to bedtime resistance, night awakenings, sleep duration, and sleep latency. Scores range from 7 to 35, with values above 16 suggesting disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep. The item in the disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS) domain assessing sleeping hours (“How many hours of sleep does your child get on most nights”) was used also as a separate question. Answers to this question were then categorized into ‘adequate’ (≥9 h/night for children <11 years, and ≥8 h/night for children ≥11 years) or ‘inadequate’ sleep [10]. Additionally, we included a question assessing the delay in bedtime after lockdown (“After lockdown, does your child go to sleep later than prior to lockdown?”).  2.4.",462ff011-61e1-474d-80de-49aec720216e
6,methods6," Physical Activity  PA was assessed with two questions that compared after-school PA before lockdown and leisure PA after the implementation of lockdown (“Under normal conditions (without lockdown), how many days a week does your child engage in physical activity outside of school?”; “During lockdown, how many days a week does your child exercise between 30 and 60 min a day?”). These questions were designed based on WHO recommendations, and we considered adequate frequency of PA when children performed PA for one or more hours per day, for at least 5 days in a week [11]. Three additional questions assessed whether leisure PA after lockdown was performed with relatives or alone (“During lockdown, how many days a week does your child exercise alone?” and “During lockdown, how many days a week does your child exercise with other family members?”), and the kind of leisure PA performed after lockdown (“Indicate the sport (s) that your child does during lockdown”).  2.5.",441ba36e-8f42-414c-b2dc-05a19673ea8d
7,methods7," Time Spent on TV and Electronic Devices  Two questions compared the number of days children spent more than two hours/day either watching TV or using electronic devices for entertainment purposes in a week, before and after the lockdown (“Under normal conditions (without lockdown), how many days a week does your child use television, computer (not academic) or mobile for more than 2 h a day?”; “During lockdown, how many days a week does your child use television, computer (not academic) or mobile phone for more than 2 h in a day”). We considered inadequate frequency in use of TV-ED when children spent more than 2 h per day either watching TV or using electronic devices for more than 2 days a week [11].  2.6. Statistical Analysis  We described demographic characteristics of participants, and adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD) and sleeping habits after the implementation of lockdown by gender and age range.",717e4aaf-f2f1-4206-9d70-78b8c1cdb12a
8,methods8," We also showed changes in the frequency of PA and TV-ED use before and after the implementation of lockdown in the overall study population.  We examined changes in the odds of inadequate frequency of PA and TV-ED use among children before and after the lockdown by using generalized estimating equation models (generalized estimating equation models (GEE)) with empirical standard errors. generalized estimating equation models (GEE) allows estimating the population-averaged probability of inadequate frequency of PA and TV-ED use, while accounting for within-children correlations across measures over time [12]. We also examined whether outcome differences varied by gender and age range by testing interactions. We used Statistical Package for Social Science SPSS 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) for descriptive analysis and SAS9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) for the generalized estimating equation models (GEE) models.  3. Results  A total of 3464 children were included, of whom 37.",5915ba5e-ad85-438a-9305-4137348e101d
9,methods9,"3% were under 6 years of age, and 36.5% and 26.2% were between 6–10 and 11–16 years, respectively (Table 1). Boys and girls were almost equally distributed. The average amount of days that children stayed at home by the time of the survey was 26.8 days. Most of participants (90.2%) were from the Barcelona province (Table 1).  Based on responses provided by parents, the mean KIDMED score in the overall population was 7.5 (Table 2), and the score was significantly higher among children under 6 years of age (Table 3), with no differences among boys and girls (Table 2). Approximately half of the participants (53.2%) showed optimal adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD), with no differences across gender (Table 2). Optimal adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD) was higher among children under 6 years of age (Table 3). A summary of the responses to KIDMED questionnaire is presented in Supplementary Table S2.",6e345c13-ac07-49dc-8002-967989265774
10,methods10,"  After the implementation of lockdown, most children aged 6–10 and 11–16 showed a delay in their bedtime (84% and 88.2%, respectively) (Table 3). Parents reported that almost 20% of the children showed inadequate hours of sleep, being it more frequent among children aged 6–10 (28.5%), without differences by gender (Table 3). Children under 6 years of age had a higher disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS) score and were more frequently suspected of disorders in initiating and maintaining sleep (Table 3).  Before lockdown, more than 50% of children did PA after school for at least one hour per day for three or more days per week (Figure 1), and 19% of children met the requirements for adequate PA (at least one hour of PA per day for more than 4 days per week). After the implementation of lockdown, almost 70% of children reported not doing a minimum of an hour of PA on any day of the week, and only 10.3% reported an adequate frequency of PA (Figure 1).",b9dc8955-1ad0-4a36-97e5-943da912a8fd
11,methods11," Characteristics and mode of PA performed after lockdown based on parent’s responses are described in Supplementary Figures S1–S4.  Before lockdown, almost 75% of children used TV-ED (non-academic) for more than two hours on less than three days a week, approaching to the recommendations of adequate frequency of TV-ED use (Figure 2). After lockdown, around 75% of children used TV-ED for more than two hours on three or more days per week (Figure 2). A third of participants performed PA guided by screens, given the information provided by parents (Supplementary Figure S4).  The odds of inadequate frequency of PA after lockdown was twice as likely compared to the odds before lockdown (OR 2.0 95% CI 1.8 to 2.6). The odds ratio of inadequate frequency of PA was greater among boys, and it increased with age for both gender (Table 4). Among boys aged 11–16, for example, the odds of the inadequate frequency of PA after lockdown was five times as likely, as compared to before lockdown (OR 5.",507a354d-f53e-4d3a-8a45-374580349436
12,methods12,"0 95% CI 3.3 to 7.6), while among girls of same age, the odds of the inadequate frequency of PA after lockdown was 2.4 times as likely, as compared to before lockdown (OR 2.4 95% CI 1.7 to 3.4) (Table 4).  In the overall sample, the odds of the inadequate frequency of TV-ED use after lockdown was nine times as likely, as compared to before lockdown (OR 9.2 95% CI 8.4 to 10.1). The OR of the inadequate frequency of TV-ED use was greater among boys (Table 5) and among children aged 6–10.  Sensitivity analysis restricting the sample to singleton children did not show significant differences in the OR of either the inadequate frequency of PA or in the use of TV-ED.  4. Discussion  Our study showed that adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD) was optimal in half of the study population, with worse adherence among children older than 6 years of age.",3ff05fd6-9cba-4d82-9d79-179b3c93edd6
13,methods13," Delay in bedtime was frequent, especially among children older than 6 years of age, while inadequate sleeping hours were more frequent among children aged 6–10 years. disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS) were more likely among children under 6 years of age. No differences between gender were found in adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD) or sleeping habits. Boys showed a greater risk of the inadequate frequency of PA and use of TV-ED after lockdown. The probability of inadequate PA frequency was greater for older ages, while the probability of the inadequate frequency of TV-ED use was greater among children from ages 6 to 10 for both genders.  The proportion of optimal adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD) in our population (53%) was quite similar as the described before the COVID pandemic in children from Spain in 2004 (46% nationwide and 52% in the northeast region, which includes Catalonia) [8].",8fb93a15-808c-4be5-8d79-debd14ee3824
14,methods14," It is possible that adherence to Mediterranean diet (AMD) was not highly impacted by the lockdown due to different counteracting effects derived from it. On one hand, the restrictions imposed by leaving home only for permitted activities could result in limited access to fruits and vegetables [13]. However, remaining at home and closure of non-essential businesses could have reduced the exposure to processed food such as fast-food restaurants (Supplementary Table S2).  Regarding sleeping habits, we found that more than 80% of children aged 6–16 reported a delay in their bedtime during lockdown, as compared to their usual bedtime before the lockdown. Similar results among preschool children in China showed changes in sleep patterns characterized by later bedtimes [14]. They also found in the population studied later wake times, longer nocturnal periods, and shorter nap sleep durations during lockdown, as compared to a previous sleep assessment in 2018 [14].",0d6b05e6-ff3a-45e9-b5b7-f62cb0f5da4d
15,methods15," Changes in children’s usual day routine during lockdown could have impacted their sleeping habits in a similar way to how shift patterns occur during school breaks [15,16]. Delay in bedtime, as well as inadequate sleeping hours, could be, in part, triggered by an increased exposure to screens, as nighttime exposure to bright light suppresses melatonin production [17]. In our study, inadequate sleeping hours were more frequent among children aged 6–10 years, which was also the group with the greater increase in screen exposure after lockdown. We noted that the proportions of sleeping disorders reported in our study were consistent with the ones found in children before the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. In a study that examined the sleeping habits of children aged 2–14 during the period from 1987 to 2011, De Ruiter et al. found that almost 45% of children in Spain did not meet the recommended sleeping hours [18]. Cassanello et al.",a4ee3234-dd4f-4c31-a1de-9fff8c04fbf6
16,methods16," also found that more than 30% of parents of children aged 3–36 months perceived that their children had short night sleep hours and longer periods of nocturnal awakenings [19]. The greater proportion of children under 6 years with sleep disturbances after lockdown could be explained, in part, by the high dependence that small children have to their family environment [20]. In a context of greater familial stress and changes to household routines due to lockdown, stress among children can be also manifested as sleeping disorders [21,22].  Our study showed significant differences in the frequency of PA and the use of TV-ED before and after lockdown.",cebebc59-b4e6-4516-97d8-9e3fb3f7e098
17,methods17," The probability of the inadequate frequency of PA (performing one hour or more of PA per day, for less than 5 days in a week) in the overall study population was almost doubled after lockdown, while the probability of inadequate frequency in TV-ED use (spending more than 2 h per day either watching TV or using electronic devices for more than 2 days a week) was nine times higher after lockdown. Similar patterns have been described in the USA during the pandemic, where parents perceived significant decreases in their children’s PA and significant increases in sedentary behavior during the first months of the COVID-19 lockdown as compared to the pre-COVID period (February 2020) [23]. We also observed that gender differences in the probability of the inadequate frequency of PA increased with age. The age differences described in our study are consistent with the findings in the U.S.A.",63d567d6-a7f6-4143-bc6b-ae0e7840200c
18,methods18," during lockdown, where older children (9–13 years) were reported as spending more time playing computer or video games, or using electronic devices for leisure compared to younger children (5–8 years) [23].  Constraints in access to outdoor places after lockdown may have affected the duration and frequency of leisure PA, particularly among boys, as they usually practice outdoors sports [23], while girls are, in general, more engaged in activities such as dancing and workout training, which could still be performed indoors after lockdown. Outdoor constraints may also have a greater influence at older ages because gendered patterns of leisure activities are more marked towards adolescence. We noticed that, in our study, many children reporting a high frequency of PA after lockdown were those that performed activities with other relatives in the household.",af769a14-473e-44aa-ad14-f0d0b9271b56
19,methods19," Adult guidance and engagement during children’s PA could be a valuable strategy for maintaining adequate levels of PA after lockdown (Supplementary Table S3) [24].  Differences in the inadequate frequency of TV-ED use before and after lockdown were greater than the differences seen for PA. This could be partly explained by the fact that PA during lockdown could have been guided through electronic devices, resulting in a relative increment of screen time with respect to active time [25]. The fact that boys are more likely to engage in video games for leisure [26], which could have been increased during lockdown due to a lack of daily routines that structure their use of time, could also explain the higher risk of the inadequate frequency of TV-ED use seen in boys compared to girls [27].",781c6fe3-e980-4b4e-a0bd-65b9bd6855f7
20,methods20,"  Results from this study show that mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to the acquisition of behavioral patterns related to obesity and non-communicable disease (non communicable disease (NCD)) risk factors such as sleep disturbance and sedentarism [17,28]. These habits could potentially persist beyond the duration of the lockdown, worsening the pre-existing obesity pandemic that was already affecting children in middle- and high-income countries [16,27]. Therefore, it is necessary that these potential long-term consequences are considered in order to establish timely strategies that could diminish the development of non-communicable disease risk factors among children.  Establishing daily routines, with scheduled activities and limited screen exposure time during lockdown could play a key role in maintaining good sleeping and dietary patterns.",0e662726-eed4-4137-a6d4-758fa5d13a41
21,methods21," Allowing outdoor activity, even for small groups, could be beneficial for maintaining adequate levels of PA and for coping with stress through social interactions.  Even when other studies have assessed health behavior among children during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain [13], ours is, to our knowledge, the largest survey carried out in Catalonia assessing the differences in PA and TV-ED use before and after lockdown, and dietary and sleep habits after lockdown with standardized questionnaires.  Although the uncontrolled design limits the possibility of establishing the true impact of lockdown measures on children’s health behavior, the assessment of outcomes before and shortly after the lockdown reduced the influence of temporal trends and recall bias that usually confound uncontrolled before/after studies.",d2d4125c-fd3e-4cda-9b14-e483a96344e7
22,methods22," We noticed, however, a limitation in the way information was retrieved, as parents reporting children’s behavior could not only be plausible of recall bias, but also of certain inaccuracy, given that parental perceptions of child behaviors may not be the same as the perceptions children have of their own behaviors [29]. Nevertheless, it has been established that parental information is a method frequently used among scholars examining behavioral and developmental problems among young children, particularly in the study of sleeping habits [30] (References [31,32,33,34,35,36,37] are cited in the Supplementary Materials).  Our methodological approach allowed us to account for unmeasured within-children characteristics that remain invariant over time such as individual or family socioeconomic status.",2e2f3f88-611b-4c2e-8bd1-295a9a243bdf
23,methods23," Although our sample included children from different socioeconomic backgrounds attending public and private schools, it is possible that more disadvantaged socioeconomic groups with no internet access and not attending schools may have been underrepresented in our sample.  In this study we were not able to include an objective measure of the changes in children’s weight before and after the lockdown. However, we were able to register whether caregivers perceived any weight gain in children. We found that almost 25% of children included in the sample appeared to show weight gain, this being more frequent among those children with suboptimal (low and medium) adherence to Mediterranean diet (Table S4).  Our findings contribute to an initial approach in understanding the changes that lockdown measures could have on children’s health, and on the development of health risk factors over the life course.",fadf85a9-cca6-4407-a0ba-ffc3139d6e45
24,methods24,"  Further studies will need to assess whether the risk of inadequate frequency of PA and TV-ED use examined in this study during the first weeks of lockdown changes over time, in order to have a better knowledge of the long-term consequences that lockdown measures could have on children’s health behaviors.  5. Conclusions  Our study showed higher levels of sedentarism and lower levels of physical activity among children and adolescents after the implementation of lockdown as compared to in their previous lifestyle. This change in behavioral patterns at an early age pose a public health concern, as it could lead to risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disease during adulthood if such behaviors are sustained over time.",f05eda64-5714-41a9-bbcf-499e81ae3f4e
