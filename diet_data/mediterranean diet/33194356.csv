Bitter responses of olive oil phenolics and secoiridoids  To characterize the bitterness of olive oil phenolic compounds, we performed calcium mobilization experiments. The 25 bitter taste receptors, G protein chimera (Gα16-gus44), and the GCaMP calcium sensor68 were transiently expressed in HEK293E cells.

8,results3," 1) were tested for bitter taster receptor activation (Fig. 3). Oleocanthal, oleacein, oleoside-methylester, and tyrosol did not activate any TAS2Rs. In contrast, oleocanthalic acid, oleomissional, oleuropein and elenolic acid activated significantly the TAS2R8 receptor over background. Ligstroside aglycon, and Oleuropein aglycon activated TAS2R1, TAS2R8 and TAS2R14 receptors. To validate the single dose scanning results, we performed concentration–response experiments for all the compounds toward receptors TAS2R1, TAS2R8, and TAS2R14 that produced the most significant responses (Fig. 4). The results showed that of the three receptors, the TAS2R8 receptor yielded the highest and most potent response to oleuropein aglycon, which we called 100% and normalized responses of the other phenolic compounds relative to that (Emax = 100, EC50 = 57.3 µM). Ligstroside aglycon was equipotent but less efficacious than oleuropein aglycon (Emax = 59.2, EC50 = 57.3 µM).",20bf6d88-1afb-4644-b290-ed202101b46d

The TAS2R8 could also be activated weakly and less potently by oleocanthalic acid, oleomissional and elenolic acid.

11,discussion0," The current work provides important results concerning the structure–activity relationships of the secoiridoids-phenolics of the olive fruit and oil. Since the discovery of its structure in 196069, oleuropein (1) has been thought to be the main source of bitterness of the olive fruit considering its removal by hydrolysis and/or oxidation to make the olive fruit edible. Herein, we show that the derivatives of oleuropein hydrolysis present stronger or weaker potency of bitter receptor activation depending on their structural characteristics.  The oleuropein molecule (and similarly the ligstroside molecule) has three functional groups that can act as targets of hydrolysis. The first one is the ester group attaching the hydroxytyrosol (9) (or tyrosol (10)) moiety to the secoiridoid skeleton (see Fig. 1).",d6622183-03c5-48b8-b962-96950e650e64
12,discussion1," Hydrolysis of this group leads to oleoside-11-methyl ester (11) and hydroxytyrosol (or tyrosol) both compounds that failed to activate any bitter receptor (at least up to the concentration tested). The second functional group is the glycosidic bond between glucose and the secoiridoid skeleton. Removal of the glucose moiety from oleuropein (or ligstroside) leads to an unstable aglycon form (12 or 13) that is spontaneously transformed to a mixture of two diastereomeric oleuropeindials (3a,b) (or ligstrodials (4a,b)), which are in equilibrium with the corresponding enolic form named oleomissional (3c) (or oleokoronal (4c)), all of them having an open ring structure. This mixture of the three compounds in equilibrium can be rearranged to a stable closed ring form (5a,b or 6a,b), existing in two possible diastereomeric forms, with mainly one of them naturally predominating in olive oil. This rearrangement has been found to be dependent on the pH of the medium.",24a3cdbd-c087-4623-b3ec-fb5080c476c2
13,discussion2," Interestingly, the loss of glucose led to compounds with increased potency for activation of bitter receptors. The oleomissional equilibrium mixture (3a,b,c) was more potent than oleuropein (1) and the closed ring forms (5a,b) were almost 50 times more potent than oleuropein and significantly more potent than all other tested compounds. The closed ring form of ligstroside aglycon (6a) showed similar but slightly less potent activity than the oleuropein aglycon closed ring forms (5a,b), showing that the substitution pattern of the aromatic ring is not crucial for the activity. Comparison between the two closed ring isomers of oleuropein aglycon 5a and 5b showed that the stereochemistry of the rearranged secoiridoid ring does not have a very crucial role either.",4e01511c-47d0-41db-ade9-9eeb97bb701d
14,discussion3," Interestingly, simultaneous removal of the hydroxytyrosol and the glucose moiety from the molecule of oleuropein leading to elenolic acid (14a,b) showed higher potency than oleuropein but lower than oleuropein aglycon (5a,b), suggesting that the presence of the aromatic ring is important for the activity. Comparison between elenolic acid (14a,b) and oleoside methyl ester (11) showed that the removal of glucose is also very important for the potency of activation of the bitter receptors.  The final part of the molecule that can be a target of hydrolysis is the methyl ester at C-11 of oleuropein or ligstroside. This ester is removed during malaxation for the production of olive oil by specific esterases leading to unstable carboxy derivatives that are spontaneously decarboxylated. This reaction happening to oleomissional (3c) or oleokoronal (4c) leads correspondingly to oleacein (7) or oleocanthal (8). Interestingly, both compounds did not show any activation of bitter receptors.",112c9b9e-4f88-4851-bf0e-0ed3249b0c5f
15,discussion4," However, oxidation of oleocanthal (8) to oleocanthalic acid (16) increased the activity of the bitter receptors. Oleocanthalic acid (and its counterpart oleaceinic acid (15)) are formed during aging of olive oil and this could explain the retention of some bitterness in aged olive oils.  The above structure–activity information can be summarized in that the most important structural requirement for activation of bitter taste receptors by olive secoiridoid phenolics is the absence of the glucose moiety and the presence of a rearranged closed ring combined with an aromatic group. The open ring forms (3a,b,c) retain some potency, but this is much lower compared to those with closed ring forms (5a,b or 6a,b) and is almost completely lost when the open ring forms are decarboxymethylated (7 or 8).",0cb41f7d-46e2-4c81-9e19-9ea85155ffc1
16,discussion5," However, the decarboxymethylated derivatives (oleocanthal and oleacein) are known as TRPA1 receptor activators leading to the pungent effect of olive oil and this is also a very important organoleptic attribute of olive oil. It will be interesting in the future to compare the actions of these phenolic compounds on atomic resolution structures of these protein targets in order to understand their specific binding and actions.  Concerning potential practical applications of the above observations, it is obvious that production of olive oils with reduced bitterness should be performed in such a way that would reduce the content of the closed or open ring aglycons. We have recently shown that the time and temperature of malaxation can play a crucial role towards this direction70. More specifically, we have shown that for specific varieties (e.g.",9da42bd1-5bf3-49e5-9b94-e1f5f8e88d3d
17,discussion6," Koroneiki or Athinolia) the condition of malaxation (45–60 min at 28 °C) can lead to increased transformation of oleuropein (3a,b,c) and ligstroside aglycons (4a,b,c) to oleacein (7) and oleocanthal (8) respectively. In contrast, very short time (15 min) or low temperature (< 23 °C) of malaxation can reduce the oleocanthal or oleacein content in favor of the more bitter aglycons but may also lead to a reduction in oil yield and oil overall flavor.  Another very interesting observation is that malaxation under acidic conditions (e.g. by adding citric acid in the malaxation pulp) can block the rearrangement of the open ring aglycons (3a,b,c or 4a,b,c) to the closed ring ones (5a,b or 6a,b) and can also block the decarboxymethylation reaction71. This could serve as an alternative way to produce olive oil with reduced bitterness and pungency.",e53cd6ec-56e2-4461-b801-59b7cdcd9383
18,discussion7,"  Regarding the olive debittering process it should be noted that the real target should not only be the removal of oleuropein, as traditionally considered, but also the reduction of the aglycons concentration, achieved by the combined action of glucosidase and esterases. Oleuropein has indeed low potency towards the receptor TAS2R8 but we hypothesize that when we chew on a raw olive fruit the intolerable bitter sensation is mainly triggered by the spontaneous transformation of oleuropein to the aglycon forms and not only by oleuropein itself. Oleuropein and oleuropein glucosidase are found in separated cellular compartments72 and can come in contact only when the olive fruit cells are damaged, as it happens when we chew on a raw olive fruit or when the olive fruit is crushed for the production of olive oil.  In conclusion, we isolated and tested bitter taste receptor responses of 12 phenolic compounds from olive oil using the calcium mobilization functional assay.",2ea6d478-1183-46a0-87ef-24d4850daadb
19,discussion8," Seven out of twelve phenolics activated TAS2R8, and five of them activated TAS2R1, TAS2R8, and TAS2R14 (Table 1). The phenolic compounds ligstroside aglycon and oleuropein aglycon were the most potent bitter tastants in olive oil. TAS2R1 and TAS2R8 were the major bitter taste receptors responding to phenolic compounds, while TAS2R14 showed a mild response to some of the phenolics. Oleuropein activated TAS2R8 only, but the potency was much lower (50-fold) compared to the algycons. Oleocanthalic acid, oleomissinal, elenolic acid activated TAS2R8 with lower potency. The four phenolics tested, oleacein, oleoside-methylester, oleocanthal, tyrosol failed to activate any TAS2Rs. Organoleptic studies with controlled concentrations of our identified bitter tasting compounds should follow this work to test whether sensory data agree with the TAS2R data presented in the present study.",d486e778-7e9c-4f7b-bf04-b71a8c096307
