0,methods0," Antimicrobial Agents  Extra virgin olive oil (Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) (Olea europaea L., Coratina cultivar) was obtained from a local market in the Puglia region (Italy). The polyphenolic fraction was extracted as described in Francioso et al. (2020). Briefly, NaDESs were prepared by mixing two components (choline:glycerol 1:1.5 molar ratio and choline:propylene glycol 1:3.3 molar ratio) at 70°C under magnetic stirring for 1 h. After cooling, Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was added to the NaDESs in the ratio of 1:20 v/v (NaDES:Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)). The extraction was carried out under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 15 min and then transferred via a separatory funnel for decantation and phases separation. The extract was analyzed to determine the total polyphenol content and polyphenolic composition.  In addition, two pure compounds purified from Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (following the method described in Francioso et al.",b0966b0c-4cf8-4cdc-8072-e54b01a80c42

Determination of Total Phenols  Total phenols were determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu assay as described by Singleton and Rossi (1965). Briefly, the reaction solution was prepared by mixing 790 μl of distilled water with 10 μl of standard, sample, or blank. To these, 50 μl of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germania) was added, incubated for 3 min at room temperature, and then 150 μl of 20% (w/v) Na2CO3 was added. After 2 h of incubation, the absorbance at 760 nm was measured using a Hitachi U2000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The results were expressed as gallic acid equivalents (gallic acid equivalents (GAE)).",5f530116-0656-475e-873f-db36e3f05211
2,methods2,"  Polyphenolic Analysis by UPLC-DAD/MS  Polyphenolic analysis of the extracts was performed on a Waters Acquity H-Class UPLC system, as previously described by Francioso et al. (2020). The chromatographic system was coupled to a photodiode array and a single-quadruple mass detector with an electrospray ionization source. Chromatography was performed on a reverse-phase C18 column (Phenomenex Kinetex, 100 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 2.6 μm particle size). Solvent A was 0.1% aqueous formic acid (Merck), and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in Methanol (UPLC gradient grade, Merck). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the column temperature was set at 35°C. Elution was performed with a linear gradient from 2 to 100% B in a total time of 17 min including re-equilibration. The samples were diluted in the mobile phase and injected through the needle. The photodiode array detector was set up in the range of 200–600 nm.",cc9d0dda-5c06-46fc-b119-f7fd3be5c09f
3,methods3," Mass spectrometric detection was performed in the negative electrospray ionization mode, using nitrogen as the nebulizer gas. Analyses were performed in the Total Ion Current (Total Ion Current (TIC)) mode with a mass range of 50–1000 m/z. The capillary voltage was 0.8 kV, cone voltage 15 V, ion source temperature 120°C, and probe temperature 600°C. Compounds were identified by retention time, m/z, UV-Vis spectrum, and comparing them with commercially available standards (obtained from Merck). Quantification of each compound was performed by using standard calibration curves in the range of 0.1–2 nmol.  Microbial Strains and Cultures  The antimicrobial activity was investigated against a representative range of standard bacterial strains and drug-resistant bacterial clinical isolates. Specifically, standard strains included Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) ATCC 6538, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) ATCC 15442, Escherichia coli (E.",81ff4b50-ec40-473a-a6f1-7b87668fccef

Resistant bacterial strains included clinical isolates of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and β-lactamase (extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL))-producing strains such as E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). Last, yeasts such as Candida albicans (C. albicans) ATCC 10231 and a clinical strain of Candida parapsilosis (C. parapsilosis) were examined. Clinical strains were isolated, at the Microbiology Unit of the University Hospital in Rome, from samples processed during routine analysis and cultured in accordance with guidelines approved by the management of the hospital for routine care purposes. Then, all isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF, Bruker, Bremen, Germany).

No significant cytotoxicity was observed at the concentrations that showed antimicrobial activities (Supplementary Figure S1). ",3360980e-678d-4919-a6c7-556247ac7144
29,discussion0," To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the antimicrobial activity of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts using as two natural solvents NaDESs (choline/glycerol and choline/propylene glycol). In addition, its main components, oleacein and oleocanthal in choline/glycerol and choline/propylene glycol, have also been investigated. The main result of clinical importance was the inhibitory activity of the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extract in choline/glycerol and that of oleacein in choline/propylene glycol toward drug-resistant Gram-positive and -negative bacterial strains. Specifically, the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extract in choline/glycerol showed the highest antibacterial activity against several clinical strains of S. aureus, whereas oleacein in choline/propylene glycol was the most effective toward various clinical strains of E. coli, P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae.",469b0dd7-3119-4be3-9b0f-7af7c3e83b2b
30,discussion1,"  The highest inhibitory effect of the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extract in choline/glycerol against drug-resistant strains of S. aureus may be attributed to the synergistic effect of its main components as detected by UPLC/DAD/MS analysis (oleacein, oleocanthal, and oleuropein aglycone), since, in our study, both oleacein and oleocanthal alone were less active. Also, Karygianni et al. (2019) demonstrated low antibacterial activity of oleacein, oleocanthal, and oleuropein alone toward S. aureus, further suggesting that the combination of the components present in our Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extract might possess a higher effect.  Of note, the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extract in choline/glycerol was also active toward different drug-resistant Gram-negative strains including P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae.",439fa9b7-9d39-4e60-96ee-5cabbb56cd17
31,discussion2," Such effects may be due to the ability of choline/glycerol to extract more hydrophilic compounds from Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), such as oleacein, that might be more effective against Gram-negative bacteria since their outer membrane surrounding the cell wall has been described to hinder the diffusion of non-polar molecules through the lipopolysaccharide (Vaara, 1992; Denyer and Maillard, 2002).  Even more important is the highest inhibitory effect of oleacein in choline/propylene glycol toward all the multidrug-resistant Gram-negative strains examined, including the ESKAPE pathogens such as P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. ESKAPE pathogens have been recognized as a considerable public health concern because their resistance has reached alarming levels, requiring urgent intervention as underlined by the most recent WHO reports (World Health Organization, 2017).",d7f0f17d-333a-4045-a2e2-fcd2a8145081
32,discussion3," ESKAPE pathogens are usually encountered in the hospital setting and may become, in the future, a serious threat in community settings where the overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents are increasing.  The highest antibacterial activity of oleacein in choline/propylene glycol toward multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria may also be due to its NaDES content (2.1–8.4% v/v) since our preliminary experiments showed a lower activity of oleacein in methanol. Such effect is also suggested by evidence in the literature, where oleacein in another solvent (1.1% of DMSO) has been demonstrated to be less active toward Gram-negative strains . A potential mechanism through which choline/propylene glycol may augment the antibacterial effect of oleacein might consist in increased membrane permeability and/or damaged morphology of bacterial cells, facilitating the uptake of the active compound.",cb1ff2fc-1974-4ba4-8ccf-a67a0f8b981f
33,discussion4," Indeed, many studies demonstrated that NaDESs significantly increase the bioavailability of bioactive molecules and drugs (Faggian et al., 2016; Sut et al., 2017; Jeliński et al., 2019; da Silva et al., 2021; Mustafa et al., 2021).  In addition to improving the antimicrobial activity, the usage of NaDESs also has additional advantages; NaDESs are characterized by a low environmental impact, combined with the optimization of the extraction of active principles. Indeed, toxic by-products or residual solvents are not generated , as also supported by the absence of cytotoxic effects found in our study.  Another interesting finding observed in our study is the marked antifungal activity of all the assayed compounds, including Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extract, oleacein as well as oleocanthal in both NaDESs, and Candida spp.",22b54e84-7dc5-4dcc-afd9-7ea6a762e4ed
34,discussion5," To date, available antifungal drugs are few, and their widespread use has led to the development of drug resistance in the treatment of Candida infections, a problem of growing importance, especially in immunodeficient conditions (Pristov and Ghannoum, 2019).  Overall, our results are another interesting piece of the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) puzzle and, mainly, of its antimicrobial properties. Indeed, in the literature, there are mentions of the antimicrobial activity of olive oil extracts on numerous standard microorganisms including S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans, foodborne pathogens such as, Listeria spp., Salmonella spp. and several clinical isolates such as Helicobacter pylori, Shigella sonnei, Bacteroides spp., and Yersinia spp. (Medina et al., 2006; Romero et al., 2007; Medina et al., 2009; Fei et al., 2018, 2019; Guo et al., 2019; Nazzaro et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020).",e18823cb-af82-44e5-89cb-9b7c123cf75e
35,discussion6," Nevertheless, a comparison of the antibacterial activity observed among several studies is quite difficult since different experimental protocols and a diverse variety of olive plants and different types of olive oil (olive oil, virgin olive oil, Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)), were used. Regarding the chemical composition, it is well known that it depends on different factors such as cultivar, geographic origin, climatic conditions, and processing techniques (De Santis et al., 2019). In addition, the type of bioactive compounds of olive oil extracts is influenced by the chemical properties of the extraction solvent, as evidenced by our study where an Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extract rich in oleocanthal and oleacein was obtained by using NaDES.  Oleocanthal and oleacein have already been described to have antimicrobial activity against several standards strains such as E. coli, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, H.",ec641c35-4ffd-4e76-91a8-fad00b449b7c
36,discussion7," pylori, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis, oral streptococci, and anaerobic pathogenic bacteria as well as against C. albicans (Medina et al., 2006; Romero et al., 2007; Medina et al., 2009; Karygianni et al., 2019). In our study, similar minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of oleocanthal and oleacein for E. coli and lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for S. aureus and C. albicans were observed as compared to data of Karygianni et al. (2019), which used the same method for evaluating the antimicrobial activity.  The strength of our study lies in the investigation of several drug-resistant strains, which might better characterize the potential antibacterial activity of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), oleocanthal and oleacein. However, the lack of data regarding the mechanisms by which these natural compounds may inhibit the growth of clinical isolates or cause bacterial cell death represents the main limitations of our study. However, Guo et al.",79788e40-dea1-42b0-83d2-b744e3c897fe
37,discussion8," (2019, 2020) found that the antibacterial effect of the olive oil polyphenol extract against several foodborne pathogens such as L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and S. typhimurium was related to lower intracellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate, cell depolarization, decrease in bacterial protein and DNA, and cell fluid leakage due to destruction of cell morphology.  In conclusion, our study shows that the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extract in choline/glycerol and oleacein in choline/propylene glycol have potential activity against multidrug-resistant S. aureus and several ESKAPE pathogens. In the future, given their broad antimicrobial activity, Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-based formulations in NaDES might be an interesting strategy that may help in reducing the risk of development of drug resistance. Under this perspective, the usage of NaDES for the preparation of new antimicrobial formulations may represent a new approach that deserves further research.",916a3134-446b-48a8-8242-f910aa86fc7e
