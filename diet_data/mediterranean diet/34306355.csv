0,methods0," Study design and participants  Longitudinal population-based study analysing data from healthy pregnant women who participated in the ECLIPSES trial as well as data from their children. Details of the study's protocol have been described elsewhere30. Briefly, the ECLIPSES is an ongoing mother–child cohort study that evaluates the long-term impact of dietary, psychological and environmental factors during pregnancy on offspring outcomes (including physical and neurobehavioral development)30. A total of 793 pregnant women were recruited during the first prenatal visit (before the 12th gestational week (GW)) by midwives from 12 sexual and reproductive health care services (and reproductive health care services (ASSIR)) of the Catalan Institute of Health (Institut Català de La Salut (ICS)) in the province of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain), between 2013 and 2017. Eligible participants were healthy adult women older than 18 years with ≤ 12 weeks of gestation.",1e4cc1fe-b354-46fc-9812-ae0a5e5e8621
1,methods1," Further details of the inclusion/exclusion criteria can be found elsewhere30. The ECLIPSES trial is registered on both the ClinicalTrials.gov (identification number NCT03196882) and the EU Clinical Trials Register (EUCTR-2012-005480-28). This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Jordi Gol Institute for Primary Care Research (IDIAP) and the Pere Virgili Institute for Health Research (IISPV). All participants signed an informed consent form. The study complies with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.  Dietary assessment  Eating habits were assessed through a self-administered food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) regarding 45-food groups, previously validated in our population31. Women reported usual food consumption in each trimester of pregnancy (at weeks 12, 24, and 36 gestation). The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s were explained and collected by specialized midwives.",294f8a07-d85a-4327-a2aa-a1f5dd3066e1
2,methods2," Nutritionists then reviewed the questionnaires and recorded the food data. Women reported their usual frequency of consumption of foods and drinks per week or per month. The average consumption rations of each item were obtained and compared with the dietary guidelines of the Sociedad Española de Nutrición Comunitaria (Sociedad Española de Nutrición Comunitaria (SENC))32. Each food item was then converted into consumption in grams per day by applying the average consumption ration for our population according to data previously obtained in the consumption surveys conducted by the research group31; for example: milk (220 g), salad (100 g), legumes (60 g), eggs (55 g), meat (150 g), fish (150 g), fruit (100 g), among others. From this information we estimated total daily energy intake and macro- and micronutrients by primarily using the REGAL food composition table33 and other tables published for Spanish foods34.",b9a3169e-bb17-4043-b50c-8af4ba09917a
3,methods3,"  We were interested in the effects of adherence to the MedDiet during pregnancy, which we assessed by using the relative MedDiet (rMedDiet) score based on the intake of nine components: fruits (including nuts and seeds but excluding fruit juices), vegetables, legumes, cereals (including whole-grain and refined flour, pasta, rice, other grains), fresh fish (including prawns and shellfish), meat (including processed meat), dairy products (including milk, yogurt, cheese, and cream desserts), olive oil, and alcohol. This score is a modified version of the original Mediterranean Diet Score35, which has been previously used in a pregnant population36. All the food groups (except alcohol) were measured as g/1000 kcal/day, and were divided into tertiles. The lowest tertile was coded as 0, the medium tertile as 1 and the highest as 2 for fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fresh fish and olive oil.",924cf03a-3571-4105-bee5-425f27c51c15
4,methods4," Conversely, the lowest tertile was coded as 2, medium as 1 and highest as 0 for meat and dairy products. Alcohol intake, considered as harmful during pregnancy, was scored as a dichotomous variable and coded with 0 for women who consumed alcohol and 2 for women who did not drink alcohol. After adding together the scores for each component, the resulting score ranged from 0 to 18 points, with higher scores indicating a greater adherence to MedDiet, and therefore, higher diet quality. For the purpose of these analyses, we assessed the adherence to MedDiet throughout pregnancy (n = 614 in the first; n = 493 in the second and n = 440 in the third trimesters). If dietary data was not available in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, the average score was calculated using the available data.",50dc3f2c-538b-4a13-ac36-6701af002909
5,methods5," Because there are no pre-established cut-off points for the pregnant population, the score was divided into tertiles to reflect low (tertile 1, 0–9 points), medium (tertile 2, 10–11 points), and high (tertile 3, 12–18 points) adherence to the rMedDiet.  Newborn anthropometric measurements  Infant’s sex (male, female) and anthropometric measurements, including body weight (g), height (cm), and HC (cm) were measured at birth. Neonatal anthropometric parameters were measured just after birth by the obstetrician or midwife using standard procedures. These measurements were used to calculate the weight to length ratio (g/cm) and Ponderal Index (PI) using the established equation PI = weight (g) × 100)/length3 (cm). Gestational age at delivery was established by obstetricians based on the first day of the last menstrual period reported at recruitment and corrected by ultrasound measurements recorded at about 12 GW.",4ad4c52a-5bab-4f18-8fab-088608f8aa15
6,methods6,"  Outcome variables used in the current study were birth weight, birth length, birth HC, anthropometric indices (weight-length ratio and PI), and small for gestational age (SGA) at birth, the criteria for which were newborns with birth anthropometric measurements below the 10th percentile according to the gestational age- and sex-specific reference growth curves based on INTERGROWTH-21st international standards37.  Assessment of covariates  We recorded information regarding maternal age, socio-economic level, educational level (primary, secondary and university studies), lifestyle habits (including physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption), and medical and obstetric history (including parity, planned pregnancy, and type of delivery (at birth)) in the first trimester of pregnancy (at week 12). Midwives and nutritionists compiled this information during personal interviews and from specific questionnaires.",7dd37081-cac8-4b52-badc-59c727672a1c
7,methods7," Socioeconomic level was calculated according to occupational status using the Catalan classification of occupations (CCO-2011)38 and was classified as low, middle, high. Physical activity was measured using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-S)39. At enrolment and each trimester thereafter, maternal weight (in kg to the nearest 0.1 kg) and height (in cm to the nearest 0.1 cm) were also measured. Based on the criteria proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO)40, the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight/height squared (kg/m2) and women were classified as normal weight (body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2) or excess weight (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2). Total gestational weight gain (GWG) was calculated and conditioned by the initial body mass index (BMI) was categorized into insufficient, adequate or excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) according to the 2009 IOM recommendations41.

8,analysis0," Descriptive statistics were expressed as mean ± SD for quantitative variables and number of women (%) for categorical variables. ANOVA and the chi-square test were used, as appropriate, to test differences in baseline characteristics across categories of rMedDiet adherence score (low, medium, and high adherence).  The associations between the maternal rMeDiet adherence score and small for gestational age (SGA) for birth weight, length and HC were assessed using logistic regression models with rMeDiet as both a categorical (lowest category as reference) and a continuous variable. In the latter case, we calculated the associations of small for gestational age (SGA) risk with a 1-point increase in the rMeDiet score. Estimates were presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).",9469407f-55ac-4a53-ae75-37ee18410b1c

10,analysis2,"  The potential effect modification was assessed through stratified analyses for maternal age (< 30, ≥ 30 years), pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (normal weight, excess weight), gestational weight gain (GWG) (insufficient, adequate, excessive), educational levels (primary or lower/secondary, university), social class (low/middle, high), smoking during pregnancy (yes, no), and having a planned pregnancy (yes, no). Multivariable-adjusted OR (95% CIs) per one-point increase in maternal rMeDiet score was presented. Interactions were tested with the likelihood ratio tests, which involved comparing models with and without cross-product terms, and were not significant at the significance level of ≤ 0.05.  Finally, as a sensitivity analysis to assess the consistency of our results, we repeated the main analysis but this time excluding premature newborns (gestational age < 37 weeks, n = 19 infants, 1.6% of total).

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the mothers and newborns according to the maternal rMeDiet adherence score categories during pregnancy. Overall, the mean age of the mothers was 30.5 (SD 5.1) years and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was 25.1 (SD 4.5) kg/m2. Approximately 30% of mothers had a university education, 19% were of high social class, and 17% of them smoked during pregnancy.

As shown in Table 1, no statistically significant differences between maternal rMedDiet adherence categories were found regarding newborn anthropometric measurements (birth weight, length, and HC) or indices (weight to length ratio and PI). Likewise, the findings remained unchanged in all of the anthropometric parameters when we carried out separate multivariate linear regression analyses adjusted for all confounders listed above plus the infant’s sex and gestational age, with the lowest rMedDiet category used as a reference (data not shown).",eb3a4657-a099-4f63-8188-07e036054541

We also re-ran the analyses after excluding premature newborns but found no change in the results (data not shown).

19,discussion0," In the present study, we found that pregnant women with a high rMedDiet adherence score had a significantly lower risk of having a small for gestational age (SGA) (< 10th percentile) infant in terms of weight and HC, and a nonsignificant decrease in risk of small for gestational age (SGA) in terms of length. Our study adds to current knowledge regarding the influence of maternal diet on foetal growth and highlights the importance of promoting a healthy MedDiet eating pattern early in pregnancy as an effective strategy for preventing small for gestational age (SGA) births.  Nevertheless, the findings of various studies regarding specific dietary patterns during pregnancy and their effects on newborn growth parameters have been heterogeneous and inconclusive, including those that have analysed the Mediterranean-style diet16,17.",3b8da4da-a598-4cf2-bc05-9a1bfdac24ee
20,discussion1," Importantly, dietary patterns and the content of the specific food groups consumed are subject to regional variations that are influenced by sociocultural and geographical differences. This could explain in part the lack of consensus on this subject matter.  Our results on small for gestational age (SGA) (< 10th percentile) weight, the most frequently used indicator of foetal growth restriction (foetal growth restriction (FGR)), are generally consistent with previous studies conducted in the Mediterranean area that have explored the possible relationship between maternal Mediterranean-style diet adherence and foetal growth25–27. For example, recently Martínez-Galiano et al.",40952e3f-4d61-422f-910f-897a0bb95d8b
21,discussion2,"25 in a case–control study in Spain (518 small for gestational age (SGA) and 518 controls) with dietary assessment at the beginning of pregnancy, reported that women with high MedDiet adherence were less likely to deliver small for gestational age (SGA) infants, regardless of the index used to evaluate the MedDiet adherence (PREDIMED, Trichopoulou and Panagiotakos). Similarly, in two large mother–child cohorts in Spain (INMA-Atlantic and INMA-Mediterranean, n = 2461) and Greece (RHEA, n = 889)26, an inverse association with greater adherence to a MedDiet in early pregnancy was observed for risk of small for gestational age (SGA) in INMA-Mediterranean, but no significant associations were reported in INMA-Atlantic and RHEA cohorts. Food group intakes and the mean MedDiet score differed significantly across cohorts, which is possibly the reason for the diversity of results.",d9b25e77-cd8b-43f0-90cf-b64c3f043ca1
22,discussion3," Another Greek study27, based on a small sample (n = 82) with a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) applied at the end of gestation, found that poor maternal adherence to the MedDiet was associated with greater risk of intrauterine growth-restriction, and lower z-scores of birth weight and body mass index (BMI).  However, the data published from areas outside the Mediterranean basin were not completely consistent. Supporting our results, a recent prospective cohort study (n = 1948) in the USA found that greater maternal adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet in early pregnancy was related to a reduced risk of small for gestational age (SGA) and low birth weight (LBW)42. Also in the USA, in the Boston Birth Cohort (Boston Birth Cohort (BBC)) study (n = 8507)21 the MedDiet was inversely associated with risk of low birth weight (LBW) and small for gestational age (SGA), although the last relationship did not reach statistical significance.",a17f832b-1db7-48c8-9b76-186387689a83
23,discussion4," In another study carried out in the Generation R cohort of 3207 Caucasian pregnant mothers in Rotterdam20, low adherence to the MedDiet in early pregnancy was also associated with decreased intra-uterine size and lower weight at birth. However, in contrast to our results, the Infant Feeding Practices Study II22 of a prospective cohort of 893 pregnant US women found a nonsignificant decrease in small for gestational age (SGA) risk with greater adherence to a MedDiet during the third trimester. A study conducted in Guadeloupe (French West Indies), the TIMOUN Mother–Child Cohort study (n = 728)23, found no association between MedDiet adherence during pregnancy and risk of foetal growth restriction (FGR) in the entire sample of women. However, the authors reported a slight decrease in the risk of foetal growth restriction (FGR) associated with a higher MedDiet score among underweight and normal-weight women (P heterogeneity < 0.01)23, which is in line with our observations.",6b841d65-610c-4c41-9a18-1791fee865d0
24,discussion5," Interestingly, our study found negative associations with small for gestational age (SGA) in both normal-weight and overweight pregnant women with higher adherence to the MedDiet during pregnancy. This suggests that high adherence to this pattern might modify the detrimental impact of maternal body mass index (BMI) on foetal growth.  It is notable that our results are also further supported by another study that focuses on maternal diet patterns which share certain similarities with the MedDiet pattern. Knudsen et al.43 in a large population-based mother–child cohort study of almost 45,000 Danish women found that a “health conscious” antenatal dietary pattern of vegetables, fruits, poultry and fish was associated with lower chances of small for gestational age (SGA) when compared to the “Western” pattern.",d22567e2-a307-45d0-8a47-ef24a921a206
25,discussion6," Another study44 involving 2000 pregnant women in New Zealand showed that mothers who had higher scores in a ‘traditional’ diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and dairy products in early pregnancy were less likely to deliver a small for gestational age (SGA) infant. Finally, a recently published US study (n = 862)24 showed that a higher quality maternal diet, which was regarded as maternal adherence to the Alternative Healthy Eating Index during early pregnancy, was associated with decreased small for gestational age (SGA) risk.  These findings taken together with our current analysis suggest that healthy dietary patterns during pregnancy and in particular the MedDiet or combinations of higher intakes of food items typical of this pattern may be effective in preventing small for gestational age (SGA) at birth.  We have also observed that having a high adherence to the rMedDeit was also associated with a reduced risk of small for gestational age (SGA) for HC.",62883a0d-79c2-45a9-a93c-5405e9f8709d
26,discussion7," As with infants born with a low weight, infants with a small HC at birth are also susceptible to a higher risk of non-optimal neurodevelopment, poor academic performance, low social competence and increased behavioural problems later in life45. Contrary to our findings, a study within the INMA and RHEA cohorts26 found no association between maternal MedDiet and small for gestational age (SGA) for HC. In the Generation R study, a trend towards a smaller HC at birth was observed for women with low MedDiet adherence in late pregnancy; however, associations were not significant after adjusting for confounders20. The limited amount of evidence in this field makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions, and further research is required.  Our main focus in studying the rMedDiet pattern was on diet quality as a whole.",a5729a38-bf79-43ac-ac04-fa9e449cb5f3
27,discussion8," In our study, high compliance with this healthy diet pattern not only consisted, as expected, of a higher consumption of fruits and nuts, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fresh fish and seafood, and a lower consumption of meat, processed meat, and dairy products, reflecting the traditional MedDiet pattern, but also resulted in a more favourable overall nutritional profile among pregnant women. Notably, these women consumed relatively more polyunsaturated fatty acid, fibre, iron, antioxidant vitamins (vitamins A and E) and beta-carotene, vitamin D, B6, and folate. All these are key nutrients that have been shown to be important for achieving appropriate foetal growth and development8, which explains in part the associations that we observed. For instance, inflammatory processes and oxidative stress in early pregnancy can interfere with normal placentation, which can adversely affect foetal development46.",37e6b8cb-b7ff-43f6-b2aa-07cdaccc3fef
28,discussion9," A maternal diet rich in vegetables and fruits in pregnancy, sources of vitamins A and E, and beta-carotene with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, may protect against oxidative damage and inflammation47 and, subsequently, decrease the risk of small for gestational age (SGA). In addition, it has been suggested that omega-3 fatty acids EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have beneficial effects for increasing birthweight and reducing the incidence of small for gestational age (SGA)48. This effect is probably linked to their influence on placental blood flow7. As has been described, PUFA are also critical fatty acids for the development of most organs, but their major impact is on the foetal development of brain. Moreover, it has been shown that inadequate maternal intake of other micronutrients can also increase the risk of small for gestational age (SGA) birth.",f63b3180-b39e-4f54-ac9e-d9ddf01dcc63
29,discussion10," Folate, iron, and vitamin D, among others, play a crucial role as substrates and cofactors in multiple pathways of cellular processes, including synthesis of nucleic acids and cellular division, red blood cell production and enzyme activity. Their deficiency in these mechanisms can lead to foetal growth retardation that results in reduced birth size among neonates8. In contrast, a larger consumption of foods that do not fit the traditional MedDiet, such as red and processed meat, dairy products, refined grains, and sweetened and alcoholic beverages, might positively impact small for gestational age (SGA) risk16,17.  It is important to consider that infant birth size is the end-point of different growth patterns determined by multiple maternal environmental factors, regardless of genetics, which in turn enhances the possibility of residual confounding.",d43b4d2b-e85b-4d68-b363-e880bb147fa3
30,discussion11," In contrast to previous studies in this field, we carried out stratified analyses to assess how maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), gestational weight gain (GWG), education level, social class, smoking during pregnancy, and planned pregnancy influence the effect of the rMedDiet. We found that all subgroups showed similar trends regarding the link between greater adherence to a rMedDiet and a decreased risk of small for gestational age (SGA) weight and HC. In the present study, we also supported other environmental factors that have been considered important contributors for small for gestational age (SGA) risk, such as gestational weight gain (GWG) and, in particular, insufficient maternal weight gain.

Importantly, adjustment of our analyses for potential confounders linked to small for gestational age (SGA) did not change the associations obtained. Therefore, we can confirm that our results are robust under different modelling approaches.  Our study has certain strengths. First of all, the study included a relatively large sample size and a prospective design, leading to a much greater likelihood of reliable conclusions. In addition, we conducted subgroup analyses, which have seldom been performed in previous studies, and we employed a widely used rMedDiet score, thus strengthening the credibility of our observations. Nevertheless, we also acknowledge some limitations.",9d3a3da8-2700-42d3-b1d8-27849ed9eeca
32,discussion13," Our study involved healthy pregnant women living in the Mediterranean region, which restricts the generalizability of our results to other study populations or non-Mediterranean settings. Another limitation of the study, as in most epidemiological studies on diet, was the likelihood of measurement error in the diet estimates from the self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), although our food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was specially developed and validated in our population.  In summary, this study suggests that high compliance with the MedDiet pattern during pregnancy appears to be favourable for reducing the risk of small for gestational age (SGA) (< 10th percentile) birth weight, HC and length, suggesting that this diet pattern has a positive effect on foetal growth.",b71088df-a447-4730-8a6c-95c5b22871ea
