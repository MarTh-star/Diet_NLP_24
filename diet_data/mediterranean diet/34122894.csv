0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Participants  This longitudinal analysis was performed in the framework of the PREDIMED-Plus-Cognition sub-study (n = 487) (see Figure S1. Flowchart for the sampling, Supplementary Materials), a subset sample of the clinical trial PREDIMED-Plus, a large, multicentric, randomized study (n = 6874) that aimed to assess the effect of an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet, physical activity promotion and behavioral intervention on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The design, procedure and population was reported previously [26], and its full protocol is available in the RCT website (https://predimedplus.com, accessed on 1 April 2022). The trial was registered at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial in the year 2014, with the number ISRCTN89898870.",c59c6556-d541-4b40-8ca3-8a415d024469
1,methods1," Criteria for selecting the subjects were as follows: community-dwelling adults with Metabolic Syndrome (with any 3 of 5 risk factors [27]), aged between 55 and 75 years, with a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) between 27 and 40 kg/m2. Participants with diabetes constituted approximately 25% of the final total PREDIMED-Plus sample. Individuals were recruited from 23 Spanish health centers that participated in the study, between October 2013 and December 2016, and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention is based on an energy restricted MedDiet, with behavioral support and physical activity. The individuals randomized into the control group were advised to follow an unrestricted MedDiet without any further indication.  2.2. Procedure  The Cognition sub-study had a specific objective, to perform an in-depth assessment of psychological and cognitive performance in this sub-sample.",a51116e9-b90e-4880-b2d5-82ce984b436c
2,methods2," For this purpose, four of the recruiters’ sites: Bellvitge University Hospital (Barcelona); Universitat Rovira i Virgili (Reus); University of Valencia (Valencia); and Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (Barcelona); assessed cognitive function and trait impulsivity through a battery of questionnaires and tests at baseline (T0) and at three years of follow-up (T3). During these visits, investigators also collected additional information, such as clinical and anthropometric variables.  2.3. Measures  2.3.1. Anthropometric and Metabolic Measurements  At baseline, and in each yearly follow-up visit thereafter, trained personnel measured different anthropometric outcomes, including weight and height, that were then used to establish the body mass index [body mass index (BMI) = weight(kg)/height(m)2]. The body mass index (BMI) was classified using the World Health Organization (WHO)’s nutritional status ranges [28].",8cc9b147-e9da-4b00-962d-e2f079659de8
3,methods3," Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline, 1-year and 3-year of follow-up to determine the levels of fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin and lipid profile. Insulin levels measured at baseline were used to estimate the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance index (HOMA-IR= fasting glucose levels [mg/dL] × fasting insulin levels [µU/mL]/405.13) [29].  2.3.2. Trait Impulsivity Assessment  This study used the UPPS-P framework [21], assessing five impulsive behavior pathways to measure impulsivity traits: (1) sensation seeking, described as the tendency to seek sensory pleasure and excitement; (2) lack of premeditation, described as the tendency to act without forethought and planning; (3) lack of perseverance, defined as the tendency to not finish tasks; (4) negative urgency, defined as the tendency to act rashly in negative emotional states; and (5) positive urgency, defined as the tendency to act rashly in positive emotional states.",c6dead04-7190-4492-9b19-b6089974df41
4,methods4," Each item of the UPPS-P is rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1—“strongly agrees” to 4—“strongly disagree”. Scores for each dimension and a total score of the UPPS-P were calculated, with higher scores indicating higher levels of impulsivity. Previous studies have shown that these traits share between 6% and 27% of their variance, with negative and positive urgency sharing the largest proportion of variance [30]. The measurement of separate aspects of impulsivity can clarify discrete relationships that might be masked or watered-down when such constructs are combined [31]. The Spanish adaptation of this instrument, which was used in the present study, showed adequate psychometric properties [32]. In our sample, internal consistency ranged from adequate (α = 0.75 for lack of perseverance) to excellent (α = 0.92 for the negative urgency subscale).  2.4. Statistical Analysis  Stata17.0 was used for the statistical analysis [33].",632df52d-7c8a-4152-9147-06f3725778a8
5,methods5," The comparison between the groups (presence/absence of T2D) at baseline (T0) was based on chi-square tests (χ2) for categorical variables and T-tests for independent samples for continuous variables. Partial correlation coefficients (adjusted by sex, age and education levels) assessed the association at baseline (T0) between the impulsive measures (UPPS-P) and the insulin-related metabolic conditions. Multiple regression was used to assess the predictive capacity of the impulsivity levels (UPPS-P scores) at baseline (T0) on the body mass index (BMI), weight and HbA1c measures at the 3-year follow-up (T3).",5054244c-895c-4b18-9c2a-855dac19b2bc
6,methods6," These regressions were performed in two blocks: (a) in the first block, the covariates sex, age, education and intervention group were entered and fixed (ENTER method); (b) in the second block, the significant predictors of the criteria were automatically selected by the stepwise method (this selection was used due the large set of potential predictors and the exploratory nature of the analysis) [34]. The final models generated by the regression procedures were next considered adequate if they allowed for reliable clinical interpretation. The ANOVA and regression models were adjusted by sex, age, education and the intervention group. The level of significance was p < 0.05.  3. Results  3.1. Description of the Sample  Table 1 contains the descriptive for the total sample at baseline, as well as the comparison of the participants with (T2D+) and without (T2D−) diabetes at baseline.",ef82d2de-86ee-49a1-bd22-e00999b606a5
7,methods7," No differences between the groups were found for the sociodemographic characteristics, but the participants in the T2D+ group were older and also had higher levels of HOMA-IR, glucose and HbA1c. Regarding the UPPS-P scores, positive urgency and total UPPF-P score were higher within T2D+ participants.  3.2. Association of Impulsivity with Markers of Glucose Metabolism  No relevant associations were found between the UPPS-P scores with the HOMA-IR, plasma-fasting glucose or HbA1c levels at baseline. All of the partial correlations obtained non-significant results (p < 0.05), and coefficients were within the low-effect size range (in the study, the |R| were between 0.003 and 0.098) (see Table S1, Supplementary Materials).  3.3. Predictive Capacity of the Impulsivity at Baseline on body mass index (BMI), Weight and HbA1c  Table 2 shows the results for the final regressions obtained in the multiple regressions, using the subsample of participants with T2D.",ad05a66e-e263-4c9c-a6ff-6b0b6796e59d
8,methods8," Higher scores in the lack of perseverance subscale at baseline were associated with higher body mass index (BMI) levels at the end of the study, while a higher total score of UPPS-P predicted a higher weight at year 3. Higher scores of sensation seeking predicted lower decreases in the body mass index (BMI) and the weight. The impulsivity levels at baseline were not associated with the HbA1c levels at 3 years of follow-up (mean = 6.74, SD = 1.00), nor with the decrease in the HbA1c comparing the values at the end of the study with the baseline.  4. Discussion  The present study investigated impulsive personality traits in individuals with T2D as predictors of body mass index (BMI) changes and diabetes control, measured by the levels of glycated hemoglobin after 3 years of lifestyle interventions.  Baseline evaluations of metabolic parameters and personality traits showed differences between individuals with T2D and those without it.",463a7db4-c0c0-487a-b47f-015b5d2bfe17
9,methods9," As expected, higher levels of glucose, HOMA-IR and HbA1c were characteristic of individuals with T2D. Concerning impulsive personality traits: although the UPPS scores were sub-clinical in both groups, patients with T2D showed significantly higher total scores and positive urgency scores at baseline. Positive urgency is defined as the tendency to act rashly in response to positive affective states [35], which has been strongly associated with emotional factors [32]. Neuroimaging studies have suggested that emotional-based dispositions to act impulsively are linked to orbitofrontal cortex–amygdala connections in the brain, regulated by dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitters [30]. Individuals with T2D showed impaired central insulin signaling, which has a direct impact on brain dopamine systems [15,36,37,38], indirectly contributing to impulsivity. This is exemplified in the impulsive decision making shown in individuals with T2D [13,14].",7cd8331a-0de2-4330-a203-c97670253b60
10,methods10," According to this view, the current results suggest that impulsive tendencies in individuals with T2D may be particularly affected during emotional states, mainly those involving positive emotions.  When focusing on the T2D group, no correlations at baseline were shown between the impulsivity measures and metabolic parameters. However, a higher UPPS-P total score at baseline predicted higher weight at follow-up. Likewise, baseline scores in sensation seeking predicted a lower decrease in weight/body mass index (BMI) after 3 years of lifestyle intervention. This result could be explained by the link between sensation seeking and behaviors associated with the prospect of reward or novel stimuli [39], including high rewarding foods. Furthermore, a higher body mass index (BMI) at 3 years was predicted by baseline scores in lack of perseverance. This reflects a reduced ability to remain focused on difficult and boring tasks.",957ae54a-b646-4afd-85d2-04938a9a6906
11,methods11," Associations between lack of perseverance and body mass index (BMI) have been described in transversal studies in individuals with obesity [40]. The present results suggest that low perseverance affects weight control over time in individuals with T2D. These findings could have significant implications for T2D management and prevention interventions, since overweight and obesity represent major risk factors for a poor T2D prognosis and the development of diabetic complications [2]. Lifestyle interventions in older adults have shown significant reductions in body weight and HbA1c [41], so knowing a differential prognosis in the presence of impulsivity traits could help in the planning of a more effective therapeutic intervention or treatment.  Concerning diabetes management, in our population with T2D, impulsive traits were not predictors of glycemic control after 3-years of follow-up.",00c0eb83-cb7d-4fb4-bcb9-f8a37074632a
12,methods12," By contrast, another study found that impulsivity negatively correlated with diabetes self-management and positively correlated with self-reported HbA1c levels during a three-months period [22]. However, discrepancies in the results could be related by different timings for the assessment of the HbA1c, with a three-year follow-up considered in the present study. This would suggest that even though impulsive personality traits may correlate with glycemic control, it may not have a long-term effect on the control of diabetes. These results, however, must be interpreted with caution, as our sample presented sub-clinical levels of impulsivity. Therefore, it might be expected that, in individuals with T2D characterized by high impulsivity, this personality trait could have a negative effect on diabetes control. The results of this study should be interpreted in light of some limitations.",57a44fe2-48b0-4021-b41b-2804f4c69668
13,methods13," Firstly, even though the statistical model was adjusted for the intervention group and other potential confounders to diminish the residual effect, we cannot completely discard that these factors are affecting the observed associations. However, it is important to acknowledge that the individuals randomized into the “control” group are also recommended to follow a healthy Mediterranean diet that has previously shown beneficial effects [42,43]. A second limitation is related to the generalizability of these results. For instance, given the samples’ sub-clinical scores in the UPPS-P and the moderate statistical effect, results should be interpreted with caution. To overcome this limitation, future studies in individuals with T2D presenting highly impulsive traits should be conducted. Thirdly, it should be mentioned that self-report measures are not free from response bias, and a more comprehensive evaluation of impulsivity using more objective measures (e.g.",6f27ac4f-0376-4013-a738-4ca80c23706b
14,methods14,", cognitive tests) could be useful to better characterize impulsive profiles in individuals with T2D. Additionally, given that our population represent a sample of older Mediterranean adults with metabolic syndrome, further research is needed to determine the presence of these associations in a younger sample without the coexistence of other metabolic disorders. Despite these limitations, several strengths should be highlighted, including the length of the follow-up (i.e., 3 years) that was conducted in a large sample of individuals with T2D. In clinical terms, these results suggest the importance of considering impulsivity as an additional factor that may negatively affect patients’ adherence, opening future research to the development of ad hoc intervention for individuals with T2D characterized by more impulsive personality traits.  5.",586c7f84-bb43-4d2a-9627-371d11b32bb4
15,methods15," Conclusions  Overall, our study results showed that, in this older adult population, there are differences in personality traits in individuals with or without T2D, where UPPS-P scores, positive urgency and total factor registered a higher mean within individuals with T2D, indicating that higher scores on the impulsivity scale are associated with T2D, and these are predictors of weight loss but not of diabetes control after 3 years of lifestyle intervention. Further research is required to determine whether a clinic impulsive trait could have an effect on diabetes control. ",a88c03f0-8dcc-491f-a491-7aa7df504edf
