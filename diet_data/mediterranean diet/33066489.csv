1,introduction0," The World Health Organization reported that more than three billion human beings depend on traditional remedies, such as herbal drugs and related products, for their primary health care. Volatile or essential oils are usually referred to as mixtures of volatile hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives with a characteristic scent. Volatile oils are produced by certain organs of aromatic plants (buds, flowers, leaves, stems, branches, seeds, berries, roots, wood, or bark) and stored in secretory cells or cavities . Volatile oils are not only popular and widely used in the perfume industry, but many of them are also generally recognized as safe and used in therapeutics and the food industry. Many preclinical studies documented the antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties of volatile oils in several animal models and bioassays (De, 2004; Edris, 2007; Saviuc et al., 2015; Sharifi-Rad et al., 2017).",66b9a7ee-56b1-4126-b96f-3d40e3e35ae0
2,introduction1,"  Volatile oils are known for their antioxidant activity due to their free radical scavenging ability. This activity supports their use in food preservation and for the management of many ailments, such as cancers, and neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and immune system diseases (Pourmortazavi and Hajimirsadeghi, 2007). Volatile oils possess significant antiseptic, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-parasitic, antifungal, and insecticidal activities (Burt, 2004). Therefore, volatile oils are widely used as antimicrobial agents with a high safety index and potent activity against a wide array of pathogenic microorganisms.  Microbial infections can result in life-threatening conditions, resulting in an annual loss of millions of lives. Although penicillin discovery pushed back many aggressive pathogenic bacteria, certain strains evolved and developed powerful resistant mechanisms against most available antibiotics (Fischbach and Walsh, 2009).",93dabc25-7c94-47b2-b52f-aed9f4691dd8
3,introduction2," Natural products were always the backbone for the discovery of new antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial activity of certain volatile oils has been documented in many studies (De et al., 1999; Hemaiswarya et al., 2008; Badgujar et al., 2014; Saviuc et al., 2015). However, published data are scarce on the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of some common volatile oils obtained from Egypt, such as cumin (Cuminum cyminum) and caraway (Carum carvi) oils.  Microbial infection stimulates inflammatory response, and the proper regulation of this response is crucial to maintain human body homeostasis and health. Inflammation is an innate immune response to a pathogenic invasion, infection, tissue injury, or other triggers. It is a complex biological response that includes the accumulation of blood and immune cells together with the release of inflammatory mediators affecting the structure and function of the tissue.",5357b688-6fda-47e9-9147-1dfeec3e1ea9
4,introduction3," Untreated acute inflammation can lead to chronic inflammation, which facilitates the development of other diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune, lung, and neurodegenerative diseases . Human neutrophils serve as the first line of defense against pathogens and are important for the initiation of inflammatory reactions (Pérez-García et al., 2001). Human neutrophils, the most abundant innate immune cells, exert several mechanisms to destroy the invading microorganisms and activate other cells of the immune system (Tecchio and Cassatella, 2016). These offensive features include respiratory burst through the generation of large amounts of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) such as superoxide, degranulation through the release of antimicrobial peptides and enzymes, such as elastase or myeloperoxidase, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation.",eec373ce-f337-4c80-8779-60e086583511
5,introduction4," All these events contribute to the balanced response to infection (Nauseef and Borregaard, 2014). The uncontrolled inflammatory response may lead to the progression of many disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), asthma , psoriasis, or cystic fibrosis . Neutrophils also contribute to alveolar inflammation observed in acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)), a life-threatening complication associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic . It has been proposed that the elimination of elastase-related neutrophil proteases may reduce the progression of lung injury . Also, neutrophils are overexpressed in the severe stages of coronavirus disease thus the suppression of their function may be beneficial in the coronavirus-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) .",dac48e68-9ad8-4ea5-8c9d-dbaaa88144d2
6,introduction5," Natural products have been the source of many promising anti-inflammatory agents , but little is known on the function of volatile oils on human neutrophils.  Fennel, cumin, marjoram (syn. majoram), anise, caraway, and lavender are common herbs, and some of them are widely used in the Mediterranean diet. Volatile oils extracted from these herbs are used for rituals, perfumes (scent), aromatherapy, food, and pharmaceutical products; moreover, all except cumin are listed in the European and/or American Pharmacopoeia (Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products, 2016; Sharifi-Rad et al., 2017). Fennel and cumin volatile oils exhibit therapeutic effects against skin, digestive system, lungs, liver, metabolism, and nervous system disorders (Badgujar et al., 2014; Srinivasan, 2018; Singh et al., 2021).",65e1664e-4435-49b2-a995-f2b954c9fcc1
7,introduction6," Despite their wide use, there is no complete understanding of the bioactivity effects of these volatile oils obtained from plants grown in certain Mediterranean countries such as Egypt. A plant's geographical source significantly affects its phytochemical content and bioactivity. Thus, our study aimed to fill the gap and investigate the effects of volatile oils on microbial infections and neutrophilic inflammation. Other biological activities of volatile oils were also evaluated, such as the anti-allergic, anti-viral against influenza H1N1 and enterovirus D68, antioxidant capacity expressed as NRF2 activity, and lipid formation effects. The chemical profile of the volatile oils was also investigated.  ",82ec1fc2-c332-4988-ab3f-a315f74f3457

Bold values represent active volatile oil samples.  Next, the effects of fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN) volatile oils were examined on the addition of various inducers serving as neutrophil chemoattractants that act via different mechanisms using the same superoxide anion generation (Figure 1) and elastase release (Figure 2) assays. The formyl peptide receptor (formyl peptide receptor (FPR)) plays an important role in inflammatory signal transduction and neutrophil activation (Yang and Hwang, 2016).",1b013f8c-7532-43ee-873e-0556483f0250
50,results12," Formyl peptides have been found in pathogenic bacteria as well as in the human body as endogenous mitochondrial proteins (Carp, 1982). In this experiment, both fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN) were confirmed to have a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both superoxide and elastase release induced by fMLF, an formyl peptide receptor (FPR)-1 agonist (Figure 1A and Figure 2A, IC50 range 3.5–16.5 μg/ml). When MMK1, an formyl peptide receptor (FPR)-2 agonist, was used to activate neutrophils, both fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN) also significantly suppressed superoxide generation and elastase release (Figure 1B and Figure 2B, IC50 range 4.9–22.7 μg/ml). In MMK1-induced superoxide anion generation assay, fennel (FEN) showed the most potent inhibition (IC50 4.9 μg/ml), while the effect of cumin (CUMIN) was much weaker (IC50 22.7 μg/ml) (Figure 1B).",866c0f48-0918-437f-b90c-6a3ffa0f9dd2
51,results13," In sum, similar inhibitory potencies of fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN) on both formyl peptide receptor (FPR)-1 and formyl peptide receptor (FPR)-2 agonists–activated neutrophils indicated a promising anti-inflammatory potential, acting partly via the inhibition of G-protein receptors formyl peptide receptor (FPR). However, fennel (FEN) exhibited markedly stronger effects on formyl peptide receptor (FPR) inducers–mediated superoxide anion generation in comparison with cumin (CUMIN). Interestingly, fennel (FEN) also exerted potent inhibitory activity in IL-8–induced elastase release assay with IC50 13.9 μg/ml, while cumin (CUMIN) was inactive (Figure 2C). IL-8 acts as a neutrophil chemoattractant binding to CXCR1, a ligand-bound chemokine receptor (Lacy, 2006). The results suggest the potential effect of fennel (FEN) in inhibiting CXCR1, unlike cumin (CUMIN).",3846527c-baea-4adb-9a6c-387f5bd6659f

Therefore, the toxic effect of the tested volatile oils could be excluded.

These results indicate that fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN) exhibited an inhibitory effect on respiratory burst and degranulation function of neutrophils but did not exert superoxide- and radical-scavenging or ligand–enzyme interaction effects.  Effects of fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN) on protein kinase (PKA) Pathway  It is known that the cAMP pathway has a negative feedback effect on neutrophils activation (Hwang et al.",82606a93-db3e-43f6-84e4-95f1a4d8b9f1
58,results20,", 2006b). To examine whether cAMP is involved in the inhibitory effect of fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN), the protein kinase (protein kinase (PKA)) inhibitor H89 was used. Interestingly, the protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor H89 partially restored the superoxide anion generation inhibited by both fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN) (30 μg/ml, Figure 5), suggesting cAMP and protein kinase (PKA) were at least partly involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of cumin (CUMIN) and fennel (FEN).  FIGURE 5 Effects of protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor H89 on fennel (FEN)- and cumin (CUMIN)-caused inhibition of superoxide generation in human neutrophils.

Effect of fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN) on fMLF-Stimulated Calcium Modulation in Human Neutrophils  When neutrophilic G-protein receptor formyl peptide receptor (FPR) is stimulated, a downstream molecular cascade is activated via calcium mobilization (inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and PLC pathways), followed by the release of effector molecules. The effect of fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN) (10–30 μg/ml) on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in neutrophils stimulated by fMLF was evaluated. Under physiological conditions in the presence of extracellular calcium, the activation would cause a transient increase in [Ca2+]i until reaching a maximum ([Ca2+]i peak) which subsequently returns [Ca2+]i to equilibrium, usually within a minute.",f276888b-e0ef-4487-b873-557a37034194

61,results23,"  Effect of fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN) on mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK)s Downstream Signaling Pathways  The activation and phosphorylation of signaling proteins, such as mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), regulate physiological functions of neutrophils, including respiratory burst, degranulation, or adhesion. Immunoblotting experiments revealed that fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN) (30 μg/ml) significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) (p38, ERK, JNK) proteins in fMLF-activated human neutrophils (Figure 7). This result demonstrates the inhibitory effects of cumin (CUMIN) and fennel (FEN) on formyl peptide receptor (FPR) downstream signaling.

Phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 was analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies raised against the phosphorylated and total form of each protein (n = 4).  GC-MS Analysis of Volatile Oils  Furthermore, the volatile content of the fennel, cumin, marjoram, caraway, anise, and lavender volatile oils was evaluated by GC-MS analysis, and the results are illustrated in Figure 8 and Table 4. The compounds identification was based on comparison of mass data and calculated retention indices with literature (Table 4 and Supplementary Figures S1–S6). Among the most active volatile oils, the GC-MS analysis of fennel volatile oil (fennel (FEN)) revealed the presence of estragole (84.5%) and limonene (7.0%), while only 1.9% was accounted for anethole (Supplementary Figure S1).",6aa1aafa-f3f6-4905-b162-dd7c92d463ba
63,results25," Interestingly, anethole is usually a predominant component of fennel volatile oils representing 50–85% of the content among various compounds reported in fennel seeds from different sources (Cosge et al., 2008; Badgujar et al., 2014; Murbach Teles Andrade et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015). However, there is a major difference between diverse fennel samples from different geographical sources. Our results bode well with a previous report that identified a large amount of estragole in volatile oil obtained from Egyptian fennel, while the content of anethole was minor . Importantly, estragole was reported as a potential genotoxic carcinogen , and its high content in fennel (FEN) must be taken into consideration for any future therapeutic use.

65,results29," Bold values represent the major components detected in respective volatile oil sample. Estragole in active fennel (FEN) and cuminaldehyde in active cumin (CUMIN) volatile oils are highlighted.  Cumin volatile oil (cumin (CUMIN)) revealed high content of cuminaldehyde (49.9%), 2-caren-10-al (19.1%), and γ-terpinene (9.6%) (Supplementary Figure S2). The content of the volatile oil was in agreement with the literature, while a higher amount of cuminaldehyde and carenal was detected compared to cumin from Syria . Interestingly, anti-infectious properties were reported to be attributed to the presence of cumin aldehyde compounds (cuminaldehyde, 2-caren-10-al) as well as beta-pinene .  Marjoram (= majorana) volatile oil (majorana) volatile oil (MAJO)) revealed the presence of p-menth-2-en-1-ol (24.9%), p-menth-1-en-4-ol (syn. terpinen-4-ol) (18.7%), and γ-terpinene (8.7%) (Supplementary Figure S3).",85fd8ec6-26a4-4a7d-8e0c-6cb06b6213d5
66,results30," In a previous report, p-menth-1-en-4-ol was predominant, followed by γ-terpinene .  Caraway volatile oil (Caraway volatile oil (CAR)) was rich in D-limonene (67.7%) and carvone (29.7%), the only detected major components (Supplementary Figure S4), which correlated well with the literature .  The major volatile of anise oil (anise oil (ANIS)) was p-menth-1-en-4-ol (31.7%), while γ-terpinene (17.3%) and α-terpinene (10.2%) were also abundant (Supplementary Figure S5). However, most of the reports refer to trans-anethole as a major component .  Lavender volatile oil (Lavender volatile oil (LAV)) revealed eucalyptol (syn. 1,8-cineole) (46.1%) as the major component (Supplementary Figure S6) similar to a previous report (Murbach Teles Andrade et al., 2014), while the content of camphor (26.4%) was higher in comparison with the other lavender samples (Bialon et al.",f68994a7-39ce-42ce-803d-d7bb00597df4
67,results31,", 2019)  Although plant species possess a genetic predisposition to produce certain secondary metabolites, the variations in the total content of these metabolites occur at different levels and under various conditions. Thus, the expression of the chemical content of the volatile oils may change due to various biochemical, physiological, ecological, and evolutionary interactions (Murbach Teles Andrade et al., 2014).

68,discussion0," Fennel, cumin, marjoram, lavender, caraway, and anise are the common herbs widely used by the Mediterranean nations in their diet, therapeutics, and cosmetics. Their hydrodistillated volatile oils were screened for various biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities. Several oils showed antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory potential. Their effect on the signaling pathways in human neutrophils was also explored.  In the last three decades, microbial infections have emerged as a major threat to the global health care system with skyrocketing incidences of microbial resistance to available antibiotics. Large pharmaceutical companies stopped investing in antibiotic research because of the rapid emergence of microbial resistance due to antibiotic misuse.",31e650d8-3783-4372-9174-67e3c4c4db61
69,discussion1," Health care authorities encourage scientists all over the world to take the lead and come up with new antimicrobial agents especially from natural sources with potent activity and high safety index. Volatile oils are among the most interesting agents that can be safely used to tackle microbial infections because of their long history of safe use. Aiming to reveal the scientific basis of volatile oil uses as antimicrobial agents, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of some of the most used volatile oils. Marjoram was the most effective against gram-negative E. coli and B. subtilis, and gram-positive V. harveyi with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 128–256 μg/ml. The most sensitive strain to cumin, anise, and lavender volatile oils was the gram-positive B. subtilis. In general, the gram-positive bacteria were found to be more sensitive to natural products compared with the gram-negative species (Silva and Fernandes Júnior, 2010).",9ede4dcb-10e9-4764-a5bd-6858f0f20b87
70,discussion2," Our results demonstrate a mixed sensitivity of the tested volatile oils to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using submilligram per milliliter concentrations. Previous reports have demonstrated the antimicrobial effect of fennel, marjoram, and lavender volatile oils against S. aureus and E. coli at higher concentrations (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)50 2.37–21.3 mg/ml) in strains isolated from human clinical cases (Murbach Teles Andrade et al., 2014) or at lower concentrations (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)50 0.25–0.5 mg/ml) in cultured strains , while all volatile oils were inactive against P. aeruginosa. We observed similar results for marjoram (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)50 0.125–0.25 mg/ml) in the cultured strains. We additionally tested the antimicrobial activity of cumin and caraway volatile oils.

71,discussion3," subtilis (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 512, 512, and 256 μg/ml, respectively). Cuminaldehyde might be the responsible component for the antimicrobial activity, as its antimicrobial potency has been reported earlier for E. coli and S. aureus, as well as other microorganisms (De et al., 2003; Monteiro-Neto et al., 2020). Gram-positive B. subtilis was the most sensitive bacterial strain to the tested volatile oils, including marjoram, cumin, anise, and lavender, and the results were in good agreement with previous literature . E. coli (Anand and Griffiths, 2003) and V. harveyi  cause complicated infections in humans and fish, while B. subtilis serves as a probiotic . Thus, the antimicrobial effect against B. subtilis revealed a limitation to the use of these volatile oils in the diet. Our data pointed out that C.",1b062378-8079-42c7-b530-fdf7f8ae0f45

The immune system represents the most complicated networking structure in the human body, and its malfunction requires potential immunotherapeutic agents for treating specific immune and the associated chronic diseases . Also, in response to infection, a proper regulation of inflammatory processes is needed to maintain the body's homeostasis and health. Unfortunately, there is a deficiency in the safe and effective treatments for neutrophilic inflammatory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , psoriasis , life-threatening sepsis (Bone, 1992), or coronavirus-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) .",717b4c68-dcd9-4a92-bac7-932949f7bf75
73,discussion5," This suggests the urgent need to search for new neutrophil-suppressing agents to improve the treatment of neutrophilic-related inflammatory diseases, including infection-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and lung injury. Human neutrophils serve as the first-line in fending off pathogens. The neutrophil defensive features include respiratory burst with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide, degranulation with the release of antimicrobial peptides and elastase, as well as NETs formation. However, exaggerated reactions lead to many acute, chronic, and also autoimmune neutrophilic inflammatory disorders, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe complication of COVID-19 leading to cytokine storm and even death of the infected patients .",a87d3b9c-c1e9-46ec-b317-48bf3bc2f696
74,discussion6," Up to date, COVID-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) lacks potential treatment; however, drugs targeting neutrophils were suggested as a potential treatment .  The fennel raw material is very cheap (around ∼2 $/kg) (Lubbe and Verpoorte, 2011), and thus holds an opportunity for further development. Reports on the anti-inflammatory activity of fennel and cumin and their major components are scarce. The fennel fruit extract, but not its volatile oil, was previously reported to inhibit acute and subacute inflammatory diseases and type IV allergic reactions (Choi and Hwang, 2004). Another study demonstrated the anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory activities of certain volatile oils including lemongrass, sandalwood, chamomile using in vitro and in vivo models . In that study, Mitoshi et al. reported marjoram as inactive, while caraway as showing a weak inhibitory effect on the degranulation of RBL-2H3 mast cells.",80e6946e-0f64-400f-bdf7-f109257ad61c
75,discussion7," Cumin also inhibited both degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells and TNF-α production in RAW264.7 murine macrophages. We found that none of the volatile oils inhibited the degranulation in RBL-2H3 at 100 μg/ml, which may be attributed to different experimental procedures. Hence, higher concentrations of volatile oils may be needed to observe the anti-allergic effects.  Fennel (F. vulgare) and cumin (C. cyminum) fruits' volatile oils significantly suppressed the activation of human neutrophils, including respiratory burst and degranulation induced by the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) agonists fMLF/CB (formyl peptide receptor (FPR)1) and MMK1 (formyl peptide receptor (FPR)2) in human neutrophils. The fennel volatile oil was particularly strong in preventing the fMLF-induced superoxide generation (IC50 3.46 μg/ml).",bbf75a5c-2a87-4391-9b17-77561a486c5e
76,discussion8," The cytotoxicity and free-radical scavenging effects (acid) (ABTS) and disphenyl 2 picryl hydrazyl (DPPH)) or the direct inhibition of elastase did not account for the observed effects, which indicates to the ability of fennel and cumin volatile oils to suppress the function of neutrophils. Interestingly, a major component of black cumin (Nigella sativa) seeds' volatile oil, thymoquinone, was reported to inhibit fMLF-induced superoxide production, the release of myeloperoxidase, and exocytosis of specific and azurophilic granules as evidenced by the suppression of cell surface expression of gp91PHOX and CD11b in neutrophils . In agreement with our results, the inhibition of superoxide anion generation by thymoquinone was not due to radical scavenging effects (using xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay).",c0aa68ce-6ef9-4551-b760-96f6ad766850
77,discussion9," Both fennel and cumin significantly shortened calcium influx recovery time and suppressed the phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), including ERK, JNK, and p38 phosphorylation, with downstream signaling leading to the activation of respiratory burst and degranulation in human neutrophils. According to previous studies, cumin oil exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated RAW macrophages through inhibiting NF-κB and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) . That bodes well with our results, indicating the suppressive effect of cumin and fennel volatile oils on the downstream signaling pathways of neutrophils and other leukocytes.",e692c275-32fc-4635-bf9d-ae7a5d3f8ff9
78,discussion10," Interestingly, a protein kinase (protein kinase (PKA)) inhibitor H89 partially restored the superoxide anion generation inhibited by both fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN), which together with the inhibitory effect on calcium influx recovery time indicated a role of the cAMP/protein kinase (PKA) pathway in the anti-inflammatory effects of fennel (FEN) and cumin (CUMIN).  Furthermore, it would be worth understanding whether a single component or a natural well-prepared mixture is responsible for the observed effects in cumin (CUMIN) and fennel (FEN). According to the literature, anethole is the most common major component detected in fennel volatile oils and has been reported to show anti-inflammatory effects in vivo using the chronic lung inflammation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) model (reduction of TNF-α and IL-6) (Kim et al.",9103f2c8-1735-446d-a3e1-ff7c0f042568
79,discussion11,", 2017) and the lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury model (decreased neutrophils and macrophages numbers, and the inflammatory mediators MMP-9, TNF-α, and NO, as well as the NF-кB pathway) . According to our results, the major identified component of fennel oil was estragole. Estragole was reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in vitro (over 200 μM) in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells on NO production  by suppressing NF-кB and Nrf-2 pathways  as well as in vivo (30 mg/kg) reduction of paw edema, and leukocyte emigration in the peritoneal fluid . Cumin contains cuminaldehyde as a major bioactive component , which was previously found to possess antinociceptive and antineuropathic effects in vivo (with involvement of opioid receptors and the L-arginine/NO/cGMP pathway) and anti-inflammatory effects on cyclooxygenase and cytokines.",3567cf40-f313-4d4a-96fd-8dc6ac262f38
80,discussion12," However, its anti-inflammatory function deserves further investigation .  Our results implied the important role of cumin and fennel volatile oils on human neutrophils, the immune cells being involved in a plethora of physiological processes, and human disorders. Thus, the Mediterranean diet rich in cumin and fennel might be a perfect measure to counteract neutrophilic inflammatory diseases. The implementation of well-designed clinical trials is required to determine the effectiveness and safety of these volatile oils as drug leads.  Conclusion  Our findings shed light on the antimicrobial effect of commonly used volatile oils. Cumin and fennel volatile oils showed a direct effect on human neutrophils, resulting in a suppressive effect on respiratory burst and degranulation with a profound role on formyl peptide receptor (FPR) receptors (Graphical Abstract). The inhibition of elastase release was comparable to the positive control, genistein.",f48d37b0-6cac-46da-b5e3-65ef1c629d94
81,discussion13," The significant inhibition of calcium and the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) and Akt signaling pathways indicate that fennel and cumin volatile oils are capable of effectively altering the function of human neutrophils. Cumin and fennel volatile oils suppressed the activation of neutrophils and might show therapeutic potential for the treatment of neutrophilic inflammatory diseases.
