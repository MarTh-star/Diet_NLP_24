0,background0," Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has become a significant outcome in assessing interventions in the pediatric population and could be influenced by diet patterns. The Mediterranean diet (MD) pattern has been related to multiple positive health outcomes, including decreased cardiovascular risk and better mental health. We aimed to evaluate the association between MD adherence and HRQoL in children and adolescents. ",a7400d23-2ffe-4322-97cd-a74658921af4

Our included ‘studies' eligibility process can be found in the flow diagram in Fig. 1. After screening titles and abstracts, 116 articles were excluded. After full-text revision of 28 articles, 17 articles were excluded because of the following: they included neither MD nor HRQoL (n = 4), the association between QoL and the MD was not investigated (n = 6), the publication of another study was already included (n = 2), there were statistical inconsistencies (n = 4) and there was one study in which HRQoL presented a value that was not plausible (see Additional File 2).

21,discussion0," Summary of the results  We included 11 studies (10 cross-sectional analytical studies and one cohort) that evaluated the association between adherence to MD and HRQoL in children and adolescents. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe. Of the included studies, only four demonstrated a low risk of bias. A statistically significant positive association between adherence to MD and HRQoL was observed in five of the included studies [14–17, 24], reporting that better adherence to MD improves HRQoL levels. In addition, one study demonstrated this association in all dimensions of HRQoL [19] and another only in adolescents [18].  Comparison with other studies  A previous systematic review evaluating the influence of diet quality and dietary behavior on HRQoL in children and adolescents [25] identified only three of our included studies [14–16], where they highlight that adolescents with better adherence to the MD experienced better HRQoL than those with low adherence.",0c6476e6-4179-4310-833e-0d19e0a1b566
22,discussion1," This finding is consistent with our results, where five of the included studies [14–17, 24] showed that adherence to MD was positively associated with HRQoL, with β values ranging from 0.13 to 0.26 points. Furthermore, in a systematic review [4] that included 43,445 adults, it was observed that there is an association between a higher HRQoL score and greater adherence to a MD pattern than those in people with a Western dietary pattern, who scored lower in HRQoL. However, it is necessary to determine whether a MD could improve the QoL of the child, or on the contrary, adherence to the MD is an expression of the child’s QoL. A recent study evaluated the association of parental socioeconomic status with the child’s adherence to the MD, observing that parents with lower socioeconomic status had children who ate a higher proportion of sweets and junk food, and less proportion of fruits and vegetables [26].  MD adherence may affect QoL through different pathways.",3431be4b-a939-45e0-9f1d-ec5a4d564972
23,discussion2," It can potentiate overall children's health while also ameliorating some pediatric disorders [27]. Higher MD adherence may lead to better physical activity, sleep quality, and satisfaction with body image [28–30]. Higher MD adherence is also correlated with less frequency of functional constipation [31]. Functional constipation is correlated with a poorer QoL [32]. We might think that adherence to the MD mediates these effects through better body weight maintenance; however, a recent longitudinal study in Norway shows that the overall quality of the diet, rather than adherence to a specific dietary pattern, is associated with a lower risk of obesity [33].  Implications for clinical practice  In specific populations such as children and adolescents, the current data come mainly from observational studies as in our review; therefore, RCTs are needed.",1670e365-d50e-418b-8d04-4818877e1907
24,discussion3," Despite this, current evidence suggests that the MD would have a beneficial effect during child developmental stages leading to a better QoL [34].  Improving eating habits toward a MD pattern may lead to greater physical activity in children and adolescents, leading to a decrease in sedentary behaviors and better overall health [35]. Moreover, although adherence to the MD is associated with higher costs in children's diets [36], according to cost–benefit analyses, it is cost-effective in the long term because it prevents future degenerative pathologies [35]. Thus, understanding the behaviors associated with adherence to MD in the pediatric population could be essential for the appropriate and specific design of public health interventions, contributing to the early adoption of healthy habits to reduce the negative impact of Western dietary patterns [34].",6a36b5b8-e476-49e1-85a4-1f54ca6a055e
25,discussion4,"  Limitations and strengths  The heterogeneity of the instruments used when evaluating HRQoL, inclusion criteria, insufficient data, and outcome measures of some studies that were included prevented a quantitative synthesis of the data and the performance of a meta-analysis. Four of the 11 studies have a low risk of bias. Thus, this could be a concern. However, we are confident that there is a true association, given that three of these four studies highlighted a direct relationship. In addition, we only identified observational studies mostly in the European population; therefore, our conclusions could not be fully extrapolated to other regions.  However, this review has strengths that are worth mentioning. We conducted a comprehensive search strategy in several databases without language restriction. This exhaustive literature search had a rigorous selection process for identifying eligible studies using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.",a723398b-7cc4-419c-be95-e96637b02a40
26,discussion5," We also searched the articles cited in the included studies, which allowed us to find the articles contained in previous systematic reviews [37, 38], and others [25].  Finally, this research gives way to future work that will strengthen the evidence regarding the comparison of QoL with dietary patterns and preferences. Since there is a positive effect of healthy diets on HRQoL, several studies relate QoL to domains such as physical activity, school and emotional development, as well as psychosocial life [39, 40].  Conclusion  The findings of our systematic review suggest the positive correlation between adherence to MD and HRQoL in children and adolescents. Future research is needed to strengthen the evidence of the relationship between QoL and other dietary patterns, as well as the adaptation of the MD in different regions of the world.",fd695c17-d8ca-4b33-b67f-dd7d8247e7c5
