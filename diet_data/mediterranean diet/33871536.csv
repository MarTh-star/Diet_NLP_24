0,methods0," 4.1. Plant Materials and DNA Extraction  Seeds of 71 specimens corresponding to 20 different species of the genus Vicia (Fabeae, Fabaceae) were provided by the Genetic Resources Unit at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (in the Dry Areas (ICARDA)) in Aleppo, Syria, and by the General Commission for Scientific Agricultural Research (General Commission for Scientific Agricultural Research (GCSAR)) in Damascus, Syria. Species selection was based on the availability of Vicia species germplasms in the corresponding seed banks. Information on species names and sources of origin, which were derived from the seed bank records, is presented in Table 4.  A total of 5 seeds from each specimen were sown in a 0.5 L plastic pot containing turf (Euroveen B. V., Charleston, SC, USA). Seeds were allowed to germinate under laboratory conditions (21 °C) and grow for 1 month. DNA was extracted from 0.",ae3b8055-d43f-4e14-b792-9498cd54411f
1,methods1,"5 g leaf tissue of each specimen using the CTAB method according to Doyle and Doyle (1987) [70]. The DNA concentration was measured with standard spectrophotometric procedures using the Eppendorf BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). DNA quality and quantity were further assessed with gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Samples were then diluted to 20 ng/µL working stocks.  4.2. PCR Amplification and Sequence Analysis  PCR amplification was performed to a final volume of 50 μL in a Veritti research thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). The reaction mixture contained 20 ng genomic DNA, 1X PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs mix, 0.4 μM forward and reverse primers, and 1 U Kapa Taq DNA Polymerase (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). The primer sequences used for the DNA barcoding analyses are shown in Table S2.",6b7f7ae9-78f4-43a2-b5f6-b58d4d93ee9c
2,methods2," PCR cycling was carried out with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30s, 55 °C for 40s, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR products were sequenced in two directions with the Big Dye terminator v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in an automated ABI 3730 sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequence ambiguities were manually corrected using the CHROMAS software version 2.6.6 (Technelysium Pty Ltd., South Brisbane, Australia).  4.3. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)) Analysis  Species identification, using the sequence similarity approach, was performed using the GenBank database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/, accessed on 13 May 2021). The default search parameters were used, optimizing for highly similar sequences (megablast).",cd69990b-9aa6-461f-a1b9-c845eb80db29
3,methods3," Species identification was regarded as successful when both the species label of the specimen deposited in the local seed banks and the molecular identity according to sequence similarity agreed by >90%. The generated DNA barcoding sequences were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers MZ334891-MZ334961 for trnL, accession numbers MZ338297-MZ338323 for ITS2, and accession numbers MZ285764-MZ285790 for rpoC1.  4.4. Multiple Sequence Alignment and Dendrographic Representation  Multiple sequence alignments were generated for the trnL, ITS2, and rpoC1 sequences of the samples used herein, along with representative reference sequences from GenBank for representative taxa. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis X (MEGA X) software version 10.05 [71] with the MUSCLE algorithm was used for alignment generation. A Maximum Likelihood (ML) fitness assessment for 24 substitution models was carried out for each of the alignments using MEGA X (Table S3).",303e4eda-bc98-4a48-b986-3eae134bf3fc
4,methods4," The model with the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)) value for each alignment was selected to subsequently generate the corresponding ML trees with 1000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA X. The Tamura-Nei (T92) model [72] with discrete gamma distributions (+G = 0.693) was used for trnL, the Kimura 2-parameter (K2-P) model [73] with discrete gamma distributions (+G = 2.119) was used for ITS2, and the Jukes–Cantor model (JC) model [74] with discrete gamma distributions (+G = 0.050) was used for rpoC1 tree reconstructions. The Pisum and Trifolium species in the dendrograms were used as rooting tree outgroups.  5. Conclusions  Legumes, such as faba, peas, and lupins, have the potential to replace animal-based protein sources, such as meat, bone, or fish, as well as provide other important seed fractions, namely, starch and fibre, as raw materials for making a variety of formulated products in the food, feed, and cosmetics industries.",da34b35c-2f22-49ff-a99b-f0b63e839373
5,methods5," Given the importance of several Vicia species in the Mediterranean diet and the value of such ingredients in local Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) products, we implemented DNA barcoding analysis using the trnL, ITS2, and rpoC1 regions to discriminate Eurasian Vicia species. Our analysis indicates that both the trnL and ITS2 can effectively discriminate Vicia species, whilst the use of the rpoC1 region was not capable of identifying most of the analysed species. The use of multi-loci analyses may be more powerful to provide higher discrimination accuracies, especially for the closely related species that single DNA barcodes fail to resolve. Broad dendrographic representations for the analysed taxa were also more congruent when considering topologies reconstructed from the trnL and ITS2 data, in contrast to the topologies obtained from rpoC1.",f4a96ff3-96eb-48c9-ae55-dccef6a67654
6,methods6," We expect the work presented herein to enrich the available barcoding data for species discrimination in the Vicia genus, which will contribute significantly to the resolution of the still inconclusive phylogeny of the genus, as well as for agricultural and culinarian purposes, especially for the local Eurasian communities.
