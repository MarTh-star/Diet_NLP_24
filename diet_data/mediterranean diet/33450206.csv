0,background0," Recent lifestyle changes include increased consumption of highly processed foods (highly processed foods (HPF)), which has been associated with an increased risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). However, nutritional information relies on the estimation of highly processed foods (HPF) consumption from food-frequency questionnaires (food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)) that are not explicitly developed for this purpose. We aimed to develop a short screening questionnaire of highly processed foods (HPF) consumption (sQ-highly processed foods (HPF)) that integrates criteria from the existing food classification systems.

1,methods0," Study population  Data from the PREDIMED-Plus trial (from the Spanish “PREvention with MEDiterranean DIet”) was used. This is an ongoing 6-year, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial launched in Spain in 2013. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the effect on primary cardiovascular disease prevention of an intensive weight loss and its long-term maintenance through a lifestyle intervention based on three pillars: energy-restricted Mediterranean diet (er-MedDiet), increased physical activity (PA) and behavioral support. The study protocol, including study design and data collection, can be found at the PREDIMED-Plus website (https://www.predimedplus.com/en/) and was approved according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of all participating centers.

Details about the cohort have been described elsewhere [32]. The trial was retrospectively registered at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Registry with number 89898870 on 24th July 2014. The present analysis used baseline and longitudinal (years 1 and 2) data from the PREDIMED-Plus study data set dated 26th June 2020 was used. Participants with implausible energy intakes (< 500 or > 3500 kcal for females and < 800 or > 4000 kcal for males) were excluded.

This was done to select extreme highly processed foods (HPF) consumers to further construct the binomial regression model. The final number of participants included in the analysis for the development of the questionnaire was 4400 (48.1% female and 51.9% male, 64.9 ± 4.9 years) (Fig. 1).

Plasma glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol levels were measured following standard enzymatic methods.  Anthropometric measurements  Weight and waist circumference measurements were taken from participants in light clothing with no shoes or accessories, using an electronic calibrated scale and an anthropometric tape, respectively. Waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest. Height measurements were taken using a wall-mounted stadiometer. Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.

Sedentary behaviors were assessed through a validated questionnaire, the Spanish version of the Nurses’ Health Study (Nurses’ Health Study (NHS)) questionnaire [36]. Data about eating habits (binge eating, snacking) were collected within the multidimensional scale of weight locus control questionnaire [37]. Trained interviewers administered questionnaires in individual face-to-face sessions.",e7ff4221-6655-453a-ab90-4313a4307d72
6,methods5,"  Dietary measurements  To assess the dietary intake of participants over the last year, a validated semi-quantitative 143-item food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) [38–40] that considers variations in dietary patterns among seasons, weekdays and weekends was used. Participants were asked the average frequency of consumption of a commonly used portion size (e.g., glass, cup, slice) for each food or beverage item. Nine options for frequency of consumption are given, ranging from “never or hardly ever” to “more than six times a day.” To estimate the daily consumption for each item, the portion size was multiplied by the frequency of consumption and then expressed as grams per day. This calculation was not possible for the fried foods item as the portion size is not specified in the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). To assess adherence to an er-MedDiet, a 17-item questionnaire specially developed and validated for the PREDIMED-Plus trial [41, 42] was used.",441eb3f6-1151-45f3-961d-feddf23e07ec

One point is scored when the answer meets specific criteria defining er-MedDiet, so the higher the score, the better adherence to this diet.  highly processed foods (HPF) consumption and food processing-based classification systems  Four food-processing based classification systems – the NOVA [12, 43, 44], the International Agency for Research on Cancer (International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)) [7, 45], the International Food Information Council Foundation (International Food Information Council Foundation (IFIC)) [46, 47], and the University of North Carolina (University of North Carolina (UNC)) [48] systems – were used to classify food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) items into processing categories as previously described [20].",4b5d26ea-4c6d-4261-9e06-f9d7eb9f41d4
8,methods7," In the present study, highly processed foods (HPF) refers to the following groups: Group 4 for NOVA, Group 3 for International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Groups 4 and 5 for International Food Information Council Foundation (IFIC), and Groups 4.1 and 4.2 for University of North Carolina (UNC). For each participant, highly processed foods (HPF) consumption was estimated according to each classification system as the sum of grams per day consumed from foods in the highly processed foods (HPF) group, divided by the total grams of food consumed per day and multiplied by 100 [20]. The frequency of consumption was directly obtained from food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) answers in times per day.  Statistical analyses  Data analysis was conducted using R programming language [49] in RStudio [50] and with the following statistical packages: “DescTools” [51], “psych” [52], “tableone” [53], “cutpointr” [54], “corrplot” [55], “vcd” [56] and rstatisx [57].",2308f41a-27a1-4faf-9249-925a7d4ab4c0
9,methods8," Participants were classified according to tertiles of highly processed foods (HPF) consumption for each classification system (T1 – low highly processed foods (HPF) consumption, T3 high highly processed foods (HPF) consumption). Tertiles were chosen to capture and show the variability in highly processed foods (HPF) consumption while allowing a straightforward comparison between classification systems. Then, subjects were classified according to tertile agreement for, at least, two classification systems. Those classified in T3 in at least two classification systems scored “1” for tertile agreement, while those classified in T1 for at least two classification systems scored “0”. food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) items were classified into food groups according to their similar nature, nutritional characteristics, and/or form of consumption (Supplementary Table 1).",bb1b1e1b-8fa7-4422-995a-ce25d32dc3d1

To calculate optimal cut-off points of frequency of consumption for the selected items, receiver operating characteristic (receiver operating characteristic (ROC)) analysis was performed using the R package “cutpointr” and the “cutpointr” function [54]. The method to estimate the cut-off points was based on the maximization of the Youden-Index [58].",0662cedb-6f03-4828-9ffa-2814d81c41a1

Cut-off points were adapted to the nine possible answers of the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), so the criteria for scoring were based on a threshold frequency of consumption for each item (i.e., food group). In parallel, exploratory factor analysis (exploratory factor analysis (EFA)) was performed to identify underlying relationship patterns between items included in the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) using the “fa” function from the “psych” package [52]. To test for data suitability for the exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Criterion [59] and Bartlett’s test of sphericity [60] were applied.",33654990-4de6-43d2-8e41-35c3bfe5d8db
12,methods11," The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed without rotation and with a principal factor solution as a factoring method. Factor retention was based on the scree plot and Kaiser’s criterion [61]. Cronbach’s alpha [62] was calculated as a measure of internal consistency of the questionnaire. Using the criteria for scoring, the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) score was calculated for each subject in the PREDIMED-Plus database, and the questionnaire estimated highly processed foods (HPF) consumption was calculated through linear regression analysis using the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) score as the dependent variable.

To assess the concordance between tertiles of highly processed foods (HPF) consumption calculated by the four classification systems and by the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF), weighted Cohen’s kappa (κ) coefficients were calculated with the function “Kappa” from the R package “vcd”. For longitudinal analysis of highly processed foods (HPF) consumption, a linear mixed model was performed using the R package “lme4” and “emmeans” with the same covariates as previous analyses.

Therefore, the higher the score, the higher the consumption of highly processed foods (HPF).",d2487deb-2bf4-4a9e-bfc2-a683275b99e3
32,discussion1," Moreover, this score can be used to estimate the percentage of highly processed foods (HPF) consumption over total intake, avoiding the need to administer a lengthy food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) (Table 4) [63].  The present work demonstrates that statistical approaches such as exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and Cronbach’s analysis are valuable tools for developing integrative tools related to dietary patterns and eating habits. Indeed, analysis of questionnaire items through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) demonstrated that they identified one core construct, the highly processed foods (HPF) dietary pattern (Table 3) [64]. This was expected considering that items were selected based on a positive association with the variable tertile agreement through binomial logistic regression (Table 1). This resulted in 14 questions based on the frequency of consumption of food groups associated with a higher highly processed foods (HPF) consumption.",699f3398-c37f-492f-a6fc-e78c386aed9c
33,discussion2," One of the reasons for this was that, in this way, the questionnaire could identify people with an highly processed foods (HPF) dietary pattern with a focus on the frequency of consumption and not on the specific highly processed foods (HPF) items they consumed, so that the questionnaire could detect different highly processed foods (HPF) dietary patterns. Another reason for the selection of items is that the questionnaire can also provide information on how to intervene to improve health in other populations by identifying the food groups most frequently consumed by the respondent and allowing for customized targeting of the dietary intervention to reduce consumption of those food groups. Finally, this selection was performed to simplify the use and interpretation of the questionnaire. In this way, the questionnaire rapidly results in a score that increases with highly processed foods (HPF) consumption and can be used to categorize the respondent accordingly.",6545e84b-7516-4223-9315-36d443119fac
34,discussion3," Notably, the questionnaire was designed to encompass criteria from four leading food processing-based classification systems – NOVA, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), International Food Information Council Foundation (IFIC), and University of North Carolina (UNC) –, so the categorization as highly processed foods (HPF) consumer occurs according to at least two of these classification systems (tertile agreement) [20]. This is a key asset of the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF), which makes it more comprehensive than other methods that have been proposed and are limited to one classification system [63]. In this regard, the limitations of the NOVA system, the most used classification system, have been widely discussed [65] and it has been shown that the choice of the classification system can have a significant impact on research outcomes [20].",cbc6daa5-7fdd-4dc7-8c10-d415af5c480a
35,discussion4," Therefore, the integrative approach used to create the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) is undoubtedly a critical advantage contributing towards an objective measurement of highly processed foods (HPF) consumption and its association to disease. In addition, a reason for choosing food groups rather than specific food items was that this would allow assigning specific food items to groups in the questionnaire - even if they were not initially considered because they were not present in the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) - attending to similar characteristics than one of the 14 food groups.  Another significant advantage of the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) is its quick and easy administration and interpretation, regardless of the method of administration (i.e., self-reported or interviewer-led).",0eed0ab6-b463-4d35-88af-8d09e2f6f577
36,discussion5," This is particularly useful at the epidemiological level, where a high volume of responses is often collected and the length and subsequent processing of questionnaires is an important aspect of study design [66]. Despite its apparent simplicity, the ability of the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) to classify subjects according to their highly processed foods (HPF) consumption is comparable to other more involved classification systems (Supplementary Table 2). As a reflection of this, longitudinal changes in highly processed foods (HPF) consumption estimated by the four classification systems were also detected with the same significance by the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) estimation (Table 7). Furthermore, significant differences among participants grouped according to sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) scores could be detected in weight, waist circumference, and hours spent watching TV, among others (Table 6).",21e79790-ee50-46c8-ab48-6ec3a708690d
37,discussion6," These results indicate the potential of the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) as an initial tool to evaluate the impact of highly processed foods (HPF) consumption on lifestyle in large-scale intervention trials, such as PREDIMED-Plus. For these reasons, we firmly believe that the consistent use of the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) in epidemiological studies could contribute to a robust understanding of the relationship between highly processed foods (HPF) dietary patterns and health.  The applicability of the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) spans not only epidemiological research but also public health and clinical nutrition. The use of “a priori” screening tools to define dietary habits and patterns plays an important role in developing personalized nutrition advice [67].",b46ca3c8-0e06-4540-9b80-7f9f4d7ff5bc
38,discussion7," Several epidemiological studies have shown the importance of using dietary patterns to assess the association between dietary exposure and risk of developing chronic diseases [14], giving rise to valuable screening tools aimed at large populations [68]. Most of the developed scores and indices emphasize the importance of healthy dietary habits – Mediterranean diet [41, 69], Nordic diet [70], “healthy” diet [71, 72] – based on a theoretical rationale. However, some studies have reflected the need to capture deleterious eating habits that present a counteractive distortion over the beneficial effects of these diets [67].",9b8888d1-b95d-4a43-ac40-30c3a1b50842
39,discussion8," In this regard, some approximations focused on the assessment of positive health effects of the diet have included potentially harmful items in their composition, such as the Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)) [73, 74] and the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (HEI) (Alternate Healthy Eating Index (HEI) (AEHI)) [75] to encapsulate the global adequacy to dietary guidelines. The sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) presented here could thus be a complementary tool that counteracts the analysis from questionnaires aimed at healthy dietary effects. In addition, its simplicity makes it easy to be implemented in the clinical practice, for example, at the level of primary care, for disease-preventing purposes. Furthermore, the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) integrates the divergent ultra processed foods (UPF) and highly processed foods (HPF) definitions through an agglomerative statistical analysis of commonly used criteria, which provides additional consistency to its application.",f70da87b-47b7-406b-8dc7-7c2af3557081
40,discussion9,"  Regarding public health applications, the limitation of the so-called “discretionary foods” consumption has been gradually incorporated into health policies [76–78]. These foods include confectionery, soft drinks, biscuits, snacks, cakes and pastries, among others [76], most of which are considered highly processed foods (HPF) [30]. In keeping with this, we propose the use of the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) as a screening tool to identify trends in consumption of these types of foods in large populations [79], to consistently identify foods that can be targeted in public health campaigns [19]. This will also contribute to harmonizing the methods of assessing government policies addressing the healthiness of food environments, a well-exposed need for the worldwide prevention of diet-related diseases [11, 19, 80].  One of the main limitations of the ad hoc development of the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) is that its reproducibility in other populations is necessary.",4f6b5443-08fa-4fc9-8f69-14c3f6e56f88
41,discussion10," The PREDIMED-Plus cohort comprises older adults with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity and a limited highly processed foods (HPF) consumption, so the reproducibility of the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) in populations with different characteristics will require further validation. Another limitation is that the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) used for the initial development of the questionnaire is not specifically designed to measure highly processed foods (HPF) consumption. However, it contains a considerable number of items categorized as highly processed foods (HPF) and ultra processed foods (UPF) by current food processing-based classifications [20]. These include industrial biscuits, milkshakes, bakery products, cured meats, Ready To Eat (RTE) preparations, snacks, and soft drinks.",39e10f92-3e05-4736-8222-d5a6b814c25a
42,discussion11," Therefore, the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) was constructed so that specific highly processed foods (HPF) are very likely to fall into one of the groups defined in the questionnaire due to their similar description and characteristics to the items already specified in the questionnaire. The use of an food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) has other limitations, such as recall bias that can impact the accuracy of the data collected [40], but its use to evaluate dietary intake in large epidemiological studies is widely recognized as suitable [39]. We aimed to develop a screener for highly processed foods (HPF) consumption, so it could be used as a tool that allowed rapid screening of a large population and the identification of consumers with a high highly processed foods (HPF) dietary profile.",314b603a-f9e0-4cb5-aa67-20571967eb80
43,discussion12," For an in-depth study of the specific items that make up the dietary pattern of each consumer, it will still be necessary to use more detailed food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)s or dietary recall interviews. Different research teams have developed food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)s aimed to evaluate dietary intake from highly processed foods (HPF)s [81, 82], so it would be of interest to compare these to the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) through intra-class correlation coefficient analyses. In the case of a good correlation, we think that the sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) would present the advantage of being shorter and more direct regarding the estimation of highly processed foods (HPF) consumption, which will facilitate the work in epidemiological research and clinical practice.",fe55807b-056f-4cc4-b2a5-72787f8e138f
44,discussion13,"  Conclusions  The sQ-highly processed foods (HPF) is an integrative, short, and easy-to-use questionnaire that can be used to screen highly processed foods (HPF) consumption in large populations for epidemiological or public health purposes. Due to the straightforward score calculation and interpretation, it could aid Personalized Nutrition practice and food policy-makers in the implementation of effective strategies to tackle diet-related disorders associated with highly processed foods (HPF) consumption.
