0,methods0," Plant Material and Extraction of Essential Oils  The leaves of O. compactum were used to conduct this work. The whole plant was harvested in June 2020, wherein there was maximum flowering, from the Taunt region (34°30′0″N; 4°33′0″W). The botanical identification of O. compactum was carried out by a botanist and given a reference DO12/05005 before being deposited in the herbarium. Next, the leaves were dried in the shade in a dry and ventilated area at a temperature of 25°C for 7 days. The extraction of the EO was performed by hydrodistillation, using a Clevenger-type system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 200 g of O. compactum leaves were soaked in 1.25 L of distilled water in a 2-L flask before being boiled for 3 h. The essential oils obtained were dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a refrigerator at 4°C until use.",2d777442-b158-4123-8c3c-6870368ba23d
1,methods1," The yield was calculated based on the dried weight of the plant using the following formula (1):  (1) YHE=M⁢H⁢EM⁢D×100  Where YHE is the Yield of essential oil (%), MHE is the mass of the EO (g), and MD is the mass of dry plant matter (g).  Test Insect Collection and Rearing Conditions  The insect C. maculatus was collected from a sample of chickpea stored in the city of Fez, Morocco. Bruchids were reared on chickpea seeds (Cicer aritinum) packed in glass jars (1 L), covered internally with transparent fabric. The jars were maintained at a temperature of 25 ± 2°C, relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 14 h (light)/10 h (dark) and 65% (± 5%) relative humidity for several successive generations.  Chromatographic Analysis and Mass Spectrometry  Agilent-Technologies 6,890 N Network GC system with a flame ionization detector and HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness of 0.25 m; Little Falls, CA, United States) was used to analyze the EO.",e5d5cd2f-5cd0-48af-9b92-827a49445d82
2,methods2," The injector and detector temperatures were set to 250 and 280°C, respectively. The temperature of the column was designed to rise at a rate of 5°C/min from 35 to 250°C, whilst the lower and upper temperatures were kept for 3 and 10 min, respectively. The carrier gas (helium) flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Using split mode, 1.0 μL of the sample was injected (split ratio, 1:100). The gas chromatograph’s manufacturer offered a built-in data-handling program that was used for all quantifications. The composition was expressed as a proportion of the total peak area. By comparing their GC retention indices, the volatile oil constituents were detected. The mass spectra of each compound were compared to those of the NIST02 GC/MS library data and the Adams library spectra (Adams, 2007).  Antifungal Activity of Essential Oils  Fungal Strains and Culture Conditions  In this study, three filamentous fungi namely niger, A. flavus, F. oxysporum, as well as one yeast strain C.",6cb7196d-2c6c-4dff-86a1-fc846de3d5f6
3,methods3," albicans were used for testing reasons. All fungal strains selected are pathogenic and have been associated with drug resistance (Krishnan et al., 2009; Al-Hatmi et al., 2019; El Moussaoui et al., 2021). These strains have been reported as the main producers of mycotoxins and are among the most contaminating microorganisms of dry vegetables and cereals. Spore suspensions were taken from 7-day-old cultures using tubes containing NaCl 0.9%. Afterward, the number of spores in suspension was counted before being diluted to reach an inoculum concentration of around 106 spores/mL .  Disk Diffusion Method  Assessment of the antifungal activity of O. compactum EO was performed by the disc diffusion method . First, Petri plates (90 mm) containing MEA (Malt Extract Agar) medium were inoculated with 0.1 mL of previously prepared microbial culture (106 spores/mL).",1d3d65d5-bb09-42c0-b8f5-2d6ada0904ff
4,methods4," Thereafter, Wattman paper discs of 6 mm were immediately deposited on the culture media surface after being soaked with 20 μL of EO. Next, the inoculated plates were incubated at 30°C in darkness. Both, inhibition diameter and percent inhibition were determined after 48 h of incubation for C. albicans strain and after 7 days of incubation for fungi strains .  Determination of the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration  In this work, the macro-dilution method was undertaken to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)s of O. Compactum EO . The EOs were immiscible in the culture medium so that their emulsification was conducted using a 0.2% agar solution in order to facilitate germ/compound interaction. To achieve this goal, in sterile hemolysis tubes containing sterile malt extract, broth serial dilutions were made with increasing concentrations up to a final volume of 5 mL in each tube. Consequently, the concentrations of O.",32ca8ef7-8e7a-49c3-ab48-ff65ce2704b5
5,methods5," Compactum EO obtained in the tubes ranged from 100 to 0.09 μg/mL. Next, 100 μL of the media control of each fungal strain was aseptically transferred into each prepared tube except for the media control. Fluconazole FLU (5 mg/mL) was used as a positive control under the same conditions. Finally, the tubes were incubated at 30°C with a rotary shaker for 48 h for yeast and 7 days for fungi. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of samples correspond to the lowest concentration at which no visible growth was observed in the liquid medium .  Insecticidal Activity of Essential Oils  Toxicity of Essential Oils by Contact Test  Contact toxicity bioassays were performed as described elsewhere  with slight modification.",341a5879-683a-4e02-bbe7-47e4bffbbf08
6,methods6," For each EO concentration, 100 g of chickpeas were infested by 5 pairs of insects aged 0–48 h, packed in plastic containers (250 mL) duly closed by a perforated lid, and covered with a thin transparent cloth. Next, EOs were added to the grains using an automatic pipette and then shaken for 2 min. After 48 h of confinement, adult mortality was assessed as reported elsewhere . Based on the results obtained in preliminary tests, treatments at different concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 20 μL/100 g) were performed. Parallelly 100 g of chickpeas infested with five pairs of insects without oils were used as control. Dead insects were counted daily until the end of the experiment. Three replicates were performed to measure insecticidal activity, and expressed as a percentage of the average mortality of C.",326ca128-84d7-4ef3-97ee-d3e2559e5a05

Eggs laid by females were counted after 12 days from the start of experiment, whilst the emerged individuals were counted after 30 days. The reduction percentage in the number of eggs and adults emerged in each concentration of essential oil was calculated using the following formula (3):  (3) PR=NC-NTNC×100  Where PR is the egg-laying or reduction percent of emerged insects (%), NC is the number of eggs or insects hatched in the control and NT is the number of eggs or insects hatched in the treatment.  Toxicity of Essential Oils Tested by Inhalation  In the current work, the toxicity of EO was tested by inhalation against C. maculatus.",1bee84ed-4ea8-4ca6-bae8-1d4766c99b0a
8,methods8," To achieve this objective, in 1-L glass jars, small masses of cotton were suspended with a thread attached to the inside of the lid. Doses of 1, 5, 15, and 20 μL/L air of O. compactum OE were deposited into the cotton using a micropipette. Afterward, ten C. maculates bruchids (male and female) aged between 0 and 48 h were placed in each jar with a perfectly tight seal. For each dose, three replicates were performed. The comparison was made with a control sample (cotton without test solutions).  The Abbott formula (4) was used to calculate the observed mortality rate:  (4) Pc=100×P⁢0-Pt100-Pt  Where Pc is the corrected mortality percent (%); Po is the observed mortality in the trial, and Pt is the observed mortality in the control.  Repellent Activity of Essential Oils  The repellent effect of the essential oil of O. compactum against adults of C. maculatus was evaluated using the preferential area method on filter paper described by McDonald et al. (1970).",6afe578b-9a21-4e57-99a8-45ccfe8cb7e2
9,methods9," Briefly, 9 cm diameter filter paper discs were used for this purpose. These discs were cut into two halves, each with an area of 31.80 cm2. For one of the two halves, a volume of 0.5 mL of each EO concentration previously prepared in acetone (1, 5, 10, and 20 μL/mL) was uniformly spread to reach doses of 0.016, 0.079, 0.157, and 0.315 μL/cm2 per disk, while the other half received only 0.5 mL of acetone (control). Afterward, the Petri dishes were closed with Parafilm for 30 min. Next, the number of bruchids presented on the half of the disc treated with essential oil was counted against the number of the untreated part. Three replicates for each experiment were done under the same environmental conditions as the insect rearing (Figure 1).  FIGURE 1 Repellent test of Origanum compactum essential oil against C. maculatus.  The percentage of repulsion (PR) was calculated according to the following formula (5) (Zandi-Sohani et al.",de32d14a-151d-4ff1-8f42-f5cccfb2454a
10,methods10,", 2013):  (5) PR=NC-NTNC+NT×100  Where PR is the percentage of repulsion (%), NC is the number of insects in the control area, and NT is the number of insects in the treatment area.  The result of the repulsive effects of the essential oil was interpreted according to the classification of McDonald et al., 1970.  Statistical Analysis  The bioassay experiment followed a randomized design with three replicates for each treatment. Results were expressed as mean ± SE. SPSS for Windows ® statistical software (version 21.0) was used to perform the analyses. Data were assessed by one-way analysis of variance (assessed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) to determine significant values. Fisher’s minimum significant difference (LSD) test was used as a post-hoc test for multiple comparison purposes at α = 0.05. The LC50 and LC95 lethal concentrations with their confidence intervals were determined by the probit method (Finney, 1971).",dccb5dfd-bb96-453b-ae44-16378b476613
11,methods11,"  Results and Discussion  Essential Oil Extraction  The EO yield recovered from the Hydrodistillation of leaves of O. Compactum was 4.41 + 0.35%. This EO yield was slightly lower than that obtained by Rezouki et al. (2020). Several factors can influence the yield of EO from aromatic and medicinal plants. According to Baranauskienė et al. (2013), the EO production of fresh plants was lower than that of dried plants. This can be explained by increases in the biosynthesis of terpenes and their derivatives after the harvest. This biosynthesis is stimulated by plant water stress and ultimately leads to an increase in the yields of EO. When the plant dies, biosynthetic activity stops, and evaporative losses of EO are no longer compensated, resulting in a drop in distillation yields . Similarly, Ghasemi et al. (2013) confirmed that drying methods can negatively or positively influence oil content depending on drying time and temperature.",caa9e4a5-5afb-4be3-ae43-17eec29c4f24
12,methods12,"  Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis  Thirteen compounds were identified in the studied EO by the GC-MS analysis (Table 1 and Figure 2). Carvacrol (about 38.73%), thymol (31.46%), gamma-Terpinene (11.11%), and o-cymene (9.07%) were the major constituents of the EO. The chemical composition of the studied oil was close to that reported by several studies conducted in Morocco. The EO of Moroccan O. compactum was characterized by its high content of thymol and carvacrol, which agreed with previous works (Mohammed et al., 2020; Rezouki et al., 2020; Zeroual et al., 2021). The literature has indicated that the yield and chemical composition of EO vary according to the harvesting period, the extraction method, and the drying of the plant, so that our results are in agreement with previous works .  TABLE 1 Phytochemical compounds identified in O. compactum EO.  Peak	RT	Compound name	RI	Area (%)	 1	4.542	Beta-Myrcene	114	0.55	 2	4.936	o-Cymene	212	9.07	 3	6.",78b29628-7539-4c66-8b56-d892cc7c0e2b
13,methods14," The results revealed a high antifungal potential of the studied EOs against the tested strains, marked by a maximum growth inhibition rate (100%).  FIGURE 3 Antifungal activity of O. Compactum EO tested by disc diffusion method against F. oxysporum (A) and A. niger (B). (C,D) Are untreated fungi for F. oxysporum and A. niger, respectively (negative controls).  In addition, the fungicidal effect of O. compactum EO was achieved by very low minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values (Table 2). From this table, it can be seen that A. niger and C. albicans were the more sensitive to the oil since they were inhibited by the lowest concentration of the EO (3.125 μg/mL). In contrast, higher minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)s 6.25 and 12.5 μg/mL were required to inhibit the growth of A. flavus and F. oxysporum, respectively. On the other hand, EO showed lower minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against tested fungal strains when compared to the Fluconazole standard.",23944c07-99c1-4773-aa34-5056ef115287
14,methods15," Our study reported lower minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against tested fungal strains when compared to previous work investigating O. compactum against A. niger, A. alternata, B. cinerea, P. digitatum, P. italicum, V. dahlea, and P. expansum, which were inhibited by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)s ranging from 300 to 450 μg/mL . Another recent study revealed that the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of Origanum majorana L.against human pathogenic fungi, including Candida species, ranged from 58 to 468 μg/mL .

15,methods16," Potential individual or synergetic effects between the major and minor compounds may occur.  In this respect, some works revealed that Botrytis cinerea in vitro mycelial growth and spore germination were strongly inhibited by carvacrol and thymol, the main compound of our Oregano essential oil . In addition, other recent research has found that the high content of thymol, carvacrol, γ-terpinene, and p-cymene is roughly correlated with in vitro and in vivo biological activities . For a better understanding, previous literature has investigated the mechanism of action of EO in fungi. Indeed, the antifungal effect of oregano might be attributed in part to EO terpenes and phenolic compounds involved in cell membrane damage, leakage of cellular materials, inhibition of electron transport, and ATPase in the mitochondria, which ultimately lead to the death of the microorganism .",c790fce6-c8ed-4bb5-a5b7-cff25d6bcd9d
16,methods17," More comprehensive research revealed that EO of oregano significantly reduced the production of the phospholipase enzyme in C. albicans .  Insecticidal Activity of Essential Oils  In this experiment, different doses of Origanum compactum EO (0; 1; 5; 10; and 20 μL/L air volume) were used to evaluate their toxicity against C. maculatus through inhalation. Mortality of adults was noted every 24 h for 4 days, and the results obtained are shown in Figure 4.  FIGURE 4 Percentage of mortality (means ± SD) of C. maculatus adults exposed to an inhalation test of different doses of O. compactum EO.  According to the results obtained (Figure 4), the oregano EO showed a significant insecticidal effect on the longevity of treated adults. The mortality of C. maculates adults increased with increasing doses and duration of exposure to EO. Significant mortality (86.",affdf203-782e-4e47-b255-5fc3d96f3f82
17,methods18,"21%) was observed in chickpea bruchid adults treated with a dose of 10 μL/L of oregano EO after 96 h of exposure, which showed the powerful insecticidal effect of the oil.  In this test, the EO of O. compactum at different doses was applied in direct contact with C. maculatus in order to evaluate their toxicity against this pest. The obtained results are listed in Figure 5. Generally, the mortality of C. maculatus adults increased when a high dose of the essential oil was applied, and/or when the duration of contact with it approached 96 h. Indeed, at the lowest concentration (1 μL/100 g), the EO of O. compactum tested by direct contact caused 80% mortality of C. maculatus adults after 96 h of exposure, while at the same concentration tested by inhalation, it caused only 20.69% mortality. At the highest concentration (20 μL/100 g), the tested oils showed significantly higher action when compared to the control and caused 100% mortality with the contact test and 63.",6384903c-2e8a-4ebb-a078-3ae27f8a16b7

19,methods20," Figure 6 shows that the number of eggs laid is inversely proportional to the concentration of the EO tested. Thus, at the lowest concentration, the average number of eggs laid per female was 26.33 ± 5.68 representing a respective reduction of 85.7% in egg-laying when compared to the control (Figure 7). At the highest concentration, the average number of eggs laid per female decreased sharply to 3.33 ± 1.15 corresponding to a 98.2% of reduction in oviposition. The number of eggs laid per female of C. maculatus in the control jar was 184.67 ± 23.43. For emergence, a significant reduction rate of 100% was observed at the highest dose tested (20 μL/100 g).

Repulsion class: Class 0—0–0.1%; Class I—0.1–20%; Class II—20.1–40%; Class III—40.1–60%; Class IV—60.1–80%; Class V—80.1–100%.  According to the results obtained, Origanum compactum EO were effective in the protection of legume seeds. This EO reduced significantly the life span of C. maculatus adult bruchids, even at the lowest doses used. This high efficiency resulted in a low value of the LC50, 5.53 μL/100 g (contact test) that might be induced by the action of major compounds of these EO .  Our results showed that the toxicity of EO of Origanum compactum increased with increasing doses to reach the maximum at the highest concentrations used. It is therefore appropriate that our results are in agreement with those reported previously , which demonstrated that EO of O.",fab4cbbe-05c5-4131-8520-4c58cef7df7e
21,methods23," compactum applied by fumigation on Tetranychus urticae adults caused mortality of more than 50%.  Several authors have observed the acaricidal/insecticidal effect of other oregano species. The essential oil of O. syriacum is effective by fumigation on T. cinnabarinus (Tunc and Şahinkaya, 1998). Aqueous extracts of O. majorana were also found to be effective against T. Urticae . According to Koschier (2008), carvacrol-rich oregano oils show significant activity against several insects, mites, and plant pathogens. For comparison purposes, species among genus Origanum have shown significant efficacy against several pests of stored products. For example, Origanum acutidens oil rich in carvacrol (87.0%), showed a mortality of 68.3 and 36.7% against two adult insects, Sitophilus granarius and Tribolium confusum, respectively .",bdb5e9fd-b4fd-495d-becf-b56193731a81
22,methods24," Moreover, the EO of Oregano has demonstrated strong insecticidal activity against the larvae of Spodoptera littoralis with an LC50 ≤ 0.05 mL/larva (Pavela, 2015).  Regarding the mode of action of EO on insect pests, a recently published study reported that EO applied by contact on Sitophilus granarius insects, pests of cereal seeds, can affect a variety of biological processes in the insects . According to these authors, Mentha arvensis oils induced significant physiological changes in exposed insects, particularly on vital functions related to the muscular and neurological systems, cellular respiration, protein synthesis, and detoxification.  Conclusion  In this present work, chemical composition, antifungal, insecticidal, and repellent actions of EO from O. compactum were investigated. In summary, the EO was discovered to be rich in carvacrol and thymol components, which have been remained the primary contributors to pharmacological activities.",c550801f-166a-49f2-9c82-e1cc8377e0be
23,methods25," Consequently, the plant can be a promising source of natural agents with various applications and benefits in health, food, and agriculture. For safety reasons, there is a need to better understand the effect of sublethal dosages of EO on non-target organisms.
