0,introduction0,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia affecting a large proportion of aged people in the developed countries, where it represents a severe burden for its dramatic social impact and for national health budgets. The key histopathological sign of AD is the presence, in several brain areas, of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau, of minute extracellular amyloid deposits found in diffuse and senile plaques and around cerebral vessels and of dystrophic and degenerating neurites [1], [2]. Presently, functional alterations and behavioral deficits that characterize AD are thought to result primarily from the presence of plaque deposits [3], whose main component is a polymeric fibrillar form of the 42 amino acid peptide (Aβ42) generated by proteolysis of the membrane amyloid precursor protein (amyloid precursor protein (APP)) [3].",fda04361-6815-40c7-889a-6ca937ca10a4
1,introduction1," Plaque load results from complex equilibria between Aβ deposition and clearance, where autophagy, a lysosome-mediated catabolic pathway responsible for turnover of long-lived proteins and organelles, appears to perform a key role [4], [5]. Autophagy protects neurons against Aβ-induced cytotoxicity suggesting its possible role in Aβ clearance [6]; moreover, the induction of autophagy by rapamycin in mouse models of AD results in a decreased accumulation of Aβ and aggregated tau [7].  More recently, the interest in deciphering the relation between plaque burden, tissue functional impairment and neuronal death has focused the importance, as the main toxic species to neurons, of the oligomeric pre-fibrillar assemblies originating at the onset of fibril growth [8]–[12].",2b1fa6b8-e741-425f-910a-921515c090c8
2,introduction2," Accordingly, the research of treatments able to delay AD occurrence and to relieve its symptoms has shifted from the development of molecules interfering with fibril growth to that of molecules able to counteract the appearance of toxic oligomeric intermediates.  Focusing dietary regimens associated with a reduced risk of AD in the aged population can be useful to find molecules exploitable for AD prevention and therapy. Mounting evidence supports the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet (MD) in preventing age-related dysfunctions, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and in attenuating AD-like pathology and cognitive deterioration [13]–[18]. In particular, MD appears to be effective against mild cognitive impairment and its conversion to AD [13].",64d87d59-2923-4d79-977b-7c8d9d4d2ea7
3,introduction3," Studies in rodents suggest that diet supplementation with polyphenol-rich components of the MD such as red wine and extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) improves learning and behavioral deficits associated with aging and disease [19], [20]. In addition, several reports, including the “Three city study” [21] support a strict association between many protective effects of the MD and the sustained assumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). In particular, a number of polyphenols and secoiridoids found in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), including oleocanthal, hydroxythyrosol and oleuropein aglycone (oleuropein aglycone (OLE)), have been considered potentially responsible for the beneficial effect of MD [22]–[26]. Here we describe a comprehensive study on oleuropein aglycone (OLE) protection against AD in the TgCRND8 (Tg) mouse model of Aβ deposition.",74381c03-ddee-4504-bf7a-18f66cce031c
4,introduction4," Our behavioral, biochemical and histochemical data in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed animals agree with the key role of amyloid plaques as the main responsible of neuronal network impairment in brain [27]; they also support the beneficial effects of dietary extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and highlight the possibility that oleuropein aglycone (OLE) intake may be useful to prevent AD or, at least, to delay the appearance, and to reduce the severity, of its symptoms.

5,methods0,"Ethics Statement Transgenic CRND8 mice encoding a double-mutant of amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 [28] and wild type (wt) control littermates were used following the ECC (DL 116/92, Directive 86/609/EEC) and National guidelines for animal care. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Italian Ministry of Health (Permit Number: 283/2012-B).  Animals The following 2 age groups of mice (equally divided for sex) were used: 1.5 month-old wt (n = 16) and pre-plaque Tg (n = 16) mice, 4 month-old wt (n = 16) and Tg (n = 16) mice. Different diet treatments were equally given to each age group of wt and Tg mice: 8 weeks with a 5.0% fat diet (10 g/day per mouse) either alone (untreated) or containing oleuropein aglycone (OLE) (50 mg/kg of diet) (oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed). We used a modified low-fat AIN-76A diet composed of 50.0% sucrose, 5.0% fat, 20.0% casein, 15.0% corn starch, 5.0% powdered cellulose, 3.5% AIN-76 mineral mix, 1.",3269c31b-32d4-454d-890f-117af2e2b50d

Oleuropein Deglycosylation Oleuropein (Extrasynthase) deglycosilation was performed according to Konno et al. [29] with minor modifications [23]. Briefly, a 10 mM solution of oleuropein in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was incubated with 28.7 I.U./mL of β-glycosidase overnight at room temperature in the dark. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10,000×g for 15 min to precipitate the aglycone. The complete oleuropein deglycosylation was confirmed by assaying the glucose released in the supernatant with the Glucose (HK) Assay Kit (Sigma). GC-MS analysis showed the absence of any oleuropein in the precipitate and the substantially total recover of oleuropein aglycone (OLE) in the same precipitate. A 100 mM oleuropein aglycone (OLE) stock solution in DMSO was stored protected from light and diluted in oil immediately before diet supplementation.",7f22ba85-f00d-4e56-9a64-5195ad03aa17
7,methods2,"  Behavioral Experiments At the end of the diet treatment, 3.5 month-old and 6 month-old oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed and untreated Tg and wt mice were pooled according to the treatment and genotype and behaviourally tested. The apparatus and procedures used for the “Step-Down” inhibitory avoidance test were previously described [30]. The apparatus was an open field plexiglas box (40×40 cm) with a steel rod floor and a plexiglas platform (4×4×4 cm) set in the centre of the grid floor to which intermittent electric shocks (20 mA, 50 Hz) were delivered. On day 1 (training test, TT), each mouse was placed on the platform and received an electric shock for 3 s when it stepped down placing all paws on the grid floor. Responsiveness to the punishment in the TT was assessed by animal vocalization; only those mice that vocalized touching the grid (about 70% of mice) were used for retention test (RT). 24 h after TT, each mouse was placed on the platform again (RT).",2e53f5d5-f529-4917-b81f-590549346bbc
8,methods3," The latencies were measured, considering 180 s as the upper cut-off, during TT and RT. The tests were carried out between 10∶00 A.M. and 1∶00 P.M.  For object recognition test (object recognition test (ORT)), we modified our previously described method [31] using a white box (60×50×25 cm) with a grid floor covered by white filter paper. A 75 Watt lamp was suspended 50 cm above the box. Mouse behaviour was recorded by a video-tracking/computer-digitizing system (HVS Image, UK). The day before testing, the mice were allowed to explore the box for 5 min. A session of two trials (T1 and T2) at 60 min interval was given on the test day. In T1, the time spent by each mouse exploring two identical 8.0 cm side grey cubes presented for 10 min in two opposite corners of the box was recorded. During T2, one of the cubes was replaced by a 8.0 cm side grey cylinder, and the mice were left in the box for 5 min.",94ed968d-7255-48b2-b1d2-e49732ab5a92
9,methods4," The time spent for the exploration of the familiar (F) and the new (N) object were recorded and a discrimination score (D = N/N+F) was calculated. A discrimination score above 0.5 indicates the ability of mice to discriminate between the familiar and novel objects while a score below or equal to 0.5, reflecting a novel object exploration time less or equal to the half of the total time spent between the two objects, indicates memory impairment in this task [32], [33].  Animal Tissue Processing After completing the behavioral tests, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the brains were rapidly removed and divided sagittally. For protein analysis, cortical and hippocampal samples from one hemibrain were immediately sectioned, snap-frozen and stored at −80°C. The other hemibrain was postfixed in phosphate-buffered 4.0% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, at 4°C for 48 h, rinsed in PBS and paraffin embedded for immunohistochemistry and Thioflavin S staining.",d83ff899-a339-4cf0-9406-bc83f7118240

For western blotting analysis, tissue samples were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer, the cells were directly lysed in Laemmli sample buffer, and 40 µg of proteins were applied to SDS-PAGE (10% or 15% acrylamide resolving gel) [36] for electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred onto 0.45 µm nitrocellulose/PVDF membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Life Science) and incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary Ab (see Table 1). The day after, the blots were incubated for 1.0 h with the HRP-conjugated secondary Ab (Biorad) diluted 1∶7500 in BS. The immunocomplexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce, USA) and acquired using ImageQuant 350 system (GE Healthcare, UK).

16,methods11," 6 coronal brain sections, separated by 60 µm interval, from each mouse (4–5 animals/group) were analyzed. Plaque number and total area were determined automatically. Brain regions were based on the mouse brain atlas [38].  ELISA Soluble and insoluble Aβ fractions were isolated from cortex homogenates using a four step extraction protocol [39]. At each step, sonication in an appropriate buffer was followed by centrifugation at 100,000×g for 1 hr at 4°C. The supernatant was then removed, and the pellet was sonicated in the next solution used in the sequential extraction process. For four-step extraction, sonication of the frozen tissue began in Tris-buffered saline (Tris buffered saline (TBS)) (20 mM Tris and 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.6), which contained protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor cocktail from Sigma St. Louis USA).",3c684089-a181-4996-a12e-78f7c77c2b35
17,methods12," The next three sequential extraction steps used 1% Triton X-100 in Tris buffered saline (TBS) with protease inhibitors, 2% SDS in water with the same protease inhibitors, and 70% formic acid (FA) in water. SDS-soluble fractions were loaded directly onto ELISA plates, whereas FA-soluble fractions were diluted 1∶20 in a neutralization buffer (1 mol/L Tris base, 0.5 mol/L NaH2PO4) before loading. Levels of Aß40 and Aß42 were analyzed using an ELISA kit (Biosource, Camarillo, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Few, round-shaped, small to medium size plaques were detected by an anti-Aβ42 Ab in the cortex and hippocampus of untreated 3.5-month-old Tg mice (Fig. 2A). In 6-month-old Tg mice the Aβ load became heavier with a calculated total plaque area in the cortex and hippocampus of about 1600 µm2 and 1400 µm2, respectively (Fig. 2A), which was markedly reduced in the brains of age-matched Tg mice fed with oleuropein aglycone (OLE) (Fig. 2A).",09e8d57b-fc0e-4f9f-bb5b-ab9a8c02adf0
25,results5," Quantitative analysis of total Aβ plaque area and number in the cortex and the hippocampus revealed that the effect of oleuropein aglycone (OLE) treatment was significant both in 3.5- and 6-month-old Tg mice (Fig. 2B), supporting a remarkable protective effect of oleuropein aglycone (OLE) against early and middle stage of Aβ deposition.

Actually, an intense bright and punctate immunoreactivity for Beclin 1, a protein involved in the initiation and execution of autophagy, was detected in the soma, perikarya and dendrites of neurons in different layers of somatosensory/parietal (Fig. 4A) and entorhinal/piriform cortices of Tg mice fed with oleuropein aglycone (OLE) as compared to age-matched untreated Tg mice with no apparent age-related differences.",e122e651-5b63-4593-b94d-4f474581ee3e

As for Beclin 1, LC3 immunoreactivity was stronger also in all oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed than in untreated (Fig. 4C) wt mice. As for Beclin 1, in the cortex of oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed Tg and wt mice of both ages LC3-II levels showed a trend towards an increase in the wt mice and a significant increase in the Tg mice respect to age-matched untreated wt and Tg mice, as exemplified for 3.5-month-old mice (Fig. 4D). Overall, our data indicate that oleuropein aglycone (OLE) triggers autophagy not only in Tg but also in wt mice suggesting a possible beneficial effect of this polyphenol also against age-related neurodegeneration such as that occurring in sporadic AD, with an effect similar, at the molecular level, to that elicited by caloric restriction [43].",3c47700d-1c7d-4b8b-933c-f6bb73952abc

In the cortex of oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed animals Beclin 1 levels show a trend towards an increase in the wt mice and in the oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed Tg mice Beclin 1 and LC3 levels were significantly increased respect to age-matched untreated wt and Tg mice. (**P<0.01). Data are reported as mean values ± S.E.M.  To better assess the protective role of the increased autophagy in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed mice we checked whether it results in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. An intense cathepsin B immunoreactivity was detected as bright puncta in small-sized lysosomes within neurons in the superficial and deep layers of the somatosensory/parietal and entorhinal/piriform cortices of 3.5 month-old Tg mice fed with oleuropein aglycone (OLE) (Fig. 5A).",4ef04697-3bb3-499c-929a-71c0d0ff67a1
33,results13," Significant co-localization was found in these animals by double staining with Abs against cathepsin B and p62, a cargo receptor targeting many cellular substrates for autophagic degradation [44] (Fig. 5A). A similar staining was found in the wt mice treated or untreated with oleuropein aglycone (OLE), independently of animal age, as exemplified for 3.5-month-old mice (Fig. 5A), and the quantitative analysis confirmed that cathepsin B reached similar levels in all these mice (Fig. 5B). Altogether, these findings suggest that the autophagosome-lysosome fusion needed for cargo degradation is under way in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed Tg and wt mice whereas a marked reduction of the cathepsin B expression is present in the same cortical areas of untreated 3.5-month-old Tg mice (Fig. 5B), with no co-localization between cathepsin B and p62, indicating a transgene-associated dysfunction of the autophagic pathway.

Moreover, in wt mice, either untreated or treated with oleuropein aglycone (OLE) (Fig. 5A), and in oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed Tg mice of both ages, p62 immunoreactivity was markedly greater than in age-matched untreated Tg mice (Fig. 5A, C), as confirmed by Western blotting of brain extracts, here shown for 3.5-month-old mice (Fig. 5B). A substantial lack of co-localization between cathepsin B and p62 was found in 6-month-old untreated Tg mice (Fig. 5C).",c890e311-adb4-4e8e-8088-a068efecdab1
35,results15," As shown for younger mice, also in this case oleuropein aglycone (OLE) feeding was associated with a recover of p62-cathepsin B co-localization (Fig. 5C, yellow staining), indicating that oleuropein aglycone (OLE) administration rescues autophagosome-lysosome function also in advanced stages of amyloid deposition.  10.1371/journal.pone.0071702.g005Figure 5 Autophagosome-lysosome fusion in the cortex of untreated and oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed wt and Tg mice.

The time-course analysis showed that 48 h cell culturing without medium replacement, resulting in nutrient shortage, was needed to increase the expression of autophagic markers (Fig. 6A).",640a80b9-1ba2-425c-9ff6-96e1f45926e8
38,results18," However, cells cultured similarly but exposed to 90 µM oleuropein aglycone (OLE) displayed increased Beclin 1 and p62 expression as compared to control cells already after 6 h of treatment. The dose-dependence analysis showed that LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and Beclin 1 expression increased already after 6 h of treatment with 9.0 µM oleuropein aglycone (OLE); 90 µM oleuropein aglycone (OLE) administration resulted in a further increase of these markers together with that of p62 (Fig. 6B). Finally, the time- and dose-dependent decrease of phosphorylation of the mTOR substrate p70 S6-kinase in cells exposed for 3–48 h to 50 µM oleuropein aglycone (OLE) or for 6 h to 9.0–100 µM oleuropein aglycone (OLE) (Fig. 6C, D) suggests that autophagy activation by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) proceeds through mTOR inhibition.",9bf27afb-d2f1-4cbc-a05e-3e1513192ea9
39,results19," The Neutral Red (NR) Uptake assay, which measures cell viability in terms of ability to retain the dye inside lysosomes, is particularly appropriate in this context where lysosome integrity is a prominent feature of functional autophagy activation. No significant differences in this assay were found between control and oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-treated cells exposed for 48 h to 90 µM oleuropein aglycone (OLE) (oleuropein aglycone (OLE) = 99.9±0.9110, n = 4, calculated with respect to control taken as 100%). These data further suggest that oleuropein aglycone (OLE) is directly responsible for autophagy induction, is protective and does not trigger neurodegeneration and cell death as it is the case of several polyphenols [43] and of the prolonged treatment with rapamycin [7].  10.1371/journal.pone.0071702.g006Figure 6 oleuropein aglycone (OLE) activates autophagy in N2a murine neuroblastoma cells.",23d36186-7f96-4edc-ae73-c048a7d8133b

This is a representative experiment out of three that gave qualitatively identical results.  oleuropein aglycone (OLE) Reduces Astrocyte Reaction It is widely recognised that amyloid deposits in the brain activate an inflammatory response that contributes to cell sufferance and functional decline [45]. Accordingly, we investigated whether oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-treatment reduced the inflammatory response in our Tg mice. We detected hypertrophic astrocytes with long and thick branches in the cortex and in all the subregions of the hippocampus of untreated Tg mice (Fig. 7 A). By contrast, in the oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed animals the astrocyte reaction was considerably milder (Fig.",5234186c-a572-4a62-8e50-aae82bc04bf3
41,results21," 7A), indicating reduction of inflammation. The latter was not the result of the antioxidant power of oleuropein aglycone (OLE); in fact, lipid peroxidation in the cortex of 3.5-month-old Tg mice was not significantly reduced by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) treatment (Fig. 7C). Next, we investigated the effect of oleuropein aglycone (OLE) administration on microglia morphology. Surprisingly, activated microglia with enlarged cell bodies, thickened and retracted processes or losses of branches were detected in the hippocampus (not shown) and cortex of oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed 6-month-old Tg mice (Fig. 7B). Such a scenario coincided and agreed with the presence of the less dense “fluffy” amyloid plaques described above, suggesting activated microglia involvement in plaque remodelling and phagocytosis. In untreated Tg mice some morphologically activated microglia were detected only in 6-month-old animals while in 3.",264d6c9b-3b1f-4255-9899-3e45784d2287
42,results22,"5-month-old mice resting microglia with thin cell bodies and elongated branches were mostly detected (Fig. 7B). These data support protection by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) against the inflammatory response to amyloid deposits mainly at the astrocyte level, while microglia activation by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) can mainly contribute to plaque clearance.  10.1371/journal.pone.0071702.g007Figure 7 Astrocyte and microglia reaction in the brain of untreated and oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed TgCRND8 mice.

44,discussion0,"The present study provides acompelling evidence that, in young/middle-aged TgCRND8 mice, diet supplementation for 8 weeks with oleuropein aglycone (OLE) remarkably improves animal behavior in two memory tests respect to normally fed littermates, with scores reaching those displayed by age-matched wt mice. Improved behavior is accompanied by a significant reduction in Aß40 and Aß42 levels as well as in size and compactness of Aβ plaques and by the presence of fluffy deposits in the older Tg mice. Altogether, our data suggest that oleuropein aglycone (OLE) treatment reduces de novo Aβ deposition and favors preformed plaque disassembly. These results agree with our recently reported findings on a recombinant C. elegans strain expressing human Aβ42 in the cytoplasm of muscle cells, showing that worms grown on an oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-supplemented medium displayed remarkably improved motility and reduced plaque deposition [46].",9c200468-c617-47e3-abcf-ad216e96a50b
45,discussion1,"  It has been already reported that the inability to acquire the step down-inhibitory response and to explore a novel object over a familiar one in this mouse model reflects dysfunction of cortical areas [30], [47]; Functional disruption in the neuronal network has repeatedly been reported in AD mouse models [48]. Aberrant neuronal activity and significant reduction of the number of active neurons is particularly present near amyloid plaques, whose presence causes disturbances resulting in abnormalities of whole neuronal networks both in animal models [30], [49] and in asymptomatic patients with amyloid deposits [50]. Our data demonstrating that oleuropein aglycone (OLE) treatment of young/middle-aged Tg mice results in a concomitant improvement of non-spatial episodic memory and working memory together with amelioration of cortical neuropathological aspects and a remarkable induction of autophagy underscores a tight link between these effects.",d954dd67-8875-4e01-a740-a661d80dc999
46,discussion2," TgCRND8 mice develop a pattern of Aβ deposition recalling several aspects of human AD. Small size Aß42 immunopositive plaques appear in various brain areas, including the cortex and the hippocampus, by the age of 3 months. As a function of age, they become small-medium to big in size and acquire a compact core, becoming numerous and reaching the maximum roughly by 7–8 months of age [28], [30], [35]. oleuropein aglycone (OLE) administration with diet to pre-plaque TgCRND8 mice for 8 weeks results in a remarkable reduction of the Aβ load, with a significant decrease of levels, plaque number and area, in agreement with the in vitro anti-aggregation effect of oleuropein aglycone (OLE) we have reported previously [24].",ecae8ec3-37b8-4096-a790-c0751cc6e32e
47,discussion3," In the oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-treated older Tg mice, the cortical levels are reduced and the plaques appear less compact displaying ribbon-like and fluffy morphologies in both the cortex and the hippocampus, indicating the occurrence of dual concomitant effects of oleuropein aglycone (OLE), prevention of amyloid deposition and disaggregation of preformed plaques. It is increasingly recognised that autophagy protects neurons from Aβ-induced cytotoxicity and that autophagy dysfunction is a molecular link between brain ageing, Aβ accumulation in the brain parenchyma and cognitive impairment [4], [6], [7], [51]. Recently, brain inflammation and Aβ deposition following some triggering insult have been proposed to establish a self-reinforcing cycle integrating the amyloid cascade hypothesis presently considered at the basis of cerebral impairment in AD [52].",84be0085-1324-49bf-ae1f-b65fd010d1da
48,discussion4," Deletion of Beclin 1 in mice has been reported to increase Aβ deposits, to decrease neuronal autophagy and to promote neuronal degeneration, while gene therapy using lentivirus expressing Beclin 1 reduces amyloid pathology in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice [53]. Accordingly, we associate the amelioration of cognitive function of young/middle-aged animals and of neuropathology with a remarkable induction of the autophagic pathway in the cortex of oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-treated Tg mice. A strong punctuate immunoreactivity and higher levels of autophagosome-lysosome markers, from Beclin-1 to LC3 and cathepsin B, are detected in the cortex and, to a lesser extent, in hippocampal areas of oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-fed Tg mice at both stages of amyloid deposition, as compared to untreated age-matched Tg mice.",6a90a7c3-ff3b-4366-ad1e-6aa6a571b281
49,discussion5," In the Tg mice, oleuropein aglycone (OLE) administration triggers the autophagic machinery to the level detected in control wt mice and leads to the delivery of autophagosome substrates to lysosomes for degradation, as shown by the widespread p62-cathepsin B co-localization. By contrast, in the untreated Tg mice autophagosome-lysosome markers analysis reveals a clear dysfunction of the autophagic pathway. The cortical and hippocampal astrocyte reaction detected in untreated Tg mice is strongly ameliorated by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) administration. This anti-inflammatory activity of oleuropein aglycone (OLE) treatment is not associated with the known oleuropein aglycone (OLE) anti-oxidant activity, which plays a minor role, if any, in all the effects we have found.",cdec7ada-9998-43d5-b7aa-029582604545
50,discussion6," In fact, the oleuropein aglycone (OLE)-induced migration of microglia to the amyloid plaques favoring phagocytosis of amyloid deposits could maintain/produce an oxidant environment thus underlying the absence of significant anti-oxidant effects of oleuropein aglycone (OLE) administration. In addition, since oleuropein aglycone (OLE) is highly prone to oxidation, it probably loses its anti-oxidant power before reaching mice brain.  Our data strongly support the idea that oleuropein aglycone (OLE) treatment combats Aβ neurotoxicity and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment in our mouse model through reduction of plaque load and consistency resulting from a strong induction of autophagy, concomitantly with a recovery of the lysosomal system (whose dysfunction is one of the earliest disturbances that occur in AD [54] and from microglia activation.",9bf85df0-b696-47cc-bd82-e8244b3e1ba3
51,discussion7," The two responses could co-operate to the final protective effect; in fact, the migration of the activated microglia to the Aβ deposits would result in plaque disassembly and fragmentation; the activated autophagy would complete the protective response explaining reduced plaque burden, dimensions and compactness The beneficial effects of the MD on attenuating cognitive impairment, AD-like pathology and neurodegenerative diseases has been repeatedly reported [13]–[18]. Overall, the behavioral and histological data presented in our study support the notion that the beneficial effects of the MD can, at least in part, be traced back to the intake of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and its main polyphenol, oleuropein aglycone (OLE). We also provide a molecular explanation of the protective effects elicited by oleuropein aglycone (OLE) against age-related and AD-type neurodegeneration.",b9dcab06-72f3-49d0-aa42-fcef5ce9ec51
52,discussion8," Our findings are strengthened by previous data indicating that in rat and humans, orally administered olive oil phenols, including oleuropein aglycone (OLE), its glycoside and/or one of its derivatives arising from tissue metabolism, are intestinally absorbed skipping degradation by microorganisms in the colon, cross the blood-brain barrier and are found inside brain parenchyma [55], [56]. In conclusion, our results support the possibility that dietary supplementation of oleuropein aglycone (OLE) may prevent or delay the occurrence of AD and may reduce the severity of its symptoms.
