Diabetes duration ranged from 1.1 years to 12.5, years with a mean of 5.9 ± 5 years. Seventy-one of them were on Multiple Daily Injections (Multiple Daily Injections (MDI)) therapy and 26 with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII)). The former group used an intermittent glucose monitor (Free Style Libre v.2), while the latter used the Medtronic's Enlite v3. Twelve of these were under Hybrid Close-Loop artificial pancreas. Clinical and biochemical characteristics of the whole sample and the comparison between optimal adherence to MD, and the suboptimal adherence to MD groups are summarized in Table 1.

2,results4,"  The group with optimal adherence to the MD recommendations scored more points that are associated with eating fruit and vegetable, as well as more frequently consuming fish, whole cereals/grains, and dairy products. On the contrary, the suboptimal adherence to MD group lost points by going more frequently to fast-food restaurants or more frequently consuming commercially baked goods or pastries for breakfast, as well as more frequent skipping of breakfast, or eating sweets and candies more than once a day (Figure 1).

3,results5," Regarding glucose control parameters, the mean HbA1c percentage of the whole sample was 7.4 ± 0.81, and the number of children complying with American diabetes association (ADA)'s criteria for optimal control (HbA1c <7.5%) was 53 (54.6%), 33 of them were in the optimal adherence to MD group, while 20 in the suboptimal adherence (p = 0.029). In contrast, only 17 patients (21%) matched the international society for pediatric and adolescent diabetes (ISPAD)'s additional criteria for optimal control (time in range (TIR) > 70%); 11 in the optimal adherence group vs. six in the suboptimal adherence group (p = 0.11). However, time in range (TIR) was higher in the group with a KIDMED score of ≥ 8 (60.4 ± 15.70 vs. 52.1 ± 16.02%; p = 0.023). The venous HbA1c was lower in the optimal adherence to MD group (7.2 ± 0.55 vs. 7.7 ± 0.97; p = 0.05).

4,discussion0," Nutrition has a deep impact on diabetes control. Every patient with T1D, even those with the more advanced sensor-augmented pumps and hybrid close-loop pumps, still need to perform carbohydrate counting to obtain a prandial insulin recommendation from their systems. Indeed, a postprandial glycemia explains as much as 70% of daytime hyperglycemia in patients with T1D and/or with T2D (22, 23). Particularly, in patients with T1D, the postprandial glucose is highly predictive of HbA1c levels (24). It is of the utmost importance to control postprandial excursions since these are considered to be primarily responsible for the increased mortality due to cardiovascular causes, as well as increased retinopathy and nephropathy in patients with diabetes (25, 26). Thus, to achieve near-normal blood glucose levels, control of postprandial glucose is essential (27), particularly among those patients with better glycemic control (28).",1d22e53e-f3bb-4d8b-b053-c8e014c93c7c
5,discussion1,"  Nutritional education for patients with T1D has largely focused on carbohydrate counting (29–31). However, there is an increasing awareness that different nutritional determinants are influencing postprandial blood glucose other than the amount of carbohydrates, such as the amount of protein and mono-unsaturated fatty acids and of total cholesterol (32). Additionally, different food-based approaches lead to improved food choices in people with diabetes, improving other cardiovascular risk factors, although the benefit of glucose control is still controversial (33).  The American Diabetes Association positions favorably toward the Mediterranean Diet as a pattern to be followed by the adults with diabetes (29), and children and adolescents with T1D who undergo structural nutritional training to the MD, to achieve a more favorable lipid profile after 6 months (19).",ad479762-d213-45b8-b258-9370468e83e9
6,discussion2," Despite this evidence and these recommendations, the rate of children and adolescents with optimal adherence to the MD pattern is as low as 10% (34). Moreover, it has been found that as little as 2.8% of European children and adolescents had a high KIDMED score, while as many as 51.5% had a low score (20). In contrast, we found, in our population, a much higher adherence to the MD as measured by the KIDMED score, since 51 of the 97 children included scored higher than 7, and the mean score of our sample was 7.04. On the other hand, the rate of children scoring poor adherence (i.e., KIDMED of <5), was very low (7.2% of participants). This may be because we are located in a coastal location of Southern Spain, where olive oil, fresh fish, fruits, and vegetables are readily available, and the consumption of legumes is culturally high, and where the rate of adherence to the MD is generally high. Indeed, our MD adherence (Mean KIDMED score = 7.",ec0216d7-e433-4a3a-86a9-32ebb1708adf
7,discussion3,"04) is very similar to what was described in the children from Southern Spain school in the epidemiological study by Arriscado et al., who found a Mean KIDMED score of 7.40 (35).  Zhong et al., previously found that patients with a higher KIDMED score had a lower HbA1c, lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, and higher HDL-cholesterol (20). Our data also show an improved HbA1c in the group with optimal adherence to MD. However, we found no differences between the groups in any of the lipid profile variables. This may be explained by the fact that our sample, in general, scored much higher in KIDMED than the study population of the referred study, hence, differences in lipid profile are more difficult to find. However, we did find a weak but significant negative correlation between the KIDMED score and LDL-cholesterol levels. This is in line with the results of a recent meta-analysis of the MD's effect on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.",dc786fea-2a7f-410a-976c-80570f849da3
8,discussion4," The study comprises 22 randomized controlled trials on primary prevention. The authors performed two different comparisons. In the first comparison, including nine clinical trials, they found with low or very low-quality evidence, little or no effect on LDL or HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. Similarly, in the second comparison (13 clinical trials), they show with moderate-quality evidence, a possible small reduction in LDL cholesterol (−0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.27 to −0.2) (10).  As the technology for continuous glucose monitoring has evolved, improved, and spread, different glucose control metrics have arisen, which reflect glucose excursions better than HbA1c. The time in range (TIR), considered as the percentage of time that a patient spends with glucose levels between 70 and 180 mg/dl (3.",7a054d7a-e3a3-47b6-835a-189ef8db768b
9,discussion5,"9–10 mmol/L), provides more actionable information than HbA1c alone, and it has been internationally agreed that the primary goal for effective and safe glucose control should be to increase the patients' time in range (TIR) (6). To the best of our knowledge, the MD's effect on time in range (TIR) has not yet been analyzed. Our results show that higher adherence to MD correlates with a higher time in range (TIR) in children with T1D and adolescents without correlation with increased TBR, supporting the benefit of the MD on glycemic control.  The main differences between groups were that the ones with optimal adherence to MD more frequently ate fresh fruits, vegetables and fish, and whole cereals/grains and dairy products, while the group with suboptimal and poor adherence to MD, more frequently ate at fast-food restaurants, and sweets/candies, and more frequently skipped breakfast or consumed commercially baked products or pastries as part of this meal.",474e93dc-af98-4b08-a6fe-f1b49590bc01
10,discussion6," Of note, these are differences that may well be addressed as part of a diabetes structured educational program in nutrition, besides carbohydrate counting. Moreover, recommendations along these lines may also apply to populations with eating habits and lifestyles that are far from MD, as well as those located in latitudes far from the Mediterranean.  Our study is observational, thus, unable to attribute causation. To avoid selection bias, we included all of our cohort of patients complying with the inclusion criteria, and we found no differences between groups in any of the anthropometrical parameters. Moreover, we have adopted internationally accepted cut-off levels for sorting between optimal and suboptimal adherence to MD, as well as the main outcome values classifying glucose control (HbA1c and time in range (TIR)). To avoid information bias, data acquisition was uniform for every patient included.",d391ea9e-20db-47b3-a9f8-46e21577df59
11,discussion7," The questionnaires were answered by participants before they were informed of the results of the information on their glucose sensors, and data on glucose control parameters, as well as the total daily insulin that were directly extracted from their systems. Since we found no differences between groups in lipid profile variables, such as BMI or blood pressure, it seems unlikely to have incurred confounding bias. To provide the study with some external validity, we have included patients from two different centers. However, both are located closely in the same province of Southern Spain, and this may limit the generalization of our results, even if the sample size is comparable to similar studies.  In summary, our data suggest that children with T1D have lower HbA1c and higher time in range (TIR) when their nutritional pattern adheres to the Mediterranean diet, while the correlation with lower LDL-cholesterol levels was mild.",8b76ed4b-3ec5-4177-8bfe-d725fbca08af
12,discussion8," Increasing adherence to MD may be achieved by increasing the frequency of consuming fruit, vegetables, fish, whole grains and cereals, and dairy products. Further recommendations should be to avoid skipping breakfast and to avoid pastries and commercially baked products for breakfast. It remains to be determined if a nutritional intervention in this way will effectively improve glucose control in those patients with T1D and poor adherence to MD. Our data advocate for such an intervention in a prospective study.
