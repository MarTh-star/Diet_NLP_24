0,methods0,"Study design We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) and the presence of carotid plaques as surrogate markers of atherosclerosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and non human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants.  Study population We selected participants from a consecutive sample of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who had been on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for ≥12 months at the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases (University Hospital for Infectious Diseases (UHID)) in Zagreb, Croatia. Non human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants were healthy volunteers who were University Hospital for Infectious Diseases (UHID) employees or individuals who came to the Department of Radiology and Ultrasound at University Hospital for Infectious Diseases (UHID) for routine preventive ultrasound check-ups.",323c2977-e55a-4366-b085-5dd1856c151c
1,methods1," They were not tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) before the study. Participants were consecutively recruited and enrolled over a 20-month period beginning in July 2009. Inclusion criteria for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients were age of over 18 years with documented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (enzyme immunoassay and Western-blot positive) and at least 12 months of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and for controls the age of 18 years or older. Exclusion criteria were dementia, current acute illness, current use of drugs that modify lipid and glucose metabolism (insulin, metformin, glibenclamide, glimepiride, glyquidone, acarbose, rosiglitozone, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, repaglinide, exenatide, liraglutide, simvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, atrovastatin, rosuvastatin, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, ezetimibe, omega-3 acids), as well as diuretics and corticosteroids.",c2ccb618-5117-4488-b18d-d665cc6c629a
2,methods2," We also excluded participants with a history of cardiovascular disease or stroke, documented hepatitis C infection, diabetes mellitus, and allergy or intolerance to olive oil, fish, or nuts. All participants provided written informed consent prior to enrolment. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of University Hospital for Infectious Diseases (UHID) and the Committee on Human Research at the University of California, San Francisco.  Ultrasound measurements and definitions of outcomes Participants were enrolled and underwent ultrasound measures at the same visit. Measurements of carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) and assessment of the plaque presence was performed by a single radiologist, who was blinded to the participants’ human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status and Mediterranean diet score, using a linear array probe (10 MHz and 42 mm) in the supine position.",9a432608-4717-4827-b1ea-ddd1ff5b6907
3,methods3," We examined the left and right common carotid arteries in anterolateral, posterolateral, and mediolateral directions and obtained longitudinal images of the distal common carotid arteries in which the interfaces were most clear. carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) was measured in the far wall of the common carotid artery, 1 cm proximal to the carotid bulb in the region free of plaques with the optimum angle for measuring at the proximal and distal wall (27).  We defined plaque as a focal wall thickening 50% greater than the surrounding wall thickness, confirmed during scanning by electronic calipers (28). We examined the left and right carotid bifurcations and internal and common carotid arteries for the presence of plaque. Subclinical atherosclerosis was defined as carotid intima media thickness (CIMT)≥0.9 mm and/or the presence of ≥1 carotid plaque (10).",fdde7620-3acd-4616-9f86-896b2359a880
4,methods4,"  Nutritional and clinical assessment Prior to the ultrasound, each participant was asked to fill out a 14-point food-item questionnaire to assess the adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet. The questionnaire was originally developed and validated by Babio et al (29,30) and was used to rapidly control for compliance with the dietary intervention of the Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea (Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea (PREDIMED)) study, a multicenter clinical trial aimed at assessing the effects of the traditional Mediterranean diet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (31). It was translated into Croatian, and completed during a face-to-face interview with the attending physician. From the questionnaire we derived the composite dietary score, dichotomized it at the median, and defined low adherence to the Mediterranean diet as a score of <4. We predefined the use of the median because of our relatively small sample size.",6c158437-abd6-481c-b3b9-c7ac4c742a58
5,methods5,"  We abstracted additional data for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, including medication history, from medical records using a standardized abstraction form. Patients were considered as having been treated with a particular drug or drug class if the drug combination had been administered for more than 12 months. We measured the patients’ weight with a standard physician’s office balance scale and rounded the weight to the nearest 0.1 kg, and the height using a wall-mounted stadiometer and rounded the height to the nearest 0.1 cm. Blood pressure measurements were obtained in a seated position (at the right upper arm), using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer, expressed in terms of the systolic pressure over diastolic pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).",008edbd2-2d09-40f7-b804-3f6ec730696f
6,methods6," Hypertension was defined according to the guidelines of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, that is, systolic blood pressure ≥140mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90mmHg and/or concomitant use of antihypertensive medications (32).  We categorized the cigarette smoking status as current or non-current smoker. Previous cardiovascular diseases (as an exclusion criterion) included history of angina, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and valvular heart disease (28). Stroke was defined by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Classification of Cerebrovascular Diseases III (28).  We determined plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load using COBAS Amplicor human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Monitor Test, version 1.",df5a036c-f01e-40b8-8277-f9f749d7e359

8,analysis0,". Categorical variables are presented as proportions and non-normally distributed continuous variables as medians and interquartile ranges (interquartile ranges (IQR)). The normality of distribution was assessed graphically and by the Shapiro-Wilk test. To compare different characteristics of participants with and without subclinical atherosclerosis, we used the Whitney-Mann test for continuous variables and Fisher exact test or χ2 test for categorical variables, separately for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants and non human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants. The odds of having subclinical atherosclerosis were calculated in crude logistic regression models, which included one independent variable (body mass index [BMI], sex, smoking, hypertension, Mediterranean diet score, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status) and age and their interaction for the whole study population (N = 241).",03162928-7903-4d65-a7d0-bd1e64d460a4
9,analysis1," In multivariate logistic regression model analysis, we included all the above mentioned variables except BMI (non-significant in crude analysis) and the interaction of age with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.1.3. (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. ",d70bd9d4-8605-4bbc-840c-e4967e5cf89a
10,results2," Of 4 patients with detectable viral load, one had discontinued antiretroviral treatment and three had low-level viremia (<1000 copies/mL). human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants taking PI and those taking other antiretroviral regimens showed no differences in ultrasound-measured carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) medians, carotid intima media thickness (CIMT)≥0.9 mm, and ≥1 carotid plaque presence (P = 0.819, P = 0.791, and P = 0.904, respectively).

12,results4,"08 and P = 0.632, respectively). In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, subclinical atherosclerosis was associated with older age (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test), higher BMI (P = 0.051; Mann-Whitney test), and hypertension (P < 0.001; χ2 test). In non human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants, subclinical atherosclerosis was associated with older age (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney test) and hypertension (P = 0.006; χ2 test). Patients with subclinical atherosclerosis had lower median Mediterranean diet scores. In non human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants, 24 of 42 (57%) with subclinical atherosclerosis and 42 of 89 (47%) without subclinical atherosclerosis had a Mediterranean diet score <4 (P = 0.288; χ2 test). In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants, 17 of 37 (46%) with subclinical atherosclerosis and 18 of 73 (25%) without subclinical atherosclerosis had a Mediterranean diet score <4 (P = 0.024; χ2 test).",81f5367d-d59a-49ce-823b-a215f77d081f
13,discussion0,"We found that subclinical atherosclerosis was common both among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants and was associated with older age, male sex, current smoking, and hypertension. Lower Mediterranean diet scores were associated with higher odds of subclinical atherosclerosis. Older human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) were more likely to have subclinical atherosclerosis than non human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals.  Croatians living near the Adriatic Sea have a relatively lower occurrence of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases than Croatians living in the continental area, which has been linked to adherence to the Mediterranean diet (33).",ef410c32-25b7-4eec-b9ee-c2c3de67ea80
14,discussion1," Although it is hard to define what exactly constitutes the Mediterranean diet as there are as many Mediterranean eating patterns as there are Mediterranean countries (33), the main staples always include olive oil, fish, and red wine.  The questionnaire used in our study was a slightly modified questionnaire previously validated in Spain, which is suitable to assess the nutritional habits of the Croatian population living in the Mediterranean region (29,34,35). This brief 14-item questionnaire is less time-demanding, less expensive, and requires less collaboration from participants than the usual full-length food frequency questionnaires or other more comprehensive methods (31). In addition, it allows the possibility of providing feedback to the participant immediately upon completion. It was the key element in the Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea (PREDIMED) trial and had been previously validated against food frequency questionnaires used in the study (23).",3f95a1fa-7946-4305-ac0c-570d72b86b6d
15,discussion2," Full-length food frequency questionnaires usually used 100 items, 24-hour recalls, or other time-consuming methods, to evaluate adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern. In contrast to these methods, the brief tool assessing only a small number of foods measured in servings/d or servings/week enables physicians and participants to negotiate changes in patients’ dietary quality and set goals in easily understandable units (food servings) (31).  In a previous observational study conducted in Croatia, no association was found between plasma lipid changes during the first year of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (20). This association was also not observed in non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected populations (36). In the multivariate model of our study, low adherence to the Mediterranean diet was, however, significantly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis.",aea31d9a-eee3-4852-ad82-94f839655d7a
16,discussion3," It is possible that there is a synergy among the nutrient-rich components included in the Mediterranean diet that fosters favorable changes in the intermediate pathways of cardiometabolic risk (23).  To determine cardiovascular risk among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons, we used surrogate markers of subclinical atherosclerosis: ultrasound-measured carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) and the presence of ≥1 plaque. Higher levels of carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) have been found to predict serious adverse cardiovascular events (30). Greater carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) than in controls (0.004 mm) has also been associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a meta-analysis of 13 cross-sectional studies (37,38).",7d7c9cb2-26d4-4c51-8b88-97412b60f0da
17,discussion4," However, a significant difference in carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) and plaque prevalence between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected participants has not been found (1,18,19). One of the possible explanations for controversial results is the limited ability of anatomic imaging to comprehensively define the cardiovascular risk (38). We found more subclinical atherosclerosis cases in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients than in non human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected controls after the age of 45 years.  The Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMantiretroviral therapy (ART)) trial found a higher risk of cardiovascular events among patients with discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) than in patients with uninterrupted antiretroviral therapy (ART) (7).",a44cb7d3-f897-4609-bfdc-1e2e7fe079da
18,discussion5," This suggests an impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on cardiovascular events, possibly mediated through inflammation and thrombosis induced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (39).  It is quite possible that traditional cardiovascular risk factors are more important predictors of atherosclerosis than measurable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related factors. In our human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants, the factors significantly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis were smoking and hypertension. Smoking is common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and the Data Collection on Adverse events of Anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Drugs study found that smoking was the most powerful predictor of cardiovascular diseases (40).  Previous studies have suggested that there may be an association between the use of PI and increased carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) (30,41).",160748fc-c0cb-4544-a07f-b48c63eec1c4
19,discussion6," One quarter of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants in our study were on PI regimens for at least 12 months. We did not find any difference in surrogate markers of atherosclerosis between patients who were on a PI regimen and those who were not. However, we cannot rule out this possibility due to the small sample size. Therefore, a longitudinal follow-up on our participants is planned to determine if human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or PI therapy is important in the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis.  Our study has some important limitations. First, we utilized a cross-sectional design to determine the risk factors, carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), and plaque levels.",d39e7f39-bc83-48ce-82bb-38888c5867b3
20,discussion7," Given the fact that the effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) on cardiovascular risk factors, such as cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, and blood pressure are dynamic and cumulative, a longitudinal follow up would be better suited. Second, we did not measure biochemical correlates of atherosclerosis, such as total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoproteins, which could potentially have provided additional evidence of the protective effect of the Mediterranean diet. Finally, non human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants should ideally have been identical to infected patients except for the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection, but given the highly specialized nature of our institution, it was not possible to precisely match infected and non-infected patients.",c7d9fc0c-cb06-46b5-8b85-e1c02c19dd59
21,discussion8,"  Our study demonstrated an association of subclinical atherosclerosis with specific and traditional dietary habits, which had been associated with decreased all-cause mortality and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors in prior studies in the general population. We also provided evidence that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with accelerated atherosclerosis in older individuals. These results should be considered in clinical assessment of cardiovascular risk in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients.  Acknowledgments The authors thank Phyllis C.
