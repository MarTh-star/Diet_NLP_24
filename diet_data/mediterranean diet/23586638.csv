0,introduction0,"The androgen receptor (AR) has been a target for prostate cancer for a longtime, however, there are limitations as to why anti-androgens are only effective for a short period of time. First, there are a variety of clinical adverse events (e.g. osteoporosis, hypercholesteremia, hyperglycemia) and second, the accumulating mutation profile within the androgen receptor rendering them ineffective [1], [2], [3]. About 85% of prostate cancer patients will have a favorable response with anti-androgen pharmacotherapy, however, the benefits of anti-androgens are short. Very quickly, molecular modifications occur within the AR resulting in anti-androgen resistance in more than 50% of the cases [4], [5]. There has been significant progress in the development of anti-androgens that are effective in castration resistant prostate cancers including enzalutamide (formerly known as MDV3100) [6].",ab384649-67b6-423b-96ac-c14f681dfa37
1,introduction1," The future of this agent and other similar analogues appears to be promising, however, it is important that additional therapeutic strategies be developed to combat prostate cancer.  The increased proliferation of prostate cancer cells as well as other cancers is highly dependent on increased activity of the endoplasmic reticulum to successfully fold, assemble, and transport proteins [7], [8], [9]. This process is so critical that if not regulated properly cells will undergo apoptosis. As the demand for cellular protein increases, thereby altering ER homeostasis, there is also an increase in “translational sloppiness” generating proteins that are unfolded or misfolded. Left unchecked, these cells would typically undergo apoptosis, however, there is a concerted effort to prevent apoptosis and “re-establish” ER homeostasis. To accomplish this cancer cells utilize a signal transduction pathway known as the “unfolded protein response (UPR)”.",65d28399-7f7e-4df7-801b-e24bcbef5136
2,introduction2," Traditionally, the unfolded protein response directed by proteins that include CHOP, IRE1α, PERK as well as others is to promote cell survival [7]. There are clearly instances where this is true, however, there is evidence linking proteins associated with the UPR in promoting degradation of key proteins [10], [11].  The unfolded protein response is closely associated with degradation of key proteins and represents an important therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer. The targeted degradation of the androgen receptor represents an opportunity to circumvent the traditional obstacles that occur with androgen receptor antagonists including molecular modifications to promote resistance. As evidenced by our studies included herein, we present data suggesting that a significant increase in ER stress occurs following treatment with rosemary extract leading to androgen receptor degradation in prostate cancer cells.",1d1f0dc9-d1a3-475e-8415-116e54a289e2
3,introduction3," This targeted degradation of the androgen receptor appears to be critically regulated by the ER stress protein CHOP/GADD153 and ER chaperone BiP. Herein, we provide evidence that CHOP/GADD153 and BiP activation is essential for degradation of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.  ",a47c5489-ab76-4b15-bb48-22090f3d40ac

These results suggest that CHOP may have a critical role in regulating AR degradation (Figure 6D).  CHOP is a critical regulator in caspase induced apoptosis in Rosemary Extract treated prostate cancer cells Next, we evaluated the role of CHOP in regulating caspase-3 activation in 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells. We observed rosemary extract to increase activation of caspase-3 as observed earlier.",ccd0aedb-af2f-4d01-bee1-9411eba9a678
30,results14," Interestingly, when cells were treated with CHOP siRNA and rosemary extract the activation of caspase-3 was decreased in 22Rv1 cells (Figure 6E) and LNCaP cells (Figure 6F). These results suggest that rosemary extract induced CHOP expression is essential for apoptosis.  Effect of Rosemary Extract on progression of prostate cancer in vivo  Athymic nude mice were administered either olive oil alone or rosemary extract dissolved in olive oil to determine the efficacy of rosemary extract on progression of prostate cancer in vivo. As evident from their body weight measurements, mice tolerated rosemary extract well for 22 days (Figure 7A). Development of tumors was observed at day 14 in both groups of mice, with a smaller volume observed in mice treated with rosemary extract as shown in Figure. 7B.",fcc0eb58-d7b3-4301-b085-0f7369eb3ecb
31,results15," At day 21, tumors in the treated group measured 695 mm3 whereas tumors from control mice measured 1295 mm3 depicting a 46% reduction in tumor size in rosemary extract treated mice compared to control animals (Figure. 7B). A representative image of control and rosemary extract treated mice along with pictures showing different dimension of tumors from each group is shown in Figure 7C. We also analyzed mouse tissue lysates using Western blotting for expression of AR, PSA and CHOP. As shown in Figure 7D, expression of AR and PSA is decreased and that of CHOP is increased in rosemary extract treated tissue lysates compared to lysates from control group animals.  10.1371/journal.pone.0089772.g007Figure 7 Rosemary extract decreases prostate cancer xenograft tumor growth in athymic nude mice.

33,discussion0,"The Mediterranean diet has been receiving attention for its cardiovascular and metabolic health promoting properties [16], [17]. In particular, fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, non-refined cereals, fish, olive oil, and red wine have received the most attention for their health promoting properties [18]. One area that has not received enough attention is the use of culinary herbs including rosemary, basil, oregano, sage, and others [19]. Specifically, rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) has been associated with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Previously, we have reported carnosol, an ortho diphenolic diterpene, to promote apoptosis in multiple prostate cancer cell lines while modulating 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) pathway [20]. More recently, we have reported a unique attribute of carnosol to promote dual disruption of AR and ERα [15].",aae71f14-7454-44e0-b2cf-451dd2e506b4
34,discussion1,"  In this particular study, we evaluated rosemary extract standardized to carnosic acid for decreasing prostate cancer cell viability. The rationale for evaluating a complex mixture of rosemary polyphenols was several fold [19]. First, several epidemiological studies have reported that rosemary consumption is associated with an overall reduction in cancer incidence [21]. Second, the European Union has approved the use of rosemary extracts for food preservation and has been adopted into the EU food legislation [22]. Third, in the United States rosemary has been categorized by the FDA as “generally recognized as safe” or GRAS (CFR 182.10; 182.20). Fourth, rosemary is widely available as a dietary supplement in the United States. Lastly, it is apparent from our studies as well as others that complex mixtures of polyphenols under certain circumstances can provide a multi-targeted effect compared to individual phytochemicals.",1cc28495-06fc-4050-8d8d-6cdd24e8cd15
35,discussion2," Based on these observations as well as our previous evaluation of individual phytochemicals led us to investigate rosemary extract standardized to carnosic acid.  Alterations in the environment surrounding the endoplasmic reticulum have a direct effect on the integrity, structure and function of this organelle [7], [8]. This is especially significant during cancer promotion and progression as there is an increased demand on the protein production of the endoplasmic reticulum to meet the increased metabolic needs of cancer cells. During this process it is evident that there is an increased likelihood of proteins that are misfolded or even unfolded. If left unchecked, these cells will undergo apoptosis. In response, the cell has the capability to address protein instability via the “unfolded protein response” which is controlled by PERK and CHOP, along with several other ER stress proteins [23].",378886e5-8ddc-46da-a875-8e16be744214
36,discussion3," As the cancer cell compensates for this established homeostasis, proteins may fold properly or undergo a controlled degradation thereby increasing cell survival. Evidence by other investigators and ourselves suggests that the use of small molecules to modulate ER stress may delay tumor development, growth, invasion, thereby providing a novel therapeutic strategy [24]. As reported above we observed rosemary extract to modulate ER stress proteins, including CHOP/GADD153. The effects of modulating CHOP/GADD153 can be seen as early as 20 µg/ml of rosemary extract (40% carnosic acid) which approximates to 24 µM of carnosic acid. Based on previous reports of the pharmacokinetic parameters of carnosic acid it would appear that these concentrations are achievable following oral administration [25], however, further work would be required to determine the pharmacokinetic profile in mice [26].",51ab321e-9e09-4446-8352-2cd382f9d4f5
37,discussion4,"  On another front in prostate cancer control it is well known that the androgen receptor has been a target for prostate cancer for a long time. It is becoming increasingly clear that there is a significant shortcoming with targeting the androgen receptor with traditional ligand binding receptor antagonists. First, the role of anti-androgens is often limited because androgen antagonists (e.g. flutamide and bicalutamide) are used to control the initial prostate cancer “flare” [27]. This is often followed by an eventual conversion of prostate cancer to a castration resistant form. The response of the cancer cell to “resist” anti-androgens is correlated with mutations in the androgen receptor that render traditional anti-androgen antagonists ineffective or even counter-productive.",6912df7d-6743-4931-a17d-8deb84adecd1
38,discussion5,"  The evidence is overwhelming that the androgen receptor is a valuable target for prostate cancer, however, an alternative strategy should be explored to disrupt the androgen receptor as opposed to traditional antagonists at the ligand binding domain. One approach that has been proposed is targeted degradation of the androgen receptor, however, at present these chemicals are too toxic for in vivo studies. In our study we observed rosemary extract to decrease androgen receptor protein expression at concentrations as low as 20 µg/mL (∼ 24 µM of carnosic acid). Furthermore we observed a significant decrease in secreted prostate specific antigen in LNCaP cells from 11.5 to 2 ng/ml with rosemary extract treatment. The next step was to determine if there was a link between CHOP/GADD153 and decreased androgen receptor with rosemary extract treatment.",4e6a9a39-4fd5-4451-895a-4bd939b4c259
39,discussion6," In both 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells we observed a significant increase in CHOP, however, using siRNA along with rosemary extract treatment we observed a reversal of rosemary extract induced androgen receptor degradation. However, given that CHOP is generally considered a downstream event in the ER stress response as it closely regulates the anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins we wanted to evaluate proteins earlier in the ER stress response. Next, we performed siRNA with BiP, an ER stress chaperone, with or without rosemary extract. Interestingly, when cells were treated with BiP siRNA and rosemary extract a reversal of the AR degradation is observed. In regard, to the function of BiP it will go through multiple cycles of binding and releasing a substrate protein through an ATP driven process that will allow the substrate to fold properly [28].",a1ecfdef-7727-4558-b34d-67267ab77992
40,discussion7," Under those conditions protein disulfide isomerase (protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)) is recruited to reduce, rearrange, and oxidize disulfide bonds until the correct conformation is achieved. Interestingly, prolonged binding of BiP to a protein has been shown to result in proteasomal degradation [29]. Another interesting observation of BiP by others has shown it to be a key regulator of translocon pores in the endoplasmic reticulum [28]. Future work will need to evaluate if rosemary extract is responsible for governing the pore and/or ushering proteins to the proteasome.  Two benign primary PrE cell lines were evaluated to understand if a bisphasic response in ER stress modulation would be observed. In these cells significant upregulation of PERK was observed suggesting that these cells, although from benign regions of the prostate, are at a critical turning point in the carcinogenic process possible as a result of age or field effects [13].",bee73a81-f556-4eb7-9961-f72f30e85a32
41,discussion8," These PrE cells also do not express androgen receptor, which may contribute to the differential response to rosemary extract, resulting in a decrease in PERK expression. This biphasic response further illustrates the complexity of ER stress during prostate carcinogenesis. It is clear that rosemary is an abundant source of a variety of different polyphenolic substances that are different than other well-known natural products and will require a more detailed understanding of how these chemical constituents can contribute to ER stress and androgen receptor degradation [20], [30].  The accumulation of mutations in “normal” cells results in an inability to overcome traditional checkpoints is critical in prostate carcinogenesis. Based on the results described above further work is needed to understand how the individual phytochemicals in rosemary modulate critical targets that regulate the cell cycle and endoplasmic reticulum stress.",69d1c01c-cfe3-47e5-8eab-58b1c8921945
42,discussion9," Especially within prostate cancer it is evident that the androgen receptor which acts as a transcription factor for over 800 genes is a critical component of this process. For this reason, the androgen receptor has been aggressively targeted through androgen receptor antagonists, however, a new approach may be needed to overcome the traditional obstacles that present themselves shortly after therapy initiation. In our studies, we observed rosemary extract to selectively induce ER stress proteins and provide evidence that CHOP/GADD153/BIP is a critical pathway of androgen receptor degradation. Furthermore, these results were also observed in 22Rv1 xenograft mouse tissues following oral administration of rosemary extract. Interestingly, in normal prostate epithelial cells procured from patients at high risk of developing prostate cancer rosemary extract standardized to carnosic acid is observed to decrease ER stress.",7bff4a11-f4e0-4de2-8a39-e374ec0b7d54
43,discussion10, Further work will be required to evaluate individual diterpenes in modulating ER stress proteins in prostate cancer to further understand how rosemary extract promotes ER stress.  We would like to thank Brittany Mihelich for preparation of the prostate epithelial cells. =,c2bf4aa8-92db-440e-a4ac-b084d0cfe081
