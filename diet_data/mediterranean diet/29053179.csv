Mice were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle until they reached the age of 12 months. Young (3 months old) NMRI mice served as the control group. Mice were fed with a well-proven C1000 standardized diet (Altromin, Lage, Germany), C1000 containing vitamin A (2500 IU/kg), vitamin E (20 mg/kg), and selenium (150 mcg/kg) [29, 30]. The verum group received the identical diet supplemented with a blend of highly purified secoiridoid polyphenols for 6 months. Based on the average food consumption, a daily intake of 13.75 mg purified olive secoiridoids (POS)/kg b.w. was calculated.

Effect of Long-Term purified olive secoiridoids (POS) Treatment on Brain ATP Levels Basal ATP levels were measured in dissociated brain cells (DBCs) of young, aged, and purified olive secoiridoids (POS)-treated mice.

Long-term purified olive secoiridoids (POS) treatment resulted in a slight increase of ATP concentrations after sodium nitroprusside (SNP) insult which did not reach a level of significance (Figure 5(b)). To confirm the effects of purified olive secoiridoids (POS) on ATP levels in vitro, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with different concentrations of purified olive secoiridoids (POS). A purified olive secoiridoids (POS) concentration of already 0.1 nM significantly enhanced basal ATP levels (Figure 6(a)). At this concentration, SH-SY5Y cells were also protected from nitrosative stress induced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (Figure 6(b) and Table 3).

15,methods15," Discussion In the current study, the effects of long-term feeding of a blend with highly purified olive secoiridoids on cognition and brain ATP levels were tested in aged female NMRI mice. This strain represents a well-established model for aging studies [30, 38–40]. The results show that a diet rich in purified olive polyphenols has positive long-term effects on cognition and energy metabolism in the brain of aged mice.  4.1. Cognitive Performance in Aged and purified olive secoiridoids (POS)-Treated NMRI Mice Aged NMRI mice showed deficits in spatial working memory and mobility which is in agreement with earlier studies [30, 38, 41]. Our findings indicated beneficial effects of purified olive secoiridoids (POS) on spatial learning memory and mobility. In agreement with our findings, administration of olive polyphenols has been associated with the improvement of cognitive functions [26, 42, 43].  Pitozzi et al.",69a70a4e-a84e-493c-b9d7-6fb2ec747b56
16,methods16," investigated the effects of long-term dietary administration of extra virgin olive oils (EVOO) rich in polyphenols in aged C57Bl/6J mice [43]. Comparable to our study, mice were fed from middle age to senescence (total polyphenol dose/day of 6 mg/kg b.w.), and results showed improved contextual memory and prevention of the age-related impairment in motor coordination [43]. extra virgin olive oils (EVOO) containing different concentrations of polyphenols (e.g., tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, verbascoside, and oleuropein di-aldehyde) induced similar beneficial effects at a comparable dose as pure oleuropein [42]. Synaptophysin 1 (Syp1) and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) are involved in neuronal plasticity and cognition [44, 45]. However, mice lacking SYP1 show significantly reduced learning behavior [46], and enriched environment has been reported to have positive effects on SYP1 brain levels [47].",3ea9d861-4a31-4646-8cc4-4990b9ae0d5f
17,methods17," GAP43 is a nervous tissue-specific protein and is mainly involved in development and axonal remodelling in adult brains [48]. Recently, we have reported that mRNA levels of those two proteins were significantly decreased in the brains of aged NMRI mice [49], which is confirmed by our recent data. These findings indicate less synaptic plasticity and remodelling in the brains of aged NMRI mice which might be responsible for age-related cognitive decline in memory and motor performance [50, 51].  4.2. Brain ATP Levels in Aged and purified olive secoiridoids (POS)-Treated NMRI Mice The high-energy compound ATP is the key energy source in eukaryotic cells, which is mainly generated in the mitochondria by oxidative phosphorylation (of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)).",f6092eeb-7e63-4c5c-8f64-c8b4c417a2d2
18,methods18," The mammalian of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system comprises five large complexes (including NADH oxidoreductase, succinate reductase, cytochrome c oxidoreductase, cytochrome c reductase, and ATP synthase) at the inner mitochondrial membrane [52]. In DBCs isolated from the brains of aged NMRI mice, significantly lower ATP level was determined compared to that of young controls. This finding is in agreement with earlier reports relating lower ATP levels to an impairment of CI and Complex IV (CIV) of the of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system [30, 49, 53, 54]. Accordingly, our current data show significantly decreased expression levels of CI and Complex IV (CIV) which also have been reported recently [30]. Long-term treatment with purified olive secoiridoids (POS) significantly improved ATP levels in the DBC of aged NMRI mice, an effect that has not been reported yet for olive polyphenols in vivo.",adfbdc20-b755-4e86-96f2-e08b2c54a5f1
19,methods19," purified olive secoiridoids (POS) also improved ATP levels in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. Recent studies indicate that a mixture of 6 polyphenols (tannic acid, resveratrol, quercetin, rutin, gallic acid, and morin) is able to increase ATP levels during age-related hearing loss [55] in female rats and in the brains of a transgenic mouse model of AD [56]. In a previous study, we showed that short-term administration of hydroxytyrosol-rich olive mill waste water extract (hydroxytyrosol rich olive mill waste water extract (HTRE)) to NMRI mice significantly enhanced the mitochondrial membrane potential in DBC isolated from treated mice [23]. In the same study, DBCs were treated with hydroxytyrosol rich olive mill waste water extract (HTRE) in vitro, and a concentration-dependent improvement of the MMP was detected. In this study, ATP levels were not determined. However, the MMP is the driving force for complex V of the mitochondrial respiration chain (CV; F0/F1-ATPase) to generate ATP [52].",b09b1e7e-449c-44ea-aaad-34536d919bb6
20,methods20," In a following study, hydroxytyrosol rich olive mill waste water extract (HTRE) was tested in PC12 cells and hydroxytyrosol rich olive mill waste water extract (HTRE) or purified hydroxytyrosol (HT) neither improved MMP nor ATP levels, indicating a different mode of action for purified olive secoiridoids (POS) and hydroxytyrosol rich olive mill waste water extract (HTRE). However, both hydroxytyrosol rich olive mill waste water extract (HTRE) and HT protected MMP and ATP levels in PC12 cells from nitrosative stress in a concentration-dependent manner [57]. In the current study, we only detected a numerical increase of ATP levels after sodium nitroprusside (SNP) insult in DBCs isolated from the brains of purified olive secoiridoids (POS)-treated mice. This result also indicates that purified olive secoiridoids (POS) did not provide antioxidative properties in our current study.",73dd8322-4207-42a2-aed2-66529ec3f5e2
21,methods21," Accordingly, purified olive secoiridoids (POS) did not improve mRNA levels and enzyme activity of GPx-1, which is involved in the endogenous response against oxidative stress in the central nervous system [58]. Sirt1 and activated protein kinases (AMPK) are important players in mitochondrial biogenesis since they activate peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC1-α) [59]. PGC1α itself is activated by deacetylation via sirtuins (sirtuins (SIRT)) and phosphorylation via AMP-activated protein kinases (activated protein kinases (AMPK)). Furthermore, phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)) can induce gene expression of PGC1α. PGC1α facilitates the expression of transcription factors nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) which in turn induces mitochondrial biogenesis.",e0600621-d315-4f69-9a5c-d84dcc50fc26
22,methods22," purified olive secoiridoids (POS) treatment did not influence the expression levels of Sirt1 and activated protein kinases (AMPK). Additionally, we measured citrate synthase activity in isolated mitochondria which is a marker for the determination of mitochondrial content [60]. Significant lower citrate synthase (CS) mRNA expression was determined in the brains of aged and aged + purified olive secoiridoids (POS)-fed NMRI mice whereas CS in isolated mitochondria was unaffected (Table 5) indicating that other molecular mechanisms were responsible for the improvement of cognition. Possibly, the increased ATP levels and the resulting improvement of cognition are a consequence of an enhanced glycolysis which supports important functions such as neuroprotection and dramatically decreases with age [61]. Typically, glucose-6-phosphatase converts glucose into pyruvate which generates two molecules of ATP.",eb7c967a-4fc0-4c8a-a952-ba22d645b92a
23,methods23," Thus, future studies should determine the levels of glucose, lactate, glucose-6-phosphatase, and pyruvate to confirm this hypothesis.  5. Conclusion Long-term feeding of a blend containing highly purified secoiridoid polyphenols (purified olive secoiridoids (POS)) provided beneficial effects on spatial working memory and motor coordination which were probably mediated by the increased ATP brain levels. Therefore, purified olive secoiridoids (POS) might represent a suitable nutraceutical for age-related cognitive decline. ",438a31e9-8b73-4a60-bbc1-ee1bff83a7da
