5,discussion0," Figure 2 below shows the Mediterranean diet food pyramid with daily, weekly, and monthly consumptions [5].  Figure 2 Mediterranean diet pyramid  Daily  The daily servings consist of high consumption of non-refined cereals and grain products, and vegetables and fruits, along with pulses, legumes, and nuts [9]. Olive oil is the main lipid and considered an essential part of the Mediterranean diet. Also, salt intake is limited by replacing herbs and spices at the table [7]. Besides, adequate water intake, approximately six glasses, is ideal, along with wine in moderation. The consumption of red wine with meals dates back to the traditional Mediterranean diet of the European region [7].  Weekly  Eggs, poultry, and fish are limited to weekly intake, with fish having the highest recommended servings of five or six. Sweets are often limited to a maximum of two servings in the week.",dba491cc-3a7b-4557-b66a-109e5093f741
6,discussion1,"  Monthly  The Mediterranean diet also focuses on reducing red meat consumption, with only four servings per month [10]. As mentioned above, the main focus of fat is switched over to olive oil. Hence, red meat intake is significantly decreased.  Olive oil and the role of monounsaturated fat  Olive oil is the most representative group of the Mediterranean diet, and oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid (monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)), is a major component of this essential dietary fat [5]. monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)s have numerous beneficial effects, including healthy blood lipid profiles, lowering blood pressure, and improving insulin sensitivity which is an essential and first step in preventing Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [3].",944c9da8-5ac9-4ce5-b049-12e7f36cffca
7,discussion2," Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid (polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)) diets reduce fasting plasma triacylglycerol and very-low-density lipoprotein (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL))-cholesterol concentration on average 19% and 22%, respectively [11]. They also cause an increase in high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL))-cholesterol levels, which is highly beneficial as current research emphasizes higher high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels as preventive measures for long-term diseases [12]. The studies indicate a cardiovascular risk reduction and an all-case mortality reduction linked to the benefits of olive oil [13]. The long-standing conditions show a close relationship to Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence, for example, with over 50% of cases occurring in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [14].",19a690ca-1afb-495f-9f21-01459a0ea449
8,discussion3," The large intake of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)s as a substitute for trans fatty acids is believed to reduce the risk of T2DM in high-risk patients by up to 83% over a median of 4.4 years [14]. Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is limited to insulin resistance and includes a spectrum of liver conditions associated with intrahepatic fat accumulation and further complications. For example, a quarter of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which is also associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality [14]. In conclusion, a healthy lipid panel is essential in eliminating countless long-standing health concerns. Monounsaturated fatty acids, driven from olive oil, seem to play an outstanding role in preventive medicine.",7d0e9d6c-2c99-429e-ba03-4d1f8347b214
9,discussion4,"  Nuts and seeds and the role of polyunsaturated fatty acid  Asides from oil olive as the main source of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) in the Mediterranean diet, high quantities of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s in nuts, seeds, and fish also play a valuable role [15]. The most important polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) for Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is long-chain n-3 fatty acids, which include eicosapentaenoic, EPA, and docosahexaenoic, DHA [15]. These prevent liver adipogenesis by modifying transcription and suppressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 genes [16]. The main role of these genes is the regulation of hepatic fatty acid oxidation and synthesis, respectively [16]. Additionally, n-3 fatty acids suppress the direct uptake of fat into hepatocytes and modulate the expression of particular miRNAs [16,17].",1baccd5a-dc67-4512-851d-812b4640398b
10,discussion5," The well-established outcome of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by research is the prevention of hepatic steatosis, resulting in a beneficial role in disease management [18].  Effects of olive oil and a plant-based diet on inflammatory-related mechanisms  A bulk of the Mediterranean diet comprises plant-based foods, with a focus on plant-based protein sources. This includes legumes, moderate consumption of fish, and a limited amount of red meat [13]. Vegetables, fruits, and legumes are high in anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory, playing a fundamental role in preventing oxidative stress damage and cytokine release [13]. From these food sources, legumes have been identified as the most predictive component for lowering mortality [13]. Vegetables and fruits are equally important and consist of polyphenols, which are important bioactive compounds that increase fatty acid oxidation [7].",94f7fa6c-d8c1-41c4-a2c8-bed8cd48ad81
11,discussion6," Polyphenols promote fatty acid beta-oxidation and exert their anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting NF-κB directly or via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and chronic inflammatory pathways such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [15]. The recent literature has also shown a relationship between the ability of polyphenols to module the immune system by altering the role of WBCs and inflammatory cytokines that participate in the immunological defense [19]. Hence, the Mediterranean diet has been shown to positively influence inflammatory biomarkers, including adhesion molecules and cytokines, in presenting hepatic fat accumulation and ensuring limited blood levels of transaminase, triglycerides, cholesterol, and insulin resistance [20]. In conclusion, olive oil and plant-based diets, which are rich in polyphenols, have shown to have a positive impact on the human body’s defense mechanism.",3ec07626-ac0a-44d5-a2a7-93e09f5a3905
12,discussion7,"  Anti-cancer mechanism from olive oil polyphenols  Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with an increased risk of numerous cancers, with a well-established relationship between Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular cancer [21]. However, research has shown that Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with an increased risk for prostate and colon cancer [22]. When comparing the Mediterranean region with other populations, cancer incidence is drastically lower [22]. The role of olive oil and its associated polyphenols, especially oleuropein hydroxytyrosol, is an important component of the underlying anti-cancer mechanism [23]. Polyphenols increase apoptosis and cell cycle arrest while decreasing proliferation and angiogenesis [22]. The role of apoptosis is indicative of the increase in cell death domains, such as caspase-3,-7, p53, and Bax and Bak [22].",b414b3cf-0d05-47ee-b5c7-270ce4af4c86
13,discussion8," At the same time, suppression of neovascularization by olive oil polyphenols has resulted in a decrease in growth factors such as VEGF and TGFalpha-induced migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells [21]. These mechanisms drastically inhibited the underlying pathology and worked in preventing malignancy.  Limiting sodium  The Mediterranean diet aims to replace salt at the table with herbs and spices, ensuring favor yet adequate blood pressure control. The relationship between high sodium levels and blood pressure is well established, but the direct effect on Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is controversial. The current World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) guidelines indicate a sodium intake of <2000 mg/dl [24]. Many epidemiological studies have proven to show a positive correlation between sodium intake and body weight, independent of energy or sugar intake [24].",2b883045-c4c4-409b-90bb-8a49f862555d
14,discussion9," The literature has established a relationship between increase sodium intake and triglyceride levels, indicating a potential risk factor for Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [24]. The recommendation of a low-sodium diet has been beneficial in lowering overall mortality and morbidity, with hypertension being an underlying cause of many long-standing conditions [25].  Table 3 summarizes experimental and observational studies that were reviewed, and the study group analyzed along with the findings. These studies involved smaller populations but illustrated a positive correlation between Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the Mediterranean diet in numerous ways. This includes the reduction of intrahepatic fat accumulation and steatosis in relation to consuming the Mediterranean diet and an overall positive impact on Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) score.",fcae0e5e-dd3c-4b3c-83b2-74667cb76057

24,discussion19," Most of the studies in this review consist of relatively small sample sizes, which potentially limit the efficacy of the results published. Another limitation is the potential confounders that exist among the studies included in this systematic review. This allows for bias, as confounding factors within studies can alter the overall outcome. Lastly, studies use different methods for measuring Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) severity, but the definition of Mediterranean diet varied; hence the intervention amongst the studies may not have been consistent.  Conclusions  This systematic review outlines the significance of the Mediterranean diet in the management of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and identifies what has been currently studied, and essentially what needs to be focused on in the future to strengthen this relationship.",b81da465-5b16-4719-9499-7ed2cd5be579
25,discussion20," In this review, observational studies, cross-sectional, crossover, and literature reviews were analyzed, indicating a visible link between the two variables. The Mediterranean diet is a regime and a type of lifestyle that has been shown to positively enhancing well-being. It provides a significant number of advantages, being complex in monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)s, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s, and polyphenols, indicating its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer mechanisms. After reviewing the literature, the Mediterranean diet can be considered a major step forward in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) management. It promotes weight loss by replacing saturated fats and carbohydrates and plays a direct role in eliminating Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathology. Adapting the Mediterranean diet in the early stages may result in alterations in disease outcome, but more studies are required to confirm this correlation.",bb08def9-71bf-47a1-9526-5961003e350d
