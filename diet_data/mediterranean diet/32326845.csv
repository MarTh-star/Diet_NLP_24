Tannin content of infusions was determined using the tannins precipitation with the methyl-cellulose method [18]. An aliquot of 150 μL of infusions was mixed with 800 μL of deionized water, 250 μL of 0.04% (w/v) methyl-cellulose and 750 μL of saturated ammonium sulphate. For the blank, the sample aliquot was replaced by water and the methyl-cellulose and the ammonium sulphate were not included.

Assessment of Antioxidant Activity Using Lecithin Liposome System  Antioxidative activity of infusions in lecithin liposome model system was determined according to previous work with slight modifications [19]. At first, lecithin liposomes were prepared by suspending lecithin in deionized water at a concentration of 8 mg mL−1 by stirring, followed by sonification for 30 min in a sonication bath. An aliquot of diluted infusions (150 μL) was added to 200 μL of lecithin liposome system and the mixture was then sonicated for 2 min. To initiate the reaction, 100 μL of 0.15 mol L−1 cupric acetate was added and the mixture was shaken in the dark using an orbital shaker incubator.

6,methods6,"2 g of reaction mixture was dissolved in 5 mL of methanol and conjugated dienes were measured as the increase in absorbance at 234 nm. Results were expressed μmol rutin equivalents (RE) L−1 infusion.  2.6. Determination of Protein Glycation Inhibiting Activity  The anti-glycation activity of infusion was determined using an in vitro protocol [20]. In brief, 2 mL of phosphate buffer solution (1.5 mol L−1, pH 7.4) containing 50 mg mL−1 and 0.8 mol L−1 D-glucose were mixed with 500 μL and incubated at 37 °C for 7 days.

Then, 250 μL of starch solution (1% w/v) in 0.02  mol L−1 sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) was added and then further incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Afterwards, 500 μL of dinitrosalicylic acid was added into the mixture; the mixture was then incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. After cooling, 30 μL of reaction mixture was diluted with 270 μL deionized water and the absorbance was read at 540 nm [21]. Results were expressed μmol RE L−1 infusion.  Infusions (100 μL) were incubated at 37 °C with 50 μL α-glucosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1.0 U mL−1 in 0.1 mol L−1 phosphate buffer, pH 6.8). After 10 min, 25 μL of p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (p nitrophenyl α d glucopyranoside (PNG)) 5 mmol L−1 was added. The mixture was allowed for 5 min and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm against a blank solution where p nitrophenyl α d glucopyranoside (PNG) was replaced with 50 μL of buffer [22].",c8cb9327-04be-42f1-87fc-0cf4479f35db

Determination of Antibacterial Activity  The inhibitory effect of different concentrations (125–2000 μg·mL−1) of lyophilized infusion and pure compounds (gallic acid, catechin and quercetin) on the growth of L. monocytogenes EGD (serotype 1/2a), L. monocytogenes Scott A (serotype 4b), L. monocytogenes NCTC 4885 (serotype 4b), L. monocytogenes NCTC 4994 (serotype 4b), L. monocytogenes ATCC 23074 (serotype 4b), L. monocytogenes NCTC 1792 (serotype 4b), L. monocytogenes NCTC 7973 (serotype 1/2a), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovarm, Enteritidis NCTC 5188 and Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 was determined by the broth microdilution method [23]. An aliquot of overnight bacterial cultures (10 μL) was enriched with 90 μL of fresh broth and subsequently mixed with 100 μL of tested infusion or pure compounds.",64c4ae0e-583c-4f3b-a72d-a1a331c32c68
9,methods9," Microbial growth kinetic was recorded on a Multiskan™ GO Microplate Photometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vantaa, Finland). Optical density was read at 600 nm by taking measurements every 30 min for 18 h in controlled conditions of 37 °C. An agitation for 10 s was performed to achieve homogeneous suspensions before each measurement. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The minimum inhibitory concentration (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)) was defined as the lowest concentration of infusion or pure compound at which bacterial growth was inhibited compared to the control.  2.9. Sensory Evaluation of Infusions  The sensory evaluation of the herbal infusions was performed by 20 panelists (12 male; 8 female), aged between 18 and 24 years old. A previous study with some modification was used to evaluate the sensory properties of herbal infusions [24]. A volume of about 30 mL of each warm infusion (65 ± 5 °C), was served randomly to the panelists in a 50 mL transparent cup.",ef44b0ce-af7b-4ae3-aab4-97d67bfcf706
10,methods10," The members of the sensory panel were required to rinse their mouths thoroughly with warm water (~65 °C) after each evaluation and wait no less than 90 s before the next tasting, to minimize possible carry-over effects. In an attempt to appreciate the full sensory character of the infusion the panel members were asked to hold about 10 mL sample in the mouth for 5 s and swallow it gradually and where necessary, the tasting was repeated. The infusions were evaluated for a total of six attributes; color, aroma, flavor, aftertaste, astringency and overall acceptability. The results were recorded using a five-point hedonic scale extending from 1 (dislike very much) to 5 (live very much). All the samples were coded and none of the panel members received any other information regarding the infusions tested.  2.10.

Results and Discussion  3.1. Effects of Brewing Parameters on Bioactive Composition of Infusions  The present work investigates the potential of sun-dried grape pomace to be used as ingredient to produce herbal infusions with antioxidant and anti-hyperglycemic effects. Previous studies correlated these effects with the presence of different classes of polyphenols [25]. Thus, the optimization of brewing parameters aims to maximize the phenolic compounds in grape pomace infusion.",45982037-27a3-4737-a390-876f718a2450
12,methods12," More specific, the phenolic (the phenolic (TPC)), hydroxycinnamic (the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC)), flavonoids (the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC) flavonoids (TFC)) and tannin (the phenolic (the phenolic (TPC)) hydroxycinnamic (the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC)) flavonoids (the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC) flavonoids (TFC)) and tannin (TTC)) contents were determined (Table 2). the phenolic (TPC) values of the infusions ranged between 554 and 2901 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) L−1 infusion highlighting the great importance of brewing procedure. The highest the phenolic (TPC) value was found for the infusion prepared using 160 mL water per gram powder for 12 min at 85 °C. On the other hand, the use 40 mL water per gram powder for 9 min at 75 °C yielded the lowest the phenolic (TPC) value. Furthermore, results showed that all brewing parameters had a significant impact on the phenolic (TPC) (Table 3, p > 0.05).",317ce688-2ce1-4658-ad9a-56b38c3112ee
13,methods13," Quadratic effect of temperature and a negative interactive effect between water/solid ratio and temperature were also substantial for phenolic contents in infusion.  A great variety in the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC) of infusions was also found (Table 2); especially the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC) flavonoids (TFC) ranged from 35.0 to 116.4 mg caffeic acid equivalents (CAE) L−1 infusion. Similarly to the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC) flavonoids (TFC), the highest the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC) was achieved using 160 mL water per gram powder for 12 min at 85 °C. According to the central composite design (CCD), only temperature had a linear effect on the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC), whereas quadratic effects of time and water/solid ratio was found (Table 3, p > 0.05).",29aa547e-9ca7-4f62-8001-66e0fb937ef5
14,methods14," The proposed model was found as significant and non-significant lack of fit demonstrating the suitability of model to describe the effects of brewing parameters on the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC).  Results also showed that grape pomace infusions comprised important amounts of flavonoids that were strongly affected by brewing parameters. More specific, all parameters studied had a significant effect on the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC) flavonoids (TFC) resulting a range between 42.9 and 84.2 mg CE L−1 infusion. The richest infusion in flavonoids was prepared by the infusion of 160 mL water per gram powder for 12 min at 85 °C (Table 2). central composite design (CCD) reveals the quadratic effect of water/solid ratio and interactive effects for water/solid ratio with extraction time and temperatures. The polynomial model was found as significant and non-significant lack of fit.",23d76fb9-02aa-471e-bd2e-75957d8cefec
15,methods15,"  Finally, the phenolic (the phenolic (TPC)) hydroxycinnamic (the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC)) flavonoids (the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC) flavonoids (TFC)) and tannin (TTC) of infusions were determined as grape tannins are correlated with bioactivity and astringency [26]. Results showed a linear and quadratic effects of temperature and water/solid ratio on tannin contents in infusions (Table 3). The fluctuation of the phenolic (the phenolic (TPC)) hydroxycinnamic (the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC)) flavonoids (the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC) flavonoids (TFC)) and tannin (TTC)s in infusions was from 0 to 24.09 mg tannins L−1 infusion. The maximum tannin content in infusion was used for the optimization of brewing parameters due to their bioactivity, although their astringency could decrease the acceptance of infusion by consumers.  3.2.",d7873c45-6fd6-4a2b-8270-69a2c2d15191
16,methods16," Effects of Brewing Parameters on Bioactivity of Infusions  The brewing parameters of sun-dried grape pomace infusion were optimized in order to boost its bioactivity. In particular, the impact of brewing time, temperature and water/solid ratio on physiological functions related to the antioxidant and antidiabetic effects was studied. Except for Diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, results of other biological assays were expressed as rutin equivalents since its antioxidant and antidiabetic potency is well-established [27]. Firstly, the Diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activity of infusions was determined revealing a wide range of value; namely, it ranged between 1078 and 4672 μmol Trolox L−1 infusion. The brewing of 200 mL of water per gram of material for 9 min at 75 °C produced infusion with the highest Diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activity, followed by the infusion that was prepared by the use of 160 mL water per gram powder for 12 min at 85 °C.",8f047892-26d8-45f7-9794-ad8d4e79ee1f
17,methods17," The latter infusion had the highest phenolic content among infusions studied. The linear effects of three processing variables were significant (p > 0.05) on Diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) values of the infusions as it was observed for the phenolic (TPC) and the phenolic (TPC) hydroxycinnamic (THC) flavonoids (TFC). Table 3 shows also that the model and lack of fit were significant (p > 0.05).  The antioxidant effect of infusions was also assessed using a lecithin liposome model. Similarly to Diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, the most active sample was prepared by brewing of 200 mL of water per gram of material for 9 min at 75 °C. Surprisingly, data of this method showed a tendency slightly differing from that observed for Diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) values. This may be explained by different mechanisms of action of antioxidants. All measurements of the antioxidant effect of infusions on lecithin liposome model are displayed in Table 2.",1e1f6e7f-e0f5-4e31-83e6-d198b5d04a77
18,methods18," As it is seen, the antioxidant activity was in the range of 22.0–95.5 μmol RE L−1 infusion. According to Table 3, the antioxidant activity is strongly affected by all brewing parameters (p > 0.05). Furthermore, quadratic effect of water/solid ratio and interactive effects were also contributed to the polynomial model, which provides an acceptable prediction of three variables on antioxidant potency.  The anti-glycoxidative properties of raisin grape pomace infusions were assessed using a bovine serum albumin—glucose model. All brewing parameters had a significant effect on anti-glycoxidative activity of infusion (p > 0.05); this activity ranged between 0.262 and 2.336 μmol RE L−1 infusion (Table 2 and Table 3). The most active infusion was prepared by mixing 160 mL water per gram powder for 12 min at 85 °C, whereas the brewing of the same water to plant material ratio for 6 min at 65 °C yielded the infusion with the lowest BSA activity.",b6a47a4f-9d83-4ec6-818b-4d2a02c1c7e8
19,methods19," Apart from brewing parameters, a quadratic effect of temperature and interactive effect of water/solid ratio and temperature were also found contributing to the polynomial model that was found as significant and non-significant lack of fit.  Finally, the inhibition effects of infusions on the α-glucosidase and the α-amylase activities were determined. Both assays are considered as a good indicator of antidiabetic activity and are used to screen phytoconstituents for potential drugs to treat diabetes mellitus [28]. A great diversity in inhibitory activities toward α-glucosidase and the α -amylase enzymes was observed (Table 2). More specifically, the inhibitory activity was 571 to 1720 μmol RE L−1 infusion and 80–389 μmol RE L−1 infusion for α-glucosidase and the α-amylase, respectively. The above diversity can be attributed to the fact that the inhibitory values were strongly affected by brewing time, temperature and water/solid ratio.",1545dc78-b821-4578-8f62-0e47a93603a7
20,methods20," According to Table 3, α-glucosidase inhibitory activity is also influenced by quadratic effects of water/solid ratio and temperature; while the corresponding activity of α-amylase was affected by quadratic effect of water/solid ratio and interactive effect between water/solid ratio and temperature. The brewing conditions for the preparation of the most adiabetic infusion were similar for both inhibitory effects.  3.3. Optimization of Parameters  The optimal conditions for the preparation of grape pomace infusion were determined after applying the desirability function for all of the investigated responses in terms of phenolic composition and bioactivity. The purpose of the optimization was to recover the maximum value of each response. Results showed that the brewing of 200 mL of water per gram of pomace powder for 9.8 min at 95 °C is the most appropriate method to prepare grape pomace infusion.",32c213db-0e82-4e7e-b12d-49f303849908
21,methods21," Taking into consideration that the main objective of the study was to formulate a functional infusion, the optimal conditions were re-determined using the desirability function for responses related only to the bioactivity. In this case, the ratio water to solid and infusion temperature were same, but the optimum infusion time was 12.2 min. Afterwards, optimum conditions for preparation infusion with highest antioxidant or anti-hyperglycemic effects were also investigated, but there are no differences. Table 4 also demonstrates that the experimental values for optimized grape pomace infusion were close to predicted ones. This confirms that the proposed model was successfully applied for the brewing of grape pomace powder to obtain infusion with highest functionality.  3.4. Antimicrobial Effects of Infusion  The most active infusion was also tested for its antimicrobial effects against foodborne pathogenic bacteria.",ef9af584-da70-4548-840a-4e88eb0b61dc
22,methods22," Previous studies present a significant bacterial growth inhibition by grape pomace extracts [29,30]. Therefore, the grape skin infusion was freeze-dried and its inhibitory effects against an array of Listeria serotypes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and E. coli was assessed. Results showed that minimum inhibitory concentration for the infusion against Listeria serotypes ranged between 0.25 and 2 mg mL−1 pointing out a variation in the susceptibility of different L. monocytogenes serotypes to infusion treatments. The anti-Listeria potential of the infusion is significantly higher than the potential of acetonic grape pomace extracts from four Virginia-grown grape varieties [30]. Although there is considerable fluctuation in the response of different Listeria strains to plant extracts, the increase of phenolic content in raisin grape pomace due to dehydration is possibly accountable for the improved growth inhibition of the present infusion compared to grape pomace extracts.",3e7ae20d-7e2e-4fb9-a3e7-4e21b83ca5c6
23,methods23," The infusion also had an inhibitory effect on S. enterica, S. aureus, and E. coli bacteria (Table 5). In an attempt to rationalize the antimicrobial potency of infusion, the inhibitory effects of gallic acid, catechin and quercetin were determined. These compounds and their derivatives are substantial constituents of hydroxybenzoic acids, flavonols and flavan-3-ols in “Xinisteri” dehydrated grapes [15]. minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values indicate that quercetin present the most potent antimicrobial activity among compounds studied (Table 5). Results also demonstrated that more phytochemicals contribute to the antimicrobial potency of infusion and synergistic interaction may occurs. Overall, the present work highlights the potential of the tested infusion to prevent the growth of some Listeria serotypes (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 0.25–0.5 mg mL−1); at concentrations which are almost equal with a cup of infusion.  3.5.",a54e9611-9bab-4cc1-a22d-fbb64de1c0e0
24,methods24," Sensory Analysis  The flavor and taste of grape pomace infusion was neutral and flat. These characteristics allow its consumption, but the consumers may not enjoy it. Thus, the improvement of organoleptic attributes of infusion were attempted using Mediterranean aromatic plants. More specifically, lemon balm and lemon verbena were added to grape pomace powder at a concentration of 15% w/w and 30% w/w due to its special flavor and taste as well as they are widely consumed as herbal infusions. Furthermore, both plant materials displayed antioxidant, antimicrobial and antidiabetic activity, thus, their addition was not expected to deplete significantly the functionality of infusion [31,32,33]. Figure 1 summarizes the scores for sensory evaluation attributes of five grape pomace infusions. It reveals a substantial impact of herbs on the infusion’s color. The addition of lemon balm into grape pomace powder contributed to the most attractive color among the tested infusions.",e8f97188-377b-45c0-b907-6dde51085167
25,methods25," Specifically, the slight yellow to straw color of pure grape pomace infusion was altered to a brown color. On the other hand, the enrichment of grape pomace infusion with lemon verbena yielded a dark green colored infusion. Regarding the aroma, all mixtures of herbs with grape pomace had a better acceptance than pure grape pomace infusions. About of 50% of participants found a sweet taste for all infusions, because of the use of sun-dried grape pomace and only 27% of participants stated the presence of grape’s aroma in pure grape pomace infusion (data not shown). Infusions with lemon balm smells like herbs; whereas the participants found aroma of herbs and fruits in infusions with lemon verbena. Similar findings were reported for taste of infusions; albeit the panelists preferred the taste of grape pomace-lemon verbana infusions. The addition of both herbs did not change statistically the astringency and aftertaste.",189ef934-73bc-4f91-aa0a-4b3ad62a1bd0
26,methods26," Furthermore, the scores of overall acceptance of infusions shows that the mixtures of 30% lemon balm to grape pomace and 15% lemon verbena to grape pomace were preferred, for the preparation of infusions. Finally, all participants declared that the pure grape pomace infusion was pleasant but the supplementation with common herbs improved its organoleptic attributes. The latter is maybe correlated to the fact that the panelists are familiar with the consumption of these herbal infusions.  4. Conclusions  The present work highlights the potential of sun-dried grape pomace to be utilized as an ingredient for functional foods as herbal infusions. The market of these products is rapidly increasing and the food industry is constantly seeking ways to introduce new products and/or to reformulate traditional products.",3c408015-2f32-4949-ab6a-f87bf27f40ab
27,methods27," Therefore, the exploitation of sun-dried grape pomace to produce functional infusions is an alternative strategy to promote sustainability of wine-making and to create a novel product. This study describes the optimum brewing parameters to produce infusion with antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-hyperglycemic effects and provides a guideline for its formulation. Finally, the neutral taste and aroma alongside the application of water as extractor, permit the use of the infusion or grape pomace infusion powder as an additive in many foods or edible coatings.
