0,background0,"Nutrition research has traditionally concentrated on the detailed examination of possible health roles and consequences of dietary components (foods, nutrients, or both) in isolation. However, the effects of individual foods and nutrients on health are usually difficult to estimate, given that they can be small [1]. Additionally, foods and thus nutrients are consumed in combination and their combined effects may be interactive or synergistic [2]. Further, because when eating, people mainly choose to combine foods in meals or snacks as per specific compositions [3, 4], there should be some patterns or characteristics in meals and snacks. Thus, understanding how nutritional quality of meals and snacks is associated with overall diet quality and health status (such as measures of body fatness) is important for the development of science-based recommendations of meals and snacks for consumers [5].",7deb3b22-7aa2-47e5-9e01-43aa38268b3d
1,background1," While Dietary Reference Intakes and other dietary recommendations are given on a per day basis, nutritional advice considering meals and snacks separately might also be easier and more practical for people to understand and follow dietary guidelines [5, 6].  Nevertheless, only a limited number of studies have been conducted to date to examine meal and snack eating behaviors in relation to overall diet and health markers [7–11], at least partly because there is no definitive consensus about what constitutes a snack, a meal, or an eating occasion [5]. While some researchers have relied on respondents’ self-identification of meals, snacks, or eating occasions [7–9, 12–18], others have attempted to use more objective criteria (based on clock time, energy content/contribution, or both) [8–10, 19–30]. An accurate distinction between meals and snacks is important, because they are hypothesized to have different effects on energy and nutrient intakes [10, 31, 32].",263be5b2-aec6-42d4-91a4-a4518c18e43a
2,background2," An understanding of the influence of different meal and snack definitions on the associations between nutritional quality of meals and snacks with overall diet quality and measures of body fatness may help establish consensus on the most appropriate research definition for meals and snacks [5]. Additionally, the associations of meal and snack intakes or patterns with measures of body fatness (as well as dietary intake) may be confounded by possible under-reporting of eating frequency (that is, meal and/or snack intake) concomitant with the under-reporting of energy intake (EI) particularly by obese or overweight subjects [33, 34].  Another important issue is a lack of established tools for assessing nutritional quality of meals and snacks [6]. In this context, the British Food Standards Agency (Food Standards Agency (FSA)) nutrient profiling system [35–37] may be a suitable or attractive choice.",173f8a63-6f3c-47b8-af18-6be9ce486175
3,background3," The Food Standards Agency (FSA) score of overall diet has been shown to be prospectively associated with certain health outcomes such as metabolic syndrome [37] and weight change [38]. One advantage of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) score is the fact that it is calculated based on the contents of individual components (i.e., energy, saturated fatty acid (saturated fatty acid (SFA)), total sugar, sodium, fruits/vegetables/nuts, dietary fiber, and protein) per 100 g of foods and beverages consumed and also is weighted for EI. Thus, it can provide a proportional measure of meal and snack quality in relation to EI.  The aim of this cross-sectional study in British adults was to examine how nutritional quality of meals and snacks assessed by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) nutrient profiling system is associated with overall diet quality, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), and waist circumference (WC), by the use of different definitions of meals and snacks.

4,methods0,"Survey design This cross-sectional study was based on the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS)): Adults Aged 19 to 64 Years. Details of the rationale, design, and methods of the survey have been described in detail elsewhere [39]. Briefly, the sample was selected using a multi-stage random probability design with postal sectors within mainland Great Britain as first stage units. Eligibility was defined as being aged 19–64 y and not pregnant or breast-feeding. One eligible adult per private household was selected at random. Data collection was conducted from July 2000 to June 2001.  Anthropometric measurements All anthropometric measurements were performed in duplicate by trained fieldworkers, and the mean value of two measurements was used in the analysis. Height (to the nearest 0.1 cm) and weight (to the nearest 0.1 kg) were measured while the subject was barefoot and wearing light clothes only.",b5e89d6d-2adf-4939-871d-8430f624da58
5,methods1," body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. WC was measured at the midpoint between the iliac crest and the lower rib (to the nearest 0.1 cm).  Dietary assessment Dietary data were collected by a 7-d weighed dietary record. A detailed description of the procedure has been published elsewhere [39, 40]. Briefly, each subject was supplied with a set of accurately calibrated Soenhle Quanta digital food scales and recording diaries. The subject was given written and verbal instructions by trained interviewers on how to weigh and record items in the diary. When weighing was not possible (e.g., eating out; 47% of total food items recorded), the subject was asked to record as much information as possible. Trained interviewers visited the household at least twice during the recording period and checked the completeness of food recording.",20c48005-05c0-42f4-8cd6-8fcaeb154c85
6,methods2," All the collected diaries were checked by trained nutritionists in terms of coding, recorded weights, and descriptions of items consumed. Estimates of daily intake for foods, energy, and selected nutrients were calculated based on the Food Standards Agency nutrient databank [41], which is in turn based on McCance and Widdowson’s Composition of Foods series [42] and manufacturers’ data where applicable. For all dietary variables, mean values over 7 d were used in the analysis. Values of food and nutrient intake were energy-adjusted using the density method (i.e., % of energy for energy-providing nutrients and amount per 10 MJ of energy for foods and other nutrients).  Assessment of overall diet quality As measures of overall diet quality, the healthy diet indicator (healthy diet indicator (HDI)) and the Mediterranean diet score (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)) were calculated, as described elsewhere [10].",5ee3d2a3-dc44-4805-bd87-823a4f6536d8
7,methods3," Both diet quality measures have been shown to be prospectively associated with certain health outcomes such as increased survival and decreased disease burden [43–45]. The healthy diet indicator (HDI) was selected as a diet quality measure mainly based on nutrient intake while the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) mainly based on food intake. The healthy diet indicator (HDI) includes six nutrients and one food group (saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, cholesterol, protein, dietary fiber, fruits and vegetables, and non-milk extrinsic sugar) [43, 44]. When intake was within the recommended range according to WHO guidelines, a score of one was assigned to that component; otherwise, a score of zero was assigned, with a total score ranging from zero to seven. Hence, a higher score reflected a healthier dietary pattern.",548c31cf-532f-4cbe-b822-7a2bc4097827
8,methods4," The Mediterranean diet score (MDS) represents a Mediterranean-type diet and is based on the consumption of nine different components (vegetables; legumes; fruits, nuts, and seeds; cereals; fish; the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fats; meat; dairy products; and alcohol) [44, 45]. A score of one was assigned to moderate alcohol intake or, depending on the component, intake above or below the sex-specific median. Scores for all nine components were summed and resulted in a total range from zero to nine, whereby a higher score reflected better adherence to a Mediterranean-type diet.  Calculation of Food Standards Agency nutrient profiling system diet score A detailed description of the procedure for calculating Food Standards Agency (FSA) nutrient profiling system diet score has been published elsewhere [35–37]. Briefly, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) score was computed for each food and beverage on the basis of the nutrient content per 100 g.",e46ac546-f531-4f70-a875-abb5e7eb128f
9,methods5," Positive points (0 to +10) are allocated for the content of energy (kJ), saturated fatty acid (SFA) (g), total sugar (g), and sodium (mg), while negative points (0 to −5) are allocated for the content of fruits/vegetables/nuts (g), dietary fiber (g), and protein (g). Scores for foods and beverages are thus based on a discrete continuous scale theoretically ranging from −15 (most healthy) to +40 (least healthy).  Aggregated scores at the individual level (Food Standards Agency (FSA) diet scores) were computed with the use of arithmetic EI-weighted means; for each food or beverage consumed, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) score of the food or beverage was multiplied by the EI provided by that food or beverage, and then these terms were summed for all foods and beverages consumed and divided by the sum of the EI provided by all foods and beverages for each individual. Thus, Food Standards Agency (FSA) scores of total diet, meals, and snacks were calculated as follows.",31b1d527-18aa-47aa-98ca-6cb3b7d04d09
10,methods6," Food Standards Agency (FSA)score of total diet=ΣFood Standards Agency (FSA)score of food×EIfrom food/totalEI   Food Standards Agency (FSA)score of meals=ΣFood Standards Agency (FSA)score of food consumedasmeals×EIfrom food consumedasmeals/EIfrom meals   Food Standards Agency (FSA)score of snacks=ΣFood Standards Agency (FSA)score of food consumedassnacks×EIfrom food consumedassnacks/EIfrom snacks    Alcoholic beverages were excluded from the computation, because they were excluded from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) scoring system. Increasing Food Standards Agency (FSA) diet score therefore reflected decreasing quality in the foods consumed.  Definition of meals and snacks In the present study, eating occasions were defined as any occasion when any food or drink was consumed (without considering energy content) [10, 13, 14, 20, 30].",8eedf806-b096-4f2b-ad38-69ded7ba7c51
11,methods7," If two eating occasions occurred in ≤15 min, the two events were counted as a single eating occasion; when >15 min separated two eating occasions, these were considered distinct eating occasions [10, 20, 21, 23, 30]. All eating occasions were further divided into either meals or snacks with the use of two different published definitions: on the basis of (1) clock time [24] and (2) contribution to total EI [25]. For the first definition, meals were defined as eating events reported during selected times of the day, that is, 0600–1000, 1200–1500, and 1800–2100 h [10]. All other eating occasions were considered snacks. For the second definition, a meal was defined as any eating episode comprising ≥15% of total EI, regardless of the time of day or composition of foods or beverages consumed [10, 46]. All other eating episodes were classified as a snack. For each participant, dietary intakes from meals and snacks were calculated.",1d8e688b-ce6f-46ad-909c-7034f3939e7e
12,methods8," Also, eating frequency and meal and snack frequency were calculated based on all eating occasions except for those providing <210 kJ of energy [9, 10, 13, 14, 20, 30, 46]. It should be noted that no self-definition of eating occasions was included in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) dietary record.  Assessment of non-dietary variables The socio-economic status of each respondent (i.e., occupational social class) was self-reported and categorized as manual or non-manual. Smoking status (never, former, or current) was also self-reported. A 7-d physical activity diary was carried out concurrently with the dietary record. A detailed description of the procedure has been published elsewhere [39, 40]. Briefly, the subject was shown by trained interviewers how to record the information, and was asked to record, to the nearest 10 min, how long they spent doing various activities on that day.",aa9fac50-35a0-48b8-a5b6-fd225c5f5d93
13,methods9," Trained interviewers checked the completeness of records at least twice during the recording period. Subsequently, time spent daily in sleep, light, moderate, and vigorous-intensity activities was computed for each day of recording. The number of hours spent per day on each activity was multiplied by the metabolic equivalent (metabolic equivalent (MET)) value of that activity (derived from a published table) [47], and all metabolic equivalent (MET)-h products were summed to produce a total metabolic equivalent (MET)-h score for the day. A mean daily value over 7-d was used in the analysis. Overall dietary reporting status was evaluated based on the ratio of reported EI to estimated energy requirement (estimated energy requirement (EER)) [40]. We calculated each subject’s estimated energy requirement (EER) based on the information on age, weight, height, and physical activity, with the use of equations published in the US Dietary Reference Intakes [48].",ccb45ac4-9524-4a3b-9c38-9781703c30dc
14,methods10," Physical activity category was determined for each subject based on the physical activity level calculated as total metabolic equivalent (MET)-h/d (from the 7-d physical activity diary) divided by 24.  Analytic sample Of 3704 potentially eligible people identified for the study, 2251 (61%) participated in the survey. For the present analysis, we excluded a total of 736 subjects with missing information on the variables used (n 468 for anthropometric data; n 527 for dietary data; n 56 for social class; n 3 for smoking status; and n 593 for physical activity; some subjects had more than one missing value). We further excluded 28 underweight subjects (body mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/m2) [49] and 36 subjects without any snacking occasion (based on either definition) during the 7-d period. The final analysis sample comprised 1451 adults aged 19–64 years (659 men and 792 women; 39% of eligible sample).",7b6bca7f-af71-4feb-b7a2-e16f8c549781
15,methods11," Further exclusion of subjects who reported dieting or that illness had affected their eating during the diet recording period (n 386) did not alter the findings of the present study (data not shown). Although both dieting and illness are likely to have some influence on the quantity of diet, it is unknown whether or how these factors are associated with the quality of diet (i.e., energy-adjusted dietary intakes as well as overall diet quality). To minimize the possibility of bias caused by excluding these subjects, they were included in the analysis. ",d2c761e1-aee2-4eb3-b0c8-27664d67c614

32,discussion1," These figures are within the range of those observed in other countries, including Norway (17% for men and 21% for women) [15], Brazil (21% for both sex combined) [24], the US (23% for both men and women) [16], and Finland (36% for men and 40% for women) [17]. This suggests that a considerable proportion of total EI is derived from snacks in affluent countries, whatever definitions are applied.  Only a very limited number of studies have compared the dietary composition of meals and snacks. Although the definitions of meals and snacks varied across studies, a consistent finding is that meals provide a higher proportion of EI from fat or protein than did snacks [18, 26–29]. Meals had a lower proportion of total sugars but not total carbohydrate [26] or had a higher density of dietary fiber than did snacks [27, 29]. These observations are generally similar to those obtained in the present study.",4318acf1-9c9c-46ad-ac7c-1055f617e90a
33,discussion2," Taken together, it is speculated that meals and snacks are differentially associated with overall diet quality and health status. In the present study, lower nutritional quality of meals (assessed by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) score) was associated with lower overall diet quality (assessed by healthy diet indicator (HDI) and Mediterranean diet score (MDS)), independent of the definition of meals. Lower nutritional quality of snacks was similarly associated with lower overall diet quality, but the associations were generally weaker mainly due to their smaller contribution to total EI than meals. However, given some evidence that nutritional quality of snack is better in the morning compared to later in the day [50], future research considering each snack occasion separately according to the time of day would be of interest. In any case, because some of the components for calculating the Food Standards Agency (FSA) diet score (e.g.",2d17d701-ded0-4860-9eed-b4373d79e8dc
34,discussion3,", fruits, vegetables, nuts, saturated fatty acid (SFA), protein, and dietary fiber) are also those for healthy diet indicator (HDI) and Mediterranean diet score (MDS), the present results should be interpreted with this kind of circularity between Food Standards Agency (FSA) score and healthy diet indicator (HDI) and Mediterranean diet score (MDS) in mind. Nevertheless, this circularity should not explain the difference of the strengths of the associations.  For measures of body fatness, we did not observe clear or consistent associations with diet quality of meals and snacks, which may not be unexpected given that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) score does not necessarily focus on obesity prevention. The present study showed a number of sex differences in the associations of nutritional quality of meals and snacks with dietary intake and measures of body fatness, which might be due to sex differences in dietary habits (e.g.",a6404adf-c665-4327-8de0-076c9943fb93
35,discussion4,", higher snack frequency, higher proportion of EI from snacks, and lower intakes of fruits/vegetables/nuts and dairy products in men). In any case, as a few existing studies on meal and snack eating behaviors in relation to overall diet and measures of body fatness have been producing somewhat conflicting findings [7–11], more research, preferably with a prospective design, should be conducted before reaching a firm conclusion.  The present study showed modest but significant associations of nutritional quality of meals and snacks assessed by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) score with overall diet quality. Theoretically, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) score could be used in any population with any dietary habit because the score is calculated based on dietary components per weight of foods and beverages. This is not the case for many established measures for assessing overall diet quality, because they are usually developed based on dietary guidelines targeted for specific populations.",82eacca7-9d94-4882-940f-2bcd22929c04
36,discussion5," Additionally, because the Food Standards Agency (FSA) score is weighted for EI, the score can be directly compared between meals and snacks within populations in addition to among populations, which is not the case for, for example, Mediterranean diet score (MDS) where scoring is dependent on the distribution of dietary intake within populations. Taken together, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) score might be a useful tool for assessing nutritional quality of meals and snacks in future research.  In the present study, the direction of the association of nutritional quality of meals and snacks with body mass index (BMI) and WC somewhat changed after adjustment for EI:estimated energy requirement (EER).",4e594fb9-2513-45aa-a0d5-561fee32d25f
37,discussion6," Given that under-reporters were characterized by higher body mass index (BMI) and WC and higher nutritional quality of meals and snacks (data not shown), this may be due to the under-reporting of energy-dense or less healthy foods (and hence over-estimation of diet quality) concomitant with the under-reporting of EI by subjects with higher body mass index (BMI) and WC [30]. Thus, the present study may highlight the key importance of adjusting for EI misreporting in studies of dietary variables associated with EI misreporting (the Food Standards Agency (FSA) diet score in this case) in relation to measures of body fatness.  The strengths of this study include the use of objective and published definitions of meals and snacks based on detailed dietary information obtained from a 7-d weighed dietary record, measured anthropometric data, and the use of individualized measure of estimated energy requirement (EER) for assessing EI misreporting. However, there are also several limitations.",10675cdb-0277-4398-8d72-8297f4940c8d
38,discussion7," First, the cross-sectional nature of the study does not permit the assessment of causality owing to the uncertain temporality of the association. Only a prospective study would provide better understanding of the relation between meal and snack intake and overall diet quality and measures of body fatness.  Another limitation of the present study is the relatively low response rate (61%), and only 39% of the eligible sample was included in the present study. The subjects included in the present analysis (n 1451) differed somewhat from those excluded from the analysis (n 705–758 depending on variables). The excluded subjects were more likely to be younger, be in manual occupations, and be current smokers (all P < 0.05). However, a previous analysis concluded that there was no evidence to suggest serious non-response bias in National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) [39].",893ac975-169a-4ed5-889b-1eb7161e6ccd
39,discussion8," Additionally, although pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the sample of National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS), postpartum and non-lactating women were included in the present analysis (because of a lack of information), which might cause bias with regard to WC and body mass index (BMI). Further, although we adjusted for a variety of potential confounding variables, residual confounding could not be ruled out.  Finally, because there is no definitive consensus about what constitutes a snack or a meal, the present results should be interpreted cautiously and oversimplification should be avoided. As mentioned above, we could not conduct the present analysis based on self-identification of eating occasions, the most common definition of meals and snacks (because of a lack of information in National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS)), although it is subject to inconsistencies due to differences in individual perception [32].",2a154db4-606f-468f-8ece-22da0d99a9de
40,discussion9," Additionally, meals and snacks based on time may be problematic, because eating patterns vary according to lifestyle (e.g., shift workers, individuals who consistently eat their meals at non-traditional times of day) as well as the cultural environment [32]. Furthermore, meals and snacks based on EI contribution (≥15% or <15%) was made on the basis of the US national averages of the distribution of energy from (self-defined) meals compared with (self-defined) snacks (breakfast: ≈ 16%; lunch: ≈ 25%; dinner: ≈ 37%; and snack: ≈ 22% from two occasions) [16]. This may not be suitable in the present British population, although the EI-contribution-based definition has recently been proposed for surveys where no information on self-identification of eating occasions is available [46]. Thus, results may possibly differ on the basis of other definitions.",8b01d28c-d6f1-4b0d-adbe-375582c412ab
41,discussion10," In any case, as research explicitly examining the impact of these different definitions is limited, further research using different definitions of meals and snacks is warranted.  Conclusions In this cross-sectional study in British adults, lower nutritional quality of meals (assessed by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) score) was associated with lower overall diet quality (assessed by healthy diet indicator (HDI) and Mediterranean diet score (MDS)). Lower nutritional quality of snacks was similarly associated with lower overall diet quality, but the associations were generally weaker mainly due to their lower contribution to total EI. These associations were not dependent on the definition of meals and snacks. The associations between nutritional quality of meals and snacks and body mass index (BMI) and WC were not clear or consistent.",24d446a2-0cb1-4e9b-b6f6-4ef03f5f02fa
42,discussion11," The present findings suggest stronger associations of nutritional quality of meals with overall diet quality (but not necessarily measures of body fatness) than that of snacks.
