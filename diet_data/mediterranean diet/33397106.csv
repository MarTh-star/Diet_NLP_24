0,methods0," A prospective cohort analysis was conducted within the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus trial, involving 6,647 men and women aged 55–75 years with overweight or obesity and metabolic syndrome. Using a validated, semiquantitative 143-item food frequency questionnaire completed at baseline, the dietary pattern adherence scores were calculated. An extensive neuropsychological test battery was administered at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were used to assess associations between 2-year changes in cognitive function z-scores across tertiles of baseline adherence to the a priori dietary patterns.   Study Design  The present analyses were conducted within the framework of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED))-Plus trial, as an observational cohort, assessing the longitudinal (2-year) associations between baseline adherence to prespecified dietary patterns and cognitive performance.",9dff4dc9-3640-450f-8652-71e480d8f7bb
1,methods1," The PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus study is an ongoing 6-year, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group and primary prevention trial conducted in Spain. The aim of the trial is to assess the effect of an intensive weight loss intervention program based on an energy-restricted traditional MedDiet and physical activity promotion and behavioral support, on clinical cardiovascular events, than usual care and dietary counseling intervention only with an energy unrestricted MedDiet (control group). More detailed information about the study protocol can be found at http://predimedplus.com/ and elsewhere (Martínez-González et al., 2019).  Participants  Participants were recruited between October 2013 and December 2016 in 23 Spanish health centers.",e85ca8eb-9ba3-4d40-ac06-bd6366093d76
2,methods2," Eligible participants were community-dwelling adults (55–75 years) with overweight or obesity (Body mass index (BMI): 27–40 kg/m2) who met at least three criteria for metabolic syndrome, namely, without stroke, myocardial infarction, or diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease at baseline, according to the International Diabetes Federation and the American Heart Association . Participants who had not completed the baseline dietary questionnaires or had reported energy intakes outside the prespecified limits of ≥800 to ≤4,000 kcal/day for men and ≥500 to ≤3,500 kcal/day for women were excluded from these analyses (Willett, 2012). If a given cognitive function assessment was missing, this test was not included in the analysis for that participant.",1ddf9788-4421-402b-a15b-78cf872c470f
3,methods3,"  Exposure: Dietary Assessments  Trained dietitians assessed dietary intake via face-to-face interviews at baseline using a previously validated semiquantitative 143-item food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) (Fernández-Ballart et al., 2010). For each item, a portion size was established, and nine consumption frequencies were available, ranging from “never or almost never” to “≥6 times/day”. Energy and nutrient intakes were obtained using data from Spanish food composition tables and by multiplying the frequency by the portion size and accounting for the duration of the period assessed .  Dietary pattern adherence scores were computed from responses to the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). In the case of the MedDiet, it was determined based on a Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) score, ranging from 0 to 14 points, which has been previously validated (Schröder et al.",d5db33e2-25fd-414f-b40f-d67c86760ce5
4,methods4,", 2011; García-Conesa et al., 2020). The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was defined using the score developed by Fung et al. (2008), which ranges from 8 to 40 points. For the MedDiet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, the score developed by Morris et al. (2015a; Berendsen et al., 2018), which ranges from 0 to 15 points, was used.  Outcome: Cognitive Assessments  Participants completed a battery of cognitive tasks at baseline and 2 years of follow-up. This battery of neuropsychological tests included Mini-Mental State Examination (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)), a commonly used cognitive screening test ; clock-drawing test (clock drawing test (CDT)) for evaluating visuospatial and visuo-constructive capacity (del Ser Quijano et al., 2004; Aprahamian et al.",32c65394-8ce8-4727-82c6-d976d5d5b25c
5,methods5,", 2009; Paganini-Hill and Clark, 2011); semantical and phonological verbal fluency tasks (VFT-a and VFT-p, respectively) for assessing verbal ability and executive function ; Trail Making Tests (Trail Making Tests (TMT)) parts A and B for executive function assessment, where part A assesses attention and processing speed and part B further examines cognitive flexibility (Llinàs-Reglà et al., 2017); and forward recall and backward recall Digit Span Tests (DST-f and DST-b, respectively) of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), where DST-f evaluates attention and short-term memory capacity and DST-b tests working memory (Wechsler, 1997; Rossi et al., 2008). Raw scores for each cognitive assessment were standardized using the mean and standard deviation from the baseline population scores, creating z-scores. Global cognitive function (Global cognitive function (GCF)) was determined as a composite score of all eight assessments (Shah et al.",42f810e3-d8a2-424b-9421-52d093896f1c
6,methods6,", 2013; Gómez Martínez et al., 2021), adding or subtracting each individual test value based on whether a higher score indicates higher or lower cognitive performance, respectively, using z-scores according to the following equation:  Global cognitive function (GCF)=(zMini Mental State Examination (MMSE)+zclock drawing test (CDT)+zVFTa+zVFTb+(-zTrail Making Tests (TMT)A)+(-zTrail Making Tests (TMT)B)+zDSTf+zDSTb)/8.  Covariate Assessment  Trained staff collected information about sociodemographic (i.e., age, sex, education level, and civil status) and lifestyle (i.e., physical activity, dietary intake, and smoking habits) factors via interviewer-administered questionnaires. Physical activity was assessed using a Spanish validated version of the Minnesota leisure-time physical activity questionnaire (Elosua et al., 1994, 2000). Total daily energy intake was estimated according to data from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).",5efa503b-be14-453b-8058-857dd0a45510
7,methods7," Anthropometric variables, such as weight and height, were measured by trained staff using calibrated scales and wall-mounted stadiometers, respectively. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Personal history related to chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes) was self-reported or collected from the medical records of participants. Depressive symptomology was evaluated based on Beck’s Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) with the threshold for depressive status risk established as a score ≥ 14 . The intervention group (treatment or control) and center size (<250, 250 to <300, 300 to <400, ≥400) of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus study were also considered as covariates.",515282e3-bd2c-49e5-8922-413eb70575f8

Data for dietary adherence scores (exposure variables) are presented as median (range). For the covariates and outcome variables, data are shown as percentages and mean ± standard deviation (SD), for qualitative and quantitative descriptive variables, respectively, and as β [95% confidence interval (CI)] for associations. Participants were classified according to tertiles of dietary pattern adherence, and the lowest tertile was used as the reference category. The chi-squared test and one-way ANOVA were used for qualitative and quantitative variables, respectively, to compare baseline characteristics according to dietary pattern adherence score.",c3fa3a6b-6f25-497c-89de-adb65b4a1e30
9,methods9,"  Longitudinal associations between adherences to the a priori dietary patterns of participants who completed each of the neuropsychological function tests were analyzed separately using multivariate linear regression. All analyses were conducted with robust estimates of the variance to correct for intracluster correlation. Crude and two adjusted models were assessed. The first model was minimally adjusted using established non-modifiable risk factor-related confounders for cognitive function (age, sex) along with intervention arm, study center size, respective baseline cognitive function score, and corrected for clusters (to account for couples living in the same household being randomized as a single unit). The second model was further adjusted for baseline education level (i.e., primary school, secondary school, or college), civil status (i.e., single, divorced or separated, married, or widower), smoking status (i.e.",64eacfcd-73f1-43c2-bc55-adc9e1f76053

The probability P for trend across categories of dietary pattern adherence score was calculated using the median value of each category as a continuous variable, and a two-tailed P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Several sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the findings and identify significant exposure factors to aid in developing priorities for risk mitigation. First, the removal of participants with a baseline Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≤ 23 indicated possible mild dementia (Dementia Care Central, 2020).",f0175fb8-7fcc-4298-8c87-59f2d798db55
11,methods11," Second, alcohol was added as a potential confounder in the models (despite being a component of the MedDiet and MedDiet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) patterns) as excessive alcohol intake is considered a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia . Third, analyses were conducted assessing the impact of individual food components of each dietary pattern using linear regression accounting for multicollinearity, if present. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata (14.0, StataCorp LP, TX, United States). ",4a9b1dae-03d2-4aab-b4d6-45b39bcbcfcc

Globally, dementia affects an estimated 50 million people, and this prevalence is projected to increase over 130 million by 2050 (World Health Organization [World Health Organization (WHO)], 2019). Epidemiological studies further suggest a negative interaction of aging and obesity with cognitive dysfunction . With the prevalence of overweight and obesity affecting an estimated 30% of the adult population and more, there are additional adverse implications for cognition health (Ng et al., 2014; Balasubramanian et al.",f8189fdf-75b2-4439-b31a-517d2ba5ff26
15,results4,", 2020). Cognitive decline carries a significant social and economic burden, given cognitive impairment and dementia are strong predictors of functional disability and dependence . Cognitive decline is a normal part of the aging process; however, the rate of decline may vary depending on the differences in genetic and lifestyle-related factors .  The potential of modifiable lifestyle factors is important as there are no effective pharmacological agents identified for the improvement of cognition or delay of the progression of cognitive decline . Diet is a key lifestyle risk factor. Individual nutrients and foods have been inconsistently associated with cognitive function, including some vitamins, carotenoids, long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as seafood, and whole foods rich in polyphenols, such as fruits and vegetables, nuts, olive oil, and coffee (Rutjes et al., 2018; Ammar et al.",8fd940c6-3f5b-40a7-8a64-208bbd99924c
16,results5,", 2020; Brainard et al., 2020). As food is consumed as part of a dietary pattern, it is important to consider the interactions and associations of whole dietary approaches. Three dietary patterns, in particular, are hypothesized to have a beneficial impact on cognitive function: the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)), and the MedDiet-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MedDiet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND)). The MedDiet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) are currently promoted for their cardiovascular benefits  yet may also be advisable to benefit cognition in themselves and because of the association of vascular risk factors with dementia risk .",f15a7cae-0d1b-41f9-94ba-552690add027
17,results6,"  Epidemiological studies and clinical trials have shown a relationship between adherence to MedDiet and cognitive function (Loughrey et al., 2017; Wu and Sun, 2017), and the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) has included this dietary pattern in their guidelines for risk reduction of cognitive decline and dementia; however, the strength of the recommendation is considered conditional (World Health Organization [World Health Organization (WHO)], 2019). A hybrid of the MedDiet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, the MedDiet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, is also being promoted for brain health, albeit it has been less extensively investigated in relation to cognition and other cardiometabolic health outcomes (van den Brink et al., 2019).",64ea364d-59b7-497d-b368-9a2de6680c11
18,results7," At any rate, dietary recommendations for preventing cognitive decline are still not widely accepted in guidelines due to conflicting and limited evidence. The MedDiet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and MedDiet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) dietary patterns each represent a modifiable lifestyle practice that could aid cognitive performance, yet further evidence is needed to inform cognitive guideline recommendations, as well as assess whether changes may be observed in a period of 2 years.",5922ffee-31c2-4371-b1ad-77c7f146cdeb

35,discussion3," Our study also found a positive association between higher adherence to MedDiet and a screening test (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) but also showed specific beneficial associations for executive functioning, including attention and processing speed (Trail Making Tests (TMT)-A) and cognitive flexibility (Trail Making Tests (TMT)-B). Conversely, a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (nine reports, five unique trials) showed inconsistent findings when comparing a MedDiet with either a waiting list, usual diet, or a low-fat control group for a duration ranging from 10 days to 6.5 years on cognition or brain morphology and function (Radd-Vagenas et al., 2018). However, the authors stated that significant and clinically meaningful effect sizes were found for cognitive composites in the largest and most robust trial, with a duration of 4.1 years, conducted within the context of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) trial (Valls-Pedret et al., 2015).",9befc953-37bc-4867-8f5d-cd63eba5c55b
36,discussion4," Furthermore, in a more recent analysis of a smaller sub-cohort of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus trial evaluating cognition, higher adherence to an energy-reduced MedDiet was associated with greater improvements in memory; however, interpretation of these findings was related to the interplay with weight loss (Soldevila-Domenech et al., 2021). In this study population, we did not find an association for the Global cognitive function (GCF), which may be explained by the short duration (2 years) and by the broad neuropsychological battery utilized compared with other studies. However, the present findings further support the MedDiet for better cognition while suggesting that beneficial associations may be observable within a shorter timeframe and have applicability for populations at greater risk of cognitive decline (older, with overweight or obesity, and at high risk of cardiovascular disease), which could have implications for improving quality of life.",22ecae9a-c6c9-4ab6-9588-42f1d4e5842a
37,discussion5," In particular, obesity and its comorbidities are associated with accelerated cognitive decline and impaired cognitive performance including neurodegenerative pathologies, such as dementia, in later life .  While a significant association was seen in the present analyses with the MedDiet and MedDiet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet within a shorter follow-up duration with some cognitive function assessments compared with other prospective cohort studies that have been conducted, this relationship was not found with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. While MedDiet has been associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment, it has not always been associated with a slower decline in cognitive function . Inconsistent findings have previously been observed with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (van den Brink et al., 2019).",c9e758cd-4926-4f7b-8be7-9036fcd84ff4
38,discussion6," However, MedDiet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) dietary adherence has been associated with better cognitive function across various domains in a systematic review of 13 MedDiet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) studies (9 cohorts, 3 cross-sectional, and 1 RCT) evaluating cognitive functioning in older adults (Kheirouri and Alizadeh, 2021). The observed discrepancies with present findings may be related to differences in the types of foods consumed by the study population, and a potential threshold effect related to the amount of each food component consumed, as well as the cognitive tests performed.  The analyzed three dietary patterns each have plant-based foundations, with moderate to high amounts of fish and dairy products, yet they differ in the types and amounts of each dietary component.",1807a552-9594-40b7-9518-6b7fe458e9a6
39,discussion7," The MedDiet is typically characterized by high consumption of olive oil, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, cereals, and unsaturated fatty acids; low consumption of meat and saturated fatty acids; low to moderate consumption of dairy products; moderate to high consumption of fish; and a regular, but moderate, intake of wine (Sánchez-Sánchez et al., 2020). The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet shares many similarities yet differs in recommending low-fat dairy and low sodium, besides having fewer specifications . Based on these two dietary patterns, the MedDiet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet was developed combining Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) aspects and incorporating purported neuroprotective foods such as green leafy vegetables and berries (Morris et al., 2015a,b).",7dde878d-de37-4ae1-88b2-b391180081bd
40,discussion8," A potential explanation for our discordant findings may be due to differences in the use of olive oil as the primary oil between tertiles of adherence. In our sample, the use of olive oil was clearly linked with a beneficial association in the Global cognitive function (GCF) composite, as well epidemiological and clinical evidence have suggested improved cognition with olive oil . With any dietary pattern, in addition to observing associations with specific food components, there is also the potential for synergistic effects .",2cf0bddf-6e72-460c-91ca-258df87d6b19
41,discussion9," The present findings suggest such effects given the observed associations for MedDiet with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Trail Making Tests (TMT)-A and Trail Making Tests (TMT)-B or the MedDiet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet with DST-b did not appear to be fully explained by any one component of the dietary pattern; however, further investigation is warranted.  Potential Mechanisms  The antioxidant, vitamin, probiotic, plant protein, and unsaturated fatty acid content along with low glycemic index/load components of the a priori dietary patterns studied have been proposed to possibly affect biological mechanisms of neurocognitive aging .",9df0a446-2963-4e0e-88da-150f5d0b9896
42,discussion10," These factors are thought to potentially lead to improved cognition through influencing vascular health and direct promotion of neuroprotection via anti-inflammatory mechanisms and reducing oxidative stress, ameliorating glycemic control, and supporting a favorable microbiome . Specifically, the observations with the MedDiet and changes in cognitive function may be related to synergistic or individual associations of specific foods, such as olive oil and nuts, due to associations of these foodstuffs with the above-mentioned mechanisms (Viguiliouk et al., 2014; Marcelino et al., 2019; Creedon et al., 2020).  Limitations and Strengths  There are several limitations to this research. First, the demographic profile of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus cohort, which is composed of predominantly white, older Spanish individuals with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity, may limit the generalizability of the results to other populations.",15fedded-1b3a-40ec-89d7-4928d364f0e0
43,discussion11," However, the homogeneity and the large sample size of the cohort increase the internal validity of the findings by avoiding potential confounding effects of socioeconomic status, educational level, and access to health care. Second, food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s tend to be limited concerning the variety of foods assessed, as compared to 24-h recalls and food records but are often more likely to reflect usual intake (Willett, 2012). The certainty in the dietary pattern scoring systems utilized may also be limited and experience restrictions due to a potential lack of direct alignment of food items and questions noted in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with each of the diet score components. food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s are also prone to misclassification and recall bias as they rely on the memory of participants. This is particularly important in a study of cognition when there could be a decline in cognitive function and memory deficits in the population.",55423523-04b3-467b-b789-ceb62af2f210
44,discussion12," However, due to the prospective nature of the study, baseline diet recall is unlikely to have been influenced by cognitive outcomes over the follow-up period, and baseline cognitive function was considered as a confounding variable. Another limitation is that the categorization of dietary pattern adherence was based on sample-specific cutoffs, and there are methodological differences among the various dietary scoring systems available, limiting comparability (van den Brink et al., 2019). Likewise, differences in the types of foods consumed by the study population, and the narrow range in scores between lowest and highest tertiles of intake, may have limited the ability to discern a difference, especially for the MedDiet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) pattern.",f4165736-25f2-4e94-9e7b-d1c3cdb26fa8
45,discussion13," Given that optimal or absolute minimum amounts of key foods for cognitive performance are still unclear, threshold amounts of foods for a neuroprotective effect may not have been reached in the present analyses especially in those consuming lower overall energy intake levels. In terms of cognitive assessments, while the use of a composite domain z-score may provide an overall global assessment of cognitive function, the component tests used to create these scores in other studies vary, thus making comparisons difficult. Also, a global screening tool may be less sensitive to detect possible associations due to a potential ceiling effect (Franco-Marina et al., 2010), hence potentially explaining the null associations observed with Global cognitive function (GCF).",166d4b5a-1ffb-46c9-8487-2d51b6ae2291
46,discussion14," Presenting this composite score in addition to the individual cognitive test assessments in this study provides a broader picture of the relationship of these dietary patterns with overall cognition and specific cognitive functions. Additionally, as an observational study, our analysis may be limited by the relatively short duration and is prone to residual confounding from factors not assessed in our models. Specifically, possible genetic interactions, such as with the apolipoprotein E E4 (ApoEε4) genotype, which has been associated with cognition, especially in the presence of hypercholesterolemia , was not able to be accounted for in the current analyses. Finally, a cause-effect relationship could not be determined due to the nature of the study design, as an observational cohort.",cc04dedc-e204-4b13-a9ee-0b7448f7ed25
47,discussion15,"  Nonetheless, this study is strengthened by the longitudinal analysis conducted in a large cohort using a comprehensive and thoroughly measured battery of cognitive tests that assess various function areas, as well as the use of an food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) developed and validated for an older Spanish population. The statistical models were also adjusted for multiple sociodemographic, economic, anthropometric, lifestyle, and biological confounders of the association between diet and cognition, while evaluation of the three distinct a priori dietary patterns within the same study cohort minimizes the effects of population-specific confounders or effect modifiers.",4055c6ff-50b9-44ea-973a-7f2f3818fc68
48,discussion16,"  Future Directions  Considering the limitations of the present analyses and inconsistencies observed in the literature, studies, especially randomized controlled trials, accounting for relevant genotypes, use of dietary compliance biomarkers such as via the development of diet-specific metabolomes, and undertaking standardized neuropsychological assessments including biomarkers and neuroimaging would be useful for future research.  Conclusion  In older Spanish adults with overweight or obesity, higher adherence to the MedDiet may help mitigate the risk of cognitive decline, specifically as it relates to general and executive cognitive functioning, even over a short (2-year) period.
