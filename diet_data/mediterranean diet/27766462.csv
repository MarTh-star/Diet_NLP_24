0,introduction0,"The increase in lifestyle-related diseases, especially type 2 diabetes, caused by obesity has become a worldwide problem, even in developing countries. The beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet on human health are well established from many epidemiological studies.(1–4) Consequently, the phenolic compounds in olive oil, a major source of dietary fat in the Mediterranean diet, have been gaining interest.(5–7)  Oleuropein (Fig. 1), a nontoxic secoiridoid compound derived from olives and olive oil, is responsible for their typical bitter and pungent aroma.(8,9) Its biochemical functions, including antimicrobial,(9,10) antioxidative,(6,11,12) and anticancer activities(13–15) have been reported. Several in vitro studies have demonstrated oleuropein to have higher antioxidant activity than a hydro-soluble analog of tocopherol and inhibitory activity against the proliferation and migration of various cancer cell lines.",98951fa3-1478-4718-b4b0-23f944974691
1,introduction1,"(16,17)  Oleuropein is also known to prevent the progression of hepatic steatosis.(18–20) Poudyal et al.(21) reported that olive leaf extracts contain polyphenols such as oleuropein and its major metabolite, hydroxytyrosol, which ameliorate the cardiovascular, hepatic, and metabolic symptoms in rat models with obesity and diabetes induced by high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets (high fat diets (HFD)). Olive leaf extracts were reported to lower blood cholesterol(22) and lipid concentrations(23) in cholesterol-fed rats.  Oleuropein attenuates visceral adiposity in mice with high fat diets (HFD)-induced obesity(24) and reverses the high fat diets (HFD)-induced elevations of adipogenesis-related gene expression.(24) Oi-Kano et al.(25) suggested that oleuropein enhanced thermogenesis by increasing the level of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in interscapular brown adipose tissue and secretion of noradrenalin and adrenaline.",86199f82-e257-4007-be66-5484cf16a163
2,introduction2," Oleuropein was also reported to inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes.(24,26,27)  In diabetes studies, oleuropein is known to decrease blood glucose level in alloxan-induced diabetic rats(28) and rabbits.(29) Recently, Murotomi et al.(30) used the Tsumura Suzuki Obese Diabetes mouse as a diabetic phenotype of type 2 diabetes phenotype and showed that the oleuropein rich diet attenuated hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance without any effect on obesity. However, its effect has not been fully documented for type 2 diabetes caused by obesity.  Therefore, to determine the effect of oleuropein on the glucose tolerance caused in type 2 diabetes and obesity, its effects in skeletal muscle under the lipotoxic condition were examined using C2C12 cells and gastrocnemius muscles of mice fed a high fat diet.

11,results0,"Oleuropein-induced glucose uptake in C2C12 myotube cells by induction of GLUT4 Figure 2A shows the levels of 3[H]-deoxy-glucose uptake into C2C12 for 30 min in the presence of 1, 10 and 100 µM oleuropein. Oleuropein (10 µM) was found to be sufficient to enhance the uptake of 3[H]-deoxy-glucose by 1.4-fold, the similar as insulin. We also evaluated the glucose incorporation into cells by measurement of decrease in concentrations of glucose in medium for 4-h incubation (Fig. 2B), and confirmed the similar results. No further induction by oleuropein in the presence of insulin was observed (Fig. 2C).  As shown in Fig. 3, expression levels of GLUT4 mRNA in C2C12 cells were not significant differences between control and oleuropein treatment, however, Western blot analysis revealed oleuropein to have induced a 1.8-fold increase in the expression of GLUT4 protein in C2C12 plasma membrane, whereas insulin increased by two-fold.",cafa4bc1-0e12-4232-956a-e2657c1b8a64
12,results1," These results suggest that oleuropein induces the amounts of GLUT4 protein into the cell surface and consequently increases the glucose uptake.  Effect of oleuropein on signal transduction to promote GLUT4 translocation As oleuropein induces glucose uptake, the effect on the phosphorylation of Akt, which is downstream of the insulin signal, was investigated to elucidate its mechanism. As shown in Fig. 4A, insulin activates Akt significantly, whereas oleuropein does not increase the phosphorylation of Akt despite results showing 10 µM oleuropein to have an effect equivalent to that of 100 nM insulin in inducing glucose uptake (Fig. 4A). activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, another signaling pathway was also examined. Figure 4B shows that oleuropein activates activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation significantly at 10 µM, and its effect was found to be similar to that of 500 µM AICAR, which is the activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator.",d31584e0-e379-4c11-a328-9b4d10a41f65
13,results2,"  Oleuropein improved lipotoxicity of C2C12 induced by palmitic acid The amount of cellular incorporation of glucose was evaluated in C2C12 cells with 250 µM palmitic acid as the model of insulin resistance induced by obesity (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5A, addition of insulin enhanced glucose incorporation into C2C12 cells by 2.5-fold whereas palmitic acid inhibited the increase by insulin; however, oleuropein recovered the glucose incorporation in the presence of insulin. It suggested that oleuropein improved insulin resistance of C2C12 cells. Although palmitic acid decreased the phosphorylation of activated protein kinase (AMPK) in C2C12 significantly, oleuropein was observed to enhance the phosphorylation of activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the presence of 250 µM palmitic acid (Fig. 5B).  Oleuropein enhanced GLUT4 translocation in vivo  To determine whether the effect of oleuropein on skeletal muscle would be reproducible in vivo.",f5420b31-c817-4940-b0bc-5303d9ac5757
14,results3," High fat feeding increased the body weights and white adipose tissues; however, the body weights and white adipose tissue weights of oleuropein (OLE)-fed mice were similar to those of high fat diets (HFD)-fed mice (Table 2). Average amount food intake of high fat diets (HFD) and oleuropein (OLE) was 3.87 ± 0.19 g/mouse/week and 3.84 + 0.19 g/mouse/week, respectively. Oleuropein supplementation was not shown any adverse effect. Results of Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were expressed as AUC (area under curve) in Table 2, showing no significant changes between oleuropein (OLE) and high fat diets (HFD). In oleuropein (OLE)-fed mice, fasting blood glucose levels were lower than HDF mice. Insulin resistance evaluated as HOMA-IR was significantly improved in oleuropein (OLE)-fed mice compared to high fat diets (HFD)-fed mice (Table 2).  Figure 6 showed the GLUT4 protein localization in gastrocnemius muscles by immunohistochemistry using a confocal laser scanning microscope.",0efb3172-a187-4571-aa68-97e346fea7f0
15,results4," GLUT4 signals in the high fat diets (HFD) group were localized in both cell membrane and cytoplasm, they were weakly detected in some cells. In the oleuropein (OLE) group, on the contrary, GLUT4 signals were more frequently observed in almost all muscle cells. GLUT4 was mainly distributed in the cell membrane and several vesicular signals were also detected in the cytoplasm. It suggested that orally ingested oleuropein promoted GLUT4 membrane translocation in the gastrocnemius muscle under the lipotoxic condition. ",8fd1c79b-0915-470c-9de1-0e8e9e67934a
16,discussion0,"In this study, we investigated the effect of oleuropein on the skeletal muscle, which is important for glucose uptake and for maintaining normal blood glucose levels. As shown in Fig. 2, 10 µM oleuropein was sufficient to enhance glucose uptake in C2C12 cells, by inducing activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, but not Akt. Oleuropein did not show the synergistic effect with insulin (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the regulation of GLUT4 by activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling is independent from insulin signal. Similar results were reported recently by Hadrich et al.,(33) who assessed the phosphorylation of activated protein kinase (AMPK), Akt, IRS (insulin receptor substrate), and GLUT4 at oleuropein concentrations of 200–400 µM. However, we used much lower concentration (10 µM) and demonstrated it to be sufficient to express beneficial effects on C2C12 cells. Kano et al.",9b1b5d7e-92a5-427e-bd23-59a67ab289e8
17,discussion1,"(34) reported that 10 µM oleuropein was detected in plasma of rat after 240 min of oral administration (10 mg/kg). Therefore the concentration of oleuropein we used in this study is supposed to be physiological condition.  Hadrich et al.(33) also showed that reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) produced by hydrogen peroxide decreased on pre-treatment with oleuropein, and suggested that oleuropein activated activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation via its anti-oxidative function. Oxidative stress is generally believed to be a mediator of insulin resistance, because hyperglycemia has been implicated in the activation of several major signal transduction pathways, such as NFκB, JNK/SAPKs, and p38 MAPK.(35,36) However, the mechanism of activation of activated protein kinase (AMPK) by oleuropein is still unclear. Sato et al.",f5149cc7-a366-4b05-9fbf-7d10a50c0c83
18,discussion2,"(37) demonstrated the possibility of oleuropein and oleanoic acid acting as agonists for transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), a receptor activated by bile acid and supposed that be involved in the anti-diabetic effect of olive oil. Some studies suggest that oleuropein inhibits PPARγ expression.(26,27) Further study on the molecular target of oleuropein is essential.  Oleuropein is known to partially metabolize to tyrsol and hydroxyltyrosol.(38) These metabolites possess stronger anti-oxidative activity than oleuropein.(39) Although we did not compare the effect of oleuropein with that of its metabolites, oleuropein itself was clearly shown to induce GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane and glucose uptake into the cells.",c55e0ae5-ea74-4fb1-8da5-fc9e576a683e
19,discussion3,"  Lipotoxicity, characterized by a high concentration of non-esterified fatty acid and induced especially by palmitic acid in blood, aggravates not only insulin tolerance and beta cell function, but also whole body inflammation in type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome caused by obesity.(40) Therefore, C2C12 cells treated with palmitic acid were used in this study as a model of lipotoxicity and insulin resistance caused by obesity. As shown in Fig. 5, oleuropein improved insulin sensitivity in C2C12 cells treated with high concentrations of palmitic acid. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is well known to link to high fat induced insulin resistance.(41,42) TLR2 is thought to be essential for insulin resistance induced by palmitic acid in C2C12 cells,(43) however, it is not clearly known whether activated protein kinase (AMPK) and TLRs are connected.",76dc1168-706b-434a-afb7-3272b4ea9483
20,discussion4," Although we measured the mRNA expression levels of IL6 (interleukin 6), cytokine in down-stream of the TLR4 signals, treatment of oleuropein did not change the levels significantly between with and without palmitic acid (data not shown). As we could not clarify the details how oleuropein improves insulin resistance in the presence of palmitic acid in this study, so far, further studies will be needed.  Although the effect of oleuropein on type 1 diabetes using rats(28) and rabbits(29) administered with alloxan has already been reported to protect the liver and serum from oxidative stress,(28) its effect on type 2 diabetes mellitus caused by obesity has not yet been fully understood.  Some studies have demonstrated the anti-obesity and anti-hypolipidemic effects of oleuropein.",d84b8ec7-ac3f-4342-be13-2839afeffd2b
21,discussion5,"(21,24) In Wistar rats fed a high-carbohydrate and high fat diets (HFD) for 16 weeks, treatment with olive leaf extracts including oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol reduced abdominal fat circumference and fat pads without changing body weights in either of the two groups.(21) Oi-Kano et al.(25,44) reported oleuropein-activated thermogenesis through UCP1 expression and beta adrenalin receptors. In our study, oleuropein (OLE)-fed mice showed no significant difference in body weights compared high fat diets (HFD)-fed mice, however, immuno histochemical analysis clearly showed that oral intake of oleuropein promoted GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle as shown by results in C2C12 cells.  Human study that evaluated olive oil or Mediterranean diet demonstrated its beneficial effects on cardiovascular health and metabolic syndrome.(45,46) The data examining the effect of olive polyphenols on glucose homeostasis are limited; however, de Bock et al.",05f8e411-9f0f-4b4b-9269-c682b7706d76
22,discussion6,(47) reported the effectiveness of oleuropein against type 2 diabetes mellitus induced by obesity in a randomized controlled study in humans. We suggest that one of the mechanisms of oleuropein might be improvement of insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle by stimulation of GLUT4 translocation independently of insulin signals. ,fe92be34-2b04-47e5-9d22-e6c9e8aa3064
