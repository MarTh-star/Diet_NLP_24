0,introduction0,"Irritable bowel syndrome (Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 11.2% (1). The condition is characterised by recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits as per the diagnostic Rome IV criteria (1). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with decreased quality of life, social productivity, and work performance. Furthermore, Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) not only poses a financial burden to the individual through the cost of seeking medical advice but also impacts the healthcare system by time and resources acquired by patients (2). Nearly 40% of primary care and gastroenterologist visits can be attributed to Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (3).",bb12df58-e6f5-4168-9172-c645ff3753d0
1,introduction1,"  Diet, specifically the widely recognized low fermentable, oligosaccharide-, disaccharide-, monosaccharide-, and polyol (fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP)) diet (low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD)), has been a cornerstone therapy for Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) involves three phases; a ‘fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) restriction phase’ lasting 4–8 weeks, a ‘re-introduction and challenge phase’ lasting 6–10 weeks, and a ‘personalization phase’ where tolerated fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP)s are returned to the diet (4). Several studies have shown the diet to be efficacious in the management of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms (5, 6).",d3aed736-f276-41a2-a753-bb41377bf1fd
2,introduction2," However, data still suggest that approximately 30% of individuals do not respond to this management option (7). Furthermore, the safety of the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) has been questioned in regard to its nutritional adequacy, decreased fiber intake, and potential negative impact on the gut microbiome (8).  The major mechanistic pathways via which fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP)s induce symptoms in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are via osmotic load and colonic gas production in the setting of visceral hypersensitivity and have been reviewed in depth elsewhere (9). In addition, the gut-brain axis has emerged as an important mechanistic pathway directly modulable through various therapies. This axis is a bidirectional interconnection of the vagal and sacral parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent nerves interacting with the enteric nervous system.",164bcbe6-7dd5-4ea3-aa4a-9b787273bde3
3,introduction3," The higher brain center can receive signals from the enteric intrinsic, external vagal, and spinal afferents. Dysregulation of this pathway can be attributed to depression, anxiety, and psychological stress (10). Signals relayed between the gut and the brain suggest that Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is responsive to cognitive and emotive triggers such as stress, anxiety, and depression. Given that psychosocial factors are seen in a high proportion of individuals with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), it could explain the refractory response to dietary management of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in some patients. Abnormalities in the central sensory processing in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients has become the target for non-dietary related therapies. Psychological therapies (including cognitive therapy and gut-directed hypnotherapy) have shown promise in significantly improving Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in adults suffering Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (11).",5dfd7cf1-c53b-4a59-a8df-c14ed1934500
4,introduction4,"  Despite several treatment options showing good efficacy for Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) management, particularly in the case of the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD), there is still much to understand about tailoring the right treatment (whether psychotherapy or diet should be employed as a first line therapy, or a combination of both) to the individual patient. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) compared with non-dietary treatments, in reducing symptoms and improving bowel function, as well as safety considerations such as nutritional adequacy and effects on the colonic microbiota.",1c2c4dcf-e944-4a68-ac72-079901919395
5,introduction5," The findings will provide insight into strengths, limitations, and application of the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) compared with other dietary and non-dietary interventions, thereby addressing gaps in the literature and future directions for the management of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

34,results26,"  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Subtype Response to Treatment The Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-D subtype showed a positive response to the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) at 1 week (13) and 6 weeks (16). One study (14) showed that at 4 weeks, the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) had the following changes; 14 of 16 Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-D showed an improvement in bowels, 7 of 10 with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-C showed bowel improvement, and of eight with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-M, two participants showed improvement, one worsened, and two had no changes. The remaining participants were all Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-U, undefined at baseline (15).",3c1fe4f4-881d-4def-8283-3a2e9ceaaa54
35,results27," These findings suggest that the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) benefits each Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subtype, most consistently for Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-D.  Delivery of Dietary Intervention Given the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) approach is comprehensive due to the elimination, reintroduction, and personalization of the diet, there are potential risks if the diet is not implemented safely. Alterations to gastrointestinal microbiota and nutritional adequacy have been noted after just 4 weeks of a low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD), which is concerning given that the initial restriction phase is usually 6 weeks (4). Personalized dietary advice from a dietitian has been positively associated with compliance and success (21).",03d86b45-5a63-4f6d-800b-cd7af6ef4106

Additionally, a major factor in determining the success of the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) was the provision of written resources to facilitate implementing the diet (22). There were varying degrees of contact with the dietitian where some participants received 45 to 90 min on a single occasion or up to four sessions in either an individual or group setting. In some studies, there was limited contact with the dietitian to replicate clinical practice.",b590843f-7688-47f3-8126-acd6f462a81e
37,results29," Commonly noted feedback to study personnel were that participants found the diet relatively easy to follow, but the translation of low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) foods into recipes was difficult. One study, which had the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) food resource prepared in accordance with Iranian culture, found that adherence was considered difficult; however, it was not reported as a problem in the trial (16). Adherence with the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) was associated with achieving a clinically important value of a reduction in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-SSS ≥50 (12).",46104019-b7bf-4568-85ba-8d1780945b06
38,results30,"  For the other dietary interventions, there was insufficient detail provided to ascertain whether participants received the same level of care as those receiving a low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD). Therefore, the quality of dietetic care is less comparable to those who received low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) intervention, and there is insufficient insight what participants were specially instructed to do to elicit symptomatic relief.

Several bacterial groups decreased after following the high fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (HFD), with the exception of the Bifidobacteriaceae family and unclassed family within the Lachnospiraceae family, which increased (14). On a species level, the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) compared with the sham diet produced lower absolute abundance of Bifidobacterium (p = 0.08).",c00f82e6-de95-4205-9321-dfcfce06f12f
41,results33," The low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) did not produce a difference in relative abundance of the Streptococcus species or the Lactobacillus species compared to the sham diet between baseline and follow-up (17). These findings suggest that the alpha and beta diversity may not be impacted by the implementation of a low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD); however, at a species level, the results are inconsistent.  Subgroup Analysis When the Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subtypes Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-M and IBD-D (both groups having some diarrhoea) were analyzed, there was a greater bacterial richness in those following the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) compared to the high fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (HFD) (p = 0.047).",b7f7f267-4dd1-493f-941a-44631ed1a564

43,results35,  Delivery of Dietary Intervention One study compared a low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) to probiotic use whereby participants were seen by either a dietitian or nutritionist (18). Dietary counselling was provided for up to one hour (18) with a complex list of appropriate foods provided by a dietitian (18). Dietary compliance was regularly checked and contact with the dietitian was encouraged (18). Probiotics were administered in capsules (18) whereby participants consumed two capsules each day.  Effects on Microbiome Data on the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) and probiotic on microbiome was not reported (18).  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Subtype Response to Treatment The Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-D subtype showed a positive response to the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) at 6 weeks (18).,d1354624-d1e8-4ca2-8e4f-1f93586eea44

Bristol Stool Form Scale Neither of the studies that assessed non-dietary interventions used the Bristol stool form scale as an outcome.  Delivery of Intervention The participants receiving gut-directed hypnotherapy were allocated 1 h weekly sessions throughout the 6-week study duration. Each participant received the same script that was also recorded and given to the participants to listen to daily for the duration of the study.

47,discussion0,"This review highlights that the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) is efficacious in the management of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Despite its success, several considerations need to be addressed regarding its use. While there has been greater understanding of the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) and its mechanism in practice with recent research, there is still a consensus that further understanding of the diet’s implications are needed.  Gaps of interest include a deeper understanding on the long-term effects of the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) on gut microbiota diversity. It should be established whether a change in the microbiota profile can be attributed to a mediated symptom response (8, 14).",d8cc4b35-339a-4afa-b1c4-3816728f1856
48,discussion1," Although recent reviews indicate that baseline microbiota may not be an accurate predictor of symptom improvement in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (23), the volatile organic compound profile may very accurately select responders, suggesting that understanding metabolic function of bacteria is more important for determining response to dietary interventions (24). Modulation of gut microbiota with the use of pre- and probiotics while implementing the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) should be considered. While prebiotics can infer a symptomatic response in some individuals, it should be ascertained whether a less restrictive low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) mitigates the negative impact on the microbiota.",7b66a66a-9f74-4a7a-9860-40e1030a2449
49,discussion2,"  From a safety perspective, calorie and nutrient inadequacies have been acknowledged when following the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD). Therefore, excessive restrictions such as the avoidance of complete food groups should be averted (25). The implementation of the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) is extensive and requires education from a qualified nutrition professional (4). Where the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) may not be appropriate or possible, other dietary strategies can be considered. Evidence suggests that simple strategies such as a reduction in gut stimulants (caffeine, alcohol, and spicy food) and modulation of meal size and frequency may also be effective.",bbcb31ba-42a4-46bc-b7b5-ba314472e210
50,discussion3," However, it should be noted that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines include recommendations such as reducing polyols, onions, cabbage, and beans and limiting fruit to three portions per day. Despite being considered as generalized dietary advice, these foods contain fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP)s, which is why a reduction in symptoms may be concurrent if following this advice. Furthermore, dietitians instructed participants in one study who were not randomized to the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) to limit consumption of foods that contribute to perceived detrimental symptoms (16).",afc322c3-b6dd-459d-8dd0-20ecdb8b0092
51,discussion4," While the dietitians did not advise these participants to restrict fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP)s specifically, it is unknown if any foods restricted did contain fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP)s, which could have contributed to symptom improvement. From a practical perspective, it appears there is still a need for data on the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) when followed for a long duration.  Cognitive considerations in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) also warrant further investigation. The mechanisms in which gut directed hypnotherapy exert an effect on the gut are not fully understood but suggest the control and normalisation of gastrointestinal function can be made to the subconscious mind. Peters et al.",00cae4bb-5853-438b-aa0f-c5c779e94dca
52,discussion5," found that improved psychological indices were not correlated with symptomatic benefit, although the study was not designed to evaluate mechanisms for efficacy; therefore, further understanding the mechanisms of gut hypnotherapy on symptom improvement is needed (19).  Despite results from Peters et al. that a combination of dietary and psychological interventions showed no additive benefits, areas for further research would be further exploring combining dietary and other non-dietary interventions. Tailored advice based on an individual’s current dietary intake and other psychosocial factors should help to inform a management plan. Given that the gut microbiota have an established role in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the gut-brain axis (26), combined dietary and cognitive treatments should be examined to determine the relationship between concurrent changes to the gut microbiota and symptom resolution.",601728d0-0987-48f5-ad4a-dad57e305c94
53,discussion6,"  This review highlighted a heterogeneity in low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) study designs and in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patient selection, including a lack of inclusion or reporting of specific Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-subtypes. Regardless, the findings demonstrate consistencies in the evidence that the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) is efficacious in overall symptom and bowel function improvement for each Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subtype, allowing practical application across the distribution of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patterns.",402db0a0-4649-427a-9eea-6e62891fb063
54,discussion7,"  In conclusion, the low fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) is efficacious in reducing symptoms when compared to other dietary and non-dietary treatments, however it remains difficult to understand why some individuals respond to certain treatments while others do not. Future research should focus on identifying which treatment modality specifically or in which combination via a multimodal approach is best suited to an individual with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), including short- and long-term effects. Current dietary intake and symptom pattern of an individual in conjunction with current psychosocial state regarding depression, anxiety, and stress should be measured to best inform whether dietary or cognitive therapies are likely to be more effective in the management of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
