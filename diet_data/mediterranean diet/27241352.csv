As a result, we decided to stratify the articles into Mediterranean versus non-Mediterranean study participants.  3.2. MD and Cognitive Function 3.2.1. Cross Sectional Studies Six cross-sectional studies examined the effect of adhering to the traditional Mediterranean diet on overall cognitive function. Three studies showed significant association [37,38,39]; however, the results of the other three studies did not detect any association between MD and memory [34,35,36].

8,methods8," The Mini-Mental State Examination (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) assessed five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. In all age groups, higher adherence to the MD was associated with higher Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, (p = 0.012) (Table 2) [37]. The second study was done by Zbeida et al. [39] and included participants from 2 cohort studies, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)) and the Israeli National Health and Nutrition Survey (MABAT-ZAHAV). In both cohorts, the MD was associated with significantly better scores in the Wechsler adult intelligence scale. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and MABAT ZAHAV studies, participants in the highest tertile of the MD score respectively had mean intelligence scores of 46.46 ± 18.12 and 31.27 ± 3.25, compared to means of 39.69 ± 18.52 and 30.",41e1bccf-1e55-4f52-a418-40f62d6afbf8

Among both sexes, MD scores were not associated with cognitive function [34]. Lastly, a study that was part of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 Study (LBC1936) also used the 0–9 MD score and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), National Adult Reading Test (National Adult Reading Test (NART)) and Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR)) cognitive tests. The MD was associated with better verbal ability in both the National Adult Reading Test (NART) and Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR), p = 0.024 and 0.001 respectively. However, after adjusting for all possible covariates the MD was not shown to be associated with memory status, p = 0.870 [36].  3.2.2.

For every 1-point increase in the MD score, participants had fewer errors on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) test (p = 0.04) [50]. The second study in France was part of the Supplementation with Vitamins and Mineral Antioxidants (SU.VI.MAX) study.

A more recent set of cohort studies were published in 2015; two studies used a Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) [52,56] to assess dietary intake and calculate Trichopoulou’s 0–9 MD score. As part of the Greek European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) prospective cohort study, participants enrolled between 1996–1999, were part of the final study.

In another study, the Nutritional aspect of the Spanish prospective cohort (SUN project) started in 2008, and 823 volunteers, aged 55+ years, participated in the study. Two Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS-m) were conducted to assess cognitive function. Participants in the bottom two tertiles of the MD adherence scores had higher cognitive decline than participants with the highest scores [52].

(2) Studies in the non- Mediterranean Region  The first study in a non-Mediterranean country took place in the USA, Tangney et al. and participants were from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP)). Cognitive function was assessed by East Boston tests of immediate and delayed recall, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (attention, visual scanning, tracking and motor speed). Higher MD scores were significantly associated with slower rates of cognitive decline. Results remained significant even after people with the lowest baseline cognitive scores or heart diseases were excluded [54].",0780d18e-69bf-4cc0-84c2-bdc22f491441

Another similar study cohort study; however, for a longer follow up period as part of the Cache County Memory Study (Cache County Memory Study (CCMS)) showed similar results. Participants with the highest adherence to the MD, scored higher on the Modified Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (3MS) test as compared to those with the lowest adherence (p-trend = 0.0022) [57].

However, only the upper tertile of the MD score was associated with slower decline rates in episodic, semantic, working memory and global cognitive change domains [55]. The final study in the USA was part of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) prospective study. After 8 years of follow up, significant results were observed only among black participants; participants with higher MD scores had slower rate of cognitive decline (95% CI: 0.05–0.39 p = 0.01) [53].

The first study that did not detect significance took place in Canberra, Australia, and as part of the Personality & Total Health (Personality & Total Health (PATH)) Through Life study, and included both men and women. Participants administered the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving) to assess cognitive function. However, MD did not have any protective effect against cognitive decline [42].

20,methods20," MD was only associated with AD development among the APOE ε4 allele carrier but not among the general participants [47].  Four cohort studies in the USA; all of which only included female participants, did not show any significant association between adherence to the MD and cognitive decline. The first study was part of the Women’s Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study (Women’s Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study (WACS)) and included 2504 female health professionals. During the 5.4 years of follow up, no significant results were observed between participants with different levels of adherence to the Mediterranean diet and their rate of cognitive decline [46]. Samieri’s study included 16,058 female nurses that underwent various cognitive tests: TICS (verbal memory, orientation/mental tracking, language/reasoning, and attention/working memory), immediate and delayed recalls of the East Boston Memory test (East Boston Memory test (EBMT)) (verbal memory), category fluency and digit span-backward.",a52a174b-da07-4b20-9915-ff6709fc496f

However, adherence to the MD was linearly significantly associated with better overall cognitive function (p = 0.004, 0.002, <0.001 for TICS, global cognition and verbal memory respectively) [44]. The second study also by Samieri et al. included 6174 women health professionals, recruited as part of the Women’s Health Study in the USA. Similarly, the results did not show any significant association [45]. The final study was by Haring et al., as part of the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS)), examined the effect of 9 years of following a MD on cognitive decline.

22,methods22," Studies That Detected Significance Five studies assessed the effect of adherence to the MD on the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease; four of which showed significant results. The first study was published by Scarmeas et al. in 2009, and participants in this study were part of the Washington/Hamilton Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP I–II). Participants in the third tertile of adherence to the MD had a 51% lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, HR = 0.49 (0.29, 0.85) (p = 0.01) [60]. In a more recent cohort study by Morris et al., part of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (Memory and Aging Project (MAP)) in Chicago, people with the highest adherence to the MD, highest tertile for MD score, had a 54% lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, compared to those in the lowest tertile. This association remained significant even after adjusting for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), HR = 0.49 95% CI (0.29, 0.85) [63]. Similar to by Scarmeas et al., Gu et al.",8dfa233f-ca12-4c90-8e96-7d50488231a0
23,methods23," examined a subgroup of the WHICAP II study. Participants in the greatest adherence to the MD had marginally better cognitive results β = 0.013 (p = 0.05). After 4 years of following a MD, longitudinal analysis showed that participants within the highest tertile of adherence to the MD had a 34% less risk of developing AD [64]. Another cross-sectional study took place in Australia was part of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing (and Lifestyle study (AIBL)) study and included participants that were either healthy, had mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) or AD. Participants that had AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) had lower MD score than cognitively healthy participants (p < 0.001 and <0.05 respectively). Every 1-unit increase in the MD score was associated with 13–19% and 19–26% decrease in odds in being in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD category respectively.",0cb3f60d-dc7b-4e55-a6c2-c59a5d4ca9c3
24,methods24," Out of the 4 cognitive tests used, only the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) test showed significant results; in which participants with the highest MD scores achieved best on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), p = 0.014 [59]. Lastly, results, from a study that included 192 individuals residing in New York, showed a protective effect of MD against mortality risk in the study population. Moreover, AD patients with higher MD adherence scores, compared to those with the lowest scores had a 74% lower risk of mortality, 95% CI = 0.10–0.69 [62].  3.3.2. Studies That Did Not Detect Significance The only study that did not detect a significant association between MD and AD development was a Swedish cohort study as part of the Uppsala longitudinal study of adult men. This study used a modified MD score, this score is similar to Trichopoulou’s 0–9 MD score but does not include nuts. After 12 years of follow up, the MD was not associated with AD prevention, HR = 1.00 95% CI (0.75, 1.",97e728f6-16da-476c-8da2-e2282d0d4432
25,methods25,"33) [61].  4. Discussion This evidence-based systematic review examined the efficacy of the Mediterranean diet against cognitive decline and dementia. Results from published articles show mixed results, especially among cross-sectional studies. Cohort studies show a discrepancy in the usefulness of adherence to the MD in studies taking place in the Mediterranean versus non- Mediterranean regions. However, cohort studies published in the Mediterranean region show encouraging results. These results are further reinforced by two Spanish randomized controlled trials that also showed promising results.  4.1. Variations in Dietary Scores and Cognitive Tests All cross-sectional studies used Trichopoulou’s MD score except for one study that used Panagiotakos’s MD score. The two scoring criteria have been used intensively in the literature, and they have been found to be reliable and valid tools to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet [8,17,65,66].",5642f85b-4577-4dba-9fcf-ecf1994b31d2
26,methods26," The usage of either of the two MD scores did not seem to affect the association between adherence to the MD and over-all cognitive function. However, given that different cognitive tests measure different domains of cognition; the choice of the cognitive test used might have affected this association. The three cross-sectional studies that showed a significant association used the following cognitive tests: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Wechsler adult intelligence scale. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most commonly used cognitive screening tool in research articles [67,68], and, compared to other brief tests, it is the best tool to detect dementia [69]. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a measure of orientation, attention, calculation, recall, and language; whereas, the Wechsler adult intelligence scale is a measure of IQ.",3fb6244a-da9d-4767-a238-b75958c1a09c
27,methods27," The three studies that did not detect significance used the CSI-D, Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ)/Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ) as well as Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). CSI-D measures: memory, executive function, language function, visual context/ visual-spatial; Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ)/Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ) measure memory, absent-mindedness, or slips of action, attentiveness. The Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ)/Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ) tests used by Crichton et al. (2013) and the CSI-D test used by Chan et al. (2013) were self-reported by participants in the study, this fact might have also affected the significance of the association between MD and cognition [34,35]. Another possible reason for not detecting significance in Crichton’s study could be that their study participants had the lowest mean age among all the cross-sectional studies.",2028ae4a-d0c4-446c-8d6c-a07f51999c6f
28,methods28," The MD might have a stronger effect on cognitive health later in life rather than earlier on. Additionally, all studies that used Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) test reported significant results, except for one study by Corley et al. (2013) [36]. This particular study was the only cross-sectional study that accounted for childhood IQ and added it into their covariate analysis. People with better childhood IQ may be more health aware and tend to follow a healthier dietary lifestyle. The later shows childhood cognitive function and IQ could mediate and affect the link between MD and later life cognition.  4.2. Variations in Age and Follow up Duration All cohort studies included participants with a mean age of at least 52 years; therefore, age did not seem to be a factor that affected the significance of the association between MD and cognitive function over time. Most cohort studies used Trichopoulou’s MD score.",7aa604d3-6b4c-4004-b3a9-20603ff3d89d
29,methods29," Studies that detected significance ranged in follow up periods between 4–13 years; similarly, studies that did not detect any significance had a ranged in follow up periods between 3–13 years (Table 3). However, the longest duration study linking MD to the risk of developing AD didn’t show any significance. In that particular study, researchers did not assess intake of nuts. Nuts are a substantial contributor to the benefits of the MD, and have been associated with lower risks of cognitive decline [40,41]. Both cohort studies that took place in Australia had the briefest follow up periods and did not show significant results [42,47].  4.3. Variations in Study Region and Gender Out of the five cohort studies in the Mediterranean region, only one did not show a significant association. This study was published by Psaltopoulou et al.",9c04f6a3-36d6-4b8f-88d7-90366cbbb4a6
30,methods30," (2008) and a possible reason for not having significant results could be that they did not collect baseline data for their participants, all other studies had baseline data available [48]. In contrast, studies in the non-Mediterranean region showed mixed results; out of the 12 cohorts included in this review, six did not show significant results. It is important to note that four out of the six studies in the non-Mediterranean region that did not detect significance included only female participants (Table 2). This shows that the MD could exert differential effects on cognition depending on gender. Studies with both male and female participants show significant results; however, these results are attenuated among female only participants. Similar findings are shown in animal studies, researchers tend to use male animals more than females given that females are more diverse due to hormonal changes and are less likely to show significant results [70].",393f13d8-0131-4163-9514-10cb52124bf3
31,methods31,"  Another possible reason for this inconsistency in results in the non-Mediterranean region could be that the MD adherence scores were developed to assess dietary intake of people living in the Mediterranean area. Better results would be displayed if the scores were tailored to different populations taking into account the food intake and availability in that particular country. Another reason could be that the Mediterranean diet is observed as a lifestyle rather than just a diet. This lifestyle includes people eating together, and food is considered a social event that brings family and friends together. People in the Mediterranean region are also physically active, and conduct moderate physical activity for at least 30 min per day [71]. Physical activity also exerts a protective role against cognitive decline [72].",36520590-1f70-45c5-86d5-d898671d7763
32,methods32," This shows that studies examining the effect of diet on cognition need to take physical activity as a possible confounder to this association, and physical activity data needs to be collected.  Collectively, 10 cohort studies, including 35,618 participants included in this review show that adherence to the MD could have a preventative effect on cognitive decline over time. All of these studies had baseline data available and used numerous cognitive tests that assessed the following cognitive domains: concentration, orientation, attention, calculation, recall, language, episodic memory, verbal memory, working memory, long-term memory, visual memory, abstract thinking, category fluency, semantic verbal fluency, tracking and motor speed. Overall, cohort studies show promising effects in which the MD could be an easy and sustainable method in delaying and in some cases preventing dementia.",d39057d0-ed4c-48ae-9447-9254b08b06a5
33,methods33," Both RCTs included in this review showed significant results; however, they examined the effect of a MD supplemented with Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) or nuts. Therefore, the protective association could be due to dietary confounders such as olive oil or nuts rather than the MD. Nuts and olive oil have a high content of anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory factors which aid in reducing the risk of cognitive decline [49,50]. Both RCTs only included participants at high risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Control groups in both RCT were following a low fat diet, maybe the inclusion of a subgroup that consumed the MD as is without any additional intake of olive oil or nuts would have better displayed the effect of the traditional MD on cognition. Nonetheless, these RCTs, given the study design they used and the long period of follow up, provide a base for future randomized trials show the efficacy of the MD on dementia.  5.",89261f29-8da5-441a-aaff-a8bf548aa422
34,methods34," Strengths and Limitations Our review is unique to the published literature as it investigated the potential differential effect of the MD on cognition in Mediterranean versus non-Mediterranean countries, based on geographical region and ethnicity of study participants. This is important when considering promotion of the adoption of the MD in non-Mediterranean countries to prevent cognitive decline, where adherence rates may differ. This may occur due to different levels of access to MD components or other factors that have not yet been investigated. Our review also considered the MD pattern holistically, rather than the association between specific macronutrient or micronutrient intakes and cognitive function. Other reviews utilize a different approach. Petersson et al. (2016) [73] included 31 articles that linked MD to cognition and AD. Results were reported by study design and did not include study region [73]. Panza et al.",2a0a934e-6b25-43bb-b00e-1f74a18750a8
35,methods35," (2004) did not explore the intake of the Mediterranean dietary pattern as a whole, but examined intakes of macronutrients (fat and protein) and MUFA and their effect on cognitive function [74]. Several other reviews and meta-analyses have investigated the effect of the MD on AD specifically [75,76]. All of these reviews concluded that the MD was associated with lower rates of cognitive decline, and lower risk of mild cognitive impairment, dementia and AD [76,77,78,79,80,81]. Results from a further 17 articles show that the MD may improve brain health and cognition by decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases [82]. Evidence is also reinforced by three meta-analyses that showed an association between the Mediterranean diet and cognitive function [77,83,84].  What differentiates this review is that it was not limited to a specific cognitive domain and included studies that used various cognitive tools.",564d45d5-2db7-46a5-a0b9-f1ba8f3136ee
36,methods36, The use of broad inclusion criteria aided in developing a more comprehensive and complete idea about the effect of the MD on cognitive decline. Databases were searched twice to ensure that all published articles in the literature have been examined for eligibility. The quality assessment method used in this review was developed by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and it is a detailed and accurate tool to assess the validity and relevance of articles read. Another strength is that we only included articles that scored neutral or positive on the quality assessment criteria and articles that scored a negative were excluded from this review. Reporting of results was completed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA)) guidelines; these guidelines are considered an ideal evidence-based method to report systematic reviews.,31413c16-5e50-4eb8-92bc-c01e56b40e3a
37,methods37,"  This review had some limitations that might have affected the reporting of our results. Dietary assessment methods varied from one study to the other, and this might have an effect on the outcomes and conclusions of the studies. For example, some studies used 24 h recalls others used food frequency questionnaires to assess long term dietary intake of the participants (Table 2). The 24 h-recall relies on a trained interviewer’s skills and ability to facilitate portion sizes as well as helping the participant in remembering what they consumed. However, this method is only considered accurate if it is done on various days to better represent usual intake and overcome day to day dietary variations. This method is subject to interviewer bias and reporting bias, nonetheless, an updated standardized version of the 24 h-recall, the multiple pass, aid in overcoming these biases by standardizing data collection [85].",ed71cc83-b976-4328-a47a-9f312c664d25
38,methods38," The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) can be completed by a trained interviewer or be self-administered. This method is also subject to interviewer bias and reporting bias; however, better results are guaranteed when conducted by a trained interviewer [85]. Another variation is that some studies included in this review conducted these dietary assessments via a face-to-face interview whereas others conducted the assessments via a phone call, yet both methods have been show to have small discrepancies among one another and are considered accurate [86]. Moreover, different scores are used to calculate adherence to the Mediterranean diet, Trichopoulou’s 0–9 MD score and Panagiotakos’s 0–55 MD score. As indicated in this review, both scores have been extensively used in the literature and are shown to be a reliable method of assessing adherence to the traditional MD [17,65].",32856ee6-4343-4a47-912a-862d6f95f297
39,methods39," Results from this review show that the MD scoring criteria used did not affect the association between MD and dementia. Another confounding factor could be the cognitive test used; for example, in the 31 articles included in this review, around 20 different cognitive tests were conducted to assess cognitive function or incidence of dementia.  6. Conclusions Dementia not only affects individuals and their families, but it also exerts immense social and economical impacts. The total cost of dementia in 2015 was 818 billion USD [87]. Most of the studies that examined the effectiveness of the MD on non-communicable diseases, specifically in the older adult population, showed significant results. MD was related to lower risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), metabolic syndrome, mortality and better mental health.",977a3d7b-447f-4d1f-8763-ca882503adcb
40,methods40," This effect is mainly due to the Mediterranean diet’s high content of B vitamins, folic acid and omega 3 fatty acids; all of which contribute an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative function [88]. The MD has been shown to be one of the most nutritionally adequate diets, and people with higher MD adherence scores have a better nutrient profile. Countries in Europe, residing near the Mediterranean Sea, have better nutrient intake qualities, specifically related to: zinc, iron, vitamins B12 and D, folic acid, calcium, selenium and iodine [89]. Most of the aforementioned single nutrients may play a role in improving cognitive function and lowering the risk of AD; however, more studies are needed to have conclusive results [90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97].  Given that there is no direct treatment for dementia, it is fundamental to invest in finding a way to delay its prognosis and reduce the risk of developing it.",08a8161c-9104-486f-a859-059962c29f52
41,methods41," The Mediterranean diet has been shown to aid in reducing this risk in a cost effective and sustainable manner [98]. The Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of cognitive decline by reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD)s, a known risk factor for dementia, and it also has an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effect [99]. The primary aim of this review was to summarize and analyze the literature based research examining the effect of the MD on cognitive function. Our results show that MD does not only play a protective role against cognitive decline, but it might also decrease the risk of developing AD. Various observational studies have shown the beneficial effect of the MD against dementia; however, more randomized controlled trials could aid in concluding long-term effects and strengthen the existing literature.",47a26f95-257c-45c8-b066-dcd50ced5f9b
42,methods42," Given the heterogeneity of cognitive tests and dietary outcome measures used, it is important to have a consensus on the diagnosis of cognitive function and the assessment of diet in order to overcome some discrepancies in the literature. Overcoming these gaps will aid in developing a promising, well-structured and comprehensive intervention that includes the MD as a beneficial tool against cognitive decline.
