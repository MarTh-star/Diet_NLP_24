0,introduction0,"Nutrition has a profound impact on health, both in the short-term and life-long scale. Nutrition affects the disease burden of both infectious and non-communicable disease outcomes. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study for 2017, dietary risk factors are accountable for as many as 11 million deaths and 255 million DALYs worldwide, with the biggest contribution from high sodium intake, low intake of whole grains and fruit [1].  Unhealthy diet is contributing to both poor (or insufficient) nourishment and environmental degradation, which points to the urgent need for a global transformation of the food system, ideally back towards traditional diets [2]. An example of such a diet is the Mediterranean diet (MD) [2, 3].",bd0d8142-0c63-4e70-b929-2de560ceedb8
1,introduction1," The MD is one of the most commonly investigated dietary patterns, with many beneficial effects for human health described so far [4], playing a role in prevention of cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD)) [5–7], cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk factors [8], diabetes [9, 10], cancer [11, 12], protection of mental health [13, 14], and better health-related quality of life [15].  According to the revised MD pyramid, the guidelines for adults include high daily intake of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and olive oil, moderate daily consumption of nuts, dairy products, and red wine, weekly intake of legumes, fish, eggs and poultry, and overall low intake of red and processed meat and other processed foods [16]. The MD is an incredibly rich nutritional pattern, with many varieties of dishes, flavors, textures, and nutrients, creating a complex “exposome”, which is the reason why it represents a challenge for defining and measuring [17].",2b953741-cc21-4d65-840b-272fd6259f6d
2,introduction2,"  In general, measuring nutrition and eating habits is far from being simple. There are several different approaches and all of them have their advantages and limitations. Dietary pattern can be defined using a general description, dietary pyramids, a priori scoring systems, a posteriori dietary pattern formation, or by quantifying food and nutrient content [18, 19]. A priori approach is more commonly applied and it uses a predefined scoring system, i.e. a diet index, in case of the MD an “attempt to make a global evaluation of the quality of the diet based on a traditional Mediterranean reference pattern” [20]. The indexes are usually based on data acquired within a 24 h quantitative intake recall, dietary records or food frequency questionnaires (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s) [21]. food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is one of the most commonly used approach for dietary assessment, usually showing good reproducibility and validity for MD assessment in heterogeneous samples [22].",0f8e440b-331d-44e8-89e1-cd7292d2194f
3,introduction3," Unfortunately, food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s include an exhaustive number of questions that take a long time to answer [23]. To overcome this issue, numerous short indexes have been developed to assess the adherence to the overall MD pattern. Because they are useful in rapidly evaluating a patient’s eating habits, such brief questionnaires are of special interest to researchers in the field of nutrition, as well as public health professionals and clinicians. Ideally, dietary questionnaires should not require much time to complete, should be easily and quickly evaluated, and interpretation of the result should not require elaborate knowledge on nutrition [24]. Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) [25], and the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S) are examples of such indexes [26].",13ddc98a-524e-46e8-82f7-980420ad6ada
4,introduction4,"  Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) emerged within the PREDIMED study (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea), one of the most comprehensive experimental studies in nutrition to date, aimed at investigating the long-term effects of the MD on incident cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in high risk individuals [27]. This questionnaire transcended its original use in the Spanish population, and has been used widely in various cultural and societal settings. Several validation studies showed that Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) is a valid and reliable questionnaire in different countries and languages [28–33].  Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S is another example of a simple and short scoring approach, and it incorporates 14 food groups in exact accordance with the new MD pyramid [16, 26], which is an important advantage of this index. According to the original study, Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S is a valid instrument [26].",78f52e33-4c89-43c8-a3f9-2bf539c0dd02
5,introduction5,"  Despite existence of many dietary indexes used in literature for assessing compliance with the MD, the evidence on their applicability and psychometric quality is scarce [34]. Due to the differences in the design of the studies, as well as the reliability and validity of the instruments, it is not possible to determine which questionnaire is the best.  Even though Croatia is one of the seven Mediterranean countries that participated in the process of inscription of the MD to the UNESCO’s representative list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity, no study has so far tested any dietary questionnaire regarding its validity. Only one previous study has assessed the reliability of the KIDMED questionnaire in a sample of students from the continental part of Croatia, and not from the Mediterranean region [35].",5f7fb879-6df0-4294-9480-c0fa5f3e6695
6,introduction6," This study aims to evaluate validity (accuracy) and test-retest reliability of the Croatian version of the short, 14-item Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S) questionnaire, compared to the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)), based on a sample of students from the University of Split, Croatia. ",e58ebf06-4dff-4b28-9e53-d8f0d0984c62
7,methods0,"Study design and subjects This cross-sectional study was carried out in Split, Croatia, the largest city on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. We included two independent samples in order to assess psychometric properties of the Croatian version of a short MD questionnaire. The initial, exploratory sample of medical students from the University of Split School of Medicine was used for reliability testing (test-retest repeatability) and concurrent and construct validity of the Croatian version of the short Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire. A total of 377 medical students enrolled in the first, third and fifth study year (out of six study years) were sampled during the period of December 2018—October 2019, with the overall response rate of 80.2%. The second confirmatory sample was used to replicate results and confirm the initial Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire validity results and to investigate its’ predictive validity.",c6d62321-1dfa-4b2b-bef4-c5c626934b30
8,methods1," This independent confirmatory sample consisted of 320 students from the University Department of Health Studies (nurses, lab technicians, radiology technicians, physiotherapists; response rate 81.2%) sampled during the period of May—December 2019. Inclusion criteria were age over 18 years, both genders, and the willingness to provide informed consent. There were no exclusion criteria.  Procedures The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire was selected as the reference (gold standard) to validate the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire in Croatian language, due to its broad use in the literature and previous results in several validation studies [28–33]. The first step was to translate both the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaires into Croatian, using the originally proposed and validated instruments [23, 26].",fc1b9029-270b-434b-a499-22815cbad006
9,methods2," This was done according to the guidelines from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR, Fig 1) [36].  10.1371/journal.pone.0247269.g001Fig 1 Flow diagram of translation method, according to the guidelines of ISPOR [36]. The same translation procedure was used for both the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S) questionnaire [26] and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) questionnaire [23].  In short, an independent, proficient English speaker did a back-translation (from Croatian to English), followed by a second back translation (from English to Croatian). A certified English translator compared the original and back-translated versions of the English questionnaire, while a professor of the Croatian language compared two translated Croatian versions. All discrepancies were resolved, and Croatian versions of both questionnaires were harmonized.",0922d608-31cf-4412-b5fb-42ab375404df
10,methods3," Finally, we performed a pilot study including 51 students from the University Department of Health Studies to test applicability of the questionnaires. Namely, we aimed to obtain information about respondent and administrative burden, and to assess the cultural acceptability and language applicability [34], these responses were not used for validity or reliability analysis. There were no major objections by the involved students, and the questionnaires were finalized accordingly. Detailed flow chart of the study is presented in Fig 2.  10.1371/journal.pone.0247269.g002Fig 2 Flow diagram of the validation study. All stages of data collection are depicted, along with the sample size included in each stage and the final analysis of the data.  The students were invited to participate in the study during their mandatory courses, in order to ensure the highest possible response rate.",123f6a9e-6046-4467-ad43-69ae1824c616
11,methods4," After the initial explanation of the purpose and procedures of the study, students who decided to participate were asked to provide informed consent. Medical students filled out the questionnaire twice, whereas health studies (nursing) students just once, the latter group filled out a more detailed survey. Since students answered the questionnaire anonymously, they were asked to provide a unique code using letters and numbers related to their identity (the first letter of their parent’s name, the first letter of the place they were born, and two starting digits of their birthday date). This code was needed to pair the data obtained during the first and second time point (test and retest), simultaneously avoiding unnecessary memorization of the codes [37]. The retest was carried out between one and two weeks after the first round of data collection (Fig 2), which is acceptable for evaluating test-retest reliability [38].",dcca478d-0a16-444a-98a9-f41e004c9c45
12,methods5," All of the data were collected using a paper-based, self-administered approach, and the average time needed to complete the survey was 10 minutes for medical students and 15 minutes for health studies students. During this time, a facilitator was present (at least one of the authors of this study during each surveying sessions), ready to assist with any questions regarding the survey posed by respondents.  Questionnaire Subjects in the exploratory sample completed an anonymous self-administered questionnaire consisting of general questions (gender, age, study program, and the year of study) and two short MD questionnaires.  The confirmatory sample of subjects was additionally asked about other characteristics and habits needed for predictive validity assessment, such as body weight, body height, how long ago they had weighed themselves (in days), and smoking habits (active smokers, ex-smokers, non-smokers).",6ea75d43-a8d3-46a9-94a5-72ba9e6f0801
13,methods6," Using body weight and height, we calculated the body mass index using the standard formula:  BMI=weight(kg)height(m2)   Additionally, health studies students answered questions on eating habits, including the number of meals per day (both main meals and snacks, separately for working days and weekend days), how often they usually eat breakfast (days per week), and whether they cook (possible answers were “yes, frequently”, “sometimes” or “no”). We also asked whether they have ever been on a weight loss diet (“yes” or “no”), whether they are satisfied with their body appearance (“yes”, “no” or “I don’t think about it”), and whether they are snacking while watching TV (possible answers “yes, frequently”, “yes, sometimes” or “no”). Questions on physical activity included practicing any sports (“yes, weekly”, “rarely” or “never”) and going to the gym (“yes, weekly”, “rarely” or “never”).",4e9edf66-aadd-46e6-a7ea-052286cb45ac
14,methods7," Finally, we asked students to rate their self-perceived health and quality of life using a Likert scale, where 0 represented a very poor health or quality of life, and 10 represented full health or quality of life.  Additionally, we used the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well being Scale (WEMWBS)), a validated questionnaire used for measuring mental well-being, especially focusing on the positive aspects of mental health [39]. This questionnaire was translated to Croatian using the same ISPOR procedure [36], and it was applied in both exploratory and confirmatory sample. The purpose of Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well being Scale (WEMWBS) questionnaire was to serve as a non-dietary reliability comparator and as an outcome in the predictive validity analysis in order to investigate the association between the MD and well-being in students.  MD assessment instruments We used two short MD questionnaires in this study.",5e299715-1279-4d1d-8f78-1e52c96804b4
15,methods8," The Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire [26] was being validated and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire [23] was selected as the gold standard, due to its extensive previous use in the literature.  The Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S) is an MD index that was originally validated against the Mediterranean Dietary Score (Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)), proposed by Trichopoulou et al. [40]. In the validation study on 1,155 women aged 12–83 years from Spain, both Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S and Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS) indexes were based on the data obtained from the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [26].",f80a30bb-8380-4c51-8111-ca97056fd2e4
16,methods9," It was found that Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S index was “an updated, easy, valid, and accurate instrument to assess MD adherence based on the consumption of foods and food groups per meal, day, and week” [26], while being in accordance with the latest update of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid [16, 26]. Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S index incorporates 14 typical MD food groups, and individuals whose intake is within the recommended range receive either 3, 2, or 1 points for each of the specific food groups consumption per meal, daily or weekly, while those individuals who don’t reach the particular goal get 0 points (Table 1).  10.1371/journal.pone.0247269.t001Table 1 Comparison of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaires and the scoring procedure (each row represents one question that contributes to the overall score).",8101dd77-0bea-4c10-9fe1-73a01e640a5d

19,methods12,"5 refers to adherence	 b) Binary: ≥8 denotes adherence	 Therefore, the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S index can range between 0 and 24 points for adults and between 0 and 23 for adolescents, since alcoholic beverages intake is not considered appropriate in this age group [26]. Out of the maximum 24 points, 12 points (50%) can be obtained for recommended intake of fruits, vegetables, cereals, and olive oil (3 points each, for consumption during every main meal). Additional 4 points can be obtained for daily intake of dairy products and nuts (2 points each), and 8 points for weekly intake of legumes, potatoes, eggs, fish, white meat, red meat and sweets (Table 1). According to the original study, people with a score of ≥13.5 on the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S scale can be considered as adherent to the principles of the MD, which we rounded up to 14 points (Table 1) [26].",24087efe-8f67-412a-bb2e-f14c1c08ba15
20,methods13," The same Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S scoring system was used in our previous study in the general population of Dalmatia, but the data were obtained through the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) [41]. We did not use the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in this study due to the more extensive burden of this approach to the subjects. Instead, we have used only 14 questions including food groups that comprise the original Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S index (S1 Table), with the exception that we didn’t include beer in the fermented beverages, as originally proposed [26]. Instead, we only included wine, which is in accordance with the modern MD pyramid [16]. Additionally, the question on juices and sugar-sweetened beverages was introduced as a separate item, but it was scored within sweets, as proposed [26]. The full questionnaire is presented in both Croatian and English in S1 Table.",dd983ee4-ceaa-474e-912a-6e39802ed174
21,methods14,"  Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) was chosen as a gold standard needed to assess the validity of the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S index. Since Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) was not previously validated for application in Croatian language, we used the same steps for questionnaire preparation as for the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire, and we also performed Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) test-retest reliability assessment.  The original version of Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) was designed and validated in Spain [23, 25]. It was translated into several languages and validated for use in Germany [28], Iran [29], UK [30], Turkey [31], Korea [32] and Portugal [33].",f650cff3-e595-4cad-a2c5-88a2728ee6ee
22,methods15," The original version of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire contains 14 items (S1 Table), with 12 questions about the frequency of food consumption, and two items are about the eating habits characteristic for the Spanish area [23]. Each item is scored with either a 0 or 1, with the overall score ranging between 0 and 14 (Table 1). There are two ways to categorize the overall Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score. Subjects can be divided into 3 subgroups, where the score of ≤5 points indicates low adherence, 6–9 indicates moderate adherence and ≥10 points indicates high level of adherence to the principles of the MD (Table 1) [23, 25]. Additionally, a cut-off score of ≥8 points has been used to denote adherence to the principles of the MD, while Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score of ≤7 points represents MD non-adherence [23].",2be5b5ad-7b86-4f21-90e6-22c6673c3f4d
23,methods16," Croatian version of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire is presented in S1 Table.  There are some differences between Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaires. For example, some food groups are included in Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S and not in Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), such as cereals, dairy products, eggs, and potatoes. Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S separates fruit juices from fresh fruit consumption and it does not include processed meat, unlike Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). On the other hand, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) incorporates sofrito sauce, butter or margarine or cream and sweetened beverage intake as separate groups, whereas all types of juices are regarded as sweets according to the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire scoring [26].",fe294db5-a7e9-4132-826d-6d93cf2ea628
24,methods17," Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) distinguishes between cooked and raw vegetables and includes two questions on olive oil, which is not the case in Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S index. Furthermore, there is a difference in proposed frequency of consumption for nuts, legumes, fish and red meat. Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire aims to incorporate higher intake of traditional Mediterranean staples, such as vegetables, fruits, olive oil and fish, but it also takes into account some of the non-traditional, Western type of foods, such as already mentioned margarine or cream, processed meat and sweetened beverages, demanding their lower intake. On the other hand, Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire asks only about consumption of the traditional MD foods, entirely in accordance to the recommendations of the modern MD pyramid [16, 26].",100316a3-6e87-4f10-939d-5a704b9d7f50
25,methods18," Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S is also giving more weight to the foods at the base of the MD pyramid and more points are awarded for higher intake of vegetables, fruit, cereals and olive oil, unlike in the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) index. All of these differences between Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) are presented in Table 1. ",52104ea4-b126-4e7e-a665-40d06cd485cf

Numerical variables were mostly non-normally distributed (tested by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test), and they were presented as medians and interquartile ranges (interquartile ranges (IQR)). Differences between groups were tested using chi-square test for categorical variables, and Mann–Whitney U test for numerical variables. Spearman rank test was used to test bivariate correlation between numerical variables.  Test-retest reliability was tested using intra-class correlation coefficients (intra class correlation coefficients (ICC); two-way mixed model) and Spearman rank test for both Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) overall scores.

Additionally, test-retest agreement was calculated using kappa statistic for all of the separate food groups [43].  Concurrent validity of Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S index was also tested using intra class correlation coefficients (ICC), Spearman rank test and Cohen’s kappa statistic, against Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) index, both for the first testing time, and for the retest.",5020c4c4-cf35-4a04-88ea-4816d497d51b
28,analysis2," Despite methodological limitations, Spearman’s rank test was calculated to provide comparison with previous studies.  We also applied the Principal Component Analysis (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) to both MD questionnaires to test construct validity and to identify food groups (factors), using Varimax rotation and the cut-off of >0.30 for absolute factor loadings to suppress small coefficients. The suitability of the data for factor analysis was tested by the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (≥0.60) and Bartlett’s test of sphericity (P<0.05). Factors with an Eigenvalue ≥1.0 were retained, and total explained variance was recorded.  Due to missing data from the MD questionnaires, we excluded 17 medical students from the initial, exploratory sample (see Fig 2).",08606bd3-97d1-4c31-88a8-694cdb93bb45
29,analysis3," This resulted in a sample size of 360 students at the first time point, included in concurrent validity analysis, while 210 of these students were available during the second time point (retest), and they were included in the test-retest reliability analysis. This was an appropriate sample size, based on the estimate of an ideal subject to questionnaire item ratio being between 10:1 and 20:1 [44].  All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The level of significance was set at P<0.05.

The agreement was moderate during both first testing session (intra class correlation coefficients (ICC) = 0.544, 95% CI 0.439–0.629, P<0.001), and the second testing session (intra class correlation coefficients (ICC) = 0.533, 95% CI 0.387–0.644; P<0.001) (Table 3).  As a comparator for reliability analysis, students’ responses on the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well being Scale (WEMWBS)) were used. The correlation coefficient between the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well being Scale (WEMWBS) test and retest score was 0.800 (P<0.",eac9bf5a-450f-4d1b-ac86-7d0b6be3548c

No differences were found for snacking habits during TV watching and for body appearance satisfaction for either of the MD index. On the other hand, there was a difference in sports and gym-using habits, where subjects adherent to MD according to Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) index were more frequently physically active compared to non-adherent subjects (Table 7).",bcc88c70-b440-40bc-8911-e82183d7025e

Validity of the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S index, compared to the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) index as a referent point, was also better when expressed as a total score than adherence. These results were replicated in our confirmatory sample, verifying our findings that the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire is a reasonably valid instrument for the MD assessment in Croatia.  Differing results obtained for the overall numerical scores and for the binary adherence are in line with previous papers, which suggested that dichotomizing a continuous variable is not the optimal way of handling the data [45, 46]. Indeed, we have shown here that the use of a continuous variable provides much better estimates and should be favored as opposed to categorization.",7c1d27cb-cf57-4712-aab0-92a570d3692c
44,discussion1,"  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S with the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire for validation purposes. We have chosen the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire as a referent point due to several reasons. Firstly, it includes similar questions and food groups and employs a similar scoring approach to the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire. Furthermore, it was already shown to be valid in several languages [28–33], and it is quite frequently used in the literature. However, there are some differences between those two indexes. These differences have affected our results, yielding lower agreements and validity estimates within specific food groups.",89ad7a89-f6d8-4ff6-8c32-4fc526faf9d6
45,discussion2," For example, based on the comparison of Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire items with Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) items, only sweets, red meat and wine had moderate or better agreement, legumes and fish had fair agreement, while the remaining five food groups had none to only slight agreement. In light of previously mentioned differences between Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire, this was not a surprising finding. However, factor analysis revealed that both questionnaires explained similar proportion of the total variance of the MD pattern, 59.3% for Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and 60.2% for Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire. Furthermore, identified factors and their corresponding loading values showed remarkable overlap between the two indexes. This confirms that both questionnaires are assessing the universal Mediterranean dietary pattern.",5267ab7b-6785-4401-9d8c-708c97f4b4f5
46,discussion3,"  Given that we used the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire as a referent point, we had to prepare this questionnaire to be used in Croatian language, and we used the same procedures as we did for the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire. Additionally, we tested the performance of Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire regarding its reliability. Our results showed that Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire displayed a close to excellent repeatability in the test-retest procedure, with intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.887, which was very similar to the result obtained for Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S. This high reliability can be compared to the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) validation study carried out in the UK, where two administrations of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) produced similar mean total scores and an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.",aa2234c4-a920-4bee-b397-35ed14e49a18

Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire showed higher test-retest agreement for vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, fish, and sweets than the same items in the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire, while a slightly lower agreement was recorded only for wine and olive oil and a notably lesser agreement for white meat.

48,discussion5,"  Brief dietary questionnaires are useful and commonly used for identifying the overall eating patterns as well as for highlighting problems with patient’s eating habits easily and quickly. Unfortunately, there are so many dietary questionnaires in use, particularly those for assessing the MD pattern. For example, a recent study identified as many as 28 different indexes being used in the literature, but only a very few scores fulfilled the applicability parameters and psychometric quality, while the overall level of evidence was scarce [34]. Other reviews have also found similar abundance of indexes used in the literature, and performed comparison of performance of several commonly used dietary indexes and questionnaires [8, 20, 47–52]. These studies have shown that there is no such thing as one ideal instrument, which would objectively measure the adherence to the MD [50].",2607b03a-b1e8-42f1-b6ad-4455aec0d475
49,discussion6," This represents a certain barrier in both research and practical domains, disabling direct comparisons between studies and across populations, as well as contributing to the lack of indisputable evidence of MD benefits, which could be used for MD endorsement on the larger population scale. For, example, a recent Cochrane systematic review on the MD use for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases pointed out the variety of MD definitions, low to moderate quality of evidence and only modest benefits of the MD [53].  In previous validation studies, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire tended to yield a higher MD adherence than the control questionnaires [25, 28, 30]. This was also the case in our study. Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) showed a slightly higher rate of MD adherence compared to the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S in both of our samples, but overall it was still quite low.",baf7635b-5760-41e3-9850-38167f4f5ee9
50,discussion7," According to the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire, 19.7% of medical students were compliant with the MD, and as few as 13.6% according to the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire. In the confirmatory sample of health studies students we recorded 14.7% of MD adherent students based on the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire and 9.4% based on Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S index. This is lower than our expectations, especially when we take into account that our samples consisted of the future healthcare professionals, who are expected to be educated in the matters of disease prevention and to have the prominent role in terms of care and education of patients about healthy lifestyle and health protection. Despite their biomedical educational background, these young people reported similar, low prevalence of MD adherence just as the general young population of Dalmatia [41].",b23d1c29-7dcf-48f2-94d0-1417d369f91a
51,discussion8," Unfortunately, our results are not an isolate finding [54]. The same pattern of decay of MD lifestyle and diet, being replaced by the Western lifestyle, was found among university students in other countries [55–63]. A recent study found that students who live away from their parents and those from Mediterranean countries deviate from MD towards more unhealthy diet, while future healthcare professionals were neither familiar with the Mediterranean diet nor were following the principles of the MD [64]. On the other hand, the same study found that lower MD adherence in students was associated with poorer health status, while higher MD adherence was associated with lower depression risk and better sleep quality [64]. Our results have confirmed these findings, since we found that students with higher Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S score had better self-assessed health perception and mental well-being.",777925ea-eb18-4c45-bd9e-02430910273a
52,discussion9," These findings alone could and should be used in health education and MD promotion in student population, which is clearly needed.  One of the limitations of this study is a cross-sectional design for the part of the study investigating predictive validity of the MD questionnaire. Furthermore, data collection was carried out in such a way that subjects were required to recall their eating habits, which could have resulted in the recall bias. Most importantly, we did not use face to face interviews like previous validation studies did [25, 33], but instead we used a self-administered questionnaire. We believed that our anonymous and self-administering approach would enhance the response rate and facilitate honest responses from students, while not substantially diminishing credibility and reliability of the data (a facilitator was always present and students could inquire about any uncertainties).",9cfff490-6faf-46c3-9965-1527495ffcbb
53,discussion10,"  It is also important to note that our sample included a younger population comprised exclusively of students, who are mostly healthy, while previous validation studies were largely carried out on a sample of older adults at risk for various chronic diseases [25, 28, 30].  The strengths of the study include a strict methodological framework, two relatively large and independent samples with high response rate (≥80%) from Dalmatia county, which were assumed to have more uniform and traditional eating habits. This is the first study to compare the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S with Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire for validation purposes and the first validation study of the Croatian version of the short MD questionnaire for adult population.",8a52bca7-9a6d-4b08-b864-3ca8a4a867e2
54,discussion11," The recommendations state that the questionnaires should be linguistically adapted to the country in which they are used in order to ensure reliability and acceptable level of validity of the obtained results [24, 34]. Furthermore, the rationale for adapting different instruments to measure MD adherence in different populations and the comparison of how and why these instruments perform differently are interesting and important questions to explore and warrant further studies. This study described performance of two short MD screeners and it answers to an unmet need of Croatian scientists and clinicians, providing a valid and easy to use instrument for assessing MD adherence. The Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire could be used as a screening tool in the general population for public health surveillance, in clinical settings, and in scientific studies.",f4a2735f-31d7-40a7-b71e-ec4c2879ff50
55,discussion12,"  Conclusions We demonstrated that a short version of the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire is highly reliable and a reasonably valid instrument for the assessment of the adherence to the overall Mediterranean dietary pattern in Croatia. The best performance of Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S was obtained when used as a numeric score, even in the population with low MD adherence. Despite above-mentioned limitations, the Croatian version of the short 14-items Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire can be used for a rapid assessment of adherence to the MD in Croatia, possibly both in research and in clinical practice.

We have carefully considered many possible options and methodological approaches during study design phase, and unfortunately, none of them was a perfect solution. Given that our target population included students, we could not have encumbered them with too long and demanding questionnaires because we would not have reached large enough response rate and sample size.

Several validation studies showed that Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) is a valid and reliable questionnaire in different countries and languages [33-38].“ (lines 105-107).

According to Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) criterion, we recorded 17% of men and 24% of women who reported taking at least 4 TBSP of olive oil per day, while according to Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S criterion we showed that 15% of men and 21% of women were adherent, i.e. taking olive oil several times a day.",8e6422af-aa71-444d-80e6-5b4c926a2b0c

Based on the result of the factor analysis, both questionnaires explained similar proportion of the total variance of the MD pattern (59.3% for Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and 60.2% for Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire), and both questionnaires yielded the same factors with similar corresponding loading values. This indicates a remarkable overlap between the two indexes and we can conclude that they are in essence not so different.

Even though you are completely right when stating that Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S “might be a better candidate for a generalizable screener” for MD, and we agree with this entirely, we still needed a comparison with gold standard to be able to assess the performance of Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S. And even though we got ‘less than perfect’ results in concurrent validity analysis, we consider this as a lesser issue in general, especially when compared to the possibility of the overestimation of validity (hypothetical).",80920ad6-1c67-411c-b6a1-f5092c466ac1

The Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S investigate the consumption of dairy product without distinguish low from medium/high content of fat (i.e. yogurt from cheese). This could results in a leak of goodness in assessing adherence to MD.",29d8eb9f-17a6-44ed-9ac5-f65bdaa78c8c
91,discussion48," Did the authors consider these occurrence in choosing MDDS? Should they explain how they can assert the adherence to MD without accounting for this distinction?  Answer: Thank you for this comment, we do agree with your premise about the need for distinguishing low from medium/high content of fat in dairy products. However, the questionnaire that was used in a study by authors Panagiotakos DB et al., asks subjects about “full fat dairy products”, while Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S asks about “Milk and dairy products”, including milk, yoghurt, cheese, and even ice-cream. This is due to the fact that the modern MD pyramid, which was the basis for Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S score development is putting more emphasis on low fat dairy products (Figure 2 in paper by Bach-Faig A, Berry EM, Lairon D, Reguant J, Trichopoulou A, Dernini S, et al.

92,discussion49,"1017/S1368980011002515). While you may in fact have the point in advantageous use of full fat dairy, which is based on ‘Traditional Mediterranean diet pyramid, and as mentioned and incorporated into the Mediterranean diet score proposed by Panagiotakos DB et al, we could not change the original Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S index too much (we only excluded beer consumption), and we decided to keep it as similar to the originally proposed scoring system and the underlying MD pyramid.  Furthermore, there are some differences in food consumption between Croatia and Greece. Greeks mostly use medium/high-fat dairy products daily i.e. feta cheese, while for Croatian people this is not so typical. In conclusion, we kept the scoring system within the originally proposed frame and we hope this can be acceptable, given that this is in line with the MD pyramid (Bach-Faig A, et al. doi: https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980011002515).   3. Similar to the above. Still referring to D.B.",72b057fb-72c4-40ea-bff5-4c0201c29045
93,discussion50," Panagiotakos, the MDDS des not distinguish whole from refined grains. Also if refined grains are largely consumed among population, whole grains use is the reference for the adherence to MD. Should the authors have chosen another questionnaire for their validation paper?  Answer: Yes, Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire asks about consumption of ‘Cereals, all types (bread, breakfast cereals, pasta and rice)’. Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S index does not distinguish between whole grain and non-whole grain cereals, probably due to the fact that MD pyramid recommends whole grains, but does not demand them (Bach-Faig A et al). Based on this, we didn’t ask our subjects about consumption of cereals separately in this study.   Even though this is an important matter, we have still decided to use Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S index as the one that would be applicable in our population. There are several reasons for that.",2b3bddae-6244-4138-86b2-e0877fae7e53
94,discussion51," The first one is that it is in line with the modern MD pyramid (Bach-Faig A et al). The second reason is that it covers the main components of the MD, some of which are not even included in Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire (for example cereals, dairy, eggs and potatoes). Thirdly, Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S puts greater emphasis on the most important food groups, those that form the basis of MD pyramid, and which should be included daily (more points are awarded to those food groups). Finally, it is short and very easy to apply and score (for both respondents and for those who apply it), making it quick and practical, while providing a general overview of the MD pattern. Hence, it could be used as a screening tool in the general population for public health surveillance, in clinical settings with patients, and in scientific studies.  4.",92e87ab9-8b49-4c87-8a6e-0df702ee1dd1
95,discussion52," The authors tested the reliability of Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S performing the test-retest procedure, but they didn’t assess the internal consistency of the MDDS (i.e. estimated with Cronbach’s alpha). Could the author provide this part in the methodology section?  Answer: This is a fair point, given that most of the papers dealing with questionnaires report this parameter. There are several reasons why we didn’t initially perform this analysis. Firstly, and of minor significance, Cronbach’s alpha was not reported in the original paper describing and validating Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire (Monteagudo C, Mariscal-Arcas M, Rivas A, Lorenzo-Tovar ML, Tur JA, Olea-Serrano F. Proposal of a Mediterranean Diet Serving Score. PLoS ONE. 2015;10(6):e0128594.).",47277918-5cf3-4dcf-bc2f-54f87b6aafc6
96,discussion53," Secondly, both Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaires are comprised of 14 questions/food groups, and all of these questions are recoded into binary variables (adherent /not adherent to a particular food group intake), which would demand another kind of test for internal consistency (Kuder-Richardson 20 test), while Cronbach’s alpha is more appropriate for Likert scales or ordinal variables. Finally, and most importantly, we have revealed six factors underlying the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire in our sample (Table 6), and we got the same result for Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire. Thus, performing Cronbach’s alpha analysis in our study would break the first premise of the Cronbach’s alpha parameter, which is the unidimensionality of the instrument.",f7d8be81-a2a9-4b2d-acd4-7ec8be97bfe2
97,discussion54," In a paper by Taber KS on the use of Cronbach’s alpha it was stated that “the scale needs to be unidimensional to provide an “interpretable” result, as a score obtained from a measuring scale ought to indicate the “amount” of the construct being measured” (Taber KS. The Use of Cronbach’s Alpha When Developing and Reporting Research Instruments in Science Education. Res Sci Educ. 2018;48;1273–1296. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11165-016-9602-2). Furthermore, in that paper the author concludes: “Cronbach’s alpha is most valuable for indicating scale reliability in the sense of the equivalence of items within single-construct scales, but the statistic does not offer any indication that scales are actually unidimensional (which should be tested by other means).” (Taber KS).",fde0a28b-68b5-4fa5-9f94-605672768fe0
98,discussion55,"   However, we have performed this analysis, merely as an experiment and out of curiosity and we did get a result that is supporting our finding that the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S instrument applied in our sample was indeed multi-dimensional, since we got the Cronbach's alpha values of 0.249 for Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S questionnaire, and it was 0.403 for Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire. This is indeed in line with the statement from a recent paper by McNeish D: “In many circumstances, violating these (unrealistic) assumptions yields estimates of reliability that are too small, making measures look less reliable than they actually are.” (McNeish D. Thanks coefficient alpha, we'll take it from here. Psychol Methods. 2018;23:412-433. doi: 10.1037/met0000144.). Additionally, Sijtsma K.",e71df1f7-554d-4637-a78c-78b379fd5926
99,discussion56," also stated that “probably no other statistic has been reported more often as a quality indicator of test scores than Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, and presumably no other statistic has been subject to so much misunderstanding and confusion (Sijtsma K. On the Use, the Misuse, and the Very Limited Usefulness of Cronbach's Alpha. Psychometrika. 2009;74(1):107-120. doi:10.1007/s11336-008-9101-0). There are some studies, which conclude that Cronbach’s alpha is commonly used erroneously (Gardner PL. Measuring attitudes to science: unidimensionality and internal consistency revisited. Research in Science Education. 1995;25:283–289. doi:10.1007/bf02357402.), and sometimes it is abused and contributes to the confusion in the literature (Sijtsma K.; doi:10.1007/s11336-008-9101-0), and we would like to avoid contributing to this situation further by reporting Cronbach’s alpha. These are the reasons why we would like to ask to be exempted from reporting Cronbach’s alpha in our study.",b38353a3-54ca-4211-9b37-f452c0a1e2ba
100,discussion57," Furthermore, instead of Cronbach’s alpha we reported three types of questionnaire reliability and validity parameters: 1. test-retest reliability (both intra-class correlation coefficients and Cohen’s kappa values were calculated), 2. concurrent validity, and 3. predictive validity. Proving the unidimensionality of the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS)S or Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) index was not our aim and we consider this less relevant for the purpose of our study.  5. Could the author, also, provide the psychometric properties of the items? (inter-item association)  Answer: This question is the continuation of the previous one, and hence the answer we provided in the previous sections is also applicable here.",3eef4734-7bf1-4e8a-9d38-bc19ec9405fd
