0,introduction0,"The process of population ageing that is occurring in developed societies represents a major challenge for the health system. Cardiovascular diseases (Cardiovascular diseases (CVD)) are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, representing half of the deaths in persons aged over 65 years and affecting >70% of patients with diabetes mellitus. The non-modifiable cause of vascular ageing in healthy adults is age, because it causes increased arterial stiffness and changes in chromosome replication with telomere shortening.1 2  The comparison of biological age with chronological age allows us to establish if the pattern of vascular ageing is at an expected or accelerated rate, that is, if early vascular ageing (early vascular ageing (EVA)) is present or not.1 2  Arterial stiffness and ageing: Arterial stiffness increases with age even in healthy adults.",ca8c1e66-48c0-476d-8b62-1d8c8d4baa8d
1,introduction1,"3 It involves changes in vascular structure with thickening of the arterial wall, changes in vascular function due to increased stiffness, and decreased wall distensibility of large arteries, associated with endothelial dysfunction and pulse wave changes.3 4 These changes are primarily mediated by nitric oxide.1 Arterial ageing is a multifactorial process associated with changes in structure and function of the large arteries.1 These changes are related to age, and are accelerated in the presence of associated Cardiovascular diseases (CVD),5–9 cardiovascular risk factors or cardio-unhealthy lifestyles.10 Some of these factors are controllable, and a greater understanding of the links existing between vascular ageing, lifestyle and Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) will help find strategies geared to preventing or delaying this ageing.",0c06a7df-8b90-41be-9169-35483d2f92e0
2,introduction2,"11 12  Telomere length and vascular ageing: Somatic ageing starts when telomerase activity decreases and prevents accurate copies of chromosome replication being made in the distal end, resulting in a decreased telomere length.13 Although telomerase activity is genetically determined, it is also sensitive to the action of external factors.1 In addition to ageing, inflammation and oxidative stress are endogenous factors causing telomere shortening.14 Telomere length is also correlated with lifestyle.14 A reduced activity genotype causes a greater degree of vulnerability to triggering factors such as sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, stress and smoking.13 The intimate relationship between the action of telomerase and morbidity and mortality has been documented in different studies.",d918a7df-b123-44e5-b254-2427698db0ed
3,introduction3,"13 Rode et al15 analysed 64 637 individuals from the general population and concluded that short telomeres in peripheral blood leucocytes were associated with high mortality for individuals in the short test versus the longest decile. In 1525 postmenopausal women with a follow-up of 13 years, Carty et al16 found that white women with a shorter leucocyte telomere length (leucocyte telomere length (LTL)) had higher risks of mortality and coronary heart disease. In contrast, shorter leucocyte telomere length (LTL) was weakly associated with decreased mortality hazard in African-American women. Simpson et al,17 in patients with cancer, concluded that the fusogenic telomere length threshold provides a powerful, independent prognostic marker with clinical utility in breast cancer.",3ed21e51-b2bd-45d3-a20f-9b58f574818f
4,introduction4," Additionally, Needham et al18 examined the association between leucocyte telomere length (LTL) and mortality in 3091 US adults aged 50–84 years, and concluded that the association between leucocyte telomere length (LTL) and mortality differs by race/ethnicity and cause of death; the review performed by Haycock et al19 concluded that the available observational data show an inverse association between leucocyte telomere length (LTL) and risk of coronary heart disease, independent of conventional vascular risk factors. The association with cerebrovascular disease is less certain. We have not found any study analysing the relationship of telomere length with the different factors involved in ageing in the Spanish population.  Physical activity and vascular ageing: There is ample evidence of the beneficial effect of exercise on vascular ageing.",fa4abb49-6b61-44ee-9e2c-ac621b27de9b
5,introduction5,"20 Regular aerobic physical activity of moderate intensity has been shown in adults to be associated with lower arterial stiffness and lower carotid intima-media thickness (intima media thickness (IMT)).21 22 In contrast, in sedentary healthy adults, ageing is associated with increased stiffness of the large elastic arteries and with poorer vascular endothelial function and increased mortality.22 23 The EVIDENT study found an association of physical activity with better vascular structure and function and sedentary time (hours spent watching television) with greater arterial stiffness.24 However, there are some points that are still unresolved such as the effect of endurance exercises, alone or combined with aerobic exercises, on vascular ageing.22 In addition, physical activity improves endothelial function, increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide and reduces the presence of oxidative stress and inflammatory agents, such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).",0833a3a7-2034-476e-8803-4c4025b0dab1
6,introduction6,"25 Therefore, physical activity favourably modulates several expressions of vascular ageing, thereby preserving vascular function and possibly reducing Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk.1 20 26  Diet and vascular ageing: The Mediterranean diet is currently considered the epitome of a healthy diet. There is evidence that it improves vascular ageing27 28 and endothelial function,29 30 increasing the number of endothelial cells and reducing vascular inflammation, oxidative stress and postprandial oxidative stress markers.29 30 An omega-3 rich diet improves vascular ageing27 28 and a caloric-restricted diet improves vascular structure and function.31 The PREDIMED study (Prevention with a Mediterranean Diet) has shown that participants in the intervention groups (Mediterranean diet) could reduce the incidence of major cardiovascular complications by 30% at 4 years of follow-up.",cabdbfa2-a5f6-40c0-8523-9b6781356002

However, the association of psychological factors (depression, anxiety disorder and stress) with vascular stiffness and therefore with early vascular ageing (EVA) is not well established.",5f4812d9-7252-45b8-b2b1-1a44998c20e3
8,introduction8,"  Smoking and vascular ageing: Cigarette smoke stimulates leucocyte release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, increases the adherence of monocytes to the endothelium, and elicits airway inflammation. Smoking promotes endothelial dysfunction, decreasing nitric oxide and increasing oxidative stress.5 41 Tobacco smoking enhances telomere shortening in circulating human white cell counts (WCCs). Telomere attrition (expressed in WCCs) can serve as a biomarker of the cumulative oxidative stress and inflammation induced by smoking and, consequently, show the pace of biological ageing.42–44  Alcohol and vascular ageing: In some studies, a beneficial effect of low or moderate alcohol consumption was found, particularly when taken as red wine.9 There are several studies that analysed the influence of alcohol in vascular stiffness and vascular ageing, concluding that moderate alcohol consumption may be beneficial.",57fcb7a8-b775-4c69-b284-f4d02aa2842b
9,introduction9,"45–47  Inflammatory markers and oxidative stress: Decreased arterial endothelial function with age is an independent risk factor for the development of vascular disease in healthy adults.1 Similarly, microvascular dysfunction and vascular hyperpermeability, which alter the integrity of the endothelium and its barrier function, are promoted by oxidative stress, decreased nitric oxide, and proinflammatory changes and increased arterial stiffness.3 4 48–51  MicroRNAs (miRNA) have a critical role in the development of atherosclerotic disease, taking part in each step from the start of plaque formation to plaque destabilisation and rupture. Their analysis will help determine the pathophysiological mechanisms of arterial ageing.52–56  Assessment of early vascular ageing (EVA): Arterial stiffness can be assessed with different clinical tools.",9cb61d08-4967-4356-a367-9f0b0867c082
10,introduction10," The currently accepted gold standard to assess arterial stiffness is the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-pulse wave velocity (PWV)),57 58 which is related to increased morbidity and mortality in patients with Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and in healthy participants.59 The Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (Cardio Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI)) is an index representing the stiffness of the aorta, femoral artery and tibial artery.60 Some authors suggest that Cardio Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI), which is independent of blood pressure (BP) at the time of measurement, has an adequate reproducibility for clinical use, and is more useful as a marker of arterial stiffness than cf-pulse wave velocity (PWV). It has also been observed that central BP is more related to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than peripheral BP.",18f75de1-8c83-4116-9543-1aa2ae0040f5

To amplify the 36b4 gene, we will use the primers: 36b4 F: 5′-CAGCAAGTGGGAAGGTGTAATCC-3′ and 36b4R: 5′-CCCATTCTATCATCAACGGGTACAA-3′; and to amplify the telomeres, we will use the primers TelF: 5′-GGTTTTTGAGGGTGAGGGTGAGGGTGAGGGTGAGGGT-3′ and TELR: 5′-TCCCGACTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTA-3′.  Blood samples will be collected in the primary care centre, and will be analysed at the University Hospital of Salamanca in external quality assurance programmes of the Spanish Society of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Pathology.  People who perform the different tests will be blinded to the clinical patient data.",3f097218-9a8f-43d3-806f-87010ff6ab86

36,analysis0,"Data input will be performed using the Teleform system (Autonomy Cardiff Vista, California, USA), with a questionnaire previously designed for the project. Normal distribution of variables will be verified using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Quantitative variables will be displayed as mean±SD if normally distributed or as the median (if normally distributed or as the median (IQR)) if asymmetrically distributed, and qualitative variables will be expressed as frequencies. Analysis of difference of means between variables of two categories will be carried out using a Student’ t-test or a Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate, while qualitative variables will be analysed using a χ² test. To analyse the relationship between qualitative variables of more than two categories and quantitative variables, an analysis of variance and the least significant difference test will be used in the post hoc tests; a Kruskal-Wallis test will be used in cases where the variables are not normally distributed.",5a8998a5-6cd5-46c3-913d-1fdd71345e24
37,analysis1," The relationship of quantitative variables to each other will be tested using Pearson or Spearman correlation as appropriate. Analysis of covariance (appropriate Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)) will be performed to adjust for the variables that can affect the results as confounders. A multivariate analysis of variance (multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)) will be performed in cases with more than one dependent variable to identify whether changes in the independent variables have significant effects on the dependent variables. The association between the variables studied (pulse wave velocity (PWV) and Cardio Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) with the independent variables analysed)) will be performed by multiple linear regression. Factors associated with the presence or absence of early vascular ageing (EVA) will also be analysed by logistic regression. Data will be analysed using the SPSS V.23.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). A value of p<0.",8d52ebdc-4835-472e-9740-13d3f60e7fcb

Statistical analysis of the extent of telomere length will be performed with the programs Step One 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems) and Enterprise GenEx 5.2.1.  To minimise the risk of bias resulting from foreseeable losses in the study, we will apply a process of multiple imputation to the original database, using the chained equations method proposed by van Buuren et al.87 Fifty files will be generated from this method, in which missing values will be replaced by their corresponding imputed values. Estimators obtained from each file will be combined by the method of Rubin.88 These processes will be carried out by the Ice88 and Mim programs, updated to V.14 of the statistical package Stata.

39,analysis3,"  Quality control Different processes will be carried out to guarantee the study data quality and thus maximise the validity and reliability of measurements of the results. To this effect, field work operation manuals have been prepared. These documents specify the adequate procedure for performing each test. Educational leaflets will be developed to ensure adequate pressure measurement by patients at home. All of these actions will confirm adequate performance of each procedure. Monthly meetings will be held with the principal investigator of the study to analyse the entire process, and an annual report on study progress will be prepared.  Project schedule This project will be performed in 3 years, with the aim to analyse factors that have an influence on early vascular ageing (EVA), estimated by cf-pulse wave velocity (PWV) and Cardio Ankle Vascular Index (Cardio Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI)), and to determine differences by gender in a Spanish population.",02ae6725-c4e7-4f7d-9324-c2b8fcba8884

Dissemination plan We will use a variety of methods to ensure that our work will achieve maximum visibility. Publication of our study protocol provides an important first step in this direction. In this paper, we have sought to offer a comprehensive overview of the relevant literature, while underlining current research gaps that necessitated the design and implementation of the early vascular ageing (EVA) study.  Similarly, the study results, given their applicability and implications for the general population, will be disseminated in research meetings and in at least five articles published in scientific journals.

42,discussion0,"Numerous studies5–9 have analysed the factors influencing vascular stiffness, finding that arterial ageing is related to changes in the mechanical and structural properties of the vascular wall, which lead to loss of arterial elasticity and reduced distensibility. However, to what extent these changes occur through the action of environmental factors, lifestyles, psychological factors, inflammatory parameters and oxidative stress molecules predisposing to early vascular ageing (EVA) has not been adequately studied. It is also not known which measure of arterial stiffness is best related to early vascular ageing (EVA).40 41 43 Thus, this study aims to provide evidence to clarify the influence and the relative weight of each of the factors on early vascular ageing (EVA), assessed using different tools measuring arterial ageing.11 12  The benefits of moderate physical activity on arterial stiffness, and therefore on early vascular ageing (EVA), are well known.",21565203-c778-4d22-b83b-614c88c79eae
43,discussion1,"15 Similarly, the number of hours dedicated to sedentary activities is associated with increased stiffness of the large elastic arteries and poorer vascular endothelial function.17 However, the effect of endurance exercises, alone or combined with aerobic exercises, on vascular ageing is not clear.17  The Mediterranean diet,27 accompanied by caloric restriction, improved vascular structure and function.26 However, the dietary parameters associated with decreased early vascular ageing (EVA) are not known.  Patients with depression,28 anxiety disorders34 or subjected to greater stress at work, stress at home, general stress and permanent stress35 have a greater risk of suffering Cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, we found no studies analysing the association of these factors with early vascular ageing (EVA). We hope this study will help clarify their influence on early vascular ageing (EVA).",55564aa9-5324-4be3-a352-30663b086a10
44,discussion2,"  It is known that smoking is harmful and that low or moderate alcohol consumption has a beneficial effect on Cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Nevertheless, the weight they have on early vascular ageing (EVA) has yet to be established.  We think that the project we are proposing has national and international relevance: the study of ageing and Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) has been established as a priority line of research in Europe and in Spain. To the best of our knowledge, there is no project in Spain or worldwide analysing in a population sample the majority of the potential factors currently known to influence early vascular ageing (EVA) and attempting to quantify the weight and relevance of each of them.",36db68c0-da42-4f3d-8b1a-db4342b05f46
45,discussion3," Therefore, we think that this is an original project and given the high prevalence of ageing of the population in our setting, a study to analyse the factors involved in arterial ageing will facilitate an understanding of this phenomenon and the degree of involvement of each factor in this process. In addition, it will provide knowledge for future research lines and potential clinical strategies.  Study limitations Although the study follows all the recommendations for observational studies considered in the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)) statement, there is the possibility of confounding factors that have not been considered. The cross-sectional design of this study may lead us to observe an association, but not its direction over time.",b86682c6-661f-4193-baee-df5130b85c54
