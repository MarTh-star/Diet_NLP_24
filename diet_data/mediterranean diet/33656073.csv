0,introduction0," Recruitment is essential for the success of clinical trials. We are conducting a randomized clinical trial to test the effect of a Mediterranean dietary intervention with or without 1700 mg/day of metformin for the prevention of age-related chronic diseases, the MeMeMe trial (Trial registration number: EudraCT number: 2012-005427-32 ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02960711). MeMeMe recruiting experience, highlighting strengths, limitations encountered and results is reported.  Patients and methods  Statistical analysis focused on the reasons for withdrawal according to the recruitment method (“active” versus “passive” criterion) and the time of withdrawal. Logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between the risk of withdrawal and sex, recruitment method, randomization arm, and with markers of compliance to the intervention, such as one-year change in body weight.

1,analysis0," The analyses included all volunteers who completed the personal data and medical history forms. The personal characteristics of the MeMeMe population were reported as frequencies. The metabolic and anthropometric characteristics were summarized by reason for entry, using means and standard deviation (SD) or frequencies, and compared using t tests or χ2, as appropriate. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was defined as body weight/height squared (kg/m2). All the variables showed normal distribution, with no need for transformation. Normality was firstly graphically checked by using histograms. Furthermore, we also used the Shapiro-Wilk test to confirm the normality of the parameters under study.  Statistical analysis focused on the reasons for withdrawal from the trial according to the recruitment method (people recruited through an “active” criterion compared with those recruited “passively”) and the time of withdrawal.",c119628e-9e5a-41f4-bf49-8b6a7f3d06c8
2,analysis1," We summarized four potential withdrawal times:  T0: before the baseline screening examinations  T1: after the baseline screening examinations but before randomization to metformin (MET)/placebo  T2: before the one-year examinations  T3: after the one-year examinations  Logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between the risk of withdrawal from the trial and sex, recruitment method, randomization arm, and with markers of compliance to the dietary intervention, such as one-year change in body weight. Age (quintiles) and Body mass index (BMI) at baseline (quintiles) were retained as covariates in the models. All the assumptions underlying the logistic regression model were firstly graphically checked and verified.  A p-value <0.05 was taken as significant. All statistical tests were two-sided. Analyses were done using the STATA 16 statistical package. ",796e4f99-1426-47d7-9a6d-80ecdf9c823b
3,results0," Out of the 2203 potentially eligible volunteers who gave signed informed consent and supplied their personal data, 2035 completed the medical history form and 1994 participated in the baseline screening, blood sampling, anthropometric and clinical examinations (Fig 1).  10.1371/journal.pone.0265495.g001 Fig 1 Flowchart of the MeMeMe study.  After the baseline examinations and the 30 days test with metformin (MET) 500 mg/day, 1448 people were properly randomized (Fig 1).  The present analysis refers to the 2035 people who completed the personal data and medical history forms. Among these participants, there were 64.6% women (mean age 62.2 ± 6.8 years) and 35.4% men (mean age 63.4 ± 6.7 years); 47.2% of the study population was in the age class 60–69 years. Most of the people were married and had a high school diploma. On the whole, adhering to a “healthy lifestyle” was the most frequent reason given for entry (Table 1).  10.1371/journal.pone.0265495.",292a6b24-152d-4489-b7b8-12224b31b4f4

At T0 41 individuals left the trial, refusing the baseline screening examinations. At T0 all the volunteers recruited through the “active” method left the trial for “changing idea” without specifying their reason. At T1 546 volunteers left the trial, before randomization, mainly due to a lack of inclusion criteria: people recruited through the “passive” method did not have MetS significantly more than people recruited “actively” (p<0.001). We did not find any other significant difference between the two groups.  At T2 and T3 305 volunteers left the trial after randomization, 68% of whom had been recruited through the “passive” method.",b9e91fc5-e19a-4247-a0d1-e37aa27424ef
5,results7," Among the 1448 subjects randomized, 497 were recruited through the “active” method and 951 through the “passive” approach. Therefore, as regards people who actually dropped out of the trial after randomization (at T2 or T3), there were 19.5% for the “active” and 22.0% for the “passive” methods (p = 0.28).  Among these 1448 participants randomized, 30 (2%) left the trial for intolerance to metformin (MET) (27 in the metformin (MET) group and 3 in the placebo group), and 275 (19.0%) for “changing idea”. About half the participants who withdrew from the trial for “changing idea” were in the placebo group (51%) and half (49%) in the metformin (MET) group.  We used a logistic regression model to explore in the whole population the associations between the risk of withdrawal from the trial after randomization, and sex, recruitment method, randomization arm and a marker of compliance to the intervention, such as the one-year change in body weight.",73a6a499-93e1-4a99-a066-5962825db85d
6,discussion0," Our findings suggest that people who adhered to our trial of MedDiet and metformin (MET) interventions entered mainly because of interest in changing their lifestyle. In line with this, volunteers who left the trial after randomization were more frequently participants who failed to lose weight after one year of intervention.  The decision to start, continue, or withdraw from a trial in a population setting is often based on multiple factors, with significant variability across studies. In the MeMeMe, a higher Body mass index (BMI) at baseline and older age at recruitment were significantly associated with higher risks of withdrawal.  Our findings also suggest that volunteers who decide to participate in a prevention trial tend to drop out when they do not see any early beneficial effect.",c51e108d-b7dc-4c92-b801-63ccd84d68d3
7,discussion1," In fact, although the goal of the MeMeMe is the prevention of chronic diseases over time, the lack of weight loss at the end of the first year of intervention was an important risk factor for withdrawing from the study, especially for women. This should teach us to be even more careful in explaining to volunteers the aims of the trial, the importance of remaining in it despite their perceived results, and in understanding each participant’s actual motivations.  The results also suggest that the “passive” recruitment method was more effective than the “active” one to boost the numbers of recruits. However, among people who did not enter randomization (T1) because they did not meet the MetS criteria, 75% had been recruited “passively”.  This picture outlines a complex scenario for RCT researchers.",e223b8ea-220e-40a6-996a-907510a1dd8e
8,discussion2," On one hand, the active search and recruitment of targeted candidates, with the help of general practitioners and clinical units dealing with overweight and metabolic diseases, might be useful for smooth admission of participants into the trial, but this approach risks giving a very low enrollment rate. On the other hand, passive recruitment using advertising in newspapers and mass media, with less concern about their metabolic condition and/or their motivation for entering the trial, might give a better enrollment rate, but it may result in fewer participants being randomized because of the lack of inclusion criteria or higher drop-out rate, or both.  Despite these considerations and in line with the recruitment methods of other health programs [16,17], in our trial the benefits of “passive” recruitment hardly outweighed the drawbacks.",5750b340-6f2a-4932-84d5-3e1f591e0b24
9,discussion3," In fact, considering people who actually left the trial after randomization (T2 and T3), the frequency by recruitment method did not substantially differ (19.5% for “active” and 22.0% for “passive”).  A previous study suggested that the use of monetary incentives helps investigators in recruiting [18] but this practice is unusual in Italy and we did not provide any money for the participants. As for the costs of “passive” recruitment (advertising, billboards, posters, etc.), we spent less than 2% of the total ERC funding. If we had allocated 5% of the total funding (100,000 Euro) exclusively for mass media advertising, we would have reached the recruitment objective in a shorter time.",8ef1e85e-d901-4533-9881-914066308406
10,discussion4,"  After randomization, 87% of participants attended the one-year MeMeMe examinations, a smaller proportion than in another big primary prevention lifestyle trial such as the PREDIMED [19] but quite similar to a larger trial with a mixed intervention (metformin (MET) and lifestyle) for the primary prevention of type-2 diabetes [20]. In all, 21% of volunteers left the study after randomization (19% for “changing idea” and 2% for metformin (MET) intolerance) and this was lower than in the Diabetes Prevention Program.  Gastrointestinal adverse events are typical of metformin (MET) treatment, in particular diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal discomfort. Trials in diabetics reported a prevalence of 15–20% of these adverse events in patients given metformin (MET) 1500 mg/day or more. In our trial, only 2% of people taking metformin (MET) 1700 mg/day withdrew.",c90b0038-c78c-4078-9dec-c891a12bf2cb
11,discussion5," Probably the 30 days of metformin (MET) 500 mg/day (trial period) served to exclude any intolerant subjects before randomization, and increasing the dosage of metformin (MET)/placebo (one 850 mg tablet/day of metformin (MET)/placebo) for the first two months after randomization, before starting the full treatment, helped reduce the prevalence of gastrointestinal adverse events.  Our findings about recruitment and withdrawal might have low external validity, given the setting and population focus, and this is the limit of the present analysis. However, we think that our experience might be useful to researchers who involve in clinical trials healthy subjects. In fact, our results suggest that healthy people are probably more attracted to messages from mass media/social channels rather than communications from healthcare professionals.",9f5106a8-d6de-4d1c-b1ad-aff6a299297d
12,discussion6,"  MeMeMe is a unique, innovative trial that includes two types of intervention, using metformin (MET) with or without the MedDiet for primary prevention in people at risk because of age (>50 years) and the presence of a MetS. Therefore, people who volunteer to enter a trial that involves two almost opposing preventive interventions—the use of a drug or the change of dietary habits—have multiple reasons for entry and individual objectives.  Conclusions  In the MeMeMe trial the “passive” recruitment method was more effective than the “active” one to advance recruitment and boost the number of volunteers. Furthermore, the benefits of “passive” recruitment hardly outweighed the drawbacks. People who adhered to the trial entered mainly because of interest in changing their lifestyle. In line with this, volunteers who left the trial after the randomization were more frequently participants who failed to lose weight after one year of intervention.",fe513e06-485b-419e-97bb-00605256ac61
13,discussion7,"  MeMeMe is currently completing the three years of follow-up (on average). We believe this trial will help clarify the importance of the MedDiet for primary prevention and the role of metformin (MET) as a potential chemopreventive agent.
