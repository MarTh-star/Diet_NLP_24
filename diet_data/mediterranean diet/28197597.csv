0,introduction0,"Cardiovascular disease (Cardiovascular disease (CVD)) is the leading global cause of death, claiming an estimated 17.3 million lives in 20131.  Oxidative stress and systemic inflammation are important contributing factors in the development and progression of Cardiovascular disease (CVD)2–4. Diet, which contributed to an estimated one in two cardiometabolic deaths in the United States in 20105, may play an important role in modifying oxidative stress and inflammation. However, evidence for the effects of diet on CV outcomes mainly relies heavily on observational data. Therefore, the results of the multicenter “Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED)) resulted in a paradigm shift in nutrition recommendations for preventing Cardiovascular disease (CVD).",99e7bde6-533b-4ccb-ad4a-8c1643b66081
1,introduction1," Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) tested the hypothesis that the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is more effective in preventing Cardiovascular disease (CVD) than a relatively low-fat diet in a rigorous randomized-control fashion6.  Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) enrolled 7447 participants free of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline, but at a high risk for Cardiovascular disease (CVD), who were randomized 1:1:1 to three groups: two caloric-unrestricted MedDiet groups receiving either ~1 liter per week of extra-virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) or 30 g of mixed nuts per day, and one group counseled to follow a low-fat diet6.",b5f2d59f-6eaa-40f8-ae6f-e1603f50e22e
2,introduction2," The low-fat diet counseling included encouraging lean fish and poultry, low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and starches including bread, pasta, potatoes, and rice while minimizing use of oils, nuts, fatty fish and meats, commercial baked goods, and fried foods. Objective compliance to the respective Mediterranean diet intervention was tested with plasma alpha-linoleic acid (nuts group) and urine hydroxytyrosol (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group) at baseline, 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The trial was terminated early, after interim analysis revealed a dramatic divergence for the primary end point between the groups at median follow-up of 4.8 years. Analysis revealed an impressive relative risk reduction of 30% in the primary composite outcome (acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from CV causes) for the two MedDiet groups compared to the low-fat control diet group (Fig. 1)6. The reduction of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was particularly evident for stroke.Fig.",3e5e041b-e055-4e71-b900-4b3aef41d1e2

With permission from Estruch et al.6    It is important to note that the benefit of the Mediterranean diet in the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) trial was likely due to numerous factors, notably a high-unsaturated fat content7, 8, as well as the effects of other macro and micronutrients and polyphenols. It is impossible to distinguish which dietary factor led to the most benefit, most likely the summation of beneficial factors in the Mediterranean diet9, 10.",304afffe-83f7-4049-b7f5-dd5aa57254df
4,introduction4,"  This review, however, will discuss the overall MedDiet tested in the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) and more specifically will focus on the ability of dietary polyphenols and vitamin antioxidants on altering oxidative stress, and most importantly, clinical outcomes.  Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) population and baseline oxidative stress level Conducted in Spain, Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) was a multicenter randomized-controlled trial that enrolled men and women 55–80 years of age with a high risk for Cardiovascular disease (CVD)6. To be enrolled, participants either had type II diabetes (50%) at baseline or three or more risk factors as follows: current smoker (14%), dyslipidemia (>70%), overweight/obese (>90%), and family history of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (22%).",25dcba19-e497-4cd3-9848-d79c1aaccbc2
5,introduction5," When a sample of the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) cohort (n = 527) was compared to healthy controls (n = 25) before randomization, it was found that oxidative stress markers including damaged DNA base 8-oxo-dG, malondialdehyde (malondialdehyde (MDA)), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and the GSSG/glutathione (GSSG/glutathione (GSH)) ratio were increased, revealing a more negative oxidative stress profile in the individuals with high Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk11. Increased GSSG is usually associated with early atherosclerosis in healthy adults12. However, in addition to oxidative stress levels, is important to analyze the endogenous antioxidant activity13. Endogenous antioxidant activity, measured as catalase (catalase (CAT)) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, were higher in healthy subjects11, suggesting that in addition to lower oxidative stress levels, there was an increased antioxidant defense.",9e0dd15c-71fc-4f7e-9e92-abd40987f038
6,introduction6," Interestingly, a different sample of Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) (n = 1069) found that increasing GPx activity was linearly associated with increasing blood glucose and oxidized Low-density Lipoprotein (LDL)14. The authors suggest this may be an indicator of the oxidative stress balance, likely in this case, an antioxidant response to increased presence of oxidative stress as compensatory mechanism14. Such findings suggest that a comprehensive assessment of oxidative stress level in association with endogenous antioxidant capacity should be recommended for a clearer picture of the overall oxidative stress/antioxidant balance.  Returning to the previous sample of 527 subjects, the presence of hypertension was the most important risk factor in determining differences in oxidative stress parameters11. Most of the oxidative stress measures listed above (i.e.",8539622e-18da-414c-90c2-60d122f3240e
7,introduction7,", higher GSSG, GSSG/GSSG/glutathione (GSH) ratio, trend toward higher malondialdehyde (MDA)) were increased in hypertensive subjects compared to those without hypertension. It should be noted that the activity of endogenous antioxidants GPx and superoxide dismutase (superoxide dismutase (SOD)) were also significantly increased in hypertensive subjects but were still at significantly lower levels than the healthy controls11.  This baseline data on the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) cohort demonstrates an elevated oxidative stress in individuals at high Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, creating ample opportunity to explore the effect of the MedDiet.  Effects of MedDiet on endogenous antioxidant systems The MedDiet’s beneficial effects are usually attributed to the action of nutrients within foods consumed but the overall dietary pattern may also enhance the body’s endogenous defenses through mechanisms not fully understood15.",dee9b013-70e2-465e-aa91-00616581661c
8,introduction8," A small sample (n = 75) of the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) cohort was analyzed for the effect of dietary intervention influence on plasmatic antioxidant and pro-oxidant activity prior to and post intervention16. In this study, prior to dietary intervention, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)- or nuts-supplemented groups presented lower plasma activity of antioxidant extracellullar superoxide dismutase (SOD) (EC-superoxide dismutase (SOD)) and catalase (catalase (CAT)) activity compared to healthy controls. After intervention (median 4.8 years in entire cohort), activity of EC-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) was enhanced in both MedDiet groups16. Additionally, pro-oxidant xanthine oxidase (XOX) had decreased activity in both MedDiet groups.",e8725963-8c7f-407c-953c-5d9f01b5f5cd
9,introduction9," When further analyzed for degree of adherence as measured by questionnaire, plasma antioxidant activity of EC-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) increased with greater adherence to the MedDiet, while pro-oxidant XOX activity decreased with greater MedDiet adherence16. However, no differences were seen in plasma markers of oxidative damage and no differences were seen in functionality of serum myeloperoxidase or whole blood and blood cell EC-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)16. When total antioxidant capacity (total antioxidant capacity (TAC)) of serum was measured in another subset of Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) participants (n = 187), the subjects randomized to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-supplemented MedDiet and nuts-supplemented MedDiet had greater total antioxidant capacity (TAC) than the subjects randomized to the relatively low-fat control diet17.",1441805c-253c-41f9-bc42-218646cf54d3
10,introduction10," Within extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)- and nuts-supplemented MedDiet groups, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-supplemented MedDiet induced an even further increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared to the nuts-supplemented MedDiet17. In an additional analysis of this substudy, the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was also associated with weight loss in the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intervention group, suggesting that greater total antioxidant capacity (TAC) may be involved in body weight regulation. However, a major limitation of this additional analysis was that total caloric intake was not included in the multivariate17, therefore we cannot determine whether such association was independent of total energy intake. From this subanalysis, however, it is not possible to determine whether total antioxidant capacity (TAC) directly affected body weight, or viceversa, suggesting the need for further study.",aec5b480-e7bb-439b-9c99-0e7eae7fd846
11,introduction11,"  Importance of dietary antioxidants and polyphenols Dietary vitamin antioxidants and polyphenols have been explored extensively as an exogenous mechanism of defense against oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and finally, the development of non-communicable disease18–20. Increased dietary antioxidant content (i.e., vitamins and polyphenols) has been associated with reduced incident of heart failure21, stroke22, coronary artery disease23, and cancer24. It should be emphasized that this does not include antioxidant supplementation, which does not decrease mortality25.  The MedDiet is rich in both vitamins and polyphenols, which are mainly, but not exclusively contained in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), and red wine26. The traditional vitamin antioxidants are usually beta-carotene (vitamin A precursor), vitamins C, vitamin E, and often the mineral selenium27.",70d3d866-9a99-484d-a91c-f505dc522441
12,introduction12," In contrast, polyphenols encompass a wide range of secondary plant metabolites characterized by a large number of phenol groups28. Polyphenols are produced in response to a threat (e.g., radiation, pathogens)29 and it has been hypothesized that their protective ability may also have importance in the human body30. Multiple hydroxyl groups make polyphenols strong antioxidants but they also carry anti-inflammatory properties31. In fact, they can interfere with a number of proinflammatory pathways such as the Nod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein (NLRP)3 inflammasome, nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)28, 31.",66bd40c1-06f9-4ca0-ad00-87ef8305d684
13,introduction13," Particularly, in vitro studies suggested that the inhibition of these transcription factors or macromolecular complexes induced by polyphenols may reduce the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin(IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a), which have in turn, been associated with adverse CV events28, 32. However, their powerful in vitro anti-inflammatory effects may not necessarily translate to the same beneficial effects in vivo, as polyphenols bioavailability varies quite considerably33.  Effect of dietary antioxidants An analysis of the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) focused on total dietary antioxidant capacity—including all compounds with antioxidant potential (vitamin antioxidants and polyphenols)34.",78f2ff43-a3c0-46a4-880a-70f81a4dfeae
14,introduction14," The quantity of both polyphenols and vitamin antioxidants was determined by dietary intake information collected by validated 137-question food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) for all participants at baseline and then once annually during follow-up6. Total dietary antioxidant capacity was then determined by converting the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to the 24-h dietary recalls and then using a database with antioxidant potential of each food determined by a specific assay34. In this analysis of the entire Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) cohort, those who where in the highest quintile of total antioxidants consumption presented a non-significant 15 and 21% relative risk reduction in overall and CV mortality for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED), respectively. There was no correlation found between antioxidant consumption and cancer-related mortality34.",de79d744-ba51-496b-ab36-9cff801ade98
15,introduction15,"  Effect of dietary polyphenols While the role of vitamin antioxidants in the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) was, to date, only discussed in one study34, the effects of polyphenols were far more extensively studied. At baseline, for the 7200 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) subjects who completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), the main source of polyphenols was fruit, followed by non-alcoholic beverages (i.e., coffee, orange juice, tea), and vegetables35. As for individual sources, coffee (18%) was the main food source of total dietary polyphenols, followed by oranges (16%), apples (12%), olives and olive oil (11%), and lastly, red wine (6%). However, this substudy did not assess potential changes of polyphenols sources over time, which may have occurred when participants were randomized into the dietary intervention groups6.",0e5412b6-ef68-45d5-9bb2-68a99c5c7bbe
16,introduction16," Of note, Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) was conducted in a Mediterranean country (Spain), which likely influenced baseline dietary pattern and therefore sources of polyphenols.  In another analysis of Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) participants (n = 7172), which only included those with a baseline food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and plausible energy intake, a multivariate analysis adjusting for age, BMI, smoking status, physicial activity, and energy intake, as well as selected nutrient intake, medications and CV risks, found that individuals in the highest quintile vs. the lowest quintile of polyphenols intake measured by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) had a significant 46% relative risk reduction in the primary composite CV outcome36.",7a620f9d-06b6-4c71-bb5e-ba6542e1202b
17,introduction17," However, when the three randomized groups were analyzed individually, this association was only apparent in the control group assigned to the relatively low-fat diet36. The authors postulated that this was possibly influenced by the relatively small event rate in both MedDiet intervention groups36. Interestingly, the subjects in the highest quintile of polyphenols presented a relative mortality risk reduction of 37% compared to those in the lowest quintiles of polyphenols intake37. However, the authors noted this was not a strong linear association and the association lessened after the lowest quintile of polyphenol intake was removed from the analysis. Figure 2 demonstrates the separation in crude mortality rates of the partcipants divided into tertiles by low, medium, and high consumption of polyphenols37. When looking at the individual polyphenols, the polyphenols associated with the greatest all-cause mortality reduction were stilbenes and lignans37.",e7df8aec-db3a-488c-bf07-5206e21fe791
18,introduction18," Such results were confirmed also in relation to the primary outcome, indeed the top quintile of consumption of the polyphenol lignan was associated with a 49% relative risk reduction of the composite CV primary outcome of the study36. Although the mechanisms underlying such improvements are still largely unknown, lignans exert a number of potential beneficial effects such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-tumor properties38. The greatest source of lignans in the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) cohort was extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)34 and another Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) analysis demonstrated a potential ability of the polyphenols present in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) to downregulate the expression of pro-atherosclerosis genes and related inflammatory and lipid oxidative markers39.Fig.",2ea49dd9-3132-4d83-bcaf-1b352ca71c14

With permission from Tressera-Rimbau et al.37    Of note, polyphenol content can differ dramatically between different olive oil products. extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has the highest content of polyphenols with four main groups of phenol compounds: simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol), flavonoids, secoiridoids, and lignans40. Hydroxytyrosol is particularly important also due to its urinary excretion, which allows to measure compliance to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption41. Moreover, hydroxytyrosol has the highest antioxidant potential of the phenol compounds contained in olive oil, at least in vitro39.  The influence of polyphenols on inflammatory markers and CV risk factors was also investigated.",60a42145-b071-4e3d-9342-b5ca413a5146
20,introduction20," Total polyphenol excretion (Total polyphenol excretion (TPE)) in the urine is a validated method of dietary polyphenol quantification42. One substudy of randomly selected Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) subjects (n = 1139) demonstrated that individuals in the two MedDiet cohorts (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts) significantly increased their Total polyphenol excretion (TPE) after 1 year of intervention and decreased systemic inflammatory biomarkers from baseline including circulating vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, (VCAM-1), soluble inter cellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), IL-6, TNF-α, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1)43. Conversely, these molecules with potential detrimental effects increased in the control group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance43.",75674981-5585-4ee5-b771-666f02edf905
21,introduction21," When all patients were separated into tertiles based on changes in Total polyphenol excretion (TPE), a difference was demonstrated between the highest and lowest tertiles of increase in Total polyphenol excretion (TPE) and the change in levels of the inflammatory biomarkers listed above (i.e., VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-6, TNF- α, MCP-1)43.  The substudies and analyses contained in this section present the possibility that polyphenol intake is linked to systemic inflammation and overall mortality. However, it must be taken into consideration that the polyphenol analyses36, 37 were extrapolated from the main study6, which was not initially designed to look at the effects of polyphenols. Moreover, although the investigators performed several statistical adjustments to the multivariate analysis to minimize the potential of confounders, it is possible that other confounding factors existed and for which the statistical analysis could not fully account for.",0e4c1864-0c89-4bac-80c8-e3a9757e6f98

In the entire Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) cohort, this effect was less preminent, and no clinically significant diastolic blood pressure-lowering was observed in the MedDiet groups versus the control after 4 years of follow-up46. Higher quintiles of Total polyphenol excretion (TPE) were also associated with increased NO levels and the authors attributed the blood pressure-lowering effects of the MedDiet to the action of the polyphenols on increasing NO, therefore causing vasodilation, as previously shown in vitro45.  The studies presented above suggest that polyphenol intake may have a blood pressure-lowering effect44, 45.",3be91263-a4a0-43f4-982a-c4f1a5698680
24,introduction24," However, it should be noted that both studies44, 45 are very small samples of the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) cohort46.  Total polyphenol excretion (TPE), incident type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity Incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was a pre-specified outcome of the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) trial47. A subgroup analysis of 3541 participants showed a 52% relative risk reduction of T2DM after a median follow-up of 4.0 years in the combined MedDiet groups, even in absence of body weight and physical activity changes over the duration of the study48.

Protection against weight gain is one plausible mechanism by which higher dietary polyphenols may help prevent new-onset T2DM, but a recent review also suggested several mechanisms for the association between polyphenols and reduction in T2DM risk including improved insulin sensitivity, reduction of oxidative stress, and systemic low-grade inflammation51.  It is important to note in the two studies mentioned above assessed polyphenols differently—one by dietary intake49 and the other by Total polyphenol excretion (TPE)50. Additionally, all three studies mentioned contain 50% or less of the total Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) cohort48–50.

26,discussion0,"Individuals with high CV risk who consume high amounts of polyphenols may present a lower risk of developing CV events and mortality by potential modulation of risk factors such as systemic inflammation43, obesity50, blood pressure44, 45, and T2DM49.  Only one substudy of the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) analyzed the effects of vitamin antioxidants on major CV events34, so their individual contribution to the different end points of the study cannot be determined.  It is acknowledged that the evidence regarding polyphenols presented in the above paper was not a pre-specified outcome of the orginal Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) trial.

27,discussion1," Morevoer, while multivariate adjustment is performed in most of statistical analyses, it is impossible to fully adjust for every possible confounding factor. Additionally, causation cannot be proven by such studies and appropriately powered randomized-controlled dietary trials of polyphenols modulation are required to expand these observations.  Polyphenols often are consumed in the form of fruits, vegetables, and other plant-derived food products52 that have nutrients such as dietary fiber with established health benefits53, but also extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)54 and nuts55. Within the limitation of the studies analyzed herein (i.e., limited sample size, subgroup analysis), the evidence would suggest that polyphenols are a powerful piece of the puzzle that makes the MedDiet a powerful prevention tool in the hands of the provider (Fig. 3). In addition to polyphenols, however, the MedDiet is also very rich in unsaturated fatty acids (unsaturated fatty acids (UFA)).",7e0c01ba-30bf-46a4-9eaf-3cd0b92a1cb2

However, food rich in unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) are often also rich in polyphenols (i.e., extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)), making it very difficult to differentiate the beneficial individual effects of one component or the other. The difficultly of disentangling the beneficial effects of the dietary intervention versus the more comprehensive Mediterranean dietary pattern has been fully acknowledged by the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) investigators57.

30,discussion4,"  A notable limitation of the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) is the minimal guidance the low-fat diet participants received in the first 3 years of the trial. Though both groups received baseline dietary counseling, the MedDiet groups received follow-up in the form of personalized, quarterly counseling but the low-fat diet participants only received an annual informational pamphlet. This was admended due to the concern for bias and low-fat diet participants began receiving personalized counseling as frequently as the MedDiet groups in 2006. Importantly, after analysis, no difference in benefit was demonstrated with respect to enrollment period between the MedDiet and the low-fat groups suggesting the initial lack of counseling intensity did not influence results.",54d23dad-42b1-4a7f-9cf0-156c556cb8c9
31,discussion5," Another major limitation of the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) is that the study was performed only in Spain, in a population with a diet that is partly already reflective of the MedDiet. There is therefore an urgent need to explore extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nut supplementation in a non-Mediterranean population60. Recently, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute created a working group in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute and Office of Disease Prevention to address this interest in the context of a MedDiet intervention in the American population61, 62. Reflecting on the compelling evidence presented above for the beneficial effects of a polyphenol-rich Mediterranean diet, this is much needed for the future of preventative CV care in America.

32,discussion6," Overall, mortality and cardiometabolic mortality/events were focused on in Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED), but evidence also suggest potential benefit in cognitive health64, 65, cancer66, and even incidence of fractures67. It is now clear that in the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED) cohort the MedDiet supplemented with nuts or extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) reduces cardiac events. The evidence presented above shows that polyphenols likely contribute to this effect through lowering inflammatory biomarkers, blood pressure and reduction of new-onset T2DM, and obesity.

33,discussion7," In fact, a recent presidential advisory from the American Heart Association68 recommended to increase the consumption of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), and substituting saturated fatty acids for unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) to prevent Cardiovascular disease (CVD), without specific recommendation on the amount of calories deriving from total fat or unsaturated fatty acids (UFA).  To date, however, we do not have enough evidence to determine whether the high polyphenol content or the high unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) content is the major driver of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, perhaps a combination of the two may exert the greatest benefits.",539e1ed6-fa9f-4489-897f-07c8f6a33d09
34,discussion8,"  Conclusion In conclusion, the high polyphenols content of the MedDiet and the increase in the overall antioxidant endogenous system seen in patients assigned to supplementation of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts, may explain, at least in part, the beneficial effects reported in the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet” trial (PREDIMED). However, the studies presented herein have limitations, and future study is needed to determine whether polyphenols or unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) play a major role in preventing Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic disease, and importantly, whether the overwhelming beneficial effects of the MedDiet can be replicated in a non-Mediterranean countries.
