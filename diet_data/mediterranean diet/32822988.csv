0,methods0," 2.1. Food Collection and Analysis  We measured the sodium and potassium content in food samples collected from markets and stores in Northern Italy, as previously described [29,30]. Briefly, we identified foods most frequently consumed in a typical Italian diet [31,32]. We selected relevant food items characterizing the Italian diet [33], with particular reference to the Emilia-Romagna Region using previous population-based studies addressing the dietary habits of subjects of this Northern Italy community [34,35].  We purchased selected food and beverages in two provinces of the Emilia-Romagna region, namely Modena and Reggio Emilia in the period of October 2016–February 2017. During sample handling, we tried to avoid metal cross-contamination using plastic food containers and plastic and stainless cutlery. We also used a food blender equipped with a stainless-steel blade. After homogenisation, we aliquoted 0.",89eab2e1-1eac-4424-ae1a-7efc518aec73

Sample digestion was performed using 10 mL solution (5 mL HNO3 + 5 mL H2O) in a microwave system (Discover SP-D, CEM Corporation, NC, USA). Digested material was stored in plastic tubes and diluted to 50 mL with deionised water before analysis. We measured the sodium and potassium concentration using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (Agilent 7500ce, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). All analyses were performed in duplicate, implementing standard quality controls as previously described [36,37]. A total of 908 food study samples were analyzed. Limits of quantification were 0.02 and 0.10 mg/kg for sodium and potassium, respectively, with corresponding limits of detection (limits of detection (LOD)) of 0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg.",995b8357-56b1-466b-a172-dedfcb7f6f39
2,methods2," Values for 35 and 9 samples for sodium and potassium, respectively, were below the limits of detection (LOD) and were set equal to limits of detection (LOD)/2 [38].  2.2. Study Population and Assessment of Dietary Habits  We assessed habitual dietary intakes of a Northern Italy community in the period 2005–2006. We identified a large population sample from the databases of the Emilia-Romagna Region–National Health Service directories of five provinces (Bologna, Ferrara, Modena, Parma and Reggio Emilia). Inclusion criteria were age > 18 years, and residence in one of the studied provinces. From the random sample of 2825 eligible subjects invited to participate, a total of 747 subjects accepted (response rate of 26.4%), and were therefore recruited. The study was authorized by the Modena Ethics Committee (approval no. 71.11/2011). All participants provided written informed consent and returned study material for collection of individual characteristics.",189c4bb2-5af0-4f37-8021-62077d1a90a5
3,methods3,"  To estimate dietary habits, we administrated the food frequency questionnaires (food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)) implemented within the ‘European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition’ project. The EPIC-food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) is a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), and we used the version specifically developed for the population of Northern Italy [39]. Frequency and amount of consumption of 188 food items were estimated over the previous year. Accurate completion by participants was ensured through photos of foods and serving sizes. For quality data control, we excluded incomplete food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)s or those reporting extreme and implausible values of energy intake; i.e., <0.5th or >99.5th percentile, based on the ratio of total energy intake to calculated basal metabolic rate, which excluded 28 subjects [40].",a797106b-55e3-41dd-9705-1a0146fdd17c
4,methods4," The final study sample was 719 adult participants, including 319 men and 400 women, none of whom reported ‘special’ dietary requirements or habits such as weight control or vegetarian/vegan diet during the survey. We eventually estimated daily dietary intake (mg/day) as previously reported by multiplying the quantity of sodium and potassium in foods (mg/kg food as consumed) with the corresponding food intake determined from the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) (in g/day) [41] and we calculated the sodium-to-potassium (Na/K) ratio.",c896fc68-3558-4ca3-9dc9-4258101627d9
5,methods5," For daily dietary intakes, we also performed stratified analysis by sex and by adherence to the Italian Mediterranean Index (Italian Mediterranean Index (IMI)) [42], and to the Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND)) pattern, which combines the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) and the Mediterranean diet, with the aim of reducing the risk of dementia [43,44]. We used frequency and quantity of food and beverage intake as assessed through the EPIC-food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) to evaluate the adherence to the investigated dietary patterns.",1f7c0741-bd17-41e5-a32a-341fbaf2d9cd
6,methods6," In particular, we implemented specifically developed routines for the scoring system of both the Italian Mediterranean Index (IMI) and Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets.  The Italian Mediterranean Index (Italian Mediterranean Index (IMI)) was developed by the Epidemiology and Prevention Unit of the Milan National Cancer Institute [45] by adapting the Greek Mediterranean Index to typical Italian eating behavior. The score is based on intake of 11 items: 6 typical Mediterranean foods or food groups (pasta; typical Mediterranean vegetables such as raw tomatoes, leafy vegetables, onion and garlic, salad, and fruiting vegetables; fruit; legumes; olive oil; and fish), 4 non-Mediterranean foods (soft drinks, butter, red meat, and potatoes), and alcohol consumption.",40542188-6ee1-45fe-8507-67ea234cfd9d
7,methods7," One point was given for consumption of each typical Mediterranean food in the upper tertile of the distribution, and for consumption of each non-Mediterranean food in the bottom tertile; all other dietary components received 0 points. Alcohol received 1 point for intake up to 12 g/day; abstainers and persons who consumed >12 g/day did not receive any points. The range of possible scores was 0–11. Similarly, the Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) pattern has 15 components, including 10 brain-healthy food groups (green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, white meat (fish and poultry), olive oil instead of other oil, and wine-intake limitation), as well as a decrease in 5 unhealthy food groups, including red meats, butter and stick margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets, and fried/fast food. Scores range from 0 to 15, with higher values meaning greater adherence [46].",084ce1a4-6601-4ad4-9d1b-895e015b6730
8,methods8," Additional general guidelines for the Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet are consuming at least three servings of whole grains, a salad and one other vegetable, and a glass of wine each day. In addition, nuts are used as a snack on most days and beans every other day. Poultry and berries are recommended at least twice a week and fish at least once a week. It is essential to limit the intake of the Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet’s “unhealthy food groups”, especially butter (less than 1 tablespoon a day), cheese, and fried or fast food (less than a serving a week for any of the three) [46]. For both diets, we used the mean value as cutpoint for identification of poor and high adherence.",4192b9cc-7d8d-4e82-87b4-30f6c1276991
9,methods9,"  We checked the normal distribution of variables using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and we used a t-test for independent samples to compare differences between means. We used linear regression analysis to investigate the relation between the Na/K ratio and adherence score to both Italian Mediterranean Index (IMI) and Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) patterns, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and energy intake. We reported beta regression coefficients and values of the predicted Na/K ratio together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used Stata statistical package (v17.1 Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA, 2021) for all statistical analyses.  3. Results  Characteristics of the study participants are reported in Table 1.",74141c6e-60a2-4b13-88fa-8b775bcda5cb
10,methods10," Out of the total 719 included participants, there were 319 men, median age 60 (interquartile range-interquartile range (IQR): 50–69) years and 400 women, median age 53 (interquartile range (IQR): 41–63) years. Nearly half of the participants had educational attainment of high school or more, and the vast majority lived with partners (married or unmarried). Body mass index distribution showed a general tendency to overweight with a median value of 25.1. The median energy intake was 1907 kcal/day, higher in men (2025 kcal/day) than in women (1801 kcal/day). Adherence to the Italian Mediterranean Index was moderate with approximately 60% of subjects having a score equal or above the median value of 4, and a similar higher proportion of subjects appeared to adhere to Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) pattern, with a mean score of 7.5.",07b01fc0-5d73-4698-a38a-8a3863683143
11,methods11," Mean intake of specific food categories demonstrated comparable dietary habits in both sexes, except for a slightly lower consumption of cereal products (206.4 g/day vs. 174.2 g/day), meat (142.4 g/day vs. 117.2 g/day) and beverages (mainly due to wine: 191.4 g/day vs. 73.9 g/day) in women, while men had a lower consumption of milk and yogurt (159.4 g/day vs. 212.5 g/day), coffee and tea (120.6 g/day vs. 170.6 g/day) and a slightly lower intake of vegetables (154.1 g/day vs. 161.4 g/day) and citrus fruits (207.0 g/day vs. 223.8 g/day) (Supplementary Table S1).  The average sodium and potassium content of food is reported in Table 2. The highest sodium levels were found in processed meat (12.0 g/kg); fish and seafood, especially preserved and tinned fish (13.0 g/kg); followed by bread, rolls, and other prepackaged cereals and salty snacks (5.4 and 6.2 g/kg, respectively). In addition, cheese (5.2 g/kg), butter, and other animal fats (3.",8ced8fea-f311-4934-b981-b9248d0e1ae6
12,methods12,"7 g/kg) showed a higher sodium content compared to milk (4.4 g/day) and vegetable/olive oils (<0.3 g/kg), respectively. Conversely, the highest potassium levels were found in legumes (10.0 g/kg); dry fruits (7.2 g/kg); followed by meat, especially white meat (5.3 g/kg); mushrooms (5.1 g/kg); vegetables (3.1 g/kg); and potatoes (4.1 g/kg). Food containing lower sodium levels were fresh fruits (14.8 mg/kg), followed by almost all beverages (35.4 mg/kg), while rice demonstrated the lowest value (8.0 mg/kg) compared to other cereal products. Lower levels of potassium were found in almost all dairy products (1.2 g/kg), beverages (0.5 g/kg), and oils and fats (0.1 g/kg).  The dietary intakes of sodium and potassium in the study population are reported in Table 3 and Table 4. Overall mean intakes were 2.2 g/day and 3.4 g/day for sodium and potassium, respectively. Foods contributing the most to sodium intake were cereals (33.2%); meat products (24.",613c0721-ae8c-4442-96e6-ffd5b819c4d6
13,methods13,"5%), mainly processed meats; followed by dairy products (13.6%) and vegetables (12.6%). For potassium, they were meat (17.1%), fresh fruits (15.7%), and vegetables (15.1%), and with relevant contributions from cereals and dairy products (11.6% each) and beverages (10.8%). Men had overall intakes that were only slightly higher than women for both sodium (2.2 vs. 2.1 g/day) (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3) and potassium (3.4 vs. 3.3 g/day) (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5).  In Figure 1, we present a comparison between sodium and potassium intake from all food categories, their contribution to the overall intake, and the food-specific Na/K ratio. Cereals overall had a higher Na/K ratio, although pasta and rice had a lower Na/K ratio. Similarly, fish and seafood favored sodium with high Na/K ratios for preserved/tinned fish and crustaceans/mollusks, while other types of fish showed the opposite relationship.",1890b7b5-ee48-4e2c-bef0-84e5bef02546
14,methods14," Similar patterns were noted for dairy products with Na/K ratio in favor of potassium for milk and yogurt, but not for cheese. Interestingly, legumes, potatoes and particularly fresh fruits intakes were in favor of potassium and the same for beverages, mainly driven by coffee, tea and wine. It is noteworthy that amongst oils and fats, olive oil only showed a Na/K ratio in favor of potassium whereas the intake of both animal fats and other vegetable oils greatly increased sodium intake.  The distribution of sodium and potassium intake divided below (<4) and above (≥4) the median adherence to the Italian Mediterranean Index showed no substantial influence on sodium intake (2.2 vs. 2.1 g/day for low and high adherence, respectively) (Table 5). Conversely, subjects with adherence above the median score of the Italian Mediterranean Index demonstrated substantial higher potassium intake (3.1 vs. 3.6 g/day). Substantially identical findings were observed when dividing below (<7.",270de11b-1a0f-4a7a-9403-aeb3522081e5

Finally, the increase in adherence to Mediterranean and Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) patterns was linearly associated with a decrease in the Na/K ratio, from a predicted value based on linear regression analysis of 0.77 (95% CI 0.74–0.80) in the subjects with lowest adherence to the predicted value of 0.50 (95% CI 0.47–0.53) in the highest-adherent ones (Figure 2). Similar relationships were noted with the Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) pattern, with a predicted Na/K ratio of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79–0.87) in the lowest-adherence subjects and 0.47 (95% CI 0.43–0.51) in the highest ones (Figure 2).  4.",c1485cad-284c-4816-95ab-1a6fb290d84b
16,methods16," Discussion  In this Northern Italy community, we found that the mean sodium intake was above the current internationally recognized dietary recommendations of 1.5–2 g/day for adult populations [26], while the mean potassium intake was slightly lower than the dietary recommendation of 3.5 g/day [9]. Compared to previous Italian surveys, we found a small decrease in the average sodium intake when compared to the 3.8 g/day reported by the Italian Total Diet Study (Total Diet Study (TDS)) 2001–2002 [23]. The most recent 2008–2012 Cardiovascular Epidemiology Observatory/Health Examination Survey (CUORE) survey showed substantially similar intakes with values of 2.3 and 1.9 g/day for men and women, respectively [24].",c843b52b-1bc8-4209-8453-10a547cd2c09
17,methods17," As regards potassium, our results were similar to intakes reported in the recent surveys which generally reported a potassium intake >3 g/day [24,27,47], although differences between sexes were less marked compared to other surveys, without an appreciably higher intake in men compared to women [27,28]. As a consequence, it is not surprising that higher adherence to the Mediterranean and Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets is associated with a general decrease of Na/K ratio. That lowering effect seemed mainly driven by an increase in potassium intake, since sodium intake was only slightly affected while potassium increased at higher levels of adherence to the investigated dietary patterns.",86da95d9-516d-4eb5-b0f6-04e1fea832f6
18,methods18,"  Despite the fact that there is no single definition of Mediterranean diet, it usually describes the traditional diet of populations residing in areas bordering the Mediterranean Sea, and is characterized by a high consumption of plant-based foods (such as vegetable, legumes, fruits, and nuts), preference for whole-grain cereals, fish and dairy products instead of other sources of refined carbohydrates and animal proteins [48,49]. Other features include the daily consumption of olive oil and moderate intake of alcohol (mostly red wine) during meals [49]. However in recent decades, there has been a gradual decline in adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet in favor of Western dietary habits characterized by an unbalanced intake of foods that may lead to micronutrient deficiencies [50].",3d685c1b-1d9c-4da0-a609-0ce95b25d48a
19,methods19,"  In spite of the general assumption of high adherence of Italians to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, this is unfortunately not true, since a gap still exists between the recommendations and the real dietary pattern, especially in most recent years [51,52]. Habitual salt intake in Europe is approximately 10 g per day [53] of which unprocessed foods represented approximately 12% of total salt intake but the majority (over 75%) occurred from processed food consumption [53,54,55] rather than from discretionary salt. The assessment of dietary sodium intake in free-living individuals is challenging due to high day-to-day variation, diversity in sources (naturally present, added during food processing, and discretionary use of salt at home) and the general trend for an overall reduction in salt concentrations of processed foods in recent years.",3a98ad7c-125a-43b3-877a-619e600af354
20,methods20,"  Our findings suggest that increased adherence to Italian Mediterranean Index (IMI) and Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) patterns has limited effects on sodium intake, but it leads to an almost adequate potassium intake. For individuals, World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a sodium intake <2 g/day and a potassium intake >3.5 g/day [56,57] which would yield a Na/K ≤0.6, a ratio of intake considered beneficial for health in order to decrease blood pressure and generally improve cardiovascular health [52,58]. Foods showing the lowest Na/K ratio were fresh and dry fruits, most vegetables, legumes, and beverages, in accordance with previous surveys [47,59]. Conversely, among other categories, processed and prepackaged cereals (particularly salty and sweet snacks), processed meat, cheese, and non-olive oils and fats demonstrated higher values according to our findings and those reported previously [59,60].",97362b57-edbc-4935-abd8-79e8059fd2df
21,methods21," In addition, efforts to decrease Na/K ratio could include specific indications supporting the use of low-sodium products, the gradual reduction of added salt to allow progressive adaptation towards a more sensitive taste, and the use of salt substitutes rich in potassium [61,62].  Our study population is generally characterized by good adherence to the Mediterranean diet [63]. However, more than a third of subjects (38%) in the study population had scores between 0–3 out of a maximum score of 11 points, indicating that improvement in dietary habits is both possible and definitely needed. Various longitudinal studies have analyzed the benefits of a Mediterranean diet in comparison with other types of diet [64,65,66,67]. These studies have shown that people with good adherence to a Mediterranean diet have a better quality of life and greater life expectancy, along with a decreased prevalence of chronic diseases [68,69].",b3450428-928a-41fa-b9c3-74b0ebfc1534
22,methods22," Evidence has been accumulating that the Mediterranean diet may provide a substantial benefit by reducing the risk of many chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD) disease, e.g., through maintenance of blood pressure and endothelial function [70,71].  Our study has some limitations. We did not include the quantity of drinking water in the intake of beverages, but it is considered a trivial source of both sodium and potassium [55,72,73]. In addition, we did not account for discretionary salt use since the EPIC questionnaire only assessed the habit to add salt when subjects do not eat at home. Moreover, we recruited only healthy adult subjects, and the results cannot be generalized to other populations e.g., children and the elderly, the latter being potentially more vulnerable to adverse effects in relation to excess sodium intake.",21e7d5d0-770c-45f7-aae2-21b144f19a15
23,methods23," In addition, since the recruitment period was carried out during 2005–2006, dietary habits of the population may have changed over time, although recent results from 2008–2012 showed similar values of intake of sodium and potassium [24], suggesting a relatively stable intake in a population without intervention specifically aimed at improving dietary habits. Finally, considering the ten-year gap between the time of population sampling and food analysis, we cannot entirely rule out that some changes over time may have occurred towards a sodium reduction and thus partially biased our estimates, especially due to a decrease in salt in processed foods [74]. Small, though still limited, changes in the sodium content of processed and restaurant foods appear to have occurred in more recent years [75,76,77].",210d3259-bc81-4ac9-8aec-b3c8995bc36f
24,methods24," However, the relatively low intake of processed and prepackaged foods in the study population, and the evidence that high sodium levels are still found in these products, despite efforts by the food industry in lowering its concentrations [78] suggests that our assessments are likely still currently valid.  One strength of our study is that we measured the sodium and potassium content of a large number of food samples and beverages that represent habitual dietary patterns of Northern Italy, and were therefore able to assess sodium and potassium dietary intakes with a high degree of accuracy. In addition, we estimated dietary intakes in a randomly selected large population sample from the Emilia-Romagna region. Although its dietary characteristics could be generally similar to those of other Italian populations [45,79], some peculiarities may be present due to the regional differences in plant growing and animal husbandry.",ffe5e377-a8ef-4019-b5c3-1353270a7ab8
25,methods25," However, the 2008–2012 survey was carried out with recruitment of participants from 21 municipalities across the country [24], among which Modena municipality only has been considered, and in addition no specific data about sodium and potassium was made available [80].  Finally, as regards the assessment of dietary habits, we estimated both sodium and potassium intake along with adherence to Mediterranean diet in our study community through implementation of the EPIC-validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) in the version tailored for dietary habits of the population of Northern Italy [81]. Although there is a European consensus that two non-consecutive 24 h dietary recalls are the preferred methods for the estimation of sodium intake when using a dietary survey at the population or group level [82], the implementation of the EPIC-food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) should be considered a strength of the study.",2814db8b-5099-478a-9eb4-fcf685f8c60b
26,methods26," The EPIC-food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) assesses frequency and quantity of consumption over an entire year, and takes into account intakes of seasonal food, supporting its substantial validity and reproducibility for the assessment of dietary habits in the adult population [83].  5. Conclusions  Our study provides an updated assessment of foods that contribute to sodium and potassium intake in a Northern Italy community. We found a mean sodium intake of 2.2 g/day, which exceeds the dietary recommendation for adults of 1.5–2 g/day, whereas the mean potassium intake was 3.4 g/day, which was slightly lower than the recommended 3.5 g/day.",927bf417-db52-4838-99ae-e826b5967215
27,methods27," Our findings suggest that higher adherence to Mediterranean diet and Mediterranean–Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) patterns has no effect on sodium intake, but may have a beneficial influence on potassium, favoring the achievement of the recommended dietary intake though a decrease in the Na/K ratio, notably by higher intakes of fresh and dry fruits, most vegetables, legumes, and beverages, as well as a reduction in processed and prepackaged foods.
