0,methods0," 2.1. Participants  In this cross-sectional study, 498 college students (aged 18–22 years) who had taken a body composition survey and 488 who had taken a dietary intake survey in a university located in an urban area and its’ affiliated school located in a suburb in Beijing were assessed. The sampling of college students was carried out randomly according to different grades. Finally, 474 individuals finished all of the projects. All subjects signed informed consent before they were included.  2.2. Assessment of Dietary Intake  The Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) of 2002 China National Nutrition and Health Survey (CNHS 2002) [19] was used to collect dietary intake information, which obtained the habitual consumption of foods over the past year. The total dietary intake of each nutrient was calculated by summing the nutrients from all food items reported in the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)s.  2.3.",d1c9c752-e52f-40e7-bb8b-957d11a57e07
1,methods1," Derivation of Dietary Patterns  Factor analysis of principal components (principal components (PCA)) is a multivariate statistical procedure to empirically derive dietary patterns. After measuring the sampling adequacy by the Kaiser Meyer–Olkin test (0.749) and Bartlett’s test of sphericity (p = 0.000), principal components (PCA) was applied to derive patterns from the food groups and determine factor loadings for each group. The varimax orthogonal rotation was carried out in order to simplify the interpretation of the data. The salt and soy sauce in 28 kinds of food were combined and named as “equivalent salt”. A total of 27 factors were retained based on the scree plot (Figure S1) and the standard criterion of eigenvalues >1.5, which were defined as major dietary patterns [20,21,22]. Absolute factor loadings above 0.30 were considered to contribute significantly to the pattern. Consequently, a four-factor solution was found, with factor 1 explaining 11.",c1559702-bb7a-4579-8f7d-e6758c6d1584
2,methods2,"190% of the variance, factor 2 explaining 9.458%, factor 3 explaining 9.407%, and factor 4 explaining 7.462%. Together, they explained 37.517% of the total variance. The factor scores for each pattern and for each individual was determined by summing the intake of each food group weighted by the factor loading [21].  2.4. dietary inflammatory index (DII) Score and Dietary Intake Assessment  The dietary inflammatory index (dietary inflammatory index (DII)) was used to assess the inflammatory potential of diet according to Shivappa et al. [23] and our previous study [24]. The energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (DII) was calculated to reduce the bias induced by different energy intake in accordance with the published procedures [25,26].  The daily intake on average for each food item was calculated according to the Diet Balance Index 2016 (diet balance index (DBI)-16) [16], a revised version from the Chinese Diet Balance Index 2007 (diet balance index (DBI)-07) [27].",16709784-2a36-41c6-a96a-72af4751ae9d
3,methods3," diet balance index (DBI)-2016 comprises 14 subgroups of 8 components from the dietary guidelines for Chinese residents [28], including: (1) cereal; (2) vegetable and fruit; (3) dairy and soybean; (4) animal food (red meats/products/poultry/game, fish/shrimp, and egg); (5) empty energy foods (cooking oils and alcoholic beverage); (6) condiments (additional sugar, and salt); (7) diet variety; and (8) drinking water. A score of 0 for each diet balance index (DBI)-16 component means that the individual has achieved the recommended intake of the corresponding food group. Positive scores (ranging from 1 to 12) indicate the excessive intake level of cereals, red meat/products/poultry/game, eggs, cooking oils, alcoholic beverage, addible sugar, and salt, while negative scores (ranging from −12 to −1) indicate the inadequate intake level of cereals, vegetables, fruits, dairy, soybeans, red meat/products/poultry/game, fish/shrimps, eggs, diet variety, and drinking water.",101f44ea-ace9-460e-8297-954856a5ec77
4,methods4," Considering the difference of nutrient requirements in energy consumption, the scoring of these 14 food subgroups was based on 11 levels of energy intake.  Based on the scores for each diet balance index (DBI)-16 component, three indicators of diet quality were calculated: (1) the lower bound score (lower bound score (LBS)), an indicator for inadequate food intake, was computed by adding all the negative scores; (2) the higher bound score (Higher bound score (HBS)), an indicator for excessive food intake, was calculated by adding all the positive scores; (3) the diet quality distance (diet quality distance (DQD)), an indicator of unbalanced food intake, is calculated by adding the absolute values of both positive and negative scores [16]. The ranges of lower bound score (LBS), Higher bound score (HBS), and diet quality distance (DQD) were 1 to 41, 1 to 31, and 10 to 61, respectively.  2.5.",6010ef7c-f297-4972-a7bc-ab6e5fa5282a
5,methods5," Body Composition Assessment  Body compositions were assessed using of a bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA) (Inbody 770 Co., Seoul, Korea). Measurements were taken according to the manufacturer’s protocol [29]. An experienced tester instructed that each participant stood and held the handle accurately so that the voltage was always measured at the same point. For accuracy, please see the consistency verification study of bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA) and dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) conducted at the Mayo Clinic [30]. Our participants were in a fasting condition and urinated just before the body composition analysis to obtain the exact result. This device directly estimated the raw bioimpedance parameters (e.g., impedance, reactance, and phase angle). The related equation could be found in the professional research [13]. body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the ratio of body mass to height squared (kg/m2).",5165ef2a-83fe-4369-acc1-fe0c15968088
6,methods6," The calculation of other body components was obtained by Inbody 770 Co. through electrophysiology combined with the relevant literature (not publicly available).  According to the Working Group on Obesity in China, obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of at least 28 kg/m2 and overweight was defined as 24 kg/m2 ≤ body mass index (BMI) < 28 kg/m2. A person with 18.5 kg/m2 ≤ body mass index (BMI) < 24 kg/m2 was normal weight, and <18.5 kg/m2 constituted thinness [21]. Body composition was assessed, including fat mass index (FMI), fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)), and so on. The percentage body fat (percentage body fat (PBF)) indicates the significant percentage of body fat to body mass. The body weight without fat is “fat-free mass”. visceral fat area (VFA) was an assessment of fat stored in the abdominal cavity. A waist circumference above 90 cm for male and 85 cm for female is abdominal obesity [31].  2.6.",04193f48-570a-44f6-8aed-290a52887e09
7,methods7," Statistical Analysis  After testing the normality of data by the Shapiro–Wilk test or the Kolmogorov–Smirnova test, the variables were presented as means or medians, followed by the SD or interquartile range. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni’s correction or Kruskal–Wallis tests were applied to compare means or medians across different body mass index (BMI) levels and the scores of dietary patterns. The χ2 test was used for categorical variables, which were presented using absolute and relative frequencies. To examine the associations of dietary patterns, diet quality, body composition, and body mass index (BMI), both multivariate linear regression models and multiple logistic regression were employed. Specifically, Model 1 was unadjusted, while Model 2 was adjusted for gender, age, basal metabolic rate (BMR), and total energy intake (kcal). All regression models were assessed for normality by the examination of the model residuals plotted.",38c84ff0-0dfd-47f7-8625-2ec4118fd18a
8,methods8," After evaluating collinearity and residuals, the results were presented containing the β coefficients or odds ratio (OR) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The continuous independent variables were converted into categorical variables in order to use multivariate logistic regression. The classification principles were as follows: patterns 1–4 and dietary inflammatory index (DII) were divided by quartile, and Higher bound score (HBS), lower bound score (LBS), and diet quality distance (DQD) were divided into three grades by diet balance index (DBI)-16 (Higher bound score (HBS): 1–9 was suitable, 10–18 was low excessive intake, and over 19 was medium high excessive intake; lower bound score (LBS): 1–12 was suitable, 13–24 was low inadequacy intake, and above 25 was medium and high inadequacy intake. diet quality distance (DQD): 1–17 is suitable, 18–34 is low dietary imbalance, and above 35 is moderate to high dietary imbalance).",4849078a-0da8-4c0f-90ef-0ae0f4da7427

The references for body fat percentage, abdominal obesity, visceral fat area, and waist–hip ratio were <25% in male and <30% in female, male < 90 cm and female < 85 cm [33], below 100 cm2 and <0.9 in male and <0.85 in female [34]. p < 0.05, which was two-tailed, was considered statistically difference. All analyses were performed using the statistical software package IBM SPSS Statistics version 21® (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).  3. Results  3.1. Overall Sample Characteristics  Participants were divided into four groups according to body mass index (BMI) (Table 1). There was no difference in age among four groups, but the gender composition was significantly different (p < 0.05). The rates of overweight/obesity were much higher in male than in female.",82eec8b5-0793-49f5-bd5c-8a9a23f34931
10,methods10," There was a statistical difference in abdominal obesity among the four groups (p < 0.05). No participants in the thinness group suffered from abdominal obesity, while 96.3% subjects with obesity had abdominal obesity. Interestingly, there was 3.7% abdominal obesity in normal body mass index (BMI) individuals, and almost half of subjects had abdominal obesity in overweight college students. Compared with the normal-weight group, all of the indices related to muscle mass and fat mass in the overweight and obesity groups were higher than those in the normal-weight group, but the indices in the thinness group had completely opposite results (p < 0.05). Fat-free mass, soft lean mass, skeletal muscle mass, and skeletal muscle mass index of the individuals in the obesity group were significantly higher than those in the overweight group (p < 0.05). People with obesity had more intake of flour and fried foods.",0aadd5a1-29b2-47ff-b20e-4eeeaca07e98
11,methods11," Students with overweight and obesity consumed more energy than normal-weight students (p = 0.062), which could be seen as demonstrating a statistical difference. In addition, the energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (DII) score had a higher trend in participants with obesity compared with the subjects in other groups, but no significant difference could be found. There was no significant difference in diet balance index (DBI)-16 score as well.  3.2. Dietary Pattern Characterization  Four dietary patterns were identified and labeled: pattern 1, pattern 2, pattern 3, and pattern 4. These patterns explained 11.190%, 9.458%, 9.407%, and 7.462% of the total variance, respectively. Pattern 1 was characterized by aquatic products, nuts, processed meat, bean productions, and beer. Pattern 2 was characterized by cereals, tubers, fruits, flour food, and milk.",678eb11c-1e8b-462d-ab70-a977075b0253
12,methods12," Pattern 3 was characterized by high-calorie foods and the high intake of salt, including fried food, sweets and desserts, red meat, equivalent salt, flour food, poultry, oil, and drinks with sugar and rice. Pattern 4 was characterized by the intake of various vegetables, mushroom, red meat, red wine, and eggs (Table 2).  The distribution of the four dietary patterns of college students was different in gender. The distribution of girls tends to be even in four patterns. On the contrary, boys were more inclined to consumption pattern 3 (29.9%) and pattern 4 (36.1%). Students who followed pattern 3 had the highest fat mass index (FMI), visceral fat area (VFA), waist–hip ratio, and fat mass index (FMI)/fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)) ratio compared with the people following other patterns (p < 0.05).",eee13a09-3fde-4370-ba89-1aced2957c22

The nutrient characteristics of four patterns were also evaluated in this study. Participants following pattern 1 had a higher percentage of energy intake from protein and more bean-derived protein. A higher intake of PUFA, including DHA and EPA, was also the characteristic of pattern 1 (p < 0.05). Participants following pattern 2 had a higher percentage of energy intake from carbohydrates, and the intake of both vitamin C and potassium were higher (p < 0.05). Pattern 3 had the highest intake of fat and a higher percentage of energy intake from carbohydrates. Subjects following pattern 3 had a higher intake of vitamin B3 (p < 0.05).",a149f391-9edc-45d6-934b-144977fc4d6a
14,methods14," The feature of pattern 4 was a higher percentage of energy intake from protein and a higher intake of animal-derived fat and PUFA (p < 0.05). Moreover, energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (DII) was higher in pattern 2, and the diet balance index (DBI)-16 score tended to be higher in pattern 3 (p < 0.05) (Table 3).  3.3. Association of Dietary Patterns and Dietary Scores with body mass index (BMI)  Linear regression analysis showed that fat mass index (FMI) and fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)) were positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) in all three models (p < 0.05). Model 1 is adjusted by no factors. Model 2 is adjusted for age and gender. Model 3 is additionally adjusted for basal metabolic rate (BMR) and energy based on model 2. In addition, pattern 2 was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) in model 2 (β 0.339, 95% CI 0.068, 0.610, p = 0.014), but it disappeared when in model 3 (β −0.032, 95% CI −0.478, 0.413, p = 0.886).",d2180d13-c5fa-4814-8292-e1f249a2318a
15,methods17," Medium- and high-level lower bound score (LBS) (OR 26.62, 95% CI 2.03, 349.71, p = 0.013) was a risk factor for thinness, while low- (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01, 0.49, p = 0.008), medium-, and high-level diet quality distance (DQD) (OR 0.03, 95%CI 0.00, 0.40, p = 0.008) were protective factors for thinness (Table 5).  3.4. Association of Dietary Patterns and Dietary Scores with Body Compositions  Pattern 1 had no significant correlation with fat mass index (FMI) and fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)) in all three models (p > 0.05) (Table 6). Participants with a higher pattern 2 score had higher fat mass index (FMI) in model 1 and higher fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)) in model 2, but the relations all disappeared in model 3. Participants who adhered pattern 3 had a higher fat mass index (FMI) in model 2 (β 0.201, 95% CI 0.006, 0.395, p = 0.043).",19fe97b5-e696-456c-9679-2b94881577c1
16,methods19," Furthermore, diet quality distance (DQD) was negatively correlated with fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)) both in models 2 and 3 (β −0.021, 95% CI −0.036, −0.006, p = 0.007; β −0.012, 95% CI −0.022, 0.002, p = 0.015). The negative correlation was also found in diet quality distance (DQD) and fat mass index (FMI) in model 1, but it disappeared after adjusting model 2 and 3 separately. Energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (DII) was positively correlated with fat mass index (FMI) for p = 0.061 in model 2 (β 0.024, 95% CI −0.011, 0.037), and it was positively correlated with fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)) in both models 1 and 2 (β 0.041, 95% CI 0.018, 0.063, p = 0.000; β 0.022, 95% CI 0.007, 0.038, p = 0.005).  Participants following pattern 3 had higher red meat products and poultry intake of Higher bound score (HBS) (p < 0.05), while the variation in lower bound score (LBS) was insignificant among different dietary patterns.",382c9720-0b87-4d41-b661-fc57d0c5354e
17,methods20," Red-meat-derived protein was higher in pattern 3 and pattern 4. In pattern 3, poultry-derived protein was higher. Pattern 1 and pattern 3 were higher than pattern 2 and pattern 4, respectively, in processed-meat-derived protein (p < 0.05). Participants following pattern 4 had a higher egg intake of lower bound score (LBS), which was similar to the RNIs/AIs of eggs than pattern 1 and pattern 3 (p < 0.05) while Higher bound score (HBS) was insignificant between different dietary patterns. (Table S1).  4. Discussion  The abnormal body composition of youth college students seriously affected their physical health, and further increased the risk of long-term chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases [35]. In our subjects, 17.06% had overweight, and 5.42% had obesity. The rates of overweight/obesity were much higher in male than in female.",488bf419-a503-4b2c-9570-b24a17983488
18,methods21," Regarding the problem of abdominal obesity in college students, it needs to be noticed that, not only people with overweight and obesity accounted for a high proportion (49.4% and 96.3%, respectively), but also 3.7% of abdominal obesity was invisible in a person of normal body mass index (BMI). Therefore, body mass index (BMI) could not fully reflect the physical health of the youth, and body composition should be considered comprehensively. This opinion has also been proven by others [8], that fat mass index (FMI) and fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)) could be useful for the measurement of obesity in college students. Our results showed that fat-related indices, such as percentage body fat (PBF), fat mass index (FMI), and visceral fat area (VFA), and the waist–hip ratio and fat mass index (FMI)/fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)) were much higher in people with overweight/obesity.",a941deac-6468-4957-965d-4f8d1471f548
19,methods22," In addition, the fat-free indices including FFM, fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)), soft lean mass, skeletal muscle mass, and skeletal muscle index were also higher in a person with overweight/obesity. This phenomenon was similar to the research [36] that indicated people with high body mass index (BMI) exhibited higher total leanness on the Mediterranean diet.  Four dietary patterns calculated by a factor analysis of principal components were discovered in our subjects, which were found to be correlated with body mass index (BMI) and body composition.  Pattern 3, which we named ‘Western dietary pattern’, was positively associated with body mass index (BMI) in this study.",8519034d-c6be-45dd-bef4-6c690ad07e5c
20,methods23," Because of the highest intake of fat compared with other dietary patterns, the fat-related indices including fat mass index (FMI), visceral fat area (VFA), and waist–hip ratio were the highest in youths who preferred pattern 3 than others, but the fat-free indices, such as fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)) and skeletal muscle index, were not. These were similar to the other studies [37,38], which showed that the odds ratios of obesity increased across the quartiles of the nutritional pattern primarily consisting by saturated/mono-unsaturated fatty acids. A recent study found [39] that the animal-driven nutrient pattern (characterized by animal protein and saturated fat) was significantly associated with the increase of fat mass index (FMI), which is similar to our result. Another characteristic of pattern 3 was sweets and desserts.",2ee20f10-78e6-401b-9c16-2b1149865e9d
21,methods24," There is similar evidence that unhealthy plant foods, including fruit juices and sugar-sweetened beverages, could increase the risk of abdominal obesity [39], and the consumption of sugars seems to have a close relationship with the variables of body composition, especially in visceral fat and muscle mass [40]. Furthermore, there is a significant correlation between the consumption of the vitamin B group (vitamin B3, with OR = 1.01) and an increased risk of excess weight in those aged 6–18 years [40], and the plasma concentrations of vitamin B3 in the Emirati population with obesity were significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers [41]. A similar result was found in our study. More interestingly, we found that, after adjusting for basal metabolic rate (BMR) and energy, the original no association between pattern 3 and fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)) turned into a significantly negative correlation.",db9b9f01-9d06-4652-be1d-3c7e90e74e34
22,methods25," In this case, the energy intake and basal metabolic rate (BMR) of individuals should be taken into account in evaluating the physical health of youth. As the above results showed, the higher incidence of overweight and obesity in young male college students might be related to a stronger tendency towards the unhealthy dietary habits of pattern 3, especially abdominal obesity.  The Mediterranean diet represents a dietary pattern that incorporates the healthy traditional eating habits of populations from countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, which includes the high consumption of vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, beans, fish, and unsaturated fats, such as olive oil and red wine [42,43]. In the present study, pattern 4, which was partly consistent with the Mediterranean diet, provided a similar conclusion, that vegetable-based nutrient patterns have been linked to a lower risk of overweight and obesity [44].",c5fb5eef-3c66-497b-a731-80c46d3cfc2a
23,methods26," More evidence showed that numerous vegetables were inversely related to weight and the consumption of fruits and vegetables was related to a low percentage of fat [29]. Nutrients analyses found that, not only the consumption of lower carbohydrate and total fat, but the proper number and quality of protein (more bean-derived protein and not less animal food-derived protein) is another characteristic of pattern 4. This was definitely an important reason for good health, with effective body fat control in college students, which could find similar results in research of a low-carbohydrate Mediterranean (low carbohydrate Mediterranean (LCM)) diet [45]. The proper proportion of red meat (Table 2 and Table S1) was also the healthy beneficial factor of pattern 4, which may also be reflected in the negative correlation between Higher bound score (HBS) and fat mass index (FMI) (Table 3 and Table 6).",4884a11c-238d-42e7-b995-e5bc2c508177
24,methods27," Students who followed pattern 4 had a lower visceral fat area (VFA) and fat mass index (FMI), while some muscle-related indicators such as fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)), SLM, FFM, and SMM tended to be higher than other patterns. This was consistent with the results that a high level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a high level of muscular fitness in Spanish university students [36]. More proof [46] demonstrated that women with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet had higher appendicular lean mass index (ALMI, appendicular lean mass/height squared).  In order to further exploring the quality of different diet, diet balance index (DBI)-16 and energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (DII) was calculated [16,23,24] and used to describe dietary patterns in the present study. Results that supported pattern 2 had higher dietary inflammatory index (DII), and pattern 3 also tended to be the unbalanced diet.",a4beb3d6-d7f4-4b00-92db-39810a469c96
25,methods28," This was consistent with the previous results of overweight/obesity and body fat distribution. The same conclusion could be found in other research [47,48,49], which showed that high dietary quality in adolescents can improve nutrient status and be associated with a lower percentage of body mass. Samanta T. Valdés [45] reported that overweight individuals were more predisposed to vitamin deficiency, due to differences in the intake of dietary fruit, vegetables, and energy by individuals with overweight and obesity as compared to individuals of normal weight.  Linear regression analysis and multiple logistic regression showed more interesting and valuable results. Results confirmed the fat mass index (FMI) and fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)) could be used for the measurement of obesity in college students.",d9281f62-09b8-484f-816e-d181f5068f19
26,methods29," Second, based on different dietary habits, basal metabolic rate (BMR) and total energy intake could be the main determinants for the physical health based on different dietary habits among young people. Moreover, dietary quality is significantly associated with body mass index (BMI). dietary inflammatory index (DII), which was adjusted by energy, was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI). A moderate and high level of lower bound score (LBS) was the risk factor for both thinness and overweight. The valuable explanation could be found in Table 6. Not only body mass index (BMI), but also fat mass index (FMI) and fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)) (both fat and muscle indices), need to be concerned comprehensively in the evaluation of relationships.  In addition, some of the diet-related indices mentioned in this paper, such as dietary inflammatory index (DII), have been combined with bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA) applications [50].",cf8dd8a0-0da2-4d1b-a84c-5c2129657404
27,methods30," A recent paper [29] used the bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA) technique (InBody 770 scanner), which is highly in accordance with our study, to find the relationship between nutrient patterns and metabolic syndrome. Several obesity-related studies were also using the bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA) device [29,50,51,52,53]. These indicated that bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA) can be well developed in the most areas. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the promotion of bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA) among college students, especially Chinese youth.  There were two key points showed in the present study worthy of being paid attention to in the young population. One was that bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA) is the best option because of the better consistency with dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA).",64de3b17-4196-4e43-b7ed-dd36c6999a23
28,methods31," Although the application of this method is still widely used in people with obesity [29,50,51,52,53], the related study for Chinese college students [54] is limited. Therefore, bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA) may be applied in Chinese college students with abnormal body mass index (BMI) or body composition in the future. Another concern is normal-weight obesity (normal weight obesity (NWO)). body mass index (BMI) is usually used to evaluate overweight/obesity. However, 13 of the 352 normal body mass index (BMI) students in present study had abdominal obesity. The incidence of normal-weight obesity (normal weight obesity (NWO)) need to be concerned. bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA)-derived indicators, such as fat mass index (FMI) and fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)), basal metabolic rate (BMR) and energy intake, should be used comprehensively to analyze the physical health of college students.  There were some limitations as follows.",eeff6d8a-f9da-4f7f-a2c8-303cb5522a71
29,methods32," Firstly, it has been reported that the assessment of nutrient patterns rather than dietary patterns has more advantages resulting from the structures. Their structures are not affected by special traditional behavior such as food preparation. Secondly, no causal inference could be made due to the cross-sectional nature of the study. At last, the limited number of participants might reduce the representativeness of objective population. Further studies should be conducted in future.  5. Conclusions  bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA)-derived indexes, such as basal metabolic rate (BMR), fat mass index (FMI), and fat free mass index (Ffat mass index (FMI)), might be key determinants in the definition of overweight and obesity in the youth population. A high-calorie dietary pattern that are highly loaded with refined grains, processed food, and condiments, which was close to the Western diet, could be the main dietary risk factor for obesity and abnormal fat distribution.",c3dc8458-fc56-444a-8f47-0822f304d4d9
30,methods33," A healthful dietary pattern, characterized by the consumption of various vegetables, red wine, and a high quality of protein, similar to the Mediterranean diet, could help maintaining a reasonable weight and basal metabolic rate (BMR) in youth. Energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (DII) and diet balance index (DBI)-16 were could be used to effectively assess dietary quality and the risk of overweight/obesity. The application of bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA) in Chinese college students should be emphasized. These findings provide new perspectives for future health promotion interventions and behavior change among Chinese youth.
