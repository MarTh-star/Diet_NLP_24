0,introduction0,"Ageing can be defined as the time-dependent functional decline that affects most living organisms. At a cellular level, it is accompanied by several hallmarks including genomic instability, oxidative stress, cellular senescence, deregulation of nutrient-sensing pathways, senescence and stem cell exhaustion1.  Human ageing, in particular, is characterised by vast heterogeneity at both a cellular and organismal level2. This heterogeneity has given rise to the notion that biological and chronological age differ from one another; the former being the advancement of the biological ageing process and the latter being the passing of time3.  A typical ageing phenotype with clear discrepancy between biological and chronological age is cognitive decline; while some individuals retain intact cognitive performance, others display dramatic deterioration4.",8917b3fe-494d-4ff2-8b94-85b480d6f77c
1,introduction1," Brain ageing presents with vast alterations throughout several sub-regions, each playing an important role in determining its phenotypic presentation both in ordinary and pathological conditions5. Studies aimed at identifying mechanisms responsible for age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s dementia, for example, have emphasised an important role for the hippocampus and its residing neural stem cells (NSCs)6. In humans, episodic memory is the cognitive function mapped to the hippocampus and it is particularly important in age-related cognitive decline and progression to dementia7,8. In line with this, rodent models have repeatedly linked NSC maintenance and the resulting adult hippocampal neurogenesis to ageing and cognitive decline9–11. Human adult neurogenesis has been debated for decades and recently prominent journals have published opposing results about its presence and rate of decline during ageing12,13.",4a996c6c-0abf-43c2-be5b-7a58ba506023
2,introduction2," Yet, the general consensus remains that a modest but important neuronal turnover occurs in the human neurogenic niche and that this process is likely involved in cognitive ageing and neurodegenerative disorders14–17.  Interestingly, studies investigating NSC function in cognitive ageing have shown that the circulatory system alone can affect NSC maintenance, neurogenesis and cognitive decline11,18. This suggests that environmental factors able to alter the composition of the systemic environment, such as diet and exercise, can affect the rate of age-related cognitive decline potentially explaining some of ageing’s heterogeneity19. Indeed, recent longevity studies suggest only a minor role for genetics and a far greater effect of environmental factors than initially predicted20–22.",93eb9ece-0836-4eee-9eb7-0c6e48cbccb9
3,introduction3," While calorie restriction is the most widely studied dietary intervention with respect to longevity, diets based on the presence of specific nutrients have been repeatedly linked to improved cognition and neurogenesis during ageing23–25. Similarly, exercise has been associated to improved cognitive abilities in both animal and human studies, suggesting lifestyle can impact the rate of cognitive decline26–28.  Animal models have shown nutrient-sensing pathways, such as the insulin and insulin-like growth factor1 (insulin and insulin like growth factor1 (IIS)), mTOR and sirtuin pathways, can provide the molecular basis for the association between lifestyle and ageing. Furthermore, these pathways have been implicated in stem cell maintenance, suggesting they could also be involved in the interaction between lifestyle, NSCs and cognition29.",62488f8b-6691-44c9-9f1d-be004e2c246c
4,introduction4," Though animal models have provided overwhelming evidence supporting a role for the mTOR30, sirtuin31 and insulin and insulin like growth factor1 (IIS) pathways32 in longevity, only limited studies have confirmed their role in human models33. Notably, among these are several studies suggesting a link between FOXO3a polymorphisms and human longevity21,33,34. Identifying the driving mechanisms behind cognitive decline and understanding the environmental and genetic causes of its phenotypic heterogeneity will provide new therapeutic avenues.  The present study aims to assess the contribution of nutrient-sensing pathway to human NSC and cognitive ageing starting from in vitro molecular and cellular findings back-translated to epidemiology and genetic data (Fig. 1). To this aim, we focus on 16 candidate genes belonging to the mTOR, sirtuin and insulin and insulin like growth factor1 (IIS) nutrient-sensing pathways.",37d3623e-c601-4a0e-bee0-05ef1e85cc18
5,introduction5," Key genes in each pathway were selected via literature searches (summarised in ref. 33) based on both previous studies confirming roles in ageing and on their role in the signalling cascade; genes spanning from receptors to transcription factors were selected to allow for a deeper understanding of potential underlying mechanisms.Fig. 1 Graphical summary of the cellular and epidemiological experiments. The ageing process was mimicked in vitro via the treatment with HU (hydroxyurea), tBHP (tert-butyl hydroperoxide) and repeated passaging of human hippocampal progenitor cells (hippocampal progenitor cells (HPC)). The hippocampal progenitor cells (HPC)s were assessed for cellular alterations via morphological and immunohistochemical analysis and for molecular alterations via qPCRs (a). We report morphological alterations reminiscent of a senescent phenotype as well as several gene expression alterations in nutrient-sensing pathway genes following in vitro ageing.",a5f833ec-b66d-4770-9dd8-c1f5fcfda0bb
6,introduction6," In parallel, epidemiological techniques were employed to assess how diet, exercise and genetics interact to affect age-related cognitive performance throughout ageing (b). Dietary measures such as Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)), Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) and daily calorie intake, as well as results from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) were employed to assess the role of lifestyle on cognition. The role of genetics was also assessed by investigating the association between polymorphisms in nutrient-sensing genes identified in (a) and cognitive performance. We demonstrate an important contribution of both lifestyle and genetics to age-dependent cognitive performance.",359349dd-9c8e-4627-b3e6-2d2a9e3a4acc
7,introduction7,"    We first assessed the effect of the ageing systemic environment on the expression of candidate genes and then selected those showing associations to NSC maintenance markers for further analysis using a multimodal in vitro model of NSC ageing (Fig. 1a). Finally, given the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors to cognitive decline, we assessed both their individual and combined effect on a hippocampus and age-dependent cognitive task in a cohort of 1638 twins (Fig. 1b). Polymorphisms in the selected candidate genes, physical activity and three dietary measures: adherence to Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)), healthy eating (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)) and daily calorie intake were thus tested for association to Paired Associates Learning (Paired Associates Learning (PAL)) performance.",ca111d45-4fa6-4ce9-ba07-76b9cc24413d
8,introduction8," We report interesting alterations in the expression levels of FOXO3A, NAMPT, PTEN and GRB10 following the in vitro models and significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABTB1 and SIRT1 with cognitive performance.

Incubation with 300 µM DAPI for 5 min at room temperature (RTP) was carried out for nuclear staining. See Table 1 for reagent details.  Image analysis: All immunostainings were quantified through the semi-automated CellInsight NXT High Content Screening (High Content Screening (HCS)) platform and Studio software (ThermoScientific) (see Table 1 for software details). This platform relies on light intensity thresholds set by the user, which identify DAPI (wavelength 386) or secondary antibody fluorescence (wavelengths 488 and 555).",b4a91901-3f73-4b20-bd76-6e9e37c2afca

Parameters were kept constant within studies but varied throughout different experimental set-ups.  Candidate gene selection: Candidate genes involved in nutrient-sensing pathways, ageing and stem cell function were selected by literature searches. Genes were selected to span various levels of nutrient-sensing signalling cascades. The selected genes were then assessed for expression within the hippocampal progenitor cells (HPC)0A07/03A cell line using existing microarray data (not shown).

In the in vitro ageing experiments, the average expression of the three housekeepers in the control condition (media-only p17) was used as reference control. Housekeeping genes were selected as those with the lowest coefficient of variation between conditions based on microarray data. Primer specificity was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Primer sequences are reported in key resources table.  Morphological analysis: Images were taken using the CellInsight platform and analysed using the ColumbusTM Image Data Storage and Analysis System version 2.5.0 (Perkin Elmer).

27,methods18," Following identification, the linear classifier option was used to train the software to identify each MAP2- or DCX-positive cell as having either an elongated or stunted morphology in an unbiased manner. The machine learning protocol involved a training phase in which a subset of images was used to train the machine to recognise the different morphological properties characterising each subclass. The software was trained on a minimum of five fields per condition. This was followed by a checking phase in which the population selection was checked manually on a subset of fields. Once the parameters were set, the software calculated the percent of cells belonging to each class across the entire plate and identified which morphological properties were used to create the classes.",849e6a87-4989-4228-98ca-033f18da2c61
28,methods19,  Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)): The digital Paired Associates Learning (PAL) cognitive task developed by Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was used (Table 1). The task was delivered on a touchscreen and consisted of eight stages of increasing difficulty. Participants are required to recall object locations on the screen. The outcome measure used was the number of errors made by the participant adjusted for trials required and stages completed. The results from the eight-pattern Paired Associates Learning (PAL) stage were used in this study as these are appropriate for use in cognitively healthy populations. Paired Associates Learning (PAL) assesses visual memory and learning.,5324c835-4da4-47d4-8b57-c22041cefe78

Though some education data were available, performance on National Adult Reading Scale (NART) (errors) was used as a proxy for education and included as a covariate in its place due to greater data availability. National Adult Reading Scale (NART) is widely used as a measure of premorbid intelligence.",c2fb02f7-40d7-4f28-ad7b-a0fff7db2666
30,methods21," Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) data were also collected by TwinsUK, results of 27 and above were used as inclusion criteria in order to exclude subjects with possible dementia.  Lifestyle factors: Average daily calorie intake, Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were calculated from food frequency questionnaires (food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)) collected following the EPIC-Norfolk guidelines. Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was constructed following the guidelines described by Guenther and colleagues with the exception of the use of the UK based database ‘Composition of Foods integrated database’ rather than an American based database35,90.  Briefly, food items are classified into ‘U.S. Department of Agriculture’ subgroups (e.g. fruit, grains, dairy, etc.) and then categorised into Healthy Eating Index (HEI) components based on their predominant attributes (e.g. further subdivided into lean and solid fat).",49a29810-4b03-4f3c-b6d6-2e5f8d778314
31,methods22," Each subgroup has a maximum possible amount of Healthy Eating Index (HEI) points that can be assigned to it; the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) data are converted to a measure of ‘nutritional component per 1000 kcal’. Based on this ratio, a certain proportion of the possible Healthy Eating Index (HEI) points for that subgroup is assigned to the participant. Out of the 12 subgroups, the first 9 are known as adequacy components that aim to quantify the amount of healthy foods consumed, the remaining three (refined grains, sodium and empty calories) were introduced to negatively weigh Healthy Eating Index (HEI) when excessive amounts of non-healthy foods are consumed. Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score can range from 0 to 100 points with the maximum achievable score indicating a diet that fulfils all health thresholds. The index was designed so that in a large enough population, 50 would be the mean Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score and 1 and 99 would be the 1st and 99th percentile.",e8d08b06-a6e6-40ce-91aa-5ddc32aaa9c5
32,methods23," Within the TwinsUK cohort we observe a mean of 60.03, a 1st percentile of 37 and a 99th percentile of 86.  Adherence to MD was evaluated as reported by ref. 91. A higher score reflects a higher intake of legumes, fruits, nuts, vegetables and olive oil and low intake of saturated lipids.  Physical activity data were collected via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)92, which aims at assessing the types of physical activity done by the participants to estimate a total physical activity measure known as MET-minutes per week. Once MET minutes were calculated participants were split into high, moderate and low physical activity following guidelines outlined on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) website (www.ipaq.ki.se).",1fb04380-497a-4f9f-8dc1-bd2b8b4ca09b
33,methods24," Data cleaning was also carried out in accordance to International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) guidelines; participants with missing answers or with unreasonably high levels of activity were removed and possible human errors when completing the questionnaires were identified. Truncation rules were also applied. Of the participants with both International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Paired Associates Learning (PAL) data, all those who declared a form of physical disability were evaluated for inclusion. All those who underwent Paired Associates Learning (PAL) before the onset of the disability, or underwent Paired Associates Learning (PAL) less than a year following the disability’s onset were excluded as their physical activity levels would not be representative of their physical activity levels at the time of Paired Associates Learning (PAL). All those with a disability of unknown duration were also excluded from analysis.",befbffa3-6825-4b3c-9f92-94c60f99bc02
34,methods25,"  When data were collected at several timepoints, only those closest to the time of Paired Associates Learning (PAL) were included in the analysis. Out of the 1567 individuals with available Paired Associates Learning (PAL) and food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) data, 437 individuals had Paired Associates Learning (PAL) and food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) data less than a year apart, 293 had a time interval of 1–3 years between the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) and Paired Associates Learning (PAL) task and the remaining 800 had a time interval greater than 3 years. Out of the 846 participants with eligible Paired Associates Learning (PAL) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) data, 473 had undergone the task and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) within a year of one another, 34 within 1–3 years and 339 underwent the task and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) more than 3 years apart.",e8265986-d288-4f5d-ae72-693911674683
35,methods26,"  Genetic data: Genotype information was obtained for 100 kb up- and downstream of the coding region of each candidate gene. Gene coordinates were selected using the UCSC Genome Reference GRCh37 (assembly date 2009). The genotyping was carried out by TwinsUK using a combination of Illumina arrays (HumanHap300, HumanHap610Q, 1M-Duo and 1.2MDuo 1 M). The data for each array were normalised separately and then pooled. A visual inspection of 100 random shared SNPs across arrays was carried out to rule out any batch effects. Samples were excluded according to the following criteria: a sample call rate <98%, heterozygosity across all SNPs ≥2 SD from the sample mean, evidence of non-European ancestry (assessed by principal component analysis with HapMap3 populations) and possibility of sample identity errors as informed by the identity by descent probabilities.",9b8c19b4-b615-48d4-926c-698937064e0f
36,methods27," The exclusion criteria included a Hardy−Weinberg p value < 10−6 (within unrelated individuals), a minor allele frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF)) of <1% and an SNP call rate of <97% (SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 5%) or <99% (for 1% ≤ minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%). Due to our limited number of participants, minor allele frequency (MAF) was restricted to 5% or more, and a minimum SNP call rate of 95% within our subset was applied. Following this last step of QC there were 4315 eligible SNPs. LD was accounted for by creating tag-SNPs with the Priority Pruner software. This software prunes SNPs by removing all those that are in LD with other SNPs in the dataset. As per convention, an SNP with an r2 > 0.8 and within 250 kb was determined to be in LD. Based on minor allele frequency (MAF), one of the SNPs in LD is retained and named a ‘tag-SNP’ while all other SNPs are pruned. Following the creation of tag-SNPs there were 482 eligible tag-SNPs.",b3322cef-c767-46b6-ae9e-229d0ee10058

Covariate selection was carried out by testing for association via correlation and t test analysis. To account for relatedness within the cohort, generalised estimating equations (GEE) were used instead of linear regressions. The R package ‘geepack’ was used for all analysis93. Each twin pair, irrespective of zygosity, formed a cluster and their relatedness was accounted for within the analysis. An exchangeable correlation structure was selected with the help of Quasi Information Criterion (Quasi Information Criterion (QIC)) and Correlation Information Criterion (Correlation Information Criterion (CIC)).

42,results0,"Nutrient-sensing pathways candidate gene expression is associated to cellular readouts To assess the role of the ageing systemic environment in a human context, we used an in vitro parabiosis model during which human NSC were treated with serum from young or old individuals.  The expression levels of 16 candidate nutrient-sensing genes showed no age-dependent variation but showed considerable variation in response to treatment with different serum samples (Supplementary Fig. 2). We next assessed whether this variation was associated to cellular readouts of stem cell maintenance. Therefore, mRNA levels of each candidate gene were tested for association to cell density to infer overall cell health and to markers of stemness, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.

Importantly, GRB10 expression was also significantly associated to both mTOR and PTEN expression (Supplementary Fig. 2QR).  Additionally, expression levels of NAMPT (r = 0.47, p = 0.012) (Fig. 2h) and UCP2 (r = 0.48, p = 0.008) (Fig. 2i), in the sirtuin pathway, showed positive associations to proliferation (KI67).

46,results4,"  Though expression levels of SIRT1, MASH, ETV6, S6K, EIF4E, 4EBP1, IRS2 and NRIP showed no correlation to cellular readouts, the associations described above support an important role for nutrient-sensing pathways in stem cell maintenance. mTOR, GRB10, FOXO3a, PTEN, IGF2R, SIRT1, NAMPT, UCP2 and ABTB1 were therefore selected for further analysis. SIRT1was included despite showing no correlation to cellular readouts, given the promising results of both its downstream target (FOXO3A) and upstream regulator (NAMPT).  Further passaging results in morphological alterations Given the heterogeneity of human serum, a more controlled model was established to further assess the role of these genes in NSC ageing. In this alternative in vitro ageing model, stress was induced by pharmacological treatment of the NSC with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP), to induce oxidative stress, and hydroxyurea (HU), to induce replication stress, combined with increased passage number, mimicking older cells.",faf6696a-8b42-4ebf-96d4-ca0337764a4a
47,results5,"  Cell count based on DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) stain was used to determine viable concentrations of tBHP and HU while markers of proliferation and differentiation were used to assure the NSC were able to proliferate and differentiate at higher passage numbers (Supplementary Fig. 3).  Following pilot experiments showing negligible differences between cells with passage numbers higher than 26 (Supplementary Fig. 4), passage 26 was selected as the ‘old’ passage number for experimental ease. Passage 17 was selected as the ‘young’ passage as it was the minimum number of passages enabling sufficient yield to carry out both cellular and molecular work.  To test whether in vitro ageing affected NSC maintenance, we assessed cellular and morphological measures following treatment with TBHP and HU and increased passage number. Though cellular readouts remained largely unaltered (Supplementary Fig.",24121bdb-b97b-456d-bd47-2d2bcc11431b
48,results6," 5) and there were no alterations in number of neuroblasts or immature neurons, there were noticeable morphological differences in these cell types.  In cultures with higher passage numbers, both DCX (neuroblasts) and MAP (immature neurons) positive cells appeared rounder than their lower passage counterparts. Machine learning was employed to classify cells into two classes, characterised by either a stunted or elongated morphology.  Two-way ANOVAs of machine learning results regarding MAP2-positive cells showed significant variation between groups and that 83% of the variation was due to passage number (F(1,8) = 41.39, p = 0.0002). There was no effect of treatment or interaction effect but post-hoc analysis revealed that in both the untreated (t(8) = 5.096, p = 0.0009) and treated groups (t(8) = 4.55, p = 0.004) (Fig.",ca9d79af-da56-40e5-a2d3-bad6772c4177

53,results11,"  Further passaging alters FOXO3A, NAMPT, PTEN and GRB10 expression Having assessed the cellular changes, we focused on the expression levels of the nine candidate genes highlighted by the in vitro parabiosis model.  Though treatment with tBHP and HU left candidate gene expression unaltered (Supplementary Fig. 6), passage number caused interesting variations. The effect of passage number on expression levels was investigated as well as the effect of combining tBHP and HU treatment with passage number (Fig. 3e–k). Following the proliferation assay, two-way ANOVAs highlighted significant variation in FOXO3A, NAMPT and GRB10 expression levels.  Analysis of FOXO3A expression showed 70% of the variation was due to passage number (F(1,8) = 20.15, p = 0.002), while there was no effect of treatment or interaction. Accordingly, post-hoc analysis revealed significant alterations in FOXO3A mRNA levels between the young and old untreated subgroups (t(8)3.23, p = 0.",6e5d5945-a93a-4c3a-bc39-b6cc6a5dd18b
54,results12,"012) and between the young and old treated subgroups (t(8) = 3.12, p = 0.014), showing that in both treated and untreated cells, higher passage number causes decreased FOXO3A expression (Fig. 3c).  NAMPT mRNA levels showed 82% of the variation between groups was due to passage (F(1,8) = 120.2, p < 0.0001), 6% due to treatment (F(1,8) = 8.73, p = 0.018) and 7% due to interaction effects (F(1,8) = 10.1, p = 0.013). Post-hoc analysis revealed young and old untreated cells were significantly different (t(8)5.50, p = 0.0006) as well as young and old treated cells (t(8)9.998, p < 0.0001) and old treated and untreated cells (t(8)4.34, p = 0.0025). Showing passage number alone causes increased NAMPT levels, that there is a summative effect of passage number and treatment, but that treatment alone does not elicit expression changes (Fig. 3f).

Post-hoc analysis showed young and old untreated cells displayed significantly different expression levels of GRB10 (t(8)6.33, p = 0.0002) as did young and old treated cells (t(8) = 4.92, p = 0.0012) (Fig. 3g). All other genes showed no mRNA level changes between groups following the proliferation assay (Supplementary Fig. 7A).  mRNA levels of the nine candidate genes were also assessed following the differentiation assay. Two-way ANOVAs showed significant variation in the gene expression of FOXO3A, PTEN, GRB10 and mTOR.  75% of variation for FOXO3A was due to passage number (F(1,8) = 26.3, p = 0.0009) while treatment and interaction showed no significant effects. Post-hoc analysis revealed young and old untreated cells displayed significant variation (t(8) = 3.35, p = 0.0095) as did young and old treated cells (t(8) = 3.84, p = 0.005).",4cc3bc79-ab00-466e-9280-edebbe566096
56,results14," Similarly to the proliferation data, increased passage number caused a decrease in FOXO3A expression (Fig. 3h).  PTEN mRNA levels showed 50% of the variation due to passage number (F(1,8) = 11.37, p = 0.0098) while treatment and interactions showed no effect on variance. Young and old treated cells displayed significantly different PTEN levels (t(8) = 3.415, p = 0.0092). This was not the case for young and old untreated cells that showed no difference in PTEN expression (t(8) = 1.354, p = 0.21). These results suggest that treatment of higher passage number cells, but not lower passage number cells, causes a decrease in PTEN levels (Fig. 3i).  Analysis of GRB10 mRNA levels showed 84% of the variance was due to passage number (F(1,8) = 47.84, p = 0.0001). Treatment and interaction showed no significant effects. GRB10 expression was significantly different between both young and old untreated cells (t(8) = 4.63, p = 0.0017) and between young and old treated cells (t(8) = 5.152, p = 0.",11427a4e-c9e2-4ba9-a75d-bc23750a5f0a
57,results15,"0009). These results match those of the proliferation assay suggesting GRB10 levels are consistently lowered during both proliferation and differentiation as a result of increased passage number (Fig. 3j).  Finally, mTOR level analysis showed significant variation between groups with 48% of variation attributable to passage number (F(1,8) = 8.30, p = 0.02) and no significant effect on variation of treatment and interaction effects. There was significant variance in mTOR expression levels between young and old treated cells (t(8) = 2.54, p = 0.035) but not between young and old untreated cells (t(8) = 1.539, p = 0.16), suggesting mTOR levels are lowered in cells with higher passage numbers (Fig. 3k). This variation, however, did not survive multiple testing correction. All other genes showed no significant variance following the differentiation assay (Supplementary Fig. 7).",3fca939b-2b0b-4ac5-9c7b-194aa218894b
58,results16,"  For all analyses involving two-way ANOVAs comparing passage number and tBHP and HU treatment effects, Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) following by Bonferroni correction was applied to account for three comparisons. All results reported as significant, except the difference in mTOR mRNA levels between young and old treated cells, survived this threshold.  Age, National Adult Reading Scale (NART) and education predict cognitive performance To assess whether the NSC maintenance-associated genes identified above play a role in cognition, we investigated the association of genetic variation within these genes to performance on a hippocampus-dependent cognitive task in a human population of 1638 twins. As performance on Paired Associates Learning (PAL) is known to be age and education dependent, we first assessed the role of age, education-level and National Adult Reading Scale (National Adult Reading Scale (NART)) errors on Paired Associates Learning (PAL).",fb90065b-3498-44a7-80a3-c0c07304d7c5

Paired Associates Learning (PAL)e was tested for correlation with education-level and National Adult Reading Scale (NART) errors. Paired Associates Learning (PAL)e showed significant negative correlation with education (Spearman’s, r = −0.29, p < 0.00001, n = 1384) (Fig. 4c). Similarly, National Adult Reading Scale (NART) errors showed a significant correlation with Paired Associates Learning (PAL)e (Pearson’s, r = 0.10, p < 0.00001, n = 1784) (Fig. 4d). As National Adult Reading Scale (NART) data were much more complete and accurate than education-level data, and both datasets showed moderate significant negative correlation (Spearman’s, r = −0.43, p < 0.00001, n = 1185) (Fig.",6531d9e6-09e9-4531-8bb0-e986ea731a49
60,results18," 4e), National Adult Reading Scale (NART) was selected as the education measure. Age and National Adult Reading Scale (NART) were thus selected as covariates for all models involving Paired Associates Learning (PAL). In addition, though gender showed no effect on Paired Associates Learning (PAL), it was included as a covariate to account for the possibility of an undetected effect owing to the limited number of male participants within our cohort (1879:226 F:M) and the varying number of participants in each model.Fig. 4 Epidemiological analysis in TwinsUK cohort shows age, National Adult Reading Scale (NART) errors and education level are predictive of cognitive performance. a Scatter plot showing the significant correlation between age and Paired Associates Learning (PAL) errors suggesting increasing age is associated to a decline in performance. b Tukey boxplot showing the non-significant association between gender and Paired Associates Learning (PAL) error (Welch’s t test).",b99ba63c-a8f2-4507-aea2-6399a3d0a748

However, there was a significant interaction between physical activity and calorie intake (β = −2.79, p = 0.009) showing different associations between calorie intake and Paired Associates Learning (PAL)e depending on the participant’s exercise level (Fig. 5g). For participants with low International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), each Log(Kcal) consumed was predictive of a 2.55 increase in Paired Associates Learning (PAL)e.",47a076cf-dc90-44ed-9773-a7fbe9ed786d

73,discussion0,"In this study, we investigated candidate nutrient-sensing genes expression in an in vitro parabiosis model and in a novel model of in vitro ageing. We tested the association between lifestyle factors and cognitive performance in a human cohort, and the role of genetic variation in these candidate genes on cognitive performance. These different approaches converge in highlighting ABTB1 and GRB10 as key genes in the interplay between NSC, ageing, lifestyle and cognition.  This study confirms the involvement of nutrient-sensing pathways in human NSC maintenance and supports their role in NSC ageing. Though the in vitro parabiosis experiments, which mimicked previously published in vivo parabiosis experiments11,18, showed no effect of serum-donor age on gene expression, they revealed interesting associations between known regulators of nutrient-sensing pathways and cellular markers.",f6507019-be1f-49a2-ae4d-de098e6b270b
74,discussion1," These results confirm the systemic environment’s ability to alter cellular function, which is of particular interest given evidence suggesting a much more permeable blood−brain barrier during ageing than initially anticipated37. Candidate genes also showed expression alterations following repeated NSC passaging in an in vitro ageing model further supporting their role in NSC ageing.  Following the in vitro parabiosis model, several components of the insulin and insulin like growth factor1 (IIS) pathway, which has been repeatedly linked to NSC regulation and longevity in rodent models, showed associations to human stem cell maintenance38–42. FOXO3A showed associations to several cellular readouts, in keeping with animal and human studies highlighting it as a key molecule in both longevity and NSC homoeostasis43,44.",50541a03-21ca-4f62-a277-4686294356cc
75,discussion2," These alterations support its involvement in human NSC ageing and, given its role in oxidative stress and DNA damage response, its decrease in higher-passage cells is indicative of poorer defence mechanisms45.  Consistent with rodent studies, we confirm a role for the mTOR pathway in NSC regulation and support associations between proposed pathway regulators like GRB10 and PTEN and central components such as mTOR46–48. Though GRB10 is known to play an important role in stem cell regulation, its role in NSCs specifically remains unclear. Given its consistently lowered expression following the ageing model, our data support an important function in NSC ageing49. Similarly, as PTEN overexpression has been linked to exceptional rodent longevity and to anti-oxidant mechanisms, lowered PTEN expression may indicate an age-associated decrease in anti-oxidant response50–52.",3ad5f822-cdca-4c5a-87f3-aae1430e5bf6
76,discussion3," Interestingly, PTEN alterations due to passage number occurred only in differentiated treated cells suggesting these are more susceptible to treatment-induced oxidative stress and replicative senescence. Given the different lengths and number of treatment-timepoints in the differentiation and proliferation assays, it remains to be elucidated whether treatment affects NSC progeny more harshly than their undifferentiated counterparts or whether the differentiation assay is more representative of chronic stress due its longer duration and repeated treatment.  The reported alterations in the sirtuin pathway are particularly interesting given its role in mitochondrial regulation and the mounting evidence linking energy metabolism alterations to ageing1. Our results align with rodent studies showing NAMPT and UCP2 ablation or deficiency lead to decreased proliferation as both showed a positive correlation to proliferation53,54.",7813d7b3-4283-4e0f-b2aa-5e7fb382c46a
77,discussion4," Though passage number and treatment showed an interesting cumulative effect on NAMPT expression, it remains to be elucidated whether this is a negative consequence or a compensatory mechanism. While it is possible that the fluctuation is unrelated to an ageing phenotype, current evidence showing NAMPT levels tend to drop in aged stem cells, suggesting this effect is likely a defence mechanism53,55. Despite interesting results relating to NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme for SIRT1-dependent deacetylation, and UCP2, a protein downstream of SIRT1, SIRT1 showed no associations to cellular readouts.  Finally, we show several associations between cellular readouts and expression of ABTB1, a protein with currently unknown cellular functions besides a probable role in ageing highlighted by Horvath’s clock56. The results presented here suggest that ABTB1 expression is involved in NSC regulation and is associated to a shift towards neuronal differentiation and away from proliferation.",6433e04a-6290-485e-aefe-6d9e744e851d
78,discussion5," To our knowledge, this is the first study linking ABTB1 to NSCs, yet this association is supported by studies showing an interaction between ABTB1 and PTEN, a key regulatory molecule of the mTOR and insulin and insulin like growth factor1 (IIS) pathway57.  Overall, passage number had a far greater effect than chemical treatment. This was surprising given increased passaging being a more likely reflection of chronological, rather than pathological, ageing and previous studies on other cell types employing tBHP and HU as stand-alone stress and ageing models58,59. The lack of consistent treatment-effect indicates either a specific resistance of hippocampal progenitor cells (HPC)s to these treatments or a lack of coping mechanism. As the cultures contained no microglia and only limited astrocytes, the lack of glial support may have caused inadequate defence mechanisms and extensive cell death. Accordingly, pilot data showed that slightly higher tBHP or HU concentrations (Supplementary Fig.",9ac512c8-4576-4329-8b9c-c5d060428ac0
79,discussion6," 3A, B) were extremely toxic. Importantly, pilot data confirming individual treatment with tBHP or HU showed no significant effects on cellular (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B) or molecular (Supplementary Fig. 6) data, eliminated the possibility that the combination of treatments masked possible alterations. Though increased passage number may be creating a selection of the most resistant cells, the resulting morphological alterations reminiscent of a senescent phenotype suggest otherwise.  Together, our results show that while the systemic environment can cause significant molecular and cellular changes, these may not be due to chronological age alone. As the systemic environment is strongly affected by lifestyle, and nutrient-sensing pathways are particularly receptive to these alterations, it is likely that the serum donors’ varying lifestyles masked age-dependent effects.",09a1d9c0-5847-4ac7-baa4-eb8b82295e63
80,discussion7," Accordingly, the alternative ageing model demonstrated age-associated variation in FOXO3A, NAMPT, PTEN and GRB10 which was not detected in the parabiosis model.  We assessed NSC maintenance in ageing models based on the hypothesis that changes in NSC regulation lead to phenotypic alterations such as altered cognitive performance. Based on abundant animal literature and the current lack of techniques to detect in vivo NSC alterations in humans, hippocampal-dependent cognitive performance is often used as a proxy for NSC health16,60. Therefore, and as our parabiosis results support a role for lifestyle in NSC maintenance, we tested the association between lifestyle and cognitive performance in a human population to assess whether in vitro associations were reflected in vivo.",9856cbfa-345f-4d1d-9c2b-d71cc588e283
81,discussion8," Our results cannot definitively add to the debate regarding the presence of adult human neurogenesis but, by showing associations of candidate genes to both NSC maintenance and cognitive performance, they are supportive of a link between NSC maintenance and cognition.  We show that several factors affect performance on the hippocampus-dependent task. The correlation between Paired Associates Learning (PAL) performance and age is supported by existing literature showing an age-dependent decline in episodic memory and by studies using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Paired Associates Learning (PAL) both within, and independently of, the TwinsUK cohort61–63. Increased education also showed significant effects on cognition but despite recent studies, it remains unclear whether this is due to cognitive reserve or a confounding effect of higher cognitive abilities increasing the likelihood of further education64–67.",5eff2999-46f2-4bb4-b0d1-0a84fed86d30
82,discussion9,"  Interestingly, while diet or exercise alone was not associated to cognitive performance, their combination was. The lack of association between calorie intake and cognitive performance contrasts with animal literature where several animal models show decreased calories extend lifespan and improve cognitive abilities68. Our results suggest that in a human population this association is confounded by varying exercise levels which are likely to be kept constant under experimental conditions. The suggested inference of our results is that appropriate calorie intake commensurate with energy expenditure is beneficial for cognition, while inappropriately high calorific intake is harmful. However, factors unmeasured in the present study, such as depression or anxiety, could explain this finding.",66b2c537-0495-4e3e-8719-7f9b3f84c153
83,discussion10," It is important to bear in mind the time difference between dietary, exercise and cognitive assessments in our cohort, which is likely to reduce power to detect associations between lifestyle and cognition but may also be contributing to confounding effects. Despite this, our data suggest the effect of lifestyle and cognition is dependent on the balance between energy intake and expenditure rather than a pre-set association.  Next, we aimed to explain the remaining interindividual variation. Despite several studies reporting associations between FOXO3A polymorphisms and longevity, we report no associations between FOXO3A and cognitive performance69. Instead, we report a significant association between rs497849 genotype, a polymorphism near the SIRT1 gene, and Paired Associates Learning (PAL) performance.",53e95a47-e9be-4520-a025-9be016829b19
84,discussion11," Though no other groups have reported direct associations of rs497849 to age-dependent cognition, SIRT1 genotypes have been linked to age and lifestyle-associated traits including cognition, carcinoma, type-2 diabetes and body mass index70–73. Importantly, rs497849 is not in the SIRT1 coding region but further downstream near the HERC4 coding region and has unknown consequences on SIRT1 regulation. Despite this, rs497849 has been previously used as a tag-SNP to investigate SIRT1 as it is in strong LD with surrounding SNPs70,72. Contrary to other studies, rs497849 was not in LD with any other SNPs possibly due to the limited number of participants causing weaker r2 values which failed to survive the LD threshold.  The association between cognitive performance and rs782431, an SNP near ABTB1, supported a role for this gene in ageing as suggested by our parabiosis data.",df4328bb-20d8-4651-aa5e-f0725cb20b00
85,discussion12," This SNP was in LD with three other SNPs (rs263021, rs2720262 and rs782455), suggesting any combination of these polymorphisms could be affecting molecular pathways relating to hippocampal cognition. rs782431 is within the MCM2 coding region, which is of particular interest given MCM2’s function as DNA replication licensing factor and its use as a marker for slowly cycling NSCs in neurogenesis studies74,75. By affecting NSC proliferation, polymorphisms like rs782431 may affect cognitive performance via neurogenesis-dependent mechanisms. Despite this, three of the five most-significantly associated SNPs were in proximity of ABTB1 supporting an important role for ABTB1 in cognition rather than coincidental proximity to the MCM2 gene.  Our study also highlights an interaction between genetics and lifestyle confirming our hypothesis that polymorphisms confer increased susceptibility to certain lifestyles.",7db38511-506f-4e28-9b42-74f9cb19d960
86,discussion13," While other studies have shown positive associations between exercise and memory performance, we showed this was only the case for individuals who were homozygous for the major allele of rs10997817 as the presence of the minor allele appeared to reverse this association26,27,76–78. Besides one study finding an association between excessive exercise and poorer mental health, no other has reported negative effects of exercise on cognitive performance26. Though assessing the effect of excessive exercise in larger cohorts would provide more information, the higher frequency of the major allele phenotype may explain why most studies find positive effects of exercise, leaving the association between the minor allele, increased exercise and poorer cognition undetected.",31a4fe1e-2acb-4268-a807-76464d85c763
87,discussion14,"  We show Mediterranean diet adherence is most beneficial for individuals homozygous for the minor allele of an SNP near GRB10 which is supported by current literature showing Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) is associated to improved cognition79–81. Importantly, as this effect was not seen with Healthy Eating Index (HEI), our results suggest the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)’s focus on anti-oxidants such as polyphenols is conferring this association. Given the role of anti-oxidants in neurogenesis, and our in vitro results showing GRB10’s association to stem cell maintenance and its expression level alterations following in vitro ageing, our data suggest GRB10 provides the molecular link between diet, nutrient-sensing pathways, NSC ageing and cognitive decline82–84.  We propose the candidate genes identified here as a starting point for further ageing studies.",bbacfe97-5e88-42e3-b4b1-44d8836d58c0
88,discussion15," Overexpression and downregulation experiments could determine whether the gene expression variations cause the morphological alterations and confirm causal relationships between pathway components. Single-cell analysis could reveal gene-expression signatures across varying morphologies and uncover more genes involved in ageing while determining whether increased passaging is creating a sub-population of resistant super-ager cells.  Though this study’s strength is the complementarity of the in vitro and epidemiological results, it has limitations. Owing to the extended timeframe of human ageing, methods such as repeated passaging and chemical treatment were employed to mimic the passing of time and model aspects of ageing rather than replicate exact physiological conditions of multi-cellular or organismal ageing. To assess the role of other cell types in ageing, it would be interesting to compare these results to other relevant human NSC lines, were they to become available.",5e8087fe-7f43-4bb3-a6ab-16d6a0c8049f
89,discussion16," Finally, a larger cohort would enable sufficient power to test for a three-way interaction between diet, exercise and genetics, while longitudinal lifestyle and cognitive data would provide further information on the cognitive decline rate of each participant and on the contribution of lifestyle and genetics to this decline.  In conclusion, through a combination of in vitro and epidemiological approaches, our data support a role for nutrient-sensing pathways in human NSC ageing and cognitive decline. We highlight a novel role for ABTB1 in NSC regulation and cognition and hypothesise a role in nutrient-sensing through the interaction with PTEN. Importantly, GRB10 and the mTOR pathway are highlighted as a likely molecular basis for the association between diet, NSC ageing and hippocampal-dependent cognitive performance.
