0,conclusion0,"The seriousness of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and the absence of a curative treatment make both the improvement in the evolution of the pathology, as well as in the prevention of its appearance, a challenge of current medicine. Consequently, taking into account the mitochondrial dysfunction in these patients and the main cause of motor neuron degeneration, it seems that a ketogenic alternative is promising since it interferes with the main pathogenic mechanisms of the disease.  In addition, it is interesting how ketogenesis can be produced, not only by following the typical ketogenic diet, but also alongside Mediterranean diet with adaptations such as food rich in MCTs, as in coconut oil, or a decrease in carbohydrates.",f1817de8-2f30-49cd-a03e-46b0f79f456f
1,conclusion1," This means there is a high source of KBs represented in a diet that, in addition, is characterized by great antioxidant properties, allowing to reduce the enormous level of inflammation derived mainly from oxidative stress evidenced at a neuronal level in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In this sense, the main nutrients and antioxidants of the diet are analyzed in this study, outlining the activity of polyphenols contained mainly in olive oil and red wine (main bastions of the diet), which through different mechanisms manage to diminish the oxidation and inflammation of these pathologies.  8 KEY FINDINGS Ketone bodies, provided through a Mediterranean diet enriched with triglyceride‐rich foods of medium chain and low carbohydrate, could be a therapeutic alternative for improving the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)).",c4856513-3dd1-4da8-be5e-7bfda3879037
2,conclusion2," These improvements are due to the neuroprotective capacity of these metabolites and the enormous antioxidant power of the Mediterranean diet due mainly to the polyphenols provided by nutrients such as olive oil, wine, nuts, or berries.  CONFLICT OF INTEREST The author declares that I do not have any conflict of interest.  ETHICAL APPROVAL This study does not involve any human or animal testing.
