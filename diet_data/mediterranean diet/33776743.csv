0,methods0," 2.1. Study Population  The Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) project is a prospective, multipurpose, and dynamic cohort of Spanish university graduates whose recruitment started in December 1999 and nowadays involves almost 23,000 Spanish college graduates. A more detailed description of the cohort design and methodology is available elsewhere [23]. Briefly, self-reported questionnaires received through postal mail or the web collected information at baseline about sociodemographic characteristics, health status, family history of diseases, and lifestyle of the participants. Every two years, information about lifestyle factors, especially eating habits and health outcomes, was updated.",ac44ab54-569c-4ec0-a9a1-64f4bd33535c
1,methods1,"  For these analyses, participants who were recently recruited and had less than 2 years and 9 months of follow-up (n = 341) were excluded, as well as those whose total energy intake was outside of predefined limits (<500 or >3500 kcal/d in females, or <800 or >4000 kcal/d in males) [24] (n = 2142) and who did not adequately answer the food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) (more than 15 items missing) (n = 2552). Additionally, participants with prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) (n = 247) and lost follow-up (n = 1465) were excluded. In total, 16,147 participants were included in this analysis, with a mean follow-up time of 11.5 years (SD = 4.5) and a retention rate of 91.7% (Figure 1).  2.2. Assessment of Dietary Intake and (Poly)Phenol Intake  A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with 136 food records was used to assess previous dietary intake and after a 10-year follow-up [25,26].",01cf13d2-77ea-4e7a-b0ec-210ac704d287
2,methods2," Each food was grouped into nine categories of consumption (never or seldom; 1–3 times/month; once a week; 2–4 times/week; 5–6 times/week; once a day; 2–3 times/day; 4–6 times/day and >6 times/day). To compute daily energy and nutrient intakes, Spanish food composition tables were used, and standard serving sizes were multiplied by the frequency of consumption of each food [27,28].  (Poly)phenol content provided by foods was obtained from the Phenol-Explorer database 3.6 version (www.phenol-explorer.eu, accessed on 1 October 2021) whose methodology is published elsewhere [29,30]. Foods with no or only traces of (poly)phenols were excluded. For the recipes and processed foods, (poly)phenol content was computed according to their ingredients.",d87d93a2-633f-4139-b6f7-2781feb22e71
3,methods3," The most common extraction method for estimating PPI was high-performance liquid chromatography (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)), which quantifies (poly)phenol glycosides, phenolic acid esters together with aglycones and free phenolic acids concurrently, and normal-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for proanthocyanidins. In the case of lignans, and phenolic acids in certain foods, such as cereals, olives, and beans, data corresponding to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after hydrolysis were used to calculate the aglycone. This analytical method uses acid or alkaline hydrolysis to release certain compounds, such as insoluble phenolic acids esterified to the cell wall of cereals, which cannot be solubilized without hydrolysis. When food items of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) included more than one food, a weighted average was used according to the average dietary intake in the adult Spanish population [31].",dd8d09ad-85dc-47a6-a5e8-2c72762020fa
4,methods4," Finally, the individual PPI of each food was obtained by multiplying the content of each (poly)phenol by the daily consumption of each food. The total PPI was determined (milligrams per day) as the sum of all the individual PPIs of every food record reported by the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). A ratio of the total or individual (poly)phenols contributed by the specific food or food group to the total (poly)phenol intake of all foods was calculated.  2.3. Outcome Assessment  The incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was the endpoint of this study, and it included myocardial infarction diagnosed using universal criteria, non-fatal stroke defined as a sudden onset focal-neurological deficit with a vascular mechanism that lasted more than 24 h, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) death [32].",0a0aa3f7-908a-43bc-af34-90595071b820
5,methods5," Clinical records or information were requested to participants or their families to confirm the event when cardiovascular disease (CVD) was self-reported in any of the biennial follow-up questionnaires. All cardiovascular disease (CVD) case information was revised and confirmed by an expert medical panel that was blind to participant diet and lifestyle exposure and classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10). cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths were confirmed through death certificates and the database of the Spanish National Statistic Institute.  2.4. Assessment of Covariates  At baseline, participants provided information about possible confounders, including socio-demographic characteristics (sex, age, level of education, and marital status), validated anthropometric measures [33] (weight and height), and health-related behavior such as alcohol intake, smoking status, leisure-time watching TV, or physical activity (METs-h/week) [34].",2449d141-e855-4317-82e6-aa4443788f1d
6,methods6," Family and personal medical history (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular disease (CVD), among others) was also reported and ascertained at baseline. Some validation studies in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort assessed the reliability of self-reported medical data [35,36].  2.5. Statistical Analysis  PPI values were adjusted for total energy according to the residual method proposed by Willett [24] and were categorized into sex-specific quintiles. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze participants’ characteristics at baseline adjusted for age and sex using the inverse probability weighting method, using proportions or means (and standard deviations, SD) according to quintiles of PPI. The main sources of total PPI, and (poly)phenol classes and subclasses intake were calculated, as well as the contribution of each food item to total (poly)phenol and subclasses intake.",e7ba1fc7-9ddb-4c2d-8181-a27adc622405
7,methods7,"  Crude and multivariable Cox regression models were used to analyze cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and PPI using age as the underlying time variable, with quintiles of total energy-adjusted PPI intake or PPI classes as the independent variable. Time at entry was defined as the date of completion of the first questionnaire, and time at exit as the date of the cardiovascular event or date at which participants filled out their last follow-up questionnaire or the date of death due to a non-cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related cause for non-cases.",13c3dbdf-3df5-478f-b6dd-895fbda778bf
8,methods8," Multivariable adjusted model 1 was stratified by age (five-year periods), recruitment period, marital status, and years of university education and adjusted for energy intake (kcal/day), smoking status (never smoker, current smoker or former smoker), lifetime tobacco exposure (packs-years), body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) (kg/m2) and the quadratic term, prevalent dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes, family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), physical activity (METs-h/week, continuous), TV watching (hours/day, continuous), use of cardiovascular drugs (yes/no), health consciousness (number of medical check-ups, quintiles), energy-adjusted alcohol (g/day) intake, and energy-adjusted (g/day) sodium intake.  Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated with their 95% confidence interval (CIs), including age as the underlying time variable and always considering the lowest quintile as the reference category.",172e252b-166b-4de7-8f5e-eb0af2fe5290
9,methods9," Repeated measurements were performed to evaluate dietary intake variation effect on those participants who completed the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) after 10-year follow-up (Q10 questionnaire) using cumulative average for dietary variables to reduce the effect of dietary intake variations at 10 years of follow-up, and the analysis was stratified and adjusted for the same confounders as in model 1. HRs in model 1 and repeated measurements were calculated excluding participants with 40 years of age or less to evaluate if the effect was restricted to subjects older than 40 years. The date on which they turn 40 years old, if applied, was used as entry in the regression model adjusted for the same confounders as the initial sample. In addition, HRs were estimated to assess the effect of a low (or suboptimal) PPI (first quintile of total PPI) versus a moderate-high intake (quintiles 2 to 5 of PPI). All analyses were repeated for each (poly)phenol subclass.",dd223792-e02e-498e-a48b-8c9b3b0738ce
10,methods10,"  Multivariable-adjusted Nelson–Aalen curves were employed to describe the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) across quintiles (Q1 vs. Q2–Q5) of total PPI to assess absolute risk along the follow-up period. To adjust these curves, inverse probability weighting methods were applied. Sensitivity analyses were performed by rerunning the same analysis, not excluding participants with incomplete food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline, and the results remained similar. The analyses were performed with the Stata statistical software package version 16 (College Station, TX, USA; Stata Corp LLC). All p-values presented are two-tailed, and the statistical significance was set at 0.05.  3. Results  The main baseline characteristics of the 16,147 participants included in the analyses according to the energy-adjusted quintiles of the baseline total PPI are shown in Table 1. The mean age of the participants was 37 years (SD = 12), and the median body mass index (BMI) was 23.",7439407b-e580-4898-80da-635e7cfc97f2
11,methods11,"5 kg/m2 (SD = 3.5).  Participants in the first quintile of total PPI showed the highest total energy intake and fat intake, while carbohydrate, protein, fiber, and alcohol intakes were the lowest for the lowest quintile. This first quintile also exhibited the lowest average level of leisure-time physical activity (MET-h/week) at baseline. Participants in the lowest quintile of PPI showed a higher use of cardiovascular drugs, hypertension, and diabetes at baseline but also the highest proportion of never smokers. Flavonoid intake was the (poly)phenol class that increased most across quintiles of total PPI. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased progressively from the first quintile to the fifth.  The energy-adjusted mean ± SD of total PPI was 779.7 ± 371.6 mg/day, of which 55.5% were flavonoids (432.8 ± 271.6 mg/day), 38.8% phenolic acids (302.9 ± 151.9 mg/day), 5% other (poly)phenols (40.5 ± 33.1), 0.28% lignans (2.2 ± 1.0 mg/day), and 0.15% stilbenes (1.2 ± 2.",69fde738-4ec0-45aa-a997-f9fd75ef0d6f
12,methods12,"6 mg/day) (Table 2). The class that contributed the most to total PPI was flavonoids, followed by phenols acids, but the highest subclass contributor to total PPI was a phenolic acids subclass, hydroxycinnamic acids (266.3 ± 140.1 mg/day, 34.15%), followed by a flavonoid subclass, proanthocyanidins (221.3 ± 198.2 mg/day, 28.38%).  Regarding (poly)phenol subclasses, the main contributor to flavonoids was proanthocyanidins (221.3 ± 198.2 mg/day) and the principal food source of flavanoids was chocolate (44.4%), apple (21%), cherries (11.1%), and strawberries (5.3%). The group of flavanones (74.6 ± 75.8 mg/day) was the second subclass contributor to flavonoids and was basically provided by oranges (33.7%), natural orange juice (27.5%), and fruit juices from concentrates (18.7%). Among phenol acids, hydroxycinnamic acids had the highest intake (66.3 ± 140.1 mg/day) with coffee (31.8%) and decaffeinated coffee (12.",60b5e8f3-0580-4255-99dc-560f424db72c
13,methods13,"7%) as the main food sources, and hydroxybenzoic acids showed lower intakes (31.6 ± 24.8 mg/day) largely provided by nuts (34%), olives (16.41%), and strawberries (13%). Olives were the main food source for hydroxyphenylacetic acids (4.44 ± 6.9 mg/day) and hydroxyphenylpropanoic acids (0.6 ± 1 mg/day). Lignan intake (2.2 ± 1.1 mg/day) was mostly provided by carrot and pumpkin (13.3%) and olive oil (11.2%), while the principal supply for stilbenes (1.2 ± 2.6 mg/day) was red wine (88.6%). Tyrosol intake (27.2 ± 29.9 mg/day) was the most abundant element within the subclass of “other (poly)phenols” with olives (66.1%) and olive oil (28.9%) as principal food contributors.  Among 185,652 person-years of follow-up, a total of 123 medically-confirmed new onset cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were observed (median follow-up 11.5 years).

14,methods14," medium–high total PPI analysis showed a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence (adjusted multivariable model 1 HRQ1 vs. Q2–Q5 2.12; 95% CI 1.27–3.57; p < 0.001) (Table 3). When analyses were restricted to participants older than 40 years, lower HRs were observed, but results did not remain significant. Once repeated measurements were applied, an increased risk remained significant (adjusted multivariable model 1 HRQ1 vs. Q2–Q5 1.85; 95% CI 1.09–3.16; p < 0.05).  When low versus medium–high flavonoid intake was analyzed, the results showed a significantly higher risk in quintile 1 of flavonoid intake in the crude model. (HRQ1 vs. Q2–Q5 1.86; 95% CI 1.20–2.87; p < 0.001), multivariable model 1 (HRQ1 vs. Q2–Q5 1.73; 95% CI 1.03–2.90; p < 0.05) and using repeated measurements (HRQ1 vs. Q2–Q5 1.88; 95% CI 1.11–3.17; p < 0.05).",f7d2cafe-503c-41cd-b5a9-dacc9f75fa37
15,methods15," Restricting the analyses to participants older than 40 years, the results remained significant, and HRs were higher in multivariable model 1 (HRQ1 vs. Q2–Q5 2.27; 95% CI 1.33–3.88; p < 0.001) and in repeated measurement analyses (HRQ1 vs. Q2–Q5 1.97; 95% CI 1.19–3.27; p < 0.001).  For lignan intake, significant results were only observed in a low intake when analyses were restricted to participants older than 40 years in multivariable model 1 (HRQ1 vs. Q2–Q5 1.83; 95% CI 1.03–3.25; p < 0.05), but it was the only class of phenolic compounds that showed a significant linear trend (p < 0.05) across quintiles in all regression models conducted. Regarding phenol acids, significant results were only observed for low intake (HRQ1 vs. Q2–Q5 1.97; 95% CI 1.12–3.45; p < 0.05) when analyses were conducted on participants older than 40 years in multivariable model 1.",569d668a-18fa-4fac-8d9f-1fef07dcdeaf
16,methods16,"  Cumulative HR for cardiovascular disease (CVD) development over time across quintiles of total PPI was graphically represented using Nelson–Aalen curves with adjustment for the same variables as model 1 but using inverse probability weighting and according to a low total PPI (first quintile, Q1) versus medium–high total PPI (Q2–Q5), which showed a higher absolute risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the lowest quintile of total PI, with diverging curves starting after 2 year follow-up (Figure 2). Sensitivity analyses were performed repeating the same analysis without excluding the 2552 participants with incomplete questionnaires (more than 15 items missing) at baseline), and the results remained similar.  4. Discussion  These results suggest that a suboptimal intake (432.1 mg/day or less) of total (poly)phenols and a low flavonoid intake (190.7 mg/day or less) are associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.",cd03b4d7-1bf0-4e35-8056-03e148945ad7
17,methods17," These findings are in line with previous analyses of PPI in a smaller subsample of the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort, with a shorter follow-up and in which repeated measurements of PPI during follow-up were not used [38]. It can now be confirmed that the cardioprotective effect persists when repeated measurements at 10 years of follow-up are performed. In addition, the natural history of the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) related to phenolic compounds could be plotted, showing changes in absolute risks over the follow-up period.  Evidence from randomized controlled trials designed to assess primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Mediterranean populations described the role of phenolic compounds in cardiovascular health and reported an inverse relationship between dietary intake of phenolic compounds and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), consistent with the results shown in this study [39,40].",85a19b7a-692e-4fa9-a439-473be6cb7a93
18,methods18," Findings also revealed a meaningful role of flavonoid subclasses in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). They could be explained by proanthocyanidins and flavonols intake, which are the main flavonoid compounds contributing to the total PPI. Some studies supported a beneficial effect of proanthocyanidin-rich foods, but they also mentioned that bioavailability of the polymerized proanthocyanidins is very limited, and the biological active compounds should be investigated in the monomeric forms of the proanthocyanidins, the catechins, and in the set of metabolic compounds generated by degradation of the proanthocyanidins in the intestine, which can be interrelated with gut microbiota activity [41,42,43,44].  A dose-response meta-analysis [45] studied the association between dietary intake of total subclasses and individual flavonoids and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It provided evidence about the potential cardiovascular benefits of a flavonol-rich diet.",84d0c2c9-721e-4243-aa26-ac0c76519bdd
19,methods19," Moreover, a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found that flavonol intake was inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in either US or European populations [46]. In addition, the results of the dose-response analysis indicated that an average increase of 10 mg/day of flavonol intake was associated with a 5% lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Possible mechanisms by which flavonols may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) probably involve more than one effect. In brief, there is solid evidence that, in vitro, quercetin, and related flavonols exert endothelium vasodilator effects, protective effects on endothelial function against oxidative stress, platelet antiaggregant effects, inhibition of low-density lipoprotein oxidation, and reduction of adhesion molecules and other inflammatory markers [47,48].",4d8fe00a-77e9-4afe-9204-572a701d3dd5
20,methods20," Moreover, evidence suggests that quercetin may be a key compound preventing the most common forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and contributing to the protective effects provided by fruits and vegetables, which is consistent with food sources of flavonols reported here in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort [49,50].  Regarding lignans, a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was found in the lowest intake quintile and a significant inverse linear trend across quintiles of intake in participants older than 40 years. Previous studies found a lower risk of total cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with a high long-term intake of lignans, although the effect may be explained by a possible synergy with fiber intake [51]. Lignans in the present study were mainly supplied by carrot and pumpkin (13.3%), which are vegetables with high concentrations of beta-carotenes.",fcb4979b-4c95-4dc0-a6ae-3c7561d7d22e
21,methods21," In this context, a review indicated that beta-carotene and its vitamin A derivatives may stimulate lipid catabolism in several tissues and may play a role in immune cells, which are related to the physiopathology of cardiovascular disease (CVD) onset [52,53]. Olive oil was the second source of lignans (11.2%), and its protective role against cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been widely studied both in Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries [7,54,55,56,57].  Phenolic acid intake, of which coffee hydroxycinnamic acids were the main source in this study, showed a significant increase of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the lowest quintile of intake in those over 40 years of age, and some evidence explained the mechanisms of endothelial protection by hydroxycinnamic acids, suggesting a potential role in prevention of thrombus formation or atherosclerotic lesion development [58].",5f1ff31a-7e33-455b-bcb3-63e3279ba351
22,methods22," Recent data from large observational studies have shown possible associations between phenolic acid intake and improvements in blood pressure and metabolic syndrome, although evidence from randomized clinical trials presents some inconsistencies due to individual variation in the diversity of the microbiota and the influence it exerts on the effective use of phenolic acids in the human body [59].  Randomized controlled trials have evaluated the role of isolated phenolic compounds in cardiovascular prevention, taken as a complement and eliminating the possible synergies that could be obtained by the contribution of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals from fruits and vegetables that are naturally present and that can be a bias when evaluating the cardioprotective effect.",dee09304-b399-4343-99b2-e35f07275d24
23,methods23," In some of them, improvements in endothelial function, metabolic syndrome components, lipid metabolism parameters, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory improvement were shown, but in contrast, another randomized controlled trial with a daily intake of 25 mg pure (-)-epicatechin for 2 weeks did not show cardiometabolic risk factor improvements outside of its food matrix [60,61,62,63]. Therefore, it appears that the action of polyphenols on human metabolism may change when ingested in isolation or in combination with the dietary components of food.  Some limitations may be observed in the present study. One of them can be related to the estimation of PPI, even though the most updated and comprehensive database available was used (Phenol-explorer version 3.6), not all foods from food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) are included in the database (e.g., honey), food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) does not cover all (poly)phenol-rich foods (e.g.",4926d008-bdf5-4326-8156-9434756025d5
24,methods24,", spices or herbs) and also does not distinguish food details that can affect the (poly)phenol content (types of tea, coffee or cocoa percentage of different varieties of chocolate) nonetheless some validation studies have shown that food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) are soundly valid for estimating (poly)phenol intake [64]. Furthermore, bioavailability after ingestion was not considered and may vary among individuals. In addition, phenolic intake can be affected by external conditions that may affect the food (poly)phenol content, such as ripeness, processing, and storage, and variety can affect the food (poly)phenol richness [12]. Fortunately for our participants, the number of events in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) project was relatively low, as expected in a relatively young and healthy Mediterranean cohort.",a72318dc-7e62-43ff-bea8-c8d17839ae97
25,methods25," Nevertheless, this fact may have limited our statistical power for assessing these associations, and the lack of significance in HR of quintiles may be due to the low number of events in this Mediterranean cohort.  This study also has several strengths, including its prospective design, comprehensive, and validated data about potential confounders, ascertainment of events by a medical panel, and a high retention rate of the cohort (92%). Additionally, dietary measurement errors were reduced by considering changes in diet at the 10-year follow-up, which enabled us to calculate the cumulative average of nutrient exposure for a better representativeness of dietary intake over time. Moreover, this study was conducted in a Mediterranean country, which may help to adequately capture the effect of high (poly)phenol content foods, such as olive oil or red wine traditionally present in the Mediterranean diet and with a high observed consumption in this population.  5.",bd2ae1f1-792b-42d4-a4f1-f4333aeaca7e
26,methods26," Conclusions  These findings support the avoidance of suboptimal PPI and the promotion of (poly)phenol-rich diets, especially flavonoid-rich dietary patterns, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Flavonoids were found most abundantly in fruits, vegetables, cocoa, and wine in our cohort. Future research, especially randomized controlled trials, should be led to control phenolics intake confounding by culinary preparations that strongly influence the bioavailability of these compounds. Further research is needed to characterize interactions with gut microbiota and with systemic tissues. ",20e88b97-e8ee-4530-87a8-87aaa13cd38f
