0,introduction0,"Leishmaniasis is the second, after malaria, devastating tropical parasitic disease exhibiting a wide range of manifestations from self-healing cutaneous lesions (cutaneous leishmaniasis, CL) to severe visceral organ damage (visceral leishmaniasis, VL). It is considered as a major global health problem as it affects 0.7–1 million people every year in 100 countries all over the world, and presents very high clinical importance as an opportunistic infection in HIV co-infection clinical cases [1]. The available therapeutic options for leishmaniasis rely on limited chemotherapeutic agents, most of which are administered by the parenteral route inducing severe side-effects, while the rates of treatment failure are high [2]. The pentavalent antimony compounds, firstly introduced in the 1940s, have been used as the first line drugs against cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis, despite the long lasting parenteral route of administration and high toxicity [2].",6ec9bf11-50bc-4678-b01a-f528ebb5e0a8
1,introduction1," Paromomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, discovered in the 1960s, with leishmanicidal activity, also administered by the parenteral route with varying efficacy in different Leishmania species [3,4]. Miltefosine is the only oral drug approved for leishmaniasis treatment since 2002 but the emergence of a relevant relapse rate possesses the ultimate use of miltefosine as an option mainly for combination therapy [5,6]. Additionally, even though its side effects are considered manageable, its teratogenic potential makes it prohibitive for administration to pregnant women [7]. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B was firstly applied in 1990, and since then it has been increasingly used against leishmaniasis. Despite its highest therapeutic index compared to all other existing anti-leishmanial drugs, its high cost makes it prohibitive in several endemic regions. Today, there is an imperative need for new drugs to confront leishmaniasis that will be effective, safe and affordable.",4ce7573f-70d3-4d53-8101-92dc678e42ca
2,introduction2,"  Traditional herbal medicines are gaining increased scientific interest and the development of new anti-leishmanial drugs based on alternative agents with pharmacological properties in the field of natural products is challenging. At the same time, a plethora of today’s drugs used for a variety of diseases are plant-derived [8]. Plants possess a large repertoire of secondary metabolites that display a wide variety of pharmacological activities and the use of such medicinal plants as an innovative approach for various diseases treatment is reinforced. Olea europaea L. (Oleaceae) is the most significant plant in the Mediterranean area since its products are the benchmark of “Mediterranean diet” that has a profound positive influence on health outcomes and increased lifespan [9]. The biological properties of secondary metabolites found in Olea europaea L. have been studied previously and numerous biological activities have been defined [10,11].",61d74880-ff26-4825-959d-a8b1dbb3531d
3,introduction3," Virgin olive oil (Virgin olive oil (VOO)) contains approximately 36 phenolic compounds that attract major scientific interest due to their biological properties such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, neuroprotective and anti-cancer effects [12]. Thus, Olea europaea L. natural products display a promising role as drug candidates against leishmaniasis.  We have previously reported that three major Virgin olive oil (VOO) phenolic compounds, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, demonstrate anti-leishmanial activity in in vitro and in vivo assays [13]. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that the Total Phenolic Fraction (Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF)) derived from Extra Virgin olive oil (VOO) (Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVirgin olive oil (VOO))), a crude extract enriched in the phenolic compounds hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, has been found to exert anti-leishmanial and immunomodulatory activities in in vitro and in vivo systems [14].",dc8fd97b-0893-4a18-9614-76c84a9351f1
4,introduction4, These findings indicate that Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) can be a promising anti-leishmanial compound since ideal antiparasitic compounds should exert both antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties to provoke the simultaneous inhibition of parasite growth as well as the induction of an effective cell-mediated immune response.  Programmed cell death possesses a functional role in the biology of unicellular Trypanosomatid protozoan parasites like Leishmania [15]. The existence and identification of programmed cell death pathways in these organisms is critical for parasite biology and parasite-host interactions and could serve as a basis for developing new anti-parasitic drugs that take advantage of these pathways [16]. Induction of programmed cell death in Leishmania spp. promastigotes and intervention in the normal cell cycle sequence are some mechanisms that have been previously reported to contribute to anti-leishmanial effects of various medicinal plants [17].,8fe4f4ab-5add-41d9-a02a-506080e64d5a
5,introduction5,"  The present study was undertaken in order to delineate the actual mechanism of action of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) that contributes to its leishmanicidal activity. Thus, we determined: (a) the type of cell death initiated in Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF)-treated Leishmania spp. promastigotes, (b) the effect in cell cycle and its outcome at parasite’s cellular morphology, and (c) the efficacy of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) treatment to promote protective type of host’s immune response in a murine experimental model of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Understanding the key features of the parasitic type of cell death and the evolution of adaptive immunity to L. major is essential in developing effective strategies to control leishmaniasis based on medicinal plant products capable to exert pharmacological and immunomodulatory properties.

It is a very poorly executed study, the data is represented very poorly and cannot be considered for any scientific journal. The starting sentence of ‘Leishmaniasis being a disease unreliable chemotherapy’ is an incorrect statement.   1. The assessment of promastigote growth by differential counting of dead and live promastigotes by using the Trypan blue exclusion dye is a very crude and inaccurate approach. In view of the CFSE staining method available, this Trypan blue approach is redundant.   2. Line 210: Please state the incubation periods  3.",3f5fbce1-8878-4645-b9a5-c700c5283128
13,results4," A major problem in all assays is that it is stated that the concentration of the extract selected for this study is the IC50 and 2X1C50, and therefore the results section should begin with a viability assay that calculates this value. No where could I find a numerical value for the IC50 which is a major drawback.   4. How was the cell size determined by Flow Cytometry? A reference is needed of this methodology. Composite results is not provided, only a representative profile.  5. In Fig. 2A and 2B, why is there no cell growth, cells appear to be in stationary phase. However, all experiments pertaining to cell growth should always be performed with log phase cells. If an IC50 conc. Decreases cell viability to 57%, it is expected that with 2X IC50, there should be a sharper fall in cell viability, or is the drug cytostatic?  6.

23,discussion0,"During the last decade, the interest in the quest for natural products which concomitantly exert chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory properties, has been reinforced, due to the occurrence of numerous adverse effects of the existing drugs [47]. We have previously demonstrated the in vitro anti-leishmanial properties of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) derived from Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVirgin olive oil (VOO)), against both Leishmania developmental stages, the cell-free promastigotes and the intracellular amastigotes, as well as its ability to modulate the host’s immune system by mediating the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO in Leishmania-infected J774A.1 macrophages [14]. We have also validated its therapeutic potency in an in vivo murine experimental model of cutaneous leishmaniasis since Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF)-treated mice exhibited significant reduction of footpad swelling [14].",11c39ef2-b621-4d3b-b30c-9ae484e68e9b
24,discussion1," These results prompted us to further establish its anti-promastigote activity against both viscerotropic and dermotropic Leishmania strains and to delineate the relevant cell death mechanism by which Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) induces its anti-leishmanial potency. To our knowledge no similar study on Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF), an essential component of olive oil, has been reported before.  The anti-leishmanial activity of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) was tested against L. infantum and L. major promastigotes. Their viability after treatment with various increasing concentrations of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) was evaluated using the resazurin reduction assay based on the ability of resazurin (oxidized blue form) to be irreversibly reduced by enzymes in viable cells and to generate a red fluorescent resorufin product while a reduction in the number of metabolically active cells indicates a decrease in cell viability.",2206c961-e13f-41ea-839d-23897e3c1a6a
25,discussion2," Next, the anti-leishmanial effect of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) on L. infantum and L. major parasites was further validated in early exponential-phase promastigote cultures by cell counting and flow cytometric approaches, over a time course of up to 72 h. The rapid and precise determination of proliferation rates and generation times by CFSE staining is beneficial for the analysis of the effects of anti-leishmanial compounds [48]. Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) proved to be effective on both viability and proliferation of L. infantum and L. major promastigotes. Obtained results indicated a clear inhibition of promastigote multiplication rate and a decelerated fluorescence decrease in Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF)-treated, compared to untreated parasites. An almost stable fluorescence intensity during the days of treatment, suggested an almost completely arrested cell proliferation.",ef468801-822b-4cd2-be8f-96fdc952321e
26,discussion3," Similar studies have reported the use of these approaches for the determination of the multiplication rate of Leishmania parasites after exposure to amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug used for the symptomatic treatment of chronic Chagas’ disease patients with cardiac compromise, and allopurinol, a purine analogue used to decrease high blood uric acid levels but also to treat canine leishmaniasis [49,50]. We also evaluated alterations in cell shape and size of promastigote forms, after treatment with Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF). The round or ovoid shaped parasites exhibiting higher fluorescence intensity were assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The observed morphological changes were similar to alterations induced by other natural products. L. donovani promastigotes shrank and became aflagellated and oval or round, after exposure to racemoside A, a natural steroidal saponin [51] and HePC [38].",88adbb48-162d-4c26-a121-8302ddc1931e
27,discussion4," Also, it has been reported that yangambin, a lignan obtained from Ocotea duckei, altered the morphology of L. chagasi and L. amazonensis promastigotes in the same way [52], while another study for the trigger of apoptosis by essential oils from plants of the genus Artemisia reported shrinkage of L. infantum promastigote bodies [53].  Moreover, in the present study, we offer detailed insights into the mechanism of action of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) by evaluating basic biochemical features associated with apoptosis. Analysis of DNA content reveals cell ploidy and provides information on cell position in the cell cycle, allowing the estimation of frequency of apoptotic cells that are characterized by fractional DNA content [54]. Apoptotic cells generally feature active endonucleases that preferentially cleave DNA, translating into an increased cell population located proximal to the G0-G1 peak, often being defined as “sub-G0/G1” cell population [55].",7f3b9441-73de-4053-981d-c1dcd7ac906e
28,discussion5," We demonstrated here for the first time to our best knowledge, that Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) is able to induce sub-G0/G1 cell cycle arrest of Leishmania spp. promastigotes. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that both exponential-phase L. infantum and L. major promastigotes enter into the sub-G0/G1 stage and get arrested therein, as indicated by the increased percentages of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF)-treated promastigotes in the sub-G0/G1 region and the following decrease in G1 region. This phenomenon was observed even at 24 h of exposure, in both Leishmania species tested. The Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) treatment proved to be more potent to halt the cell cycle in the sub-G0/G1 phase compared to the effect of HePC. The oral drug HePC has been previously published to cause sub-G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in L. donovani promastigotes [38] and the fact that Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) acts more effectively to the same direction, may be promising.",0c9119fc-e754-4b17-b824-62d1c01afd69
29,discussion6," Similarly, the cell cycle arrest in the sub-G0/G1 phase has been also observed, in other studies with natural products. The established anti-malarial artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Artemisia annua, as well as, extracts of Artemisia annua leaves and seeds, have been reported to cause cell cycle arrest in L. donovani parasites [37,56]. Similarly, plant extracts obtained from Allium sativum and Valeriana wallichii also induced enhanced proportion of Leishmania spp. parasites in the sub-G0/G1 phase [57,58]. Additionally, Kalsome TM10, a liposomal amphotericin B, induced a dose- and time-dependent arrest of L. donovani promastigotes, in the sub-G0/G1 phase [59].  Two main plasma membrane alterations have been described during cell death processes, the PS externalization and the permeabilization to PI.",f40b331c-19c0-48c6-8a1b-c85accd7b76e
30,discussion7," PS is predominantly located in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, whereas, upon initiation of apoptosis, it is translocated to the extracellular membrane leaflet where it identifies cells as targets for phagocytosis [60,61]. At the early event of apoptosis, the plasma membrane still excludes viability assays such as PI, so single staining with annexin V serves as an early marker of apoptosis, while in the late stage of apoptosis, the membrane loses its integrity and the late apoptotic/secondary apoptotic cells, become positive for both annexin V and PI [55,62]. Consequently, the absence of PI staining signals membrane integrity while necrotic cells become PI-permeable even though they remain negative to annexin V. However, it should be acknowledged that the exposure of PS in Leishmania promastigotes as a marker of apoptosis-like cell death is still a controversial subject [63].",a3200f0b-4afc-47ef-af27-36faa2c990db
31,discussion8," Research models based on the detection of PS exposure suggest that Leishmania parasites mimic mammalian apoptotic cells by exposing PS at their cell surface to trigger phagocytic uptake into host macrophages [64–67]. Nevertheless, annexin V is not specific for PS and also binds other phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphophate [68]. Previous studies on Leishmania lipid compositions by chromatography-based methods have reported the presence of PS in several Leishmania species [69–71], while other studies based on mass spectrometry analysis failed to detect this lipid [72–75]. Taking into consideration that some authors affirm that primary necrotic cells with intensely damaged membranes are stained rapidly and strongly with PI but not with annexin V, our results suggest that Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) induced Leishmania spp.",43566255-33d6-47b3-8dc5-a1e1405e92cc
32,discussion9," cell death by apoptosis, as was indicated by high exposure of annexin V binding phospholipids on the surface of the parasites. Treatment of L. infantum promastigotes with Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF), exhibited a gradual increase in percentages of late apoptotic cells, indicating that when increasing drug exposure time, parasites undergo into the late phase of apoptosis. Accordingly, treatment of L. major promastigotes with Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) at all three time-points, also showed a significant increase in the percentages of annexin V positive cells. Previous studies have highlighted PS exposure after treatment with several anti-leishmanial drugs. Artemisia annua leaf essential oil enhanced mainly the proportions of single stained with annexin V late-log phase L. donovani promastigotes [76], while the apoptosis-like death induced in L.",609be9dd-ff54-4428-ba60-4291d90b71a5
33,discussion10," donovani promastigotes by Ereactive oxygen species (ROS)A, an eugenol-rich oil derived from Syzygium aromaticum, was characterized by both annexin V and PI binding [55].  Mitochondria take part in a number of fundamental cellular processes, including energy production, biosynthetic pathways and cellular oxidoreductive homeostasis while their dysfunction can lead to numerous pathophysiological consequences [77]. It has been demonstrated that nuclear features of apoptosis in unicellular protozoan cells, as in metazoan cells, is characterized by condensation of nuclei and fragmentation of DNA, that are preceded by alterations in mitochondrial structure and transmembrane potential [27]. Leishmania spp. possess a single mitochondrion that responds to energy requirements and consequently it represents a potential drug target [78]. The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential has been observed to play key role in drug-induced death in protozoans such as Leishmania spp. [79].",43d132bf-10c1-4884-848f-ba73a90eedda
34,discussion11," Thus, we tested the effect of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) on possible alterations in mitochondrial transmembrane potential of Leishmania spp. promastigotes and our data provided evidence that Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) induced a remarkable decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential within 24 h of treatment, as was reflected by a drastic fall in the red/green fluorescence intensity ratio.  Thus, while mitochondrial depolarization is critical, it is the subsequent elevation in the levels of oxidizing species generated from the mitochondria that plays the role of cytotoxic effectors in apoptosis [80,81]. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the very important potential reactive oxygen species (ROS) pool, sealed in the double membranes of mitochondria.",fc8f2600-aa21-4ae2-9919-7eca17d24615
35,discussion12," In Leishmania parasites, there is a basal level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) maintained by the mitochondria inside the cells for physiological signaling, while the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction causes leakage in the electron transport chain and thus elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels [82,83]. We found that Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) treatment promoted cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in a dose- and time- dependent manner in both L. infantum and L. major promastigotes. Several similar studies suggest an increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, being responsible for the apoptotic process in Leishmania spp., triggered by various natural products. For example, LQB-118, an orally active pterocarpanquinone and an eugenol-rich oil of Syzygium aromaticum triggered the induction of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in L. amazonensis and L. donovani promastigotes, respectively [55,84].",a4c31393-d822-4cad-a56a-b5c5e92174b7
36,discussion13,"  Taken together, reduction of proliferation rate, morphological alterations, cell population arrest at sub-G0/G1 region, PS exposure, alterations in mitochondrial potential and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, all hallmarks of classic apoptosis, indicate an apoptotic-like cell death in L. infantum and L. major promastigotes caused by Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF).  The in vitro obtained data prompted us to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) in an experimental model of cutaneous leishmaniasis in BALB/c mice. As mentioned above, we had previously demonstrated the therapeutic effect of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) against L. major-infected BALB/c mice as indicated by a significant reduction of footpad swelling during the course of infection [14].",dd7d71e8-50ba-4ecc-b113-ad60e721a565
37,discussion14," The observed lesions in Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF)-treated mice were diminished compared to the control group of infected and untreated mice which reached profound skin lesions and even necrosis. In the present study, this therapeutic effect was further verified and linked to significant reduction of parasite load in the draining lymph nodes at the site of infection. Indeed, the therapeutic treatment with Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) that considerably minimized the parasite burden was based on the half number of injections compared to the reference drug, since Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) was administered every two days, whereas HePC was administered daily. So far, the majority of the chemotherapeutic treatments against leishmaniasis used for decades are long lasting, either by oral administration, as HePC or by parenteral administration, as meglumine antimoniate [2].",86de0380-fdad-4cf4-8228-b03b6baf84f1
38,discussion15," The weight of all Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF)-treated mice remained stable during the experimental process indicating indirectly both the non-toxicity of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF), as well as the sustained homeostasis over the controlled parasitic infection. Our results are in accordance with a plethora of other studies which report effective decrease in parasite load upon treatment with natural products either in cutaneous [85–87] or in visceral leishmaniasis experimental mouse models [13,88–90].  Leishmaniasis is an immune-mediated disease and thus the concomitant potentiation of Th1 cell activation through the use of immunomodulators in addition to conventional chemotherapy has been hypothesized as a future therapeutic option for the disease [91]. The murine model of L. major infection was originally used to define the Th1/Th2 T-cell polarization and revealed the importance of the Th1/Th2 balance in favor to the Th1-type response for the successful control over the infection.",677a8206-a86a-42d5-ace0-0b07941c1f0f
39,discussion16," In order to achieve disease resolution, favoritism over the Th1 immune response must be selectively triggered by therapeutic schemes and/or compounds capable to serve as immunomodulators [92]. Therefore, focusing over the immunomodulatory properties of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF), the critical issue was to assess its potential to modulate the immune response of L. major-infected BALB/c mice towards the establishment of Th1-type immune response capable to restrain the parasite expansion. Firstly, the in vivo immunomodulatory effects of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) were probed in terms of decreased levels of Th2-type immune response as depicted in lower Leishmania-specific IgG1 antibody titer in Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF)-treated mice compared to infected and untreated controls.",40822615-f638-4368-be88-a41b74587ea3
40,discussion17," Given the observed relationship between the levels of IgG1 and IgG2a antibody isotypes with a bias towards the non-protective Th2 and the healing Th1 responses, respectively [93,94], the highest IgG2a/IgG1 ratio observed in Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF)-treated mice, suggests that Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) is able to direct the driven by Leishmania infection, Th2-type immune response to the protective Th1-type. Moreover, Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) affects markers of the host Th1-type response, as evidenced by the enhanced IFN-γ producing CD4+ T cell population at five weeks post-treatment termination. The activation of such effector cells that produce the IFN-γ macrophage-activating cytokine is necessary for the effective host control over parasite replication. A similar study demonstrated that treatment of L. donovani-infected BALB/c mice with Croton caudatus leaf extract also induced enhanced population of IFN-γ producing CD4+ T cells in splenocytes of treated mice [95].",db595e14-db78-49ad-b79d-fd6065e5dbf5
41,discussion18," Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effect of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) treatment on the Th1/Th2 differentiation was further appraised in the transcription levels of Tbx21 and GATA-3 transcription factors. Tbx21/GATA-3 ratio has been demonstrated as a surrogate marker of Th1/Th2 cytokine balance [46] and our data revealed that Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) treatment significantly enhanced this transcript ratio in spleen cells compared with infected and untreated controls, also reflecting the predominance of a Th1-type immune response. Several other extracts from different plants, display a wide variety of pharmacological activities, which may not only be due to their direct leishmanicidal action on the parasite, but also to their concomitant effect on enhancing the host’s protective immune response.",6a5a98b2-22f6-45ba-82b3-83498118968a
42,discussion19," Similar studies in in vitro and in vivo experimental models of visceral leishmaniasis have reported the ability of Xylopia discreta extract [96], and ethyl acetate extract fraction from Azadirachta indica [97] to influence the host immunity through the stimulation of Th1-type immune response.  Overall, these findings establish that Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) exhibits anti-leishmanial activity which is not only due to its direct action on the parasite but also to a simultaneous effect on the host immune response by inducing distinct T cell subpopulations that affect immunoregulation in favor to host protection. Additionally, our results contribute to the research for the promising impact of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVirgin olive oil (VOO)) on human health while also validate our previous findings for the potential use of olive tree natural products as candidate drugs against leishmaniasis in terms of being affordable and safe.
