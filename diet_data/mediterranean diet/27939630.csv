0,introduction0,"In the last decades, numerous studies have reported many relations between nutrition and health. Dietary habits, such as the Mediterranean diet, can be involved in the regulation of blood pressure, decrease of oxidative stress, improvement of lipid profile and reduction of mortality rates due to cardiovascular diseases (Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2009[23]). Olea europaea L. is among the intensively studied plants, which is highly represented in the Mediterranean diet.   So far, different experimental models have been used with the intention to investigate the hypotensive effect of Olea europaea L. leaf extract (Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)). For instance, oral administration of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) showed a dose-dependent prophylactic effect against the rise in blood pressure induced by L-NAME (Khayyal et al., 2002[18]).",dab63f70-ac79-4809-86ac-f97428968601
1,introduction1," Besides, commercial Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in systolic left ventricular pressure and heart rate on isolated rabbit hearts (Scheffler et al., 2008[36]). Information is also available regarding its activity on experimental models of genetic induced hypertension after chronic oral administration (Romero et al., 2016[34]). The dual effect of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) in both reducing blood pressure and improving lipid profile was presented as the result of the clinical trials (Perrinjaquet-Moccetti et al., 2008[32]; Susalit et al., 2011[40]). In one word, cardioprotective properties of olive leaf extract are reflected in its ability to reduce blood pressure, exert an antiarrhythmic effect, and preserve coronary blood flow. These properties were exercised probably due to different mechanisms such as the blockade of beta receptors (Somova et al.",31e5d661-ff3f-4fc4-9ca5-ff4216c0b8f0
2,introduction2,", 2004[37]), angiotensin-converting enzyme (angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)) inhibition, Ca2+ antagonism (Susalit et al., 2011[40]), as well as vasodilatory NO pathways (Miloradović et al., 2013[27]).  Haemodynamic alterations in carotid and renal arteries are associated with the severity of target organ (brain, kidney, heart) damage in patients with hypertension, and Ohta et al. (2008[29]) showed positive correlation between carotid vascular resistance and renal vascular resistance, indicating that an increase in vascular resistance in those vascular beds may develop in parallel. On the other hand, oxidative stress plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders, and reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) concentration had been shown to be increased in human carotid arteries of older patients, as a consequence of excessive production of superoxide ions by NADPH oxidase (Lucas et al., 2016[22]).",6d1a22ea-8ed7-4b4a-a1de-8929a51e2303
3,introduction3," Several animal studies have also provided an evidence for increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the vascular tissue of hypertensive rats, contributing to the generation and maintenance of hypertension (Vaziri et al., 2002[41]). Recently, we have reported significant beneficial effect of different polyphenol-reach plant products on hypertension-induced alterations of the carotid, but not renal artery haemodynamics (Mihailovic-Stanojevic et al., 2016[25][26]), although these effects were accompanied by a significant reduction of blood pressure and systemic oxidative stress. However, to our knowledge, there is no information available on the effects of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) or its main constituent, oleuropein (OP) on haemodynamics of these two different vascular beds. Olive oils have been shown to be rich in polyphenols and unsaturated fatty acids that are responsible for the enormous antioxidative capacity of this plant (Ferrara et al.",fb0fb165-fdaa-4a23-9f21-8ba974eb5fb2
4,introduction4,", 2000[13]; Krzeminski et al., 2003[20]; Žaneti and Gugi, 2006[42]). In addition, antioxidant properties of the Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) that lead to reduction of lipid peroxide accumulation in blood and other target organs, have been attributed to the high content of OP and its derivative hydroxytyrosol (Alirezaei et al., 2012[1]; Suanarunsawat et al., 2011[38]). Beside their antioxidative potential, these compounds showed antihypertensive and hypocholesterolemic properties and they have been effective in lowering triglycerides as well.   The first aim of the present study was to evaluate the reducing activity, antioxidant capacity and metal chelating ability of standardized, OP-rich Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE). The second goal was to evaluate the existence of its dose-dependent influence on systemic and regional haemodynamics, as well as the mechanism of antihypertensive action in spontaneously hypertensive rats (spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR)).",1f75005b-b0df-4f95-b1ff-9ce6f06d9a29
5,introduction5," Lipid profile and lipid peroxidation were also investigated in this experimental model of essential hypertension. In addition, we compared the observed effects with those caused by OP alone.   ",6fd1d03e-bff3-4b94-a41a-8dba1582ac4f
6,methods0,"Chemicals Olive leaf extract EFLA® 943, standardized to 16-24 % of OP, was purchased from Frutarom Switzerland Ltd. (Wadenswil, Switzerland). The extract was manufactured from the dried leaves of Olea europaea L., applying an ethanol (80 % m/m) extraction procedure. The crude extract was dried after a patented filtration process (EFLA® Hyperpure). Oleuropein content, stability and microbiological purity were confirmed by the manufacturer. According to the Certificate of Analysis provided by Frutarom, the batch used in our experiment contained 17 % m/m of OP and 40.5 % m/m of total polyphenols. Residual solvent ethanol was 0.1 % m/m only. Oleuropein (purity ≥ 90 %) was obtained from Extrasynthese (Geney, France). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., USA, unless otherwise stated.",20b9efda-7981-4acb-962a-357dcb15d085
7,methods1,"  Ferric reducing antioxidant power of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) The antioxidant potential of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) was determined using ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP)) (Benzie and Strain, 1996[4]). It is based on the change in absorbance at 593 nm as a result of the reduction of ferric to ferrous ion and consequent formation of a Fe(II)-tripyridyl triazine.   Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) Another method used for determination of antioxidant capacity of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) was Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay (TEAC)). This assay is based on the ability of antioxidants to reduce the ABTS• +, a stable radical, formed in the reaction of ABTS (2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiozoline-6-sulfonic acid)) and potassium persulfate (Krishnaiah et al., 2011[19]).",8056a87a-aad7-4abf-b376-7a3ab437b745
8,methods2," This reduction results in a decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. The assay was done according to a previously described method (Re et al., 1999[33]).   Metal chelating ability of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) Metal chelating ability was determined using a method based on a decrease in absorbance of Fe(II)-ferrozine complex (Dinis et al., 1994[9]). This method was done with slight modifications. 450 μL of 1.5 mM FeCl2 and 1.8 mL of 385 μM ferrozine were added to 50 μL of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) solution. The mixture was vigorously vortexed and after 10 min, the absorbance was measured at 562 nm. All measurements were performed in triplicate. EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), a potent Fe2+ ion chelator, was used as positive control. The result was expressed as an EC value (mg/mL, the half maximal effective concentration of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) or EDTA).",55dc3e6a-1af3-448b-a359-11c0f7df1af3

L 358/1-358/6, 18, December 1986) and Directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, 22.9.2010.).  We used 24 weeks old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR)), weighing about 300 g, which were bred at the Institute for Medical Research, University of Belgrade, Serbia.",eedc9590-ee9e-4670-9550-1fa58784f45c
10,methods4," The rats were housed 4 in a cage under constant environmental conditions (20-24 °C; 12 h light-dark cycle), and fed ad libitum with a standard chow for laboratory rats (Veterinarski zavod, Subotica, Serbia).  For the evaluation of dose-dependent effects of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) on systemic haemodynamic parameters before and after treatment, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were randomly divided into three groups: Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)5 (n=7), Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)25 (n=7), Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)50 (n=7) which received bolus of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg b.w., dissolved in 0.2 ml saline. The highest dose of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) used in this experiment (50 mg/kg) was the same, the highest dose used previously in the study in which Zarzuelo et al.",1c822ac2-830a-4ef4-bd3b-e671630b9023
11,methods5," (1991[43]) were found that the decoction of olive leaves showed spasmolytic activity against phenylephrine-induced contractions in isolated rat aorta (Zarzuelo et al., 1991[43]). The investigated dose of OP, 10 mg/kg (dissolved in 0.2 ml saline, group OP10, n=7) corresponded to its content in Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)50 (app 20 % m/m). The control spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) group received 0.2 ml saline (n=7).   Before surgical procedure, all rats were weighed and anesthetized with 35 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital.   Systemic haemodynamic measurements  Systemic haemodynamic parameters were measured in anesthetized rats by a direct method. A femoral artery was catheterized with polyethylene tubing (PE-50, Clay-Adams Parsippany, NY, USA), and connected to a physiological data acquisition system (9800TCR Cardiomax III-TCR, Columbus, OH, USA). A jugular vein was cannulated with PE-50 for the injection of cold saline.",16eb1b23-ffe8-4c24-a0af-d41b4bfd527f
12,methods6," The left carotid artery was catheterized with PE-50 tubing and attached to a thermo sensor, which was coupled to the Cardiomax III for the determination of cardiac output (CO). The other end of the thermocouple was placed in cold saline. Following 20 min for stabilization after surgery, cold saline (0.2 ml) was supplied through the jugular vein and systolic pressure (systolic pressure (SAP)), diastolic (diastolic (DAP)), mean arterial pressure (mean arterial pressure (MAP)), heart rate (HR), and CO were recorded before and after saline, Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) or OP treatment. Total peripheral vascular resistance (Total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR)) was calculated from mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CO and expressed as mmHg x min x kg/ml. Pulse pressure (PP) is calculated as the difference between the systolic and diastolic arterial pressure readings and it is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).",d8d45719-71b1-4440-8a3e-249c5575deff
13,methods7,"  Regional haemodynamic measurements For the carotid blood flow (carotid blood flow (CBF)) measurement, the left carotid artery was gently separated. An ultrasonic flow probe (1RB, internal diameter = 1 mm) was placed around the artery and carotid blood flow (CBF) had been registered using a Transonic T106 Small Animal Flowmeter (Transonic System Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA). After abdominal incision, left renal artery preparation was utilized and renal blood flow (renal blood flow (RBF)) was recorded. Vascular resistance in these two vascular beds - carotid and renal arteries (CVR and RVR) was calculated by dividing mean arterial pressure (MAP) with total blood flow through a respective blood vessel, normalized for the body weight and expressed as mmHg x min x kg/ml.",3f18f5b7-643b-4acc-939d-e33098a7c013

Plasma samples were stored on -20 °C until assayed for lipid peroxidation and lipid profile.  Lipid peroxidation In order to determine the effects of different Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) doses, as well as OP on the degree of oxidative stress in the circulation, plasma lipid peroxide levels were estimated by assaying thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)) at 540 nm using 2-thiobarbituric acid (2,6-dihydrooxypyrimidine-2-thiol; TBA, Acros, Organic). An extinction coefficient of 156000 M-1 cm-1 was used for calculation (Ohkawa et al., 1979[28]).",82325527-962c-4d8f-b0ca-5c2c9dc479d5
15,methods9," To evaluate the rate of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) released in vascular beds of interest, carotid and renal arteries, plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values were normalized to respective blood flows (carotid blood flow (CBF) and renal blood flow (RBF)) and expressed as nmol/min/ kg b.w.  Lipid profile determination Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (high density lipoproteins (HDL)-C) and triglyceride levels in plasma were measured using an automatic COBAS INTEGRA 400 plus (Hoffmann-La Roche, Germany) analyzer.

For statistical analysis of other parameters one-way analysis of variance (analysis of other parameters one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) was applied.

Pulse pressure was significantly lower only after treatment with a high dose (50 mg/kg) of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) (Figure 1C(Fig. 1)).",c933d7b3-e762-4a11-b319-8cc3eb2ddbdf
19,results2," In Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)50 group, HR and CO were also significantly decreased compared to the initial values (Figure 2B, 2C(Fig. 2)), while in Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)25 group significant reduction of Total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR) was noticed (Figure 2D(Fig. 2)). We further examined the contribution of OP to the Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)50-induced changes of systemic haemodynamic parameters (Figure 3(Fig. 3)) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP), HR and CO values that have been obtained in Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)50, were absent in OP10 group (Figure 3A, 3B, 3C(Fig. 3)) while there were no differences among Total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR) values (Figure 3D(Fig. 3)).  Treatment with 5 mg/kg of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) slightly improved carotid blood flow (CBF) (Figure 4A(Fig. 4), p=0.",0f23f333-a9c8-4b4b-8489-7e1059947108

The dose of 25 mg/kg of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) significantly reduced CVR (p < 0.05), too. Comparison between Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) treated groups show that Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)5 significantly elevates carotid blood flow (CBF) in relation to Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)25 and Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)50 (p < 0.05, and p < 0.001). An analysis of the effects of OP10 in relation to Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)50 and control (Figure 4B, 4D(Fig. 4)) has shown that there was no significant difference in carotid blood flow (CBF) or CVR between these groups, although the decrease of carotid blood flow (CBF) in Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)50 was numerically, but not statistically different in respect to both, the control and OP10 groups (Figure 4B(Fig. 4), p=0.09).",2c4ee6a2-c581-4591-9d09-db091c9b400f

25,discussion0,"In this study, we showed that Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) has a higher antioxidative capacity than BHT, and higher reducing ability than vitamin C, a potent natural antioxidant. These data were in accordance with previously determined radical scavenging activity of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) (Čabarkapa et al., 2017[7]), using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH·). Namely, the values for the effective concentration (50 % inhibition) that they obtained indicate a moderate antioxidant capacity of the extract (Čabarkapa et al., 2017[7]). Furthermore, if we compare the Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) ability to chelate metal ions with chelation capacity of other evaluated natural extracts (Bourgou et al., 2008[5]; Ebrahimzadeh et al., 2008[10]; Liu et al., 2008[21]), we assume that this extract can prevent vascular oxidative stress caused by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thus reduce the cardiovascular risks in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).",581728d0-4c70-4f27-b744-24fcea2ea15f
26,discussion1," In addition, this effect is probably coming from OP (the most abundant phenolic compound in Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)), because of its ability to chelate metal ions, such as Cu and Fe, which catalyze free radical generation reactions (Omar, 2010[30]; Suchal et al., 2016[39]).  In the second part of the study, we showed the existence of two different mechanisms of the antihypertensive response to Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) dependent on the dose that was applied. Namely, when spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was administered with 25 mg/kg Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE), it affected vascular mechanisms that regulate the resistance in a systemic circulation, resulting in an induction of significant reduction of Total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR), and therefore systolic pressure (SAP), diastolic (DAP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP).",01f498f3-515d-4014-926c-b5be1ea10d61
27,discussion2," Contrary, changes involving cardiac mechanisms which reflected on HR and CO occurred after application of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) in a dose of 50 mg/kg. The heart rate in Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)50 group was significantly reduced, leading to the decrease of CO and also to the decrease of blood pressure. On the other hand, in Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)25 group, blood pressure was also decreased, but at the expense of significant peripheral vasodilation (decreased total peripheral resistance), without altering the CO or HR. Previously, we demonstrated that acute oral administration of 2 g/kg of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) reduces systolic pressure (SAP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (Dekanski et al.",128aee40-4b70-498f-aabe-a367aedc5a10
28,discussion3,", 2014[8]), and that 30 min duration of antihypertensive action of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) (50 mg/kg) is NO-independent, whereby retaining antihypertensive effect occurs even after the blocked synthesis of NO, indicating that Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) in a dose of 50 mg/kg achieves blood pressure-lowering by mechanisms other than NO (Miloradović et al., 2013[27]). The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE), concurrent with the calcium channel blocking activity, as a result of the synergistic activity of OP and other components of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE), was assumed by Susalit et al. (2011[40]) in the clinical study in which the antihypertensive effect of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) and captopril were compared.",2c76a80e-98a3-48f8-b901-6a7382e0c432
29,discussion4," However, the study of a cardiotonic and antiarrhythmic effects of olive derivatives has shown that the effect of oleanolic acid (10 mg/kg) was similar to the effect of propranolol, a nonselective beta blocker (2 mg/kg) (Somova et al., 2004[37]). The fact that in our study, blood pressure was normalized after the administration of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) (25 and 50 mg/kg), but not the OP (10 mg/kg) alone, led us to a conclusion that other components presented in the extract could be responsible for Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)-induced systemic haemodynamic alterations, or possibly, the synergism between the OP and those other components are important for such response. Our finding that the OP does not contribute to blood pressure lowering effect of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) is in accordance with previous findings, which showed OP (10 and 20 mg/kg during the 3 or 6 weeks) had no effects on blood pressure in rabbits with myocardial infarction (Andreadou et al.",e232caf5-580a-411c-98b3-a29f0abc4c07
30,discussion5,", 2007[3]), or did not show antiarrhythmic effects in isolated rat heart (Esmailidehaj et al., 2012[12]).   Pulse pressure is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Previously, it has been shown that alpha/beta blocker in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)I reduces the cardiovascular risk due to a decrease in pulse pressure (Jovanovic et al., 2009[17]). The present results also demonstrate a significant reduction in pulse pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after a dose of 50 mg/kg Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) during the acute application, which may be explained by the previously mentioned angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)I activity, or the possible beta blockers effects of the extract (Susalit et al., 2011[40]).",49837116-1c88-459b-a747-7ef67175d56b
31,discussion6,"  Earlier, we showed up to 3 fold higher CVR in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) than in their normotensive counterparts, and that this could be significantly improved by acute polyphenol reach plant extract treatment (Mihailovic-Stanojevic et al., 2016[25]). Here, the lower doses of the Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE), 5 and 25 mg/kg, also led to a significant reduction of CVR of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which in the case of a dose of 25 mg/kg was concomitant with a significant decrease of mean arterial pressure (MAP). The reduction of CVR was absent after application of a dose of 50 mg/kg Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) and 10 mg/kg OP, further confirming the contribution of vascular mechanisms (involved in the regulation of systemic and regional vascular resistance) in a fall of blood pressure in the group Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)25.  Haemodynamic changes in the kidney have a significant role in the maintenance of hypertension.",7d0c1433-b2be-4b08-a8c4-1a0743f41169
32,discussion7," Back in 1986, Ando and co-workers showed high positive correlation between renal resistance and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in patients with essential hypertension. Specifically, the treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)I, captopril, has led to a significant decrease in the renal resistance and mean arterial blood pressure, while the blood flow through the renal artery was slightly, but not significantly increased (Ando et al., 1986[2]). Our results of renal haemodynamics are in accordance with the before mentioned, because, the application of an Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE), as well as OP, for which it has long been established to have angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity (Hansen et al., 1996[15]), had no significant effect on blood flow through the renal artery. On the other hand, doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE), and 10 mg/kg of OP lead to a reduction in the resistance of the vascular bed of hypertensive rats.",2ca166d3-90da-40ef-82d1-ae47cb110ed8
33,discussion8," This decrease in RVR in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with lower doses of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE), together with a statistically significant reduction in the CVR, significantly contributes to the reduction of Total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR) and the normalization of blood pressure in our experimental model of essential hypertension.  In our previous study, we already showed that hypertension is followed by increased oxidative stress (Miloradović et al., 2013[27]). After all Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) treatments (5, 25, and 50 mg/kg), in the present study, there was a significant reduction of plasma lipid peroxidation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), as well as in the group treated with 10 mg/kg of OP alone, in comparison to the control group. It is well known that Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) has potent in vitro (Hayes et al.",c7d23dcb-3204-49fd-bd48-ce1eeec3216d
34,discussion9,", 2011[16]), as well as, in vivo antioxidant activity due to the synergy between flavonoids, oleuropeosides and substituted phenols (El and Karakaya, 2009[11]). Since the oxidative stress in the circulation of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), in our study, showed the same trend of decreasing after administration of all three doses of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE), it can be assumed that the antioxidant response is not dose-dependent, and since it is almost the same in the OP group compared to Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)50, the OP may be held responsible for this effect. In accordance with our results is the study of long-term effects of OP which shows that OP (oral dose of 15 mg/kg) reduces the oxidative stress, the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), total cholesterol, and triglycerides in the model of the ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes (Alirezaei et al., 2012[1]).",0df8dd6b-63d7-43a0-be77-d31be62a27b3
35,discussion10,"   Acute application of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) in doses of 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg, led to a reduction in the total cholesterol level, which points to the hypocholesterolemic effect of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE). Treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with 5 and 25 mg/kg of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE), has led to a statistically significant decrease in triglyceride compared to control and Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)50 group. In rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes (Ghanema and Sadek, 2012[14]), the group treated with the Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) showed a reduction of the level of total cholesterol and triglycerides, but also the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) as a result of reduced oxidative stress due to increased concentrations of antioxidative enzymes.",b516cc9e-989c-4a26-9dab-a3547a5af21c
36,discussion11," In our experiment, high density lipoproteins (HDL) was also decreased by all doses of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) compared to the control group, but most pronounced in the group administered with a dose of 50 mg/kg of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE). The triglyceride level was higher in this group compared to OP10 group. A significant reduction in the level of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and the increase in levels of triglycerides (Perona et al., 2004[31]), has been previously observed in elderly hypertensive subjects who used olive oil in their diet and were treated with beta-blockers and diuretics.",76d9c44d-ae84-425c-887b-b60af46a6713
37,discussion12," Given the fact that beta blockers tend to increase triglyceride levels (direct reduction of their catabolism), while reducing the level of high density lipoproteins (HDL) (Brook, 2000[6]), and with our assumption that high doses of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) exhibit their antihypertensive and cardioprotective properties, among other things, by blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptor, it can be concluded that beta blockers characteristic of the components present in the 50 mg/kg Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE), different from the OP, are responsible for a significant increase in the concentration of triglycerides and the reduction of the amount of high density lipoproteins (HDL) in our study. However, there are opposing opinions about the effects of olive rich diet on high-density lipoproteins (high density lipoproteins (HDL)).",e92f2d8c-587c-439b-916a-16ea26828a43
38,discussion13," Some studies showed that this diet can lead to a decrease of high density lipoproteins (HDL) due to a higher concentration of unsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, and squalen (Mensink and Katan, 1992[24]; Perona et al., 2004[31]). On the other hand, a diet rich in virgin olive oil can increase plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL) levels (Rondanelli et al., 2016[35]). In a study comparing the effects of olive leaf extract (500 mg twice daily during 8 weeks, ~ 12.5 mg/kg/day) and captopril on blood pressure and lipid profile in patients with the stage 1 hypertension (Susalit et al., 2011[40]), in addition to the antihypertensive activity, there was a significant reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels after administration of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE), compared with the group treated with captopril, in which there was no change of lipid status.",ab3fe16a-7393-433c-91d9-9ae8c65ddee8
39,discussion14,"   In conclusion, the lowest used dose of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE), 5 mg/kg, successfully abolished oxidative stress and showed a trend to normalize regional (carotid and renal) haemodynamics, but was insufficient to reduce blood pressure. Medium dose, 25 mg/kg, was revealed as the most effective in reducing cardiovascular risks by improving systemic and regional haemodynamics, oxidative stress and lipid profile. Furthermore, the dose of 50 mg/kg Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) causes the improvement of blood pressure, antioxidative defense and cardiac performances in such acute study, but it tends to retain elevated vascular resistance, therefore reducing the inflow of blood into the brain and kidneys of the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).",35c0f2ea-323f-4a5e-bed4-860c40fe0d92
40,discussion15," The main constituent of this standardized extract, OP alone, failed to ameliorate systemic haemodynamics, indicating that other components of Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE) are responsible for changes of cardiac function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The antioxidative potential, but also the ability of OP to improve the lipid profile, unlike the Olea europaea L leaf extract (OLE)50, enables it to act as cardioprotectant.
