2,methods2," Preparation of Oleocanthal-Xylitol Solid Dispersion (SD) Formulation for Animal Dosing  The (−)-Oleocanthal and (+)-xylitol (1:7) SD formulation was prepared using the hot melt fusion method as previously described [22]. Briefly, (+)-xylitol, m.p 93–100 °C, a hydrophilic carrier, was melted by using an IKARCT basic hotplate at 100 °C, and OC (5 mg per batch) was then added. The SD mixture of OC-xylitol was made to formulate OC, an oily compound, into a powder form. OC was added to melted xylitol at a ratio of 1:7, w/w. This ratio proved ideal for creating a favorable powder formulation, which has been fully characterized [22]. The molten mixture was quickly cooled by pouring into a non-sticky pan and subjected to N2 flow for 5 min. Once solidified, the mixture was grinded and stored at room temperature in a dark place for at least 24 h before analysis.  2.2.2.",68b5b671-89db-40cc-8716-d02a260dc173

The core analysis function feature in the software was used to interpret the differentially expressed data, which included canonical pathways, biological processes, up- and downstream transcriptional regulators, and gene networks. In addition to the tool most broadly utilized in this work, the comparison analysis, which identify trends, similarities, and differences between genes of mouse and human origin, was initialized in MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX) mice, respectively.

OC-X Inhibits Breast Cancer Growth and Metastasis to Lungs in MMTV-PyVT Transgenic Mice  The encouraging in vitro and in vivo results of OC anti-Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) activity via targeting the critical receptor tyrosine kinase (receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)) c-Met warranted further in vivo studies in more advanced heterogeneous tumor models [20,35,36,37].",c16400db-febf-4d4a-ac54-3a6ccb7dbfbc
12,methods12," The MMTV-PyVT mice are a commercially available unique genetically engineered mice model of Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) [25]. MMTV-PyVT female mice spontaneously develop luminal-like premalignant hyperplasia mammary intraepithelial neoplastic lesions in most mammary glands by the age of three weeks, and these spread throughout the entire mammary fat pad by seven weeks age [25]. This mice model mimics the pathological processes and microenvironments found in human Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) [25]. The tumor onset is highly accelerated, quickly reaching 1.7–2.5-fold, and mammary lesion extent and histologic grades reach peak multifocal dysplastic level by 12 weeks age [25]. MMTV-PyVT mice have a high chance of developing pulmonary metastasis, which occurs in 80–90% of mice [32].",98e43d2a-e71b-4b68-b7e2-7b24dcaaa5dc
13,methods13," Accordingly, investigation of OC-X activity in MMTV-PyVT mice presents an ideal preclinical model for heterogeneous mammary carcinogenesis to study OC pharmacodynamics and molecular mechanisms (Figure 1). OC-X (equivalent to 7.5 mg/kg OC, n = 4) and placebo (n = 3) were administered to mice 6×/week by oral gavage, started on the fourth week of mice age and continued for seven consecutive weeks. Mice were monitored by daily measuring of their body weight, palpable tumor initiation, and volume in each mammary gland. OC-X therapeutic effects were evaluated by comparing the incidence of palpable lesions and the volume and weight of collected tumors at the end of the experiment. OC-X formulation evidently delayed the emergence of palpable lesions, especially in the lower mammary glands of the mice body for three weeks compared to the first visible lesion observed in the control group, which appeared after six weeks of the mice’s life (Figure 2A).",690f22e8-c2c8-45c3-8b35-e41649c548a5
14,methods14," Moreover, tumor progression was significantly reduced by OC-X treatments compared to the control group. In particular, the observed mean tumor volume between the 6th and 11th weeks were markedly decreased in the OC-X treated group. This tumor burden reduction translated into a 90% inhibition of total tumor growth compared to the placebo control group on the last study day (Figure 2A). The mean tumor weight for the OC-X treated group was 0.28 ± 0.08 g compared to 1.06 ± 0.29 g for the placebo group, i.e., 73% inhibition of the tumor burden (Figure 2B). By the middle of the 11th week, mice were sacrificed when the tumor size of one mouse in the control group approached 2000 mm3, the cutoff tumor burden limit specified in the approved protocol. Nearly 28 mammary glands out of 30 (93%) developed tumors in the control-treated group, while only 22 glands out of 40 developed tumor lesions in the OC-X treated group (55%, Figure 2C).",9f8efde7-ac34-4afb-9365-41057615ba7e
15,methods15," Over the course of the experiment, there was a small body weight reduction observed during the earlier study days in the OC-X treated mice group, while no other adverse effects or clinical pattern changes were observed versus the control group (Figure 2D).  The effects of OC-X treatment on the cellular morphology and histology of mice tumors were examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Morphological examination of tumors showed increased angiogenesis signs surrounding the control-treated mouse tumor surface (Figure 2E, left). Moreover, histological analysis of tumor lesions demonstrated typical Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)-associated morphological features in the placebo control-treated mouse tumors, including a ribbon-like architecture related to central necrosis, increased geographic tumor necrosis, and apoptotic body and stromal lymphocytic response (Figure 2E, left and Supplementary Figure S1) [32,38].",7a8b6354-cf01-4546-b3ff-f0960920a869
16,methods16," In contrast, these advanced tumor features could not be detected in OC-X treated mice, which only had typical malignancy features represented by solid sheets of malignant cells. On the other hand, control group mouse lungs demonstrated loss of the highly vascular flat shiny surface compared to the OC-X treated mouse lungs, which contrarily showed well-structured and less vascular morphology (Figure 2E, right). H&E stained lung section histopathological analysis further indicated that the control group mouse lungs were occupied by multiple lesions with several nuclei, while few such lesions were obviously visible in the OC-X treated mice group.  3.2.",e75135e6-1f1d-4bec-9d31-00330cfcb53c

The results demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor volume and tumor weight compared to the vehicle-treated control group (Figure 3A). OC-X treatments suppressed 47% of tumor growth at the study end versus the vehicle-treated control group. The mean mice tumor volume on the final study day was 1417 ± 94 mm3 and 666 ± 180 mm3 for the vehicle control and OC-X treated groups, respectively (Figure 3B). Furthermore, the mean tumor weight in the vehicle-treated control group was 1.91 ± 0.17 g, while the mean tumor weight for the OC-X treated mice group was 1.09 ± 0.22 g (Figure 3C).",9e841f41-642c-430f-a3b2-e73964d3bde0
19,methods19," OC-X treatment caused a mild reduction in mice body weight at the initial treatment days, but, later, this weight reduction was stabilized for the rest of the study course, and did not cause any additional animal weight reduction versus the placebo group, suggesting possible preliminary safety (Figure 3D).  3.3. Microarray-Based Gene Signature of OC-X Treatments in MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX) Mouse Tumors  Tumor samples of OC-X and control-treated MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX) mice were subjected to Mouse/Human Gene Chip Clariom™ S array analysis, which serves as a next-generation transcriptome profiling tool. This technology is widely used for the detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to explore gene-level expression correlation among treatment groups, revealing the effectiveness of the targeted treatment [33].",437a4fd0-ab20-486b-98d0-0b7b9b573820
20,methods20," Preliminary bioinformatics analysis of the raw data of the MMTV-PyVT tumor sample results of the Mouse Clariom S Microarray analysis revealed 1805 genes affected by OC-X treatment out of 22,206 genes (Figure 4A).

Predicted and Overlapped Canonical Pathways and Presumptive Diseases in Response to OC-X in MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX) Mouse Tumors  Ingenuity pathway analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)) software evaluated the canonical pathways affected by OC-X treatments in MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse tumors, offering insights into gene-level signatures in these heterogeneous Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) representative models. Canonical pathways analysis took advantage of the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) library to predict the markedly affected signaling pathways associated with the most differentially expressed genes in response to OC-X treatments [42].",1c8af691-505e-430c-a65a-a12e3eac89c5
22,methods22," Affected canonical pathways evaluated in both animal models were based on the z-value, which compares the significance of the affected pathways between treatment and control datasets. A negative z-score indicates deactivation of a particular pathway functionality compared to the range of normal activity in the database. One striking outcome of the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) predictive analysis was highlighting the overlapped top-most downregulated PD-1/PD-L1 cancer immunotherapy pathway, PI3K-AKT, and protein kinase A signaling pathways in both MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse tumors following OC-X treatments versus the control group (Figure 4C).

Pathway Analysis Gives Insight into Gene Differentiation Expressed in MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX) Array Data after OC-X Treatment  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to determine the OC-X treatment effects on the expression levels of genes regulating different Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) pathogenesis stages, including neoplasia, cell-to-cell adhesion signaling and interaction, invasion, migration, and metastasis in MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse tumors based on the z-value, with a two-fold cutoff.",22f0065e-27e2-40ba-b3b3-63531d3030fe
24,methods24," The results showed that multiple genes affected either upregulation or downregulation in each stage, including some overlapping affected genes in both mouse models. The study focused only on the cancer pathogenesis-associated genes affected by OC-X treatments through relying primarily on the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) database diseases and function prediction tool.  Analysis of genes downregulated by OC-X treatments in the tumor originally generated in MMTV-PyVT mice mammary glands revealed multiple affected genes with a marginal alteration in the z-score. Affected genes included FGFR1, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1, CLDN4, GRB7, and VCAN, while ezrin (EZR) and MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) were commonly affected in at least four out of five progression stages of the selected cancer levels.",38c299c0-c018-4b50-a902-887abdf27dbe

In the patient derived xenograft (PDX) model, most downregulated genes affected by OC-X treatments included MMP9, CXCL12, MMP13, and POSTN within the selected cancer stages. Moreover, several other commonly important genes were also reduced by more than two-fold, including CCL2, PDGFRA, MET, ROR1, and FN1. On the other hand, EFEMP1, B4GALNT2, and haematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) were predicted to be the topmost upregulated genes, with the highest z-values in the human patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumors (Figure 5B).  3.6.",31f334dd-6d10-452c-83be-eaf9dfaaa600

To test the overall similarity between OC-X treatment effects on gene expression alteration in MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse tumors, the predicted pathway activity generated from each model tumor was compared using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) comparison analysis tool.

27,methods27," Without applying any filtration cutoffs, about 5849 genes were affected by OC-X treatments in MMTV-PyVT compared to 3085 genes affected in patient derived xenograft (PDX). However, a filtration cutoff of 1.5-fold of the z-score was applied, along with the elimination of the less relevant heat map biomarkers, as no analysis satisfied the filter cutoff. The resulting heat maps showed over 192 downregulated genes overlapped in both models, with various z negative values (Figure 6). Meanwhile, only 120 overlapping genes were upregulated.  Considering the different origin of array data and the z-score variation between both models within the same gene, the overlapping genes were sorted in an ascending order based on the z-score in the patient derived xenograft (PDX) dataset (Figure 6A, left panel), then sorted with the same order, but based on the z-score in the MMTV-PyVT dataset (Figure 6A, right panel).",5998d386-028a-43bd-90cc-e2c3fcab4059
28,methods28," Among the top 15 genes proved common in both models, the comparison analysis revealed DCLK1 as the only downregulated gene with a significant z-score, −2.47-fold and −4.01-fold in MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX), respectively. Similarly, using the same approach in the topmost upregulated genes, CA3 showed 31.35- and 7.84-fold, SERPINB4 showed 96.65- and 2.98-fold, EFEMP1 showed 14.0- and 2.43-fold, and indolethylamine N methyltransferase (INMT) showed 340.75- and 2.3-fold upregulation in MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX), respectively (Figure 6B).  The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Gene Growing Analysis tool was used to uncover the affected genes associated with DCLK1, CA3, SERPINB4, EFEMP1, and indolethylamine N methyltransferase (INMT) individually and to trace the biological interplay of these genes with other relevant molecular pathways (Supplementary Figure S3).",6831ca8a-2b99-402d-a595-77da8d01ae92
29,methods29," To find potential upstream regulators, which can affect the expression of these genes, the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Connection Analysis tool was used to simultaneously connect all affected genes. Interestingly, MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) was identified as an upstream biomarker that could associate directly and indirectly with DCLK1, SERPINB4, and EFEMP1, but could only connect indirectly to indolethylamine N methyltransferase (INMT) and CA3 (Figure 7A). Additional data analyses revealed that the main biological function outcomes of OC-X treatments could potentially be attributed to the MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) downregulation by a more than −2.4-fold change, plausibly suppressing all previously reported Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) progression stages, including neoplasia, cell proliferation, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, invasion, migration, and metastasis (Figure 7B).",cd687022-8ae1-4d34-8065-634e2498d45a

Discussion  Natural products have a standing success record for the control of various cancer types [43,44]. Natural products are gaining increased attention for their ample sustained sources, target novelty and selectivity, plausible relative safety profiles, and cost-effectiveness compared to conventional synthetic drugs [45]. Previous studies on OC, a representative mono-phenolic secoiridoid primarily extracted from extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), manifested its inhibitory effects on BC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis.",6dbd22d1-3d8c-4c2b-9a07-6b12262f66be
31,methods31," The OC anti-BC activity margin included Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and luminal BC phenotypes [17,18,22,23,35]. Particularly, OC suppressed the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation as a major regulator of the progression of multiple cancers, including Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Dysregulation of the HGF/c-Met axis in human malignancies activates various downstream effectors and pathways, such as Akt, MAPK, STAT-3, HSP90, ERα, PI3K, and mTOR, resulting in an aggressive profile [17,18,36]. Moreover, OC suppressed its target, c-Met, in in vivo multiple human BC phenotypes xenografted in nude mice and selectively suppressed the malignancy progression at tolerated daily oral doses of 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally 3×/week [17,18,23,35,36]. Although it is clear that OC exerts antitumor activity against multiple cancers, molecular and gene-level effects have not yet been illustrated in detail [35,46].",0f4a008b-ba8e-4420-9cc3-9beedcd6c79e
32,methods32,"  The results of the current study validated the OC-X oral administration in experimental animals to suppress mammary carcinogenesis in MMTV-PyVT transgenic mice. Moreover, OC-X suppressed the initiation and incidence of new tumor clusters in MMTV-PyVT mice mammary glands, and inhibited the metastases of BC to the lungs compared to the control group. This study’s results provided evidence that OC-X was able to suppress tumor growth and survival using mice engrafted with human patient BC (patient derived xenograft (PDX)), an established pseudoclinical animal model that maintains the pathogenesis of human cancer. However, the results show that OC-X treatment was more effective in MMTV-PyVT than patient derived xenograft (PDX)-Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) mice, possibly due to the advanced progression and aggressiveness of the engrafted human patient tumors in patient derived xenograft (PDX) mice and the shorter treatment period compared to the MMTV-PyVT transgenic mice model.",e8fffbb9-e3de-490c-86ef-e21ebdfc34b7
33,methods33,"  Nevertheless, the remarkable anti-tumor activity of OC-X in preclinically relevant heterogeneous Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) mice models following an oral administration of 7.5 mg/kg OC-X 6×/week for 75 days in MMTV-PyVT and 21 days in patient derived xenograft (PDX) mice neither showed frank signs of systemic toxicity nor significant body weight changes. These findings propose the OC-X formula potentiality to exhibit clinically potent anticancer effects without noticeable toxicity, unlike most targeted cancer therapies.  Microarray-based gene transcription/expression profiling is a well-defined robust trait methodology, which can simultaneously detect the expression levels of all genes and measure the differences between tumor and control samples to distinguish the main changes occurring in response to intervention treatments [47].",942954af-a651-47fe-a96f-a2a98e3996b4
34,methods34," Fortunately, most of the genes identified in both tumor samples were coding or multiple complex genes (contained more than one locus type or a complex gene family), which facilitated its connection with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) database. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) analysis predicted the modulation of several cancer-related canonical pathways and biological diseases in both MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models in response to OC-X treatments. Microarray results indicated that OC-X treatment suppressed the total c-Met expression level in patient derived xenograft (PDX) tissues by 2.38-fold versus the vehicle control. Although the total c-Met expression level change by OC-X was limited, there was a significant suppression of several c-Met downstream effectors due to the potential inhibition of the intratumoral activation level c-Met (Y1234/1235) by OC-X treatment, which has already been reported in several studies [18,20,22,23,36].",e44ce19d-12cf-4318-a433-3d8ba27e544b
35,methods35,"  This study aimed to identify the OC-X treatment gene signature effects and tracing affected cellular pathways in Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models and the associated progression stages, including neoplasia, cell-to-cell adhesion signaling and interaction, invasion, migration, and metastasis. Indeed, utilizing two advanced heterogeneous Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse models that have been marketed as preclinical/pseudoclinical models with close similarity to human tumors added translational value to the study outcomes.  In detail, the MMTV-PyVT mice tumor gene microarray analysis identified fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) as the topmost downregulated gene in the neoplasia stage. The FGFR is a tyrosine kinase receptor that acts as an oncogenic driver conducted for several types of tumors, and thus is assumed as a poor prognostic progression marker in female cancer patients [48].",c00cdd99-c2e4-4ff2-bb8d-aa1d8d6aa4ef
36,methods36," Amplification of the FGFR is common in several malignancies, including Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and leads to the induction of tumor cell proliferation and migration, blockage of apoptosis, and promotion of epithelial-to-mesenchymal (epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT)) transitions [49]. Thus, suppression of FGFR1 expression by OC-X treatments was fundamental in reducing the MMTV-PyVT mouse tumor volume. Furthermore, OC-X treatments downregulated the expression of insulin receptor substrate (insulin receptor substrate (IRS)), another critical cell cycle regulator that has been extensively dysregulated in cancer cells [50]. insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1 is a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that transmits signals from insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) to conduct normal cellular and metabolic processes [50].",fc5286cf-8328-4922-949f-0e1afac61b6d
37,methods37," Cancer cells could dominate the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) expression level to promote proliferation and survival, along with a response from IGF-1 and its downstream signal transducers, resulting in an elevated expression level of ERα in hormone-dependent BC, which converts to Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) through the tumor progression sequence [51]. Therefore, OC-X modulation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) signal transduction pathway could provide a gleam of potential to control Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and other insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-dependent cancers.",33039843-f7e6-45a6-8cf0-2d211b5c2d51
38,methods38," Several other important protein coding genes, such as protein kinase C alpha type (protein kinase C alpha type (PRKCA)), MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) proto-oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC)), S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (SKP2), and ezrin (ezrin (EZR)), have also been downregulated two-fold or more by OC-X treatments. Extensive studies in the literature indicate that these genes commonly augment BC and other cancer growth, neoplasia, invasion, migration, and metastasis [52,53,54,55]. The overexpression of these genes in BC correlates with poor patient survival [55]. This finding justifies the OC-X treatment antimetastatic activity in the MMTV-PyVT mice model, which was associated with a significant reduction of these genes’ expressions in the collected tumor samples.",a9a84fef-99ac-417b-9d60-e2d9887eb3e3
39,methods39,"  On the other hand, the transcriptome array results strongly indicate that OC-X treatments modulated MMTV-PyVT mice tumor progression, survival, and metastasis through significantly upregulating multiple cancer-related biomarkers and their downstream pathway genes. Microarray results proved that OC-X treatments markedly enhanced mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), secretoglobin (secretoglobin (SCGB)) 3A1, nitric oxide synthase traffic inducer (NOSTRNA integrity number (RIN)), and endoglin (endoglin (ENG)) expression levels by at least five-fold or more versus the vehicle control. A brief look at these genes in the literature demonstrates that the overexpression of UCP1 selectively suppressed BC growth by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the activation of its cellular catabolism pathway [56]. Furthermore, secretoglobin (SCGB)3A1 was originally identified in both mouse and human tumor specimens [57].",7847c445-d38b-4e0c-88cb-e1ff7573fa95
40,methods40," Evidently, the secretoglobin (SCGB)3A1 tumor suppressive functions were illustrated as the inhibition of malignant cell growth, invasion, and migration through the AKT signaling pathway [58]. Silencing of secretoglobin (SCGB)3A1 expression through methylation is well-established in human breast, lung, prostate, and pancreatic cancers [57]. Substantially, this study documented the promoting effect of OC-X treatments on the secretoglobin (SCGB)3A1 pathway, translated by a more than 17,351-fold upregulation, the highest upregulated gene in the dataset.",64a7aa74-7748-4454-b241-07190d8d9653
41,methods41," In contrast to secretoglobin (SCGB)3A1, the functional role of the endothelial NOSTRNA integrity number (RIN) in cancer has not been fully described, although, in pancreatic cancer, NOSTRNA integrity number (RIN) has been identified as a protein that binds to the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and manipulates its intracellular efficiency, reducing nitric oxide (NO) generation, which directly suppresses the tumor’s migratory and invasive properties [59]. Likewise, another stimulatory effect for OC-X treatment is its promotion of endoglin (ENG) expression. endoglin (ENG) is a protein primarily upregulated during angiogenesis, and can inhibit cell migration, invasion, and metastatic colonization in vitro and in vivo by mitigating the effects of transforming growth factor beta protein (TGF-β), which is activated during the invasion and migration oncogenic stages [60].",577a7c31-8d9f-489e-bdea-70669b95d979
42,methods42," Thus, elevated endoglin (ENG) expression is associated with an improved primary tumor response rate for neoadjuvant therapy, which is correlated with improved clinical outcomes in several studies [61].  Similar to the above findings, this study observed a list of important genes related to the neoplasia, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, invasion, migration, and metastasis effectively manipulated by OC-X treatments in patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse tumors. For instance, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) gene analyses revealed matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) as the most downregulated gene in the neoplasia stage. Interestingly, MMP9 has a fundamental role in promoting invasion, migration, and metastasis in breast and several other malignancies. Of note, numerous studies have already shown that MMP9 is an influential prognostic marker for Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2 positive BC [62].",ff66002f-b400-4cdd-ab06-cbb8c8f37241
43,methods43," Moreover, MMP13 is another affected MMP family gene that shares common structural and functional similarities with MMP9, and is validated to play major roles in Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) pathogenesis. The major role of MMP overexpression in Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is enhancing invasion and subsequent metastasis in patients by degradation of the extracellular matrix (extracellular matrix (ECM)), allowing cancer cells to metastasize freely [63]. Several other important genes were also downregulated by more than two-fold in response to OC-X treatments in patient derived xenograft (PDX) mice. These included C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), c-Met, receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1), and fibronectin 1 (FN1), which are associated with activated neoplasia, invasion, migration, and metastasis. In fact, activation of these genes proved to promote Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) aggressiveness, growth, and metastasis [64,65,66,67].",c2041bce-cf13-4b7c-b326-838f6d293139
44,methods44,"  On the other hand, OC-X treatments showed a marginal upregulating effect on patient derived xenograft (PDX) model genes. However, OC-X treatments notably boosted haematopoietically expressed homeobox (haematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX)) expressions among the most affected genes with a wide role in Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and other cancers. The haematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) is an essential transcription factor that exhibits tumor suppression by regulating the translation of specific mRNAs in various breast, liver, and thyroid cancers [68]. haematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) overexpression can also regulate the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) and TGFβ co-receptor endoglin, suppressing BC cell proliferation and migration [69]. Clinically, lower haematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) expression is correlated with disease-free survival in BC patients [70].",313b3c5c-9954-4bbc-a907-692862cb7b15
45,methods45," Low haematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) expression is common in Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone-negative and basal-like BCs [70]. Furthermore, β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (B4GALNT2) is a biosynthetic enzyme of histo-blood group antigens Sda antigen, a natural component of the red blood cells in the healthy colon of a vast majority of people [71]. Prior studies have shown that the downregulation of B4GALNT2 can be a marker for colon and gastrointestinal cancers [71,72]. Direct upregulation of the B4GALNT2 gene level reduces the colon malignancy and the stem-associated malignant phenotype in a highly selective fashion [73]. To our knowledge, this is the first report of systemic B4GALNT2 upregulation in breast cancer, and further investigation is needed to validate the present findings.",626f9058-e4ba-439a-bed2-a97913e451f5
46,methods46,"  The main purpose of this study was to compare the OC-X treatment effects on key genes and mainstream regulators that differentially modulate expressed genes in two heterogeneous Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) preclinical mouse models. Therefore, we performed pairwise gene code comparisons utilizing Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) analysis to identify the common genes with a significant confidence prediction z-score in both models. The results focused on the topmost affected 15 genes in both MMTV-PyVT and patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumor lysate arrays. Therapeutically, the doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) was the most useful downregulated gene, while indolethylamine N methyltransferase (INMT), CA3, Sirpinb4, and EFEMP1 were the best upregulated genes, overlapping in both mouse models. Interestingly, these genes play a crucial role in Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and other cancers.",120d605c-fbe2-4be6-a7c0-b3ea909e13ca
47,methods47," DCLK1 is a microtubule binding kinase protein, which has been extensively studied in the field of neurodevelopment due to its microtubule polymerizing function of the doublecortin domains that are crucial for neuronal migration [74]. In the cancer context, DCLK1 plays a role in the cellular migration of multiple types of cancer, including colorectal, pancreatic, liver, and breast cancers [75]. Dysregulation of DCLK1 in humans and mice is associated with activated pathological cancer stages. DCLK1 is a cancer stem cell (cancer stem cell (CSC)) marker, which promotes initiation, aggressiveness, and metastasis through many pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway [76,77]. Thus, the OC-X treatment suppression of DCLK1 in both models implies potential therapeutic applications to control Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).",c25a6bc3-101a-49d0-bd77-df4c1b44b90f
48,methods48,"  The association between CA3, SERPINB4, EFEMP1, and indolethylamine N methyltransferase (INMT) expressions with the Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) progression remains a matter of debate. For example, carbonic anhydrases 3 (CA3) is a cytoplasmic metalloenzyme protein, whose function is to mediate the aging oxidative insult, and is considered a marker for cancer cell hypoxia [78,79]. However, the roles of CA3 in BC pathogenesis are still unclear [78,79]. Concurrently, the serine/cysteine protease inhibitor SERPINB3, which is directly manipulated by SERPINB4, is modulated by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α), and has been recently proven to be upregulated in human hepatoblastoma [79,80]. However, no relevant literature validates the relationship between the expression of SERPINB3 or 4 and clinical outcomes in BC [80,81].",ed8c130e-ed65-4ac1-8b6c-b21b6bd34040
49,methods49," Meanwhile, indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (indolethylamine N methyltransferase (INMT)) is a type 1 transmethylation enzyme known for its capability to deliver methyl groups, forming methylated compounds, such as N,N-dimethyltryptamine (dimethyltryptamine (DMT)). Reduced expression of indolethylamine N methyltransferase (INMT) has been associated with enhanced non-small cell lung cancer (non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)) adenocarcinomas and prostate cancer [82,83]. However, there is no evidence illustrating the role of indolethylamine N methyltransferase (INMT) in breast cancer. Finally, there are conflicting reports regarding the function of EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1) in diverse cancer types.",98944bd7-6f20-4869-b212-8760b5435117
50,methods50," For example, overexpression of EFEMP1 eliminated tumor development and suppressed angiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A expression in hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric and prostate cancers, and glioblastoma [84,85], while the converse was true with ovarian and breast cancers [86]. Overall, our data reveal that OC-X treatment can upregulate these genes confidently in both models, and thus, further study is needed in the future for the effect of each particular gene with OC.  Interestingly, the generation of gene networks for the top five overlapping affected genes demonstrated that MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) can be the only direct or indirect connector for these genes. Thus, the relationship between MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) and these genes should be within the understanding of the essential role of MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) in Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) progression.",bc1f956e-4128-4771-9aa6-ec3246cf5b84
51,methods51," MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) is a heterogeneous proto-oncogene encoding various transcription factors, leading to participation in many aspects of tumor cellular functions. Indeed, numerous clinical studies have suggested MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) overexpression as a marker for poor outcomes in Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients through various pathways and mechanisms, including: (i) promoting cell proliferation and survival via PI3K, (ii) mediating mammary stem cell amplification as a cascade of Wnt/β-catenin activation, (iii) accelerating cell cycle activity associated with a high expression of cyclin B1 and Ki67, and (iv) enhancing tumor angiogenesis by activating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling [87,88]. Impressively, results showed a 2.",701d01e4-5941-45db-b015-61f7c3c8c8be
52,methods52,"4-fold downregulation of MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) in response to OC-X treatments in MMTV-PyVT mice, combined with the effects of its up- and downstream effectors. However, a slight increase in MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) expression was observed in the patient derived xenograft (PDX) model. Consistent with the previous OC suppressive effect on c-Met, the result of combining MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) blockade and c-Met inhibition in heterogeneous mouse models heightened the therapeutic potential of OC from various oncological and biological aspects. Finally, modification of MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) by manipulating the five abovementioned genes in both animal models possibly represents a good starting point for better future understanding of OC molecular mechanisms in Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).  5.",43ebf460-a3f7-4ffd-ac8f-a0bf9069da36
53,methods53," Conclusions  In summary, this study demonstrated the OC-X suppressed the progression and initiation of heterogeneous mouse and human Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in valid preclinical and pseudo-clinical advanced animal models. The study findings provide preclinical evidence supporting OC-X’s potential as a promising nutraceutical active against heterogeneous Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Differential gene expression analysis of heterogeneous Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) microarray data was an exemplary approach for improving the understanding of the molecular effects, gene signature, and pharmacodynamics of OC-X, which may aid the prediction of new molecular target pathways. Comparing the microarray data from mice and human tumor origins proved a promising strategy to assess and validate the clinical validity in human subjects and identify the most affected genes in response to the OC-X treatments.",e1a98302-9161-4d30-ae87-acf14b221caf
54,methods54," MYC proto oncogene/BHLH transcription factor (MYC) was identified as a key driver for the in vivo anti-BC effects of OC. Based on these results, OC-X assumed as a potential nutraceutical formulation useful for translational application to control Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).
