0,introduction0,"Flavonoids, a large group of polyphenolic compounds in plants, are the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet. Over 5,000 hydroxylated polyphenolic compounds have been isolated and identified (Shashank & Abhay, 2013). Dietary flavonoids are classified into six subclasses according to their chemical structure: anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavanones, flavones, isoflavones and flavan-3-ols.  Observational studies have repeatedly suggested a beneficial health effect of flavonoids intake, although they are inconclusive . Flavonoids intake has been associated with reducing the risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (Knekt et al., 2002; Kim, Vance & Chun, 2016b), some types of cancers , Alzheimer and diabetes (Zamora-Ros et al., 2013a).",6ce55836-987a-4171-ad88-a06de9309beb
1,introduction1," Furthermore, increased intake of most flavonoid subclasses has shown inverse relationship with weight gain in men and women aged 27–65 years , with incidence of hypertension in middle-aged women , and with risk of depression in older women .  The effect of a plant-based diet on the risk of chronic diseases and mortality may partly be due to flavonoid compounds and other plant metabolites (Watzl, 2008). Flavonoids have been found to decrease inflammation, scavenge free radicals (Shashank & Abhay, 2013), and improve vascular endothelial function . Although descriptive studies in adult populations have estimated dietary flavonoids intake, data on flavonoids intake in children and adolescents is scarce despite growing evidence of the preventive effects of dietary flavonoids.",ab696c98-c248-4c17-ad7b-537858d6e59f
2,introduction2,"  High intake of plant-based foods such as fruits and vegetables is an essential characteristic of high diet quality and linked to favorable health outcomes (Hu, 2003; Crowe et al., 2011). The Mediterranean diet is a traditional plant-based dietary pattern, well known for its high vegetables and fruit intake and overall healthy eating pattern (Sebastian et al., 2015b; Sebastian et al., 2015a). The health impact of plant-based diets might be partially explained by the concomitant intake of flavonoids, but evidence on the association between flavonoids intake and diet quality is scarce in adult populations (Sebastian et al., 2015b) and essentially nonexistent in younger people. Similarly, the association between Mediterranean dietary pattern and flavonoids intake has not been studied in children.  Knowledge of population-based flavonoids intake pattern is important for the development of dietary recommendations.",3a345b91-6e19-4914-9bbe-f57e4f7bf9af
3,introduction3," Additionally, the identification of dietary patterns related to increased flavonoids consumption is relevant because of the potential impact of these bioactive compounds in disease prevention. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the intake of flavonoids; describe major sources of flavonoids; and evaluate the association between flavonoids intake and diet quality i.e., measured by the adherence to Mediterranean diet; among Spanish children, adolescence and young adults.

4,methods0,"Study design The enKid Study, described in detail elsewhere (Serra-Majem et al., 2003), was a cross-sectional survey of the nutritional status and food habits of 3,534 Spanish children and young adults, carried out between 1998 and 2000. Participants were selected by multistage random sampling procedures based on a population register. The objective of the EnKid study was two-fold: (1) to establish the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in the population aged 2–24 years; and (2) to analyze the association of these micronutrients with group membership by sex and age. The sample size of 3,850 participants was calculated according to the estimated prevalence of most micronutrients, with 95% confidence interval and accuracy of ±2.5% of the average value of the micronutrient, and a statistical power of 80% to detect significant differences between two groups (=10% of the mean of the micronutrients, setting the alpha error at p = 0.05).",d841233e-17b7-40c5-a5a2-af1e21e752e1
5,methods1," Taking into account an anticipated 70% participation rate, we oversized the study sample size to 5,500 participants (anticipated prevalence of non-participation: n = 1,650 (30%)). Recruitment achieves a sample of 3,534 individuals. Parental written consent was obtained on behalf of each participant younger than 18 years. The ethics committee of the Spanish Society of Community Nutrition approved the study protocol.  Dietary and lifestyle data collection Dietary data was collected during in-home interviews carried out by 43 trained dietitians and nutritionists using household measures to estimate portion sizes. Dietary intake was assessed by 24-hour recall. The same field staff entered survey data into software specifically designed for the study. The 24-hour recall did not include herbs and spices.",943b6f4e-f5cc-427d-9843-a209c848a64a
6,methods2,"  The nutrient database software used for the study consisted of a Spanish database (Mataix Verdú, Aranceta Batrina & Serra-Majem, 1995), completed with information from French and British  food composition tables.  Participants responding to an interviewer-administered questionnaire reported data on maternal education, which was recorded in five categories: (i) no education (never went to school), (ii) primary education not completed, (iii) completed primary education, (iv) secondary education, and (v) university.  Flavonoid food composition database The Phenol-Explorer database, a comprehensive database on polyphenol content in foods, was the main source for flavonoid, isoflavone, and proanthocyanin content used in estimating dietary flavonoid intake in the enKid study. This database has been extracted from more than 1,300 scientific publications and includes 35,000 content values for 500 different polyphenols in more than 400 foods .",995940ec-0c60-470e-afc8-a565c5922545
7,methods3," In addition, US Department of Agriculture (US Department of Agriculture (USDA)) databases were used to determine the flavonoids content of foods not available from Phenol-Explorer data (Bhagwat, Haytowitz & Holden, 2011). Flavonoid intakes from food were measured by multiplying the consumption frequency of each food by its flavonoid content. Flavonoid intake from foods with several varieties was averaged. For example, flavonoid content of “apples” was averaged for the two types of apples listed in Phenol Explorer, cider apples and whole raw dessert apples.",41dc5384-7f62-4f67-a673-900ec5a4542c
8,methods4,"We measured the flavonoid intake of the six subclasses: flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and isorhamnetin), flavones (luteolin and apigenin), flavanones (eriodictyol, hesperetin, and naringenin), flavan-3-ols (catechin, gallocatechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin-3-gallate, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, theaflavin, theaflavin 3-gallate, theaflavin 3′-gallate, theaflavin 3,3′ digallate, and thearubigins), anthocyanidins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonindin, petunidin, and peonidin), and isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, and glycitein). Total flavonoids were calculated as the sum of these subclasses.  KIDMED index Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was estimated by the KIDMED index, derived from a 16-item questionnaire administered separately from the 24-hour recalls as part of the enKid survey (Serra-Majem et al., 2004).",ea73cfc2-cc98-4bd1-ab7b-90ef61f47bb1
9,methods5," The KIDMED index was created specifically to estimate adherence to the Mediterranean diet in children and young adults, based on the principles that sustain the Mediterranean dietary pattern and those that undermine it. Four items denoting lower adherence were assigned a value of −1 (Goes more than once a week to a fast-food restaurant; skips breakfast; has commercially baked goods or pastries for breakfast; takes sweets and candy several times every day) and the 12 items related to higher adherence were scored +1 (Takes a fruit or fruit juice every day; has a second fruit every day; regularly has fresh or cooked vegetables once a day; has fresh or cooked vegetables more than once a day; consumes fish regularly; likes pulses and eats them more than once a week; consumes pasta or rice almost every day (five or more times per week); has cereals or grains (bread, etc.",c24a9b15-4ba6-4395-9912-37cae641bd0e

Scores range from −4 to 12, with higher scores indicating greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet. A low, intermediate, and high adherence to the Mediterranean diet was defined as scoring below 4, between 4 and 7, and more than 7 points for the KIDMED index, respectively.

11,analysis0,"General linear modeling procedures were used to compare baseline participant characteristics by quintiles of total flavonoids intake. Polynomial contrast was used to determine overall p for linear trend for continuous variables with normal distribution, and Kruskal-Wallis test to determine overall p for non-normal distributions. P for linear trend for categorical variables was obtained by Mantel-Haenszel linear-by-linear association chi-square test.  To determine the association between flavonoids and the KIDMED index, we fitted general linear models adjusted for sex, age, maternal education level, energy intake, region, and community size. Polynomial contrast was used to determine overall p for linear trend. Associations were considered significant if P < 0.05. The SPSS for Windows version 18 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, United States) was used for all statistical analysis. ",f061c35b-a3b3-4ae3-9918-8088f179bc4b
12,results4,"  In stratified analysis adjusted for age, maternal education level, energy intake, region and community size, flavonoids intake was greater among girls, and increased with age. The mean total flavonoids intake for girls was 72.1 mg/day, and for boys was 69.1 mg/day. The mean intake of total flavonoids was 81.5 mg/day in the age group “18–24 years”, 62.9 mg/day in “12–17 years”, 63.5 mg/day in “6–11 years”, and 61.8 mg/day for the age group 2–5 years old.  The major dietary sources of total flavonoids intake were fruits (including fruit juices), vegetables, and chocolate products (Table 3). Fruits were the major contributors, accounting for 42.8% of daily total flavonoids intake. Vegetables, particularly spinach, onions, artichokes and lettuce contributed 22% of the daily total; the highest flavonoids intake from vegetables was in the older age group (18–24 years).

15,discussion0,"This study explored the flavonoids intake in the Spanish youth population of the ENKID study. The estimated mean total flavonoids intake was 70.7 mg/d, with flavan-3-ols as the main subclass and fruits and fruit juice as the major dietary source. Energy-adjusted flavonoids intake was slightly higher in girls than boys, and increased with age. Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was correlated with higher flavonoids intake.  Data on flavonoids intake in children are limited. In comparison with previous studies, the mean intake in this population; i.e., 70.7 mg/day for ages 2–24 years, was lower than the intake reported for the US NHANSE 2007–2010 study, i.e., 108.5 mg/day for ages 2–19 years . Based on age groups, total flavonoid intakes for the NHANSE study were 59.5 mg/d for ages 2–5 years, 79.8 mg/d for ages 6–11 years, and 153.6 mg/d for ages 12–17 years (Sebastian et al., 2015a).",d7afd57c-1d5e-4633-bf3c-2c6d7dc87b3a
16,discussion1,"  Comparing flavonoids intake between different studies could be influenced by several factors; for example, by the dietary assessment method, study sample, and the flavonoid database. An Australian study estimated the intake of flavonoids in children, adolescences and young adult used a single 24HR dietary assessment, similar to our study (Johannot & Somerset, 2006). The study reported a mean flavonoids intake of 24.0–181.0 mg/d in 2–24 years old Australians (Johannot & Somerset, 2006). Comparing to our findings in small age groups 2–5 and 6–11 year-old intakes were around 62 mg/d, the intake in the Australian study similar age groups is considerably lower.  In the NHANSE study, flavonoids intake was higher in boys than girls . In our study, however, flavonoids intake was higher in boys than girls only before adjusting for energy intake. A study by Yngve et al.",e5b07288-edf1-4619-86f0-f56590e1f9ec
17,discussion2," (2005) found that children from Spain and Iceland had the lowest fruit and vegetables consumption, and that, among 11-year-olds, boys consumed less vegetables and fruits than girls in five out of nine European countries—but in Spain, boys consumed slightly more than girls.  Similar to our study, flavan-3-ols were the most abundant class of dietary flavonoids in children and adults in the US (Kim, Vance & Chun, 2016a). In the Australian study, flavan-3-ols accounted for 75% of flavonoids intake for the population aged 2 years and older, and up to 92% in adults aged 19 years and older. Australians’ high level of tea consumption contributed 67% of flavonoids intake (Johannot & Somerset, 2006). This finding explains the noticeable difference in flavonoids intake between the Australian population aged 19–24 years and the same age group in our study.",8e629ab5-3930-4c50-8d4b-79af597a7a2a
18,discussion3," After excluding tea flavonoids, the Australian population aged 19–24 years decreased in flavonoids intake from more than 200 mg/day to less than 50 mg/day (Johannot & Somerset, 2006).  Tea was also the major source of flavonoids intake in a US adult population (Kim, Vance & Chun, 2016a). Tea contributed 155.9 mg/d of daily total flavonoids intake in the US adults, compared to 2.3 mg/day in the young adults of our study. One explanation for this extreme difference is that the EnKid dietary data were collected between 1998 and 2000, a period when tea was consumed in low quantities in the Spanish population . In the Spanish European Prospective Investigation into cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study, tea intake contributed 2.2% (6.8 mg/d) of total flavonoids intake (Zamora-Ros et al., 2010).  In Mediterranean countries, fruits and wine are the principal sources for flavonoids intake in adults (Zamora-Ros et al., 2013b).",0ea7bceb-4715-4404-886b-4d9505dac61f
19,discussion4," The findings of the present study confirm the role of fruits as the main dietary contributors to flavonoids intake in children, adolescents, and young adults. Our results are in line with the Spanish European Prospective Investigation into cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study finding that fruits were the main source of flavonoids in younger Mediterranean populations (Zamora-Ros et al., 2010).  Comparisons of flavonoid intakes between different populations and time periods have certain limitations, depending on the degree of consistency in the flavonoid data base used, the dietary assessment method selected, and the timing of the dietary assessments. Our study used a recently developed flavonoid database (Bhagwat, Haytowitz & Holden, 2011; Rothwell et al., 2013), which was not available when most of the cited studies were carry out. According to the most recent report of food consumption in Spain, intake of fruit and vegetables has decreased (Ministerio de Agricultura y Pesca, 2015).",60568d79-5184-4252-a76f-592672bc2ca7
20,discussion5," Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that current flavonoid intakes of Spanish youth are lower than those reported in the EnKid study (Johannot & Somerset, 2006). Similarly, the percentage of the Australian adults not meeting the recommended intake of vegetables and fruits has increased (Canberra: National Health and Medical Council, 2013). Our study used the KIDMED index as a measure of diet quality to test our hypothesis that flavonoids intake is related to higher diet quality in youth. All classes of flavonoids except flavones were positively associated with KIDMED index. Our results support a previous study which found an association between consuming the recommended servings of fruits and vegetables and significantly higher phytonutrient intake, including flavonoids intake, compared to participants who did not meet the recommended consumption levels .",951b370b-8c9a-4ac5-bc1d-99d59cb37ffb
21,discussion6," Other studies have found that diet quality, measured by the healthy-eating index (healthy eating index (HEI)), was positively associated with flavonoids intake and nearly all healthy-eating index components increased across quartiles of flavonoids intake (Sebastian et al., 2015b; Sebastian et al., 2015a).  A limitation of the present study is its cross-sectional design, which precludes drawing causal relationships. Furthermore, 24-hour recalls—and particularly a single day’s recall—have inherent limitations in the individual assessment of dietary intake due to daily variations in food intake. However, the sample size of 3,534 participants was large enough to characterize group intakes. Major strengths of our study are the nationwide population-based sample and interviewer-guided completion of validated questionnaires.  In conclusion, this study provides the first basic data for estimated flavonoids intake and their sources in Spanish youth.",21ca6375-60da-40f5-ae18-0fa111de4b74
22,discussion7," Fruits were the main source of dietary flavonoids. Flavan-3-ol was the major contributor for total flavonoids intake. Flavonoids intake was positively associated with good diet quality, indicated by higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet.
