0,background0," Previous studies have linked the Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean diet (MED)) with improved cardiometabolic health, showing preliminary evidence for a mediating role of the gut microbiome. We recently suggested the Green-Mediterranean (Green-Mediterranean diet (MED)) diet as an improved version of the healthy Mediterranean diet (MED) diet, with increased consumption of plant-based foods and reduced meat intake. Here, we investigated the effects of Mediterranean diet (MED) interventions on the gut microbiota and cardiometabolic markers, and the interplay between the two, during the initial weight loss phase of the DIRECT-PLUS trial.

1,methods0," Recruitment to the study  The DIRECT-PLUS (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03020186) was a prospectively registered clinical trial carried out in the Nuclear Research Center Negev, Dimona, Israel, a facility with an in-house dining room and medical clinic. The first subject was enrolled on January 28, 2017, and the last subject was enrolled on April 30, 2017. The trial was initiated and conducted in a single phase between May 2017 and November 2018.  Inclusion criteria were age > 30 years with abdominal obesity [waist circumference (WC): men > 102 cm, women > 88 cm] or dyslipidemia [triglycerides (TG) > 150mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) ≤ 40 mg/dL for men, ≤ 50 mg/dL for women]. Exclusion criteria are detailed in Additional file 1: Methods. The study was approved by the Soroka University Medical Centre Institutional Review Board. Participants provided written informed consent and received no compensation.",9f79a2a1-ed03-4013-a6be-c86bf1b8895b
2,methods1,"  Study design, randomization, and intervention  Design and intervention of the DIRECT-PLUS, as well as primary outcomes of the trial (defined as abdominal fat tissues, body weight, and waist circumference), were previously reported in detail [8, 9]. This report is focused on the analysis of the trials’ secondary outcomes, including gut microbiome profile, lipid profile, glycemic control, inflammatory state, and cardiometabolic risk.  All eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by gender and work site (to ensure equal workplace-related lifestyle features between groups), into one of the three intervention groups: healthy dietary guidelines (healthy dietary guidelines (HDG)), Mediterranean diet (MED), Green-Mediterranean diet (MED), all combined with physical activity accommodation (Additional file 2: Table S1).  The trial was conducted simultaneously, with all participants randomized and followed in a single phase.",bf56205f-3bdf-4d30-901c-5a3069c14bc7
3,methods2," Participants were aware of their assigned dietary group (open-label protocol). All participants were provided with a free gym membership and were guided to engage in moderate-intensity physical activity (Additional file 1: Methods).  Dietary guidance was provided as follows, with sessions identical in time and guidance across intervention groups to achieve equivalent intervention intensity: (1) healthy dietary guidelines (HDG) group: In addition to physical activity, participants received standard nutritional counseling based on the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health’s “The Nutrition Source,” a website sharing informed nutrition knowledge with the public, providing science-based guidance for healthy living. (2) Mediterranean diet (MED) group: In addition to physical activity, participants were instructed to adopt a calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet [2, 20].",9dd26039-f94c-4d77-9138-d1f379ec609b
4,methods3," The Mediterranean diet (MED) diet assigned was rich in vegetables, with poultry and fish replacing beef and lamb intake. The diet also included 28g/day of walnuts.  (3) Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) group: In addition to physical activity and the provision of 28g/day walnuts, the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet was further restricted in processed and red meat and was richer in plants and polyphenols. The participants were provided with 3–4 cups/day of green tea and 100g/day of frozen Wolffia globosa (Mankai strain) plant frozen cubes, as a green shake for dinner. Both the Mediterranean diet (MED) and green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diets were equally calorie-restricted (1500–1800kcal/day for men and 1200–1400kcal/day for women). Two hundred eighty-six subjects, all of which provided a fecal sample at baseline (97%), were included in the current analyses.  Details regarding the lifestyle interventions and motivation techniques are provided in Additional file 1: Methods.",a1c92b4c-1be6-492d-9d4c-37a8d9862b00
5,methods4,"  Anthropometric measurements and blood and stool sample collection  Measurements and sample collection were obtained at baseline and 6 months. Participants were weighed without shoes to the nearest 0.1 kg. Waist circumference was measured halfway between the last rib and the iliac crest to the nearest millimeter.  Two blood pressure (BP) measurements and pulse were recorded after resting, using an automatic BP monitor (Accutorr-4; Datascope). Blood pressure was calculated as the mean of the two measurements.  Blood samples were obtained after a 12-h fast, centrifuged, and stored at –80°C pending analyses; further information regarding the assays can be found in Additional file 1: Methods. The 10-year Framingham risk score (Framingham risk score (FRS)) was calculated based on gender, age, total cholesterol and HDLc levels, systolic BP and antihypertensive drug dependence, smoking status, and diabetes [21].",1979b68c-b8af-4c95-848b-061754c785d3
6,methods5,"  Fecal samples were collected at the study site, immediately frozen to –20°C for 1–3 days, then transferred to –80°C pending DNA extraction. Participants prescribed antibiotic therapy 2 months prior to the delivery of baseline fecal samples were excluded from all microbiome analyses. All blood biochemical assays were performed at the University of Leipzig, Germany. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed at Fondazione Edmund Mach, Italy. Fecal metagenomic sequencing was performed at CoreBiome, MN, USA.  16S rRNA sequencing and processing  To characterize the microbiome composition and to assess taxon abundance, fecal DNA from 546 fecal samples was extracted and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed by targeting the V3–V4 variable region of approximately 460-bp length using the bacterial primer pair 341F (5′ CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG 3′) and 806R (5′ GACTACNVGGGTWTCTAATCC 3′).",99447e26-25ff-4ff8-ba5d-9a95d0f358af
7,methods6," Paired-end sequencing reads were quality filtered, trimmed, de-noised, and merged using the DADA2 software version 1.14.0 [22]. To reject low-quality bases, forward reads were truncated to 280 bases and 25 bases were cropped from start. Reverse reads were truncated to 220 bases and 14 bases were cropped from start. Reads with a number of expected errors higher than two were discarded. Taxonomy was assigned to all identified amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) based on the SILVA rRNA reference database version 132 [23].  Shotgun metagenomics sequencing and processing  To characterize the microbiome’s functional capacity, a subset of 173 samples (31% of samples) underwent shotgun metagenomics.",043a85f2-77d6-41fd-93fb-8ec3dcbb65fa
8,methods7," Samples were collected from 90 participants as part of the pre-transplantation sampling of the DIRECT-PLUS autologous fecal microbiota transplantation study [13], with 31 samples from the healthy dietary guidelines (HDG) group, 69 from the Mediterranean diet (MED) group, and 73 from the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) group. DNA was extracted, sequenced, and normalized with an average depth of 15.4±2.6 million reads per sample (mean±standard deviation). DNA sequences were aligned using an accelerated version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to a curated database containing all representative genomes in RefSeq v86 [24]. Each input sequence was assigned the lowest common ancestor that was consistent across at least 80% of all reference sequences tied for best hit. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)) Orthology groups were observed directly using alignment against a gene database derived from the strain database used above.",9804bf78-4400-4006-ac65-36c6ac9bc142
9,methods8," Further details regarding DNA extraction and bioinformatics pipelines can be found in Additional file 1: Methods.  Dietary and adherence assessment  Assessment of nutritional intake and lifestyle habits was performed using self-reported food frequency questionnaires administered through a computer at baseline and after 6 months [25, 26]. Frequencies and portions of each individual food item were converted to average daily intake for each participant at each time point. Average daily energy intake was calculated by multiplying the frequency of consumption of each item by its caloric content and summing across all foods.  We then applied a Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) adherence score to measure the degree of adherence to the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) pattern. The adherence score was created based on the Mediterranean diet (MED) index by Willett et al. [27] and Trichopoulou et al. [28] and modified to suit the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) intervention.",0d7a6809-19b1-4f61-9ba4-55be59b59980
10,methods9," The adherence score was based on the intake of 9 items: walnuts, vegetables, processed meat, red meat, legumes, fruits, fish, green tea, and Mankai. Each component’s daily intake was normalized to the average daily intake (component intake in grams/total calories). For beneficial components (vegetables, legumes, fruit, walnuts, fish, green tea, and Mankai), individuals whose consumption was below the median were assigned a value of 0, and those whose consumption was at or above the median were assigned a value of 1. For red/processed meat intake, participants whose consumption was below the median were assigned a value of 1, and those at or above the median were assigned a value of 0. The final Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) score ranged from 0 (minimal adherence) to 9 (perfect adherence). ",c537d82c-795f-4a29-9a7c-251dfdf8f045
11,analysis0," All statistical analyses were performed in R v3.5.0. To assess the effect of dietary intervention on the composition of microbial communities, we applied permutational multivariate analysis of variance (permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)) on dissimilarity matrices of weighted UniFrac, using the adonis function from the R package vegan with 999 permutations [29]. To further evaluate the intervention effect on the microbiome composition over time, a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) model was applied with the interaction term of lifestyle intervention and group as independent variables (group X time), both for all groups together and for all three combinations of group pairs in a leave-one-out manner.",8c5dcd7d-222d-437a-8f1b-db66f1b87aab
12,analysis1,"  To quantify the percentage of variance explained by change in biomarkers and dietary variables on the gut microbiome’s composition, vectors of person-specific ASV changes were calculated for each ASV per individual as follows: Log2ASVt6ASVt0. Euclidian distances between the vectors were calculated, forming a distance matrix between all individuals. Next, a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) model was applied with the distance matrix as the dependent variable and percent change of biomarkers or dietary intake score as independent variables. All the P values from the permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. For all analyses stratified by core/non-core taxonomic features, the cutoff was defined as >50% prevalence [30].",35c56600-54ba-4c2e-952b-01471488437b
13,analysis2," To assess to what extent the intervention effect on the gut microbiome was convergent by nature, we generated a distance matrix between all subjects at 6 months, measured in weighted UniFrac and based on the 16S rRNA sequences. We next compared the observed differences between the mean within-group and between-group dissimilarities, to a null model generated by 106 permutations of random sample labeling. For per-feature analysis, we used the R package MaAsLin2 [31], with microbial features, taxonomic (16S rRNA) or pathways (shotgun sequencing) filtered, leaving features with a relative abundance of 10−5 in at least 5% of samples. To detect differences in changes of microbial features between groups over time, we built linear mixed models that include group, time, and their product term, with participant identifier as random. A significant P value for the product term indicates that over time changes in microbial features differ between groups.",363789ee-649e-465c-b29d-277e76a3711f
14,analysis3," For changes in biomarkers and specific microbial features, we determined the gradual dietary effect using Kendall’s tau-b correlation on the percent change in each biomarker across dietary groups and used generalized linear models to assess between-group differences. Dietary groups were considered a ranked variable, taking into account the increase in polyphenols and decrease in red and processed meat across the groups. To assess the correlation between specific taxa and biomarkers, the Spearman correlation test was used.  Assessing the mediatory effect of the microbiome, we first employed the meditation analysis suggested by Imai et al. [32] by the “mediation” package in R [33], with the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) score being the independent variable, PCo1 loading of the log2 change matrix accounting for mediation by microbiome composition change, and biomarkers being the dependent variables.  We next used the high-dimensional mediation analysis suggested by Zhang et al.",963e8cf4-6733-45ce-b9bb-f7ba18610d73

All multiple hypothesis testing was controlled for false discovery rate with a target of q < 0.25. ",9e81b351-d4ab-4a90-8d9d-00b93f39a318
16,results0," Baseline characteristics of participants and adherence rates in the DIRECT-PLUS trial  Two hundred ninety-four subjects were recruited in the DIRECT-PLUS weight-loss trial [8, 9] and randomized to one of the three lifestyle intervention groups.  Of those, 97% (n = 286) provided a fecal sample at baseline and were included in the current analyses. We measured body weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure and collected fasting blood samples, stool samples, and dietary data at baseline and month 6. Of the 546 stool samples profiled by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 173 were further profiled by shotgun metagenomic sequencing [13]. The mean age at baseline was 51 years; 88% were male, with a mean body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) of 31 kg/m2. Follow-up stool samples were obtained from 91% of the recruited participants.

18,results2," The three dietary arms lead to distinct changes in patterns across genera and microbial metabolic pathways  The Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet modifies the composition and function of the gut microbiome  Following 6 months of dieting, all three groups had undergone a significant change in microbiome composition, as assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing, though it appeared that the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) dieters exhibited the most prominent change, with a significant interaction between time (baseline to six months) and group (P of interaction = 0.01) as revealed by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on weighted UniFrac distances. To compare the compositional change between groups in a subject-specific manner, we created a log2 change ASV matrix between the two timepoints of each subject. The Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) group differed significantly in its change compared to the other two groups (PGreen-Mediterranean diet (MED) vs healthy dietary guidelines (HDG) = 0.",a4fc2065-25f0-4937-a76b-1da4478a4961

We next evaluated the effect of diet on change at the genus level of bacteria and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway modules. At month 6, different dietary interventions led to distinct changes across different phyla and functional groups (Fig. 1C, D).  The non-core microbiome as a driver of general composition change  In light of evidence linking the rare, person-specific, fraction of taxa in the microbiome profile, with sensitivity to dietary alterations [35], we next stratified the taxonomic features, as assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing, into “core” (ASVs > 50% prevalence) and “non-core” categories (ASVs < 50% prevalence).",a72f76cf-404c-4986-ae50-80543534f162

21,results5," This effect was even more dominant in the non-core fraction of the microbiome. Violin plots describe the distribution of 106 random permutations of the same measure, shuffling sample labels at each iteration  We next asked the question whether the dietary regimens modified the composition of the microbiome in a converging manner, i.e., whether changes in the microbiome compositions of participants resulted in the subject’s gut microbiomes being more similar to each other during the intervention, and to what extent the converging effect was affected by the dietary regimen. Comparing within-group and between-group dissimilarities to a null model, we observed that the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) dieters’ microbiome composition became more similar following the diet, as compared to the healthy dietary guidelines (HDG) and Mediterranean diet (MED) groups.",e002beca-1bad-43d9-bd87-bdfadafdfcf2
22,results6," Furthermore, performing the same comparison only on the non-core taxonomic features, it could be observed that convergence was more dominant in the non-core microbiome (Fig. 2C).  The Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet increases abundance of Prevotella and branched chain amino acids (BCAA) degrading pathways and decreases Bifidobacterium and branched chain amino acids (BCAA) biosynthesis pathways in the gut microbiome  We conducted per-feature testing by using MaAsLin2 linear mixed models [31] to identify microbial genera (by 16S rRNA) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) modules (by shotgun metagenomics) that were differentially changed by diet from baseline to month 6. We found that 21 genera responded to the dietary intervention differentially across groups (q of interaction < 0.25; Fig. 3A), including a stepwise increase in Prevotella across the three dietary groups, suggesting an effect induced by the graded dietary modifications across groups (Kendall tau; P = 0.",a0f98c52-f093-4776-93cf-6275d998f178
23,results7,"02), and a stepwise decrease in Bifidobacterium across the groups (Kendall tau; P < 0.001). These observations are in accordance with previous reports that linked vegetable-based diets [4] and adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MED) diet with increased Prevotella abundance [5] and linked greater weight loss [36] and a dietary pattern with improved glycemic index to lower abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. [37].Fig. 3 Mediterranean diet (MED) diets’ effects on microbial genera and metabolic pathways.

We also found that increased abundance of several genera from the Ruminococcaceae family was associated with weight loss, namely Ruminococcaceae UCG10 (Spearman’s rho = −0.28, FDR-corrected q < 0.",df63b5da-1861-4f0c-823c-36f02904ce2b
34,results18,"001), Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group (rho = −0.21, FDR-corrected q = 0.005), and Ruminococcaceae UCG3 (rho = −0.14, FDR-corrected q = 0.08). In addition, a reduction in Bifidobacterium and Dorea and an increase in genera from the Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families were associated with a reduction in Framingham risk score (Fig. 5B).  In a similar analysis performed on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) modules (assessed by shotgun sequencing), we identified significant associations of the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) adherence score with 10 microbial metabolic pathways (FDR-corrected q < 0.25). The leucine degradation pathway was positively correlated with Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) adherence (Spearman’s rho = −0.21, FDR-corrected q = 0.165). Reduction in the levels of the cysteine biosynthesis module was associated with reductions of body weight (Spearman’s rho = 0.33, FDR-corrected q = 0.02) and Framingham risk score (Spearman’s rho = 0.25, P = 0.",c86cc241-788d-4987-bd27-975b658cea8c
35,results19,"03), an observation that is consistent with a previous report demonstrating that high abundance of cysteine biosynthesis pathways is associated with unsuccessful weight loss [41] (Fig. 5C).  As we hypothesized that the dietary interventions, through modulation of the gut microbiome, exert their effects on cardiometabolic risk, we next sought to quantify the mediation effect. To this aim, we estimated the causal mediation effect as proposed by Imai et al. [32], using the first principal component of variation of the ASV change matrix as a summary measure of the gut microbiome composition. The association between the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet adherence and weight loss (12% mediation by taxonomic change), WC loss (10%), and Framingham risk score (FRS) reduction (18%) was found to be mediated by the change in the gut microbial composition.",33201e62-e93d-4f97-a661-7ba8eefd76c6
36,results20," When assessing the mediatory effect specific to the change of Green-Mediterranean diet (MED)-associated genera, Chemerin change was also found to be significantly mediated (Fig. 5B, D). In order to assess the mediatory effect of specific bacteria, we applied a high-dimensional mediation analysis [34]. Among the significant mediatory taxa, Bifidobacterium change was found to mediate the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) effect on weight loss (4%) and Ruminococcaceae UCG10 mediated the effect on Framingham risk score (FRS) reduction (1.3%). Changes in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway were a prominent mediator of weight loss (14.2%) and Framingham risk score (FRS) reduction (29.3%). ",066af24a-5985-4cb6-9888-a3d0049cd21f
37,discussion0," In the current study, we demonstrate the effect of Mediterranean diet (MED) and Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diets on the gut microbiome and determine the mediatory role of the microbiome in the associations between adherence to the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet and subsequent improvement in markers of cardiometabolic risk. We showed that the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet induced a prominent change in the gut microbiome composition, driven by the low-prevalent “non-core” fraction of the gut microbiome. This change was convergent by nature, with the taxonomic composition of the microbiome of individuals in the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) becoming more similar to each other.",e39cdb3c-40ce-4d8e-ab96-d9c68de4b769
38,discussion1," The different diets were also characterized by distinct taxonomic and functional changes, inducing a gradual increase in the abundance of Prevotella and branched chain amino acids (BCAA) degradation pathway concomitant with the increment of plant components in Mediterranean diet (MED) diets, and reductions in the abundance of Bifidobacterium and branched chain amino acids (BCAA) biosynthesis pathways when comparing Mediterranean diet (MED) diets vs. the control diet. The Mediterranean diet (MED) and Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diets improved cardiometabolic markers, including the Framingham risk score, body weight, blood pressure, HOMA-IR, and fasting plasma leptin. These beneficial changes in levels of cardiometabolic biomarkers were associated with a concurrent shift in the gut microbiome composition, estimated to mediate 12% of body-weight reduction and 18% of Framingham risk score reduction.  Our study has several limitations.",18174abe-ac5f-47ff-9e3b-4dd14f8f44a3
39,discussion2," The high proportion of male participants in the trial (88%) may limit the generalizability of our results to females. However, a previous report showed that, in western populations, gut microbiome composition is not associated with gender [42]. We addressed this limitation by employing gender stratification at the trial’s randomization. Furthermore, assessments of dietary intake and adherence to intervention regimes were based on self-reports. This limitation was addressed by the measurement of serum folic acid, a biomarker reflecting green leaf consumption [38], that increased across groups, by the use of previously validated dietary questionnaires [26, 43] and by focusing the analysis on individual-level dietary changes.",a48ffbab-ba68-44a5-810d-fe0cf5a9771e
40,discussion3," As only a subset of approximately one-third of the fecal samples were sequenced by shotgun metagenomics, with a relatively shallow coverage of 15 million reads per sample on average, this study was possibly underpowered to detect subtle functional differences between the gut microbiome of the three intervention groups.  The strengths of the study include the intense dietary instruction and multidisciplinary supervision, the simultaneous design, and the high retention rate.  Although the function and composition of the gut microbiome have dynamic features, with some changes observed on a daily scale, most of this variation is person-specific [44]. Moreover, while short-term dietary changes induce rapid and brief changes in microbiome composition, they tend to regress to the baseline personal microbiome structure [45].",2ce19d39-7296-4e78-bf88-02d4e5a2dd4b
41,discussion4," Long-term dietary habits however are considered a major determinant of gut microbiome composition, possibly due to consistent selective pressure induced by the diet and specific nutrients [46, 47]. A recent 1-year dietary trial reported that the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet showed a notable impact on the composition of the gut microbiome [48]. In the current analysis, we showed that long-term adherence to the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet prompted a greater composition change than the shift induced by the traditional Mediterranean diet (MED) diet. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) composition change was convergent by nature (i.e., the microbiome of the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) dieters became more similar to each other), corroborating the hypothesis that change was driven by a selective pressure [49].",3824377a-bc6e-4c9f-9237-f00d25b9f8cb
42,discussion5," Interestingly enough, convergence was likely driven by the rare, non-core fraction of the microbiome, presumably utilizing its pool of genetic resources given a change in environmental conditions [50].  The major determinants differentiating the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet from the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet are the supplementation of Mankai and green tea intake while reducing the consumption of red and processed meat.  Mankai was previously established as a high-quality substitute source for animal protein in a controlled test meal, with blood concentrations of essential amino acids being similar after Mankai intake to that of well-established animal and plant protein sources. As an exception, Mankai intake induced only a minor increase in circulating branched chain amino acids (BCAA) levels [51].",3a26e038-4592-448c-a401-1d425a55617a
43,discussion6," This observation is in accord with our current analysis, showing that the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet was associated with a reduction in the gut microbiomes’ capacity for branched chain amino acids (BCAA) biosynthesis and an increase in branched chain amino acids (BCAA) degradation pathways.  Furthermore, both Mankai and green tea were shown to be rich sources of polyphenols [16, 52, 53], with Mankai containing ~200 different phenolic metabolites. We previously reported that in a Mankai-supplemented artificial gut bioreactor, the functional profile of the gut microbiome shifted towards polyphenol degradation, e.g., degradation of the phenolic compounds protocatechuate and catechol [52]. Of note, in this study, we were not able to identify a differential effect of the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet on polyphenol-related pathways, possibly due to our power limitation mentioned above.",1c0186de-d717-47df-a836-8d514d058c41
44,discussion7,"  While the Mankai plant is considered fiber-rich, with a fiber content of ~25% [54], the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet lead to an increase in Prevotella abundance, a genus previously associated with high fiber intake [55] and vegetarian diets [47, 56]. Moreover, low abundance of Prevotella was shown to be a hallmark for the transition to a western lifestyle [56]. Previous studies have reached contradictory conclusions regarding the role of the dominant Prevotella species, Prevotella copri, in host metabolism. It was recently suggested that the abundance of Prevotella copri, as an indication of the preexisting, diet-related biosynthetic capacity of the gut microbiome, potentially attenuates the protective effect of the Mediterranean diet on cardiometabolic disease risk [5]. Furthermore, De Vadder et al.",365888c0-545b-4fae-aa94-a12567d167e2
45,discussion8," demonstrated that elevated Prevotella copri abundance is associated with improvements in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity by the production of succinate [57], while a study by Pedersen et al. suggested that Prevotella copri abundance is associated with insulin resistance, presumably due to increased branched chain amino acids (BCAA) biosynthesis [19]. Here, we report that across Mediterranean diet (MED) diets with a gradual increment in plant components, intervention intensity was associated with a reduction in branched chain amino acids (BCAA) biosynthesis, an increase in branched chain amino acids (BCAA) degradation pathways, and increased insulin sensitivity, measured as HOMA-IR. These findings support the hypothesis that Prevotella may not be beneficial or deleterious per se, but should be examined in light of other environmental and host-specific factors, requiring further investigations [5, 58].",f07b0c7b-9f62-44c2-bd3a-f95a6f5870c4
46,discussion9," The association of Bifidobacterium with cardiometabolic disease risk has also been inconsistent in previous studies, with an increase in Bifidobacterium abundance linked to both successful [59] and unsuccessful [36] weight loss. Our study demonstrated that in the setting of a plant-enriched (green) Mediterranean diet (MED) diet, weight loss is associated with a reduction in Bifidobacterium.  The associations between dietary patterns, the gut microbiome, and cardiometabolic health have been extensively evaluated in recent years [37, 60, 61], with several studies exploring microbial modifications related to beneficial diets, including the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet [4, 5, 48]. Our study links Mediterranean diet (MED) diets with several taxa, including the depletion of Blautia [48] and enrichment of Bacteroides [48], adding to the body of evidence by examining the effect of expanding the plant fraction of the diet while minimizing meat intake.",1e0b19fb-5ee3-4480-9e8d-43ae1d821162
47,discussion10," We showed that overall, the gut microbiome contributes a small but significant mediatory effect in the association between Mediterranean diet (MED) diets and weight and cardiometabolic risk reduction.  Conclusions  Mediterranean diet (MED) diet enriched in plant components and with decreased red and processed meat consumption (Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet) has extensive effects on the composition and function of the host gut microbiome, with the latter partially mediating the beneficial effects of the diet on cardiometabolic health. In future studies, the diet-microbiome-host interplay should be further explored and could guide novel beneficial modifications in known dietary patterns.
