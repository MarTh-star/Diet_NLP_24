0,methods0," 2.1. Population and Sampling  The Ministry of Health initiated the study as part of the National Lifestyle Improvement Program—”Efsharibari” (“Healthy is Possible”). One of the program’s goals is to achieve a reduction in sodium consumption. Therefore, the First Israeli National Sodium Survey was initiated so baseline levels of sodium as well as other electrolytes (such as potassium) can be evaluated before national intervention. The study took place at the institute of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Hypertension (institute of Endocrinology Metabolism and Hypertension (IEMH)), Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (TASMC)). This was a random sample composed of participants aged 20–65 years insured in three (out of four) Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs–health funds). Due to locating problems, there is an under-representation of Arabs (6.3% compared to 14.2% for the same age groups in the population).",e61f0946-bd8e-425b-bcba-6bd0f173fffb

There is under-representation of the 20–34 age group, and over-representation of the 55+ age group and over-representation of the Tel Aviv District [27].  The study was approved by each HMO’s own ethics committee (Helsinki) (approval had to be obtained from each committee separately), and signed informed consent was obtained from all participants. The sampling method was based on lists obtained from each of the three insurers and were divided into two age groups (25–44, 45–64) and two sex groups. More information on the original study and the sampling method can be seen elsewhere [27].

Study Flow and Protocol  The interviewers underwent three days of training in which all the survey contents were presented and practiced. In 2014, a pilot test was conducted that included examining the questionnaire and the anthropometric measurements planned for the study (no urine was collected at this point). The trained team made initial telephone contact with the respondents to obtain an agreement to participate and to be interviewed for the survey.",0c095d3b-f12d-4711-804b-ca13c5279def

The second interview was also conducted at the interviewee’s home and included filling out a general questionnaire and nutrition questionnaires, weight and height measurements, measurements of blood pressure, and pulse. A urine sample was collected from the 24-h urine collection. The interviewee received a gift voucher according to that agreed upon.  2.3.

Urinary creatinine, magnesium, sodium, potassium, calcium, protein, microalbumin, osmolarity, and specific gravity from the 24-h urine collection were measured by standard automated methods. Two-liter plastic containers for urine storage, urine cups, an insulated opaque carry bag, and disposable gloves were supplied. Urine collection started after the first morning urine void and continued for a full 24 h. The entire urine volume was collected and stored. The total urine volume was recorded. Whenever urine volume did not exceed 2 L, the container was first mixed and a sample then drawn by syringe and placed in a sterile urine collection cup.",1557abf6-9616-4382-84a1-3b0e71444f13

Each subject was requested to bring/show the medications/supplements to the interviewer (compliance at this stage was 92.2%). Although we a priori excluded subjects taking drugs that affect sodium or potassium excretion, we reexamined the lists of drugs which emerged during the interviews with the interviewees and may have either been missed in the computerized data files or modified due to medical needs after the date that extraction from these files were carried out to ensure no administration of these drugs since the time of recruitment to the study to the time of the actual enrollment of each subject he or she could have been prescribed with these drugs by their physician.",fcd89b38-8d94-4563-9a84-1e1b35bb9b4e

Data Collection: Main Outcome—Metabolic Syndrome and Its Components  Following the interview, the interviewers measured blood pressure and heart rate using an electronic monitor—digital blood pressure monitor, A&D Instruments Ltd., Abingdon UK, model UA-767 (compliance was 94.2%), according to a protocol based on recommendations of the American Heart Association (American Heart Association (AHA)). Blood pressure and pulse were measured on the right arm, while sitting, and each measurement was carried out twice, with a minute’s rest between measurements. The final value was the average of two measurements which comprise the minimum repetitions for BP measurement as indicated by the High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline in 2017 [29].",3f9db642-bcc1-4094-a7ff-361557e2c458
8,methods8," Where there was a difference of 10% or more between measurements of either systolic or diastolic pressure, a third measurement was carried out and considered as the “true” measurement.  Following blood pressure and pulse measurements, weight and height were also obtained, with compliance of 97.4%. According to a protocol, all measurements were carried out twice (and the average calculated) and included: standing height and weight. All measurements were carried out in light clothing without shoes. Weight measurements were carried out using a digital scale suitable for weighing 130 kg, with an accuracy of 0.5 kg.  Since the survey did not include blood testing, we built a likelihood model to estimate MS based on five components that were selected to approximate as much as possible the accepted and in consensus MS scoring system outlined by the ATP III guidelines [30].

Subjects’ General and Lifestyle Characteristics and Electrolytes Levels  Out of 594 subjects in the original survey, the analysis included 581 subjects with a complete potassium urine sample. The mean age was 46.3 ± 12.1 years, 54.2% of the sample were female, 74.2% were married (or declared living with a partner), and 22.2% identified themselves as current smokers (Table 1).  The mean 24 h excretion of potassium and sodium was 2818 ± 1417 and 3826 ± 1691 mg/day, respectively (mean sodium–potassium excretion ratio was 1.5 ± 0.64).",18a6b6d4-2853-421b-83ad-20879831e5f3
15,methods15," Adjusted to 24-h creatinine excretion (gram), the mean levels were 2270 ± 93 for potassium and 3130 ± 138 mg for sodium (Table 1). Below mean levels of potassium excretion [defined as 24 h potassium excretion (mg) adjusted to 24-h creatinine excretion < 2270 mg/gram] was found in 56% of the participants. Marital status, educational level, and socioeconomic status did not differ significantly across potassium excretion groups.  3.2. Subjects’ Health and Metabolic Characteristics  The mean MS score was 1.21 ± 1.18, which was contributed to by the rates of elevated blood pressure (50%), overweight/obesity (33%), hypertriglyceridemia (17%), diabetes (11%), and fatty liver (11%). According to the a priori selection criteria, 87 (18.5%) of the subjects were categorized with high likelihood for MS (as expressed by MS score ≥ 3), of whom 57 subjects had a score of “3”, 24 were classified having a score of “4”, and only 6 subjects were classified as having all MS criteria (a score of “5”).",85976efe-c6f4-43f0-97d8-600d483dfb2a

The percentage of subjects treated with medication indicative of components of the metabolic diagnoses (diabetes, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia) or with anti-platelet drugs was relatively low (<7%) (Table 2).  3.3. Associations of Potassium Excretion with the Metabolic Syndrome Components  When potassium excretion levels (adjusted to creatinine) were clustered into high vs. low levels (based on mean excretion levels), a negative association was found with mean MS score. This negative association indicated that the prevalence of MS likelihood was lower in subjects with higher than the mean potassium excretion as compared to subjects with lower than the mean potassium excretion (10.4% vs. 18.5%, p = 0.007). Sex modified the association between “MS-likelihood prevalence” and potassium excretion, as a significant “effect” was found in females only (p = 0.",fba91d73-30da-4157-82f8-b07194f7f7bf

Significant associations between single MS components and potassium excretion levels (above compared to below average) were found for overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 28.5 kg/m2) (24% compared to 39%), elevated blood pressure (≥130 mm for systolic or ≥85 mm for diastolic) (46.9% vs. 56.5%) and with fatty liver (7.5% vs. 13.5%) in the high vs. low potassium excretion groups, respectively (Table 3).  As shown in Figure 2 groups of MS (represented by MS scores) were compared based on their potassium excretion levels using one-way ANOVA test (Figure 2A) and box plots (Figure 2B). Mean potassium excretion levels (creatinine normalized) declined with higher calculated MS-likelihood scores (p between groups = 0.001) from 2.41 ± 0.99 among subjects with no MS criteria to 2.04 ± 0.74 among individuals with high-likelihood for MS (score ≥ 3) (p < 0.05; Figure 2A,B).",99cb32c7-5bfa-454f-800e-2f49860c9d0d
18,methods18," There was higher variability in potassium excretion in groups representing low MS-likelihood (scores = 0, 1, 2) than the group representing higher likelihood (MS score ≥ 3). Stratified by gender, the mean observed potassium excretion levels were inversely declining as the calculated MS-likelihood score increased, however, did not reach significance (data not shown). The exclusion of elevated blood pressure (≥130 mm for systolic or ≥85 mm for diastolic) from the MS model did not alter the association between potassium excretion and MS. Among normotensive subjects with high potassium excretion, the mean MS-likelihood score was 0.54 ± 0.96 compared to a score of 0.75 ± 1.1 in subjects with low excretion levels (p = 0.016).  3.4. The Relation of Potassium and Sodium Excretion and Intake with Other Metabolic Syndrome Variables  As indicated by Table 3, there was a low, yet significant, negative correlation between potassium excretion (adjusted to creatinine) and MS-likelihood score (r = −0.",d66b805f-9ee1-417b-910d-ec869191efd6
19,methods19,"161, p < 0.01). A closer look on the specific correlations between potassium excretion levels and MS components revealed negative correlations with the following: (1) BMI (as a continuous variable) and overweight/obesity (as a dichotomous variable) (r = −0.142 and r spearman = −0.162, p < 0.01); (2) measured elevated blood pressure (dichotomous) and with systolic and diastolic levels (r spearman = −0.108, p < 0.01; r =−0.095 and r = −0.143, p < 0.05); and (3) fatty liver diagnosis (dichotomous) (r spearman = −0.132, p < 0.01). In contrast, sodium excretion did not correlate with any of the MS components with the exception of positive correlations with mean systolic blood pressure and elevated measured blood pressure (among females). Also, none of these variables was related to potassium intake as assessed by food recall or FFQ (Table 3). However, sodium to potassium excretion ratio was positively correlated with MS-likelihood score and MS components as follows: obesity (r = 0.",8c2dcdb7-8126-46f0-8998-5bb0507a5a12

The Contribution of Food Groups to the Potassium Intake as Reported in 24-h Recalls  The main food groups contributing to potassium intake (therefore, for excretion) were: vegetables and fruits (mean intake of 514 g per day; 32% of the total intake), followed by the consumption of non-dairy protein (fish, meat, chicken, and eggs) which accounted for 17% of the total potassium intake. Dairy products and their substitutes (soy beverages, for instance) contributed 9% of the total intake, followed by grains other than bread and potatoes, and grains from bread (8% and 6%, respectively) (Figure 3).  3.6. Multivariate Analyses  The independent correlations between MS-likelihood score and creatinine adjusted potassium, sodium excretion, and sodium potassium ratio are summarized in Table 4.",9d793767-a166-46c4-8afa-7c5b0c535e0c
21,methods21," As reflected by the regression models, potassium excretion had a stronger negative correlation with MS-likelihood score than the correlation of sodium/potassium excretion ratio with MS score (standardized coefficient for potassium excretion/beta [B], −0.222 vs. B for sodium/potassium excretion ratio, 0.140; data not shown), whereas sodium excretion did not independently correlate with MS-likelihood score. Furthermore, the relative attributed variance in the MS-likelihood score explained by potassium excretion was the highest compared to the other models (R square change = 4.8%) (Table 4). Each ratio-increment of 1 in potassium/creatinine excretion, predicted a decrease of −0.285 in the calculated MS-likelihood score. These inverse potassium–MS associations were independent of other explanatory variables such as age, sex, physical activity, and caloric intake (Table 4). The results were not altered by the type of method of the regression (similar results for an “enter” method vs.",487cb8e3-98e9-4650-a5de-9871dbdafb07
22,methods22," the current stepwise method; data not shown).  Sensitivity analyses were performed each time with the exclusion of certain factors and suggested similar results (data not shown). In one analysis subjects taking drugs that might have an effect on potassium excretion were excluded (n = 11), no change occurred in this step (B = −0.220; 95% CI, −0.322, and −0.117) with a slightly lower R square of the model (13.6%). The same effect was seen for sodium/potassium excretion ratio (B = 0.233; 95% CI, 0.094, and 0.372). Further sensitivity analysis excluded all subjects taking drugs with “metabolic effect” (lipid, glucose, BP lowering and anticoagulant drugs) (n = 65). The results also remained consistent (B = −0.218; 95% CI, −0.318, and −0.118 for potassium excretion and B = 0.200; 95% CI, 0.064, and 0.336 for sodium-potassium excretion ratio).",41d81a3d-1123-4cfe-b6c1-2729481538be
23,methods23," The last sensitivity analysis was performed with the exclusion of all subjects who reported a non-normal activity level on urine collection day (n = 164). This analysis strengthened the quality of the prediction model for both potassium excretion and sodium–potassium excretion ratio (R square of 17.2% and 16.1%, respectively). Both potassium excretion and sodium/potassium excretion ratio still independently predicted the change in MS-likelihood score (B−0.217; 95% CI, −0.337, −0.096 and B = 0.232; 95% CI, 0.060, and 0.404). Sodium excretion did not correlate with MS-likelihood score in all sensitivity analyses.  Finally, in a multivariate logistic regression, the odds for high MS-likelihood score (a score ≥ 3 vs. <3) were 0.402 (60%) lower in those with high vs. low potassium excretion (≥mean level vs. <mean levels) (stepwise regression adjusted for age, physical activity, sex, and caloric intake) (Figure 4).  4.",9e4b8294-2621-4fcc-91b7-39c0650f7841
24,methods24," Discussion  The present study assessed for the first time the association between 24-h potassium excretion as compared to potassium intake, sodium excretion, and MS likelihood and its components in a representative sample of adult Israelis. Several new findings emerged from our national survey: (1) 24-h potassium excretion (normalized to creatinine) was inversely associated with MS likelihood and significantly correlated with its specific components, independent of age, sex, physical activity, and caloric intake; (2) potassium excretion, but not sodium excretion, was a significant predictor of MS likelihood and its components and this association was not weakened by the exclusion of the well-recognized potassium or sodium relation with elevated blood pressure from the calculation; (3) whereas the 24-h potassium excretion was associated with MS and its components, this linkage could not be found between MS and potassium intake as assessed by either 24-h recall or FFQ,",cd052b8b-5e82-42ce-bd80-3311f02db124
25,methods25," likely reflecting the limitations of dietary questionnaires relative to actual measurements.  In the past few years several reports, mainly from Eastern Asia have described the possible linkage of potassium excretion and MS likelihood based on cross-sectional analyses [20,35,36,37]. However, reflected by our MS-likelihood model, to our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting a possible “role” of potassium in the MS likelihood assessed by 24-h potassium excretion. In contrast to our study, a recent cross-sectional analysis conducted in 1906 Chinese participants showed that the MS was not related to potassium excretion, but rather to sodium excretion [36] or sodium to potassium excretion ratio [35]. In a recent meta-analysis based on cross-sectional studies, MS prevalence was estimated at 20% and inversely associated with potassium intake (n = 3 studies) or serum levels, (n = 1), with a pooled OR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.50–0.97)] [20].",d1d6e0e2-34e8-4cc4-ba7c-2f2a26eb837c
26,methods26," Interestingly, we have shown that lower potassium excretion is associated with MS prevalence and was independent of the association between potassium and blood pressure, as there was a univariate relation with other MS components. Lower potassium and sodium to potassium excretion ratio in our cohort were associated with obesity and fatty liver. In one Chinese study, sodium/potassium excretion ratio was found to be associated with central obesity [35]; however, this was attributed to sodium rather than potassium excretion [36].  The dietary food groups from which potassium intake mainly derived in the present report were vegetables and fruits, followed by poultry and fish, dairy products, and grains (Figure 3). The consumption of these potassium-containing foods is in accord with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary guidelines to treat hypertension [38], one of the MS components.",b7daaac6-5ada-4a65-8093-f1754fcdfc41
27,methods27," The inverse and caloric independent association of potassium excretion (as a better proxy for intake) with MS found in the current study may legitimize such dietary consumption with respect to MS prevention. However, further prognostic studies relating potassium excretion with its intake and with MS incidence are needed to confirm this hypothesis-generating observation.  The current study has several limitations. The first is the model we rely on, a post hoc approximation but not a precise application of the well-defined MS components. As such there may be underrepresentation of people with abdominal obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 was chosen as a proxy of central obesity). Moreover, with the inclusion of diabetes in the components of MS, but not impaired glucose levels, prediabetic subjects are not represented. This likely explains the relatively low prevalence of MS likelihood in our study (≈11%) as the prevalence of subjects with impaired fasting glucose in obesity is sizable.",30699dd4-06f2-4ae0-878a-b1046dae3389
28,methods28," Insulin per se can affect urinary potassium excretion via multiple mechanisms [39]. However, the sensitivity analysis we performed excluding all subjects taking any medications with “metabolic effect”, including diabetes medications (n = 17), showed that our findings were not appreciably affected. The results in our analysis, as in any observational study, could be attributed to residual confounding. The limited explained 15% variance in MS predicted by potassium excretion adjusted to other variables is consistent with the concept that other essential factors are related to the MS.",228c77cf-12a1-4167-a7c3-51b10d700755
29,methods29,"  The advantages of our study include the relatively high internal validity of our methodology contributed by the following: (1) reliance on 24-h excretion [unlike most studies on the topic reporting intake [20,37,40,41,42]]; (2) the rigorous exclusion of participants prescribed with medications possibly interfering potassium flux in the body; and (3) several sensitivity analyses supporting the observed role of potassium in MS likelihood. Regarding external validity, to the best of our knowledge, it is also the first study performed in a non-Asian population where nutritional intake is closer to a westernized pattern.  5. Conclusions  This is the first study to show on a national level that 24-h potassium excretion was associated with MS likelihood and its components, including obesity, elevated blood pressure, and fatty liver. Lower potassium excretion was linked to a higher MS-likelihood score, independent of age, sex, physical activity, and caloric intake.",41c68a5b-ea49-4d07-83fe-bd08ebfc46cf
