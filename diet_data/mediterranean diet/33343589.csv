The number of diabetic patients worldwide has more than doubled since 1980 and is predicted to reach 700 million adults by 2045 [2]. The global prevalence of diabetes among adults rose from 4.",fb8619fe-7ebc-4b07-bba8-3ab39250f9fc
3,conclusion1,"7% in 2000 to 8.5% in 2014 [1, 3]. These findings are critical since diabetes is a well-established cardiovascular risk factor [1]. The exponential increase of diabetes prevalence is also accompanied by a serious financial burden [1]. According to the International Diabetes Federation (International Diabetes Federation (IDF)), the healthcare expenditure on diabetes in Europe five years ago was 2,198 euros per person per year [4].  At present, there is no curative treatment, making primary prevention the cornerstone of the global response to the disease [1]. Although genetic, biological, and environmental factors (in particular lifestyle interventions, including medical nutrition therapy, limited alcohol intake, regular physical activity, etc.) are decisive in the onset and development of diabetes, cognitive and psychosocial management are also crucial in both preventing the disease and improving the daily life of diabetic patients [1, 5].",3c0529dc-9ddc-4778-8e73-a6a23bb7aa40
4,conclusion2,"  In cognitive-behavioral therapy, irrational beliefs are considered as the primary cause of psychopathological conditions, namely anxiety, depression, eating problems (including overeating, unhealthy diet, obesity, etc.), and alcohol overconsumption [6]. Specifically, irrational beliefs derive from a core process of absolutist thinking and pessimism (e.g., “I am a boring person, nobody wants to talk to me”) which inevitably contribute to the development of psychopathologic conditions, including stress and extreme sadness. Irrational coping strategies may lead to irrational behavioral responses, such as misuse of alcohol and eating problems (e.g., “I will drink a few glasses of whisky to make me feel less shy and more comfortable with others”), which may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality [7-10].",7058218a-c93d-440b-ba02-aec1ac4d5bdb
5,conclusion3," Anxiety and depression have also been associated with certain eating habits, such as significantly less fruit, vegetable, and fish intake, and increased sugar consumption [10]. Depression has also been associated with low consumption of folic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, folate, cobalamin, zinc, magnesium, B-group vitamins, and culinary fat, whereas anxiety has been associated with lower consumption of docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), one of the ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) [11, 12]. High amounts of fat and soft drinks and high consumption of red meat, sweets, and fried foods may result in the deterioration of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity raising the risk of diabetes, whereas whole grains, nuts, legumes, fruits, vegetables, micronutrients, and low alcohol intake act protectively [13-15].",4cd061ea-09b3-404d-8838-50336a0b372f
6,conclusion4,"  Although the biological association of anxiety and depression in type 2 diabetes has been proposed by a significant number of studies, the mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear [16]. Besides, the literature on anxiety, depression, and nutrition is relatively limited. To date, no studies have examined the association between irrational beliefs and dietary habits, and how their synergistic role may contribute to the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the association between irrational beliefs and dietary habits, as well as the combined role of irrational beliefs and the Mediterranean diet in the 10-year incidence of type 2 diabetes.  2 Methods  2.1 Study design  The ATTICA study is a population-based, prospective survey (2002-2012) which was conducted in the province of Attica, in Greece.",4d8268f2-dc5b-4ae5-bf82-61069e7f4d64
7,conclusion5," Briefly, 3,042 adults (18-89 years old, 49% men, 73% participation rate) without any clinical evidence of cardiovascular diseases, other atherosclerotic impairments, or chronic viral infections agreed to provide blood samples for biochemical and genetic analyses in addition to the requested sociodemographic, lifestyle, and medical information, including a psychological evaluation.  Setting  The study was conducted in the greater metropolitan Athens area (including 78% urban and 22% rural regions) during 2001-2002. The participant’s examination was performed using face-to-face interviews, in the individual’s home or workplace, by trained personnel (cardiologists, general practitioners, dieticians and nurses, as well as psychiatrists/psychologists).  2.2 Patient sample  Of the initially enrolled 3,042 participants, a subsample of 853 participants (453 men (45 ± 13 years) and 400 women (44 ± 18 years)) agreed to participate in the psychological evaluation.",6727a5e0-9bf3-4aa6-938d-bef12f2f4ecf
8,conclusion6," This subsample was representative of the total study sample since there were no differences in sex and age distribution between the studied sample and the overall study population (all p-values >0.4).  2.3 Bioethics  The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics (#017/1.5.2001) Committee. All participants were informed about the aims and procedures and agreed to participate by providing written consent.  2.4 Sociodemographic and lifestyle measurements at baseline  Sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics assessed included age, sex, educational level, mean annual income during the past three years, dietary habits, the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, physical activity status, and smoking habits.",b6778385-ac62-4863-ab6a-1c000f82dc9f
9,conclusion7," Socioeconomic status (Socioeconomic status (SES)) was classified into three groups (tertiles; low, medium, and high) according to the Socioeconomic status (SES) categorization already used, taking into account education level and mean annual income in the preceding three years [17]. Current smokers were classified as individuals who had smoked at least one cigarette per day during the previous year, former smokers were defined as those who had stopped smoking more than 1 year ago, and the rest were classified as “never-smokers”.  Dietary habits were recorded using a validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)), the EPIC-Greek questionnaire, which was kindly provided by the Unit of Nutrition of Athens University Medical School, and asked participants to recall and report the average weekly or daily intake of food items during the past year [18].",19f3885d-7cc9-4606-a725-fdecfa532d6a
10,conclusion8," The questionnaire recorded the usual dietary intake of 156 foods and beverages commonly consumed in Greece, with seven non-overlapping response categories. Photographs assisted the responders to define the portion sizes in several foods that were included in the questionnaire. In particular, consumption of non-refined cereals and products (like whole-grain bread, pasta, rice, etc.), vegetables, legumes, fruit, dairy products (like cheese, yogurt, milk), nuts, potatoes, eggs, sweets, fish, poultry, red meat and meat products, use of olive oil in cooking, as well as coffee, tea, and alcohol drinking were measured as an average per week during the past year. The frequency of consumption was quantified in terms of the number of times per month a food item was consumed in small, medium, or large portion sizes.  Alcohol consumption was recorded as daily ethanol intake of 100 ml wineglasses adjusted for 12% ethanol concentration.",0bf21b05-eaaf-4271-b26f-0de5c7700324
11,conclusion9," Moreover, a diet score, called MedDietScore, was calculated based on the reported dietary habits to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet for each participant [18]. In particular, for the consumption of items presumed to be “close” to this pattern (i.e., those consumed daily or more frequently than 4 servings per week) we assigned the score 0 when someone reported no consumption, score 1 for 1 to 4 times per month, score 2 for 5 to 8 times per month, score 3 for 9 to 12 times per month, score 4 for 13 to 18 times per month and score 5 for more than 18 times per month. For the consumption of food items presumed to be outside of this diet (like meat and meat products) we assigned the scores on a reverse scale (i.e., 0 when a participant reported almost daily consumption and 5 for rare or no consumption).",359dac78-c5a8-4c95-b529-026cfd970f0b
12,conclusion10," Specifically for alcohol, we assigned score 5 for the consumption of fewer than 3 wineglasses per day, score 0 for the consumption of more than 7 wineglasses per day and scores 1 to 4 for the consumption of 3, 4-5, 6, and 7 wineglasses per day. Higher values (range 0-55) of this special diet score mentioned above indicate good adherence to the Mediterranean diet.  A short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) was used to assess physical activity. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used as an index of weekly energy expenditure using frequency (times per week), duration (in minutes per time), and intensity of sports or other habits related to physical activity (in expended calories per time) [19]. Participants who did not report any physical activities were defined as sedentary and the rest as physically active.  2.",9a5e9489-1f06-4861-8219-d475d9cc2c9b
13,conclusion11,"5 Clinical and biochemical evaluation at baseline  Blood samples were collected from the antecubital vein at between 8 to 10 am in a sitting position after 12 hours of fasting and alcohol abstinence. Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus was based on the criteria of the American Diabetes Association [20]; i.e., participants who had fasting blood glucose >125 mg/dl during the examination or reported the use of antidiabetic medication were defined as having diabetes. Blood glucose levels (mg/dl) were measured with a Beckman Glucose Analyzer (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA, USA). Serum insulin concentrations were assayed using radioimmunoassay (RIA100, Pharmacia Co., Erlangen, Germany). Moreover, obesity was defined as body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) greater than 29.9 kg/ m2 according to WHO criteria [21]. Waist and hip circumferences (in cm) were also measured; and waist-to-hip (WH) and waist-to-height (WHt) ratios were calculated. WH ratio was considered abnormal if >0.",fe9e31b2-4c90-4347-b5b2-2aed75634770
14,conclusion12,"8 for women and >1 for men, whereas WHt ratio was considered abnormal if >0.5 for both sexes. Regarding other clinical characteristics, arterial blood pressure (3 recordings) was measured at the end of the physical examination with the subject in a sitting position after at least 30 minutes at rest. Participants whose average blood pressure levels were ≥140/90 mmHg and who were taking antihypertensive medication were classified as being hypertensive. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as total cholesterol levels >200 mg/dl or the use of lipid-lowering agents. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation of cholesterol levels did not exceed 9%. The metabolic syndrome was defined according to ATP III criteria [22].  2.6 Psychological evaluation at baseline  Irrational beliefs were assessed at baseline using the Irrational Beliefs Inventory (Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI)), a brief self-report measure based on the work of Ellis [23].",7a68bf2e-ba6f-49d5-bc31-a7784c161b7b
15,conclusion13," The inventory consists of 11 statements, each reflecting one irrational belief, including, worrying, rigidity, need for approval, problem avoidance, and emotional irresponsibility [24]. Each item is followed by a 9-point bipolar scale ranging from disagree to agree. The scales are added up to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 88 (the higher the score, the more irrational the beliefs).  The Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI) was developed as an instrument to assess the association between endorsement of irrational beliefs and various aspects of maladaptive emotion and behavior that have been developed within Ellis’s theoretical and applied model that views irrational beliefs as maladaptive [23]. For this study, the Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI) score was subdivided into 3 categories with the 1st tertile corresponding to the lowest Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI) scores (<48, i.e.",5612c8ce-6a2c-460a-a871-4455cafdfe00
16,conclusion14,", less irrational beliefs), the 2nd to the moderate Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI) scores (48-56) and the 3rd to the highest Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI) scores (>56, i.e., frequent irrational beliefs).  Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the validated Greek translation of the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (Zung Self Rating Depression Scale (ZDRS)). The time window was the preceding 4-week period before administration. The Zung Self Rating Depression Scale (ZDRS) total score range is 20-80, with higher score values indicating more severe depression symptoms [25]. Based on the validated Zung Self Rating Depression Scale (ZDRS) cut-off score for the Greek population, we applied a cut-off score of 45 to dichotomize the study cohort into participants with and without clinically relevant depressive symptomatology [26].",9550b557-6c22-49ec-8878-2293c52478a8
17,conclusion15,"  Anxiety levels were assessed using the validated Greek translation of the State Anxiety subscale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)) [27]. The total score of the 20-item State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) ranges from 20 to 80, with higher score values indicating more severe anxiety symptoms [25]. In the context of this study, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score was used as a continuous variable, since cut-off scores for the adult Greek population require further validation [27].  2.7 10-year follow-up examination  The ATTICA study 10-year follow-up was performed during 2011-2012. Of the initially enrolled 3,042 participants at baseline, a 10-year follow-up was achieved in 2,583 participants (85% participation rate; of those lost to follow-up, n = 224 could not be traced due to missing contact information and n = 235 stopped participating).",2192598f-c45e-4238-b03b-1a8d615854ba
18,conclusion16," After excluding patients diagnosed with diabetes at baseline examination (n = 210), and those that did not attend the psychological examination (n = 1,528), the working sample consisted of n = 845 participants. Diagnosis of diabetes at follow-up examination was based on the American Diabetes Association criteria mentioned above [20].  No differences were found regarding the distribution of sex, years of education, family history of diabetes, physical activity status, metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia status, body mass index (BMI), abnormal waist-tohip and waist-to-height ratio, and energy intake (all p-values >0.05). Some significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between participants for whom information about 10-year diabetes status was available and the rest; in particular, compared to those lost to follow-up, participants had a slightly higher prevalence of hypertension (30% vs. 26%, p = 0.036), smoking habits (58% vs. 54%, p = 0.",6b16cb03-7fc6-471b-971d-7d68301f4e57

20,conclusion18," Associations between categorical variables were tested using the chi-squared test. Comparisons of mean values of normally distributed variables between those who developed diabetes and the rest of the participants were performed using Student’s t-test, after controlling for equality of variances using Levene’s test.  For continuous variables that were not distributed normally (e.g., years of school) the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test was applied to evaluate differences in the distribution of the skewed variables. Continuous variables were tested for normality using P-P plots. Associations between normally distributed variables and Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI) tertiles were evaluated through a one-way analysis of variance (a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)). For non-normally distributed variables, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Associations between categorical variables and Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI) tertiles were assessed using the chi-squared test.",c6888843-81ac-44a7-86dc-d6149a6ef335
21,conclusion19," Since the exact time of the event (i.e., development of diabetes) was unknown, the relative risks of developing the disease during the 10-year follow-up period were estimated using the odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) through stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. Interactions between sex and other covariates were tested in all steps, and when significant, they remained in the final model.  The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was applied to evaluate models’ goodness-of-fit. The -2 log-likelihood ratio of the initial vs. the final model was also calculated to evaluate the models’ performance (the lower the better). All known confounders were included in the models after testing for collinearity. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)) version 25 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) software was used for all statistical calculations.  3 Results  3.",678ecaae-704a-4450-aba1-fc8bb87fc1ea

33,conclusion38,"44 times higher likelihood of developing diabetes than participants who highly adhered to the Mediterranean diet and had low levels of Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI), underlying the combined harmful effect of negative thinking patterns and unhealthy dietary habits on the development of type 2 diabetes.  As people’s irrational beliefs and attitudes are usually considered as precursors of negative emotions, like depression and anxiety, the additive effect of these psychological disorders was further evaluated. As shown in Table 1, participants in the highest tertile on the Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI) scale also had higher levels of depression (p < 0.001) and anxiety (p < 0.001) than those in the lowest tertile. When the analysis was focused on those in the upper 50 percentile of the depression score (i.e., Zung Self Rating Depression Scale (ZDRS) > 35) it was observed that participants in the 3rd Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI) tertile were 1.",113db220-26b2-4273-b853-eece7aa0fe7e

Furthermore, when the analysis was focused on participants in the lowest 50 percentile (i.e., Zung Self Rating Depression Scale (ZDRS) ≤ 35), no association between Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI) score and diabetes incidence was observed (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.43-2.91). Analysis then focused on participants in the upper 50 percentile of the anxiety score (i.e., State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) > 40).

35,conclusion40,"83) when the analysis was focused on those in the lowest anxiety score 50 percentile (i.e., State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) ≤ 40).  4 Discussion  In this study, lifestyle and clinical profile of people with irrational beliefs and their relationship with the 10-year diabetes incidence were explored. It was revealed that people who reported more irrational beliefs had a lower Socioeconomic status (SES), with less education and income, had more mental and physical health conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression, high body mass index (BMI), and obesity), practiced unhealthier dietary habits, and experienced a higher 10-year risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, people reporting fewer irrational beliefs showed a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, consumed more vegetables and less red meat and its products, and drunk fewer soft drinks.  This is the first study to demonstrate that irrational beliefs contribute to the 10-year incidence of type 2 diabetes.",b8a137b8-c59a-4598-b422-4293a8c485b9
36,conclusion41," Participants who strongly pursued irrational beliefs and had a low adherence to the Mediterranean diet were 37% more likely to develop diabetes than those with a low level of irrational beliefs status and high adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Finally, participants who eventually developed type 2 diabetes during the 10-year follow-up period had an 11.8% higher irrational beliefs score at baseline, higher body mass index (BMI), abnormal WH and WHt ratios, lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet, history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome than those who did not develop diabetes. Despite the limitations of this work inherent in its observational nature, it carries significant public health messages, since it suggests, for the first time in the literature, that irrational beliefs play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes in combination with unhealthy dietary patterns and non-adherence to the Mediterranean diet.",5a040c00-684e-4565-81e6-c21bdf7d9ff6
37,conclusion42,"  Type 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder caused by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors [28]. Depressed and anxious individuals are at risk of developing diabetes and other clinical outcomes because of the increased risk of adopting an unhealthy lifestyle behavior, including physical inactivity, smoking, and consumption of high-fat foods [29]. Depression and chronic anxiety contribute to the impairment of a certain neuroendocrine system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)) axis, and the sympathetic nervous system; they may also cause an increase in inflammatory and platelet aggregation responses, while they are associated with insulin resistance contributing to elevated blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels (poor glycemic control) and an increased risk of metabolic complications [29].  Irrational beliefs are considered as negative and absolutistic ways of thinking about oneself, others, and society.",7fafd94b-46ff-4312-aa0f-aea1325f44c5
38,conclusion43," Such beliefs may derive from early experiences and core beliefs during infancy, and they can reappear during the lifespan [6, 7]. They inevitably lead to adverse psychological outcomes (e.g., anxiety or depression) and in turn to irrational coping strategies (e.g., unhealthy nutrition, sedentary life, etc.) and eventually to negative health outcomes [7]. Based on our findings, we believe that people with a high irrational beliefs score adopt, either directly or through depression and anxiety, unhealthy dietary patterns, including high consumption of red meat and soft drinks combined with reduced intake of vegetables and olive oil. Therefore, these individuals are prone to weight gain and thereby have a high likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes and other clinical complications.",3970a1a6-d6dc-4ef2-84ab-4dd017c4093d
39,conclusion44," Thus, we attempted to explore further psychological pathways and theories that link irrational beliefs (in addition to anxiety and emotional disorders) with diabetes and which may explain how unhealthy eating habits mediate this relationship before referring to bio-neurological mechanisms.  According to Bruch (1974) and the psychosomatic theory of eating behavior, some people interpret the sensation of sadness, emptiness, and loneliness, which are common in maladaptive thoughts and mental disorders, as similar to hunger [30]. Hence, food is used as a form of emotional comfort and an “easy strategy” to cope with distress and attain positive reinforcement [7, 30, 31]. Also, obese individuals appear to consume a higher proportion of fat [30], which may explain why participants with high irrational beliefs in our study consumed slightly more fat.",0bd474e0-9a62-485f-a88c-201e394907d6
40,conclusion45," The combination of irrational beliefs (and high rates of mental health problems), non-compliance with the Mediterranean diet, and attitude towards unhealthy food patterns may lead to type 2 diabetes through biochemical mechanisms. Soft drinks raise blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, and body mass index (BMI), whereas high amounts of red meat contribute to insulin resistance [32, 33]. Furthermore, the fewer fruit and vegetables consumed the lower their protective role in the provision of nutrients, fibers, and antioxidants against the development of diabetes [34].  In particular, these unhealthy dietary habits and the subsequent development of obesity may be related to the deficiency of insulin secretion caused by impairment in pancreatic β-cell function when untreated, affects glucose metabolism, and results in insulin resistance, eventually leading to type 2 diabetes [35, 36].",877c05f7-727e-436b-984c-2bde7d7ce46b
41,conclusion46," Additionally, in line with our results, several studies have shown that type 2 diabetes frequently coexists with other metabolic abnormalities, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome, which are also associated with central obesity and insulin resistance [37].  Previous studies have shown that irrational beliefs are associated with increased inflammatory processes, hypertension, and insomnia [38-40]. To the best of our knowledge, the role of irrational beliefs in predicting the risk of diabetes has been investigated by a sole cross-sectional study, showing that irrational beliefs are associated with increased diabetes risk [41].  However, our study is the first longitudinal study which systematically examined cognitive irrationality and how it affects psychological, behavioral, and clinical aspects of life according to cognitive behavioral theory.",5692ccfc-17a0-4300-9134-714fb08d2ff4
42,conclusion47," We examined the role of irrational beliefs on type 2 diabetes risk because irrational beliefs can lead to unfavorable behavioral responses such as unhealthy nutrition affecting the human metabolic profile. Since dietary habits are linked to type 2 diabetes, irrational beliefs could be strongly associated with diabetes as well.  The purpose of our study was to explore the underlying cognitive, emotional, and behavioral mechanisms that contribute to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Even though we recognize the role of genetics, neurobiology, and environment, their involvement in diabetes development is still poorly understood. There is a need for specific and modifiable factors of this costly chronic disease that has a meaningful emotional burden. By intervening and reframing irrational beliefs, individuals can better control their feelings before they become maladaptive and start practicing unhealthy lifestyle patterns to deal with their problems under an irrational perspective.",f14efc8c-4e1e-4832-9db6-a56b094349b5
43,conclusion48," Mental health literacy (i.e. knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders) is a key factor in this process. Irrational beliefs are the first stage before the development of a mental disorder and finally a physical illness. If we manage to educate people to recognize false and unhelpful thoughts during counseling or therapy, we may be able to prevent negative psychological, behavioral, and physical outcomes, including anxiety, depression, unhealthy eating habits, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.  5 Limitations  Person-time and incidence rates could not be calculated reliably because the exact date of diabetes development was not available in the data; the date of diagnosis was included instead.",d3f5b725-c2ad-43bf-a406-06cd67379ead
44,conclusion49," Participants with baseline cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), for whom information about diabetes status was not available in the data of the 10-year follow-up, were excluded from the current analysis along with 1,347 participants for whom diabetes status was not known at baseline. This may have influenced diabetes incidence.  As for diabetes determinants, relative risks were estimated by odds ratios through multiple logistic regression analysis, which may overestimate the actual relative risk. However, it has been reported that for low-prevalence diseases, odds ratio is an accurate estimate of the relative risk [42]. Another issue is that associations with disease incidence were based entirely on baseline information, but many lifestyle factors such as energy intake, physical activity, and smoking status may have changed during the long 10-year period.",93e1e087-0ad4-4de2-b508-90ac33dcf710
45,conclusion50," The study sample likely represents a limitation of the current work, although no differences were observed regarding age, sex distribution, and Socioeconomic status (SES) level between participants who were psychologically evaluated and the rest of the ATTICA study population. The few significant, but meaningless differences observed in baseline characteristics between those who participated in the 10-year follow-up and the rest cannot be caused by a reporting bias. Finally, we did not control for genetic causal factors apart from family history of diabetes.  6 Conclusions  Given that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is rising globally, the population is aging at higher rates, and negative beliefs seem to be more frequent because of the rapid and demanding pace of life and perhaps the growth of technology, the need to promote healthier eating, especially in this group of people, is vital in diabetes prevention.",be1199b2-a254-4f30-90dc-f57e712efe4e
46,conclusion51," Change of lifestyle behavior such as diet is not easy and may interact with several factors such as belief system and emotional state.  It will be crucial to achieve coordination among healthcare professionals by assessing irrational beliefs and providing personalized consultation to high-risk individuals including those with cognitive bias, emotional disturbance, and other clinical conditions, to intervene as early as possible in the initial stages of diabetes development.
