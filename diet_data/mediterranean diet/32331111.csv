0,methods0," 2.1. Design  The ATTICA study is a population-based, prospective survey (2002–2012) that was carried out in the province of Attica, in Greece. In total, 3042 adults (18–89 years old, 49% men (73% participation rate)) with no clinical evidence of cardiovascular diseases, other atherosclerotic diseases or chronic viral infections agreed to give blood samples for biochemical and genetic analyses, in addition to their socio-demographic, lifestyle and medical details, including a psychological assessment.  2.2. Setting  The study was conducted in the greater metropolitan Athens area (including 78% urban regions and 22% rural regions) during the years ranging from 2001–2002. Each participant was interviewed/examined face-to-face, in their home or place of work, by qualified professionals (cardiologists, general practitioners, dieticians and nurses, as well as psychiatrists/psychologists).  2.3.",6f74de9c-ab0b-47a8-b2c7-7cdb2eec498d
1,methods1," Sample  Of the initially enrolled 3042 participants, a sub-sample of 853 participants (453 men (45 ± 13 years) and 400 women (44 ± 18 years)) agreed to participate in the psychological evaluation within this study. This sub-sample is representative of the total study sample, and there were no differences in sex and age distribution between the studied sample and the overall study population (all p-values > 0.4).  2.4. Bioethics  The Institutional Ethics (#017/1.5.2001) committee approved the study and all participants were informed about the aims and procedures and agreed to participate, providing written consent.  2.5. Baseline Measurements  2.5.1. Socio-Demographic and Lifestyle  The socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics examined included age, sex, educational attainment and mean annual income during the past three years, dietary habits, physical activity status and smoking habits.",79679421-9372-4b8f-a2fc-9c7547fbc257
2,methods2," Socio-economic status (Socio economic status (SES)) was also classified into three groups (tertiles; low, medium and high) according to the Socio economic status (SES) categorization already used, taking into account education level and the mean annual income over the preceding 3 years [14].  2.5.2. The Food Frequency Questionnaire  Dietary habits were assessed using a validated, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)), the EPIC–Greek questionnaire provided by the Unit of Nutrition of Athens University Medical School, and according to which participants recalled and reported average weekly or daily intakes of food items over the past year [15,16]. The questionnaire assessed the usual dietary intake of 156 foods and beverages typically consumed in Greece, with seven non-overlapping response categories. Pictures assisted the responders in defining the portion sizes in many foods that were included in the questionnaire.",94905df6-4b42-469c-b7e4-771a19c849de
3,methods3," Non-refined cereals and products (such as whole-grain bread, pasta, rice, etc.), vegetables, legumes, fruit, dairy products (such as cheese, yogurt, milk), nuts, potatoes, eggs, sweets, fish, poultry, red meat and meat products and use of olive oil in cooking, as well as coffee, tea and alcohol intake, were all calculated on a weekly basis over the past year. The frequency of consumption was quantified in terms of the number of times a month a food was consumed in small, medium or large portion sizes. Food intakes were extrapolated into macronutrient intakes by using food composition tables. Energy intake was calculated by summing the energy intake from macronutrients and alcohol, assuming 4 kcal/g for carbohydrates and proteins, 9 kcal/g for lipids and 7 kcal/g for alcohol.  2.5.3. Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, MedDietScore  A diet score (MedDietScore) was calculated based on the reported food intake and assessed adherence to the Mediterranean diet for each participant [16].",8f1f6291-d727-44ea-a1f0-a5340ee370e1
4,methods4," In particular, for the consumption of items presumed to be “close” to this pattern (i.e., those suggested daily or for more than four servings per week), we assigned a score of zero when someone reported no consumption, a score of 1 when they reported a consumption of 1 to 4 times per month, 2 for 5 to 8 times, 3 for 9 to 12, 4 for 13 to 18 and a score of 5 for more than 18 times per month. For the consumption of food items presumed to be “away” from this diet (such as meat and meat products) we assigned the scores on a reverse scale (i.e., 0 when a participant reported almost daily consumption and 5 for rare or no consumption). Especially for alcohol, we assigned a score of 5 for the consumption of fewer than 3 wine glasses per day, a score of zero for the consumption of more than 7 wineglasses per day and scores of 1 to 4 for the consumption of 3, 4–5, 6 and 7 wine glasses per day, respectively.",cb18cc67-c70d-4f0f-bd25-ccd9e96608ce
5,methods5," Higher values (range 0–55) of this special diet score indicate a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet [16].  2.5.4. Assessment of Physical Activity Using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ))  The short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) was used to assess physical activity status. International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used as an index of weekly energy expenditure using frequency (times per week), duration (in minutes per time) and intensity of sports or other habits related to physical activity (in expended calories per time) [17]. Sedentary participants were defined as those who did not report any physical activities, while the rest of the participants were classified as physically active.  2.5.5.",20ecd786-aabf-43f2-a812-f7d40f7bdff9
6,methods6," Smoking Habits Evaluation  Current smokers were classified as individuals who smoked at least one cigarette per day during the previous year, former smokers were defined as those who had quit smoking more than 1 year previously, and the rest were classified as never smokers.  2.6. Clinical and Biochemical Evaluation  Participants with fasting blood glucose >125 mg/dL during the examination or who reported taking anti-diabetic medication were defined as having diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association guidelines for the diagnosis of type-2 diabetes mellitus [18]. Blood glucose levels (mg/dL) were measured with a Beckman Glucose Analyser (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA, USA). Obesity was defined as a body mas index (body mas index (BMI)) greater than 29.9 Kg/m2 [19]. Arterial blood pressure was measured three times, with the participant in a sitting position and being at rest for at least 30 min.",1dd6e103-8068-455f-b66b-d869c1695fba
7,methods7," Participants who had an average blood pressure of ≥140/90 mmHg or were under anti-hypertensive medication were classified as being hypertensive. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as having total cholesterol levels >200 mg/dL or the use of lipids-lowering agents [20].  2.7. Psychological Evaluation  Irrational beliefs were assessed at baseline using the Irrational Beliefs Inventory (irrational beliefs inventory (IBI)), a brief self-report measure based on the work of Ellis [21]. The inventory consists of 11 statements, each reflecting one irrational belief, including, worrying, rigidity, need for approval, problem avoidance and emotional irresponsibility [22]. Each item is followed by a 9-point bipolar scale ranging from disagree to agree. The scales are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 88 (the higher the score, the greater the severity of irrational beliefs).",7fb41b18-fbe7-4a3c-b295-c5ed3cd1b0e6
8,methods8," The irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) was developed as an instrument to assess the association between the endorsement of irrational beliefs and various aspects of maladaptive emotion and behaviour that have been developed within Ellis’s theoretical and applied model, which views irrational beliefs as maladaptive [21].  The validated Greek translation of the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (Zung self rating depression scale (ZDRS)) was used to measure depressive symptomatology. The time window was the preceding 4-week period before the administration. The Zung self rating depression scale (ZDRS) total score range is 20–80, with higher values indicating more severe depression symptoms [23]. We applied a cut-off score of 45 to dichotomize the study cohort into participants with and without clinically relevant depressive symptomatology, based on the validated Zung self rating depression scale (ZDRS) cut-off score for the Greek population [24].",9ab18ad6-00e8-4d15-a4eb-3a11b8e85aa0
9,methods9," The validated Greek translation of the state anxiety sub-scale of the Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (state–trait anxiety inventory (STAI)) was used to assess anxiety levels [25]. The total score of the 20-item state–trait anxiety inventory (STAI) ranges from 20 to 80, with higher score values being indicative of more severe anxiety symptoms [23]. In the context of this study, the state–trait anxiety inventory (STAI) score was used as a continuous variable, since cut-off scores for the adult Greek population require further validation [25].  For this study, the high-irrational beliefs inventory (IBI)/low-state–trait anxiety inventory (STAI)–high-irrational beliefs inventory (IBI)/high-state–trait anxiety inventory (STAI) variable was created, classifying participants with a high irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) score (i.e.",e42b9910-b056-4e6a-86ce-8ea944bc2711

Similarly, the high-irrational beliefs inventory (IBI)/low-Zung self rating depression scale (ZDRS)–high-irrational beliefs inventory (IBI)/high-Zung self rating depression scale (ZDRS) variable was created classifying participants with a high irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) and a high Zung self rating depression scale (ZDRS) (>34, median) into one group and those with a high irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) and a low Zung self rating depression scale (ZDRS) into the other. It was observed that the 66% of participants who had a high irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) score (i.e., above the median value of 52) also had a high state–trait anxiety inventory (STAI) score (>40, median) (68% men vs.",d80c3a6b-f5db-4cc2-bb5e-f4b804cfebd5

Study Size, Power Analysis  Power analysis showed that the number of participants in the working dataset was adequate to evaluate two-sided differences between the sub-groups of the study and the investigated parameters greater than 20%, achieving statistical power >0.80 at <0.05 probability level (p-value).  2.9. Statistical Methods  Descriptive Statistics and Hypothesis Testing  Continuous variables are presented using mean values and ± standard deviation (SD) (or median (1st, 3rd quartile) if normality was not met), while categorical variables use frequencies. Associations between categorical variables were tested using the chi-squared test.",2175e558-a446-4b09-9cb1-be1172bbc029
12,methods12," For group comparisons between normally distributed continuous variables, the Student’s t-test was used, while for those that were not normally distributed the Mann–Whitney non-parametric test was applied. P-P plots were used to test for normality in continuous variables.  Multiple linear regression analysis evaluated the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the irrational beliefs, depression and anxiety of the participants, taking into consideration various socio-demographic, lifestyle and clinical characteristics. Results are presented as b-coefficients and 95% confidence intervals. The variance inflation factor (variance inflation factor (VIF)) was used to evaluate potential co-linearity between the independent variables (variables with variance inflation factor (VIF) > were excluded).",ff34229a-6f0c-4764-920d-c918145aecce
13,methods13," The Durbin–Watson criterion was applied to test for the serial dependency of the independent variables, and the scatter plot of residuals versus the fitted values was used to evaluate homoscedasticity.  2.10. Multivariate, Pattern Analysis  Factor analysis, using the principal component method, was applied to identify dietary patterns among the four psychological categories (high-irrational beliefs inventory (IBI)/low-state–trait anxiety inventory (STAI), high-irrational beliefs inventory (IBI)/high-state–trait anxiety inventory (STAI), high-irrational beliefs inventory (IBI)/low-Zung self rating depression scale (ZDRS) and high-irrational beliefs inventory (IBI)/high-Zung self rating depression scale (ZDRS)). From the entire food database, 27 food categories were selected to represent all major food groups.

14,methods14," The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin test (a measure of sampling adequacy for performing factor analysis) was relatively high (i.e., 0.61), indicating a relatively good inter-relationship between the food variables, suggesting that the data are suitable for factor analysis [26]. Food groups entered in the analysis were coded as servings per month. All Eigenvalues derived from the correlation matrix of the standardized variables were considered (an eigenvalue indicates the amount of the variance in consumption explained by each factor). A seventeen-factor solution was extracted, but the first five were considered and interpreted here, as they explained most of the variance in consumption. These factors (patterns) were interpreted (named) according to the scores of each food group that correlated with it most (i.e., scores > 0.4) (factor scores are interpreted similarly to correlation coefficients (i.e.",e5907b94-4c06-4e7f-baf9-cd1a4297b8c2

STATA software, version 16 (TStat S.r.l. 67039 Sulmona AQ, Italy) was used for all statistical analyses.  3. Results  3.1. Baseline Characteristics in Relation to Irrational Beliefs, Anxiety and Depression  The mean irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) score was 53 ± 11 for men and 53 ± 10 for women (p = 0.83), the mean state–trait anxiety inventory (STAI) score was 40 ± 11 for men and 42 ± 12 for women (p = 0.05) and the mean Zung self rating depression scale (ZDRS) score was 43 ± 10 for men and 47 ± 9 for women (p < 0.001).

Each of the remaining three factors explained from 9% (factor 4) to 12% (factor 2) of the variation in intake.  Thus, emotional disorders (in addition to irrational beliefs) predicted a diet close to a “Western” dietary pattern (i.e., high consumption of red meat, high-fat dairy products, butter, sweets, refined grains), whereas, the absence or lowered levels of anxiety and depression (in addition to irrational beliefs) predicted a less unhealthy dietary profile.  3.4. Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet in Relation to Irrational Beliefs, Anxiety and Depression Status  An age-adjusted, inverse correlation was observed between irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) score and MedDietScore (r = −0.11, p = 0.01). Similarly, MedDietScore was inversely correlated with state–trait anxiety inventory (STAI) (r men = −0.11, p < 0.001, r women = −0.20, p < 0.",2189a481-61db-4a2f-ae18-22d732b973aa

Regarding the association between adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern and irrational beliefs, in conjunction with anxiety and depression, it was observed that individuals with a high irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) and a low state–trait anxiety inventory (STAI) scored 28 ± 6 in the MedDietScore index, whereas individuals with a high irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) and a high state–trait anxiety inventory (STAI) scored much lower (23 ± 7 (p < 0.001)). However, individuals with a high irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) and a low Zung self rating depression scale (ZDRS) scored 23 ± 5 in the MedDietScore index, while those with a high irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) but a high Zung self rating depression scale (ZDRS) scored higher (i.e., 26 ± 7 (p < 0.001)).",8c75334b-6789-4cd3-ade3-ad3b93ec47f9

The analysis revealed that participants with a high irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) had a lower MedDietScore as compared to those with a low irrational beliefs inventory (IBI) (b coefficient = −0.95, 95% CI −1.24, −0.66, p = 0.001).",27226070-f585-46b4-895d-8ffb3a0e8141

Discussion  An analysis of macronutrient, food and pattern dietary intake, under the prism of irrational beliefs and emotional disorders, was applied in a group of adults with no known diagnoses. It was revealed that dietary habits correlate with irrational beliefs and, in association with the consequent psychological symptoms, they presumably affect the health status of individuals. In particular, it was clearly observed that people reporting irrational beliefs have unhealthier dietary habits, as compared to those without significant irrational beliefs and disorders.",51b18b91-13cb-4eea-9876-61d41fd1574f
28,methods28," It was also revealed that individuals with irrational beliefs who succumb to anxiety were more prone to adopt unhealthier eating habits, whereas individuals with irrational beliefs and depressive symptomatology were more likely to adopt healthier eating habits, as compared to those without depression but with irrational beliefs.  The present analysis is unique, as it attempted to test eating habits in relation to the co-existence of irrational beliefs with emotional disorders in a group of individuals from the general population; this approach has several risks and causality cannot be determined. Based on the applied dietary patterns analysis, it was revealed that the “Western” pattern diet was the most dominant for individuals with irrational beliefs and anxiety or depressive symptomatology.",79529502-e0e0-4297-99a3-f630c88c32c2
29,methods29," On the contrary, the high refined carbohydrates and fats dietary pattern (including nuts, dry fruits, sweets, soft and cola drinks, full-fat dairy products, seed oil and margarine) was the most dominant pattern for individuals with irrational beliefs but without severe emotional problems. Interestingly, when the analysis was based on an a-priori dietary pattern using the MedDietScore (instead of the a-posterior factor analysis), it was found that, although adherence to the Mediterranean diet was low among those with high irrational beliefs, the presence of depression symptoms seems to “prevent” individuals with irrational beliefs from adapting an unhealthy diet. The latter did not happen among those with anxiety symptoms in addition to irrational beliefs. Nevertheless, the findings demonstrate a general unhealthy diet in individuals who present with psychological distress symptoms.",cd0d0da7-f314-481e-8d25-6acc7e2a72be
30,methods30,"  Despite the limited literature associating dietary patterns with psychological disorders [27,28], some studies have indicated that following the Mediterranean and lacto–vegetarian diet, as well as eating vegetables, fruits and nuts and avoiding unhealthy snacks and meat, are linked to a lower risk of depression and other mental health conditions [27,29]. However, the “Western” dietary pattern raises the risk for mental health problems such as depression [30]. In addition, nutrients (such as ω-3PUFA) are essential for brain function, since they regulate chemical processes (e.g., metabolic pathways, neurotransmitter synthesis and cell–cell signalling) [31,32]. Our findings are consistent with the aforementioned literature; individuals with high irrational beliefs and anxiety or depression consume more red meat compared to individuals with irrational beliefs who do not experience psychopathological conditions, whereas the dietary patterns they mostly follow do not include seafood.",205a8015-d947-497a-95b6-fb8baae5ed8e
31,methods31,"  There are multitudinous biological pathways that explain the connection between diet and mental health, including inflammation, oxidative stress and hippocampus [33]. A fatty-food diet increases the risk for depression and anxiety [34,35]. In particular, a Western dietary pattern can result in elevated levels of circulating plasma Aβ that may trigger hippocampal dysfunction, while a diet high in sugar and fat (or just sugar) may damage hippocampal function as well [34]. On the contrary, the healthy pattern may improve cognitive function and reduce oxidative stress [36].  As described, most studies to date focus on how eating habits, nutrients and dietary patterns/behaviours influence mental health, rather than the reverse. However, individuals’ dietary preferences and behaviours are associated with personal beliefs and expectations, in addition to food availability, repetitive behaviours and learning mechanisms [37].",97f57680-7164-440a-85c8-55b34e15bec9
32,methods32," It is considered that irrational beliefs inevitably contribute to negative psychological outcomes (e.g., anxiety and depression) and, in turn, to irrational coping mechanisms (e.g., unhealthy nutrition, a sedentary lifestyle, etc.) and adverse health outcomes [11]. In particular, negative beliefs (e.g., low self-efficacy, the perception of one’s inability to control personal life and health and the perception of many life obstacles and side effects) have been found to consistently undermine the adoption of healthy eating habits [38]. Negative emotions (like anger, loneliness, anxiety and depression) have been identified as significant antecedents and triggers of eating problems [39]. Anxiety, in particular, increases appetite and leads to a desire for foods high in fat and sugar, or overeating as a coping mechanism to distract from distressing and stressful situations [40]. Furthermore, depression has been associated with a lack of motivation to engage in healthy behaviours [40].",a6675751-d1a5-4c49-a38f-9d5ac1a1bd21
33,methods33," Additionally, individuals with anxiety or depression are characterized by carbohydrate craving, an excessive degree of carbohydrate consumption (not in vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains and other fibres), due to an increase in brain serotonin synthesis, even though carbohydrates are the main source of energy in the brain [41]. This finding is supported by our study; people with high irrational beliefs and anxiety or depressive symptomatology consume more carbohydrates per day than those with low levels of anxiety or depression. It is important to note that our findings show that in individuals with irrational beliefs without psychopathology, a high-carb dietary behaviour is dominant as well.",c5c41e38-245c-486b-9e8a-caeb4ed5b53d
34,methods34,"  The blocking model, according to which problematic eating behaviours are used to block out short-term awareness of negative emotions that individuals find difficult to tolerate, may explain the tendency of people with strong irrational beliefs and psychopathology to engage in unhealthy eating behaviours [39]. However, the relief obtained through unhealthy eating behaviours is only temporary, resulting not merely in acute distress [39], but also in medical conditions such as obesity and other chronic diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, etc.).  Finally, as compared to individuals with irrational beliefs but without depressive symptomatology, the presence of depression symptoms—but not anxiety—seems to be associated with adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern.",713fc8f6-3856-4ebb-9f95-196389a562f7
35,methods35," Depressive disorder is usually more severe and recognizable than anxiety [42]; therefore, we hypothesize that individuals with depressive symptomatology may promptly seek information or consult a health professional. Since the benefits of a healthy diet against depression have been recognized for decades, these individuals likely have adopted healthy dietary habits as a result of a medical recommendation.  Limitations  Because of the cross-sectional design employed in this study, we cannot extract a clear direction in the research hypothesis (i.e., whether dietary habits are determinants of psychological disorders or the opposite). Therefore, in the present study we avoided such an analysis (by the exception of the regression models that evaluated adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern in relation to irrational beliefs and emotional disorders). In addition, residual confounding attributable to unmeasured factors always exists in epidemiological analyses.",9912b9e7-d8c5-475b-9df9-355b6a54e550
36,methods36," Moreover, the study sample is likely to be a limitation of the current work, although no differences in age, sex distribution and Socio economic status (SES) level were found between those who participated in the psychological evaluation and the rest of the ATTICA study participants. The baseline nutritional assessment was only performed once and it may be subject to measurement error or affected by seasonal variation and reproducibility of the collected information. However, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used was found to be reproducible and reliable, while the sampling took over a year, therefore including, on average, food choices during all seasons. Finally, we did not evaluate the presence of an eating disorder that could be a possible confounding variable, since patients with eating disorders justify refusing food by arguing nutritional concerns.  5.",deee0a6c-e5ad-49b4-bb24-bf1c116599c3
37,methods37," Conclusions  We consider that our study provides important information in the field of nutrition psychology, since it maps the eating behaviours of groups with specific psychological traits that have not been studied before, and shows that even when psychopathological characteristics are absent, irrational beliefs (i.e., precursors of anxiety disorders and depression) continue to be accompanied by unhealthy eating behaviours.
