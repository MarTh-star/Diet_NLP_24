Briefly, 166 subjects, referred to the Laboratory of Epidemiology and Biostatistics of the National Institute of Digestive Diseases, IRCCS “S. de Bellis”, Castellana Grotte, Italy, by their General Practitioners or identified during the NutriEp [5] or MICOL [33] enrollment or follow-up process, were assessed for eligibility. The trial was conducted from March 2015 to December 2016. Patients were consecutively enrolled, and the trial was registered at www.https://clinicaltrials.gov (registration number CT02347696). All subjects provided informed consent and the study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Ethical Committee (Prot. n. 10/CE/De Bellis, 3 February 2015).  2.2.

Sample Size Sample size was estimated considering the repeated measurements nature of the outcome. From a previous study [34], the mean ± Standard Deviation (SD) score of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) was estimated to be 4.5 (1) and 4.0 (0.5) for the treatment and control groups, respectively. We hypothesized a decrease by 20 units of the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score after three months of intervention. Probabilistic type I error was fixed at 0.05 (one sided) and probabilistic error type II was fixed at 0.10; statistical power was fixed at 0.9. The correlation between baseline/follow-up measurements of the outcome was set at 0.4. A sample size of n1 = n2 = n3 = n4 = n5 = n6 = 20 was estimated.  2.4.",43ee4918-d3b8-4ecc-8a69-338211f49a69
3,methods3," Data Collection During enrollment, patients were interviewed by trained nutritionists to collect information on socio-demographic aspects, medical history, and lifestyle. Information about physical activity was collected using the validated questionnaire International Physical Activity Questionnaire Long Form (IPAQ-LF) [35]. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Food Frequency Questionnaire (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) FFQ) was used to probe alcohol intake and eating behavior [36]. Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference) were taken in a standard manner. Weight and height measurements were taken using SECA instruments (Model 700; and Model 206; 220 cm; SECA, Hamburg, Germany). Blood samples, taken by venous puncture, were drawn in the morning after overnight fasting and were collected in tubes containing ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid (K-EDTA) anticoagulant.",86fdda2a-dbb5-460e-bf76-81d43386be5c

Randomization and Masking According to a computerized random numbers sequence, subjects were randomized to six arms as follows: (1) Control Diet (CD) based on CREA-AN (Research Center for Food and Nutrition, Council for Agricultural Research and Economics, Rome, Italy) guidelines [37]; (2) Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)); (3) Physical Activity aerobic program (PA1); (4) Physical Activity combined program (aerobic activity and resistance training) (PA2); (5) Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) plus PA1 and (6) Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) plus PA2. The trial flowchart is shown in Figure 1.  2.6.

Foods in Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) have all a low Glycemic Index (GI) and no more than 10% of total daily calories coming from saturated fats. The Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) was high in monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) from olive oil and contained also omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3PUFA), from both plant and marine sources. The prescribed diets were provided in brochure format, with graphic explanations. All participants were asked to record what they ate on a daily diary. The Mediterranean Adequacy Index (Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI)) was chosen as a relevant measure to evaluate the adherence to both the intervention diet and the control diet [38].",9bd536f6-fd31-4565-81b1-58634d814c72

Physical Activity Interventions To evaluate the initial physical condition, the right training program, and to compare the initial with the FU assessment of physical condition, three field tests were carried out: cardiorespiratory [40], strength [41], and flexibility fitness [42]. Cardio-respiratory fitness was assessed by means of the 2 km walking test, which is suitable for adults [40], whereas strength and flexibility fitness were evaluated by means of the push-up test (also called press-up test) and the Sit and Reach test, respectively.",d8c4b283-c6f3-4c4b-b105-c3e4779bc049
7,methods7," Subjects randomized to an intervention arm that included physical activity underwent the tests at baseline, after 45, and after 90 days, whereas subjects randomized to the diet arms underwent the field fitness tests at baseline and after 90 days. Physical activity interventions included two different types of exercise programs: Physical Activity 1 (PA1), based on the aerobic activity program, and Physical Activity 2 (PA2), based on the combination of aerobic activity and resistance training. The primary methods used for determining the intensity of prescribed exercise are maximum heart rate (Max HR), through heart-rate monitors [43], and metabolic equivalent (metabolic equivalent (MET)) [44,45]. To establish the age-predicted maximal heart rate, we used the formulas of Tanaka [46].

Statistical Analysis The intention-to-treat principle was applied in all analysis. A description of the data was performed by Means (±SD), Median (IQR), and Frequencies (%) as appropriate. Data were also described separately by Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity. Biochemical markers were included only for descriptive purposes. Adherence to PA programs was evaluated as the proportion of effective frequency/time/intensity spent on gym or field sessions divided by the expected weekly frequency/time/intensity per session for the aerobic exercise group, plus expected load for the combined exercise group.",f9082dfc-c2d7-42b4-8ea8-4ebfd628cab0
11,methods11," The adherence was estimated by age group, gender, and month, and it was expressed as percentage. The third to tenth weeks of intervention were considered. The first two weeks were excluded to give subjects the opportunity to adapt to the programs training, and the last two weeks were excluded because the compliance could be decreased. The adherence to the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) was measured with Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) [38]. Random week and weekend days were chosen from the second to 9th weeks of intervention. The first two weeks were excluded to allow participants to learn about the new diet and weeks successive to ninth were excluded because the compliance could decrease. To clearly describe the adherence and compliance to the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD), Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) was estimated by gender, age, and week.

To analyze differences among groups (Diet by Time), an Analysis of Variance for repeated measures was applied to the data. This statistical technique was chosen because it is relatively robust against violations of its assumptions, allows for multiple comparisons, and can be applied to a variety of experimental designs. Analysis of variance for repeated measurements was also performed by Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity. controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was normally distributed, so no transformation was needed. Post estimation procedures were performed to compare estimated means with the reference category (control diet at baseline). To display graphically prediction from the fitted model, margins post estimation commands were performed.

14,methods14,"  As expected, the age–sex distribution of the population under study reflected the age–sex distribution of the Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) condition in the population [4]. About 62% of the sample were men, and the mean age was 49.9 years (10.08), but few subjects were under 40 years old (12.5%). As expected, all subjects were overweight or obese with increased waist circumference. At baseline, almost every participant had low levels of HDL-C and a high HOMA-IR. Most subjects were married and had attended secondary school or higher (Table 2). All parameters considered were equally distributed among groups at baseline with the exception of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity. More subjects had severe than moderate Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), and the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) value was over 323 dB/m in all groups with a successive decreasing in intermediate and final observation times.",177a1e74-d13b-4774-b7e1-3d72fbf3202b
15,methods15,"  The behavior of anthropometric, body composition, and biochemical profiles by time and intervention arm are shown in Appendix A, Table A1. Overall, there were improvements in all markers, especially at 45 days. These improvements were particularly evident for intervention arms PA1 + Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) and PA2 + Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD).  Field Fitness Test results by gender and time are shown in Table 3.  Overall, there was a significant improvement of the fitness index in both men and women. The compliance to physical activity programs is shown in Table 4.  Overall, adherence was above 80% to both PA intervention program in both genders and in all weeks.  Compliance to Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD), as measured by Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI), by age class, gender, and week is shown in Table 5.  Compliance with the control diet showed a median Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) of 1.29 (0.77, 2.63).",c2a1f9f2-d788-42b2-9b01-566fe79bc3c9
16,methods16," Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) was lower amongst males (1.07) than females (2.14), whereas compliance with LGMID evidenced a median Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) of 11.2 (6.4, 22.8). Adherence was lower among women (10.0) than men (11.3).  Table 6 shows the changes in the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) value by intervention arms and time (at 45 days and at 90 days).  Apart from the CD, there were statistically significant principal effects of all the other intervention arms, Arms 3 and 5 showing the strongest effects (PA1: −166.35, 95%CI −242.01; −90.68 and Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) plus PA1: −94.10, 95% CI −170.87; −19.12).

Results from separate analysis by Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity are shown in Appendix A, Table A2 and Table A3. The relative decrease of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) values was more relevant among severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects. HOMA-IR decreased in all intervention arms with the exception of Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) in moderate Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects.",77913672-f9cc-409a-8569-2eb7639f7e4b
18,methods18," In both moderate and severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects, there was a modest effect of only-diet intervention arms on controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Only-PA intervention arms effect on controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) values evidenced a decrease among severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects but not among moderate ones. The most intense effect in decreasing controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) values was observed among severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects who underwent PA1+Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD). An improvement in all anthropometric, body composition, and biochemical parameters was observed (most evident at day 45). Noteworthy, the improvement in HDL-C was accompanied by an improvement in FFM only in moderate Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects.",efa00598-e675-4f8a-80ae-3e1cb72e7246

20,methods20," Hypothesis testing about the equality of measurements at baseline showed no statistically significant differences in controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) among intervention arms (p > 0.05).  4. Discussion In this RCT, the combination of the aerobic activity program and an Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) was associated with the strongest reduction of the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), as measured by FibroScan®, compared to the other intervention arms. Overall, this effect was greater until 45 days of intervention. However, the effect of Aerobic PA plus Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) was stronger during the complete intervention time in severe than moderate Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects. The effect on controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was accompanied by an overall improvement in all anthropometric, body composition and biochemical parameters.",9dd2a6ad-ccad-487b-9317-e1c1e5d1d483
21,methods21,"  Currently, a lifestyle change focused on diet and physical activity seems to be the best therapy in the treatment of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), combined with pharmacologic therapy when necessary [48]. Regular physical activity is now considered a therapy to prevent the onset and progression of several chronic diseases, including Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [49]. Aerobic, resistance and combination exercise programs may enhance systemic indicators of hepatic functions and intrahepatic fats in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) patients in both mild and advanced cases [50].  The adoption of either aerobic or strength PA programs showed to influence hepatic metabolism with a resulting decrease in hepatic fat accumulation, an increased insulin sensitivity, and fat oxidation. Moreover, these effects have been observed even without weight loss [51].",62abcf18-dc87-4d0b-921d-5ba5d49df769
22,methods22,"  Although the risk of developing Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) or more advanced grades of liver diseases seems to be exercise dose-related [52], no differences among different intensity aerobic exercise regimens were recently found: all of them reduced liver fat [53].  At the community level, a reduced infiltration of liver fat has been documented after a combined exercise program [54]. This effect was proportional to weight loss rate and event without it.  Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) was locally created by integrating the works of Trichopolou et al. [30] and Elia [31]. Moreover, we have adapted it to our population, and it is similar to the diet suggested by other authors for the metabolic syndrome [55].",600e2371-4c65-4502-8579-54f03ccd36b7
23,methods23," Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD), which contains no more than 10% of total daily calories deriving from saturated fats and a low glycemic index, was associated with a more intense reduction of the Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) score [28]. The Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) and also contains omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3PUFA).  In this RCT, in working Arm 2, where the subjects only followed a Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD), we observed a statistically significant improvement of the score of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), reducing the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) value, especially at 45 days. However, after 45 days, a slight increase in the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) value was observed.",9ec2e2fd-f1b2-45f0-ac74-2184af5c9f5e
24,methods24," Several studies have shown that lifestyle changes are difficult to implement and maintain for a long time, although individuals know the importance of having a healthier lifestyle [56,57]. In our study, adherence was almost homogenously distributed during the intervention time but, as it has been shown, participants could have given answers that are socially desirable [58].  When comparing the effectiveness of the two different physical activity programs, it is clear that both the aerobic and the combined exercise program significantly reduced the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) value. Our data are confirmed by previous studies that have demonstrated the effectiveness of aerobic activity on liver function [59,60]. Moreover, recently, resistance training has also been found to be effective in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) treatment, regardless of weight loss [61,62,63].",32aafd9a-ccd1-4b76-9601-fa582ee15433
25,methods25,"  Both aerobic exercise and combined exercise significantly reduced the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) value from 45 days onward until the end of the project. The literature exhaustively showed the efficacy of both combined and resistance training in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [64]. Furthermore, aerobic activity and resistance training have been recently shown, although with different mechanisms, to improve Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) score [23,65]. At least three mechanisms have been proposed for aerobic PA: activation of lipolysis in different tissues, upregulation of the uncoupling protein-1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ pathways, and alteration of adipokine levels [23]; on the other hand, resistance training stimulates the hypertrophy of type II muscle fibers, alters myokine levels, and activates glucose transporter 4, AMP-activated protein kinase, and caveolins [23].",c3904d6d-c723-4c3d-a677-c509962b8125
26,methods26," Moreover, resistance training appeared to improve Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) with less energy consumption. A recent study conducted in mice with diethyl nitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma has shown that in early stages, voluntary exercise decreases the proliferation rate of dysplastic hepatocytes [66].  Therefore, PA could be hypothesized as a preventive measure for liver cancer development, as Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a stage of a broad spectrum of conditions that lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. In this sense, after an energy restriction dietary intervention and/or regular PA, several facts have been observed such as histological improvements, resolution of liver fat, as well as necroinflammation and fibrosis. These changes have been observed even after 7% to 10% of weight loss [67,68].",61190159-e972-4df0-abd4-0124ee0bc7f4
27,methods27,"  Healthy dietary habits and healthy lifestyle, similar to any regular physical activity, can improve Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) more than weight loss alone [69].  Weight loss achieved by dietary treatment must be done taking into account quantitative and qualitative characteristics, as energy restriction per se is not sufficient to improve Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [22]. Moreover, a dietary composition modulating both macro and micronutrients is crucial [70]. Therefore, balanced nutrition such as Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD), moderate weight loss, and a physical activity program can be considered as the best therapeutic approach in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).",522748dc-fa4d-4ed7-9253-97a05d67538c
28,methods28,"  This seems to be confirmed in our study where the effect of intervention was more evident in the severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) group, highlighting that the combination of diet and physical activity can be an effective therapeutic tool in the prevention not only of the complications of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) but also of the associated cardiovascular risk. The observed effect in the severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) group could be due to the particular distribution of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity, as 75% of participants (data not shown) had severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) at baseline. Moreover, the use of FibroScan® as the Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) assessment method could have enhanced the frequency of severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) diagnosis.",6e0d7a2e-5ee9-4b87-8e31-c56a2fa86e88
29,methods29," It is known that FibroScan® has a greater sensibility [71] than Liver Ultrasound for fat infiltration >25–30% of hepatocytes [72].  The diminution of intrahepatic fat content is not the only marker of interest in this study. The metabolic pattern resulting from the interventions was explored, and the results are almost always in line with the literature. The negative association between adherence to Mediterranean diet and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) severity has been confirmed in this study as well as HOMA-IR decreasing, which has been more strong in severe Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects [19]. As noted above, we built a local version of the Mediterranean diet following the European Association for the study of the Liver, the European Association for the study of Diabetes, and the European Association for the study of Obesity guidelines [26]. After the intervention period, our results are similar to those of Ryan et al.",8f4c3eab-1c84-495c-905b-e2f78b75f0d0
30,methods30,", who found an improvement in fatty liver content and HOMA-IR [73]. Moreover, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis has documented beneficial changes of the Mediterranean diet on metabolic health, including anthropometric and biochemical markers [74].  As regards PA, a network meta-analysis has shown that aerobic exercise plus diet and aerobic exercise alone exert an improvement on Body Mass Index (BMI) and HOMA-IR but progressive resistance training has an effect only on HOMA-IR but not on Body Mass Index (BMI) [75]. While diet seems to be more effective at improving intrahepatic markers of liver damage, PA plus diet improves insulin resistance and Body Mass Index (BMI) [76]. However, in our study, there was a modest effect of only the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) intervention arm.",e1342a14-00bb-4506-92cb-db7a80cb4376
31,methods31," In the geographical area where the study was conducted, the Mediterranean diet is the most prevalent dietary pattern with a high adherence at population level, which may be the cause of the modest observed effect [76].  This study has several strengths and limitations. Strengths include the study design, the measured compliance to both dietary and PA interventions as well as their controlled application, and an adequate sample size. Moreover, a well-validated assessment of the outcome such as FibroScan® has been implemented. The applied intention-to-treat analytical strategy prevents the design from introducing bias relating to non-adherence to the protocol to the prognosis; therefore, this RCT provides an unbiased assessment of treatment efficacy [77]. It is worthy to note that in this area, the most prevalent dietary pattern is the local version of Mediterranean Diet; then, a dilution bias could be present.",770f9d3b-46d8-4056-a45c-bc47646e8267
32,methods32," Another limitation may be the duration of the intervention, which prevents a wide application in the clinical field, However, the objective of the study was to estimate the effect of the intervention in order to establish its efficacy.  5. Conclusions It is clear that PA single (aerobic or resistance exercise) or combined (aerobic plus resistance exercise) should be integrated into Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) management [78]. Moreover, aerobic exercise programs are simple to implement and the cost-efficiency is higher. These should be included in programs for the primary prevention of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.  In conclusion, a multidisciplinary team including dietitians, a psychologist, and physical activity supervisors is needed to ensure the best management of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) patients [78].
