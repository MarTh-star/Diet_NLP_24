0,methods0," 4.1. Search Strategy  The papers to be included were sought in the PubMed, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases in September 2020. The search terms used alone or in combination were: “Diet” OR “diet intervention” OR “dietary habits” OR “Mediterranean diet” OR “Omnivore diet” OR “Vegetarian and vegan diet” OR “Western diet AND human gut microbiota assessment” OR “Microbiome difference” OR “Microbiota changes” OR “Metabolomic changes” OR “Bacterial intestinal composition” OR “faecal microbiota” OR “faecal metabolic profile” OR “short-chain fatty acid production” OR “diet-enterotypes”.  We included all the clinical investigations involving the effect of a matching specific dietary regimen on gut microbiota assessment in healthy adults.",13f2d57f-ff92-49ee-9bdc-fa50ab7383e5
1,methods1," We assessed RCTs comparing dietary regimens as randomized controlled or randomized cross-over designed; we also considered cross-sectional studies evaluating the influence of a specific diet on gut microbiota composition.  4.2. Eligibility Criteria  To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to include microbiota assessment in healthy adults following specific dietary regimens: omnivore or including several nutrients. The study population had to be negative to any specific disease diagnosis, such as obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)), irritable bowel syndrome (irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)), cancer, and reported gastrointestinal or systemic diseases of any kind. The studies had to assess microbial composition to define significant differences in phyla, genera, or species levels after almost 3 months of omnivore diet.",c4ad9218-cb10-4f59-b02a-216d0798d0df
2,methods2," Another outcome considered to include in studies was the evaluation of the direct metabolic modification measured by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production. Only studies published in English over the previous 10 years were considered. Abstracts or conference communication were not included. The papers were selected by two independent reviewers (G.G. and M.D.S). We excluded studies conducted on animal populations or children. We did not consider studies on non-healthy adults, such as patients affected by obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or gastrointestinal disease such as inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)), irritable bowel syndrome (irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)), coeliac disease. Then, we excluded all the investigations regarding supplements or single nutrients (inulin supplementation, whole-grain assumption, gluten, Low FODMAPs, and omega3) to select only specific whole dietary regimens.",380e8721-b374-4e7e-8d10-1707e74abef0
3,methods3," Reviews or studies not reported as randomized controlled trials, or cross-over or cross-sectional studies, were not considered.  4.3. Study Selection and Data Extraction  The selection of articles for inclusion in the review was undertaken in two stages. The first stage involved screening the title and abstracts of the search results against the eligibility criteria. In the second stage, the full articles of papers selected in the title/abstract screening stage were screened to confirm that they met the eligibility criteria. At both stages, each article was screened independently by two authors (G.G. and M.D.S). Disagreement in eligibility status between the first two authors were resolved by a third author or mutual discussion.",713d70c8-2a7d-4504-999e-45f391a2c061
4,methods4,"  Papers were selected using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA)) flowchart and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) checklist [56] A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA)) flow diagram is summarized in Figure 1.  Two authors independently extracted data from each study. Data extracted included details of study design, participants (sample size, country/region, BMI), details of dietary regimen, and the measure of diet adherence and outcomes.  4.4. Quality Assessment of Studies  The quality assessment was based on the Cochrane Collaboration tool [16] for randomized trials and the Newcastle–Ottawa scale [57] for cross-sectional studies. Reporting details were conducted by two authors (G.G. and M.D.S.).",c9494572-ae05-496c-bc4f-72cfb258e862
5,methods5," The mean score for cross-sectional studies was 5/10 but there was no comparison between respondents and non-respondents as previously reported by Trefflich et al. [27], who performed a similar systematic review on vegetarian or vegan diet. Tables reporting the study assessment for respective scales are available as supplementary material (Tables S1–S3).  4.5. Microbiota Data Reports  Of the reviewed studies, evidence on microorganisms reported at phylum, family, genus, and species level was considered. Microbiota of subjects following omnivore diet was the only diet adopted or compared with other dietary regimens, mainly represented by vegetarians or vegans, assessed as control group.  5. Conclusions  The diet we consume is our interface with the world and its effects on our intestinal microbiota has an impact on our state of health and disease.",893d2399-50dd-462f-8a42-958cda1db767
6,methods6," New evidence increasingly correlates the complicated relationship and connection between the composition of our microbiome and many tissues of various functions [58]. We summarized some studies showing a significant impact on some bacterial genus of a rich and varied diet, often framed as Mediterranean. However, the variability in microbiota study techniques and its interactions with dietary and genetic factors not yet well defined make the evidence available today too uncertain. Further randomized human trials and research are needed to define the gut microbiota targets of our diet and how to modulate them with the most suitable combination of nutrients.  In conclusion, Hippocrates, father of medicine, already 2500 years ago ruled: “let food be your medicine and medicine be your food” emphasizing the importance of proper nutrition in the health of the individual.",df6ad59f-3810-4327-bf6b-4c014cbf086a
7,methods7," As it is now evident, it is a task of our generation of physicians to clarify what is the best diet for the human microbiota considering that the “diet of the future” must be not only functional but also environmentally sustainable.
