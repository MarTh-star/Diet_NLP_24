1,methods0," This systematic review was registered at the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews prior to the study commencement (Registration number: CRD42021270891). The review was reported by following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses) guidelines (see full PRISMA checklist in Table S1).  A comprehensive literature search was conducted on 2nd September, 2021 using electronic databases Cochrane CENTRAL Library (via Ovid), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)), Embase (via Ovid), MEDLINE (via Ovid) and Web of Science (Core Collection). Reference lists of final included articles were searched by 4th October, 2021 subsequent to database search. Three groups of key terms indicating the population, exposure and outcome of interest were adapted from an original search strategy to each of the databases.",acf49c1d-a237-414a-9c52-b377ac76e5b8
2,methods1," The original search strategy was formed as follows (with full search strategies in Table S2).  For extensive and thorough research on dietary patterns and symptomatic osteoarthritis, the search strategy included the terms ‘diet’, OR ‘diet therapy’, OR ‘diet pattern’, OR ‘diet intake’, OR ‘diet treatment’, OR ‘diet restrict’, OR ‘diet therapy’, OR ‘meal pattern’, OR ‘eating pattern’, OR ‘food pattern’ OR ‘eating pattern’ OR ‘food pattern’ OR ‘diet habit’ OR ‘food’ OR ‘food group’ AND ‘Symptomatic Diseases’ OR ‘symptomatic’ AND ‘osteoarthritis’ OR ‘Cartilage’ OR ‘chondral’ OR ‘meniscal’ OR ‘meniscus’ OR ‘bone marrow’ OR ‘subchondral’ OR ‘osteophyte’ OR ‘effusion’ OR ‘synovitis’ OR ‘ligament’ OR ‘attrition’ OR ‘fat pad’ AND ‘Joint’ AND ‘pain’, OR ‘aching’ OR ‘stiffness’, OR ‘tightness’ AND ‘middle aged’, OR ‘45+ years’, OR ‘older’ OR ‘ageing’, OR ‘aged’, OR ‘elder’, OR ‘elderly’.  The first and second screenings were conducted in duplicate by two reviewers.",11a08fc1-c2de-4a96-a2a3-55763d7b117f
3,methods2," The first screening included assessing the titles and abstracts of each study, and the second screening included a full‐text review. Both screenings were against the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in Table 1. Eligible articles involved populations aged ≥45 years with symptomatic osteoarthritis, assessing dietary patterns, diet quality, or food groups, with pain, stiffness in joints and physical function as outcomes. Eligible study designs were randomised controlled trials and cohort studies. Consensus was reached after comparing and discussing the results of screening by the two reviewers, and another two reviewers were available if consensus could not be reached by two reviewers.

7,methods6," Authors were contacted for any missing full text or data.  The quality assessment of included studies was conducted in duplicate by two reviewers. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist was used for risk of bias assessment at the cohort study level. 36 The Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tool consists of 11 questions with 4 answer options: ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘unclear’ and ‘not applicable’ (Table 4). The final judgement of including or excluding certain studies was determined by the overall appraisal. Studies which answered more than three ‘no’ or ‘unclear’ were considered poor quality and therefore were excluded. Any disagreement was discussed by two reviewers, and two additional reviewers involved if consensus was not reached.",e676d979-3e78-4b38-913d-20e860cc095e
8,methods7,"  The certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome as effect estimates by dietary pattern was assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and was categorised as ‘high’, ‘moderate’, ‘low’ and ‘very low’. The certainty of evidence could be downgraded either one or two levels based on five factors: risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias. ‘Serious’ indicates one level downgrading and ‘very serious’ indicates two levels downgrading. GRADE guideline 6 suggests population sample sizes over 400 are likely to meet optimal information size. 40 The downgrading of imprecision was determined by if the study had a small sample size <400, and/or wide 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Studies were downgraded by one level if CIs included both null effect and appreciable benefit (CI < 0.75) or harm (CI > 1.25). Studies were downgraded by two levels if CIs included both appreciable benefit and harm.",2bf96738-45e5-46fd-924c-65281ce632c6

48,results12," 2 The aetiology is categorised by bone joint cartilage deterioration, subchondral bone remodelling, synovial inflammation and articular cartilage loss. 3 There are radiographic and clinical definitions of osteoarthritis. Definitions of radiographic osteoarthritis differ among studies. For example, radiographic osteoarthritis can be defined as a Kellgren–Lawrence grade of 4 at baseline, 4 whilst another study 5 defines radiographic osteoarthritis as a Kellgren–Lawrence grade of ≥2 at follow up. The inflammatory response and the reduction of smooth movements caused by the physiological changes leads to clinical symptoms of pain, aching or stiffness. 6 , 7 However, not all individuals with joint symptoms are diagnosed with radiographic osteoarthritis. 8 The presence of such clinical symptoms plus the radiographic osteoarthritis is named as symptomatic osteoarthritis. 8 The activities of daily living and the quality of life are largely impacted in individuals with osteoarthritis.",38cdbee2-5528-4c6d-9bad-e0e223b10ac4
49,results13," 9 Therefore, osteoarthritis is considered one of the leading causes of disability among the older population. 10  The prevalence of osteoarthritis is strongly related to age and gender, increasing significantly from 45–54 years to 55–64 years (9.7%–20.7%) according to the Australian National Health Survey 2017–2018. 2 It affects approximately 6% of Australian males (n = 805 800, estimated) and 10% of Australian females (n = 749 200, estimated). 2 Osteoarthritis accounted for 19% of the total burden of disease due to musculoskeletal conditions in Australia in 2015. 11 Osteoarthritis' burden is projected to increase exponentially due to Australia's ageing and obese population, with prevalence expected to reach 3 million Australians by 2032 1 and 130 million internationally by 2050. 12  There are multiple risk factors involved in the generation and progression of osteoarthritis.

The certainty of the body of evidence ranged from low to very low and is limited. As highlighted, little is known about diet quality in individuals with osteoarthritis and its interrelationship with pain, physical dysfunction and quality of life, 42 indicating a need for additional research of a higher certainty of evidence.  Two studies explored associations between overall diet quality and symptomatic osteoarthritis, however, were inconsistent.

56,discussion2," 4 The inconclusive results could be attributed to a few factors, one being the different sample size (392 participants in Vitamin D Effect on Osteoarthritis (VIDEO) 39 against 2757 participants in American Osteoarthritis Initiative 4 ). The other factor could be the variation in how diet quality score is calculated. One study included alcohol when calculating the diet quality score, 39 whereas the other adjusted alcohol intake as a confounder. 4 A systematic review suggested alcohol may contribute to osteoarthritis via the mediation of BMI, despite its inconclusive effects. 43  The Western dietary pattern was positively associated with progression of symptomatic osteoarthritis. 4 The Western diet is abundant in saturated fat intake, which promotes white adipose tissue expansion and adipocyte dysfunction. 44 , 45 In addition, high energy and high refined carbohydrate intake are also the main components of the Western Diet.",2e058d93-a45c-46a3-ba3a-0e981f8922c0
57,discussion3," 44 These components contribute to the enhancement of inflammatory signalling and activation of inflammatory gene expression, hence increasing inflammation. 44 , 45 A prior study established a strong positive correlation between Western dietary patterns and the dietary inflammatory index. 46 Greater dietary inflammatory Index scores are linked with increased weight gain, obesity risk, 47 greater pain severity 42 and knee osteoarthritis prevalence. 34 However, associations between DII and symptomatic osteoarthritis may not entirely be accounted for via effect on BMI, and is potentially mediated via inflammatory markers. 34 , 48 Therefore, the Western diet and the pro‐inflammatory diet may have similar mechanisms in accelerating osteoarthritis progression. However, additional research is needed to determine the degree of impacts of the Western diet and diets with high inflammatory potential using consistent symptomatic osteoarthritis outcome assessments.",341e198f-630a-43aa-afa4-ce40e326a9a4
58,discussion4," These include using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain or pain improvement scores, or the same definition of symptomatic osteoarthritis, such as using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score.  One study explored Mediterranean diet associations on symptomatic osteoarthritis and pain worsening, 38 overall drawing inconclusive effects. Increased adherence to a Mediterranean diet may alleviate osteoarthritis symptoms by lowering serum levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines and other mediators, such as high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein, interleukins 6, 7 and 18, as well as decreasing oxidative stress biomarkers. 49 , 50 , 51 Thus, reducing these biomarkers slows cartilage degeneration. 7 , 52 , 53 Greater Mediterranean Diet scores were associated with reduced inflammation, 50 , 54 oxidative stress 47 and greater fibre and vitamins, which may exhibit a protective effect on osteoarthritis outcomes.",34aec7f3-3632-4b7b-b0a3-d3c58d18dede
59,discussion5," 5 The protective effects of the Mediterranean diet on the prevalence of osteoarthritis were shown in a previous systematic review with a fair risk of bias in middle‐aged adults and the elderly with or at risk of osteoarthritis. 33  The Prudent diet drew decreased effects on symptomatic osteoarthritis. The protective benefits of the Prudent dietary pattern on the risk of knee osteoarthritis were explored in adults aged over 45 years at a good quality in a previous systematic review. 32 This study 32 was a meta‐analysis exploring associations between general symptomatic osteoarthritis, knee osteoarthritis and dietary patterns.

60,discussion6," 32  Dietary components of the Prudent diet are similar to that of the Mediterranean diet, generally including high consumption of vegetables, fruits, fish, whole grains and legumes. 39 In addition, high adherence to a prudent diet was negatively associated with systemic inflammatory biomarkers, such as leptin, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule 1, E‐selectin and C‐reactive protein. 55 , 56 As such, the causes for the preventive effects of decreasing symptomatic osteoarthritis progression of the Prudent diet may be similar to those of the Mediterranean diet via similar mechanisms explained above.  Two studies examined the associations between dietary fibre intake and symptomatic osteoarthritis. 5 , 37 The protective effects of total fibre consumption were constant across both studies with a significant dose‐dependent downward trend, however, the effects of fibre from each food group were inconclusive.",9c8bde9e-1b42-4a96-b996-3d4e52cf2ad1
61,discussion7," The protective effects of dietary fibre are regulated by its fermentation products, short chain fatty acids. 57 Short chain fatty acids inhibit inflammatory responses by activating G Protein‐coupled Receptor, 58 which has anti‐inflammatory properties, and by suppressing the expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines. 57 , 59 One study discovered that fruit and vegetable fibre were inversely associated with moderate knee pain and cereal fibre and fruit and vegetable fibre were inversely associated with severe knee pain, 37 whereas the other failed to demonstrate significant effects of fibre from each food group. 5 One study included an additional adjustment for BMI, 5 whilst the other did not. 37 Another argument could be that categorising pain levels allows for more precise outcomes, as the magnitude of positive effects may be diluted in the absence of pain classification.",833d05dc-df27-428a-9dc7-4c71b41d0098
62,discussion8," One study 37 explored fibre intake effects on mild, moderate and severe pain, whilst one investigated effects on overall pain. 5 Moreover, increased total fibre, and nut and legume fibre, were found to be inversely associated with incidence symptomatic osteoarthritis in the Framingham study, such effects attenuated in American Osteoarthritis Initiative. 5 The discrepancy could be explained by the fact that American Osteoarthritis Initiative and the Framingham trial had different sample sizes, participant characteristics, especially that the American Osteoarthritis Initiative cohort had a higher mean BMI than Framingham Study participants, raising collider bias potential via conditioning on BMI, and dietary fibre quartile cut‐offs and the Framingham study measured dietary consumption 4 years later at follow‐up. Slight intake increments present in the study sample over the follow‐up were unaccounted for in the American Osteoarthritis Initiative cohort.",94d77ed4-a82e-400c-8ddf-a468a735a26b
63,discussion9," 37 Furthermore, additional research focusing on dietary fibre intake and associations with symptomatic osteoarthritis in adults 45+ year would be beneficial to raise the certainty of the body of evidence.  In contrast to previous review studies, the present systematic review focused exclusively on symptomatic osteoarthritis as the outcome. The findings indicate that diet quality, dietary patterns and food groups influence not just radiographic osteoarthritis progression, but also symptomatic osteoarthritis progression. Many previous studies explored nutrient and symptomatic osteoarthritis associations, with single dietary components failing to be corroborated in randomised trials. 20 Review strengths included the large sample size of the six articles, PROSPERO registration to allow method transparency, a comprehensive search strategy that was reviewed by supervisors and University of Sydney librarians, and included five databases.

64,discussion10," Quality assessment tools enabled risk of bias assessment for cohort studies using Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Certainty of the evidence for dietary patterns and outcomes were assessed using GRADE.   However, there were limitations. Bi‐direction via meta‐analysis could not be explored due to the few included studies and heterogeneity of exposure and outcome measurements. A range of dietary patterns and food groups were included using different measuring methods. Despite the fact that all dietary intake measurement methods are validated, their accuracy may be varied. Knee pain assessment heterogeneity between studies may also hinder the review's accuracy of findings. Frequent knee pain was defined as pain, aching or stiffness in the knee on most days during the past 30 days, 5 , 38 whilst one study queried whether participants had experienced this over the past 12 months.",0cf40128-7128-418c-90e6-4a715661ea5c
65,discussion11," 34 Large effects were identified as more than 50% of protective effects observed for dietary patterns on symptomatic osteoarthritis outcomes. Upgrading the certainty of evidence in this review was prohibited due to concerns about risk of bias and imprecision. 60 , 61 The risk of bias of the included studies cannot be eliminated due to potential residual confounders in the observational studies, such as BMI, 34 , 37 alcohol 5 , 34 , 37 , 39 and depression, 5 , 34 , 39 cohort study design, significant differences among baseline participant characteristics baseline and unclear strategies addressing loss to follow up. Additionally, studies merely assessed baseline dietary intake, with the exception of the Framingham study. 5 Under‐ or overestimation of dietary intake can occur due to self‐reported dietary data prone to bias. 62 Cohort studies are observational studies that do not prove causality, raising residual confounding concerns.",17a08bed-e855-4a82-afb8-7b3f28aec877
66,discussion12," 5 They merely provide empirical evidence, and results should be confirmed by studies at higher certainty of evidence.  There are limitations regarding search strategy, language and practicality. This systematic review included only English‐language articles and lacked exhaustive search strategies for trial registries and grey literature from websites and organisations. Additionally, despite attempts to contact authors for full‐text retrieval, certain articles were excluded due to author non‐response. Therefore, it is plausible that certain pertinent articles may be omitted. Furthermore, studies involving intervention via energy restriction were not included. This is because the effect of diet is difficult to distinguish from the effect of weight loss.",fd09a30d-78b4-4a79-809e-428a6d08a3e0
67,discussion13," Finally, because all six studies involved participants with osteoarthritis and were conducted in developed countries, the findings of this systematic review may not be generalisable to non‐American Osteoarthritis Initiative populations as dietary patterns vary by ethnic and environmental backgrounds.  As shown by the results of the six reviewed studies, associations were identified between dietary intake, diet quality, food groups and symptomatic osteoarthritis in adults aged 45 years and older. Participants following a higher prudent dietary pattern had the greatest symptomatic osteoarthritis reduction. The currently limited body of evidence due to low certainty attributable to heterogeneity and study limitations suggest that there is a knowledge gap regarding the association between diet and symptomatic osteoarthritis.",cb4d1bd9-7b66-40a2-9d04-dec1fde1e92f
68,discussion14," Further research is warranted to confirm the estimated effects at a high certainty of evidence, and to investigate the effects of other dietary patterns and food groups on symptomatic osteoarthritis, such as DASH. Identifying the most effective dietary patterns may aid in the development of future symptomatic osteoarthritis management guidelines.
