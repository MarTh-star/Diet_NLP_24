0,methods0,"2.1. Study Population This study was conducted using data from the publicly available, cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) survey from 2011–2014. These data cycles were selected due to the availability of comprehensive cognitive evaluation that began with the 2011–2012 cycle and is most recently reported in the 2013–2014 cycle. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data and the variable codebook described are freely available at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) used a multistage probability sampling design to produce a weighted, representative sample of the US population [14]. The National Center for Health Statistics Research Ethics Review Board approved all National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) protocols, and all participants gave informed consent.",dcc0e634-2bd0-4c4a-9a1c-ff94ea5a800b
1,methods1, Our sample included adults ≥60 years old that completed two 24-h food intake recalls and completed at least one cognitive assessment (n = 3068). Figure 1 illustrates the flow of participants selected for inclusion in this analysis. Reported energy intake from all participants was plausible for a given day. Modified z-scores of energy intake were also calculated and indicated that no extreme outliers existed (no absolute values ≥3.5) [15].  2.2. Dietary Intake Assessment Trained 24-h food recall surveyors conducted two multiple pass 24-h food recalls with participants. The first was a visually-assisted recall conducted in-person at the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Mobile Evaluation Center (Mobile Evaluation Center (MEC)). The second 24-h recall interview was conducted over the telephone three to ten days after collection of the first food recall.,c2810be9-044b-4f82-9fe5-57356da3c5a2
2,methods2, Participants without a telephone were given a toll-free number to call in order to complete the second 24-h recall. Nutrient and individual food data were quantified using the USDA’s Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (15). Individual food data were further combined into 37 food and beverage groupings known as the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED)) (16). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED) datasets are publicly available at the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service website (available at: https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/food-surveys-research-group/docs/fped-databases/). All dietary intake data from both 24-h recalls were aggregated as average intake from the two days for each participant.  2.3.,68f4a29a-24bf-4945-9660-36c60e37a4e6
3,methods3," Mediterranean Diet Adherence Assessment MedD adherence scores were calculated using the 18-point, literature-based Mediterranean Diet Index constructed by Sofi et al. [16] with slight modification. Sofi adherence scores are derived by an assigned value of “0”, “1”, or “2” across nine food categories, with higher scores indicating better adherence to a MedD pattern. Higher MedD component scores reflect more intake of each food component except red meat, which receives a higher score due to less intake, and alcohol, which receives a score of 0 for >24 g, 1 for <12 g, and 2 for >12 g to 24 g of intake per day. These scores are calculated using gram intake references for each category, with the exception of a categorical reference for olive oil of 0 = never, 1 = sometimes, and 2 = frequently. MedD scores were calculated using Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED) groupings and their reported intakes in grams.",fc639b0a-9cb9-470b-8d46-5bcf508c2b64
4,methods4," Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED) groups relevant for calculation of MedD scores in this study are reported in Table 1. Of interest, Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED) fruit and vegetable variables were reported as cup equivalent (CE) intakes. Because these groups were reports of aggregated intake based on individual food intakes without knowing the particular fruits and vegetables consumed to arrive at these CE values, we were unable to convert CEs into grams. Thus, we modified the MedD fruit scores to reflect 0 = <1 CE, 1 = ≥1 CE, and 2 = ≥2 CEs and MedD vegetable scores to reflect 0 = <0.5 CEs, 1 = ≥0.5 CEs, and 2 = ≥1 CE per day. We also extracted olive oil intake in grams from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) individual food component intake data and modified the score to reflect 0 = <14 g, 1 = ≥14 g, and 2 = ≥28 g per day (0, 1, or 2 tablespoons, respectively).",823c2a73-e866-4723-8a3f-79e149d5ca6b
5,methods5," All other MedD component scores were calculated in accordance with Sofi et al.  2.4. Cognition Assessment A cognitive assessment battery was administered to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) survey participants aged ≥60 years that did not require a proxy informant and could read and understand English, Spanish, Korean, Vietnamese, traditional or simplified Mandarin, or Cantonese. The cognitive battery consisted of the word learning and recall modules from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD)), the Animal Fluency Test (Animal Fluency Test (AFT)), and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)), which are described in the following sections. Non-response to cognitive testing for any reason was treated as missing data and not included in the analyses.  2.4.1.",675d9999-1b88-47fe-8a0c-092407768e26
6,methods6," Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD)) The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) assesses immediate learning and delayed recall of new verbal information [17]. Three consecutive word learning trials of 10 words were administered. Participants were presented with 10 of the same unrelated words printed in a different order at each trial. After reading the 10 words out loud, participants immediately recalled as many of the presented words as possible. The total number of correct immediately recalled words was calculated as the individual trial word-learning score. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) immediate learning score for this analysis was an average number of words recalled across the three trials.",a0a2c77b-bc8d-446c-9275-6dfb6139a0ea
7,methods7," Delayed recall was scored by asking participants to recall as many words as possible from the originally presented list of 10 after administration of Animal Fluency Test (AFT) and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) (approximately 8-10 min after original presentation of the word list).  2.4.2. Animal Fluency Test (Animal Fluency Test (AFT)) The Animal Fluency Test (AFT) assesses the categorical verbal fluency domain of executive function [18]. The Animal Fluency Test (AFT) asks that participants name as many animals as possible in one minute. One point was assigned for each animal named within the timed portion of the test. In order to acclimatize to the categorical naming demand of the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants were administered a practice test that required they name three clothing items. If the participant was unable to name three clothing items, the Animal Fluency Test (AFT) was not administered.  2.4.3.",a1e5ec8a-ce91-4ac2-8e99-36d7c609af46
8,methods8," Digit Symbol Substitution Test The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) is a subtest within the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS III) that assesses processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory [19,20]. In a legend located at the top of the paper test, nine numbers are paired with unique symbols. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants had 2 min to draw the unique symbol that corresponded with the number into 133 paired, blank boxes. Scoring for the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) is the total number of correct symbol and number pairs in the allotted time. A standardized practice test was administered prior to initiation of the scored portion of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Participants who were unable to match symbols with the numbers without assistance did not complete the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST).  2.4.4.",4e683919-b2b6-4112-839c-60b274805687
9,methods9," Calculation of Education-Dependent Cognitive Z-Scores Because education level is a significant contributor to cognitive performance, we calculated education-dependent z-scores for each participant. Individuals were stratified by five education levels, <9th grade, 9–11th grade, high school graduate or GED, some college or associate’s degree, and college graduate or above. Education-dependent scores for each cognitive test were centered and scaled to have mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 within each education strata. A global cognitive measure was calculated as the average of standardized scores from each individual cognitive test. Individual and global standardized cognitive scores <−1 were characterized as “low cognitive performance” for their respective cognitive measure.  2.5. Subjective Memory Changes National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants were asked medical condition interview questions in the home by trained interviewers.",1d0b01dd-5960-4d71-87cb-c7005bd87285
10,methods10," Males and females aged ≥60 years were asked, “During the past 12 months, have you experienced confusion or memory loss that is happening more often or is getting worse?”. Answers to this question were used to stratify participants into two groups, those reporting subjective memory changes and those with no subjective memory changes.  2.6. Covariates Study covariates included age as a continuous variable, sex, BMI as a continuous variable, race/ethnicity, ratio of family income to poverty level as a continuous variable (reported family income divided by the Health and Human Services poverty guidelines specific to the survey year), marital status, smoking status as a categorical variable, diabetes status as a categorical variable, history of cardiovascular disease as a categorical variable, history of hypertension as a categorical variable, and history of stroke as a categorical variable.",3cb8c4bb-7362-41b1-89e9-d943ba9589bf

Hours of moderate-vigorous exercise per week was considered as a covariate, but 60% of reported data was missing and not used in the analyses.  2.7. Outcomes The primary aim of this study was to report the mean population adherence to a MedD in adults ≥60 years old and explore categorical differences in adherence to this particular diet pattern. The secondary aim was to assess the cross-sectional relationship between MedD adherence scores and five indicators of cognition (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) Immediate Learning, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Animal Fluency Test (AFT), Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) Delayed Recall, and global cognition).  2.8.",cb8bea81-c151-4e2f-bf50-5816a25bee91
12,methods12," Statistical Analyses To account for complex survey design and produce representative estimates of the US population, analyses were conducted using the [survey] package for R (v. 3.6.1; R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). Four-year survey weights were calculated and used in all analyses to adjust for unequal selection probability and non-response bias in accordance with National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) analytical guidelines [21]. Population means, proportions, and standard deviations were estimated and reported. Unless otherwise indicated, statistical analyses were adjusted for all covariates. Observations with missing covariate data were excluded from cognitive statistical analyses. MedD scores and cognitive scores were treated as continuous measures and modeled using survey-weighted ordinary least squares (ordinary least squares (OLS)) regression to assess the linear relationship between MedD scores and education-dependent, standardized cognitive scores.",9466ee44-8067-4e87-aa1b-50a87967637c
13,methods13," We conducted trend analyses using kernel smoothing to explore these relationships. We observed a sharp upward trend in cognitive test performance in the top third of MedD scores. Thus, tertiles with equal group samples were calculated to characterize “lowest”, “middle”, and “highest” MedD adherence categories to further examine these relationships. We divided education-dependent, standardized cognitive scores into binary variables (“low” < −1 and “not low” ≥ −1) and conducted survey-weighted binary logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) for low cognition across the three MedD adherence tertiles. Assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) models were evaluated through residual analyses (e.g., quantile-quantile plots and residual histograms).",67ea3fd6-cec9-4f61-8af2-c5f8d745adbc
14,methods14," All other categorical assessments by MedD adherence tertile were performed by survey-weighted Pearson’s chi-squared tests and mean differences of continuous variables were performed using survey-weighted ANOVA using Tukey’s HSD adjustment for multiple comparisons, a special case of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis only with participants that reported no subjective complaints of memory change over the past 12 months. We calculated new MedD tertile scores in this subset and used binary logistic models to assess odds ratios for low cognitive performance across the new MedD adherence tertiles.

Across MedD tertile adherence categories, the proportion of non-Hispanic white participants was highest in the lowest tertile and decreased significantly from the lowest to highest tertile while the proportion of non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, other Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Asian participants increased with higher MedD adherence.  Mean estimates of MedD component scores across the population are presented in Table 3.

Categorical differences in mean MedD scores are presented in Figure 2. Females had higher MedD scores than males. Broken into 5-year age categories, older adults aged 70–74.9 years had higher MedD scores (5.7 ± 2.7) than all other age categories and 60-64.9 years had higher scores (5.3 ± 3.1) than those aged 80+ years, the age group with the lowest scores (5.0 ± 1.9). Among race/ethnicity categories, non-Hispanic white participants had lower MedD scores (5.2 ± 2.1) relative to all other categories other than other race, and non-Hispanic Asian participants had significantly higher scores than all race/ethnicity groups (6.7 ± 2.6).",772ab24f-a6b2-44f8-94f0-11d0f19c5ce8
17,methods17," There was little significant difference in MedD scores by education level; however, older adults that completed college or above had significantly higher MedD scores than all other individuals (5.8 ± 2.7). Accounting for income, those reporting an income to poverty ratio >2 had slightly higher MedD scores (5.4 ± 4.2) than those reporting a ratio of 1–2 (5.2 ± 2.0) or <1 (5.0 ± 3.4). Cohabitating, non-married individuals had much lower MedD scores (4.2 ± 3.4) with a wide degree of variation compared to all other categories of marital status.

20,methods20," Discussion The current study is the first to use a fixed, generalizable MedD index to estimate the level at which older adults in the US adopt a Mediterranean style eating pattern and provides additional observational evidence that higher consumption of this pattern is related to better cognition. Our analysis revealed that older adults in the US sampled from 2011 to 2014 do not eat a diet that resembles a Mediterranean diet pattern. Although scores across the entire cohort were generally low, individuals with even slightly higher MedD scores had better cognitive performance.  This evidence demonstrates that population estimated MedD adherence is low overall and within various demographic categories of older adults living in the US. As a whole, older adults had a MedD score of 5.3 out of a possible 18 (29% of the maximum score). The most remarkably low MedD component scores were cereals (whole grains) and olive oil with mean scores only slightly greater than zero.",900a4f99-3dde-4076-957b-382b2247144f
21,methods21," In order to receive a score of “1” for cereals, an individual must consume approximately 4½ oz. of whole grains. These data indicate that older adults do not meet this standard and likely consume the largest proportion of their grains as refined grains. Also, of the 3068 participants surveyed, only 91 reported consuming olive oil in any quantity during the 24-h food recalls. Very little report of olive oil consumption is of particular interest as its intake has purported benefits for various health parameters, including cognition [22,23,24,25]. The red meat component had a particularly high score of 75% of the maximum, indicating that estimated red meat intake among older adults is relatively low.  There were MedD adherence differences across multiple demographic factors. Females had higher MedD scores than males. Older adults aged 70–74.9 years had higher adherence scores than all other age groups and those aged 80+ years had lower scores than all other groups.",4a88d105-6f7e-4709-9c3b-2c103f1b0bbb
22,methods22," Non-Hispanic White elders had lower adherence scores than all other race/ethnicity groups and Non-Hispanic Asians had much higher scores than all other races, although their mean score was only 38% of the maximum MedD score. Education also made a modest impact on MedD scores. MedD scores were relatively similar among all education levels but increased sharply in those with a college degree or above. Though difficult to interpret, older adults that reported to be cohabitating with their significant other had a mean MedD score of 4.2, significantly lower than all other marital status categories. In accordance with diet quality findings from other studies, MedD adherence was lower in individuals with a household income at or below the poverty level [26,27], indicating that consuming a healthy diet is likely influenced by an economic component [28].",8124a7b2-5be5-4f49-8d8b-e060c6dbc90d
23,methods23," An important consideration in interpreting these demographic-related findings is that although these differences are statistically significant, their real-life significance is presumably low–across all groups, MedD adherence is very low and evidence of higher MedD scores by a few tenths of a point or the like is not a real indicator of meaningfully better diet quality.  This is not the first study to investigate National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data using a MedD quality index, yet it is the first to characterize MedD pattern adherence using a generalizable, fixed index. Previous reports have used indices that rely upon sample median values to produce a sample-dependent MedD score [29,30] or make assumptions of portion size [31,32] using Panagiotakos et al. [33] to differentiate MedD consumption among the study sample and investigate whether intake differences are related to desired outcomes.",0ac944da-8fb3-49ea-85ef-eeb7c1243f82
24,methods24," While useful, there are multiple issues with these index scoring methods. First, median-based assignment of dietary adherence scores is purely relative to the specific study sample used to derive the scores and is not generalizable to other study samples, which are highly variable. The median-based approach assigns a score of “0” when individual intake is lower than the selected sample’s sex-dependent median intake or “1” when individual intake is higher than the sex-dependent median across nine MedD categories. Exemplified by the present study, if the sample clusters on the lower end of intake, then individuals with intake above the median reflect high adherence scores that are not truly indicative of actual high MedD adherence. The use of a fixed MedD index within this cohort allowed us to calculate adherence scores that are generalizable across cohorts and characterize the truly low MedD adherence of US older adults.  MedD scores were 4.",73e55551-987c-4b2d-bc87-0f9d97843795
25,methods25,"6 points higher from the lowest tertile of adherence to the highest tertile of adherence, which also correlated with better protection of cognitive performance in three of the five cognition measures from this study. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that higher adherence to the MedD is related to better cognition in older adults, specifically tests of working memory, processing speed, and delayed recall. The lowest tertile of MedD adherence achieved a score of 18% of the maximum score of 18 and the highest adherence tertile achieved a score of 43% of the maximum. These observations suggest that benefits of higher diet quality may not be limited to achieving nearly perfect adherence to a MedD, but that small adherence improvements may provide cognitive benefit.",7540f23e-bc7b-46fd-b492-4061bbc0f24d
26,methods26," Due to low MedD scores across the entire study population, we were unable to assess whether this trend of better cognitive performance with higher MedD adherence scores further extends to those with high or very high MedD adherence. The extent to which changes in dietary adherence to the MedD potentiate cognitive benefit will need to be studied extensively through randomized clinical trial (RCT)s.  The mechanisms by which the MedD may influence cognition in older adults remain unclear. In the past, researchers have been interested in the impact of single nutrients on health outcomes including cognitive performance and AD risk [34,35]. The influence of individual MedD-related food components on cognition and AD risk has also been studied. The relatively recent interest in a holistic view of diet, such as the MedD, is due to the likely synergistic effect of food/nutrients on health outcomes [36].",d364e672-1024-479e-b39d-bc1b2b966f5a
27,methods27," The cumulative effect of the MedD on cardiometabolic health [37] and glucose metabolism status [38], both risk factors for cognitive decline [39], and the nutrient-density of the diet in general may affect cognition outcomes through multiple mechanisms.  These analyses were conducted using data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative health and nutrition survey in the United States, which has inherent strengths and limitations. The primary strength of this study is a survey sampling design that allows for population-based estimations with a high level of confidence. There are also several limitations to this study. First, the cross-sectional nature of this analysis does not allow for the assessment of causality and we cannot rule out the possibility that lower cognition may influence food decision making, manifesting as lower MedD adherence scores.",dea80ebc-4e00-47d7-8bd5-fea7308c1484
28,methods28," Dietary intake methodology that assesses two full days of consumption over a several-day period may not accurately reflect how individual participants have eaten over the course of their lives or if the reported intake reflects actual usual dietary intake. Concern about these methods have previously been raised [40]; however, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) methods are an optimal approach for assessing population-level dietary intake [41]. We did not perform mixed-effects analyses on the two-24 h recalls in this study, which described MedD adherence over two given days rather than provide an estimate for usual intake. Finally, these data were sampled from 2011 to 2014, which may have been slightly ahead of increased social popularity of the MedD. It is possible that older adults sampled more recently have made dietary adaptations toward a MedD pattern.",61271823-4825-4631-bb45-14f620cc237f
29,methods29,"  In conclusion, older adults living in the US do not follow a MedD eating pattern and these data suggest that consuming a diet that slightly more resembles a MedD pattern may be protective of cognitive performance. It is reasonable to use the MedD as a dietary intervention as it is a major departure from the general diet pattern of older adults in the US. It is projected that AD prevalence will rise in the coming decades, thus it is imperative to conduct randomized clinical trial (RCT)s to test whether the MedD is truly protective of cognition and can effectively reduce the risk, hence the prevalence, of AD.
