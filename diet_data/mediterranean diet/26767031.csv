0,methods0,"Literature Search We conducted the present systematic review and meta-analysis according to standard criteria4344. We searched the PubMed and the Embase from inception to August 13th, 2016 for records relevant to the Mediterranean diet and the risk of developing cognitive disorders with no language restriction. Our research terms included “Mediterranean”, “dementia”, “AD”, “Alzheimer*”, “aphronesia” and “cognitive*”, etc. (Supplementary Table 1). We manually searched the reference lists of the relevant original articles and systematic reviews in order to ascertain more eligible articles. When multiple publications from the same study were identified, the article with the longest duration of follow-up was included in the present analysis.  Selection Criteria and Data Extraction Two authors (Wu and Sun) performed the initial screen following the selection criteria independently.",df56dd56-7444-488a-a5b3-75475b76aa19
1,methods1," Duplicate records were excluded, and the title and abstract of each article was assessed independently for further assessment or exclusion. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion between the two authors.  The inclusion criteria were listed as follows: (1) studies reported the incident risk of developing cognitive disorders (mild cognitive impairment, cognitive decline, AD, and dementia) in participants with adherence to Mediterranean diet by using adjusted relative risks (RRs) or hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs); (2) adherence to the Mediterranean diet was defined according to the Mediterranean score. All articles provided the Mediterranean score were included in the pooled analysis, regardless of different category and different total points of the Mediterranean diet score. For instance, continuous, tertile and quintile category of Mediterranean score were all included in the present study.",37954dee-e7bb-4926-b62f-d6364ea9ec59
2,methods2," (3) prospective cohort design. Studies were excluded if: (1) data reported single nutrients or individual element of the Mediterranean diet; (2) the study subjects were not adults; (3) the article was a conference abstract.  The following information were extracted by Wu and Sun independently from each article: first author, year of publication, study location, sample size, gender and age of the study participants, number of incident cases, method of exposure and outcome measurements, type of outcome, follow-up duration, category of Mediterranean diet score, ORs or RRs or HRs with corresponding 95% CIs of the incident cognitive disorders for all categories of Mediterranean diet score with the largest number of adjusted covariates.  Quality Assessment We used the Newcastle-Ottawa quality scale (Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS))45 to assess the quality of the included articles. Higher score indicated higher study quality, and the scale was ranged between 0 to 9 points.",5bdf0df6-1fd4-4e3c-a210-89006c13e86c
3,methods3," The following three domains were assessed: the basis of the cohort selection (representativeness of the exposed cohort, selection of the non-exposed cohort, ascertainment of exposure to implants, and demonstration that outcome of interest was not present at start of study); the comparability of the cohort design and analysis (study controls for important and any additional covariates); and the adequacy of the exposure and outcome measurements (assessment of outcome, follow-up long enough for outcomes to occur, and adequacy of follow up).

4,analysis0,"A generic inverse-variance method with random-effects model was used to pool the outcome data for Mediterranean diet score as categorical variables (medium vs. low, high vs. low) and continuous variable. Between-study heterogeneity was examined by the Q test and I2 statistic. I2 statistic higher than 50% was indicated as significant heterogeneity46. Additionally, we performed the stratified meta-analysis based on the pre-specified characteristics as follows: type of cognitive disorders (mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, dementia), study location (US, non-US), gender (male, female, both sexes), duration of follow-up (<5 years, ≥5 years), and exposure assessment method (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), others). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the influence of a single article on the overall pooled analysis.

5,analysis1,"  We further estimate the possible dose-response patterns of Mediterranean diet score on the risk of developing cognitive disorders. Generalized least-squares trend estimation (Generalized least squares trend estimation (GLST)) model was used to calculate the study-specific slopes4950. For categories of the Mediterranean diet score that were open (e.g., 4–6 scores), we assigned the mean values as the corresponding score of Mediterranean diet. If a study did not use the 9-point scale of Mediterranean diet score, we converted the score to the 9-point scale. If the number of cases for each category was not reported, we used the RRs to obtain a summary estimate51. The dose-response results in the forest plots were presented for every one score increment in Mediterranean diet. A three-knot restricted cubic spline model was used to test for non-linearity hypothesis in the association.",49735a33-4574-4468-a249-4f275707e681
6,analysis2," If the test for the non-linear association was not statistically significant, a Generalized least squares trend estimation (GLST) model without the restricted cubic spline was used to test the linear hypothesis.  All statistical analyses were conducted with the STATA software (version 12.0) and the Review Manager software (version 5.2). A two-tailed P value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.  Additional Information How to cite this article: Wu, L. and Sun, D.

19,discussion0,"The present systematic review and meta-analysis identified 9 cohort studies involving a total number of 34,168 participants. Compared with the lowest category of Mediterranean diet score, the pooled analysis showed that the highest Mediterranean diet score was inversely associated with the developing of cognitive disorders; however, Mediterranean diet score of the median category was not significantly associated with the incident risk of cognitive disorders. The dose-response analysis indicated a trend of a linear relationship of the Mediterranean diet score with the incident risk of cognitive disorders, but the association was not significant. In addition, there might be difference of the association between different gender and follow-up duration.  It is biologically plausible that Mediterranean diet is related to the decreased risk of the occurrence of cognitive disorders. First, a Mediterranean-like diet has been considered as a protective factor against many chronic diseases.",9614a7fb-639b-4ef4-bfd4-4f24999473b3
20,discussion1," By lowering the important risk factors and comorbidities of cardiovascular diseases, such as high blood pressure, dyslipidemia and diabetes, the proposed cardio-protective effect of Mediterranean diet may be an important pathway for the protective effect of Mediterranean diet on cognition24252627. The PREDIMED study conducted a randomized trial to evaluate the association between adherence to Mediterranean diet pattern and cardiovascular risk28, they found that the risk of stroke was significantly reduced in the two intervention groups. Hemorrhagic stroke is a known risk factor of dementia; as a result, adherence to Mediterranean diet is also likely to be associated with the lower risk of cognitive disorders. In fact, a randomized clinical trial has directly demonstrated that a Mediterranean-style supplemented diet was significantly improved the cognitive function in a Spanish older population29.",6af136fb-61cb-49cd-b6b5-8292c9ca5e9e
21,discussion2," Second, dietary component, such as fruit, vegetables, cereals, alcohol and unsaturated fatty acids in the Mediterranean diet have been demonstrated to be associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline303132. As a mixture of these beneficial components, Mediterranean diet may also play a protective role against cognitive decline. Third, It is reported that adherence to Mediterranean diet was related to lower levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin3334. The neuro-protective effects of Mediterranean diet may relate to its ability of reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, which are also linked to the pathophysiology of degenerative disease3536.  The robustness of our finding was demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis. Only 1 included study did not adjust for the variable of ApoEε4 gene type in the multivariate statistical model, and the ApoEε4 gene is considered as an unequivocal risk factor of cognitive disorders37.",02eedcfa-a6ca-4ddc-803c-075228734e18
22,discussion3," Therefore, Mediterranean diet might be interpreted as an independent protective factor of cognitive disorders. The gender-difference of the association in the stratified study might be attributed to the non-significant result in the individual study. Both the study included only males13 and the study included only females15 reported a non-significant association between Mediterranean diet score and cognitive disorders. We speculated that the study population from the well-educated, middle- to high-income white women might dilute the association between Mediterranean diet and cognitive disorders15. Olive oil was a key component in the original Mediterranean diet score and has been demonstrated to have significantly improved the cognitive function in prospective studies3839. The male participants in the study by Olsson et al.",eb9d16a3-40de-47ba-935c-e7dadfee2cf7
23,discussion4," consumed relatively lower amount of olive oil compared with other studies, and thus this may reduce the beneficial role of Mediterranean diet in the prevention of cognitive disorders15. It is worth mention that the inverse association of Mediterranean diet and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was observed, but the association was not detected in the incident risk of dementia in the present study. We inferred that a Mediterranean-style diet may delay the progression of cognitive decline at the early stage of the cognitive impairment/decline. However, the Mediterranean diet would be unable to modify or delay the dementia onset preceding the clinical diagnosis.  Major strengths of the present systematic review and meta-analysis are the longitudinal design of the included articles. It is feasible to pool the effect sizes on account of the absence of statistical heterogeneity.",4ac6b703-e5ac-4086-b8b4-fd131ecaa922
24,discussion5," Although several quantitative meta-analyses have reported the association between Mediterranean diet and cognitive disorders9101112, an additional 4 cohort studies with 25,864 participants were included in the present study compared with the last published meta-analysis in this topic. Furthermore, this is the first attempt to quantify the potential dose-response patterns of Mediterranean diet score on the risk of developing cognitive disorders. An approximately linear relationship of Mediterranean diet score and cognitive disorders was observed.  However, our study has limitations. First, articles provided the Mediterranean score were all included in the pooled analysis, and thus we included one study using other strategy to define the Mediterranean diet score (0–55 points). Although this study did not significantly change the overall pooled analysis in the sensitivity analysis, possible biases might have existed.",a0609471-7d0b-41bb-ae16-54de452067e1
25,discussion6," Second, although Mediterranean diet score has been regarded as a reliable tool to measure the adherence of the Mediterranean-style diet40, measurement bias might have been given. Mediterranean diet has been evaluated in many different ways across studies, and these studies may use different versions to measure the individual component of the Mediterranean diet41. For instance, a low consumer from one study could be considered as high consumer in another study and vice versa, and this may have caused misclassification42. This could also explain the reason why we observed slightly different results from different regions. Detailed descriptions of the Mediterranean diet were poorly reported in the included studies, and thus this limited us to do further analysis to evaluate the effects of Mediterranean diet on cognitive disorders. Third, lifestyle and dietary habits were different among various regions.",b901587c-64d3-4c73-ad93-cb8680aa889d
26,discussion7," Changes in available year-round fruit, vegetables and other foods may have affected our results. Third, we extracted the data with the largest number of adjusted covariates in the multivariate statistical models; however, other unmeasured variables may also exist. Considering the complexity of the eating, lifestyle and environmental factors, it is difficult to identify the independent impact of a dietary pattern from other confounding variables. Fourth, the follow-up duration in most of the included studies was relatively short, and this may bring bias to our study. Finally, because of the observational nature of the present study, a causal association between Mediterranean diet and cognitive disorders cannot be established. Therefore, the pooled results of our study should be interpreted with caution. More conclusive evidence is needed to detect the causal effects of the Mediterranean diet on the occurrence of cognitive disorders.",47794f07-2ee3-4ef0-a855-dcd4f5c0039c
27,discussion8,"  Conclusion In summary, the results from the present updated systematic review and meta-analysis provide significant evidence of an inverse association between Mediterranean diet and the risk of developing cognitive disorders. Further studies of randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm the observed association in different populations. ",b8498bff-f671-47ca-91c5-45d80040d826
