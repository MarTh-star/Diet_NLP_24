0,methods0,"4.1. C. elegans Strains and Culture Conditions The wild type C. elegans strain N2 (Var. Bristol), the transgenic C. elegans strain OW13 (grk-1(ok1239), pkIs2386 [unc-54p::α-synuclein::YFP + unc-119(+)]), as well as the E. coli OP50 feeding strain were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre, University of Minnesota (Minneapolis, MN, USA). The C. elegans strain UA44 (baIn11[Pdat-1::α-synuclein, Pdat-1::GFP]) was kindly provided by the Caldwell laboratory, University of Alabama (Tuscaloosa, AL, USA) [118]. C. elegans wild type and transgenic strains were grown on standard nematode growth medium (nematode growth medium (NGM)) at 22 °C, seeded with E. coli OP50 and maintained following standard protocols as described previously [119]. Prior to all tests, synchronous L1 larvae were obtained via “egg prep” by strongly shaking at least 2000 young adults for about 4 min in 10 mL bleaching solution (0.5 mL NaOH (10 M), 2.5 mL sodium hypochlorite-solution (12%), and 7 mL bidest water).",1db325b8-5644-4ddb-a607-e5a3d3154dc8
1,methods1," After washing with M9 buffer at least three times, the resulting egg pellet was slightly shaken overnight in 4 mL M9 buffer. The following day, the hatched L1 larvae were distributed to nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with OP50. Forty-eight hours later, L4 larvae were transferred to treatment plates as described below. 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (FUdR; Tokyo Chemical Industry, Eschborn, Germany) was used to inhibit fertilization [120] and was dropped onto each plate with a final concentration of 100 µM (according to agar volume).   4.2. Polyphenol and Rotenone Treatment The treatment plates were prepared with the polyphenols oleuropein aglycone (Extrasynthese) and hydroxytyrosol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Glycated oleuropein was de-glycosylated by treatment with almond β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21, Fluka, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as previously described [121], with minor modifications. Briefly, 10 mM oleuropein in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.",c87f5715-a72f-472d-889f-d1617bde427c
2,methods2,"0) was incubated overnight with β-glucosidase (8.9 I.U.) at RT. Then, the reaction mixture was centrifuged, the precipitate re-suspended in 50% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and the solution kept frozen. Complete deglycosylation was assessed by assaying the released glucose. HT powder was dissolved in bidest water at 60 mg/mL and the solution stored at −20 °C. oleuropein aglycone (OLE) and HT were added to the bacteria and agar at a final concentration of 30 μg/mL, 100 μg/mL, 250 μg/mL, or 500 μg/mL, respectively. A final concentration of 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (for oleuropein aglycone (OLE) assays) or equal amounts of bidest water (for HT assays) were applied in all treatment and control plates as well as feeding bacteria.   To trigger the Parkinsonian-related phenotype, wild type nematodes were treated with rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). A stock solution of 0.",0fbe58f3-f219-4cb5-b165-8e0bcb738bb6
3,methods3,"5 mg/mL rotenone was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added with a final concentration of 10 µM to the control and polyphenol plates. After distribution with a spatula and drying for 24 h in the dark, OP50, including 10 µM rotenone and the respective polyphenol, was spread on the plates. L4 nematodes were transferred to the rotenone plates until they were used for bioassays.  4.3. Lifespan and Heat Stress Assay Synchronized wild-type nematodes were observed and scored for their survival throughout their lifespan. The animals were counted daily from the first day of adulthood until all died. To assess the viability of the nematodes, they were first gently touched with a platinum wire at the tail and the head. If no movements were recognizable, the pharyngeal pumping was observed. The worms were considered dead when none of these movements were recognizable. The nematodes at the edge of the plate or in the depth of the agar were considered lost and excluded from the count.",8845f3b0-58e0-4b45-8e1c-35a42f918f28
4,methods4,"  The heat stress test was performed according to the lifespan protocol with the difference that nematodes at the third day of adulthood were stressed for 3 h at 37 °C and counting of dead and alive worms started 1 day after stress exposure.   4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis For the fluorescence observation, the nematodes were placed on a 2% agar pad on a microscope slide and anesthetized with 4 µL NaN3 (1M). The images were taken with the aid of the Axioskop fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and filter set 13 from the Zeiss 4880 series (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Nematodes with a ruptured vulva phenotype were excluded from analysis. The images were captured and analysed on the 3rd, 7th or 12th day of adulthood, respectively.  Wild type nematodes were analysed to determine and quantify ageing-related pigment accumulation. The images were captured at 100x magnification and a red filterset (TRITC, 545/30 nm ex, 610/70 nm em) was used.",2fac14d1-e632-4609-ad30-c16eacf8f6f0
5,methods5," It was necessary to acquire additional images in a bright field, because of the poor visibility of the body contour in the dark field. The images in the bright field were used to delineate the perimeter of the worm to which the dark field image was overlayed by the CellProfiler Software (Version 3.1.9; Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA) [122,123]. The quantification of age-related pigment accumulation was expressed by the mean intensity of the red fluorescence per total worm body.  The OW13 transgenic strain features yellow fluorescent protein linked to α-synuclein in the body wall muscle cells. Therefore, the nematodes were monitored using a yellow barrier filter with 100x magnification to quantify the light emission proportional to the amount of accumulation of the pathological protein. The images were processed using the CellProfiler software, and the yellow fluorescence intensity emitted per total worm body was calculated.",46c50e10-43f5-4f14-9481-648d0c63c992
6,methods6,"  The UA44 transgenic strain features GFP linked to the dopamine transporter in the six dopaminergic neurons of the head and two in the tail as well as harmful α-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons. The green fluorescence intensity represents the vitality of the neurons, therefore, the green barrier filter was used for the analysis. The number of detectable anterior neurons was counted at the microscope with 200x magnification. In addition, individual images of the head were captured. The nematodes were assayed for patterns of degeneration at indicated time points, as described previously from Harrington, et al. [68].  4.5. Swim Behaviour Assay The study of locomotion was realized with a swim assay according to Restif et al. [61] and Ibáñez–Ventoso et al. [124]. Wells with a depth of 0.5 mm and Ø 10 mm were created with two self-adhesive marking films for microscope slides and filled with M9 buffer.",f52fc521-ebf8-4a67-8abe-e361ef6fde09
7,methods7," Five to 10 nematodes were transferred per well and covered by a cover slip to facilitate visualization and recorded with a connected camera. Nematodes with a ruptured vulva phenotype were excluded from analysis. The analysis was conducted with wild type nematodes at the 3rd, 7th, and 12th day of adulthood. Furthermore, wild type rotenone-treated worms and the strains OW13 and UA44 were analysed at the 3rd and 7th day of adulthood. Each video was converted into single frames and processed with Photoshop (version 19.1.7; Adobe Inc., San José, CA, USA) to meet the required settings. Thereafter, pictures were analysed with the CeleST software (version 3.1; distributed by GitHub Pages, https://github.com/DCS-LCSR/CeleST, accessed on 08 April 2020) as described by Restif et al. [61] and Ibáñez–Ventoso, et al. [124]. The thrashing rate, the body wave number and the activity index were evaluated as representative parameters of motor activity.  4.6.",6f4b87d3-be06-462e-a0ec-b47247d4f96f
8,methods8," Statistical Analysis All experiments were independently conducted at least two times. The Online Application for Survival Analysis (OASIS 2; https://sbi.postech.ac.kr/oasis2/, accessed on 8 April 2020) [125] was used for comparing survival differences between two conditions. Fluorescence intensities as well as swim behaviour parameters were calculated as mean ± SEM, and statistical significance was calculated by a two-tailed t-test using GraphPad (https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/, accessed on 8 April 2020). Chi-square test was used to compare the number of worms with intact and degenerated neurons in the UA44 strain.   5. Conclusions Due to their different actions in terms of lifespan during non-stressful conditions, disparate modes of actions could be the underlying cause of the beneficial characteristics of the olive polyphenols oleuropein aglycone (OLE) and HT.",d9d58ae3-26d3-456a-8419-6a350f6611be
9,methods9," Accordingly, possible additive or even synergistic effects by combining both polyphenols should be studied in the future. Intense research in the last decade has provided increasing knowledge of the biochemical and cell biology basis of the beneficial effects of plant, notably olive polyphenols. Such growing information indicates that these polyphenols have the potential as promising tools to be used to develop new therapeutic and preventive approaches against ageing and ageing-associated neurodegenerative diseases. However, even though C. elegans and mammalian models are frequently used to test possible human treatments, human clinical trials are still needed to verify this assumption.
