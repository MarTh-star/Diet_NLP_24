0,introduction0,"In older adults, several cohort studies have shown that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower mortality.[1–3] Moreover, the Mediterranean diet has been linked to lower risk of death among the elderly surviving a myocardial infarction.[4] There is also evidence that this dietary pattern is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases,[5] cancer, and depression,[6;7] although most of these studies were not conducted specifically in older adults.  As the population gets older, health outcomes like health-related quality of life (health related quality of life (HRQL)) or life satisfaction become progressively more important.[8] Thus, for many older adults who already have one or several chronic diseases, the subjective impact of the improvement or deterioration of their physical or mental health can be as important as a diagnosis of a new medical condition.",c3271933-7058-4cd1-a6cc-7a2610add5a2
1,introduction1,"  However, only a few studies have examined the association of a whole dietary pattern with health related quality of life (HRQL) in adults. A small substudy of the DASH trial assessed the effect of a ""combination diet"", which emphasized fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, versus the typical American diet; after 8 weeks of follow-up the 28 participants randomly assigned to the ""combination diet"" modestly improved their health related quality of life (HRQL) compared to the control group.[9] In addition, three observational studies have found a slightly better health related quality of life (HRQL) associated with the Mediterranean diet.[10–12] However, two of these studies were of a cross-sectional design and included individuals over the age of 35.",85e00d0e-961d-4e7b-bc4b-9b93707752eb
2,introduction2," [10;12] And the third one was based on a prospective follow-up of relatively young subjects (mean age around 40) but did not assess health related quality of life (HRQL) at baseline;[11] thus, the beneficial effect of the Mediterranean diet on health related quality of life (HRQL) could be partly due to differences in baseline physical and mental health status across categories of adherence to the Mediterranean diet.  To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to examine the association between the Mediterranean diet and health related quality of life (HRQL) in older adults; it used data from two cohorts of elderly people with measures of diet at baseline, and measures of health related quality of life (HRQL) at baseline and at the end of follow-up.

3,methods0,"Study design and participants We analyzed data from two cohorts of community-dwelling individuals aged ≥60 years in Spain. The first one was the UAM-cohort, including 4008 individuals selected in 2000–2001.[13;14] Information was collected at the participants’ homes by personal interview and a physical examination, performed by trained staff. In 2003, an attempt was made to contact the study participants again; contact was successful in 3235 (80.7%) individuals and the information was obtained by a phone interview. The second cohort was the Seniors-ENRICA, which included 2519 individuals recruited in 2008–2010 who underwent a personal interview and a physical exam, and provided blood and urine samples in their households.[15;16] In 2012, 2037 (80.9%) participants were contacted again and reported updated information through a phone interview.

4,methods1," Both studies were approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of La Paz University Hospital in Madrid.  Study variables Diet In the UAM-cohort diet information was obtained by a simplified 14-item food frequency questionnaire, based on a validated instrument, which included standard portions of foods and the following response categories: every day, three to five days per week, one to two days per week, or never.[17;18] This information was used to construct a Mediterranean dietary pattern index (UAM-MDP) comprising 8 items, where individuals were assigned +1 point for each one of the following dietary consumptions: fruit every day, vegetables every day, whole grains every day, vegetable oils every day, and fish at least three days per week. Moderate alcohol consumption, defined as an intake of <30 g/day of alcohol in men and <20 g/day in women, also scored +1.",f658f6ca-d487-4bf2-8339-ced238dc48ea
5,methods2," Participants scored -1 point for each one of the following consumptions: red or processed meat every day, and animal fats (butter, lard, etc.) every day. The index ranges from -2 to 6, and a lower score indicates a less healthy diet.  In the Seniors-ENRICA cohort, diet was measured with a computerized and validated diet history developed from that used in the EPIC-cohort in Spain.[19;20] Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed with the PREDIMED score [21] and the Trichopoulou’s Mediterranenan Diet score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MSD)).[22] The PREDIMED score of 14 items.",250b44b3-45b9-4bee-87f4-b2f5d4124afa

A value of +1 was assigned to each target achieved. A higher score indicates better Mediterranean diet adherence (range 0–14).",bb31a69f-45b9-4dfe-b6ca-0da309277c48
7,methods4," In the MDS, the intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, grains, fish, and a high ratio of monounsaturated/saturated fatty acids are considered beneficial, thus a value of 1 is assigned to a consumption above the sex-specific median in the study sample; in contrast, intake of red meat and poultry, and dairy products is considered detrimental, and a value of 0 is assigned to consumption above the sex-specific median. Moderate alcohol consumption is also considered beneficial: 1 point is assigned to intake of 10–50 g/day in men and 5–25 g/day in women. The range in this index is 0 (lowest) to 9 (highest Mediterranean diet adherence).  health related quality of life (HRQL) In the UAM-cohort, health related quality of life (HRQL) was measured with the Spanish version of the SF-36 questionnaire, which has shown good validity and reproducibility in the Spanish population.[23–25] In the Seniors-ENRICA cohort, the Spanish version of the SF-12v2 was used.",c0a538b7-d759-43cb-b079-e78ecdd86be0
8,methods5," This is a shortened version of the SF-36 which has also been validated in Spain.[26;27]  Both questionnaires measure eight dimensions of health related quality of life (HRQL): physical function, physical role, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role and mental health. Each dimension has a score from 0 to 100. Information on the eight health dimensions can be summarized by two global health related quality of life (HRQL) indicators: the physical component summary (physical component summary (PCS)) and the mental component summary (mental component summary (MCS)). The physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores are standardized to a national norm with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10; this allows comparisons of the scores for each study participant against the mean score in the Spanish population.",4c90b559-43d5-4417-9934-8cc673ed6117

Potential confounders In the two cohorts, data on a number of potential confounders were collected at baseline. Specifically, information was obtained on age, sex, level of education (primary or lower, secondary, and university studies), and tobacco smoking (never-, current-, and former-smoker). Weight, height and waist circumference were measured by trained staff using standardized techniques with the subject barefoot and wearing light clothing. Body mass index was calculated as weight in kg divided by squared height in m, and grouped into three categories: normal weight (≤25 kg/m2), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2), and obesity (≥ 30 kg/m2).

10,methods7," In the UAM-cohort, a single question was used to obtain leisure time physical activity, which was classified as none, occasional physical activity, and regular physical activity.[30] In the Seniors-ENRICA, activity in leisure time was obtained with the questionnaire developed by the EPIC-cohort in Spain and was expressed in METs h/week.[31] Individuals were also asked about the time spent watching television (hours/week).  In each cohort, blood pressure was measured with validated tensiometers under standardized conditions, and hypertension was defined as systolic pressure ≥140 mmHg, diastolic pressure ≥90 mmHg or use of antihypertensive drugs. In the UAM-cohort, individuals reported whether they had ever been diagnosed by a physician with any of the following diseases: diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer at any site, and depression requiring drug treatment.",50961ac3-15a5-43b8-a6e4-5477885e55a3

Results were generally consistent in both cohorts despite the studies were performed 10 years apart, different instruments to measure health related quality of life (HRQL) were used, and 3 distinct indexes for measuring the Mediterranean diet were computed. Although the 3 indexes focused on the consumption of fruits, vegetables, meat and fish, the UAM-MDP index was based on normative goals of consumption while the MDS used food consumption medians, which are population-specific. Moreover, the PREDIMED score uses normative goals, emphasizes monounsaturated fat intake, incorporates cooking techniques (e.g., sofrito), assesses consumption of sugary drinks, and includes a greater number of items than the other two indexes.",d056e7bf-b121-42d9-bd7f-fddb166e15fa
21,discussion1,"[32]  Our results were in line with those obtained in cross-sectional studies conducted in Spain and in Greece with younger populations. In these studies, a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with better health related quality of life (HRQL); however, the association was of small magnitude and it did not reach the conventional limits of clinical relevance (>3 points).[10–12] Specifically, in a study in Spain[10], an increase of 5 units in the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (range of 20) was associated with a 0.74-point higher mental component summary (MCS) score on the SF-12 in men and a 1.5-point-higher score in women In another study in Spain,11 where only the subscales of the SF-36 were computed, a 1-point increase in the MDS was associated with better vitality [beta coefficient (95% CI): 0.50 (0.32–0.68)] and general health [0.44 (0.26–0.52)].",35760201-1f56-4285-a4aa-c078bfdf842a
22,discussion2," Finally, in a Greek study,[12] a 1-point increase in the MDS was linked to slightly higher score on the physical component summary (PCS) [0.15 (0.06–0.24)] and the mental component summary (MCS) [0.33(0.18–0.49)] of the SF-36. However, these studies are difficult to compare because of the different components of the dietary indexes used and the lack of normative cut-offs for the intake of a specific food. In fact, in these studies the Mediterranean diet adherence was based on the median intake of the different food groups, which are population-specific.  Several clinical trials have assessed the effect of dietary interventions promoting a healthy diet on the health related quality of life (HRQL) of some types of patients.",b60d78ff-1fa8-40e7-a22a-578b19b5eded
23,discussion3," Specifically, a cholesterol-lowering diet did not improve mood among hypercholesterolemic patients;[33] a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet did not improve health related quality of life (HRQL) among patients with high cardiovascular risk; [34] and a low-fat diet intervention did not modify health related quality of life (HRQL) in women at high risk of breast cancer.[35] One possible explanation for these results is that, for many people, the prescription of a healthy diet is perceived as an unpleasant experience, which may counterbalance the beneficial health effects of these diets. Thus, efforts must be made to improve the palatability of healthy diets, for instance, by increasing the quality of foods, their affordability, and by promoting cooking skills.  There are several mechanisms by which diet may affect health, including the reduction of traditional cardiovascular risk factors,[36] the decrease of serum markers of inflammation,[37] and improvement of endothelial function.",9defef4d-8357-4b44-9ef8-45d8e04e067a
24,discussion4,"[38] However, most of these effects, including those on lowering blood pressure, cholesterolemia and glycemia, can be asymptomatic, and thus may have a small impact on health related quality of life (HRQL). By contrast, a high adherence to the Mediterranena diet index used in this study has previously shown an inverse association with general mortality after 10 years of follow-up in the UAM-cohort.[3] Consequently, regardless of its effects on health related quality of life (HRQL), the Mediterranean diet should be promoted among the elderly due to their benefits on other health variables.  Finally, the evidence of the influence of specific food components of the Mediterranean diet on health related quality of life (HRQL) is still limited. Although several studies have examined the association of consumption of fish,[39,40] fruit and vegetables,[41] and nuts[42]with health related quality of life (HRQL), these investigations were mostly cross-sectional or showed inconsistent results.",51fd522e-2894-405a-b184-853cd5bce4aa
25,discussion5,"[39,40] In addition, regular yogurt consumption, that is also considered healthy, has not shown an association with improved health related quality of life (HRQL) in a longitudinal study.[43]  Our study had several strengths. It used data from two independent cohorts, diet and health related quality of life (HRQL) were measured with validated instruments, and analyses were adjusted for many potential confounders, including health related quality of life (HRQL) and morbidity at baseline.  This study also had some limitations. Information on health related quality of life (HRQL) was lacking for 853 subjects in the UAM cohort, and its potential influence on study results is unknown.",f5949fa2-b933-473e-8ef1-c21e54d505c8
26,discussion6," Also in both cohorts diet was self-reported, which may result in some recall or social desirability bias and the ensuing non-differential misclassification of diet; this and some inaccuracies in other self-reported variables could have led to underestimate the association between the Mediterranean diet and health related quality of life (HRQL). Furthermore, in the UAM-cohort the consumption of vegetable oils but not of olive oil was recorded, and olive oil is considered one of the main components of the Mediterranean diet. However, olive oil is by far the oil most frequently used in Spain.[44] In addition, the SF-36 and the SF-12 are generic health related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaires, and they cannot capture some aspects of perceived health related to diet, such as satisfaction with food-related life,[45] the ability to eat independently, the ability to buy and cook the own food, or food palatability.",cff59228-b9d1-48a1-ac63-b8f82d0fc0d6
27,discussion7,"[8;46] Another potential limitation, which is shared with many cohort studies, is the unverified assumption that the dietary pattern registered at baseline is maintained throughout the follow-up; in fact incident diseases could have led to dietary changes, so that the results might not entirely be due to baseline diet. In addition, in both cohorts the duration of follow-up has been relatively short (median 3.5 years). However, in clinical trials with the Mediterranean diet, improvements in cardiovascular risk factors and in disease incidence and mortality were observed after a few months of follow-up.[47;48] Notwithstanding this, a longer follow-up might be needed to observe a beneficial effect of diet on health related quality of life (HRQL). Finally, because the Mediterranean diet is part of an overall lifestyle, a certain residual confounding cannot be ruled out.",2d5b3b4b-5805-4b67-923a-8a48eabe772a
28,discussion8," Also, maintaining a good health throughout the aging process could lead to higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet; thus, despite the longitudinal study design, the observed results could partly reflect reverse causation.  In conclusion, although adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been associated with lower mortality among the elderly in some Mediterranean countries, it does not seem to be associated with a clinically relevant improvement in health related quality of life (HRQL). However, since some aspects of the impact of diet on health related quality of life (HRQL) may not have been captured with the SF-36 and the SF-12 questionnaires, further research should be conducted using comprehensive diet-specific health related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaires in the elderly. =",13cf2761-3488-4f9f-9524-b4e8ab0b7712
