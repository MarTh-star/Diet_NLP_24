The trial was conducted according to the principles of Helsinki Declaration (1964) and was in line with terms of Good Clinical Practice. ClinicalTrials.gov registry: NCT04876560.  2.2. Participants  Adult BC outpatients of IASO HOSPITAL in Athens-Greece were initially invited to take part in the study through an announcement at the hospital’s web site. Patients, who showed interest in participating, attended personal meetings with the appointed dieticians who explained in detail the aims, methods and the potential benefits/risks of the study. A leaflet with related information was provided to all patients. Before recruitment, each eligible volunteer signed a written informed consent and then kept a hard copy of the signed document. All eligible patients were recruited from March to June 2020.",543816d7-970c-42cd-a2f3-07c00524cbdc

Study Design  A team of scientists (pharmacists, dieticians, physicians, liberal art and marketing communications consultants) at IASO HOSPITAL (Athens, Greece) developed a food database Clinical decision support systems (CDSS), that could provide the following services: (I) nutritional status assessment (screening); (II) individual dietary plans according to patients’ needs; (III) nutritional goals and guidelines, coupled with appropriate definitions, explanations and healthy dietary practices; (IV) physical activity goals; (V) monitoring nutritional and physical activity goals.",e73d50af-f6fb-41a7-aa67-6ed302e33fa5
3,methods3," In the present study, the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) intended to assist BC patients with lifestyle modifications through the implementation of the Mediterranean diet (MD) and increase of physical activity. The Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) was developed in 2016 and ever since, it has been applied in clinical practice to assist dieticians in patient nutritional screening. However, this is the first time that individuals themselves got access to Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) from home, as a means of guidance to comply with lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The present study was a parallel group, single centered, 3-month intervention trial in which a computer-generated simple randomisation sequence was implemented. The leading investigator recorded the code number along with the type of treatment for each participant and sealed data into an envelope.",e6c40df5-4d6b-46f9-a04a-165bbffae052
4,methods4," Allocation to treatment was blinded to the data scientist until the assessment of study results.  Enrolled BC patients were assigned to either the Control or the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) (intervention) group. At baseline before the start of the trial (time 0), each enrolled participant completed a personal interview with the appointed dieticians. In the Intervention group (Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) group), patients received a personalised daily dietary plan (specific meals, products, recipes, food portions in grams) based on MD together with physical activity guidelines, all generated by the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated by the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS), as the ratio of the average recorded weight (kg) to the square of average height (m2) [28].",94138539-d582-4ece-98f6-f98572d6bbef
5,methods5," The Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) estimated Total daily Energy Expenditure (Total daily Energy Expenditure (TEE)) (Figure S1) according to individual’s basic metabolic rate (Harris–Benedict equation) and physical activity levels [29,30]. To this point, there was a “Lifestyle” section in the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) (Figure S2), in which physical activity status was distinguished in five categories, i.e., “Limitation to activities due to disability”, “Low active”, “Moderately active”, “Active” and “Vigorous active”. A detailed description, including hours of sitting and exercising and even kind of exercises, was recorded for each category.",49945582-1489-47ea-b854-e8019ba276e4
6,methods6," The concept of metabolic equivalent (metabolic equivalent (MET)) was used to evaluate physical activity intensity [30] The Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) also assessed nutritional status using the “Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool” (MUST) (Figure S3), in order to identify adults who were at risk of malnutrition (undernutrition), malnourished or obese [31]. Overweight and obese BC patients received a hypocaloric diet, in which daily energy intake was less than Total daily Energy Expenditure (TEE) by approximately -500 kcal/day. Daily nutrient distribution was calculated by the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) taking into consideration the traditional MD pattern along with patients’ needs. More specifically, total protein intake ranged between 1.0 and 1.5 g per kg of body weight (BW).",f8b1d6ea-b6bb-4d57-bba9-f8f474c545b4
7,methods7," Total fat intake accounted for about 30% of total energy input and comprised less than 10% saturated fatty acids (SFAs), about 10% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and about 10% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The daily amount of fiber consumption accounted for 20–30 g. Other health issues such as constipation, diarrhoea or gastro-esophageal reflux were also assessed by the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) for the formulation of the dietetic scheme. Furthermore, the dieticians provided nutritional consultation on MD [32]. Patients were trained to use the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and received individual login passwords allowing access to their personal profile from home. During the trial, BC women were instructed to record food diaries in the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) every week (at least 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day), which were also made available to the dieticians (remotely).",b5bc7d9e-6c6f-4074-b1d0-b4f8e00bf3bb
8,methods8," Visiting the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS), patients had the opportunity to track their progress, e.g., monitoring goals of body weight, physical activity, consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes. Regular phone interviews were scheduled every 15 days to assist nutritional and lifestyle consultation, while unexpected phone calls were made to receive 24-hour dietary records.  The Control arm received general lifestyle advice according to “American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention” [33] via scheduled phone interviews every 15 days. Food diaries of each week (at least 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) were sent via emails and unexpected phone calls were made to receive 24-h dietary records as well.  Throughout the intervention, each patient (of both groups) conducted two personal sessions with the appointed investigators, one at the trial initiation and one at 3 months (end of the study).  2.4.",12054f41-cb9d-4f07-bef5-0b9525a81128
9,methods9," Assessments  Medical record: General information (date of birth, smoking habits, allergies, gastrointestinal problems, other health issues), as well as detailed data on type and stage of breast cancer, performed surgery, hormone treatment and symptomatology were recorded for each patient by the appointed oncologist.  Food data: To evaluate dietary patterns a Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) was applied to all participants [34]. The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) assessed frequency of consumption (within a month) and portion sizes of foods and drinks typically consumed in MD. Pictures and food models were demonstrated to facilitate estimation of portion sizes. Nutrient intake was estimated by the collected food diaries and the 24-h dietary records using the Diet Analysis Plus software (version 6.1, Esha Research, Salem, MA, USA). The MedDietScore questionnaire estimated the degree of adherence to MD at the start of the study and at 3 months [35].",93f5c83f-99f2-4975-b70c-5d08fdd63802
10,methods10," Scoring ranges from “0” to “55” and higher scores signify greater MD adherence.  Questionnaires: The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)) performance status (PS) was used to estimate patients’ general functional capacity and ability to perform daily activities [27]. The questionnaire comprises 5 point scores ranging from “0”, fully active, to “4”, completely disabled. A good PS corresponds to scoring “0” or “1"" and indicates well-functioning [27]. Physical activity was assessed by the “International Physical Activity Questionnaire”. It evaluates frequency (number of days) and duration (minutes per day) of performed physical activities, including walking, vigorous and moderate intensity exercises, as well as sitting hours, during the last 7 days prior to screening [36]. Physical activity levels were expressed as metabolic equivalent (MET)s-min per week.",bdb15f6c-038c-4add-867f-330cca129c49
11,methods11,"  Health related quality of life was evaluated by two validated questionnaires: (a) the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and (b) the breast cancer supplementary module, EORTC QLQ-BR23 [37]. The EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3.0, EORTC Data Center, Brussels, Belgium) comprises 30 items in blocks of three different scales: (i) global health status / quality of life (Qol), (ii) functional and (iii) symptom scales [37]. The EORTC QLQ-BR23 (EORTC Data Center, Brussels, Belgium) incorporates 23 items evaluating functional characteristics and symptomatology that are BC-specific, namely body image, sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, future perspective, systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms and distress from hair loss [37]. Each item of EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 was transformed on a 0–100 scale.",0a8de93a-5e1b-4ce1-a2f1-fd98623a9bb9
12,methods12," Greater scores for functional scales and global health status/Qol, and lower scores on symptomatology indicate overall good health and well-being. To this end, responses to financial difficulties, sexual enjoyment and feeling towards hair loss were not analysed in the present study, since over 50% of the enrolled participants refused to answer the corresponding items. Furthermore, we implemented the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) to assess patients’ psychological distress [38]. It includes 14 self-assessed items of which seven questions are depression-specific and seven questions are anxiety-specific. Scoring ranges from “0”to “21” for each category and scores higher than “7” indicate possible cases of anxiety or depression, respectively [39]. All assessments (excluding Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS) were performed at baseline (time 0) and at 3 months (follow up).",cc63622e-a155-4baf-8905-dd6411d27b84
13,methods13,"  Anthropometric measurements: The BOD POD, an air displacement plethysmography device (BOD POD® Body Composition Tracking Systems, Life Measurement, Inc., Rome, Italy), was applied to measure body weight (BW) and body fat mass (body fat mass (BFM)) as has been previously described [32]. Patients’ height was recorded to the nearest millimeter using a standard stadiometer. Waist circumference (WC) was measured to the nearest millimeter at the midpoint between the lower margin of the last palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest with a stretch-resistant measuring tape. We calculated body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) by dividing body mass (kg) to the square of height (m2), in order to define overweight and obese patients. All measurements were performed in the morning after overnight fasting both at study initiation and at 3 months.",ee910ca3-fe9d-4cd8-b097-248c177f89bc
14,methods14,"  Blood indices: After overnight fasting, blood samples (~20 mL) were drawn from each patient at 0 and 3 months placing a catheter in an antecubital vein. Blood collection tubes containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)) were used for plasma separation. Whole blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature to isolate sera. Centrifugation was set at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Freshly isolated plasma or serum samples were used for all analyses.  A biochemical analyser (Cobas 8000 modular analyser, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was used to determine serum glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)), high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) and triacylglycerol levels.",9f53f63c-d415-4515-87e3-16337d7e44e8

Levels of plasma ascorbic acid (vitamin C) were measured by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)), as has been previously described [32]. Concentration less than 1.94 mg/L determined vitamin C deficiency [41]. Plasma malondialdehyde (malondialdehyde (MDA)) levels were measured to assess lipid peroxidation based on the method of Placer et al. [42]. A red pigment was formed by the reaction of malondialdehyde (MDA) with thiobarbituric acid, and the absorbance was read at 532 nm. Plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were expressed as nmol/mL.  2.5.",3ffa3fbb-e39f-4e0a-af5c-93a91ce5f3f5
16,methods16," Primary Outcome and Sample Size Calculation  Our primary outcome was the detection of a significant increase of the Mediterranean diet adherence (assessed by the MD score) and the global health, quality of life (assessed by EORTC-QLQ C30) in the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) arm compared to control at study endpoint. A minimum sample size of 32 patients (16 per arm) was sufficient to result in a clinically important difference of 4 in MD [standard deviation of mean (SD) = 4] and 10 in global health, quality of life (SD = 10) using a two-tailed t test with 80% power and a 5% level of significance. Secondary outcomes were significant changes in nutrient intake (i.e., saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, dietary fibers and vitamin C), cardiovascular risk factors including BW, WC, body mass index (BMI), total serum cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides acids and lipid peroxidation (i.e.",dec2a619-3688-4215-90ea-70745a46879c

Descriptive statistics was performed for all assessed markers and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was implemented to investigate normality of distribution. Continuous variables were presented as mean values ± SD and quantitative variables as absolute and relative frequencies. For the comparison of mean changes between the control and intervention group we computed the Student’s t-test for normally distributed variables or the Mann–Whitney U test for those not normally distributed. Intra-group differences were detected by the paired samples t-test or the Wilcoxon test. Level of statistical significance was set at 0.05.  3.

18,methods18," Finally, 22 patients in each group (Control and Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) group) were included in final analyses (Figure 1). All participants had Greek nationality and were residents of Attica (Greece). As shown in Table 1, all volunteers reported a good performance status as indicated by “0” Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS scoring. Moreover, 29.5% of enrolled participants were overweight, 39.6% were obese and 29.5% were current smokers. It is worth mentioning that 15 (68.2%) women of the control arm and 16 (72.7%) of the intervention group were postmenopausal at cancer diagnosis, but throughout the intervention all women were at a postmenopausal state.  At baseline (0 months), no significant differences were evident between the two BC arms in regards to anthropometrics, blood markers and dietary intake (Table 1). Reported data on health-related quality of life and psychological distress are shown in Table 2.  3.1.",0948ca1b-3ff8-48f1-90aa-22298eb583cd
19,methods19," Dietary Intake and Circulating Vitamin C  At follow up (3 months), the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) group showed greater MedDietScore, higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and elevated fiber consumption compared to baseline (Table 3). On the other hand, the intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) was significantly reduced (p < 0.001). With regards to antioxidant vitamin C, the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) arm demonstrated greater dietary intake (p = 0.018) at 3 compared to 0 months, and this increase was significantly different from control group (p = 0.001).  3.2. Anthropometrics and Physical Activity  As indicated in Table 3, body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat mass (BFM)% and WC of enrolled patients in the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) arm decreased significantly compared to control group (p < 0.001) at the endpoint of the trial.",8cf11a69-ccc7-44b8-a593-e3d8a1d9fb0a
20,methods20," On the contrary, physical activity levels of the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) group were raised at 3 months compared to time 0 (p = 0.001).

23,methods23," Discussion  In the present randomised controlled study, we evaluated for the first time, the effectiveness of a clinical decision support system (Clinical decision support systems (CDSS)) in implementing lifestyle modifications to breast cancer (BC) outpatients during the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic in Greece. According to individuals’ incorporated data, the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) generated a personalised nutritional plan based on the Mediterranean diet (MD) coupled with physical activity guidelines (Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) group). Our main outcome was a significantly increased MD adherence in the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) arm compared to control group who received general lifestyle guidelines.",ed022c2e-031d-47ac-ae4e-38387641cc9b
24,methods24," At 3 months, patients of the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) arm achieved better health related quality life, lower body weight (nearly 5%) and body fat mass, as well as regulated fasting blood glucose and lipid levels as compared to study initiation.  The MD is considered as a modifiable lifestyle factor that could affect the development of cancer [43]. In regards to BC, the potential protective effects of MD have attracted great attention, since prevalence of BC has been lower in the Mediterranean region than in Northern or Central European countries or the US [44]. Data from observational cohort studies suggest that adherence to MD is protective against BC development [45,46,47,48]. In the PREDIMED randomised controlled trial, which included 4282 women (60–80 years) being at high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, supplementation of MD with extra-virgin oil was beneficial in the prevention of primary BC [49].",868a35b2-b28f-4ada-b9b6-29da9b5def10
25,methods25,"  Furthermore, there is evidence that MD exerts beneficial effects in women already diagnosed with BC. In a recently published observational cohort study, 1453 BC women in northern Italy were followed-up for 15 years after initial diagnosis [50]. Results showed that patients being adherent to MD had a significantly better overall survival and lower all-cause mortality compared to those with poor MD adherence. This observed association between MD adherence and low overall mortality was more profound in older (≥ 55 years of age), postmenopausal and overweight/obese women. To this end, dietary fat reduction (fats, oils, sweets) and subsequent decrease of body weight in postmenopausal women with stage I or II BC, have shown to improve relapse-free survival rate [51]. The favorable effects of MD on disease prognosis are probably attributed to the additive health benefits of its nutritional components [52].",6f80462d-9322-4c9a-a82f-0772d3b7a527
26,methods26," High intake of dietary fiber has been strongly associated with a significant reduction in both all-cause and BC-specific mortality [53]. Elevated dietary intake of antioxidant vitamin C is beneficial on BC prognosis as well [54]. In our randomised controlled study, BC patients following a personalised Mediterranean dietary plan (Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) group) had significantly higher MedDietScore compared to patients of the control group. The intervention arm showed significant greater intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber and ascorbic acid than the control arm. In addition, consumption of saturated fatty acids was lower in the control arm. At the trial endpoint, the significant improvements in anthropometric characteristics of BC patients following MD (i.e. BW, body fat mass (BFM) and WC) were accompanied by regulation of fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and triacylglycerol levels.",6c986915-abdb-424d-805d-1b999af04c90
27,methods27," Physical activity levels (expressed as metabolic equivalent (MET)-mins/week) and blood high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration of the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) arm were significantly elevated at the end compared to the beginning of the trial, confirming the beneficial effects of lifestyle modification in breast cancer [55]. These potential beneficial effects of MD may be explained by a reduction in oxidative damage to lipids and DNA [56]. In the present study, patients of the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) arm showed lower lipid peroxidation (expressed as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels) and higher levels of circulating antioxidant vitamin C than the control arm.  It is well confirmed that cancer patients report declined functional capacity, increased pain and generally reduced quality of life, which may deteriorate treatment efficacy and lead to poor disease prognosis [57].",5b06c78b-ecd6-4630-9456-e87827827d4e
28,methods28," Dietary and lifestyle modification have been reported to ameliorate quality of life aspects in BC patients [57]. Likewise in our study, patients following MD for 3 months reported significant improvements in global health/quality of life, role functioning, emotional functioning, depression and anxiety, as well as trends of improvement in cognitive functioning, pain, insomnia, constipation and systemic therapy side effects.  All in all, the use of a food database Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) might be a promising tool for implementing a personalised dietary plan and lifestyle changes to breast cancer patients during challenging periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic minimising personal visits to healthcare settings. In this COVID era, Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) could enable the rise of virtual consultation, always within the scope for clinical effectiveness.",c8de1ecd-2a9c-4ccd-ad72-1e43a7ebd79f
29,methods29," Nevertheless, software technology has been successfully applied in the primary care before the virus pandemic [58]. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to assist clinicians in nutritional screening [58], as well as in promoting healthy weight management and prevention of cardiovascular diseases [24,25,26]. Taken these together with our results, Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are promising tools in assisting: (a) clinicians to provide nutritional care and (b) patients to engage with lifestyle modifications.  Study limitations: We recognise that the small sample size in our study may limit the power of analysis. However, all patients were consecutively recruited implementing strict inclusion / exclusion criteria to avoid bias. Furthermore, the high dropout rate (20%) may have caused violation of the randomisation principles and consequently alterations in the effect size. To this point, an intention-to-treat-analysis would be relevant.",30a60de7-0f8f-48b2-836c-a94be0b5ee1f
30,methods30," Nevertheless, per-protocol-analysis was conducted at it is preferred in small sample sized trials to quantify actual treatment effect [59]. For these reasons, results should be interpreted with caution. The outcomes of the present work are in agreement with previous large-scale studies in breast cancer women, which point out the potential health benefits of MD. Patients with limited computer skills may face difficulties in using the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS). To overcome this, all patients of the intervention group were properly trained and assisted when needed. We are also aware of the emerging concerns in controlled nutritional interventions, such as treatment contamination in the control group [60]. Finally, yet importantly, the use of self-reported tools such as food diaries could be a source of bias. In our study, all self-reporting tools were already validated.",e550920c-883e-427a-bbcc-8937214d0edf
31,methods31," Furthermore, the appointed dieticians were well experienced being able to detect unclear records and ask patients for proper clarifications.  5. Conclusions  We showed for the first time that the use of a food database clinical decision support system (Clinical decision support systems (CDSS)) could be a promising tool to assist breast cancer patients to comply with dietary and lifestyle modifications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on individuals’ needs, the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) produced a nutritional plan that was in line with the Mediterranean dietary pattern, together with physical activity guidelines. Following the Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) programme for 3 months, significant ameliorations in Mediterranean diet adherence, quality of life, as well as anthropometrics and blood indices were recorded.",25e84fd4-d581-46e2-b3b9-421370b571cc
32,methods32," During challenging periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the application of Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) could promote lifestyle changes in breast cancer patients minimising personal visits to healthcare settings and the risk to infection. To this end, larger-scale population studies are needed to investigate the potential beneficial effects of software-based technologies on the nutritional care of vulnerable populations such as cancer patients.
