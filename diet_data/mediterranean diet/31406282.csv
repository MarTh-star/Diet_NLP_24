0,introduction0,"Obesity is a global health problem that has long-term health repercussions and involves a chronic state of inflammation and increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer [1–3]. The World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) defines obesity as the abnormal or excessive accumulation of fat that can be harmful to health.  In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 41 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese (http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/childhood/es/), making obesity the most prevalent nutritional disorder in childhood.  It is known that obesity is a multifactorial entity influenced by environmental (including dietary habits and physical activity (PA)), psychosocial, and neuroendocrine status as well as genetics and epigenetics [4].",a4fd4b59-c298-4d05-9f8d-f9d5f12cba7e
1,introduction1," The increase in the prevalence of this pathology has led to an increase in the number of studies on its treatment and prevention, including some that study the influence of epigenetics in response to diet and predisposition to weight gain [5]. Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for the development of obesity. Many studies have demonstrated that obesity developed during infancy is associated with a high risk of being overweight in adult life [6]. However, obesity is phenotypically a very heterogeneous pathology and, concretely, includes the metabolically healthy obese (Metabolically healthy obesity (MHO)) phenotype. This phenotype describes individuals with obesity who do not meet the criteria of the metabolic syndrome [7]. They may have an epigenetic profile different than that of other phenotypes associated with obesity.",6628c67e-9a4f-44cd-b00e-d090c103894f
2,introduction2,"  Epigenetics is defined as inheritable and reversible phenomena that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence through DNA and histone protein modifications, including DNA methylation (DNAm, the most stable epigenetic modification), covalent histone modifications, chromatin folding, and the regulatory noncoding miRNAs. Epigenetic changes can modify gene transcription by altering the accessibility of gene transcription machinery [8, 9]. These changes are influenced by environmental factors such as nutrition, inflammation, hypoxia, PA, sex, and age, with these epigenetic changes acting as a regulator of the environment-gene interaction and the way the genome responds to lifestyle changes [10, 11].  Obesity is a multifactorial disease involving interactions between an individual’s genetic makeup and an unhealthy lifestyle (unhealthy food intake and sedentarism).",79430122-b46a-4be9-9492-39992497d327
3,introduction3," It is known that epigenetic modifications affect the expression of different metabolic genes, including lipid metabolism and inflammation genes involved in obesity pathogenesis. Identifying subjects who present with changes in DNAm could help to predict their susceptibility to gain or lose weight, thus helping to prevent obesity via the implementation of new therapeutic approaches [12–15].  A variety of genes have been proposed as candidates for methylation studies. Variations in the methylation profiles of various genes related to the metabolic pathway in obesity are associated with BMI, adiposity, and waist circumference (WC) [16].  The objective of this study was to analyze the methylation profile of genes involved in lipid metabolism after a personalized lifestyle modification based on the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and physical activity (PA), during 4-month and 12-month periods, in a prepubertal population of children with metabolically healthy obesity.

Student’s t test was used to compare quantitative variables whereas the chi-square test was used for qualitative variables in order to contrast variables measured within each group at different time periods. Bivariate correlations were determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient analysis. To calculate the sample size (calculated using SISA, Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis), we relied on other clinical studies that have shown the metabolic benefits of weight loss in the pediatric population with obesity [48]. Assuming a 95% confidence level (α error of 0.5%), a statistical power of 80%, and a 5% loss rate, a sample of 110 Metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) subjects was required.

Finally, SBP increased in the population as a whole (3.0 ± 0.8 mmHg), in this case due to a significant increase in SBP in girls (6.0 ± 0.6 mmHg).  In regard to the analytical parameters (Table 1B), after 12 months of the intervention, the entire population showed a statistically significant increase in fasting blood glucose (within normal range). Insulin levels and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) decreased after 12 months of intervention. The lipid profile also underwent several changes, although they were not statistically significant.

In addition, all components of the diet decreased significantly except for the consumption of fiber and vitamin D. Data on energy expenditure reflect significant variations in both levels of sedentarism as well as in light, moderate, and vigorous PA (Table 3) after the intervention. Sedentary time per day increased in the total population in a significant manner (p < 0.0001) while moderate and vigorous exercise time both increased as well.

18,discussion0,"Personalized lifestyle modification is a great tool for analyzing the pattern in DNA modification from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Epigenetic marks can change due to metabolic status, dietary intake or PA [17]. In this work, we studied these variations in DNAm in prepubertal population with obesity that was metabolically healthy. After 12 months of intervention, our population showed an improvement in insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia compared to baseline conditions, components that play a fundamental role in the development of the obesity-related cardiometabolic risk factors [18]. This improvement in clinical parameters was produced as a result of a decrease in intake of different nutrients and total fat and an increase in moderate-vigorous PA. Both lean mass and total mass decreased after 12 months of intervention in the entire population.  Epigenetic marks are used in studies as predictors of the response to weight loss programs.",11eb4151-b528-4526-8a43-bceaa944239d
19,discussion1," As in our intervention, the DNA has different methylation patterns at the beginning of the study in comparison to the end of follow-up, data supported by Moleres et al. [19]. Some studies have also proposed epigenetics as a predictor of the predisposition towards developing obesity in both childhood and adulthood [16]. Herrera et al. [20] demonstrated the importance of an obesogenic environment. Early environmental influences induce epigenetic variation, which permanently affects metabolism and risk of chronic disease. Evidence suggests that the establishment of the epigenome can be affected by environmental factors during critical developmental periods [21]. There are potential interactions between lifestyle and epigenetic mechanisms that mediate the expression of genes associated with increased BMI and adiposity, as is suggested by the effect of diet on the methylation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation such as leptin [22].",e8a30c68-1dcc-46bd-bb97-5c295f73a50c
20,discussion2," On the other hand, dietary intake of methyl groups (choline, methionine, genistein, and folate) during critical periods of developmental alters DNA promoter and histone methylation, thereby resulting in lifelong changes in gene expression and alteration of the epigenome that inclines the individual towards obesity in adulthood [23]. Some cross-sectional studies have reported a significant association between obesity or adiposity status, and DNA methylation [24]. These studies demonstrate that some regions of different genes studied were hypomethylated in obese children and located in the gene body region, and revealed a unique cluster of obese individuals that was differentiated from the normal-weight children [25]. Some of these genes are implicated in lipid and glucose metabolism, differential body size, and body composition in children [26].  The genes studied are involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation. The implication of these genes in the obesity process is still unknown.",2b13e7f2-4e90-4f99-ab05-ba5738461d0c
21,discussion3," In this context, we observed that the methylation pattern is modified after different periods of follow-up (4 and 12 months) with lifestyle modification (MedDiet and PA) which, according to other studies, showed the relationship between obesity and epigenetic marks. In our study, BMI, an indicator of body adiposity, influenced DNAm. After 12 months of intervention, we verified that the DNAm is located in genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways, results in concordance with Wahl et al. [27]. As far as is known, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mediates the used of blood triglycerides. It is a hydrolytic enzyme located in the capillary endothelium that catalyzes the cleavage of triglycerides into fatty acids. Therefore, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity is critical for plasma triglyceride (TG) clearance and tissue uptake of fatty acids [28].",6d39ed5a-019e-45c1-973c-5a5fc60330f5
22,discussion4," We found a significant correlation between the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) DNAm levels and adherence to the MedDiet, moderate and vigorous PA, BMI, WC, and abdominal visceral fat at all points of follow-up, in line with previous results [29, 30]. lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is expressed in different tissues, including adipose tissue and foam cells, and its expression is regulated by liver X receptor (LXR)/RXR heterodimers. lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity is closely linked with RXR [31]. RXRa is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone superfamily of nuclear receptors that function as transcription factors binding to promoter regions of genes. These receptors exert their action by binding, as homodimers or as heterodimers, to specific sequences in the promoters of the target genes and the regulation of their transcription.",03659c77-839a-4f30-a16f-512575600833
23,discussion5," In our population, we found DNAm of RXRa had a significant correlation with energy, fat, saturated fatty acid (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) intake, moderate and vigorous PA, and adherence to the MedDiet at baseline. During the follow-up, the DNAm of RXRa showed a significant correlation with HDL-c levels and fat mass at the end of intervention [32]. It is known that RXR heterodimerizes with subfamily 1 nuclear receptors, including liver X receptor (LXR) [33]. liver X receptor (LXR)s are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate cholesterol and lipid metabolism. Their regulation of gene expression in response to changes in intracellular cholesterol levels link lipid metabolism, inflammation, and immune cell function [34].  liver X receptor (LXR) can be activated by increased intracellular cholesterol concentrations [35].",b43b95b7-340e-41e0-8c66-0a6029b2658f
24,discussion6," According to these data, in our Metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) prepubertal population, the DNAm of liver X receptor (LXR) significantly correlated with weight, BMI, WC, cholesterol and fiber intake, and body composition during the intervention’s follow-up. In addition, we found a significant correlation with the DNAm of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD). stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) is a key enzyme in the conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s) to monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)s), and it has been shown to be overexpressed in adipose tissue in obesity. The DNAm of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) correlated in our population with energy, total fat, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and cholesterol and vitamin D intake at baseline, in accordance with other data [29].",d8ab2024-2bc8-495e-8f8e-7f1d984d37f7
25,discussion7," Recent studies suggest that decreased functional stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) promotes lipid oxidation over storage, decreased lipogenesis, increased beta-oxidation, and increased glucose utilization [36]. In this sense, during the follow-up on our participants, the DNAm of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) correlated with glycemic metabolism parameters (glucose, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR) [37] and adherence to the MedDiet.  Within lipid metabolism, SRE sites are fundamental in the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene expression by sterols. On the other hand, sterols contribute to the control of triglyceride metabolism via binding of SREBF1 to the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) regulatory sequences [38]. SREBPs are loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors that regulate the synthesis and cellular uptake of cholesterol and fatty acids [39].",7bd5cd21-8bb6-4abf-a3ec-c91d25636451
26,discussion8," According to the relation of this gene to fat metabolism, we found correlations with the DNAm of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD), and RXRa. In addition, DNAm of SREBF1 significantly correlates with PA and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) intake.  Finally, leptin is a hormone secreted by adipocytes whose function is to inhibit intake and stimulate energy expenditure, thus allowing for body weight maintenance. Leptin resistance is related to diet-induced obesity (high-fat diets), which is the main cause of obesity in humans. The decrease in leptin sensitivity leads to deregulation of satiety, which increases intake and affects nutrient absorption, metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and energy balance [40]. In our population, DNAm of leptin correlated with sedentarism and HDL-c levels at baseline. It is known that leptin can regulate cholesterol-ester metabolism and the atherosclerotic process associated with obesity [41].",ac3718c1-8cd2-4d49-bb46-be32da6f1492
27,discussion9," A significant association has also been found between the DNAm of leptin and insulin and LDL-c levels as well as vigorous PA at the end of follow-up. In accordance with these data, some studies about dietary intervention identify DNAm as biomarkers of a weight loss response [42]. These genomic loci are located in proximity to obesity-associated genes such as LEP. These epigenetic signatures may potentially be used in precision medicine as baseline biomarkers to predict the effectiveness of a weight loss intervention [5].  Limitations The limitations of this study include the low weight loss and lack of big changes in the BMI of our participants. However, the period of follow-up of the lifestyle modification of our prepubertal population, which took place over a year, is a strength of this study, since it provides an evaluation of the impact of nutrition and PA over the epigenetic modifications of different genes involved in the inflammation process and lipid metabolism.",c0ba9b04-3146-4167-ba9b-864e6ec5491e
28,discussion10," In addition, MedDiet adherence questionnaire used in this study is validated for Mediterranean populations, but not specifically for a prepubertal population. Another limitation is that there was no randomization or control group (normal-weight subjects) to safely attribute changes, though the results and the longitudinal design are strengths.  Conclusion This study shows the results of the DNAm of specific genes related to lipid metabolism and inflammation in metabolically healthy obesity and in a prepubertal population. The DNAm of the genes studied are closely related to different anthropometric and analytical parameters, components of food intake, type of PA, and body composition as well as between those genes. In addition, these results also suggest that the influence of methylation profile is present even in childhood and that this methylation profile can be modified by interventions based on MedDiet and PA.",94a955fe-6108-4596-ad77-dfc34cbfae6f
29,discussion11,"  In terms of public health, a healthy lifestyle in the entire population from childhood to old age is essential so that the epigenetic modifications that occur in human DNA do not lead to the development of different molecular process and pathologies associated with obesity, such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, inflammatory processes, hypertension, alterations of the vascular structure, and cardiovascular diseases.  Material and methods Study population In this study, a prepubescent population aged 4–9 years, of both sexes, was included.

Next, blood samples were taken to analyze analytical parameters (triglyceride levels, HDL-c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (%), creatinine, uric acid, microalbuminuria, insulin, HOMA-IR, and glucose after 12 h of fasting) to confirm that they met the inclusion criteria as well as to determine baseline levels before the intervention. The samples were tested in the Clinical Analysis Laboratory of the Regional Hospital of Malaga. Lastly, lifestyle questionnaires (nutritional questionnaires on the frequency of food consumption, a PA questionnaire, and questionnaires on adherence to the Mediterranean diet) were completed.",87ec0aa2-e29b-4438-995a-bc6c449a4347
32,discussion14,"  Once the parents/guardians granted permission for the inclusion of their child in the study and it was verified that the child met the inclusion criteria, they had an interview with a nutritionist at the beginning of the study. The nutritionist informed the parents/guardians and the children about the characteristics and recommendations of the Mediterranean diet and the healthy lifestyle they should follow during the study period. The participants and their parents/guardians participated in an interview with the nutritionist in which they completed lifestyle questionnaires (nutritional questionnaires about the frequency of food consumption, PA questionnaires, and questionnaires about adherence to the Mediterranean diet) in order to know their lifestyle prior to the intervention.",7347b50c-afb8-4bf4-872b-ace40b52e6c3
33,discussion15," Dietary records completed for three non-consecutive days and a food frequency questionnaire for the previous year (number of times/day, number of days/week, number of days/14 days, number of days/month, rarely, or never) were completed at the baseline visit and 4 and 12 months after the intervention [45] (https://www.healthychildren.org/Spanish/healthy-living/nutrition/Paginas/Energy-In-Recommended-Food-Drink-Amounts-for-Children.aspx). A food frequency questionnaire divided into nine sections showing food groups was used. These sections are diary, eggs, meat and fish, fruits, vegetables, legumes and cereals, oils and fats, pastries, miscellaneous, and beverages. The FFQ includes 9 possible responses for frequency of consumption ranging from never/rarely to > 6 servings/day. In addition, a self-reported record of food questionnaire was used for three consecutive days, 2 days of daily, and another day of the weekend.",3d2c46cf-15c8-4264-ad40-d7f8d891ee3c
34,discussion16,"  The Mediterranean diet recommended to the study subjects included extra virgin olive oil and nuts. The recommended calorie intake was 1500 kcal/day (https://www.healthychildren.org/Spanish/healthy-living/nutrition/Paginas/Energy-In-Recommended-Food-Drink-Amounts-for-Children.aspx) with the following macronutrient distribution [46]: 30% fats (5–8% saturated fatty acids, 15–18% monounsaturated fatty acids, 5–8% polyunsaturated fatty acids, and less than 300 mg of cholesterol per day), 50% carbohydrates (less than 10% simple sugars, 40% complex sugars, and low glycemic index), and 20% protein. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was determined according to the instructions of Trichopoulou et al. [47].  They were also informed that they should perform regular PA with two trained supervisors with a degree in the physical activity and sports sciences field. International PA guidelines recommend that children exercise daily (http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/chapterthree).",413bc9bc-1a6b-4f7f-9eac-7eab498b92ab
35,discussion17," To do so, participants were given access to sports programs. We offered the possibility of attending an exercise program daily from Monday to Friday (5 sessions/week for 120 min/session). Participants were required to attend a minimum of 3 sessions per week. Attendance was recorded at the beginning of each PA session. The sessions consisted of aerobic exercises, resistance training, and exercises to improve flexibility and balance. Sessions were held for the duration of the study. In addition, participants kept a PA record using a GENEActiv Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer to measure energy expenditure. It was used for one full week at the baseline visit and again at 4 and 12 months.  In addition, parents/guardians were provided with the telephone number of those in charge of the study so that they could ask questions about nutrition and PA that may have arisen before the next visit.",80287bac-65fb-4bc5-8228-a7c7c48f4d07
36,discussion18,"  All patients participating in the study gave their informed consent, and protocols were approved by the institutional ethics committee (Comité de Ética de la Investigación Provincial de Málaga, belonging to the Andalusian Health Service).  Epigenetic study For methylation analysis, PBMCs were used to extract genomic DNA using TRIzol™ Reagent. The epigenetic profiling of genomic DNA was analyzed in 131 Metabolically healthy obesity (MHO)Ch using the methylation assays (Qiagen). Bisulfite conversion of DNA samples was performed using the EZ DNAm kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA) on 500 ng of DNA. A PCR of methylated DNA was carried out to amplify the genes of interest using PyroMark PCR Kit (Qiagen) and Primers PyroMark CpG Assays (Qiagen). Pyrosequencing was carried out using PyroMark Gold Q96 and primers PyroMark CpG Assay (Qiagen).",dde7f5fb-ac88-422d-aa8d-f0de81fb97f7
37,discussion19," The proportion of methylation (%) for each subject at each CpG site was computed by first subtracting the background signal intensity of negative controls from both the methylated and unmethylated signals then dividing the ratio of the methylated signal intensity by the sum of both methylated and unmethylated signals.  Table 7 shows 6 amplicons for the validated CpGs. These gene candidates are lipoprotein lipase (lipoprotein lipase (LPL)), retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRa), liver X receptor (liver X receptor (LXR)), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD)), sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBF1), and leptin (LEP).
