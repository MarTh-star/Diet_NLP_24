0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design and Ethics The study was approved by the Ethic Committee of the Research Unit of Polytechnic Institute of Santarém (Document 022019Agrária), and complies with European Regulation on Data Protection [24]. The study was designed to assess MD adherence with the previously validated 14-point Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) [22,23], as well as factors of lifestyle and subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB). A structured questionnaire was constructed in Google Forms for collection of data. Enrollment in the study was performed by the dissemination of the questionnaire through institutional mailing lists, social media and personal contacts of the researchers involved in the study, mostly in the region of Lisbon and Alentejo. Eligible participants to fill the questionnaire were adults (age ≥ 18 years). No gender, educational, health, social, and cultural selection were intended at this phase.",30e13b43-6725-4764-ae34-1a25e61d6386
1,methods1," The questionnaire was confidential and was filled anonymously online. Collection of anonymous data occurred from May to December 2019. A total of 505 participants completed the questionnaire. Before analysis, fifteen responses were excluded from the analysis due to no consent of data utilization (5), and age below 18 years (1). Two other exclusion criteria were applied before data analysis: nationality different from Portuguese living in Portugal, or Portuguese living abroad (9). Thus, data from 490 Portuguese adults (age ≥ 18 years), living in Portugal were eligible for analysis.  2.2. Data Collection The questionnaire was developed under the frame of an international project involving a consortium of seven countries [22]. The design of the questionnaire was done according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (operation and Development (OECD)) recommendations [11], and consisted of 57 questions (Supplementary Materials S1).",d4c2c816-37a6-4dbe-b3b4-fd12e12a5969
2,methods2," The questionnaire began with an introductory explanation of the study and the nature of the participation, with a question at the end asking for authorization to use the data anonymously for statistical analysis and scientific publication. After consenting to fill the questionnaire, the participant proceeded to the following sections of the questionnaire, which included questions on sociodemographic data, subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB), health status, lifestyle, and food habits. The present work is a sub-study of the complete questionnaire. In this sub-study the following data were used for analysis (questions 2.1 to 2.13; 2.20; 2.23 to 2.30; 2.33; 2.36; 3.1 to 3.",2e9e1dc8-34e5-461e-bc28-de91c3b5af2b

4,methods4," and frequency of contact with family and friends (never or occasionally, sometimes, frequently or almost all the time); (iv) subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) data included the five core questions recommended from the operation and Development (OECD) [11], assessed with a 10 point Likert-type scale, where 0 = not at all to 10 = completely/all the time): one question about life global evaluation (overall, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?); three affect questions (how happy did you feel during the last week?; how worried did you feel during the last week?; did you feel depressed during the last week?); one eudemonic question (to what extent do you feel that the things you do in life are worthwhile?); (v) the 14 food frequency questions used to calculate the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) [22], and one question on the number of meals per day.  2.3.",fa0c703b-b37f-4f7a-b7aa-2be8b64c8b74
5,methods5," Data Analysis Statistical analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)) 26 statistical package for Windows (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The presence of nominal, ordinal and scale variables, as well as testing scale variables for normality and heteroscedasticity, by Kolmorogov–Smirnoff and Levene tests, rendered the use of non-parametric analysis as the best choice [25]. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, BMI, MD and subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) data are represented as % for ordinal or nominal variables, and as median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)) for scale variables. To facilitate comparison with other studies, we also present mean and SD for scale variables.",571cb3dc-7c04-4509-8545-8ecec0552d84
6,methods6," Mann–Whitney U tests for ordinal and scale variables, or chi-square tests for nominal variables were used to assess differences between genders (significant for p-values < 0.05) [25].  Non-parametric partial correlations of all sociodemographic, BMI, lifestyle, and subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) variables with the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) were performed. This type of correlation allowed to control all the identified potential confounders (sex, age, years of residence in Portugal, education, marital status, employment status, net income, smoking, time spent in nature, meals per day, satisfaction with life as a whole, feeling that things do in life are worthwhile, feelings of happiness, worry and depression). These confounders were identified by the observance of significant bivariate correlations with 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score and, if uncontrolled could bias the results.",0b91181f-1f44-4773-9311-f1e247964554
7,methods7," Additionally, it was considered that when conducting multiple analyses on the same dependent variable (14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score), there is an increased chance of committing a type I error. A type I error implies a higher chance for a false positive, or in other words, rejecting the null hypothesis when it should not. For this reason, the p-value was adjusted by Bonferroni’s Correction, which is one of several methods used to counteract the problem of multiple comparisons [26]. Data are represented as Spearman’s partial correlation values/p-values (significant for p-values < 0.0025).  To analyse association of 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) with subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB), the five core subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) items were used to group subjects into profiles.",2907b264-6323-4443-85d8-ce9ff8e37784
8,methods8," Two-Step Clustering analysis is an exploratory tool designed to reveal natural groupings within a dataset that would otherwise not be apparent. Hence, this analysis was performed applying a Log-likelihood distance measure and the Schwarz’s Bayesian clustering criterion, for which each solution is compared against each other [25,27], and was used to determine the best number of groups. This methodology leaded to the creation of three profiles: one including the subjects with high subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) (profile 1), another one with subjects exhibiting intermediate subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) (profile 2) and profile 3 including the subjects with the low subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB).",2d8b0ea6-b8e5-489f-81a9-be8923762258
9,methods9," Then for each profile, global 5-item subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) indexes were determined by calculating the average of the five subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) parameters (an inverted scale, 10- “x”, was applied to two variables: feeling of worry and feeling of being depressed). The validity of the clusters and 5-item subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) indexes for each profile were verified by Mann–Whitney U tests (significant differences for p-value < 0.05). The subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) parameters of each profile are represented as mean ± SD. The profiles created according to subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) indexes were compared with 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) by Mann–Whitney U tests. Differences were considered significant when p-value < 0.05.",b40c5399-d652-45dd-bcf0-4081de3248aa
10,methods10," Classes of adherence to MD were defined as low adherence (14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) ≤ 5), moderate adherence (14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) between 6 and 9), and high adherence (14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) ≥ 10) [28].  3. Results 3.1. Sociodemographic Characteristics of the Participants The main sociodemographic characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1. From the 490 individuals that entered this study that were of Portuguese nationality and living in Portugal, more than 50% had been living in Portugal for more than 20 years, were women, and were young people of ages up to 34 years old (Table 1). Most participants were single or engaged in a stable relationship (Table 1), and the median household size was of three (interquartile range (IQR) 2) persons (data not shown in Table 1). Significant differences in the distribution between men and women were observed for education level (p-value = 0.",3711be43-9e6f-4eb4-9123-48d31ce57f91
11,methods11,"025), employment status (p = 0.003), and net income (p-value = 0.024). Secondary level predominated in men, while university level predominated in women (Table 1). Although most of the participants were employed (70%), a higher percentage of students were men, while a higher percentage of unemployed participants was observed in women (Table 1). The monthly net income was referenced to Portuguese Social Support Index (Portuguese Social Support Index (PSSI)) in 2020 (438.81 Euros) and half of the respondents had incomes higher or equal to four times the Portuguese Social Support Index (PSSI) value, with men reporting higher income values (Table 1).  3.2. MD Adherence, Lifestyle Habits and Nutritional Status Adherence to MD and other lifestyle habits are presented in Table 2. The median adherence to MD was assessed by 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), presenting a median score of 7 (interquartile range (IQR) 3) and a mean of 7.4 (SD 2.1) (Table 2).",9d207ccd-8f6c-450d-80de-8fa2088e9d83
12,methods12," A significant difference in the distribution of men and women among the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) categories was observed, with women showing a higher adherence to MD (p value < 0.001, Table 2). Using the criteria defined in the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) trial [28], a low percentage of the study population (17.1%) could be classified as having a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet, with most of the participants falling within a moderate adherence (62.7%), and 20.2% having a low adherence. A significant difference was also observed in the number of meals per day, with a higher percentage of women reporting four or five meals per day, compared to a higher percentage of men reporting eating three or four meals per day (p-value < 0.001). Regarding other lifestyle factors, about 80% of the respondents were non-smokers, and slept 6 to 8 h per night; most of the participants did not practice physical activity regularly (Table 2).",023e0dec-9224-4474-a5dc-9b5046a77b9c
13,methods13," Significant differences in the distribution between men and women were observed for smoking (26.6% men, 15.8% women, p-value = 0.005).  Most participants reported not having a diagnosed pathology, and had a BMI classified as normal weight (Table 3). Men exhibited significantly higher BMI values than women (p-value < 0.001), with median values of 24.3 and 22.6 kg/m2, respectively (Table 3). Overweight was more prevalent among men, but obesity was higher among women (Table 3).  3.3. Subjective Well-Being Regarding subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB), a median value of 7 was obtained for the five-item subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) index, and no significant differences in the distribution were observed between men and women (Table 4). Globally, the highest score was observed for the eudemonic question (feeling that life is worthwhile), followed by the satisfaction with life and happiness (Table 4).",eb959ba8-f3f3-4df9-b010-cd925ae4c317
14,methods14," Scores of feeling depressed were the lowest and showed a larger interquartile range (Table 4).  Cluster analysis lead to grouping of participants into three different subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) profiles, ranked by the five-item subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) index: profile one, 8.2 ± 1.3; profile two, 6.2 ± 1.6; profile three, 3.9 ± 1.0 (Table 5). More than half of the participants fitted into profile two, with profile three showing the lower percentage of participants (Table 5).  3.4. Variables Influence on the MD Adherence: Exploring the Relationship between MD and subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) Sociodemographic, BMI, lifestyle and subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) parameters were tested for correlations with 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score (Table 6). Despite the fact that no strong associations were found (ρ values between 0.1 and 0.",711f8739-407d-4dec-bd12-b7dcd63ce007
15,methods15,"3 for all the studies factors), weak significant positive correlations with 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) were observed for sex (p-value = 0.002), employment status (p-value = 0.002), time spent in nature (p-value < 0.001) and number of meals per day (p-value < 0.001) (Table 6).  As shown in Table 6, when the five items of subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) were tested individually for correlations with Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score, no significant correlations were observed for any of the subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) parameters, when considering Bonferroni corrections (p-value < 0.0025). However, as shown in Figure 1, the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score is lower in the profile with the lower five-item subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) index (profile three, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) = 6.5 ± 2.",af0974b2-ab2c-43c2-8d25-c2b8b40ae837
16,methods16,"1) compared with the other two profiles (profile two, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) = 7.3 ± 2.1; profile one, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) = 7.8 ± 1.9; p < 0.001 for profile one and p = 0.022 for profile two) (Figure 1). In the same way Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score in subjects from profile two was significantly lower (p = 0.005) than the one found in profile one subjects (Figure 1).  4. Discussion The scarcity of data on the adherence to the MD of Portuguese adults, as well as on the assessment of subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) enhances the relevance of this study. MD adherence of Portuguese adults was assessed with 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), in a sample of 490 individuals, showing a mean 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score of 7.4 ± 2.1.",06deedb5-b87d-4a2e-8656-fcbd5793c782
17,methods17," Two other studies on Portuguese convenience population samples in the same region as this study reported similar Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores: 7.3 ± 2.2, with participants mostly from primary care centers and a Medical School (n = 224) [30], and 6.8 ± 2.3 with participants from a Portuguese university (n = 305) [31]. With regard to adherence to the MD, the results from this study show a low percentage (17.1%) classified as high adherence to the MD (14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score of 10), still slightly higher than another study undertaken with 5653 Portuguese adults covering all the territories of Portugal, where 12% of the participants scored a 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) value of 10 and 88% had a 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score below 10 [32]. Most of the participants in the present study could be classified in the range of moderate MD adherence (62.",eb60d17d-53ee-4b3c-b295-618803caf70d
18,methods18,"7% with 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores between six and nine). Results from this study highlight significant differences in MD between genders, where women scored higher 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) values than men (6.6 ± 2.2 for men and 7.7 ± 2.0 for women, p-values < 0.001). Gender differences with regard to healthy dietary patterns have been observed in other Portuguese studies. A representative national study showed that women are more likely to adopt a healthier dietary pattern, characterized by high intake of fruit and vegetables and a low intake of meat, while men tend to adopt a dietary pattern with high consumption of meat and low intake of fruits and vegetables [17]. Regarding adherence to MD, in a study with university students, women had a statistically significant higher 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score than men [31].",6c3d12d1-32ab-4635-84ca-fad4614f8c7f
19,methods19,"  In other European Mediterranean countries, the adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern assessed by 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) varies. For instance, in Spain, the PREDIMED study [28], which enrolled 7447 asymptomatic participants at high risk for coronary heart disease aged 55–80 years old, showed a Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score of 8.6 ± 2.0, and in a sample of Spanish university students (n = 310) the mean 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score was 7.0 ± 2.0 [33]. On the other hand, in Greece a non-probability sample of 236 students, aged 19–30 years old showed a mean 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score of 6.4 ± 1.9 [34], with the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores for women being statistically significant higher compared to their male counterparts.",b90cba6c-431b-4d4a-a4c1-20d1bf447b6e
20,methods20," Outside the Mediterranean region, the mean 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores tend to be lower than in Mediterranean countries both in European and in non-European countries. For instance, in the United Kingdom, in a study performed in Bristol in 96 adults with a high cardiovascular risk, the mean 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score was 5.5 ± 2.1 [35], and in South Korea, in a study run at a health check-up centre with 211 participants, the 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score was found to be 6.2 ± 2.2 [36]. Naturally, being located further from the Mediterranean region, the cultural background, food habits and foods availability lowers the chances of higher adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern.",7b76ff48-47f4-41c1-8bcb-b5d6b9af6544
21,methods21," Nevertheless, since the MD has consistently shown to promote health, both in observational studies and randomized trials [5], its assessment in different countries and in different population samples is of the utmost importance.  After adjustment for sociodemographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, this study showed a significant correlation (p-value < 0.002) of MD adherence with employment status and gender, with employed individuals and women showing higher levels of adherence than unemployed individuals and men. However, it is important to point that these were weak correlations (correlation coefficients between 0.1 and 0.2). Although Bonferroni correction did not render net income as statistically significant (p-value > 0.003), there was a tendency of higher incomes being associated with higher 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores than lower incomes. Nevertheless, a careful interpretation of the results is needed, since 17.",4be00305-1f9e-4a9f-9ab0-e045df90daca
22,methods22,"5% of the participants did not report the net income, which might be associated with lower levels of income. Other studies have reported healthier dietary patterns or higher adherence to MD in women and individuals with higher income [17,37,38,39]. Most of these studies also found a positive association of MD adherence to other sociodemographic factors such as older age and being married or living as a couple [18,38,40], and other socioeconomic factors such as a higher education level [37,40]. However, no general rule can be drawn; some studies have found no association of MD adherence with age and gender [40], and one study has observed different results for different instruments measuring MD adherence in the same population [37], suggesting that associations between healthy eating and gender or age depend on the assessment instrument. The same may also be true for lifestyle factors.",3c52daf0-3043-4990-a84f-8b6baf0d5076
23,methods23," No statistically significant correlates were found in this study between the adherence to the MD assessed by Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and physical activity, or smoking, despite other studies reporting a positive association between the adherence to the MD, assessed by methods other than 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), with physical activity [40,41], and an inverse association with smoking, and sedentary behaviours [37]. In this study, a lifestyle behaviour that showed a weak significant correlation with MD adherence was the number of meals (p-value < 0.001). This is partially in line with another Portuguese study that observed a higher number of meals in participants following a diet rich in fruit and vegetables [18]. The present study also showed, for the first time, that a higher frequency of contact with nature may be related to a higher adherence to the MD (p-value < 0.001).",3c7e959a-0101-4866-8801-83c35133294c
24,methods24," The latter should be cross evidenced further with larger samples that include not only urban populations but also participants from the countryside, where stress levels and skewed demography could present different correlations. In fact, it has been shown that the relationship between sociodemographic and economic factors, and dietary intake patterns differ in rural versus urban areas [42].  Although no causal relationship has yet been demonstrated, several studies have been accumulating evidence on the positive association between healthy food habits, particularly consumption of vegetables and fruits, and quality of life, happiness, and feelings of depression, [43,44]. Thus, it was expected that MD would have the same beneficial association. In fact, some studies have shown a positive association between MD and quality of life in healthy adults [5,45], and an inverse association with depression risk, with significant dose–response relationships [17,46].",3f3ecfb2-5c5d-478e-beba-6ad463e2a34a
25,methods25," On the other hand, enhanced subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) has been linked to a better health status, and healthy behaviors [47,48]. Most of the performed studies were observational and focused on the hedonic dimension of well-being, showing that higher levels of life satisfaction and positive affect were correlated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer [49]. Other studies have also looked for associations between the hedonic sub-dimension and diet. For example, in the SUN study, the authors assessed quality of life with the Spanish version of the quality of life questionnaire (QoL), which includes questions on depression and happiness in the emotional well-being dimension. The highest significant correlation for emotional well-being was fruit consumption [45], which is a type of food highly consumed in MD.",84b8c4a5-6795-4ad5-9ef7-c5f9cd6463d9
26,methods26," Furthermore, a study with people above 60 years showed a direct relationship between the adherence to the MD and life satisfaction of women but not for men [50]. Some recent research has shown that the eudemonic dimension is also associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases and higher incidence of healthy behaviours, such as physical activity and fruit and vegetables intake [51,52].  To our knowledge, this is the first study where a higher adherence to MD was observed in adult participants with higher subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB), as a concept including both eudemonic and hedonic well-being. It has been suggested that both hedonic and eudemonic constructs should be included to best capture associations of psychological well-being and longevity [49], and this study applied this concept to study associations between subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) and MD.",6bd51ad9-c3be-45c5-86d4-b0f52efd2856
27,methods27," Eudemonic subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) assessed the extent that the individual considered that life was meaningful and worthwhile. Hedonic subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) assessed overall life satisfaction, and feelings of happiness, depression, and worry. No significant differences in the distributions between men and women in any of the five subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) components were observed, in line with results reported by the statistical office of the European Union (European Union (EUROSTAT)), regarding overall life satisfaction [53]. The five components were combined to create three subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) profiles, with the average of the five components defining a five-item subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) index (8.2 ± 1.3, 6.2 ± 1.0, 3.9 ± 1.0 for profiles one, two, and three, respectively).",c43ace6d-33cd-4528-ba16-8b369104b931
28,methods28," Classifying the five-item subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) index, according to the European Union (EUROSTAT) classification of overall life satisfaction (0 to 5, low; 6 to 8, medium, 9–10, high) [53], profile one would be classified as medium to high subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB), profile two as medium subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB), and profile three as low subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB). Although all profiles could be classified as moderate adherence to MD (14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score between six and nine), the present study has shown that MD adherence significantly increases (p-value < 0.01) from low subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) (profile three, mean 14-Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score of 6.5) to medium/high subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) (profile one, mean Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score of 7.",ca1e12c3-3bc6-46e4-8b8e-ca2d99b81486
29,methods29,"8).  It is interesting to note that the mean of overall life satisfaction (hedonic sub-dimension) of profiles one (8.4 ± 1.0), and two (7.2 ± 1.0) is higher than the reported mean values for the Portuguese population in 2018 (6.7 [53]), and the mean value observed in profile three is much lower (4.7 ± 1.6). The same is true for the eudemonic sub-dimension, with a mean value of 8.9 ± 0.9, 7.7 ± 1.0, and 5.1 ± 1.7, for profiles one, two, and three, respectively, compared to the average value reported in 2013 for the Portuguese population (7.5 [53]).  Some limitations should be considered when interpreting the results: the analysis was conducted on a relatively low number of individuals, and the study design only allowed to define associations, not causal relations. Additionally, the use of self-filled frequency questionnaires to assess dietary patterns, may introduce an overestimation of foods considered healthy and underestimation of foods considered non-healthy.",c0a777a0-ea3e-44f2-ac42-50ba50f005e8
30,methods30," Furthermore, the interpretation of frequencies such as occasionally, sometimes, and frequently, may be different among participants, when assessing frequency of contact with nature, or family and friends. It must also be noted that 17.5% of the respondents did not answer the question on net income, which may have conditioned the analysis of correlation between net income and MD adherence. On the other hand, regarding subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) self-assessment, the fact that individuals are in their natural settings when they complete the questionnaire, may prevent distortion of results due to unusual circumstances.",63f54dba-005c-411e-af4d-9d6afb004127
31,methods31," Another strength of the study is the eligibility of participants being restricted to Portuguese citizens living in Portugal, and excluding citizens from other nationalities living in Portugal, or Portuguese citizens living abroad, which prevents cultural and linguistic factors that may introduce biases in country-level MD adherence and subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB).  5. Conclusions In conclusion, this study shows a moderate adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern in a study sample of 490 Portuguese adults. Although the level of correlation was weak, a higher level of adherence was found to be positively associated with women, employed individuals, a higher number of meals per day, and those with frequent contact with nature.",fc95efb6-12a0-4650-ba8a-798ca1377dcc
32,methods32," As a novelty, this study assessed both hedonic and eudemonic subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB), showing that low subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB), medium subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB), and medium to high subjective assessment of their own well being (SWB) profiles reported significantly increasing Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores.
