0,methods0," 2.1. Study Population  The study population for this work draws from two prospective cohorts in the United States, Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII). Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) is an increased family likelihood of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cohort that enrolled women who already had a child with confirmed autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and followed them through a subsequent pregnancy until their child reached 3 years of age [33]. Eligibility criteria included being less than 29 weeks pregnant, speaking English or Spanish, being 18 or older, and living within two hours of Drexel/Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP); Johns Hopkins University; University of California, Davis; or Northern California Kaiser Permanente. A total of 256 women were enrolled, and children were followed from 2009 to 2012.",761973e9-dfc6-4779-b85d-cec71b59f613
1,methods1," To be included in analyses, information on prenatal diet and child autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related outcomes was required. In addition, we did not include twins (n = 8 pairs) in order to avoid repeat diet information for the same pregnancy. Following these exclusions, 154 participants from Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) were included in the present analyses (Figure S1).  The Nurses’ Health Study II (Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII)) is a large ongoing longitudinal study of 116,429 female registered nurses from the United States aged 25–42 years beginning in 1989 [34]. Biennial questionnaires are mailed to participants to inquire about lifestyle practices, reproductive events, and medical conditions. (All Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) questionnaires are available online: https://nurseshealthstudy.org/participants/questionnaires; accessed on 9 June 2022). The average follow-up rate exceeds 90%.",b8a53a99-9d6e-448b-a968-d531c1a830e3
2,methods2," Participants were eligible for this current study if they had index births between 1991 and 2007, in order to allow for prospective reporting of diet and to include participants from the nested case–control study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that collected the outcome measure used here. The details of this nested case–control study have been previously described [35]. Briefly, in 2005, all cohort participants were asked whether any of their children had autism, Asperger syndrome, or ""other autism spectrum"". In 2007, we enrolled 656 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases and 2800 controls. Controls were randomly selected, and frequency matched at a ratio of 4:1 for years in which case mothers reported births (as, at the time, no information on case year of birth was available). After excluding women without eligible dietary or child information, 10,314 women completed a diet assessment during pregnancy or lactation.",7c271095-52a0-43be-8ba6-c452d1cafc89
3,methods3," Of these, 727 women were part of the nested case–control study and returned an Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) form for their child (Figure S1).  Mothers/caregivers in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) gave written informed consent to study procedures, which were reviewed and approved by local site IRBs. In Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), return of questionnaires constitutes implied consent, and the study protocol of the parent Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  2.2. Dietary Assessment  Dietary information in both studies was collected via comparable food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), both enabling calculation of dietary patterns. Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) used a modified version of the National Cancer Institute’s Dietary History Questionnaire (Dietary History Questionnaire (DHQ)).",ad569837-e9ab-4849-821d-b449ce298438
4,methods4," Modifications were made to assess diet during pregnancy and to capture additional information on toxicant exposures (e.g., added questions about organic intake and canned foods). Dietary information was collected at about the 20th and 36th week of pregnancy, covering diet during weeks 1–20 and 21–36 of gestation, respectively. Approximately 77.5% of participants had dietary information available at both time points, and prior work has indicated strong correlation between reported foods across these times [36]. In Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), the Dietary History Questionnaire (DHQ) from the first timepoint in pregnancy was used in these analyses given the strong correlation across times and that most participants responded to this questionnaire.  In the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), dietary intake was collected in 1991 and every 4 years thereafter, using a previously validated semiquantitative 131-item FFQ [37,38].",9d790b3f-55f0-46af-aab3-9006cc8e20f7
5,methods5," Participants were asked about the frequency of food consumption of a standard portion size of each food on average over the preceding year. An eligible dietary intake measure was defined as returning a valid FFQ one year prior to the birth year of the index child (termed as ""pregnancy group"" hereafter), or 1–2 years after birth of the index child and reported breastfeeding (termed as ""lactation group"" hereafter). In Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), all FFQs returned by participants during 1991–2007 were used to compute dietary patterns. In both studies, total energy intake was calculated by summing energy from all foods. We confirmed that individuals in each study did not have implausible energy intake values.  2.3.",24614cd3-59ca-49ab-b04d-aaa903236026
6,methods6," Dietary Pattern Indices  Dietary patterns, including the empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP)), the Alternative healthy Eating Index (Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010), the Alternate Healthy Eating Index Modified for Pregnancy (Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-P), the Western and Prudent dietary patterns, and the Alternative Mediterranean Diet Score (aMED), were derived in each cohort according to standard approaches [39,40,41,42,43]. Because alcohol intake is associated with maternal and fetal outcomes, alcohol bearing groups were not included in dietary patterns here [44].",d471b182-e8ec-4a64-91b1-80c033678663
7,methods7,"  The empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) was developed using reduced rank regression to summarize the overall inflammatory potential of diet based on intake of food groups shown to predict plasma concentration of three inflammatory markers: interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)), and tumor necrosis factor α receptor 2 (TNFRα2) [28,39]. The Alternative Healthy Eating Index (Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)) is a dietary pattern that characterizes adherence to dietary guidelines [45], and was updated in 2010 (Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010) to include new dietary factors (such as whole grains, sugar sweetened beverages and fruit juice, processed meat and sodium) [43].",c611c3c6-8349-4ad4-82c6-3679bc990896
8,methods8," In addition, we calculated the modified for pregnancy version of the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) (Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-P), which excludes foods not recommended during pregnancy such as alcohol and includes incorporation of folate, iron, and calcium [40]. The Western and Prudent dietary patterns were derived using principal component analysis from dietary information collected by FFQs based on cumulative average consumption of food/beverage groups, following prior work in the NHS cohort [40,41]. The Western pattern was characterized by high consumption of red and processed meat, butter, high-fat dairy products, eggs, and refined grains, while the Prudent patten was characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish and other seafood [41]. The aMED was developed to characterize adherence to a Mediterranean diet, tailored to a U.S. population [42].",c00e0b06-5b97-49b8-8daa-d66141ead5c1
9,methods9," For all dietary patterns, a higher score represents higher adherence to the pattern.  2.4. Outcome Assessment  In both studies, autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related traits were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale (Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)), a widely used and validated measure of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related traits [46,47]. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a 65-item informant report measure (here, completed by mothers) that yields a single quantitative score, with higher scores indicating greater autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related traits and poorer social reciprocity [46,47]. Our analyses used total raw Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores as the primary outcome measure. Sex-normed T-scores, typically used to inform clinical settings, were also used in secondary analyses [46]. For forms with <10% missing, per publisher guidelines, item population median values were substituted for missing values.",59a56726-1a6b-4eb2-9a63-7f4bbd551dc3
10,methods10," In Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), all outcome information, including Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic evaluations, was collected at age 3, and Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), therefore, administered the preschool version of the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). In Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), child age ranged from 4–18, and the school-aged Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) was used as part of a nested case–control study [35]. Scoring procedures and value ranges were the same across these versions of the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS); only minor wording changes differed for age-appropriate examples. Prior work has supported the stability of Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores across age [48].  Information on autism diagnosis was also available in both studies.",09327b40-74ae-4f8e-bbf6-33c9b9b4a263
11,methods11," In Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), autism diagnosis was defined according to clinical assessment and scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)) [32,49,50]. In Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis was defined according to maternal report of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on biennial follow-up questionnaires, as defined in prior work [35]. Maternal report of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in this medically trained population has been validated in a subset of participants administered the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), with results suggesting a high degree of accuracy [35,51].  2.5. Statistical Analysis  Data from both cohorts was analyzed in parallel using a common analytical plan. We used descriptive statistics to examine dietary intake in both cohorts and to determine associations with covariates, overall and by quartiles, of dietary patterns.",3bb4960a-4d2c-4763-b43a-4890e3ac0903
12,methods12," In order to assess associations between maternal dietary patterns and child Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores, we used crude and multivariable adjusted quantile regression. Quantile regression allows for assessment of the relationship between exposure and outcome across quantiles of the outcome and also has the benefit over linear regression of being more robust to non-normally distributed outcomes [52]. Our primary results are shown for associations fixed at the 50th percentile. Dietary patterns were parameterized in quartiles with the lowest quartile as the referent.",ce5cf623-08cf-4f81-84b1-836a037cf512
13,methods13," Covariates considered as potential confounders in adjusted models, based on a priori associations with outcomes and potential or known associations with maternal diet, included maternal age (continuous), child sex (male, female), maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (continuous), household income (Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI): 0–50 k, 50–100 k, 100 k+; Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII):0–40 k, 40–100 k, 100 k+), physical activity (METs/week), child year of birth (in Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) given the larger distribution), maternal race (white, non-white), maternal prenatal smoking (active smoker, non-active smoker), prenatal vitamin use (yes, no), parity (continuous), and total energy intake (continuous). Final fully adjusted models did not include those variables with minimal impact on estimates (<10% change: smoking, race, physical activity, year of birth, and parity).  We also ran a series of secondary and sensitivity analyses.",176394be-e34a-41a1-b1cf-45cf7da3530c
14,methods14," To compare to associations with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis, logistic regression was used to examine the association of each dietary pattern with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis. Primary analyses were also conducted using Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) T-scores rather than raw scores, in order to facilitate clinical interpretation. To examine whether the association between maternal diet and offspring Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) score differed by severity of autism traits, we fit multivariable quantile regression models fixed at other quantiles (10th, 25th, 75th, 90th). Modification by child’s sex was examined for primary associations (dietary patterns and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores) using stratified models.",822fad47-8357-4e36-ac6b-d3fb5fa8e242
15,methods15," In addition, because the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) did not explicitly measure dietary intake during pregnancy, but rather captured intake overlapping across pregnancy and lactation periods, we stratified analyses for this cohort by the derived timing of dietary assessment. Associations were examined separately in these subgroups (pregnancy and lactation). All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4.  3. Results  Sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants overall and by cohort are shown in Table 1. Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) had higher racial and ethnic diversity than Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), though the majority of participants in both cohorts were non-Hispanic White. Fewer participants were in the lowest income category in Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) than in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI).",854779f1-fedc-4ea6-bc31-37f3f400dc80
16,methods16," As expected, because of the familial nature of the cohort, participants in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) had a higher mean Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) raw score (35.8 vs. 28.2) than participants in Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII). Distributions of Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores in both cohorts are shown in Figure S2 and are comparable to prior studies. Characteristics of the two subgroups in Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) were similar (Table S1). Characteristics were also similar across quartiles of Western dietary pattern (as well as the empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP), aMED, and Prudent), though in individuals in the highest quartile of the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010 compared to those in the lowest quartile, maternal age was slightly higher in both cohorts, and BMI lower in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) (Table S2).",7c7d4702-1ba6-43df-bb96-2f7307bd90ac
17,methods17," The distribution of dietary pattern scores was highly comparable across cohorts (Table S3). In both cohorts, total energy intake was positively associated with quartiles of dietary pattern, and this relationship was strongest for the Western dietary pattern (Table S4).  In analyses examining the associations between maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy and child Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), overall, strong associations were not observed (Table 2). Estimates for top quartiles for most dietary patterns, which broadly represent an overall healthier diet for the Prudent, Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), and aMED, and overall less healthy diet or more pro-inflammatory diet for the Western and empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP), respectively, were below the null for all patterns except the Western diet.",cbbce6f9-4653-4e9b-821e-34cc3d456fef
18,methods18," Statistically significant increases in Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores were observed across all quartiles of intake relative to the lowest quartile in the adjusted model not including total energy intake, though estimates were similar across quartiles (no evidence for trend) and additional adjustment for total energy intake attenuated estimates (only Q2 vs. Q1 remained statistically significant (ß = 11.71, 95% CI: 2.16, 22.71). Adjusted estimates for the top quartiles (Q4) of both the Prudent and the aMED dietary patterns were suggestive of an inverse relationship (ß = −14.17, 95% CI: −22.76, 2.11; ß = −12.32, 95% CI: −23.33, 4.05).  In Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), estimates across quartiles of the empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP), Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), Prudent, and Mediterranean dietary patterns were generally null (Table 3).",d904eace-65fb-4f39-a1a7-d757aa95b106
19,methods19," There were slight increases in Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores for Q2 and Q4 of the Western dietary pattern in the adjusted model not including total energy intake, but these increases did not remain statistically significant with adjustment for total energy intake, and, as in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), no trend was suggested. In both Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), adjustment for additional covariates, including physical activity, did not materially alter findings (Tables S5 and S6).  In analyses examining associations with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis, results were generally consistent with those of Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores, suggesting no strong associations with these maternal dietary patterns in both cohorts (Table S7, Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), and Table 4, Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII)).",7f8434b8-3bd2-473b-a9b4-5a99781ef40d
20,methods20," In Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), adjusted ORs were above the null for intake above the median (quartiles collapsed due to small n values) for both the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010 and the aMED, but with wide CIs. In Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), there was a non-significant increased odds of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with higher empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) (Q4 vs. Q1 AOR = 1.41, 95% CI 0.76, 2.62), and mainly null estimates for other dietary patterns.  Across additional secondary analyses, results were broadly consistent with primary findings. Findings were consistent with primary analyses when using T-scores (Table S8).",49788a5a-2091-4ef8-9014-9586d58689ad
21,methods21," In both Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), while there were some suggestions of higher estimates with increasing quantile of Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) across percentiles in quantile regression (Tables S9 and S10, Figures S3 and S4), confidence intervals were increasingly wide in these analyses. We did not observe evidence for effect modification by child’s sex (Table S11), and precision was low in these stratified models, especially in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI). Estimates were consistently further from the null in males than in females in both cohorts, though confidence intervals were wide.",77d1b050-ee99-4bdf-8c9a-237391f04fe2
22,methods22," Examining associations in Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) timing of diet subgroups, estimates were somewhat stronger in the pregnancy subgroup of the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) than in the lactation subgroup (Table S12), with increases in Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores for Q2 and Q4 of the Western dietary pattern in particular, but confidence intervals crossed the null.  4. Discussion  In this study drawing from two prospective longitudinal cohorts of more than 800 pregnant women in the United States, we did not find strong evidence that maternal dietary patterns were associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related traits or diagnosis. This is the first study to examine relationships between a series of established dietary patterns in and surrounding pregnancy and child autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related outcomes.",0f9f172b-b5bb-4304-96b3-8f3036bc97d0
23,methods23," Our cross-cohort comparative design also enabled consideration of the role of background familial likelihood of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in these relationships. While strong associations were not identified in either population, there were some suggestions of associations in the familial cohort that were not evident in the general population cohort. Given the known importance of prenatal and early life nutrition to child health and development, continued work should address how these dietary patterns and other dietary factors may influence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related outcomes in other ways than assessed here.  Few prior studies have addressed the role of prenatal dietary patterns and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related outcomes.",9559a8b4-4dbe-4193-8dd4-adb23f2d672c
24,methods24," A 2018 case–control study in China, including 708 participants, 354 of whom had a confirmed autism diagnosis, examined maternal dietary patterns during and prior to pregnancy in relationship to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) case status [14]. This study did not utilize established dietary patterns as addressed here, but found that, compared to a diet balanced in meat and vegetable intake, “unbalanced” diets high in either meat or vegetables were associated with increased odds of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Both the empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) and Western dietary patterns have meat as a key component, and thus our suggestions of some signals with these patterns could be consistent with their findings [14].",49f3f6c0-12fa-45a9-9623-c527fc8163ee
25,methods25," In another study including 325 mother–child pairs enrolled in the US-based Newborn Epigenetics STudy (Newborn Epigenetics STudy (NEST)), high maternal periconceptional adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with lower odds of autistic behavior as measured by composite scores from the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment [30]. While we did not observe significant associations with the Mediterranean diet here, estimates for the top quartile of the aMED, as well as the Prudent diet (which shares some similarity to a Mediterranean-style diet) in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) (but not Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII)) were suggestive of an inverse relationship. These findings are of additional interest given evidence that low adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern has been associated with increased methylation in a sex-specific manner [29], and given links between methylation, folic acid, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [53,54].",f00a3b5b-7588-4e48-be1b-8d9f86667e32
26,methods26," The potentially stronger effects in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) as compared to Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) for these patterns could suggest possible interactions or differences based on background risk. Finally, a small case–control study in China including 295 participants, 108 of whom had autism spectrum disorder (ASD), found that diets high in fruit and those high in fish were associated with lower odds of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [31]. In comparison, we saw null associations between the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)P dietary patterns and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related traits, all of which include fruit and fish as essential components and may characterize a diet high in fruit or fish.",e2560521-ae2c-4b02-b730-ce2de53a78f3
27,methods27," However, prior work in the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) study has identified an association between fish intake and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores that differed by timing and type of fish [9]. Thus, both similarities and discrepancies across these few studies exist. Differences may be related to assessment and characterization of dietary intake, as well as to time periods for which diet represents.  In our study, we observed some suggestions of a link between unhealthy diet according to the Western diet and increases in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related outcomes. This relationship was stronger in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), and when not adjusting for total energy intake.",a90371ec-4ef8-4b1e-8407-66970d951448
28,methods28," The Western dietary pattern had the strongest correlation with total energy intake, and variability in total energy intake was also highest in the highest quartile of dietary patterns, which may have contributed to the less precise estimates in these energy-adjusted models. It is also possible that total consumption may be a causal intermediate of the relationship between diet and neurodevelopment, or may have joint effects with other covariates, such as BMI or income. We did not have sufficient sample size in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), where Western pattern associations were primarily seen, to adequately address potential interactions. Prior work has suggested a positive relationship between maternal obesity and gestational weight gain and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and thus weight, increased caloric intake, and unhealthy intake may together influence these outcomes.",44c3fb0c-d8b7-4d07-ac89-178b616d7e0f
29,methods29," There was also a non-significant elevation in odds of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis with higher empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) in the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII). Both the empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) and the Western dietary patterns include pro-inflammatory food groups such as processed and red meat, and high adherence to both dietary patterns is consistent with a pro-inflammatory diet [39,41]. Pro-inflammatory diets have been shown to be associated with a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [55], and accumulating evidence suggests prenatal immune disruption in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including microglial (immune cells in the brain involved in neural circuitry development) dysfunction, inflammation in postmortem brain studies and studies of prenatal cytokine levels, and increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) following maternal immune-mediated conditions during pregnancy [56,57,58].",f60121dc-c30b-4b4a-861f-e102978237c4
30,methods30," Further work addressing potential links with pro-inflammatory dietary factors, therefore, seems warranted.  There are several potential explanations for the lack of strong associations in our work. One may be due to these being relatively healthy cohorts. There was a relatively high degree of supplement use in these cohorts. It is possible that in less healthy, more nutrient-deficient populations, the association between dietary intake and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related outcomes may be stronger. It is also possible that associations with prenatal diet are tied to more specific phenotypic aspects or subgroups than examined here. Some prior work examining maternal dietary factors, for example, has suggested stronger associations between maternal polyunsaturated fatty acid levels and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with co-occurring intellectual disability [10,11].",79d2458d-99c7-40bd-b38a-5dc33f842859
31,methods31," Diet may also interact with other environmental exposures [59], and thus null independent effects do not necessarily imply lack of overall importance, particularly considering evidence for joint effects in key pathways [29].  Our study has several strengths, including the ability to examine multiple established dietary patterns in association with both autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related traits and diagnosis in both an increased familial likelihood (Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI)) and general population cohort (Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII)). Additional strengths include clinical assessments in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), the use of established FFQs [37,38], and our ability to adjust for a variety of variables. However, several limitations of our study should also be noted and considered as opportunities for future work.",89749916-25ad-4774-a5dd-423590d67066
32,methods32," Our sample size, while in line with or larger than prior studies, was relatively small, particularly in Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI). This may have limited our ability to detect associations and what may have been more modest differences by background familial likelihood. Furthermore, while we hypothesize that the modest differences in cohort results may be due to this differing background likelihood, and we have ensured similarity of exposure and outcome measurements, we cannot rule out other study design or population differences playing into such cross-cohort comparisons. Dietary intake information in Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) was not measured during pregnancy for all participants. Results were broadly similar in analysis stratified by pregnancy and lactation, but were somewhat stronger for the pregnancy group.",bcb6a0b8-428b-4567-8b9f-ca2816ad006b
33,methods33," The timing of Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) dietary data represented early pregnancy (first 20 weeks), while Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) spanned a larger period of time also outside of pregnancy, and thus results may have been biased towards the null if the critical window of these dietary factors was more specifically tied to late pregnancy (a period of rapid brain growth and uptake of key nutrients such as PUFAs). Prior research has suggested pre- and during-pregnancy diet was fairly stable in the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) [60,61]; nonetheless, timing may be an important future consideration. In addition, while prior work has validated these and other FFQs and our goal was to summarize associations with patterns of usual intake, reported diet is known to be measured with error, and we did not have biomarker-based comparisons with which to validate intake.",fde72958-ed98-4bf9-9892-5ed33026f788
34,methods34," Future work examining multiple nutrients and complex dose–response relationships may benefit from the addition of biomarker and metabolomics data. Finally, we cannot rule out potential residual confounding by aspects such as maternal phenotypic factors that may influence dietary habits (as suggested in some work [62]) and that also relate to child autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related traits; however, supplemental analyses adjusting for maternal Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores where available did not change conclusions.  5. Conclusions  Dietary patterns represent useful tools for understanding and communicating how usual intake of foods relates to outcomes. Patterns more closely assess diet as it is experienced, and also help capture combined effects of dietary factors.",1714bcbd-3a61-4953-8bcb-99ef094c33bd
35,methods35," Though we did not observe strong associations between maternal dietary patterns and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related outcomes in the two cohorts studied here, future work should consider following up on suggestive findings. This includes addressing potential associations with more pro-inflammatory or unhealthy diets and examining the role of diet in potential critical windows of neurodevelopment. In addition, extensions of this work addressing how dietary patterns may modify associations with other risk factors that share the same pathways are needed.
