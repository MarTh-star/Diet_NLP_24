0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design and Participants The current study was conducted within the framework of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) trial. Briefly, PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) was a multicentre, randomized, primary prevention feeding trial with blinded assessment of end points carried out in Spain with the aim of evaluating the effects of the MedDiet on primary cardiovascular prevention (www.predimed.es). The study design has been described elsewhere [15,16], and it was approved by the Research Ethics Committees at all of the recruiting centres in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. The Institutional Review Board of the Navarra recruitment centre approved the study protocol (protocol 50/2005). All participants provided written informed consent. This trial was registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number system 35739639.",8f1b7b1b-5c85-4773-8e29-05303b7664eb
1,methods1,"  Eligible participants in PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) trial were men aged 55–80 and women aged 60–80 years without any previous history of cardiovascular disease. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been described elsewhere [15,16]. Participants were randomized to one of three nutrition interventions: a MedDiet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (MedDiet + extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)), a MedDiet supplemented with mixed nuts (MedDiet + nuts), or advice in reducing all sources of fat, which was the control group. All of the groups received dietary training and questionnaires about medical conditions, food consumption (such as 137-item validated food-frequency questionnaire) [17], and physical activity (Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire) [16] were completed as described elsewhere [15]. Data of anthropometric measures, body composition and blood pressure were collected in the same consultations following standardized procedures [10].",9f47a1d3-ce75-41f3-bed4-d1f024185633
2,methods2," Plasma, serum, and buffy-coat were stored (−80 °C) and biochemical features were evaluated, as described elsewhere [10].  For this study, participants were selected from the recruitment centre at the University of Navarra following different criteria: non-smokers or former-smokers, same proportion of women and men, and aged between 60 and 70 years old, enrolling a total of 36 participants (12 from each diet) with data at baseline and at five years of intervention.  2.2. DNA Extraction and DNA Methylation Analysis The procedures for DNA extraction from buffy coat (PWBCs) of venous blood samples have been described elsewhere [12]. The extracted DNA was sent on dry ice to Unidad de Genotipado y Diagnóstico Genético from Fundación Investigación Clínico de Valencia, where bisulphite treatment was performed and Infinium HumanMethylation450K bead chip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for DNA methylation analysis as described elsewhere [12].  2.3.",91963b6f-1a4a-4741-83dc-b5a888a0e76a
3,methods3," Treatment of Methylation Raw Data Normalization of microarray data was performed in R by a categorical subset quantile normalization method using the pipeline developed by Touleimat & Tost [18]. After data normalization, Linear Models for Microarray Data (Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA)) [19] was used to identify the probes with significant differential methylation changes (five years–baseline) between two diets, being the comparisons: MedDiet + extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) vs. low-fat control diet and MedDiet + nuts vs. low-fat control diet. The linear model was adjusted for age, sex, and microarray chip. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus [20] and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE107205 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE107205).  2.4.",2fac7044-280b-48e3-a81d-68bf5f82416b
4,methods4," Ingenuity Pathway Analysis From all the significant CpGs that were obtained after Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) analysis, a selection was carried out in order to have an appropriate number of CpGs for obtaining relevant results in the analysis of canonical pathways by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)) platform (Qiagen Redwood City, CA, USA, www.ingenuity.com). CpGs with a p < 0.005 and effect size ≤−9 or ≥9 (the effect size represents the methylation change for the CpG site in %) were selected. Predefined pathways and functional categories of the Ingenuity Knowledge Base were used in order to detect associated pathways and relevant gene regulatory networks [21]. Canonical pathways with a p < 0.05 after Fisher’s test were defined as a statistically significant overrepresentation of input genes in a given process.  2.5.",276f99d2-f7ff-4543-926d-8afd28e6b3e8
5,methods5," Differential CpG Site Selection In order to select CpGs presenting a higher effect on methylation with biological implications that could be noticeable and minimize the type I error rate, a series of statistically restricted selections with stringent criteria were performed. CpG sites were selected by B-values (statistic of differential methylation generated in Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) package) >0 and effect size ≤−9 or ≥9 for both of the comparisons. Moreover, methylation values must not be significantly different among the three dietary groups at baseline, but show differences throughout the intervention. The tests that were used in these cases were ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test or Kruskal-Wallis with Mann-Whitney’s U test, when appropriate, and Student-t test or sign test, when appropriate. Then, regression models between selected CpGs methylation and foods or their components, adjusted for diabetes and BMI, were performed.  2.6.",6a80df2e-cb54-413a-a84d-6a3c8d78ffc0
6,methods6," Blood Cell Type Composition Differences in the composition of types of leukocytes between five years and baseline were correlated (Pearson) with nuts intake at five years, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption at five years and with methylation of the CpGs selected. Differences among dietary groups in the composition of blood cells were also assessed.  2.7. Statistical Analysis of Participants Anthropometric and biochemical features of participants and food consumption were characterised and tested comparing the three groups at baseline, at five years and their differences (five years-baseline) using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test (for quantitative variables) and Chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, or Cochran test (for qualitative variables), as appropriate. The values were also compared for each diet between five years and baseline using Student t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Sign test, or Cochran test, when advised. The Shapiro-Wilk analysis was used to test normality.",be9fd810-7886-4a45-9dd7-84b402059086
7,methods7,"  Statistical calculations and graphs were performed using STATA version 12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) and GraphPad Prism 6 (Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA, USA), respectively. The statistically significant level was set at p < 0.05.  3. Results 3.1. Participants’ Differences in Anthropometric and Biochemical Features, Food Consumption and Blood Cell Type Composition The three dietary groups showed no differences in anthropometric and biochemical features, except for HDL cholesterol levels measured at five years. Concerning clinical manifestations, the three groups exhibited a significant decrease in diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and arterial hypertension cases after five years of intervention, except for diabetes in low-fat control diet and for arterial hypertension in MedDiet + nuts group, which did not present significant differences (Table 1).  Energy and nutrient intakes were also recorded (Table 2).",5b8273a0-2ccb-461b-9962-184bd69f5dd0
8,methods8," At the baseline, no significant differences between groups were noted. The highest significant differences were observed for nuts and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption at five years among the three groups. Moreover, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption was statistically different between five years and baseline in MedDiet + extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group. Some differences were also observed in fruit intake between five years and baseline in low-fat control diet and MedDiet + nuts group, as well as in red meat intake in MedDiet + extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group. There were also differences in legumes intake between five years and baseline in MedDiet + nuts group and among the three groups.",b2921370-7b1d-4290-b798-263e41a1a392
9,methods9,"  Since methylation measured in PWBCs can vary by blood cell type, and thus the methylation changes that are associated with the variables investigated in this study may reflect an alteration in blood cell composition, correlation studies were performed between the relative proportions of granulocytes, lymphocytes, or mid cells and nuts intake, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake or methylation of the selected CpGs, but no associations for any comparison were found (Supplementary Materials Table S1). There were also no differences in blood cell types among the three dietary groups (Supplementary Materials Table S2).  3.2. Relevant Differentially Methylated CpGs Were Related to Metabolism, Inflammation, Intracellular Signals and Diabetes For Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) analysis, 223 CpGs from MedDiet + extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) vs. low-fat control diet comparison and 359 CpGs from MedDiet + nuts vs. low-fat control diet were analysed.",454db48e-c62d-42c5-841f-32a5f86cff91
10,methods10," The obtained canonical pathways were collected for both comparisons (Supplementary Materials Table S3 and Table S4, respectively). Some CpGs from both of the comparisons were related to metabolism, such as Fatty Acid Activation, γ-linolenate Biosynthesis II, Fatty Acid β-oxidation I, Fatty Acid α-oxidation, and Adipogenesis pathway. CpGs from MedDiet + extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) vs. low-fat control diet comparison were related to pathways that were involved in inflammation, such as Leukocyte extravasation signaling, LPS/IL-1 Mediated Inhibition of retinoid acid receptor function, and Crosstalk between Dendritic Cells and Natural Killer Cells. On the other hand, CpGs from MedDiet + nuts vs. low-fat control diet comparison were related to a variety of intracellular signals (apoptosis and DNA damage, Protein kinase A, Notch, G-Protein coupled receptor, Stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, etc.), and with diabetes (Type II Diabetes Mellitus Signalling).  3.3.",f3c7f54e-9309-4d6f-8b1a-261bf765fc5c
11,methods11," Two Differentially Methylated CpGs (cg01081346 and cg17071192) Were Selected After those preliminary analyses, CpGs were selected by B-values >0 and effect size ≤ −9 or ≥ 9 for both comparisons, as well as by showing non-significant differences in methylation values among the three dietary groups at baseline and showing significant differences throughout the intervention. Two CpGs were obtained: cg01081346 and cg17071192. The CpG cg01081346 presented an increase in methylation in MedDiet + nuts after five years of intervention (Figure 1a), and showed significant higher methylation changes in MedDiet + nuts subjects when comparing with the other two dietary groups (Figure 1b). In addition, nuts intake (g/day) at five years of follow-up was associated with an increase in cg01081346 methylation (Figure 1c).",18c99813-d87a-4825-9dc1-b8b4c7df2f73
12,methods12," The other CpG (cg17071192) presented a methylation decrease in MedDiet + extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) throughout the intervention (Figure 2a) and showed significant differences in methylation changes between the MedDiet + extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group and the other two groups (Figure 2b). The corresponding genes for these CpGs, according to the Illumina CG database, were CPT1B/CHKB-CPT1B (Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B/Choline kinase-like, Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B) for cg01081346, located at the TSS220, TSS1500 (CPT1B) and body of the gene (CHKB-CPT1B), and gene (GNASAS) and TSS1500 (GNAS)/gene (gene (GNASAS) and TSS1500 (GNAS)AS) (Guanine Nucleotide Binding Protein (G Protein), Alpha Stimulating Activity Polypeptide 1/gene (GNASAS) and TSS1500 (GNAS) Antisense RNA 1) for cg17071192, located at the body of the gene (gene (gene (GNASAS) and TSS1500 (GNAS)AS)) and TSS1500 (gene (GNASAS) and TSS1500 (GNAS)).  3.4.",6906e906-a0fc-42d7-9cf8-da8a060f2c7f
13,methods13," CpG cg01081346 Was Associated with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)s In order to check whether fatty acids were related to methylation changes, other regression analyses were performed between methylation changes of CpGs and total lipids, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)s) that were consumed at five years. Results showed that methylation of cg01081346 was associated with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)s (Figure 3), whereas cg17071192 presented no association.  4. Discussion The current study demonstrates that a MedDiet pattern plus specific food supplements rich in different fat quality, in this case nuts and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), could induce changes in methylation levels in specific CpGs of PWBCs. Therefore, further insights are added to previous reports where environmental factors, including the diet, were able to modify the epigenome [22].",23c24361-0413-40af-83c8-384c160c1ddc
14,methods14,"  MedDiets supplemented with nuts or extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) have evidenced beneficial effects in individuals with cardiovascular risk [8]. Among these effects, decreased levels of LDL cholesterol and increased levels of HDL cholesterol were observed [23]. In the subset of participants selected for this study, there were differences among the three groups in HDL cholesterol. In fact, the low-fat dietary control group decreased HDL levels, whereas MedDiet + extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) maintained the levels and MedDiet + nuts increased them. In most cases, there was a reduction in the incidence of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and arterial pressure, indicating a general improvement in health status after each dietary intervention.",be4223ce-bf51-47d2-a830-5f8829977c40
15,methods15,"  Regarding MedDiet supplements intake, although MedDiet + extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group presented differences in consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) at five years and in changes between five years and baseline, MedDiet + nuts only showed differences in nuts intake at five years. This result could be influenced by the initial values of nuts consumption of the MedDiet + nuts group, which were higher than in the other two groups, although not statistically significant. Some dietary groups presented differences in other foods intake, probably due to dietary advice.  The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) strategy revealed that the selected differentially methylated genes were mainly related to intermediate metabolism, inflammation, intracellular signals, and diabetes phenomena.",544f8cfe-1016-4185-8d22-fe8c4bd79431
16,methods16," These areas are interconnected and MedDiets supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts have been described as having a favourable impact in different features related to them, such as inflammatory parameters, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, among others [8,9]. Thus, MedDiet, and especially the food supplements employed, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts, could be inducing changes in the DNA methylation, which in turn, may cause changes in the expression of some genes that are associated with these processes and related diseases. For instance, Rodríguez-Miguel et al. showed that an olive oil-enriched diet increased levels of global methylation in mammary glands and tumours [13]. In addition, adherence to MedDiet has been associated with changes in methylation in inflammatory-related genes in a previous study from this group [12].",2081f6a7-d4a8-41a8-91fb-958e3e284435
17,methods17," Further studies of the relationship between significant genes and the pathways from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) would be interesting to elucidate their putative involvement in MedDiet health beneficial effects.  After an exhaustive analytical selection in order to choose the most relevant CpGs that had diet-induced methylation changes, two CpGs were specifically analysed: cg01081346–CPT1B/CHKB-CPT1B and cg17071192-gene (GNASAS) and TSS1500 (GNAS)/gene (gene (GNASAS) and TSS1500 (GNAS)AS). Interestingly, three surrounding CpGs of 27 for CPT1B/CHKB-CPT1B and 13 CpGs of 129 for gene (GNASAS) and TSS1500 (GNAS)/gene (gene (GNASAS) and TSS1500 (GNAS)AS) also showed significant differences (p < 0.05). These CpGs may be related to the expression of genes performing actions that were in agreement with the differentially methylated areas obtained in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). For instance, CPT1B has been related to insulin sensitivity and cardiac risk [24,25].",ba946131-809a-41d0-8b4b-29f37602c33c
18,methods18," This gene is implicated in the conversion of acyl-CoA and carnitine into acyl-carnitine in the outer membrane of mitochondria, determining the balance between glucose and fatty acid metabolism [26]. The levels of these molecules are very important in lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes metabolism [27]. On the other hand, gene (gene (GNASAS) and TSS1500 (GNAS)AS) encodes for an antisense RNA transcript that regulates gene (GNASAS) and TSS1500 (GNAS), which has been involved in glucose and energy regulation [28,29]. Although methylation levels were measured in PWBCs, which are not very related to some of the aforementioned functions, these cells could be proxies for less accessible tissues [30]. Indeed, differentially methylated CpGs in blood cells have been identified as mirroring the adipose tissue methylation pattern [31].  Nuts and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) are both rich in MUFAs and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)s [32,33].",ff6b8d04-e985-40e7-a084-388d5e855de0
19,methods19," In fact, in this study, methylation of CpG cg01081346 was associated with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) uptake. It is likely that this CpGs could be influenced by fat quality due to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)s consumed in nuts. Indeed, it has been described that the quality of dietary fat influences the methylation of genes [34]. Nevertheless, the CpG cg17071192 might change the methylation pattern due to other MedDiet nutrients or other compounds that are present in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). For instance, polyphenols from extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) have been described down-regulating proatherogenic genes [35], while some derivatives (hydroxityrosol, tyrosol, and their secoiridoid derivatives) have shown strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in vitro [36,37].",d071fb94-b9ef-462c-9247-bacb860d7d11
20,methods20," In addition, the stimulatory effect of phenolic extracts from extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and hydroxityrosol on cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) expression inversely correlated with DNA methylation at cannabinoid receptor 1 promoter and it was associated with reduced proliferation of human colon cancer cells [38].  The present investigation was not devoid of limitations. Firstly, the sample size is relatively low, but the results are plausible. Secondly, mRNA levels could be evaluated in order to determine extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts roles on the modification of the methylation levels and in turn, the effect on the expression of genes with a function in the maintenance of a good health status.  5. Conclusions Summing up, this study shows that an intervention with MedDiet + extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and MedDiet + nuts in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Navarra trial are influencing the methylation of genes in PWBCs.",976b75f7-7294-4d25-9907-5cb819623219
21,methods21," This effect might be, in part, due to the fat profile of either extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts. Specifically, methylation changes occurs in genes related to intermediate metabolism, diabetes, inflammation, and signal transduction process, such as CPT1B and gene (GNASAS) and TSS1500 (GNAS), which are specifically involved in acyl-carnitine process in mitochondria, and glucose and energy regulation, respectively. Hence, the potential beneficial effects on health of Mediterranean dietary pattern supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts could be mediated, at least in part, through epigenetic mechanisms, where the quality of fat intake, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) consumption, is playing a mediating role.
