0,introduction0,"A Mediterranean-style eating pattern (Mediterranean pattern) is one of the eating patterns recommended by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans to reduce chronic disease risk1,2. While there are cultural variations in the foods and beverages included in a Mediterranean pattern, overall it is largely plant-based, relatively high in olive oil and seafood, but low in dairy, red meat, and refined grains1,3,4. Observational and experimental studies suggest that higher adherence to a Mediterranean pattern is associated with improved cardiovascular disease risk factors5–7, reduced risk of cardiovascular events8,9, and reduced cardiovascular-related mortality9,10. The American Diabetes Association recommends adherence to a Mediterranean pattern, as one of several potential strategies, to prevent cardiovascular complications in individuals with diabetes.",61e5fa13-1135-45bc-a903-c2da2cb6aca4
1,introduction1," However, evidence regarding how Mediterranean pattern adherence can improve diabetes risk for U.S. populations is inconsistent11.  It is unclear if a Mediterranean pattern, independent of a Mediterranean lifestyle, can reduce diabetes risk in US adult populations11. Mediterranean and European populations tend to be less racially and ethnically heterogeneous, have lower body mass indexes (body mass index (BMI)), be less sedentary, have larger social networks, and place a greater emphasis on rest and sleep compared to the general U.S. population12,13. In Mediterranean and other European settings, adherence to a Mediterranean pattern is consistently associated with a reduced risk of diabetes14–16. Yet, research about Mediterranean pattern adherence and diabetes risk in U.S. populations is limited and inconsistent11.",0d6d1ec6-b3a0-4c4e-b10e-4dbf0ee88c0e
2,introduction2," Research is needed to assess whether potential benefits of a Mediterranean pattern are translatable to heterogeneous populations which place less emphasis on ideologies and behaviors of Mediterranean-like cultures. Further, benefits may vary by race and body mass index (BMI). Being of a minority race and having a body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2 are among the top recognized risk factors for diabetes in the U.S. and eating habits differ within these groups17.  The purpose of this study was to assess associations between Mediterranean pattern scores and incident diabetes in a U.S. community-based population of adults. We also explored consistency of associations within racial and body mass index (BMI) subgroups17. ",79c21f56-383a-4748-a103-bfccc9fe2f31

Associations between aMed scores and incident diabetes were stronger among black compared to white participants, were stronger for normal weight compared to overweight or obese participants, and were not different for males and females. Higher nut and legume intake, moderate alcohol intake, and lower red and processed meat intake were the main drivers of the noted associations.

In a smaller but more ethnically diverse U.S. cohort, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (n = 5,290), there was no association between Mediterranean pattern scores and diabetes risk in the overall population or within racial subgroups30. The larger sample size of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study allowed for more precise white vs black comparisons than these prior studies. We found stronger associations between Mediterranean pattern adherence and incident diabetes for black compared to white participants.",1195161f-b910-4ff1-b5df-02fb915c9adc
25,discussion2," This is contrary to previous research which showed inverse associations between a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-style eating pattern and diabetes risk only for white individuals in a cohort that was comprised largely of black and Hispanic individuals31. There is a need for follow-up research regarding the finding that black individuals may particularly benefit from adherence to a Mediterranean pattern because of the high risk of diabetes in this racial subgroup27.  Unlike data from U.S. cohorts, associations between higher Mediterranean pattern scores and reduced diabetes risk are consistent from Mediterranean/European cohorts14–16. One hypothesis is that this may be due to cultural practices of a Mediterranean lifestyle. Lifestyle and food choices have changed in the Mediterranean region since Ancel Key’s discovery of the cardioprotective Mediterranean pattern12.",a2a85bad-4591-43bc-9205-6dbe44bcec42
26,discussion3," Modernized farming practices and industrialization of the food supply have led to increased body mass index (BMI) and higher cardiovascular disease risk in the same geographic regions that Keys first mapped out32. However, daily physical activity, close social networks, shared family meals, adequate rest, and abundant social exchanges of a Mediterranean lifestyle still persist as protective disease factors into the twenty-first century13. Aside from physical activity, these factors were not measured in Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) so it is difficult to determine whether these behaviors would modify associations between Mediterranean pattern adherence and chronic disease risk in our population.  Obtaining and maintaining a healthy body weight is recognized as the most influential modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes prevention17.",166ec13b-05bd-435e-85db-cc7e3c421821
27,discussion4," We found that associations between aMed score and incident diabetes was stronger among participants with a normal body mass index (BMI) at baseline. The results of this analysis suggest that the detrimental health implications of being overweight or obese override potential health benefits of a Mediterranean pattern. This theme is previously noted in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study33,34, as well as other U.S. populations27, for associations between healthy eating patterns and various chronic disease outcomes. Additionally, previous controlled feeding trials in individuals without diabetes showed little improvement in fasting markers of glycemic control when adopting a weight-maintenance Mediterranean pattern7 or other heart healthy eating pattern33–37 in the absence of body weight reductions >2 kilograms. However, markers of glycemic control can improve regardless of eating pattern composition in trials that prescribe intentional weight loss for participants38,39.",68436034-31ff-4f39-b78a-3ca023dde87f
28,discussion5," Therefore, our results align with those of randomized controlled trials which suggest that adopting a healthy eating pattern in the absence of weight loss may not meaningfully reduce diabetes risk or associated risk factors in overweight or obese populations. While adherence to a healthy eating pattern high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains could potentially result in lower diabetes risk among those with normal body mass index (BMI), discussion of calorie restriction to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight should remain at the forefront of diabetes prevention.  The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was not a priori designed to assess adherence to a Mediterranean pattern. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) contains no questions about olive oil intake, which is the main staple of a Mediterranean pattern. Further, limited variation in fruit, vegetable, and whole-grain eating habits of U.S.",4fc1fec6-048d-4b47-a077-0e01bb39770f
29,discussion6," populations, as well as the lack of adequate whole-grain related food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) questions, may not be sufficient to correctly identify independent associations with diabetes. Due to the aMed rank-based scoring system used to assess Mediterranean pattern adherence, no quintile met commonly recommended food group intake thresholds of a more traditional Mediterranean patterns for nuts, fats, vegetables, or whole grains1,3. Further, a traditional Mediterranean pattern is commonly recognized to be high in total and/or monounsaturated fat (up to 40% and 20% of total energy, respectively)3,4. The higher quintiles in this study reported lower total fat and saturated fat intakes than the lower quintiles with limited variability in mono- and polyunsaturated fat across quintiles. To note, about half of monounsaturated fatty acids consumed by U.S. populations come from red meat, not olive oil.",852859d7-cf86-463f-ba06-6876ec218fbf
30,discussion7," The associations noted between aMed scores and diabetes risk in this study are not applicable to a traditional high total and monounsaturated fat (from olive oil) Mediterranean pattern. Switching to a high-fat eating pattern of any kind could potentially cause weight-gain and increase diabetes risk because all fat types are energy dense40.  Our study can address previously noted gaps in the literature about eating patterns and chronic disease risk. The observed inverse associations between Mediterranean pattern adherence and incident diabetes may be more precise and generalizable to the U.S. population than previous studies because the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is a large cohort of both men and women, and blacks and whites, representing four different U.S. regions. We also used a highly sensitive measure of incident diabetes (doctor diagnosis, medication usage, and blood glucose concentrations), although largely self-reported23.",84173671-4ffa-4a48-95a2-eda9277092a6
31,discussion8," Although type 1 vs type 2 diabetes cases were indistinguishable via these ascertainment methods, 90–95% of diabetes cases in the U.S. are type 2 diabetes41. Further, type 2 diabetes most often presents in individuals over the age of 4541. We excluded diabetes cases at baseline and participant age at enrollment was >45 years. Therefore, it is assumed that incident diabetes cases in this sample are largely type 2 diabetes. Further, while dietary intake assessments were self-reported, using the average of two measurements (visit 1 and visit 3) is expected to reduce measurement error and increase precision of exposure-outcome associations42. The temporal nature of assessing Mediterranean pattern adherence at baseline with a median of 22 follow-up years is another strength of this study.  Unmeasured and residual confounding in observational studies can remain after multivariable adjustments.",c0ec2e92-40a9-465f-9e19-618b48999c03
32,discussion9," Specifically, associations between Mediterranean pattern adherence and diabetes were negated in participants who were overweight or obese. However, energy intake was highest in the fifth quintile with limited variation in body mass index (BMI) and physical activity across quintiles. Energy calculations from food frequency questionnaires tend to be unreliable and there was no objective measure of energy intake (such as doubly labeled water) used in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study to validate the energy intake reported in Table 2. To address this source of potential confounding, the multivariable regression models were adjusted for total energy intake. However, more generally, individuals in the U.S. who adhere to a healthy eating pattern often have other healthy lifestyle behaviors such as being physically active, refraining from smoking, and have financial and educational means to make healthier lifestyle choices.",99c83595-ca6d-4db9-833b-503c68655cdc
33,discussion10," This extent of residual confounding after adjusting for these factors is unknown.  An eating pattern high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and fish, and moderate in alcohol, similar to the Mediterranean-style eating pattern assessed in this analysis and recommended by the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, was associated with an overall lower risk of diabetes in a community-based U.S. population. This association was particularly strong for black and normal weight individuals but was absent for individuals who were overweight or obese. Increased awareness and promotion of healthy eating patterns for diabetes prevention in predominantly black communities may reduce disease burden. Future research is needed to assess if a calorically restrictive Mediterranean-style eating pattern, resulting in clinically meaningful weight loss, can reduce future diabetes risk in individuals who are overweight or obese.",e513c8f2-3189-4e4c-b7a8-e81b5a6a1fa8
