Samples  Three samples of cooked pasta were analyzed and tested: one sample of wholemeal buckwheat pasta (1), one sample of wholemeal rye pasta (2) and one sample of egg pasta of stone-ground durum wheat flour (3).  2.2. Pasta Samples Preparation  Totals of 50 g of whole meal buckwheat pasta or whole meal rye pasta were cooked in 500 mL of water for 7 min; 50 g of egg pasta of stone-ground durum wheat flour were cooked in 500 mL of water for 1 min, as indicated by the manufacturer.  To obtain extracts enriched in carotenoids, 10 g of cooked pasta were dissolved in 100 mL acetone, cold sonicated for 30 min. The sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm, the supernatant has been dry evaporated with a rotary evaporator and the residue was dissolved in acetone or DMSO depending on the downstream analysis. To obtain extracts enriched in polyphenols, 10 g of each sample of cooked pasta were dissolved in 50 mL of 70:30 EtOH/H2O at pH 3.2.",5ade4989-09ef-454f-9743-a44df2cf3059

The sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm and the supernatant was collected and analyzed in HPLC-DAD, while an aliquot was dry evaporated, and the residue dissolved in DMSO for cell treatment.  2.3. HPLC-DA-MS Analysis  Quali-quantitative analyses of carotenoids and polyphenols were carried out using an HP 1100 liquid chromatography equipped with a DAD detector and managed by an HP 9000 workstation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and linked to a mass spectrometer with an API/electrospray interface (Agilent Technologies). The mass spectrometer operating conditions were as follows: gas temperature, 350 °C; nitrogen flow rate, 11.0 L/min; nebulizer pressure, 40 psi; quadrupole temperature, 100 °C; and capillary voltage, 4000 V. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive and negative modes at 80–180 eV.  Compounds were separated using a 250 × 4.6 mm i.",ddbe2e4c-a42a-436a-8aff-43ffe12711ca

The samples were analyzed by gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The mobile phase for carotenoids was a multistep linear solvent gradient system (solvent A: acetone, solvent B: H2O, pH 3.2 by formic acid), starting from 80% acetone up to 100% in 30 min. polyphenols were eluted using the following gradient: from 90% H2O (adjusted to pH 3.2 by formic acid) to 100% CH3CN in 40 min. All solvents used were of HPLC grade purity (BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, UK).  2.4. Quantitative Analysis  Quantification of individual polyphenolic compounds was directly performed by HPLC-DAD using a five-point regression curve (R2 ≥ 0.998) in the range of 0–30 µg on the basis of authentic standards.",0d0e760c-8565-422e-85b3-2f3dbb1fb624
3,methods3," In particular, flavonols were determined at 350 nm using quercetin 3-O-glucoside as reference compound while caffeic acid derivatives were determined at 330 nm using clorogenic acid as reference compound and indoleacetic acid derivative at 280 nm using 3 indoleacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Carotenoids were determined at 450 nm using β beta-carotene as reference compound (Extrasynthese, Lione, Francia). In all cases, actual concentrations of the derivatives were calculated after applying corrections for differences in molecular weight.  2.5. Total Phenolic Content  The total phenolic content was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu method, described by Singleton et al. [57] and slightly modified according to Dewanto et al. [58]. To 125 µL of the suitably diluted sample extract, 0.5 mL of deionized water and 125 µL of the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent were added. The mixture was kept for 6 min and then 1.25 mL of a 7% aqueous Na2CO3 solution were added.",c59d17f6-6be7-44ce-9eb3-c6f5314df083

5,methods5," For viability studies, cells were incubated for 24 h to 72 h with beta-carotene, indole-3-acetic acid, caffeic acid (in DMSO) and pasta extracts alone or in presence of magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP), Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). DMSO in the medium at equal concentrations to those used for the tested compounds was used for untreated samples. The tested concentration for the standards were ranging from 2 pM to 10 µM, while for magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) from 0.001 to 0.05 mg/mL. Cell viability were measured 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then the Formazan produced by the MTT reduction was solubilized in DMSO.

6,methods6," Statistical Analysis  Each experiment was performed in quadruplicate and repeated at least three times. Differences in viability percentages were assessed using paired Student’s t test and two-way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc test with Holm’s correction for multiple comparison over concentrations metabolites (p < 0.05). Results were expressed as mean ± standard error and the analysis were performed by R-Studio environment [59] for R version 3.6.3 [60] using the package “Tidyverse” [61].  3. Results and Discussion  3.1. Determination of the Chemical Quality of Pasta Samples  The nutritional information of a food allows making informed food and dietary choices. Pasta is traditionally prepared from semolina but even with other cereals, all contain starch as a principal constituent followed by protein, fat, vitamins, minerals and bioactive compounds [62]. In Table S1 are reported the nutritional data.",6a1024f4-4317-4198-a78a-7635d6b7ce03
7,methods7,"  To compare the nutritional values of several types of pasta enriched in bioactive compounds due to the different source of cereals or to the supplementation of specific ingredients, we analyzed buckwheat pasta, rye pasta and egg pasta. In order to obtain extracts enriched in the various subclasses of compounds present in the pasta samples, both hydroalcoholic and acetone extractions were carried out and analyzed. Individual polyphenols were tentatively identified using data from HPLC-DAD-MS analysis by comparison and combination of their retention times and mass spectrometry and UV spectra (see Figures S1–S5 for same example of MS spectra) and comparing results with standards (kaempferol, quercetin, rutin and ferulic acid) and previous bibliographic works. In particular, in hydroalcoholic extracts, flavonoids, caffeic and indoleacetic acid derivatives were identified (Table 1): the indoleacetic acid derivative is the main compound as described before even for semolina. [63].",d0c59c74-4124-4876-8bf7-e78f273dc5de
8,methods8," Considering relative compositions, buckwheat pasta showed higher levels of flavonoids, in particular quercetin derivatives are the main flavonols as previously reported in buckwheat [64,65], and negligible presence of caffeic acid derivatives; rye pasta showed higher levels of caffeic acid derivatives, in particular ferulic acid [66] and low content of flavonoids; egg pasta presented only low concentration of flavonoids (apigenin derivative [67]) and no presence of caffeic acid derivatives.  As an example, the chromatographic profiles of cooked pasta samples, recorded at 350 nm, are presented in Figure 1. The figure reveals the qualitative composition of the samples analyzed.  Even carotenoids were pointed out in egg pasta and buckwheat pasta, and Figure 2 shows the HPLC-DAD chromatogram (450 nm) of the acetone extract of cooked egg pasta sample.",b8128b36-bc41-40f3-8526-ea846714026a
9,methods9,"  Lutein was the main carotenoid identified in the acetone extracts, with similar relative content with respect to the overall carotenoids species, as shown in Table 2, in line with previous studies [68]. Carotenoids were not detected in rye pasta.  The presence of antioxidant secondary metabolites has been evaluated in the pasta samples as well (Table 3). The total antioxidant capacity of biocomponents, likely due to the activity of phenol/polyphenol was assessed and the amount of such molecules was deduced.  Buckwheat pasta sample has higher values than other pasta’s samples in terms of total phenolic content.  3.2. Effect of Indole-3-Acetic Acid, β-Carotene and Caffeic Acid on Cells Viability  Mediterranean diet has been recognized as a source of anti-oxidant molecules, which protect the organism against oxidative stress and support the healthy status [2]. Therefore, we wondered whether the biomolecules detected in our pasta samples can affect cell viability and at which extent.",0ae9eb10-b094-489a-845c-94177e90a823
10,methods10," We used HEK-293 and Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) healthy kidney cells to determine the activity of indoleacetic acid, β-carotene and caffeic acid standard compounds. The kidney is especially susceptible to oxidative stress and the accumulation of free radicals leads to renal impaired function [69]. Cells were incubated with scalar concentration of the standard compounds and the cell viability was measured at different time points (Figure 3 and Figure S6).  They were found not to exert any toxic effect on HEK-293 cells for all the tested concentrations at times of incubation. Only β-carotene reduced cell viability in a u-shape manner on HEK-293 cells and in a dose-dependent manner in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Figure 3).",487de5f5-cdda-4f69-a236-155db0031c9c
11,methods11," Remarkably, the concentrations likely reached in body after the consumption of a standard pasta meal (usually 80 gr) are in the range of the lowest tested (2 × 10−5–2 × 10−4 µM, [70,71]), which provided a weak enhancement of the viability on both cell lines. On the other hand, at higher concentrations above 0.2 μM, which can be obtained only pharmacologically, caffeic acid showed a significant improvement of the cell viability, while indoleacetic acid and β-carotene showed comparable effects along the increase of concentration (2–20 µM) in HEK-293 cells along the time.  3.3. Effect of Indole-3-Acetic Acid, β-Carotene and Caffeic Acid on magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP)-Treated Cells  We next wondered if indoleacetic acid, β-carotene and caffeic acid can counteract a stress induced by the oxidizing agent magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP).",8b8bdfcb-f527-4c70-96a1-90507a0db3f1
12,methods12," First, we tested the magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) effect by exposing HEK-293 and Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to serial dilutions (0.005–0.05 mg/mL) to the drug and the cell viability was determined. A dose-dependent decrease following magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) treatment was noticed and the IC50 was comparable in the two cell lines tested. After incubation with 20–25 µg/mL magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) the cell viability was significantly decreased to around 50–60% (Figure 4) and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated to be 26 µg/mL for HEK-293 and 22 µg/mL for Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK).  Then, we tested the protective activity of our anti-oxidant molecules on magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP)-treated cells, by supplementing the cell media with 2 × 10−5 nM indoleacetic, β-carotene or caffeic acid.",8634ed86-5435-4029-878d-6159b0d51b9e
13,methods13," A slightly positive effect on cell viability of both HEK-293 and Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) was confirmed by employing the standards as such at the dose likely derived from a pasta portion (Figure 5).  As expected, magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) reduced the call viability to 60–65%; the treatment with indoleacetic acid or β-carotene counteract the magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) effect and rescued the cell viability by 30% (p < 0.001) and 27% (p > 0.01) respectively on HEK-293 cells, while caffeic acid did not exert any significant effect. In the presence of an oxidant agent, beta-carotene and indoleacetic acid showed a protective effect on the cells at a low concentration, whereas caffeic acid did not counteract oxidative stress at the concentration needed to enhance cell viability.",2709e99f-12b5-499a-8f3e-c4c05919c7fe
14,methods14," Those positive effects are likely due to the antioxidant properties of indoleacetic acid and carotenoids that can significantly counterbalance the magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP)-mediated cytotoxicity at the dose used in this experimental condition. Nevertheless, no significant rescue was observed on magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP)-treated Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, suggesting that, even of standards alone displayed a significantly positive effect on cell viability, they are not sufficient to tackle the magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP)-induced oxidative stress. Embryonal HEK-293 cells seem to be more prompt to arrange a defense line against stress than adult Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK), presumably due to additional cellular redox homeostasis systems.  3.4.",71594cd0-6789-4eab-a95f-61856053cd88
15,methods15," Effect of the Pasta-Derived Carotenoid-Enriched Fraction on magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP)-Induced Cytotoxicity  To evaluate the effects of the carotenoid-enriched fractions derived from the acetone extraction of buckwheat pasta and egg pasta on renal cells in the presence of oxidative stress, HEK-293 cells were incubated with different concentrations of extracts ranking from 2 × 10−6 µM to 2 × 10−3 µM in presence of magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) for 72 h (Figure 6 and Table S2). The concentration used refers to the of β-carotene concentration detected in the extract (Table 2). The lutein content ranged from 1.5 × 10−6 µM to 1.5 × 10−3 µM in Buckwheat pasta and from 1.34 × 10−6 µM to 1.34 × 10−3 µM in egg pasta.  In both acetone extracts, the presence of natural phytocomplexes, showed different effects with respect to the single standard, resulting more active at lower concentrations.",dc7aec2a-6d4d-493a-acc4-a75414cca585
16,methods16," As the concentration of extracts from egg pasta increases, a reduction of cell viability was observed. The lowest concentration of carotenoid extracts (2 × 10−6 µM) induced a modest positive effect alone or in the presence of magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) on HEK-293 cells. Buckwheat pasta extract generated an enhancement of cell viability as the extract alone, but also in the presence of magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) ranging from 32 ± 5% at lowest concentration to 21 ± 9% for 2 × 10−4 µM.  The activity of acetone extracts was assessed also on Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in presence or absence of magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) and compared with that obtained in HEK-293 cells (Figure 7 and Table S2).  Carotenoids-enriched extracts gave an overall pro-viability effect at all the tested concentrations for both types of pasta.",97e9fbee-d68a-46ed-96e7-6a1c755d7277
17,methods17," With respect to HEK-293 buckwheat pasta extract gave a better rescue upon magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) treatment for all the doses ranging from 50 ± 7% to 82 ± 5% compared to HEK-239 cells; extracts from egg pasta exerted a small rescue only at the lowest concentration of carotenoids 2 × 10−6 µM in the presence of magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP), suggesting that the specific composition of extracts plays a key role in the response. Thus, buckwheat pasta showed a greater rescue capacity on the cell viability with respect to egg pasta and since the experiments were performed using the same amount of β-carotene, the difference could be due to the presence of minor compounds, such as flavonoids compounds, higher in the former.",099f8e66-627c-401c-9164-c9c4c95c0744
18,methods18,"  Carotenoids species are involved in different chemical reactions exerting a dual nature of oxidant and anti-oxidant depending the biological context and their concentrations: this high reactivity is due to the presence of the conjugated double bounds [72]. Their antioxidant role was associated with the ability to delocalize the electrons given by oxidative species and radicals [73,74]. In the presence of high oxidative conditions their activity may be converted to pro-oxidant [75]. In our cases, this finding was observed in egg pasta for HEK-293 (both alone and in presence of magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP)) and Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in presence of magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP), where different doses of acetone extract produced opposite effects.  3.5.",917acd35-ce37-4879-97a1-7039d5af5d74
19,methods19," Effect of Hydroalcoholic Extract on magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP)-Induced Cytotoxicity  Afterwards, we evaluated the effects of the hydroalcoholic extracts from of buckwheat pasta, rye pasta and egg pasta on renal cells by testing different concentrations ranking from 5 × 10−5 µM to 5 × 10−1 µM with or without magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) (Figure 8 and Table S3). The concentration used refers to the concentration of total phenolic content detected in the extract (Table 3). According to the content of the pasta samples reported in Table 1, for Buckwheat pasta the concentration of Indoleacetic acid was ranking from 1.85 × 10−5 µM to 1.85 × 10−1 µM, for caffeic acid derivates was ranking from 3.5 × 10−6 µM to 3.5 × 10−2 µM and for flavonoids content was ranking from 2.8 × 10−5 µM to 2.8 × 10−1 µM; for rye pasta the concentration of Indoleacetic acid was ranking from 2.2 × 10−5 µM to 2.2 × 10−1 µM, for caffeic acid derivates from 1.95 × 10−5 µM to 1.",5bffae3e-3ab5-41fa-80e3-9bf54bce7e24
20,methods20,"95 × 10−1 µM and for flavonoids species from 8.5 × 10−6 µM to 8.5 × 10−2 µM; for egg pasta the concentration of Indoleacetic acid was ranking from 4.25 × 10−5 µM to 4.25 × 10−1 µM, for flavonoids species from 7.5 × 10−6 µM to 1.85 × 10−2 µM while no caffeic acid derivatives were present.  Hydroalcoholic extract from egg pasta did not exert any significant effect on HEK-293 viability independently on the presence of oxidative stress. Extract from buckwheat pasta showed an enhancement of cell viability upon magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) treatment only at the highest concentration (28 ± 6%). Rye pasta extract alone showed a general enhancement of the cell viability for all the doses ranging from 14 ± 7% to 18 ± 1% as well as in the presence of magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) from 27 ± 3% to 13 ± 3%. The phytocomplex presented in the extracts, resulted to be more active than single standards, exerting an effect on cell viability at lower concentrations compared to the latter.",ef30bf43-f424-43fe-930d-d9cad79e5c3a
21,methods21," These results suggest that in the hydroalcoholic extracts, the major role in the rescue could be attributed to the presence of caffeic acid derivatives, observing higher rescue for rye pasta and lower/negligible effect for egg past, in which they are not detectable.  The hydroalcoholic extract were then tested on Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in the same conditions as before and the cell viability was assessed (Figure 9 and Table S4).  The hydroalcoholic extract from buckwheat and egg pasta displayed contrasting effects on cell viability: the first increases it, while the latter reduces it; no effect upon magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP) treatment was detected for both. Extract from rye pasta alone did not show any notable effect on cells viability, but it reveals a strong protective effect against magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP)-mediated oxidative stress at all the concentrations ranging from 50 ± 7% to 61 ± 21%. In standard conditions.",3b88e4bf-f6bb-4f10-9600-8c82fb29547d
22,methods22,"  In the absence of magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP), the high content of indoleacetic acid in the extract from egg pasta seems to exert a toxic effect on cell viability. Comparing the two cells models, we observed different behaviors with respect to the buckwheat and rye pasta in the absence of magnesium monoperoxyphtalate (MMPP). In particular, HEK-293 showed an increase of viability with the latter, while Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) with the former. The differences are related to the action of the phytocomplexes which are characterized by a higher content of flavonoids for the buckwheat pasta. The rescue on cell viability among samples, as observed for both cell lines, corresponds to the increase content of caffeic acid derivatives in rye pasta.",9bc91c08-78a3-43fa-ba59-ac8dd2be38cc
23,methods23,"  The study of the interaction between polyphenols containing phytocomplexes and renal cells, could help to investigate the known important effects on renal physiology exerted by those compounds [76], focusing on one of possible vehicle, pasta, typically associated with renal healthy diet. As a general rule, the metabolites of polyphenols have a plasma half-life of a few hours and are rapidly eliminated by the kidney and by the liver: the urinary and the biliary excretion route. The total amount of polyphenol metabolites excreted in urine is correlated not only with their maximum plasma concentration but also with their ability to be excreted by biliary rather than urinary tract. For example, urinary excretion of quercetin and its glycosides accounts for 0.3–1.4% of the ingested dose [77]; for caffeic acid and for ferulic acids accounts for 5.9% and 27% respectively. Therefore, pasta-derived polyphenols can have a positive impact on renal cells depending on their amount and metabolism.",66a3e23a-c166-4076-8647-2faba213fa41
24,methods24," Further studies are needed to better define their contribution to kidney health.  4. Conclusions  The consumption of pasta is nowadays so diffused and accessible that this food could be one of the most common carriers for important metabolites, such as carotenoids and polyphenols that have been associated to general health and to protective mechanisms for kidney. In this study, we assessed the positive effects of bioactive compounds by comparing different type of pasta, highlighting how it represents an unconventional source of them. The comparison of the different cell responses between single molecules and extracts suggests considering the exerted activity as derived from the whole phytocomplex whit the presence of carotenoids such as lutein and polyphenols such as indoleacetic acid, respect to the individual species and the consequential attention to the raw materials.",6c5a4912-4879-4864-9be3-78bc16486062
25,methods25," The scope of this study was (1) to strengthen the role of pasta as a food for the promotion of renal health in the healthy population and (2) for it to be a starting point for the improvement of the micronutrient profile in aproteic pastas. The results of this study suggest that the antioxidant species present in pasta play a major role in the protection of kidney cells from oxidative stress and reinforces the healthy role of quality organic pasta in the Mediterranean diet. High oxidative stress characterizes Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and an anti-oxidant compounds can be beneficial to counteract it.  Even though the WHO and the FDA consider pasta as the most adequate food for fortification, in agreement with the very definition of fortified food (which is supplementing food with what is deficient in the population), we believe that pasta fortification is necessary only for special medical purpose, including protein-free pasta for Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.",79ed9fc1-fb12-453e-be76-df966f40a6ea
26,methods26," For these patients, the micronutrient deficit in protein-free food and the necessary dietary restrictions to which they are subjected could generate nutritional deficiencies. In all the other cases, pasta fortification may not be necessary since pasta is naturally rich in complex carbohydrates and protein and low in fat and is therefore an already highly nutritious food by itself, especially if it is whole wheat based. Our study was meant to be an explorative preliminary study aimed at evaluating the possible beneficial effect that the polyphenolic components present in pasta could elicit on renal cells.
