0,background0,"The Mediterranean diet describes the traditional diet of Mediterranean regions such as Crete, other parts of Greece and Southern Italy [1–3]. The diet is typically high in the consumption of cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes and olive oil, low in red meats, and moderate in the consumption of fermented dairy products, fish, poultry and wine [2, 4]. Since its recognition, adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been reported to be associated with lower incidence of non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD)), cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and mortality [5–9]. Results from two randomised controlled trials also demonstrated the causal protective role of the diet in high-risk populations [8–11].  Although studies on the potential cardiovascular benefits of the Mediterranean diet have been published in both Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean cohorts, evidence from non-Mediterranean regions is less consistent.",2386164f-e57b-4143-b816-0df8be2ed57c
1,background1," A Swedish cohort, for example, observed that high adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality only among women [12], while in an Australian cohort, the association was observed only among men [13]. An Eastern European study also showed that high adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with lower all cause and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) mortality, but not with ischaemic heart disease (ischaemic heart disease (IHD)) or stroke mortality [14]. In the United Kingdom (UK), although the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends a Mediterranean style diet for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), no study in the country has examined the association of adherence to the Mediterranean diet with incident cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [15].",c70a90ff-3441-4e2b-b004-1b3d68cba871
2,background2,"  Moreover, in assessing adherence to the Mediterranean diet, published studies evaluated different Mediterranean diet scores (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s) [16–21], but there is sparse evidence on whether or not each algorithm would be useful in non-Mediterranean countries. In addition, most published Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s did not take into account the current recommendations for adopting the Mediterranean diet [22]. Finally, the population impact of a cardiovascular benefit from adhering to the Mediterranean diet at the general population level also remains unknown, partly because the previous trials may have limited generalisability by recruiting highly selected adults only.",1f15a733-fb2d-4ac7-985d-2cf0739d4ced
3,background3,"  Therefore, we aimed to assess the association of the Mediterranean diet as defined by different Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s with incident cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cardiovascular diseases (CVD) mortality and all-cause mortality in a UK-based cohort, and to estimate the population attributable fraction (population attributable fraction (PAF)) for cardiovascular and mortality outcomes for low adherence to the Mediterranean diet.

Details of the study design were described previously [23]. Briefly, 25,639 men and women aged 40–79 in eastern England were recruited through general practice registers and underwent baseline assessment between 1993 and 1997. Participants were further invited to the follow-up assessment (1998 to 2000), and were followed up by 2009 for incident outcomes and by 2013 for mortality. At the baseline and follow-up visits, the participants were asked to complete a health and lifestyle questionnaire and a food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)). We excluded 644 participants who did not complete any food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s.",6cfba96a-9b70-4c0f-9ea9-1d7b19d7e961
5,methods1," In the analysis for incident cardiovascular diseases (CVD), we additionally excluded 1093 participants who reported myocardial infarction (n = 790) or stroke (n = 303) at baseline. This study thus evaluated 23,902 participants (n = 11,258 with dietary data at both baseline and follow-up, and n = 208 with dietary data at follow-up only). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Norwich District Ethics Committee and participants gave informed consent.  Dietary assessment and Mediterranean diet scores (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s) Habitual diet was assessed using a 130-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) which asked about participants’ average intake of the food items over the past year.",8bbebb24-b58e-47c5-91ed-34088be1e01a
6,methods2," Validity of this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for major foods and nutrients was previously assessed against 16-day weighted dietary records, 24-hour recall and selected biomarkers in the sub-sample of European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk [24–26]. Reproducibility of the assessment of dietary components typical of the Mediterranean diet and the Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s were evaluated in this study. For Mediterranean diet score (MDS) calculation, we evaluated dietary intakes adjusted to a 2000 kcal/day (8.37 MJ/day) diet using the residual method to assess diet quality independent of diet quantity, and to partly reduce measurement errors because energy intake is partly related to under- or over-reporting of dietary consumption [27].  In this study, we evaluated four Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s as measures of adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The algorithm for each is summarised in Additional file 1: Text S1 and Table S1.",e55c46db-fbe4-46d4-b691-b348f4eefcb8
7,methods3," As the primary exposure, we evaluated a Mediterranean diet score (MDS) based on the Mediterranean diet pyramid (pyramid-based Mediterranean diet score (MDS), PyrMediterranean diet score (MDS)). The pyramid was recently proposed by the Mediterranean Diet Foundation [4] to be applied to both Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean regions, with dietary guidelines accounting for the traditional Mediterranean diet and also the contemporary food environment [4]. We newly developed the algorithm to calculate the PyrMediterranean diet score (MDS) (Additional file 1: Table S2). The other three Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s were identified through our systematic search for quantitative review articles published by January 12, 2016, on the Mediterranean diet and non-communicable diseases. We identified 254 unique records and retrieved 31 full-text articles. An algorithm for one Mediterranean diet score (MDS) was recently developed by Sofi et al.",54f85f1e-4e9d-4c10-a2cd-519f9468148c
8,methods4," [5] from their review of published literature on the Mediterranean diet (literature-based Mediterranean diet score (MDS), LitMediterranean diet score (MDS)). Whereas PyrMediterranean diet score (MDS) and LitMediterranean diet score (MDS) account for absolute levels of dietary consumption, the other two Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s [17, 28], the most commonly used Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s in the literature, assigned component scores based on cohort medians (mMediterranean diet score (MDS)) or tertiles of dietary consumption (tMediterranean diet score (MDS)) (Additional file 1: Text S1 and Table S1).  Outcome ascertainment The primary outcome was incident cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which included any first ever case of both non-fatal or fatal events due to ischaemic heart disease (IHD), ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, or other cardiovascular outcomes described by the relevant ICD codes (ICD9 401–448 or ICD10 I10–I79) [29].",fba1c1d3-10c9-484b-ba1e-97126af9a41c
9,methods5," Cause-specific hospital admission was determined using East Norfolk Commission Record of the National Health Service [29, 30]. Incident cardiovascular diseases (CVD) was ascertained until March 31, 2009. cardiovascular diseases (CVD) mortality and all-cause mortality, treated as a secondary outcome in this study, was confirmed via death certificates with ICD codes held at the UK Office for National Statistics and ascertained until June 30, 2013 [29, 30].  Assessment of other covariates Demographic, lifestyle and health characteristics were assessed at baseline and follow-up using a self-administered questionnaire. Physical activity levels were self-reported and characterised as a validated 4-point index [31]. Trained nurses measured each participant’s weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) at each visit, and took non-fasting bloods from which blood lipids were assayed.",cc846a19-74ba-4e07-8649-d58327701f18
10,methods6,"  Statistical analyses Linear regression was used for descriptive analyses of associations between the Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s and cohort baseline characteristics. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were assessed to examine reproducibility over time for Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s and relevant dietary factors. In longitudinal analysis, repeated measures of diet and covariates were used, wherever possible, through the cumulative-average method [27]. We modelled Cox proportional-hazards regression to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for each of the selected outcomes. The underlying time variable was age from the first available food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to age at diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (or death for mortality outcomes), or the date of administrative censoring, whichever occurred first.",ad15320d-c0b8-4613-9811-ec4830fcf8cd
11,methods7," Each of the four Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s was modelled continuously per standard deviation (SD) and categorically (three groups: low, medium or high adherence) with approximately equal numbers of participants in each group. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders, and additionally for potential physiological mediators. Variables considered as potential confounders were age, sex, education level, social class, marital status, smoking, physical activity, season of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) assessment, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), waist circumference, prevalent diabetes, medication use (anti-hypertensive drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, and hormone replacement therapy for women), and family history of diseases (diabetes, myocardial infarction and stroke). Potential mediators included total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, log triglycerides, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.",539740aa-e634-4670-9266-052aa6fedcc8
12,methods8," The proportional hazard assumption for Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s was not rejected on the basis of Schoenfeld residuals in multivariable-adjusted Cox model. We performed additional analyses modelling two Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s simultaneously to test if one of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s was more strongly associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) than the other. Missing covariates were observed in ≤ 3.9 % of participants for socioeconomic and lifestyle variables (3.9 % for social class and < 1.4 % for the others), and in ≤ 9.6 % of participants for physiological markers (9.6 % for blood lipids, 0.2 % for blood pressure or anthropometry). The missing information was imputed simultaneously by conducting regression-based multiple imputation (n = 10). In all analyses unless specified, estimates from 10 datasets were pooled under Rubin’s rules [32].",230b346e-57fa-4dd5-8838-e235c472428e
13,methods9,"  We estimated population attributable fraction (PAF)s for each outcome attributable to low Mediterranean diet adherence, for which we assumed the observed associations were causal. Results based on PyrMediterranean diet score (MDS) are presented in this report accounting for its strongest public-health importance based on the longitudinal analyses. We calculated population attributable fraction (PAF) based on the formula of rate difference [33]: population attributable fraction (PAF) = (I0 − Ii)/I0, equivalent to I0 − HR × dMediterranean diet score (MDS)/I0, where HR was estimated continuously with adjustment for potential confounders as aforementioned, I0 is observed incidence per 10,000 person-years, and Ii represents a hypothetical, ideal incidence if the population achieved high Mediterranean diet score (MDS) (95th percentile) (dMediterranean diet score (MDS) = Mediterranean diet score (MDS)ideal – Mediterranean diet score (MDS)observed).",56ff284d-1e55-4bd9-a291-6bd238dd4243

In addition, we repeated estimation of population attributable fraction (PAF)s in a high-risk population only. A high risk was defined as having a 10-year cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk of 10 % or higher based on QRISK2 [35], by which a clinical intervention is recommended in the UK [36].  In analysis of any dietary scores, an observed association with a health outcome can be driven by one component of the score. To rule out this possibility and assess importance of combining multiple dietary components, we repeated the primary analysis for each Mediterranean diet score (MDS) after sequentially excluding each Mediterranean diet component from the total score.",041ce7a2-d43e-43b7-a1f5-eebe861d10f6

We also repeated analyses by re-constructing Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s by grouping food items differently to consider variations of the Mediterranean diet [2, 4], for example by including only wine in the alcohol component. To assess whether the association of Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s with outcomes was independent of baseline risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD)s, we also additionally adjusted for QRISK2 as a covariate.

Comparison with other studies The modest degree of inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cardiovascular diseases (CVD) mortality, and all-cause mortality observed in European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk is broadly in line with other published studies on the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [11, 14, 38–44].",c7acf831-ce89-43f8-bbd4-bc3a55578ff1
29,discussion2," Specifically in the UK context, the Whitehall II study (n = 7731) concluded potential cardio-metabolic benefits of a Mediterranean-like diet for British adults, but did not find any significant associations after adjustment for confounders and did not assess the Mediterranean diet per se, by inferring the diet based on data-driven cluster analysis [45]. A few other studies in non-Mediterranean countries examined the association of pre-defined Mediterranean diet with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [12–14, 41–43, 46]. While their findings were broadly consistent with our findings, estimates of associations were often imprecise with wide confidence intervals or were non-significant. Exceptionally, one recent US study based on a large multi-ethnic cohort (n = 215,782) found that mMediterranean diet score (MDS) was associated with 11 to 28 % lower cardiovascular diseases (CVD) mortality [43].",3258d682-1224-497d-81fd-8ab1af874833
30,discussion3," Based on our findings evaluating different Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s, the inverse association could be stronger, if the study evaluated the other Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s better suited to a non-Mediterranean population than mMediterranean diet score (MDS). However, compared to studies conducted in Mediterranean cohorts [40, 47, 48], our estimates appear modest, which could be reflective of the fact that high adherence to a Mediterranean diet in this UK cohort might still not be fully representative of a traditional Mediterranean diet, as might be observed in the Mediterranean regions.  population attributable fraction (PAF) was not estimated from any prior prospective studies, but can be manually calculated in the PREDIMED trial for incidence of either ischaemic heart disease (IHD) or stroke [11]. The control group of this high-risk trial in Spain had an incidence of the composite outcome of 11.2 per 1000 person-years, similar to the incidence of our overall cohort (12.",39015c4c-35aa-4170-a7b8-6a0f2f5feacc

According to effect estimates reported in the publication, the population attributable fraction (PAF) for the outcome for no intervention in the PREDIMED trial was estimated to be 27.8 %, whereas population attributable fraction (PAF) in the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort for suboptimal adherence to PyrMediterranean diet score (MDS) was 8.5 %. The corresponding number of cases preventable and the number needed to treat over 10 years of follow-up were estimated to be 28.5 per 1000 population and 35.1, respectively, in PREDIMED and 9.2 per 1000 and 108.9, respectively, in European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk.",3dfbe5aa-077f-4bb2-8d02-4b9861d2db1f
32,discussion5,"  One possible explanation for this discrepancy in these measures between PREDIMED and European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk could be bias toward the null in the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort, because of measurement errors and temporal changes in diet. Moreover, despite the inverse association with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) incidence, the variability of adherence to the Mediterranean diet might not fully capture a high-quality diet in the UK. Indeed, none of the participants recorded the optimal score of PyrMediterranean diet score (MDS) (the observed highest = 13.1; the possible highest = 15.0). Alternatively, as mentioned above, the difference could reflect that the PREDIMED trial compared the Mediterranean diet against a non-Mediterranean diet, whereas European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk tested a diet not fully in line with the Mediterranean diet.",b401bdcf-2a00-43a4-ae18-28c4a5fb4083
33,discussion6,"  Interpretation of results and implications Evidence from the Lyon Diet Heart Study in France and the more recent PREDIMED trial in Spain supports the causal effect of adherence to the Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular diseases (CVD) outcomes [10, 11, 49, 50]. The population attributable fraction (PAF) estimates in European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk suggest that 1 to 6 % of all cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and 2 to 14 % of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) or stroke incidence could be avoided by adhering to the Mediterranean diet in both a general population and a high-risk population, defined by QRISK2, for whom statin prescription would be recommended in the UK [36]. Of note, statin treatment could prevent 24 % of new-onset cardiovascular diseases (CVD), according to trials in the UK [51].",514ee9c0-cdaa-4026-abe9-2386d2e11152
34,discussion7," However, while statins do not influence other outcomes or may even increase risk of diabetes [52], greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet by contrast may have benefits beyond prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Our estimates are comparable to the corresponding population attributable fraction (PAF) estimates for physical inactivity, which were 5.8 % for ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality and 9.4 % for all-cause mortality [53].  While an alternative healthy dietary pattern beyond the Mediterranean diet may exist due to cultural differences, our population attributable fraction (PAF) estimates indicate that the Mediterranean diet should be one option for a healthy diet in the UK, where cardiovascular diseases (CVD) accounts for approximately 155,000 deaths, or more than a quarter of all deaths each year, and associated healthcare costs are estimated to be £11 billion per year and increasing [54].",87f739c1-ea75-4112-96ed-bf0cdb69d624
35,discussion8," If we assume causality and generalizability of our findings to the general UK population, a population attributable fraction (PAF) of 12.5 % would have equated to 19,375 cases of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) deaths preventable each year. Further investigation is warranted to explore the effectiveness of a population-level recommendation and cost-effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet in the UK and other non-Mediterranean countries, as a component of lifestyle recommendations for both the general and high cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk populations.  The use of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) as the dietary assessment instrument in our study limits the ability to precisely measure adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as it did not differentiate between extra virgin olive oil and other olive oils or between tree nuts (legumes) and peanuts, as evaluated in the PREDIMED trial [4].",3aa02e50-41dd-407d-8f48-1eb101bc2baf
36,discussion9," Nonetheless, this study indicates utility of three scoring algorithms for the Mediterranean diet score (MDS): PyrMediterranean diet score (MDS), LitMediterranean diet score (MDS) and tMediterranean diet score (MDS), to represent adherence to a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern in epidemiological settings. Of note, findings are similar upon alternative categorisations of food groups for the Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s, and upon other sensitivity analyses (Additional file 1: Table S7). Our findings indicate that using sex-specific medians (mMediterranean diet score (MDS)) in a given population would be too crude and not sensitive enough to assess adherence to the diet in a non-Mediterranean country. On the other hand, PyrMediterranean diet score (MDS) and LitMediterranean diet score (MDS) may deserve future investigation for clinical application, as they allowed calculation of Mediterranean diet score (MDS) without use of reference population levels (e.g. medians or tertiles) [5].",cf9e8c0a-d44c-44cb-a89b-ac0a06625b26
37,discussion10," PyrMediterranean diet score (MDS) is likely to be better than the others because the scoring accounts for the continuous property of dietary consumption, for the contemporary food environment distinguishing between processed and unprocessed meat, and for available evidence from epidemiological studies by encouraging moderate consumption of fermented dairy products, as originally characterised by the Mediterranean diet [2, 55, 56]; of note, dairy consumption was considered as an adverse component in mMediterranean diet score (MDS) and tMediterranean diet score (MDS). Our findings guide further studies to investigate the utility of the Mediterranean dietary pyramid (and PyrMediterranean diet score (MDS)) for clinical practice and public health promotion in both Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean populations.",0f3b6969-0ed0-4938-ad9d-4890454381e5
38,discussion11,"  Strengths and limitations These results are of interest as the first to extensively examine the association of the Mediterranean diet with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the UK and estimate the population impact of increasing adherence. Evaluation of four different Mediterranean diet score (MDS)s clarified the difference between their characteristics and their utility in a non-Mediterranean context. A strength of this study is that it included a large sample size with long follow-up time. Because outcome ascertainment in this cohort was externally linked to medical records, it also minimised bias that could arise during follow-up. As limitations, measurement errors were present in our self-reported dietary and covariate measurements, and we could not fully account for changes in diet throughout the study period, although the errors were reduced by using repeated measures of diet, as well as time-varying covariates [27, 46].",7df6ba9a-e841-4002-935e-b6e662705e01
39,discussion12," We considered body mass index (BMI) as a confounder in our analyses, although recent evidence suggests potential mediating effects of body mass index (BMI) in the diet cardiovascular diseases (CVD) association [57], and this could lead to underestimation of our effect estimates. However, this is unlikely given the consistency of our estimates across the levels of adjustment. Residual confounding is possible, because of unmeasured confounders and imprecise measurement of potential confounders. Generalisability is limited because of potential healthy cohort bias [23], dietary measures collected more than 15 years ago, and inclusion of largely white European individuals in the UK.  Conclusions We observed a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet in this UK cohort. Our study also informs potential population impact of increasing adherence to the Mediterranean diet in a UK population.",e9eea8f3-5f66-4268-9b95-512b4d618121
40,discussion13," These results add to the pool of evidence on the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, even in a non-Mediterranean country where an optimal dietary pattern is unknown. Our findings stimulate future population-based and clinical investigations into the efficacy and effectiveness of adhering to the Mediterranean diet in contemporary, non-Mediterranean populations.
