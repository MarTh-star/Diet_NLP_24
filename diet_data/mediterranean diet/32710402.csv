0,introduction0," Chronic diseases are one of the main challenges for health systems. These diseases account for a high proportion of morbidity and mortality worldwide [1]. The cost of these diseases, when they are considered alone, has a relevant impact but it is even higher when comorbidities are present [2]. It is estimated that 10 million deaths attributed to chronic diseases can be prevented by adopting healthy behaviours while not adopting them has a significant economic impact [3, 4]. Against this background, the primary health care (primary health care (PHC)) system offers comprehensive, continuous care as the optimal context for the promotion of healthy lifestyles [5]. Health promotion does not have to be focused on specific health risk, but it can address several of them together.",bcc9e41b-1598-43c9-825e-6c453d51b3eb
1,introduction1," In this context, multiple health behaviour changes (Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC)) interventions approach several risk factors within the same intervention [6], which might increase their efficiency and effectiveness.  However, as far as we know, few economic evaluations have assessed the impact of Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC) interventions [7]. McRobbie et al showed that a diet and physical activity intervention addressing weight management in obese patients had an incremental cost-utility ratio (incremental cost utility ratios (ICUR)) of £7400 per quality-adjusted life-year (quality adjusted life year (QALY)) gained using a health system perspective [7], while van Keulen et al showed that a tailored print intervention aiming to improve physical activity and/or diet in adults between 45 and 70 years cost €2867 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and €160 per improved behaviour [8].",78b75384-fcfc-41cd-a4d7-eb0ceea6da29
2,introduction2," Similar evidence is available on the assessment of single behaviour interventions. Systematic reviews focused on cardiovascular risk (cardiovascular risk (CVR)) or physical activity did not find a great number of economic evaluations based on randomized clinical trials [9, 10]. Indeed, some authors have pointed out that more robust, real-world evidence focused on Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC) intervention is needed, especially in light of the resource requirements to implement them [9].  The EIRA study contained an Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC) intervention focused on smoking cessation, physical activity and adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern in primary health care (PHC) patients [11]. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness, in terms of Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC) and cardiovascular risk (CVR) reduction, of the EIRA intervention through a cluster-randomized controlled trial.

4,methods0," This was an economic evaluation alongside a 12-month cluster-randomized control trial conducted between 2017 and 2018 in 25 primary health care (PHC) centres from seven Spanish regions. The cost perspectives taken were societal and healthcare providers. The study protocol (NCT03136211.R), with details on the study design and intervention, was published elsewhere [11].  Setting  The Spanish public healthcare system provides universal coverage for citizens and foreign nationals. It is funded through taxes and free of charge at the point of use, with some exceptions such as medication. Although it is a decentralised system, where each of the 17 Spanish regions controls health planning, public health and the management of health services (including tariffs publication), primary health care (PHC) is the most accessible point of contact within the public system [12].",97f69d72-bc97-4b51-a232-52482bcfc802

Randomisation  Twenty-six primary health care (PHC) centres were computer randomized 1:1 based on each region at a central location (IDIAP Jordi Gol, Barcelona, Spain). After randomisation, one intervention centre dropped out due to administrative reasons, leaving 12 centres in the intervention group. Participants were assigned to the intervention or control group based on their primary health care (PHC) centre.  Interventions  EIRA was a health promotion intervention designed following Medical Research Council methodology [13] (including systematic reviews [14–22], citizen and professional participation through qualitative research [23–25] and a previous pilot study, among other techniques) and was based on the Transtheoretical Model [26].",dcd3af1a-a2fd-4122-9108-857169181b09
7,methods3," Physicians and nurses applied the intervention in their routine practice in the primary health care (PHC) centre. It consisted of a first screening visit where the primary health care (PHC) professionals assessed the potential risk behaviours. Subsequently, the primary health care (PHC) professionals advised the participant, reached an agreement with them on achievable goals, developed a specific plan taking the three potential risks and stage of change into account, assisted with anticipation of barriers and arranged follow-up support (i.e., 2–3 visits). The duration of the intervention was 12 months and it combined three action levels (i.e., individual, group and community).

As described in Supplementary Table, information on healthcare utilisation and sick leave were collected from electronic health records, individual clinical record review and/or a Case Report Form (Case Report Form (CRF)) depending on the region.

Subsequently, the mean tariff was calculated for each health service. A social worker visit tariff was not found, and it was assumed to be the same as that of the Nurse centre visit. Medication cost was obtained from administrative databases. The cost of productivity loss was calculated based on the human capital approach using the minimum daily wage in Spain.

25,discussion0," Summary  The cost-effectiveness of the EIRA intervention measured in terms of Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC) remains unclear. However, although the intervention was shown to be no more costly than usual care and it promoted Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC), the probabilistic analysis showed high uncertainty surrounding cost differences and intervention did not affect quality of life or cardiovascular risk reduction. Based on the results of this economic evaluation, the EIRA intervention should be reformulated before being translated to clinical practice or it should be assessed with a longer follow-up period.  Strengths and limitations  The large, representative sample is the main strength of this study. This was a multisite study evaluating an Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC) intervention implemented in a complex context such as primary health care (PHC).",c0a8eb61-6861-46bf-82dc-657d10bfee65
26,discussion1," Participants from 25 primary health care (PHC) centres in 7 Spanish regions were included and this represents one of the first economic evaluations that has been developed under these circumstances. The pragmatism of this trial is one of the key points of its design as it was developed with the aim of an immediate implementation in the primary health care (PHC) system throughout the modification and elimination of potential barriers. We intended to develop a flexible intervention that could be adapted to different primary health care (PHC) settings, and the intervention’s design was based on the results of previous phases of the study. These features led to adherence being measured in a permissive way and the content of the intervention itself in each of the centres was not fully documented. This fact together with a low fidelity of the intervention could have limited our capacity to detect differences between groups [38].",3ce5fd47-8233-4583-aff6-d665d049316a
27,discussion2," Similarly, not all cost information was gathered using the same protocols (each region has combined electronic health record download, individual clinical record review and/or Case Report Form (CRF) based on availability) and this may introduce some bias. However, it increased the external validity of the results of the study. The follow-up period may have limited the impact of the intervention in outcomes such as quality adjusted life year (QALY)s and cardiovascular risk (CVR) reduction considering that intervention is focused on health promotion.  Comparison with existing literature  There were no differences in costs between groups. As suggested previously, health promotion interventions have a very low cost or, at least, a similar cost compared to usual care [7, 8, 39–41]. Similarly, the intervention had no effect on quality adjusted life year (QALY)s at one-year follow-up.",69740582-c6e7-42e1-81e4-8c5ab8912304
28,discussion3," Although quality adjusted life year (QALY)s are the standard effect measure in cost-utility analysis, health promotion interventions are not expected to produce improvements in quality adjusted life year (QALY)s in the short term. Similar results have been observed in economic evaluations of health promotion interventions in primary health care (PHC) [7, 8, 39–42]. However, some of these studies showed positive incremental cost utility ratios (ICUR)s with a clear dominance of the intervention [7, 40]. Although the effect of these interventions was small (0.01 for quality adjusted life year (QALY)S and 80£ for costs [7] or 0.02 for quality adjusted life year (QALY)S and €-16 for cost [40]), the uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness of the intervention was also small.",e46de503-4f27-450b-8de9-a746a9cc0f5f
29,discussion4," The incremental cost utility ratios (ICUR) dominance in some of these preventive interventions could be related to the targeted population (obese) [7] or the risk approached (major depression) [40] while the EIRA intervention is focused on health behaviours in a general population sample where differences in quality adjusted life year (QALY)s after 1 year is hardly seen.  Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC) was more sensitive to the intervention in the short term. The EIRA intervention presented statistical differences in this outcome and showed a societal incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) of €5600 per one extra patient changing two or three unhealthy behaviours. This incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) was reduced to €3900 when the healthcare perspective was considered. Previous studies showed lower incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER)s, up to £986 (€1098 at November 2020), per one extra patient behaviour change [8, 10].",69db6b1d-770e-421b-bf4e-9872b37f4729
30,discussion5," However, most of these interventions only focus on one behaviour. Although previous authors have suggested proposals of transforming unit changes of different outcomes into comparable metrics, currently, there is no national or international threshold in terms of behaviour change to consider an intervention efficient. In any case, the EIRA intervention would seem to exceed this virtual threshold; especially when the national threshold to consider an intervention efficient in terms of quality adjusted life year (QALY)s is €20,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY)s [43] and given the difficulty in translating healthy behaviours into gains in quality adjusted life year (QALY)s [44]. A suggested alternative to thresholds is the Relative Value Index, being the formula for this index: Relative Value Index (RVI) = (usual care mean costs/usual care mean effects)/incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER))) [45].",5268c5cb-a33f-4e8e-a16a-0312b4688e9a
31,discussion6," A Relative Value Index greater than 1 means that a new intervention would provide better outcomes at a lower incremental cost per outcome than the comparator. However, values below 1 and close to 0, as EIRA intervention shows (taking into account mean cost and effects, in terms of Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC), in the usual care group) would mean that the additional outcome associated with the new intervention would cost more than the previously “accepted value” of a cost per outcome.  Partially similar results were observed when cardiovascular risk (CVR) was considered as the outcome. The EIRA intervention showed a societal incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) of €6900 per one-point reduction in cardiovascular risk (CVR) and a healthcare incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) of 4900.",fc840d27-ae54-4202-b556-4be63c9b44a5
32,discussion7," In this situation, and considering that usual care already involves preventive protocols, it is very difficult to observe substantial changes in these outcomes, and consequently, cardiovascular risk (CVR) in the short-medium term. Furthermore, changes in the medium-long term can be preceded by promotion interventions on healthy lifestyles which have an impact on cardiovascular risk (CVR) [46].  The largest effect in cardiovascular risk (CVR) and Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC) was observed in the complete-case analysis; this might suggest that higher levels of intervention fidelity would have produced better results. However, this effect is still clearly lower than previous preventive primary health care (PHC) interventions aiming to reduce cardiovascular risk (CVR) [47], other related outcomes such as weight [7], or behaviour change [8, 10].  A technical but crucial issue is the model and assumption choice.",50299deb-9241-49c6-95b5-451e070399d5
33,discussion8," In this paper, we considered generalized linear models as the main choice due to previous recommendations related to checking non-normality distribution in cost and effects after a visual inspection [37]. However, it is important to emphasise that seemingly unrelated regression, a choice that led to correlate the error terms across regression models in cost and effects but assuming normality, was the second most favourable scenario to the intervention in terms of cost-utility.  Implication for research and practice  In a globalized world, it is increasingly important to develop complex healthcare actions that can be adapted to each patient and implemented in a large number of settings. At this point, developing hybrid trials is a very good option. This is particularly important in the context of primary health care (PHC) where systemic interventions predominate and professionals approach more than one health or risk behaviour.",b618a243-8fe2-441c-82d3-f2a42c0f863d
34,discussion9," However, researchers should not overlook the importance of monitoring the specific actions in each setting. This would ensure that clear information is available to determine whether these actions are genuinely (cost)effective or not.  Developing cost-effective interventions that promote healthy lifestyles are crucial to support the healthcare system. A healthy population should be an optimal target for these interventions although, due to patient health status, intervention assessment needs to be extended into the medium-long term. Conducting economic models which assess the long-term cost-effectiveness using mortality and quality adjusted life year (QALY)S as outcomes would give relevant information for health decision-makers. Similarly, standardizing the use of other generalizable outcomes that could be sensitive to health promotion interventions would help decision making in this field.",c26b50d1-aa9a-4610-93b6-58331b153575
35,discussion10," A healthy population is usually located in very heterogeneous and complex contexts, a fact that complicated the registry and cost definition, key factors for economic evaluations. In this line, efforts should be taken in standardization without leaving the complexity of the context out of consideration [48].  Conclusions  A health promotion primary health care (PHC) intervention such as EIRA effectively impact Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC) in the Spanish context but its efficiency cannot be fully established under current circumstances. The recommendation of this intervention should be conditioned by positive results in the medium-long term clinical assessment or by modification of the intervention.
