0,methods0,"To define the MedDiet a literature review was performed. Databases PubMed [49], MEDLINE [50], Science Direct [51], Academic Search Premier [52] and the University of South Australia Library Catalogue [53] were searched using the following search terms; “Mediterranean diet”, “Mediterranean dietary pattern”, Mediterranean, and content, nutrient *, “nutrient content”, definition, define *, pyramid, and “number of serve *”, flavonoid *. Definitions were classified into one of four categories for the purpose of this review: (1) general descriptive definitions; (2) diet pyramids/numbers of servings of key foods and serving size; (3) grams of key foods/food groups; and (4) nutrient and flavonoid content. Total intakes of other phytochemicals, including total polyphenols, phytosterols and carotenoids, were reported by n < 2 papers which was deemed insufficient information to draw conclusions from.",c8343e48-1255-43ee-a4ee-b5ef3cef7862
1,methods1," Papers were included in the review if they defined the MedDiet in at least two of the above four ways. This included studies reporting the dietary intake of a Mediterranean population in an observational capacity, presenting a Mediterranean menu designed based on evidence, or studies using a Mediterranean diet as an intervention where the grams of foods and/or nutrient content was reported. All studies were published in English. There was no restriction on study design, date of publication or sample characteristics. MedDiets used for weight loss purpose were excluded due to caloric and food restrictions. Studies reporting less than five nutrients or food group quantities were excluded. Where the same Mediterranean diet scores (MDS) had been applied using identical cut-off values in separate articles, only the original paper was included.  To define the diet by quantity of foods in grams or milllitres, the mean intake was recorded for major foods or food groups.",aa4008a2-859f-4238-953f-9e283a71b0e7
2,methods2," Twelve groups were included (bread, all cereals, legumes, potatoes, all vegetables, fruits/nuts, meat/meat products, cheese, all dairy, eggs, olive oil and fish), based on available data. For the all cereals, all vegetables and all dairy groups, if not originally reported the sum of individual components was used; for all cereals, bread and cereals were combined, for all vegetables, potatoes and other vegetables were combined and for all dairy, cheese, yoghurt and milk were combined. Using standard Australian serving sizes [30] the gram value was converted to numbers of serves to provide a defining range or number of servings for key food groups.",7e4cb314-2212-45cd-914b-7299f810a30d
3,methods3," To define the diet by nutrient intake, the mean of all studies reporting at least five of the following was calculated; energy, total fat, saturated fat (SFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA), protein, percentage energy contributions from total fat, saturated fat (SFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA), PUFA, protein, carbohydrate, monounsaturated fat (MUFA):saturated fat (SFA), fibre, vitamin C, folate and potassium. The percentage energy contributions of macronutrients and the monounsaturated fat (MUFA) to saturated fat (SFA) ratio were calculated based on total gram value where not originally reported.  5. Conclusions High level evidence from the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) [15] study shows the MedDiet can improve cardiovascular and cognitive health, which will help guide dietary guideline development for prevention of chronic disease.",824bd2bf-17ba-4eb4-b515-d8ddb492f9c1
4,methods4," To help understand the mechanisms of benefit of the MedDiet, we require a definition of the MedDiet which is consistent and describes not only the principles generally, but the nutrient and bioactive content. This is the first review to collate information from across a wide range of different studies, to summarise the general descriptions, servings of foods, grams of key food groups and nutrient and flavonoid content of the MedDiet. The average nutrient content of the diet resulting from this review was relatively consistent amongst different studies. This may be a useful working definition, and could improve a priori scoring systems which currently rely on grams of foods rather than nutrient content. Consideration for the geographical location of data collection, sample size, and methodological aspects was beyond the scope of this review, but may be necessary to improve the definition.",fa5de812-7821-48e8-92c0-570eaad795f0
5,methods5," Examining additional foods, nutrients and bioactive compounds and including an assessment of methodological quality of studies could improve this definition further. ",2506b188-c5ce-4b5d-a80c-75ad0a712f89
