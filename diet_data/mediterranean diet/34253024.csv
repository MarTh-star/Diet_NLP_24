0,methods0," Data source  The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was a nationwide, cross-sectional survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)). The survey included demographic, socioeconomic, dietary and health-related questions and assessed medical, dental, and physiological parameters. Laboratory tests were evaluated by appropriately trained medical personnel. Further details regarding the data collection process and analytical guidelines are available on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) website (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm). All studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the National Public Health Institute. Written informed consent to participate in this study was provided by the participants' legal guardian or next of kin (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/irba98.htm accessed on 09 December 2021).",cb9420dd-0d26-46ca-9476-cbb66027739c
1,methods1,"  Study population  The 2005–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) assessed for depressive symptom and dietary patterns among survey participants. Seven biennial datasets were combined for subsequent analysis. In this study, we excluded participants with missing dietary (N = 16,677) or depressive symptom (N = 32,730) data. In total, 19,477 participants aged over 20 years were eligible for study inclusion (Supplementary Figure 1).  Mediterranean diet index  Dietary intake was assessed via structured interview focused on 24-h diet recall. The first diet recall was obtained during in-person assessment at a mobile examination center (day 1) and the second over the telephone (day 2) within 10 days of the in-person assessment. For primary analyses, we used the 24-h diet recall obtained during the in-person interview (day 1 and day 2 recalls). The Mediterranean diet (MED) index was determined in two steps.",4d99bdf9-38d5-4493-a47f-7b5c2aca7dba
2,methods2," First, average 24-h diet recall data was linked to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Patterns Equivalents Database to convert foods and beverages to equivalent United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) food pattern components (23). All dietary intake data from both 24-h recalls were aggregated as an average intake over 2 days for each participant. A Mediterranean diet (MED) index was subsequently calculated using the aMediterranean diet (MED) score (4, 5). The aMediterranean diet (MED) score (total score = 18) includes nine components: vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, whole grains, red and processed meats, fish, alcohol and olive oil (5).  Depressive symptom  Depressive symptom was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a reliable and valid screening instrument composed of nine items assessing for presence and severity of clinical depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks (24).",09b1168d-3e67-47d5-bc9e-096627a0d45a
3,methods3," Each of the nine items can be scored from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”), with a total score ranging from 0 to 27. Depressive symptom was dichotomized based on a PHQ-9 score ≥10. This cutoff point, frequently used in prior studies, has been noted to have a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for detecting major depression (12, 16, 24, 25).  Potential covariates  Baseline sociodemographic data, including demographic and questionnaire data, were obtained from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).",004e80be-69e3-4580-bcbc-813920da81ab
4,methods4," These data included sex (male or female), age (continuous; National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) coded individuals over the age of 80 years as simply 80 years old), body mass index (BMI; <25, 25 to <30, ≥30), race (Hispanic, non-Hispanic), education (less than secondary and secondary, higher than secondary), marital status (married/living with a partner, widowed/divorced/separated, never married), annual income (< $75,000, ≥$75,000), health insurance (yes or no), self-reported health (excellent/very good, good, fair/poor), smoking history (yes or no) and insomnia (yes or no). Metabolic equivalent for task (Metabolic equivalent for task (MET)) was used to assess the leisure time physical activities of participants.",8dcf202c-ecb0-4148-96e2-250fc6feb5d7
5,methods5," Self-reported time spent in moderate and vigorous leisure time exercise in a typical week was multiplied by the respective assigned Metabolic equivalent for task (MET) score and values from both activities summed up to yield a total Metabolic equivalent for task (MET) in mins/week. Participants who had Metabolic equivalent for task (MET)-mins/week scores of ≥600 were classified as active while those with scores <600 were classified as inactive (16). Sedentary behavior was assessed by self-reported hours spent sitting at a desk, traveling in a car or bus, reading, playing cards, watching television, or using a computer on a typical day.  Medical record data, including data concerning hypertension, diabetes, stroke, thyroid illness, malignancy, cardiovascular diseases (CVD; including congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris and heart attack), respiratory diseases (including emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma) and PD was also collected.",e25f6f8d-4ad6-46dc-864d-85281eebcc64
6,methods6," Many patients with PD suffered depression at the time of diagnosis. To explore whether PD was a potential covariate that affected the relationship between aMediterranean diet (MED) and depressive symptom, patients suffering PD were identified amongst our participant pool (26, 27). Here, PD cases were identified if clinical history was remarkable for treatment with any of the following PD-specific medications: benztropine (generic drug code: d00175), carbidopa (generic drug code: d03473), levodopa (generic drug code: d03473), ropinirole (generic drug code: d04215), methyldopa (generic drug code: d00133), entacapone (generic drug code: d04460), and amantadine (generic drug code: d00086) (26, 27).

7,analysis0," The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)) cross-sectional checklist was considered in this study (Supplementary Table 1) (28). Continuous variables were reported as mean ± standard deviation while categorical variables were reported as frequencies or percentages. Moreover, a complex and multi-level probability sampling design was implemented for National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. As such, appropriate weighting methodology was applied in our study.",f350d37b-927a-487a-9f19-ba97b0e901cd
8,analysis1," Weighted Student's t (continuous variables included age and aMediterranean diet (MED) score) and weighted chi-square (categorical variables included race, education, marital status, annual income, health insurance, self-reported health history, smoking history and insomnia, hypertension, CVD, respiratory diseases, diabetes, stroke, thyroid illness, malignancy and PD) tests were performed to assess for significant differences among means and proportions of the two groups.  Multivariate logistic regression models were weighted and generated to evaluate the association between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom.",ac74cc2a-25eb-47fd-8a88-ab84ac7996ca
9,analysis2," Considering Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE), we simultaneously obtained results of crude (no adjustment for covariates) and model 1 (only adjustment for age and sex), 2 (adjustment for socioeconomic variables), 3 (adjustment for lifestyle- and health-related variables), 4 (adjustment for chronic medical conditions) and 5 (adjustment for all covariates) adjusted analyses (28).  To evaluate the potential non-linear relationship between exposure and outcome, a generalized additive (GAM) was generated. If a non-linear relationship was detected, a two-step linear regression model was generated to assess aMediterranean diet (MED) score threshold effect and depressive symptom based on a smoothing plot. The threshold level of the aMediterranean diet (MED) score at which the association between depressive symptom began to change and become significantly different was evaluated using a recurrence method.",f4611823-9d8c-4d65-bd51-4539bb420d46
10,analysis3," The inflection point was moved along a predefined interval with the inflection point showing maximum model likelihood investigated (29).  Random forest, a common machine learning method, was applied to analyze the contribution of various elements comprising the aMediterranean diet (MED) score to depressive symptom. The learning method only allows a random sample of predictor variables was considered at each tree split. This model derived consecutive decision trees using random samples of training data to predict the residuals of previous models, thus creating a combination of trees that weighted difficulty to predict events to a greater degree (30). Based on the Gini splitting index, the optimal number of splits for each individual tree, the total number of trees, and an additional shrinkage factor—which reweights the prediction contribution from each individual tree—were determined using 10-fold cross-validation.",b7ec3ef1-28d8-42ab-8ac5-d0319231efba
11,analysis4,"  Subgroup analysis was conducted using a stratified multivariate logistic regression model. Participants with missing data for any other covariates were excluded. All analyses were conducted using the statistical software packages R (http://www.R-project.org, The R Foundation) and EmpowerStats (http://www.empowerstats.com, X&Y Solutions, Boston, MA, USA). P-values <0.05 (two-sided) were considered significantly different.  Consent to participate  All participants in this study signed written informed consent and all research procedures were approved by the National Center for Health Statistics Research Ethics Review Board (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/irba98.htm).

12,results0," Baseline participant characteristics  In total, 19,477 participants over 20 years of age were eligible for inclusion in this study. According to PHQ-9 scoring, 16,460 participants were classified as non-depressive and 3,017 participants depressive. Baseline characteristics are list in Table 1. Depressive participant aMediterranean diet (MED) score (5.81 ± 2.11) was lower compared to that of non-depressive participants (6.22 ± 2.16) (P < 0.001). Participants who were female, Hispanic or Other, less educated, single (widowed/divorced/separated/never married), low earners, without health insurance, with a poor self-reported health status, overweight, non-smoking, inactive, with an extended period of daily sedentary behavior, as well as a history of suffering insomnia, stroke, thyroid illness, hypertension, CVD, respiratory diseases, diabetes, PD, or malignancy, were found to be more likely to suffer depression (P < 0.05).",e85eae06-5a5d-4390-af57-8737212b6877

Multiple logistic regression analyses of aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom  Multivariable logistic regression was applied to evaluate the relationship between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and the prevalence of depressive symptom (Table 2). In the crude model, the prevalence of depressive symptom and aMediterranean diet (MED) score were negatively associated (OR: 0.915, 95% CI: 0.899–0.932; P < 0.001). In the adjusted model 1 (adjusted for age, sex and race), results did not differ from those obtained using crude analysis (OR: 0.905, 95% CI: 0.888–0.922; P < 0.001). After adjusting for different covariate categories in models 2–5, a negative association between depressive symptom and aMediterranean diet (MED) score remained (Table 2).",80b8748c-bcd7-4641-9cf4-ea2589a7f1f5

Model 5 adjusted for: all covariates listed in Table 1 were adjusted.  OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval.  Analysis of non-linear relationships between aMediterranean diet (MED) scores and depressive symptom  Because aMediterranean diet (MED) score is a continuous variable, we considered that it may have a non-linear relationship with depressive symptom. Via generalized additive (GAM), we found a non-linear relationship between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom (Figure 1). Using two-step linear regression analysis, we calculated an inflection point of 3.",ba099eb5-f662-486a-a7dd-fa5930718a68
15,results7," To the left of the inflection point, effect size, 95% CI and P-values were 1.079, 0.924–1.259, and 0.337, respectively. A negative relationship, however, was also observed between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom to the right of the inflection point (0.907, 0.889–0.926, and <0.001; (Supplementary Table 2).

Red: OR; blue circles: 95% CI.  Random forest analysis of aMediterranean diet (MED) score component influence on depressive symptom  To explore which aMediterranean diet (MED) score components contributed most to the prevalence of depressive symptom, we used a random forest method for further analysis. High to low component contributions were as follows: vegetable, fruit, fish, meat, alcohol, legume, dairy, and cereal scores (Supplementary Figure 2).",b8925504-ed26-4cd1-b35a-7beab638ff94
16,results8," These results underscored a stronger association between high-fiber foods and a lower prevalence of depressive symptom.  Results of subgroup analyses  Because many factors are associated with depression, we performed a stratified analysis of populations with different characteristics to identify factors that influence the relationship between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom. As shown in Supplementary Table 3, the negative relationship between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom does not change in most characteristic populations irrespective of factors such as age, sex, race, education level, marital status, health insurance, BMI, smoking, leisure time physical activity, sedentary behavior, insomnia, stroke, thyroid illness, hypertension, CVD, respiratory diseases or malignancy (P < 0.001).",40c74c1e-8617-435d-8acd-616e362fbc84
17,results9," Interestingly, no significant associations between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom were observed among high annual income earners (P = 0.093), diabetics (P = 0.063), individuals with borderline blood glucose levels (P = 0.093), and patients suffering PD (P = 0.474).

18,discussion0," Over the past several decades, interest concerning the prevention and treatment of diseases via dietary modification has shifted from studying the effects of single nutrients and foods to studying dietary patterns (31). A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggested that dietary interventions hold promise for effectively reducing symptoms of depression (22). Adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) in particular appears to reduce manifestation of chronic illnesses and premature mortality (32). Although evidence of benefits concerning a lower prevalence of depression in the setting of proper Mediterranean diet (MED) adherence is scarce, some studies have reported such findings (10–12). Our results similarly suggest a negative association between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and the prevalence of depressive symptom.",00c5689c-0839-4784-87cf-39acd8318ce4
19,discussion1," On the basis of multivariate logistic regression analysis, we applied generalized additive (GAM) to further evaluate the non-linear association between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and the prevalence of depressive symptom. Importantly, generalized additive (GAM) can not only address non-parametric smoothing but also fit a regression spline to data, which is obviously advantageous in analysis of non-linear associations (33). Here, we noted a negative association between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and the prevalence of depressive symptom at an aMediterranean diet (MED) score of 3 points or greater. These findings suggest that individuals with depressive symptoms should ideally strive for aMediterranean diet (MED) scores of >3, thus increasing the likelihood that Mediterranean diet (MED) alleviates clinical depression.",8c33913d-dc18-46e8-b351-71606c7e6d3d
20,discussion2,"  The beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet (MED) can be mainly attributed to its numerous components rich in anti-oxidants and possessing anti-inflammatory properties (34). Positive effects in the setting of depression are likely mainly due to the activity of unsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols (2018). Moreover, our findings suggest that high-fiber food, including vegetables and fruit, plays a greater role than foods such as fish, meat, alcohol, legumes, dairy and cereals, with respect to the negative association between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom. These results demonstrate Mediterranean diet (MED) is a dietary pattern based on plant-derived foods (32). Importantly, vegetables and fruits are rich in phytochemicals, phenolic compounds and flavonoids. Most of these compounds possess significant anti-oxidant properties which likely improve depressive symptoms via inhibition of oxidative stress and alleviation of chronic inflammation.",c225de6e-c678-4e25-8717-c10ea92457d1
21,discussion3," For example, lutein, a dietary phytochemical capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, has been demonstrated to exert an antidepressant-like effect and alleviate neurochemical imbalances (35). Curcumin, a polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of the turmeric plant, has been demonstrated to exert antidepressant effects in both animal and human trials (36, 37). Similarly, S-equol, a metabolite of dietary soy isoflavones, was reported to alleviate depressive-like behavior in mice by inhibiting neuroinflammation and enhancing synaptic plasticity (38). Moreover, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may reduce inflammation and benefit mood by fostering the production of the anti-inflammatory prostaglandin E3 (as opposed to the pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2) (39).",d25ea520-ce6b-434d-89bd-1278f7650682
22,discussion4," Although vegetable and fruit scores were noted to exert a greater effect on the association between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and the prevalence of depressive symptom, other ingredients also contribute to the relationship. As such, the anti-inflammatory and mood-related benefits of Mediterranean diet (MED) adherence result due to a synergistic action of nutrients composing this dietary pattern.  Due to the complex etiology of depression, there is currently no universal and effective treatment. In order to make the case for clinical application of Mediterranean diet (MED) in effective prevention and management of depression, we used subgroup analyses to explore the association between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and the prevalence of depressive symptom in different populations.",b4af9f59-de73-44ec-82f9-2a970d3ac61a
23,discussion5," Results revealed that aMediterranean diet (MED) score has a significantly negative relationship with depressive symptom in most populations, except among patients earning a high annual income or suffering diabetes, borderline blood glucose levels or PD. Previous study reported that high annual income earners generally have higher aMediterranean diet (MED) scores (5). In addition, most American adults do not adhere to dietary patterns resembling Mediterranean diet (MED). This phenomenon may explain the lack of a statistically significant association between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom among high annual income earners. Furthermore, cognitive impairment is one key risk factor of depression (40). Cognitive impairment is also known to be a main complication of diabetes and PD (41, 42). This may similarly explain the lack of a statistically significant association between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom in patients suffering diabetes or PD.",42ced4c5-a10f-429b-b4f2-b40cc59a2880
24,discussion6," Interestingly, the protective effect of Mediterranean diet (MED) on depressive symptoms was noted to gradually decrease as BMI increased. The prevalence of depression is known to be increased in the setting of obesity, a condition that promotes inflammation as well as resistance to insulin and leptin (43, 44). Thus, a combination of Mediterranean diet (MED) adherence and proper weight control is guaranteed to improve the effectiveness of Mediterranean diet (MED) adherence in regard to alleviating depression. No or little association of Mediterranean diet (MED) score with depression among younger women, however, has also been reported due to genetic factors (45). We found that age and sex do not influence the relationship between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom. Therefore, further research is needed to confirm the aforementioned discrepancies.  There were some limitations in our study.",b0b3efd0-3109-4e1d-b3d5-de71d06f5fcd
25,discussion7," First, due to the nature of cross-sectional design of present study, residual confounding from unmeasured confounders should be a concern. Second, dietary intake was assessed by asking subjects to recall what was eaten over the prior 2 days and thus may not accurately reflect the typical dietary patterns of subjects. Third, due to missing data, some psychiatric comorbidities were not considered as covariates in our analyses. For example, eating disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were not considered in this study (46, 47). Moreover, the state of mental health cannot be ruled out in regard to exerting a significant influence on the association between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depression as cognitive function and prescription medications were not assessed in this study. In addition, possible misclassification of dietary behavior due to memory bias may have occurred during data collection.",90dbe54a-7572-4dcc-a2ab-7e37018c3801
26,discussion8," Finally, although the PHQ-9 is a validated screening tool designed to assess depressive symptoms, it is not intended for use in the diagnosis of clinical depression. Furthermore, as diagnostic delay of depression in clinical practice is common, our findings might be caused by reversion causation; we were unable to consider this phenomenon when performing analyses due to a lack of relevant data (48). Future studies are warranted to clarify the impact of diagnostic delay on the relationship between Mediterranean diet (MED) and depression.  Conclusions  In this study, the relationship between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom was demonstrated to be non-linear. Our findings confirm that Mediterranean diet (MED) alleviates depressive symptom at aMediterranean diet (MED) scores of 3 or greater.",88a8be1a-86fe-4dfa-b25f-7460c633c03e
27,discussion9," However, the association between aMediterranean diet (MED) score and depressive symptom in populations earning a high annual income, as well as suffering diabetes, borderline blood glucose levels or PD, requires further evaluation.
