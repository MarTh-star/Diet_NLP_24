0,methods0," Study population  This is a population-based cross-sectional study, and participants were drawn from the second phase of AmolCS. A comprehensive data collection was done in two different phases, including 2009–2010 (phase 1) and 2016–2017 (phase 2). A multistage sampling technique was applied. All twenty-five rural and sixteen urban health centers of Amol city, north of Iran, were the source of the sampling frame of the study. Sixteen strata with 10 years intervals including 10–19, 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, 80–89 years of age were selected. The random selection of study subjects in each stratum was conducted proportionally to the population size. Participants with excessive alcohol consumption of more than 30 g/d for men and more than 20 g/d for women, viral hepatitis, and those on medication known to cause fatty liver, weight loss, or weight gain in the last 3 months before sonography (n 486) and pregnancy/lactation (n 153) were excluded.",96ec49df-bd31-4e8a-9de8-703b4604a118

After excluding subjects with missing data for abdominal ultrasonography (n 166), covariates (n 186), and food frequency questionnaire (n 249), as well as misreporting energy intake (n 228), ultimately, 3220 subjects, including 1438 women and 1782 men, were analyzed in the study (Fig. 1). Excluded subjects had a comparable socioeconomic level as those who remained in the study.Figure 1 Flowchart of the study design.  Dietary assessment  Recruited patients answered a 168-items semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire adapted to the Iranian society to assess usual dietary intake34.",e1f44215-2159-416d-abeb-870591d72c51
2,methods2," Participants reported their average frequency of each food item on the previous year per day, week, month, and year, or never. The reported portion size and frequency of food intake were converted to daily intake, and the portion size was converted to grams by household measures35. Nutrient and energy intake were calculated by the US Department of Agriculture (US Department of Agriculture (USDA)) Food Composition Table (FCT)36 because the Iranian FCT is incomplete. The Iranian FCT was used alternatively for traditional foods not listed in the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) FCT37.  Creation of dietary scores  We followed the methodology of Fung et al. to calculate Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary scores38. Accordingly, we constructed a Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score based on eight components emphasized or minimized in the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and each of them was placed into quintiles.",c22290de-28bd-4195-9398-448b7a2b3cdd
3,methods3," One point was allocated for receiving fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, nuts, and legumes at the highest quintile, and for the remaining components (intake of sodium, soft drink or sweet beverage, red or processed meats), low intakes were desirable.  MeD Score was calculated based on the Trichopoulou et al. methodology by taking into account the consumption of nine food groups. Whether the participants' adherence to each MeD component they received a score of 0 or 139. Daily servings of fruits, vegetables, whole grain, nuts, legumes ratio of grams of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) to saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)) equivalent to, or greater than, the median intake of the study population, and also daily servings of dairy products and meat poultry, red and processed) less than the median intake of the study population received one point.  Residual method energy adjustment was conducted for all food groups before the score ranking.",f4ce9ff5-cba5-48a2-91de-c446c245c4ba
4,methods4," Finally, participants were categorized into tertiles based on their MeD scores.  Abdominal ultrasonography  Sonography was used for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and it was defined as hepatic steatosis after the exclusion of secondary causes of fat build-up in the liver (e.g., drug-related steatosis, excess alcohol consumption, and viral hepatitis). One expert sonographer performed all ultrasound examinations and was blind and not involved in any of the cohort procedures. Sagittal, longitudinal, lateral, and intercostal views were provided through a 3–5 MHz transducer. Similarly, related criteria for fatty liver confirmation included blurring of portal or hepatic veins plus a marked increase in hepatic echogenicity.  Laboratory and anthropometric assessments  Serum collected from 2016 to 2017 was applied to the measurement of all laboratory tests.",b1d820ee-6442-456d-b9af-3297da45da07
5,methods5," Blood samples were drawn after overnight fasting, and serum obtained from whole blood was used for biochemical analyses using an automatic BS-200 chemistry analyzer (Mindray, China). After whole blood samples incubation at room temperature, they were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Laboratory parameters included; fasting blood sugar (fasting blood sugar (FBS)), HDL, TG, total cholesterol, liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase), CRP, hepatitis B virus surface antigens, and hepatitis C virus antibodies.  After 5 min in a quiet place, participants' blood pressure was measured in a seated position, using a manual sphygmomanometer. Properly fitted cuffs and calibrated monitors were used. Korotkoff noise appearance and disappearance were considered as systolic and diastolic values, respectively. The mean value of the two measurements was taken.",df3daaba-8824-4e00-8a1f-d780ffb8d6fe

17,discussion0," The current study investigated the association of a priori defined Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and MeD dietary patterns with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study contributes to furthering our understanding of the associations between diet and diseases in specific world regions, where social factors and dietary patterns may be distinctive. Indeed, the findings suggested that favorable adherence to healthful dietary patterns, including Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and MeD, was inversely associated with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk in Iranian adults.  Our findings are consistent with a cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study on 3051 Chinese adults aged 40–75 years, which revealed adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was independently associated with a lower prevalence of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)21.",3e3bc561-e667-417f-a686-090009d07de9
18,discussion1," A previous randomized controlled clinical trial in 60 overweight or obese Iranian adults with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) revealed adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet for 8 weeks, compared with the control diet, improved liver enzymes, and some Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk factors, including weight and serum triglycerides, and inflammatory and insulin resistance markers22.  In addition, the inverse association MeD on Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in our study was concordant with other studies4,23,24. For example, a cohort study by Baratta et al. showed that adherence to MeD had a preventive effect on Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (OR: 0.801, P = 0.018)25. Further, a meta-analysis including seven observational reports and six randomized clinical trials showed that adherence of MeD can significantly reduce BMI (effect size = − 1.23 kg/m2; 95% CI − 2.38 to − 0.09 kg/m2), weight (effect size =  − 4.",6d969096-9cb3-4ea1-b8b9-f6c95c0c2dcb

Moreover, Kaliora et al., in a 24-week prospective diet intervention study on 44 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients with simple steatosis, concluded that adherence to MeD improves liver imaging, liver fibrosis score, blood pressure, fasting glucose, HgA1C, and several other biomarkers, compared with pre-intervention values27.",4902cc5f-78be-4f6c-83c0-bcb337b38482
20,discussion3,"  Several mechanisms have been posited to contribute to the desirable effects of adherence to healthful dietary patterns, including MeD and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH), on Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which consist mainly of higher intake of vegetables, fruits, plant-based proteins (nuts and legumes), whole-grain cereals, and micronutrients such as calcium, potassium, and vitamin C, dietary fiber, monounsaturated fatty acids, and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as polyphenols and other antioxidant agents28. Currently, strong evidence-based data supports the advantages of healthy dietary patterns in controlling most risk factors for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)16; for instance, Dorosty et al. reported that consumption of whole grains for 12 weeks, independent of weight loss, beneficially affected liver enzymes concentrations, and fatty liver in patients with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)29.",fc5b58bd-fbd5-4c9a-80ca-b8250ebb1cd5
21,discussion4," Based on the observed benefits of the MeD components on Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in our study, non-Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) individuals had a greater intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)/saturated fatty acids (SFA) and lower intake of animal protein sources (red meats and poultry) than those with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Current evidence-based data also suggests a positive association between consumption of red meats and chicken, rather than marine animals, with hepatic status in obese subjects30.  Regarding the possible mechanism associated with a MeD and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), its effect on improving cardiometabolic outcomes (such as reducing triglycerides or fasting plasma glucose)31 or the antioxidant properties32 of healthy diets can be pointed to.",63af565c-da64-4cd2-b80a-f931c8ed7455
22,discussion5," On the other hand, the American Heart Association recommendations, which emphasize healthy dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or MeD, rather than specific food items, can be referred to33.  According to our findings, the favorable association of Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and MeD was more pronounced in women and especially subjects with abdominal obesity. After adjusting for multiple confounders in subjects without abdominal obesity, adherence to MeD was also inversely related to Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The rationale for why the relationship was significant only among women could be attributed to an increased willingness to adopt a healthy diet. In our study, female participants, compared to males, independent of energy intake, had a greater consumption of fruits, vegetables, and lower dairy products, animal protein, and sweetened beverages.",08b6ff79-b0ba-4078-8ed5-4d01ee008530
23,discussion6,"  In the current study, adherence to Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and the Mediterranean diet was inversely associated with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence in patients with abdominal obesity. Indeed, a similar result remained for MeD and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients without abdominal obesity as well. This result suggests that MeD might represent a better choice for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) management, as reported by evidence26.  Although we present a novel addition to the literature, the present study has some limitations. The main limitation of this study is the lack of a liver biopsy as the gold standard to assess the extent of liver damage in Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which could not be performed on the outpatients, as well as the cross-sectional nature of the study which precludes causal inferences being made.",69921e1d-f5d7-4008-8180-e99b816adc9d
24,discussion7," Moreover, recall bias and measurement error related to assessing food intake using validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) cannot be easily ruled out in our study. Further, possible residual effects due to incomplete adjustment for remaining confounders may have affected the outcome variables. Furthermore, since some of the Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) participants may have already adopted healthy lifestyles, following physician advice may lead to achieving a high dietary pattern score among patients. However, this tendency may contribute to the unfavorable association between healthy dietary patterns and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and we still observed an inverse relationship in our study. Finally, our study population was comprised solely of adults of the north of Iran; therefore, the extrapolation of our findings to all Iranian adults must be made cautiously.",bbba22a0-14cc-4a8a-8b2f-3c902f88b432
25,discussion8,"  Conclusion  The findings of our study suggested a favorable association between the adherence to Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and MeD with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Iranian adults, especially women and subjects with or without abdominal obesity. However, further prospective investigations are needed to confirm the veracity of this suggestion. ",66030fab-f45e-43e7-840d-825b57ebc54a
