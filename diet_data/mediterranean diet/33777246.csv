0,methods0," 2.1. Sample Collection  During the year 2017, a total of 179 pairs of mothers and their children (10–12 years old) attending two public primary schools in Thessaloniki (from the areas of Neapoli and Ampelokipi), Greece, were recruited.  Inclusion criteria were: (1) adolescent children, aged 10–12 years old (students in the two senior primary school classes); (2) willing to participate; and (3) with an adult mother living the in same household as them. Exclusion criteria were: (1) children of younger ages; (2) no provision of parental/guardian participation consent; (3) having adolescent mothers; and (4) having mothers who were not residing with them in the same household. Sample characteristics are presented in Table 1.  2.2. Weight Status and Anthropometry  In children, body weight was measured during morning hours using a digital Seca 874 scale (Seca GmbH and Co., Hamburg, Germany) [33]. Height of children was measured with a portable stadiometer (Seca 214, Seca GmbH and Co.",e0eee2ed-e788-40cf-bdef-27afe39fe63a
1,methods1,", Hamburg, Germany). Maternal weight and height were reported.  Waist circumference was measured at the iliac crest [34,35], and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was also calculated.  Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated for each participant (mother or child) as the body mass (kg) divided by height squared (m2). For the assessment of body weight status, the International Obesity Task Force (International Obesity Task Force (IOTF)) [36] criteria were employed for the children, and the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) cutoffs for Body mass index (BMI) were used for the mothers [33].  2.3. Diet Quality  Diet quality was evaluated as the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD). For children, the Mediterranean Diet Quality index for children and adolescents (KIDMED) questionnaire was used [37]. The KIDMED consists of 16 food-frequency questions based on the main components of the MD.",12f6d330-d5c0-4edd-871e-46175d8849c7
2,methods2," Total KIDMED scores range between 0 and 12, with greater scores being indicative of greater MD adherence. Scores >8 indicate optimal adherence and diet quality, scores ranging between 4 and 7 suggest moderate adherence, and scores <3 indicate the adoption of a diet in need of improvement.  Similarly, for the women, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MedDietScore) [38] was employed. Total scores range between 0 and 55, with greater scores suggesting better diet quality on the basis of the MD principles. Maternal diet quality was categorized as good when the MedDietScore exceeded 45 points, average at 23 < MedDietScore < 45, and low when the calculated score was below 23 points in total.  2.4. Dietary Intake  Dietary intake was assessed using 24 h recalls, with the assistance of experienced dietitians (M.P., E.-A.M., and M.B.).",5c01c63b-29dc-49e4-ba0c-b8c24621e179
3,methods3," Records were analyzed using Food Processor software (ESHA Research, Salem, Oregon), and the daily intake of energy, protein, and selected micronutrients was calculated for each participant.  2.5. Diet Diversity  The household diet diversity score (Hdietary diversity score (DDS)) [39] was employed to evaluate variety in the dietary intake of mothers and their children. The questionnaire consists of 12 binary (yes/no) questions, each receiving 0/1 points, evaluating the consumption of different food groups. Scores closer to 12 (maximum score) are indicative of greater diet diversity. The Hdietary diversity score (DDS) has been previously used in the Greek population [2].  2.6. Household FI  Household FI was evaluated using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS)) [39]. The questionnaire consists of 9 questions evaluating uncertainty and stress regarding food access, food quality, and food quantity during the past month.",d1e87f1c-4b27-4e3b-a4c0-b966e19e2ee9
4,methods4," The total Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) score ranges between 0 and 27, with greater scores being indicative of greater FI. The questionnaire has been previously used in the Greek population [1,2].  2.7. Statistical Analyses  Normality in the distribution of the variables was assessed through graphs and the Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test. Independent sample t-tests were used to identify differences in normally distributed variables, and the Mann–Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data. Data are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) (normally distributed data), or as medians and their respective interquartile ranges (interquartile ranges (IQR)) for non-normally distributed data. McNemar–Bowker test was used to assess differences between nominal parameters. Spearman’s correlation coefficient assessed the correlation between children’s KIDMED and mothers’ MEDDIET scores.",11bbf8cc-c36d-44df-b6d9-4e27de4b174f
5,methods5,"  Univariate logistic regressions were performed to identify the association between children’s MD adherence and FI (dependent variables) and each independent variable. Children’s MD adherence was coded as moderate/greater MD adherence versus lower MD adherence (reference group), while FI categories included any level of FI (low, moderate, or severe) vs. food security (reference category). In the aforementioned regressions, maternal MD adherence was the main variable of interest, and the rest of the independent variables can be seen as covariates. For the multivariate (ML) models, only those variables with a p-value < 0.200 were included. Similarly, the diet quality of the children (dependent) was also assessed through ML analysis.  Data were analyzed using Τhe Jamovi project (version 1.2.27.0) [40] and PASW Statistics 21.0 (IBM SPSS Inc., Hong Kong, China).  3. Results  3.1. Weight Status  The majority of mothers were normoweight (57.9%) (Table 2), with 31.",ab7d2b9d-6c19-4190-8c1f-e1e0f071c399
6,methods6,"4% of the mothers being classified as overweight, and the remaining 10.7% as obese. Likewise, the majority of children were normoweight (64%), 26.4% demonstrated an excess in body weight, and the remaining 9.6% were classified as obese. However, based on the McNemar–Bowker test, no statistical association was observed between the weight statuses of mothers and children.  3.2. MD Adherence  Only one of the mothers demonstrated optimal MD adherence (Table 3). The majority (98.9%) exhibited moderate adherence to the MD. On the other hand, the majority of children (59.8%) followed a diet of moderate quality, 25.7% adhered to a diet of optimal quality, and the remaining 14.5% demonstrated low diet quality.  There was a weak negative correlation between children’s KIDMED and mothers’ MEDDIET continuous scores, as tested by Spearman’s correlation coefficient (r = −0.101, p = 0.181).",264c0725-9911-47c6-bfba-1f13c527571f
7,methods7," When children’s diet quality was explained through logistic regression, it was revealed that maternal MD adherence was a negative effector of a child’s adherence to the MD (Table 4).  3.3. Household FI  The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) revealed that the majority of the mother–child pairs (74%) were food secure. On the other hand, 26% reported some degree of FI, with 11% experiencing mild FI, 8% living in moderate FI, and the remaining reporting severe FI. Between food secure and insecure households, mothers residing in the latter exhibited lower MD adherence (Table 5), but no other differences were noted regarding the characteristics of participant pairs (age, Body mass index (BMI), etc.), their dietary intake, or their diet diversity.  The prevalence of FI within single-parent families was 64.7%. As a result, single-parent families were more frequently encountered in the food-insecure households as compared to the food-secure ones (23.4% vs. 4.",fb0d677f-eba9-43f5-8189-c3ab8aec6689
8,methods8,"55%, respectively, p ≤ 0.001). No differences were noted in the prevalence of maternal or child overweight and obesity between food-secure and -insecure households or between single- and two-parent families (data not shown).  The ML model revealed that higher maternal education appeared to act protectively against the onset of FI, whereas having a single-parent family, with mothers being the primary caretakers, increased the odds of food insecurity vs. food security (Table 6).  4. Discussion  The present study indicates that 26.3% of the households with an adolescent aged between 10 and 12 years old experience some degree of FI. This prevalence is even greater (64.7%) within single-parent families with the mothers as the primary caregivers. Furthermore, the results suggest that household FI is dependent on maternal education and single-parent family status with mothers being the primary caregivers.",9b62ec75-9f2a-4dcd-89d9-498a7b5eccf7
9,methods9," Moreover, an early adolescent’s diet quality appears to be inversely related to the diet quality of the child’s mother. No differences were noted in the weight status of participants or their dietary intake between food-secure and -insecure households.  Previous research in Canada suggested that the children of food-insecure mothers tend to consume more unhealthy foods and demonstrate a reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables [20]. In the present study, FI was not an effector of a child’s diet quality; however, maternal diet quality was inversely associated with children’s adherence to the MD. According to a recent Spanish study [41] assessing the diet quality of mother–child (8–10 years old) pairs, the maternal intake of vegetables, fish, fruits, legumes, pasta/rice, dairy products, nuts, and baked goods was positively related with the corresponding child behaviors.",dde8b955-277b-4a48-9f44-f9ab53056d3d
10,methods10," Similarly, in Norway, maternal diet quality was the strongest prospective predictor of a child’s respective MD adherence at 3 and 8 years of age [42]. Similarly, research in Australia suggested that the maternal postnatal diet was more strongly associated with a child’s diet quality and fruit and vegetable variety compared to the diet adopted during the gestational period [43]. This indicates that children may also act mimetically, copying their mothers’ habits. In less-affluent countries, however, this pattern is slightly altered, but still valid. In rural Timor-Leste, mothers appear to adhere to a strikingly poor diet, low in animal-source foods, while providing more animal-source foods to their children [25]. Nevertheless, maternal dietary quality still explains a child’s diet in Timor-Leste [25] and Ethiopia [29]. In the present study, the inverse relationship between maternal and children’s diet quality is in contrast to the aforementioned examples.",40001978-0d34-4d65-8d72-63b21d64f04c
11,methods11," However, research has suggested that when experiencing financial difficulties, mothers tend to lower their diet quality in order to afford a good diet for their offspring [19,24]. Thus, it is likely that a tight financial situation might have been the driver of this behavior. Recently, another group of researchers also noted similar behaviors in Greece [44], with the parents reducing the quality of their own diet in an effort to secure a better diet for their children.  Research in adults has associated FI with reduced MD adherence [2,11,45] and low diet quality [13,14,15,19,46,47,48,49,50,51]. Among food insecure adolescents, those living in Lebanon exhibit a lower adherence to the MD [52,53], and in Taiwan they exhibit a diet of lower diet diversity [16]. In the U.S.",6be682fb-b3ee-4c7f-a870-6899d3ab2b5b
12,methods12," [19], children with FI tend to have a lower intake than recommended for many important micronutrients, and in Canada, reduced diet quality is observed in food-insecure children, paired with a greater energy intake from ultra-processed foods [48]. However, the number of studies conducted on children and adolescents is limited; thus, it is difficult to discern if household FI has a significant effect on the diet quality of adolescents living in more affluent countries [18]. According to a meta-analysis [19] pooling a sample of U.S. adults and children, although FI is associated with a lower diet quality in the former, the children’s results appear less consistent.  Underemployment contributes to the defining characteristics of FI, namely economic strain, financial vulnerability, and poverty. A plethora of studies have shown that unemployment [54,55,56] and underemployment [57] are both associated with an increased risk of FI.",97f8d8da-f3c7-4a54-90e5-9dfa57239da5
13,methods13," In Quebec, food-insecure individuals are more likely to perform multiple jobs to reach a viable income and report higher job stress [57]. Moreover, gaining full-time employment status has been shown to decrease the severity of FI among low-income Canadian adults [58].  In the present study, the risk of FI was higher among single-mother families, whereas a greater maternal educational attainment reduced the odds of FI. Inevitably, when only one member of the family is bringing money into the household, the risk of FI increases [57]. Thus, research from Canada, Australia, and the U.S. agrees in the fact that FI is greater in single-mother households [57,59,60]. Herein, the prevalence of FI tripled in single-mother homes. In the U.S., 27.8% of households headed by a single woman were food-insecure during the year 2018, whereas in the present study, the respective prevalence was approximately triple.",884d23e5-e1d2-45ed-80ea-221ef8c6aa9e
14,methods14," Nevertheless, is should be noted that the sample was not representative of the single mothers residing in the country, while in parallel, it is well-known that the results of the 2008 economic crisis were direr in Greece compared to other countries.  In the U.S., a 1% increase in annual inflation was associated with a 0.5% increase in the prevalence of FI [61], indicating the direct relationship between food prices and the incidence of FI. Thus, maternal diet quality and, by inference, FI are closely related to the SES and the level of educational attainment of mothers [62,63]. Moreover, FI appears to affect diet quality through the employment of specific food-shopping practices, driven mainly by an effort to reduce costs for food [15,64]. As a result, individuals with FI often select energy-dense foods of low micronutrient quality [15] and tend to make fewer shopping trips, relying mainly on nonfresh produce [65].",369cccb8-0b0b-4ad4-84af-eb81bb4715bf
15,methods15," Low maternal education is associated with lower levels of nutrition knowledge, and this may affect household FI, through the inability or reduced ability to manage food resources. As a result, several lines of evidence have associated maternal education [63,66] and nutrition knowledge with household FI [67,68]. On the other hand, a greater ability and self-confidence in managing food resources in the household is associated with a lower risk of FI [69]. Thus, interventions aiming to increase maternal nutritional knowledge can also improve household FI [70,71].  The limitations of the present study include the relatively small sample and the lack of a representative sampling strategy. Nevertheless, this effort constitutes the first of its kind in the country, using mother–child pairs and aiming to evaluate diet quality.",b6e02994-922e-437b-b629-ea29cecc7a4e
16,methods16," Previous research in Greece has revealed a similar prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents as well as a similar diet quality [72,73], indicating that the present sample was rather representative of the child population.  5. Conclusions  Even marginal FI has been positively associated with adverse health outcomes [74], and the need to break the vicious cycle of life-long FI is evident. The present findings indicate that, irrespective of the general financial strain the Greeks are enduring, single-mother homes are particularly affected and require multidisciplinary state actions to alleviate the prevalence of FI and improve diet quality among children. Furthermore, the findings suggest that during periods of financial constraints, maternal diet quality is compromised at the expense of affording a better diet for the minors in the family.
