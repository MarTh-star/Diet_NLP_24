Discussion  This study was planned and conducted to evaluate the effect of intermittent fasting status on resting energy expenditure (REE), body composition, and nutritional status in the 18-hour period of intermittent fasting (18/6) after Ramadan. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first time examining these effects, especially energy expenditure in healthy adults due to intermittent fasting of Ramadan in Turkey.  The first question in this study sought to determine changes in nutritional status by the following Ramadan fasting period. Until recently, there has been no clear evidence of the effects of intermittent fasting on individuals' dietary energy and nutrient intakes [18–23].",22fa613d-e94a-40b2-b29e-49d6d23a808e
15,methods16," The current study found that some changes were observed in the energy and nutrient intakes of the participants at the end of the Ramadan period. However, the observed differences except for protein intakes between baseline and post-Ramadan in this study were insignificant (Table 1). Interestingly, only females statistically significantly had less dietary protein intake after the Ramadan period (Table 1). This interpretation differed from that of a study conducted on 240 adults, which suggested that dietary protein intake was determined to decrease only in male participants [18].  Furthermore, a study reported no difference in energy and nutrient intakes of young women during Ramadan fasting despite the decrease in the number of meals [19]. Another study in individuals with type 2 diabetes noted that total energy, energy from carbohydrates, and protein intake after Ramadan fasting were similar to those before Ramadan, while energy from fat intake of individuals increased [20].",217f9134-0821-4e12-8e79-4dcd4204cb63
16,methods17," Also, it showed that total energy intake during Ramadan fasting did not differ from baseline while high fat and protein increased [24]. By contrast, it was determined that there was an increase in daily energy intake during Ramadan, but fat, fatty acids, and cholesterol intake decreased parallelly with the decrease in the number of meals in healthy young individuals [21].  Besides the changes in energy and nutrient intakes, a study found that Ramadan fasting caused changes in the food pattern and dietary diversity in adolescents [22]. Another study suggests that adolescents' motivation to fast during Ramadan was due to spiritual decisions rather than weight control or other factors [25]. In the present study, it is thought that the fact that the number of meals does not change may be the main reason for the lack of difference in dietary energy and nutrient intakes.",d3e688e9-f7ee-4a88-8ca6-58453b58f08d
17,methods18," Because losing weight is not generally targeted in intermittent fasting of Ramadan, and there is no restriction on the total number of meals. Also, this discrepancy could be attributed to differences in age groups and health status.  One of the most important findings of this study was the decrease in body weight (−2.9% vs. −1.4%), body mass index (BMI) (−3.1% vs. −2.1%), and fat-free mass (−2.7% vs. −1.4%) in both males and females after Ramadan fasting (Table 2). The impact of intermittent fasting programs on body composition and disease-related clinical/health parameters is not clear. Prior studies showed these effects might vary according to the intermittent fasting type (26–28). A study showed that implementing an alternate fasting program in normal-weight, overweight, and obese participants for 3 to 12 weeks resulted in a decrease in body weight (3–7%) and body fat (3–5.5 kg) and improvements in blood lipid profile.",681081d9-8bcc-4ef6-9329-5104cba212a3
18,methods19," In addition, whole-day fasting practice was also reported to cause reductions in body weight (3–9%) and body fat over for 12–24 weeks, resulting in a reduction in total cholesterol (5–20%) and triglyceride (17–50%) levels [26]. Another study evaluating the effect of Ramadan fasting in healthy men, significant reductions in body weight, body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle mass, and lean body mass was found similar to the current study [27]. Moreover, no significant effects were observed on mood, appetite, and quality of life parameters [27]. On the contrary, a 14-hour fasting type for 28 days caused minor changes in body mass index (BMI) without greatly affecting the body composition, glucose metabolism, and cognitive function (−0.2 kg/m2) in another study evaluating the effect of intermittent fasting in the Ramadan model on body composition in healthy lean men [28]. A recent meta-analysis showed significant decreases in body weight with Ramadan intermittent fasting [7].",9a988d2e-1ff8-4ba6-8b3f-f28729ccd83b
19,methods20," In a systematic review and meta-analysis study evaluating the effects of Ramadan fasting in healthy participants, body weight loss was correlated with body mass index (BMI). It was also reported significant reductions in body fat percentage (1.46%) in overweight or obese participants but not in normal-weight participants [29]. It was even noted that the participants returned to pre-Ramadan body weight and composition in 2–5 weeks after the end of Ramadan [29]. Likewise, a study showed that adolescents regained their lost weight (∼1.5 kg) 1 month after Ramadan [23]. Taken together, there is also a risk of regaining weight after Ramadan type of fasting [23, 29]. It is considered that other intermittent fasting programs should not be generalized to Ramadan fasting program.  Another important finding of the present study was that body composition changes in male participants due to Ramadan fasting tended to be more extensive than females (Table 2).",11684fcb-dea0-4ddd-8928-2057ea0e9e26
20,methods21," The literature supported that changes in body composition caused by Ramadan fasting varied depending on gender and age [7, 18, 30]. Similar to this, in a meta-analysis evaluating the effect of Ramadan fasting on body weight in healthy participants, it was found that Ramadan fasting changed body weight especially in males [30]. Another study on adults reported that Ramadan fasting provoked loss in body weight and lean body mass, but the change in body mass index (BMI) and body composition due to Ramadan fasting was the highest in males under 35 years of age [18].  The most surprising result in this study was that the total sleep duration of both genders because of Ramadan was not statistically different compared to the baseline period (p > 0.05) (Table 3). In fact, Ramadan is a fasting practice in which changes in sleep and activity occur, often accompanied by changes in the release of certain hormones associated with the circadian rhythm [31].",84afb63c-ba79-4d8e-89a2-cb5582121f0f
21,methods22," Changes in activity status and sleeping habits may occur in Ramadan [31]. The effects of experimental fasting practices on cognitive function, sleep, and wakefulness status have been shown in previous studies [27, 32, 33]. However, it is suggested that experimental fasting practices should not be generalized to Ramadan fasting practice in the literature [33]. The rapid eye movement (rapid eye movement (REM)) sleep proportion could be decreased after fasting practices and therefore causes significant changes in sleep architecture. However, well-designed studies have also shown that fasting practice does not affect circadian rhythm [33]. Moreover, when another study evaluated the effects of Ramadan fasting on insomnia parameters by dividing the Ramadan into three-phase (before, middle, and last periods), it was determined that insomnia during the day improved, especially from the middle to the last days of Ramadan [27].",920a8943-34a5-4814-9d11-b04a21b53543
22,methods23," So, no difference was thought to be observed in total sleep durations between before and post-Ramadan because the sleep duration at the baseline and end of Ramadan was only evaluated in this study.  In the present study, physical activity levels (PAL)s and energy expenditure values for physical activity in both male and female participants were not found to be statistically different before and post-Ramadan (p > 0.05) (Table 3). In the same way, activity status during Ramadan fasting (physical activity levels (PAL): 1.54 vs. 1.51) did not change compared to the period before Ramadan in young women [20]. However, it is often reported that Ramadan fasting increases sleepiness during the day and may reduce physical activity [34]. In addition to activity status, the effect of Ramadan fasting on hydration status has been investigated in the literature [35, 36].",23aa5d8b-6f0b-421b-a539-f91682bd5461
23,methods24," In a systematic review, body mass index (BMI), body fat, and body fat percentage during Ramadan have been reported to be lower compared to the baseline period. Still, lean mass and total body water did not change during Ramadan in subjects [35]. However, literature mainly indicated that Ramadan fasting could induce dehydration, marked by an increase in blood measures and hydration markers, but no detrimental effects on health have yet been directly attributed to negative water balance, at the levels that may occur during Ramadan [36]. Likewise, in the current study, it was found that total body water decreased in both male and female participants after Ramadan fasting (p < 0.05) and the changes in total body water, intracellular and extracellular fluid amounts (L), in males after Ramadan period was greater than females (p < 0.05) (Table 2).",bc9dca4d-c8c0-4b21-b0fe-8967a76cfd2a
24,methods25," It is thought that this may be caused especially by the loss of fat-free mass in participants and this fluid loss may be a risk for weight regain after the Ramadan period.  One of the most striking findings of this study was that resting energy expenditure (REE) (kcal/d) levels were significantly decreased in females, whereas Total energy expenditure (TEE) (kcal/d) levels were significantly decreased in males after Ramadan fasting (p < 0.05) (Table 3). Although there is some evidence reporting the positive effects of intermittent fasting on body weight and health markers, as mentioned before, the effects of intermittent fasting on energy balance and energy expenditure have not yet been clarified [31, 37].",d9d560ce-3e5c-4853-bea8-8dbbe12bfa81
25,methods26," In a randomized controlled trial on adult participants (30–36 lean and 30–36 overweight/obese participants), (i) daily calorie restriction (reducing habitual daily energy intake by 25%), (ii) intermittent fasting with calorie restriction (alternating between 24-hour periods of fasting and feeding to 150% of habitual daily energy intake), and (iii) intermittent fasting without calorie restriction (alternating between 24-hour periods of fasting and feeding to 200% of habitual daily energy intake) were performed [38]. As a result of the study, it was found that all practices of intermittent fasting affect postprandial metabolism and energy balance components in both lean and overweight/obese participants [38]. By contrast, there is some evidence that resting energy expenditure (REE) and Total energy expenditure (TEE) did not change by Ramadan fasting [31, 37].",565a7a3a-015d-4d02-9d06-79f3c796f156
26,methods27," Supporting this, a study determined that Ramadan fasting decreased activity level and sleep duration but no change in resting energy expenditure (REE) and Total energy expenditure (TEE) levels in nonobese healthy adults. Besides, it was reported that weight losses mainly occurred due to changes in dietary intakes [37]. On the contrary, in the present study, as an exciting finding, the most important determiners of post-Ramadan resting energy expenditure (REE) (kcal/d) were found as baseline resting energy expenditure (REE) (kcal/d) levels and physical activity markers in the multiple linear regression model (Table 4). So, this study has shed light on how Ramadan fasting changes energy expenditure regardless of many factors such as dietary intake, body composition, and activity status.  Ramadan fasting is the state of intermittent glycogen depletion and repletion.",22844bc8-59c8-4105-b44d-fabb3d6ff552
27,methods28," However, the precise mechanism of the effects of Ramadan fasting on substrate oxidation as well as on resting energy expenditure (REE) (kcal/d) and Total energy expenditure (TEE) (kcal/d) remains not to be elucidated. While carbohydrates are used as the primary fuel source in the early morning hours, lipids become more important in the afternoon and especially when it is about to be iftar time [31]. The effect of Ramadan fasting on substrate oxidation was not evaluated in the current study. Therefore, further research in this field would be a great help for understanding changes in energy expenditures because of intermittent fasting practice.  Also, it is stated that Ramadan intermittent fasting reduces cardiac stress among hypertensive patients [39]. However, in our study, blood pressure was no different between before and post-Ramadan. Since this study was conducted in healthy individuals, it may not have detected a difference.  5.",85ebeec3-4b0f-4732-932f-697690cfc821
28,methods29," Conclusions  In conclusion, it can be concluded that intermittent fasting of Ramadan can lead to undesirable decrease in resting energy expenditure (REE) (kcal/d)-Total energy expenditure (TEE) (kcal/d), and also alter body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) and body composition especially in fat-free mass, and hydration status, even if the participants are healthy. These effects can be varied in different genders. No significant effects on dietary energy and nutrients were determined after Ramadan fasting. So, the empirical findings in this study provided a new understanding of the effects of intermittent fasting of Ramadan on energy expenditure, body composition, and nutritional status. However, the generalization of the results of study may be limited in people with disease history and to other cultures in which the fasting practices of Ramadan might be different.",ecae3426-2e98-4de7-9818-688b938e3460
29,methods30,"  In future studies, Ramadan fasting with physical activity in a larger sample group is of interest in changing body composition and energy expenditure. Besides, it may be considered to include the population with having different health problems, but it is obvious that long-term fasting is not easy, especially in people with certain metabolic diseases. Also, Ramadan fasting' effects on body composition and Total energy expenditure (TEE) need to be evaluated long term.

31,results1," Introduction  Intermittent fasting is an interventional strategy where participants are exposed to various fasting situations. Intermittent fasting is defined as the nutrition type, which causes a decrease in daily total energy intake (50–100%) due to food intake restriction in full or partial (e.g., 16–48 h) at certain times of the day, 1–3 times a week, or prolonged night time [1, 2]. Since ancient times, especially in the treatment of epilepsy, mainly in ketogenic diet applications, it has been used in various ways [3]. However, its popularity increased when its effect on the potential improvement of metabolic abnormalities was determined experimentally [4]. It is reported that it may have potentially positive effects on obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancer types due to changes it causes in body weight and metabolic parameters.",6d423e73-0ccd-4c3c-bc22-39ee793737c5
32,results2," It can also be performed in association with circadian rhythm, intestinal microbiota, and lifestyle habits that can be modified such as diet, physical activity, and sleep [5]. It has also been reported that adaptation may be better in this type of diet than other dietary practices [6]. Nowadays, the ultimate goal of most intermittent fasting regimens is to improve body composition [7]. However, losing weight is not typically targeted in the intermittent fasting type of Ramadan.  Intermittent fasting has many types such as (i) complete alternate day fasting (full-fasting for some foods/drinks every other day), (ii) modified fasting regimen (restriction twice a week, 5 days ad libitum feeding), (iii) time-restricted feeding (<3 meals, prolonged day or night fasting), and (iv) religious fasting (Ramadan fasting and other religious fasts) [5, 8, 9].",b482e4f5-deba-43e2-b1a6-3d5c8f5d4a55
33,results3," For example, during the Ramadan month (the ninth month of the Islamic calendar), Muslims do not eat or drink anything during daylight hours, eating one light meal (the “sahur,” “suhoor,” or “sehri”) just before dawn and another (the “iftar”) after sunset 29–30 days [10].  Fasting means avoiding food intake for a certain time depending on religious and/or spiritual traditions. Although it changes with the religions/traditions, depending on the season and geographic location, the restriction period for food intake varies between 12 h and 4 weeks [11]. It is reported that fasting may cause a 0–40% decrease in daily energy intake. However, the frequency of meals usually remains the same in this diet [12]. On the other hand, changes might occur in fluid intake and hydration [13]. For these reasons, changes in body weight may occur during the Ramadan period. A meta-analysis study reported that the average body weight loss during the Ramadan period could be 1.24 kg and 0.",a6fd4964-16fa-472c-bd47-b98fa26e4e18
34,results4,"76 kg body weight gain within 2 weeks following Ramadan [12]. In a recent meta-analysis, Ramadan intermittent fasting is effective in decreasing body weight (−0.353; 95% CI [−0.651, −0.054]) and relative fat mass (−0.533; 95% CI [−1.025, −0.04]) [7].  The mechanism by which intermittent fasting or Ramadan fasting caused these changes in body weight is still unclear. There are very few studies in the literature on the effect of intermittent food intake on energy expenditure [1, 14]. Animal studies have demonstrated that there may be an improvement in muscle coordination, increased activity, and increase in energy expenditure in the wake of time-limited isocaloric nutrition practices [14].",52622724-4f33-4e40-a80d-94eb001c74fa
35,results5," In a study, the effect of intermittent/restricted diet for 8 weeks (16/8) on basal metabolic rate (basal metabolic rate (BMR)) in males who perform resistant exercise was evaluated and it was reported that there was no change in thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)) level, but the level of triiodothyronine (T3) decreased in resting energy expenditure (resting energy expenditure (REE)) [1]. These mentioned food intakes and body composition changes are desired in some cases; however, they may also cause undesirable results via these underlying mechanisms. So, more research is needed on the effect of intermittent fasting and/or Ramadan fasting on energy expenditure and its mechanism of effect in humans.  We hypothesized that Ramadan fasting might affect body composition and resting energy expenditure (REE).",59db371a-c304-4258-82cf-aa4bddce9d92
