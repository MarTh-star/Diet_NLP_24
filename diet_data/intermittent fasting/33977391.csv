Rats fed a methionine‐restricted diet have a reduced incidence of age‐related pathologies and are up to 45% longer‐lived than control‐fed littermates; methionine‐restricted mice receive similar benefits (Miller et al., 2005; Orentreich et al., 1993; Richie et al., 1994). Beyond improving overall survival, MR confers several metabolic health benefits to rodents, including reduced white adipose tissue accumulation, protection against hepatosteatosis, improved glycemic control, and altered plasma levels of multiple nutrient‐sensing hormones that regulate metabolism and healthspan (Malloy et al.",b29cf36d-6cf3-40f3-91f5-e42003d5c7ab
4,abstract4,", 2006, 2013; Miller et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2019). Indeed, such metabolic benefits are so robust that continuous MR completely protects rodents against the diet‐induced obesity that results from consumption of a high‐fat diet meant to approximate the human Western diet .  Previous studies from our laboratory and others have suggested that the response to MR is conserved and that continuous MR is likely to confer healthspan benefits to humans similar to those observed for rodents (Dong et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2019; Johnson & Johnson, 2014; Olsen et al., 2020). Given that the vegan diet is low in both total protein and free amino acids, continuous MR is possible for humans. Unfortunately, long‐term compliance to such a diet is likely to be challenging. Consequently, we and others in the aging field have sought to develop simpler and/or more practicable interventions that produce similar healthspan benefits to MR.",d66b63b1-573b-4c73-9cb5-8eb9d83b8088
5,abstract5,"  Multiple studies have demonstrated that intermittent variants of well‐characterized dietary interventions can have healthspan‐extending effects comparable to, and in some cases, greater than, those of their continuous counterparts. Continuous calorie restriction (CR), which is characterized by a 15%–60% reduction in caloric intake, is associated with extended healthspan and improved body condition in a number of model organisms (Weindruch & Sohal, 1997). Intermittent CR, defined as 24 h of ad libitum food consumption followed by 24 h of CR, is just as effective as continuous CR at reducing adiposity and improving body condition in mammals (Varady, 2011; Varady & Hellerstein, 2007). In addition, as compared with continuous CR, more lean body mass is preserved by intermittent CR, indicating that the latter intervention might not only be easier to sustain, but also preferable in terms of physiological outcomes.",c9e12f78-9c34-4972-af13-66e41265a9c6
6,abstract6," Intermittent fasting, an intervention that is similar to intermittent CR, but marked by a total, rather than partial, reduction in calories during the restriction period, produces similar benefits (Varady, 2011). Another extensively studied healthspan‐promoting dietary intervention is the ketogenic diet (KD), which is high in fat, low in carbohydrates, and features adequate total protein and free amino acids (Newman & Verdin, 2014). The composition of this diet forces the body to rely on the metabolism of fat, rather than carbohydrates, and the ketone bodies produced are associated with positive health outcomes . Interestingly, a recent study found that an intermittent variant of this diet (i.e., cyclic KD) is actually more effective than continuous KD at conferring some of the benefits associated with this intervention .",57a9199b-0784-41a1-93d5-1065ccff97c7
7,abstract7," Together, these observations prompted us to ascertain whether an intermittent variant of MR might confer to mice the healthspan benefits typically associated with continuous MR.  To test whether intermittent MR (intermittent MR (IMR)) is capable of producing similar healthspan benefits to continuous MR, we developed two increasingly stringent dietary interventions (intermittent MR (IMR)1 and intermittent MR (IMR)2), characterized by alternating periods of methionine repletion (4 days) and methionine restriction (3 days). We assessed the relative abilities of these interventions to protect against the diet‐induced obesity typically observed for animals fed a high‐fat, methionine‐replete diet. We also measured several other physiological parameters known to be positively altered by continuous MR.",b81dd27c-8d13-4626-b73b-bbd434ef0739
8,abstract8," Here, we show that only 3 days of MR per week is sufficient to produce the healthspan benefits typically associated with continuous MR, including dramatically lower white adipose tissue accumulation, protection against hepatosteatosis, improved glycemic control, elevated ketone body production, and altered plasma levels of IGF‐1, FGF‐21, leptin, and adiponectin. Together, our results support intermittent MR (IMR) as a more practicable form of MR that confers similar health benefits to the continuous intervention.  2 restriction (RES)ULTS  2.1 Like continuous MR, intermittent MR (IMR) protects male mice against diet‐induced obesity  In order to assess the ability of intermittent MR (IMR) to confer the benefits typically observed for continuous MR, we made use of the diet‐induced obesity model.",3d919b9f-6b8d-45f0-b49e-3642e5e6ce0f
9,abstract9," Specifically, this model tests the ability of an intervention to protect mice against the increased adiposity, impaired glycemic control, and other poor health outcomes that result from chronic feeding with high‐fat diets; such diets provide nearly 60% of total calories from fat. In this context, we developed two intermittent variants of MR characterized by decreasing methionine content (Figure S1). The first of these (intermittent MR (IMR)1) features a cycle of 4 days of ad lib feeding of a methionine‐replete control diet (0.86% methionine), followed by 3 days of ad lib feeding of an isocaloric methionine‐restricted diet (0.12% methionine). The second intermittent MR (IMR) regimen (intermittent MR (IMR)2) also features a cycle of 4 days of ad lib feeding of the control diet, but in this case, is followed by 3 days of ad lib feeding of an isocaloric diet that is totally devoid of methionine.

For the initial study, wild‐type male C57BL/6J mice were fed, as follows, for a period of 6.5 weeks: 1) continuous control diet (CF), 2) continuous methionine‐restricted diet (MR), 3) intermittent regimen intermittent MR (IMR)1, and 4) intermittent regimen intermittent MR (IMR)2. Body mass and food consumption measurements were made regularly until the end of the experiment (Figure 1a‐c, Figure S2), at which point animals were sacrificed and multiple parameters representative of overall body condition and metabolism were assessed (Figure 1d‐i). Inguinal and perigonadal fat pads were surgically resected and weighed (Figure 1e‐f), as were livers (Figure 1g), which are prone to lipid accumulation (i.e., steatosis) in animals fed a high‐fat diet.",bba3a25d-5518-405f-831b-c7dc089e48be
11,abstract11," Using this approach, we found that the more stringent intermittent MR (IMR)2 regimen was similarly effective to continuous MR at protecting male mice against the dramatic weight gain observed for control‐fed animals (Figure 1a,d). Further, animals subjected to intermittent MR (IMR)2 showed significantly less inguinal adiposity than controls, similar to continuously methionine‐restricted littermates (MR, 70%; intermittent MR (IMR), 52%; Figure 1e). Interestingly, identical trends were observed for the accumulation of perigonadal adipose tissue (MR, 70%; intermittent MR (IMR), 52%; Figure 1f). Even when normalized to lean body mass, the same inhibitory effect of the intermittent MR (IMR)2 regimen on adiposity was observed (Figure S3a‐b).",649e1fda-c160-4892-8e21-2cfdee55a672

However, the robust effects of the more stringent intermittent MR (IMR)2 regimen on male mice demonstrate the efficacy of intermittent MR (IMR). At the end of the experiment (Day 46), the average total body mass of animals subjected to intermittent MR (IMR)2 was broadly similar to that of continuously methionine‐restricted animals (25.9 g vs 21.8 g; Figure 1a,d), and much less than that of controls (32.8 g). Notably, the observed ~4 g difference in average body mass was due almost entirely to the greater lean body mass of animals subjected to intermittent MR (IMR)2 as compared with continuously methionine‐restricted littermates (24.",08d9f2be-7353-4a31-b18a-d81b5b2b7e25

With respect to the measurements of overall body length (Figure 1i), we failed to detect any significant effects of either intermittent or continuous MR.

Consistent with previous findings, animals subjected to continuous MR consumed their food at a greater rate. When normalized to body size, both intermittent MR (IMR) regimens resulted in rates of food consumption intermediate to those of control‐fed and continuously methionine‐restricted animals (Figure 1c, Figure S2c‐d). Thus, male mice undergoing intermittent MR (IMR) were not calorie‐restricted, confirming that the protection against diet‐induced obesity observed was entirely due to periodic restriction of methionine.",44c71915-019c-4654-91c9-74146586a488

Toward this end, we performed liver histological analyses to determine the relative extent of steatosis in the livers of male mice undergoing the intermittent MR (IMR)2 regimen for 16.5 weeks. As expected, the livers of control‐fed mice showed a preponderance of hepatocytes containing lipid droplets (Figure 1j), whereas the livers of littermates subjected to intermittent MR (IMR) showed a normal architecture relatively free of such accumulations (Figure 1k).",a928d246-ee31-4806-b36f-ad45aa36ec40

While it is known that continuous MR both protects against liver steatosis and results in smaller sized livers (Ables et al., 2012; Malloy et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2019), we recently observed that another healthspan‐promoting dietary intervention (i.e., selenium supplementation) operates similarly in that it has a robust anti‐adiposity effect and produces smaller livers as compared with controls . However, intermittent MR (IMR) only has the former activity, as liver mass was not significantly affected by this regimen (Figure 1g, Figure S3c).  2.",9b8c9be8-f743-4430-94a4-623ffcc608f2
19,abstract19,"3 Like continuous MR, intermittent MR (IMR) confers beneficial metabolic and plasma hormone changes to male mice  To further explore the extent to which intermittent MR (IMR) produces the healthspan benefits typically observed for continuous MR, we assessed multiple circulating analytes from male mice at baseline (i.e., before initiation of the diets), as well as after 42 and 46 days on the diets (with the latter time‐point representing the conclusion of the experiment). For mice on the intermittent MR (IMR) regimens, the 42 day time‐point followed a period of reduced methionine intake, whereas the 46 day time‐point followed a period of methionine repletion. Plasma samples were analyzed by Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)s to determine the concentrations of IGF‐1, FGF‐21, leptin, and adiponectin. These analytes were selected because they are not only altered by continuous MR (Ables et al., 2012; Malloy et al.",90627014-9bea-4b83-81cf-c7a2a4f3b6ee
20,abstract20,", 2006), but have also been implicated in the regulation of metabolism and/or healthspan. Plasma levels of the energy‐regulating hormones adiponectin and leptin are increased and decreased, respectively, by continuous MR, and these changes are likely related to the reduced adiposity of methionine‐restricted animals (Ables et al., 2012; Elshorbagy et al., 2011; Malloy et al., 2006). Levels of the extensively studied hepatokine FGF‐21 are also increased by MR and not only does this hormone play a role in glucose homeostasis , it may also contribute to MR‐dependent lifespan extension through interaction with the IGF‐1 receptor and β‐Klotho . Finally, plasma levels of the anabolic, energy‐regulating hepatokine IGF‐1 are reduced by MR in rodents , and this is apparently sufficient to extend healthspan (Brown‐Borg et al., 2014).",9a1340b9-8a99-4e8b-9d7c-2878fbf1cb13
21,abstract21," That said, we found plasma IGF‐1 levels to be reduced 50% in male mice after 42 days of continuous MR, and saw similar reductions for mice undergoing the intermittent MR (IMR) regimens (40% and 56%, respectively; Figure 2a). After a subsequent 4 days of methionine repletion, mice undergoing both forms of intermittent MR (IMR) showed a restoration of IGF‐1 levels to approximately those of control‐fed animals. In addition, we observed that the plasma levels of leptin followed a similar trend to those of IGF‐1, with concentrations in mice undergoing continuous MR failing to increase over time as they did in control‐fed animals (Figure 2b). Both forms of intermittent MR (IMR) also resulted in the circulating levels of leptin remaining lower than those of control‐fed mice after 42 days on diet (64% and 92%, respectively).",f8e3d9e0-319c-4ef9-bd9a-2160332c6304
22,abstract22," Interestingly, plasma leptin levels remained somewhat depressed in males undergoing intermittent MR (IMR)2 even after a subsequent 4 days of methionine‐replete feeding (66%). In addition, although not as robust as the increases resulting from continuous MR (~85%), modest increases in the plasma levels of adiponectin were produced by both forms of intermittent MR (IMR) following both a period of limited methionine intake (29% and 23%, respectively), and a period of methionine repletion (28% and 41%, respectively) (Figure 2c). This represents one of the few cases where animals undergoing the otherwise less effective intermittent MR (IMR)1 regimen received a benefit comparable in magnitude to those undergoing intermittent MR (IMR)2. Regarding FGF‐21, the levels of this factor in the plasma of male mice fed the experimental diets were as expected, given that FGF‐21 concentrations are known to change dramatically in response to dietary methionine availability (Ables et al.",563f3e63-b0d2-45d7-b959-299c39d9ad60
23,abstract23,", 2012; Perrone et al., 2012). Following a period of limited methionine intake (Day 42), mice undergoing the intermittent MR (IMR) regimens demonstrated increases in FGF‐21 levels (as compared with controls) that were broadly similar to those of continuously methionine‐restricted mice (intermittent MR (IMR)1, 42‐fold; intermittent MR (IMR)2, 87‐fold; MR, 64‐fold; Figure 2d). However, after a period of methionine repletion (Day 46), plasma FGF‐21 levels in animals undergoing both forms of intermittent MR (IMR) returned to low, control‐fed levels. The final circulating analytes assessed for these animals were glucose and insulin, both of which were found to be significantly lower than control levels on Day 42 in the blood of animals undergoing continuous MR (glucose, 32%; insulin, 86%) and both forms of intermittent MR (glucose, 16% and 37%, respectively; insulin, 56% and 87%, respectively; Figure 2e‐f).

With respect to leptin, we observed a significant and persistent reduction in the levels of this hormone in intermittently methionine‐restricted females as compared with control‐fed littermates, remaining 74% lower than control levels even after a period of methionine repletion (Day 130; Figure 4b). For adiponectin levels, we observed a relative increase (47%) on Day 126 for animals undergoing intermittent MR (IMR)2; following 4 days of methionine repletion, these levels lowered yet remained higher than controls (24%; Figure 4c).",43a91a5f-9ee9-4aa3-b673-307109190e3b

Indeed, intermittently methionine‐restricted female mice had lower circulating glucose levels than both control‐fed and continuously methionine‐restricted animals at all time‐points of the feeding study (Figure 4e). Interestingly, we have previously observed that female mice only show reduced insulin (but not glucose) levels in response to continuous MR , a finding that is reproduced in the current study (Figure 4e). It is therefore notable that females undergoing the intermittent MR (IMR)2 regimen maintained relatively low blood glucose levels, the same as males undergoing either intermittent or continuous MR (Figure 2e).",a58adfc3-3417-4571-a13a-47af81381483
36,abstract36," With respect to circulating insulin levels, intermittent MR (IMR) of female mice again resulted in lower levels than those of control animals (Figure 4f). These depressed levels were apparent following periods of both reduced methionine intake (Day 67, 71%; Day 126, 86%) and methionine repletion (Day 130, 62%). To further explore the effects of intermittent MR (IMR) on glucose metabolism, we performed metabolic tolerance tests on 12‐month‐old female mice that were either control‐fed or intermittently methionine‐restricted for 3 weeks (glucose tolerance; Figure 4g) or 5 weeks (insulin tolerance; Figure 4h). For animals subjected to intermittent MR (IMR)2, testing coincided with a period of reduced methionine intake. Given that continuous MR has been previously demonstrated to effectively prevent the glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity otherwise experienced by mice maintained on a high‐fat diet (Ables et al.",4cd58be4-3aae-44dc-98bc-a5f8d6103cbe
37,abstract37,", 2012), we reasoned that intermittent MR (IMR) would result in similar protection. As expected, and consistent with the effects of intermittent MR (IMR) on the circulating levels of both glucose and insulin, mice undergoing this intervention were significantly more glucose‐tolerant and insulin‐sensitive than control‐fed littermates (Figure 4g‐j).  Given that continuous MR has been shown to elevate the circulating levels of the beneficial ketone body β‐hydroxybutyrate , we also tested whether intermittent MR (IMR) shared this capability. As expected, we found the 12‐month‐old female mice subjected to the intermittent MR (IMR)2 regimen for 3 weeks possessed elevated blood levels of β‐hydroxybutyrate as compared with control‐fed littermates (Figure 4k).",352f2e5a-7e6d-4849-9ed6-40648a7473f9
38,abstract38," In total, our experiments demonstrate that intermittent MR (IMR) not only confers to female mice similar beneficial changes in the levels of multiple circulating factors as continuous MR, but also that the novel intervention may actually be more effective than its continuous counterpart at maintaining glucose homeostasis in the face of a high‐fat diet.  2.6 intermittent MR (IMR) and continuous MR similarly alter the plasma levels of multiple sulfur‐containing amino acids  As a final test of the similarities of continuous MR and intermittent MR (IMR), we explored the effects of these interventions on the circulating levels of methionine and homocysteine. Reduced plasma levels of methionine are often, but not always, observed in response to reduced methionine intake (Ables et al., 2015; Elshorbagy et al., 2010; Olsen et al., 2018).",dbe3a578-0380-4081-9a3c-7f73af3cf759
39,abstract39," Somewhat paradoxically, the most robust effect of continuous MR on the circulating levels of sulfur‐containing amino acids is an increase in the levels of homocysteine. As expected, we observed an approximately 70% reduction in the plasma levels of methionine in both continuously and intermittently methionine‐restricted female mice as compared with control‐fed animals (Figure 5a). A similar reduction was observed for males (not shown). Interestingly, in both cases, these reductions were observed for animals undergoing intermittent MR (IMR) after both the methionine‐restricted and methionine‐replete periods (Figure 5a; not shown). As for homocysteine, both continuous and intermittent MR resulted in relative increases in the plasma levels of this amino acid in both male and female mice (Figure 5b‐c).",f1a7034f-2c78-4672-ad0f-bc365744909b
40,abstract40," Following the methionine‐restricted period of the intermittent MR (IMR) regimen, homocysteine levels were ~7‐fold higher than those of control animals, whereas no difference was observed following the methionine‐replete period. Taken together, the shared effects of continuous MR and intermittent MR (IMR) on the circulating levels of both methionine and homocysteine provide yet additional evidence that these interventions are functionally similar.  FIGURE 5 Plasma levels of sulfur amino acids are similar for mice subjected to intermittent MR (IMR) and continuous MR.

42,abstract42," Toward this end, we developed a variant of stringent intermittent MR (IMR) (intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A) that alternates daily between methionine‐restricted and methionine‐replete feeding for 6 days, before concluding each week with a final day of methionine repletion (Figure S1). Thus, in the intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A feeding scheme, 3 days of reduced methionine intake are spread across a 5‐day period, rather than being contiguous (as for intermittent MR (IMR)2). Importantly, the time‐integrated concentrations of methionine availability (0.49%) are identical for both regimens. Adult female mice (9+ months old) were fed the control diet and the intermittent MR (IMR)2 and intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A regimens for a period of 4 weeks, at the end of which their body condition (Figure 6a,d‐h) and food consumption (Figure 6b‐c, Figure S6) were assessed. In addition, the relative levels of multiple circulating markers of metabolism were determined (Figure 6i‐l).",c32fb2d7-f877-4269-ae76-bc4612e64fc0
43,abstract43," We found intermittent MR (IMR)2 and intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A to be similarly effective at protecting mice against the overall weight gain (Figure 6a,d) and inguinal and perigonadal adiposity (Figure 6e‐f) experienced by control‐fed animals. The latter finding was true whether or not fat mass values were normalized to lean body mass (Figure S7). We also found food consumption between all three feeding groups to be essentially equivalent (Figure 6b‐c, Figure S5), confirming that the observed benefits were not due to calorie restriction. As observed previously, the intermittent MR (IMR)2 regimen resulted in modest impairments in lean body mass and overall body length as compared with control‐fed littermates (Figure 6g‐h). However, similar measurements for mice subjected to intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A were not found to be significantly different from either control values or intermittent MR (IMR)2 values. That said, analysis of circulating factors (i.e.",24190959-d076-4b54-85a6-91454a41e945
44,abstract44,", IGF‐1 and glucose) in these animals was technically challenging owing to differences in the timing of the restricted/replete periods in the intermittent MR (IMR)2 and intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A regimens. While control‐fed mice and littermates undergoing intermittent MR (IMR)2 were sampled on Day 21 (the last of 3 contiguous days of restriction for animals undergoing intermittent MR (IMR)2), the most equivalent time‐point for animals undergoing intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A (i.e., the last day of a more temporally expanded period of reduced methionine intake) occurred 2 days prior on Day 19. In addition, given that animals subjected to intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A do not experience an uninterrupted period of reduced methionine intake, as do intermittent MR (IMR)2‐fed littermates, it would be expected that the effects of intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A on the levels of circulating factors (measured on Day 19) might be somewhat less robust than those of intermittent MR (IMR)2 (measured on Day 21).",8f93bf96-76c4-4fd4-94e9-f8517b15f727
45,abstract45," Indeed, this was the case for measurements of IGF‐1, FGF‐21, glucose, and β‐hydroxybutyrate (Figure 6i‐l). Nevertheless, the slightly attenuated values observed for FGF‐21, glucose, and β‐hydroxybutyrate in mice undergoing intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A were not found to be significantly different from those of intermittent MR (IMR)2‐fed littermates. As a result, we consider it likely that the time‐integrated blood concentrations of these factors were similar between animals subjected to intermittent MR (IMR)2 or intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A, consistent with the near identical protection against diet‐induced obesity conferred by these interventions (Figure 6a,d‐f,k, Figure S7). Together, these findings indicate that intermittent MR (IMR) is capable of producing robust healthspan benefits, regardless of the specific timing of the methionine‐restricted periods.",da012c83-9093-47b9-abd7-c1fd18646272

48,discussion0,"  To the best of our knowledge, we show for the first time that intermittent MR (IMR) confers to male and female mice the beneficial metabolic effects previously reported for continuous MR. That is, as compared with control‐fed mice, animals undergoing the more stringent of two intermittent MR (IMR) regimens (intermittent MR (IMR)2) benefit from reduced adipose tissue accumulation, protection against hepatosteatosis, improved glucose homeostasis, and altered circulating levels of IGF‐1, FGF‐21, leptin, and adiponectin. Despite a much shorter interventional period than continuous MR (only 3 days per week), not only is intermittent MR (IMR) capable of producing similar health benefits, but other aspects of this intervention are actually superior to classical MR.",672cfe1a-238e-4cb9-88b9-a1032efe3266
49,discussion1," For example, while we have repeatedly observed that female mice have a somewhat limited response to continuous MR, with this intervention only partially improving their glucose homeostasis in the context of a high‐fat diet , intermittent MR (IMR) results in consistently low levels of both circulating glucose and insulin in both males and females. In addition, we find that the intermittent MR (IMR) regimen is fairly flexible, as similar healthspan benefits are produced whether the period of restriction is continuous (i.e., 3 contiguous days; intermittent MR (IMR)2) or interspersed with days of control feeding, as in the case of intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A.  In terms of how, mechanistically, intermittent MR (IMR) engenders such dramatic healthspan‐promoting effects despite its short interventional period, we first considered the calculated methionine intake of mice undergoing the experimental regimens.",67dd9bec-d2cc-4fd7-b7db-860fb28daea3
50,discussion2," When integrated over a week of feeding, the concentrations of methionine in the dietary regimens should be as follows: 0.86% (CF), 0.12% (MR), 0.54% (intermittent MR (IMR)1), and 0.49% (intermittent MR (IMR)2 and intermittent MR (IMR)2‐A). Consequently, if one were to assume that the extent of the benefits of MR are inversely proportional to methionine intake, then animals undergoing intermittent MR (IMR)2 would, at best, show physiological effects intermediate to control‐fed and methionine‐restricted animals (i.e., 0.86% > 0.49% > 0.12%). Similarly, one would also expect that animals undergoing the intermittent MR (IMR)1 and intermittent MR (IMR)2 regimens would be physiologically and metabolically similar, as the time‐integrated methionine contents of their diets differ by only 0.05%.",dd3e9982-703d-432a-93fa-caef0e3b0225
51,discussion3," As we found neither of these suppositions to be true, we instead favor the explanation that the benefits of MR (both continuous and intermittent) result from a threshold effect; in this case, the reduction of circulating glucose and insulin levels below some critical threshold that, in turn, results in significant and persistent changes in the GH/IGF‐1 signaling axis. In support of such an idea, we found that, during methionine‐restricted periods, circulating glucose was maintained by the intermittent MR (IMR)2 regimen at levels at least as low as those of continuously methionine‐restricted animals. While the low glucose levels resulting from intermittent MR (IMR)2 and continuous MR were comparable for males, the levels in females were far more responsive to the intermittent MR (IMR)2 regimen than to continuous MR.",66dcc158-6c60-4dc5-9385-b301480ffc34
52,discussion4," That continuous MR fails to protect female mice against increasing blood glucose levels (as it does for males) could be (1) a gender‐specific effect, or (2) due to the advanced age of the females used for these studies (9 months old vs 5 months old for males). Previous work from researchers at the Orentreich Foundation and others supports the latter explanation, having found that rodents require less methionine as they age, and consequently, that older rodents show an attenuated response to typical levels of MR (Ishibashi & Kametaka, 1977; Nichenametla et al., 2020; Shin et al., 1994). Thus, the effective maintenance of glucose homeostasis in females undergoing the intermittent MR (IMR)2 regimen is likely due to the brief periods of stringent MR that they experience. In any case, the robustness of the response to intermittent MR (IMR) is consistent with a previous study that found that a period of stringent MR confers significant metabolic benefits to obese mice .",005c14c8-ba1b-4e8a-bf0c-3ab87c73d1d1
53,discussion5," It is also interesting to note that, in the current study, the effect of the intermittent MR (IMR)2 regimen on circulating glucose was relatively persistent, as even after 4 days of methionine‐replete feeding, the blood glucose levels of animals undergoing this intervention often remained lower than those of control‐fed littermates. Such normalization of glucose homeostasis is likely to be a function of altered carbon metabolism, as has been reported for mice, humans, and even yeast subjected to methionine‐restricted conditions (Malloy et al., 2013; Plaisance et al., 2011; Plummer & Johnson, 2019). In turn, as a consequence of maintaining persistently low circulating glucose and insulin levels, intermittent MR (IMR) reduces IGF‐1 hormone levels, thereby producing additional healthspan benefits. Not only have low IGF‐1 levels been previously reported for continuously methionine‐restricted rodents (Ables et al., 2012; Malloy et al., 2006; Miller et al.",fad80944-3860-4be6-a999-edf4a4d4c61e
54,discussion6,", 2005), but also a multitude of other healthspan‐extending interventions are known to both alter carbon metabolism and decrease IGF‐1 signaling, including CR, intermittent fasting, the ketogenic diet, protein restriction, and exercise (Boden et al., 2005; Breese et al., 1991; Dunn et al., 1997; Fontana et al., 2008; Fraser et al., 2000; Rahmani et al., 2019; Scarth, 2006). That continuous MR fails to extend the lifespan of long‐lived dwarf mice that already have constitutively low GH/IGF‐1 levels (Brown‐Borg et al., 2014) suggests that MR extends healthspan by decreasing IGF‐1 signaling. This is further supported by the fact that GH‐overexpressing transgenic mice have an impaired response to continuous MR (Brown‐Borg et al., 2018).",57ba6b7f-d440-499c-b3d5-5329c711ef85
55,discussion7,"  Regarding how the timing of IGF‐1 reductions influences the healthspan benefits that result, it was previously reported that a transient period of food restriction during the first 20 days of life results in low serum IGF‐1 levels and extends the median and maximal survival of mice . The authors suggested that a brief period of food restriction early in development may produce life‐long effects through stable reprogramming of gene expression. Indeed, in a subsequent study, the same group found that mice subjected to such early‐life restriction remain leaner than controls and also have better glucose homeostasis, even 22 months after the interventional period . The authors also demonstrated that activation of the GH/IGF‐1 signaling axis for a period of 6 weeks via regular injections of GH in young dwarf mice (starting at 2 weeks of age) substantially limits the lifespan of these otherwise long‐lived animals .",8cb04276-3e31-4f1b-b178-849db4463cdf
56,discussion8," It is clear from such studies that not only can a transient reduction in circulating IGF‐1 during development confer life‐long healthspan benefits, but also a transient restoration of IGF‐1 activity in dwarf mice can abrogate such benefits. Regarding effects in adult animals, Sun et al. also explored the efficacy of continuous MR initiated at mid‐life (12 months of age) and found that this intervention results in a significant extension of lifespan . Superficially, this result may seem to be at odds with that of Panici et al., which found that reduced IGF‐1 signaling following an early period of GH/IGF‐1 activity is insufficient to support lifespan extension. However, the differing outcomes of these studies may be due, at least in part, to their different genetic contexts (i.e., wild‐type hybrid mice vs Prop1df / Prop1df hypopituitary dwarf mice). When all of the above studies are taken together, the extended lifespan observed by Sun et al.",939aae70-45ea-4258-84f5-37d2731f60a8
57,discussion9," for 12‐month‐old wild‐type mice subjected to MR is probably best explained by (1) the fact that mice have persistently high circulating levels of IGF‐1, even in mid‐life , and (2) the likelihood that any intervention that reduces these high levels or otherwise impairs IGF‐1 signaling, even transiently, will improve healthspan. Thus, it is possible that, like continuous MR, intermittent MR (IMR) will extend the overall survival of mice. While future experiments will reveal whether this is the case, it is clear from the current study that intermittent MR (IMR) produces a multitude of metabolic health benefits previously reported for continuous MR. Further, the more practicable diet (which necessitates an interventional period of only 3 days per week) confers to female mice an improvement in glucose homeostasis that continuous MR fails to provide.",347bea37-8c7c-4d30-9035-06d945b77bc9
