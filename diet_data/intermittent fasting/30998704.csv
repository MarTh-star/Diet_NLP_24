This includes full details regarding the housing and feeding of animals, diet and exercise protocols used in accordance with ethical approval obtained from the Victoria University Animal Ethics Committee (AEC15/007). In the current paper, we will present a brief overview of the animals and supplement groups used. We have provided details about the processing of tissues and subsequent analysis, not published elsewhere.  2.2. Animals Eight-week-old male and female mice (C57BL/6, males = 39 and females = 49) were fed a high-fat (HF) (59% energy from fat, SF03-002, Speciality Feeds, Glen Forrest, WA, Australia) and sugar (S) water (30% sugar w/v) diet for a period of 12 weeks to induce obesity.",99ae3efa-6a55-4382-9f30-ecb92ac580de
1,methods1," One group (males = 8, females = 10) was culled at 12 weeks to serve as the ‘baseline’ comparison group (OBC) for the 24 week control (CON) group and to determine the time effects of a further 12 week of the HF/S diet. All other mice continued consuming the HF/S diet for another 12 weeks, but were randomly allocated (block randomisation) into 1 of 4 groups: no intervention, HF/S only (control (CON); males = 7, females = 9); intermittent fasting diet (IF; males = 8, females = 10); high-intensity interval training (high intensity interval training (HIIT); males = 8, females = 10); and a combination of the diet and exercise (IF + high intensity interval training (HIIT); males = 8, females = 10). At the end of the additional 12 week diet and intervention period, mice (now 32 weeks old) were anaesthetised with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbitone (60 mg/kg).",ef2e47f2-3fd6-457f-a046-54fda6a7cd9b
2,methods2," The left extensor digitorum longus (extensor digitorum longus (EDL)) muscle was isolated, removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Given the high-intensity nature of the exercise training, the fast twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was chosen as most appropriate for investigation. Mice were then killed by cardiac puncture and the abdominal cavity was opened to collect epididymal (males) and periovarian (females) white adipose tissue (WAT), which was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Whole brain was isolated and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Just before RNA extraction, brain was placed in RNAlater solution on ice and hypothalamus was isolated quickly using scalpel. All samples were stored at −80 °C until further analysis.  2.3. mRNA and miRNA Expression Total RNA was extracted from white adipose tissue (WAT) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle using an miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen); and from hypothalamus using a RNeasy lipid tissue mini kit (Qiagen).",fcc9d3fb-33f3-4b8f-a347-9c614eab1564
3,methods3," The RNA content was measured using a nano-drop spectrophotometer (DeNovix DS-11, DeNovix, USA) and RNA quality was assessed using the A260/A280 ratio. The average ratio for all RNA samples was 1.99. RNA integrity was determined using agarose gel electrophoresis with a SYBR™ Green II RNA gel stain (Invitrogen). The 28s and 18s rRNA band ratio between 1.3 and 2 was taken as measure for good RNA quality. RNA was reverse transcribed to generate cDNA using a RT2 first strand kit (Qiagen) from mRNA and a miScript II RT kit (Qiagen) from miRNA and subjected to RT-PCR for gene and microRNA (miRNA/miR) expression using a RT2 SYBR green qPCR mastermix and a miScript SYBR green PCR kit, respectively. Specific microRNAs were selected depending on their relationship with the genes of interest investigated in the present study, based on either previous studies reporting those gene–miRNA relationships or based on the miRWALK database [11].",f9bd96a1-ee45-4b22-be0d-68aaddf58b0c
4,methods4," Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) and RNU6 were used to normalize mRNA expression in white adipose tissue (WAT), in muscle, and miRNA expression in both adipose and muscle, respectively. The average beta-actin (β actin), PPIA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) expression was used to normalize hypothalamus mRNA expression. mRNA/miRNA expression was calculated using the ΔΔCt method.

Further, miR-133a expresion was significantly negatively correlated to TNFα gene expression (r = −0.404, p < 0.05) (Table S7).  4. Discussion The objective of this investigation was twofold: (1) to assess changes in mRNA expression within the hypothalamus, and mRNA/microRNA expression within adipose and skeletal muscle tissue in response to IF, high intensity interval training (HIIT) and the combination of both; and (2) to identify genes and their regulator that could be involved in the prevention of weight gain and improved lipid profiles observed in our previously published paper [10]. In the hypothalamus of female mice, genes involved in energy homeostasis and obesity development, as well as inflammation, were lower following IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) and correlated to body weight and fat mass.",dda35b18-1df0-4d95-b47a-d8cfd1e719ac
21,methods22," Within the adipose tissue, both males and females demonstrated lower expression of genes that were positively correlated with fat mass following IF and IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT). Males demonstrated higher expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation following IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) and, to a lesser degree, IF, which were correlated with lower fat mass, lipid and glucose levels. Conversely, females demonstrated lower expression of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and storage following IF and/or IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) which was correlated to higher glucose levels. However, the effects of diet and/or exercise were not observed in all tissues, with limited impact, statistically speaking, observed in the skeletal muscle.",b085569d-8144-4f6f-bed8-2aa531f3c367
22,methods23," Prolonged IF may have a negative impact on glucose tolerance by downregulating genes involved in metabolic signalling and mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle when concurrently consuming a HF/S diet in both males and females. The current findings demonstrate both sexual-dimorphic and tissue-specific adaptations within diet-induced obese mice following 12 weeks of IF and/or high intensity interval training (HIIT) and while concurrently consuming a HF/S diet. Future work is needed to confirm whether the observed gene changes are driving the body compositional and metabolic improvements or are just a reflection of the current weight (i.e., lower body and fat mass) and/or inflammation status.  In order to determine the directional change in mRNA and microRNA expression due to continued HF/S feeding over the 12 week intervention period, we compared expression levels at 24 weeks (control (CON)) to the 12 week “obese baseline” group (OBC) within all three tissues.",5a0b24fb-bc0a-44a7-9cc5-217de12f78e1
23,methods24," Continued HF/S feeding appeared to have little impact in the hypothalamus, with males demonstrating significantly lower expression of genes related to food intake and energy expenditure (AgRP and BDNF) compared to the OBC group, whereas females demonstrated significantly higher expression of genes related to obesity status and inflammation (NPY and ILβ) compared to the OBC group, which supports previous observations [12,13]. In the adipose tissue, there were clear sexual-dimorphic effects observed between groups. In males, seven out of the nine genes examined (namely, CIDEC, PPARγ, HADH, FABP4, SIRT1, FOXO1 and TRPV4) showed significantly lower expression in the control (CON) group compared to the OBC group. Lower expression of these genes could relate to reduced adipose non-esterified fatty acid efflux, possibly due to decreased lipolysis/oxidation, lipid accumulation and/or insulin resistance as a result of continued HF/S feeding [14,15,16].",854f3784-bf42-427b-9693-571bbb7a5bb1
24,methods25," In female mice, leptin and FOXO1 were significantly higher in the control (CON) group compared to the OBC group. The higher leptin mRNA in females only could be a reflection of differences in fat mass. However, fat mass was similar between groups and continued to increase in both males and females compared to the OBC group (Figure 1C,D). On the other hand, the non-significant change in males could be a reflection of a decrease in leptin sensitivity (and possible downregulation) previously observed in males with long-term high-fat feeding [17]. FOXO1 isoform is known to play a key role in adipogenesis. However, its physiological role in differentiated adipose tissue remains unclear. In the skeletal muscle, PGC1α, CS and TNFα expression was significantly higher in the control (CON) group compared to the OBC group in male mice only.",2a1c314f-088a-473b-bca2-8aae79e1518e
25,methods26," Additionally, lower expression of markers of atrophy were observed in both males and females, though no differences in lean muscle mass was evident between groups [10]. Changes in PGC1α and CS in response to high-fat feeding and obesity have been mixed, with some studies demonstrating an increase [18] and others showing a decrease [19]. Differences could be due to strain of animal, diet composition, and importantly intervention duration, with acute high-fat diet shown to downregulate genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis as well as reduce oxygen capacity, whereas longer term feeding may increase [20,21]. Despite higher expression levels of muscle PGC1α and CS, high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance can still occur, as it is independent of changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial (fat) oxidative capacity or muscle mitochondria function [22].",731a9739-1261-49a3-8a6e-3ad330a13e43
26,methods27," Evidence suggests that male C57BL/6J mice are more susceptible to diet-induced obesity and are likely to present the negative effects of a HF/S diet earlier compared to female mice which are typically impacted to a lesser extent and in a much slower manner [23]. This could be due to females having a higher capacity for storing fat in adipose tissue and oxidizing fatty acids in muscle [24]. Indeed, OBC male mice displayed significantly higher glucose intolerance (glucose area under the curve (AUC)), and monophasic glucose curves following glucose tolerance test compared to females after 12 weeks of the HF/S diet. Sex differences were still present and generally enhanced after 24 weeks of the HF/S diet. Male mice demonstrated significantly higher fasting glucose compared to OBC, whereas female mice demonstrated significantly higher insulin levels and markers of insulin resistance compared to OBC.",8c15c22c-14da-4353-b10e-5dcbdc12e147
27,methods28," Whether greater (and earlier) susceptibility to a HF/S diet in male mice compared to female mice explains the contrasting changes in some genes expressed, especially within the adipose tissue, requires further investigation. Since the current investigation was unable to compare between 0 week and 12 week, the authors cannot comment on changes within the first 12 weeks. Notwithstanding, several miRNAs, including miR-143, exhibit inverse patterns of regulation, with upregulation in pre-adipocytes (cell culture model) and downregulation in mature adipocytes (animal model) [25]. The contrasting changes in miRNAs, specifically the downregulation in later stages, could be due to the chronic local inflammation environment and enhanced TNFα levels often observed in adipose tissue of an obese phenotype.",3a9d80b4-7d34-4ea7-b06b-ec2f3eedd8f6
28,methods29," Although we did not measure TNFα expression in adipose tissue in the current study, we did measure levels within skeletal muscle and hypothalamus, with males demonstrating significantly higher levels in the control (CON) group compared to the OBC group in skeletal muscle, but not the hypothalamus.   Hypothalamic POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons are critical nodes of a circuit that sense key metabolic cues as well as regulate metabolism. Elevated hypothalamic NPY and decreased POMC are thought to promote the development and maintenance of obesity [13]. The effects of calorie restriction and fasting appear to be inconsistent with 12 weeks of moderate continuous restriction (18%) in mice, demonstrating no significant effect on hypothalamic NPY or AgRP expression, but causing a significant increase in hypothalamic POMC expression [26]. Conversely, 3 weeks of a more severe restriction in the form of IF increased expression of AGRP and NPY in the hypothalamus of Sprague–Dawley rats [27].",d8875a31-5520-44cf-bf6e-0a81737e7254
29,methods30," While the cellular properties of these neurons have been investigated in the context of obesity and diet, much less is known about the effects of exercise training. Recently, repeated bouts of high intensity interval training (HIIT) training (3 × 20 min) demonstrated, in a time-dependent fashion, an inhibitory effect on NPY-expressing neurons while eliciting an overall excitatory effect in adjacent POMC-expressing neurons [28]. Conversely, others have shown no effect on NPY and POMC mRNAs expression levels and food intake after one month of high-intensity exercise [29]. In the current investigation, only the combination of IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) significantly influenced the expression of hypothalamic NPY and POMC.",61b22baa-6430-4252-9adb-943f68be51b0
30,methods31," NPY expression was significantly reduced following IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) compared to control (CON) in females, whereas POMC was significantly increased following IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) in both males and females, but only significantly when compared to high intensity interval training (HIIT). NPY expression was positively correlated with body weight and fat mass at the end of the intervention period. Decreased expression of NPY and to a lesser degree, increased expression of POMC, could potentially contribute to the attenuation of weight gain when undertaking IF and high intensity interval training (HIIT) despite concurrent consumption a HF/S diet. However, further work is needed to explore such a concept.  Adipose tissue mass is determined by the storage and removal of triglycerides in adipocytes. Adipocyte lipid turnover, however, is strongly related to conditions with disturbed lipid metabolism.",ec499c3c-1fbb-4620-9556-2472217247c2
31,methods32," In obesity, the triglyceride removal rate (lipolysis followed by oxidation) is decreased and the amount of triglycerides stored each year is increased. It was evident from the control (CON) group, compared to 12 week OBC, that markers of adipocyte differentiation (PPARγ), β-oxidation (HADH) and lipid removal (FABP4) were lower, especially in males. Reduction of both triglyceride storage and removal decreases lipid shunting through adipose tissue and can promote dyslipidaemia [30], which supports evidence that males are more susceptible to diet-induced obesity compared to females. Notwithstanding the sexual-dimorphic observations in the control (CON) group, similar responses were observed between sexes for leptin and TRPV4 in response to diet and/or exercise intervention. Lower expression of leptin and TRPV4 was observed following IF and IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) compared to control (CON).",caa4db84-5c38-4d75-bdf2-dcd059506672
32,methods33," Lower levels of leptin are usually a reflection of lower adipose tissue mass [31]. Indeed, leptin expression was positively correlated with body fat mass in males and females. Leptin expression is negatively regulated by PPARγ [32] and a significant negative correlation (r = −0.414, p = 0.05) was found between PPARγ and leptin gene expression in males in the present investigation. Higher levels of PPARγ, especially in the IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) male group, could be due to higher levels of FABP4, which carries fatty acids from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and can act as a PPARγ ligand [33]. Indeed, FABP4 expression was increased in IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) males compared to all other groups. Previous studies have shown enhanced FABP4 expression after moderate exercise in both the epididymal and retroperitoneal adipose tissues, suggesting an improvement in the morphometric parameters of the adipose tissue [34].",84dbacfc-1767-4bc6-bc66-50472ea73307
33,methods34," Increased FABP4 and PPARγ expression in the IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) group could be contributing to the superior anthropometric benefits observed in our previous study [10], with higher expression levels correlated with lower fat mass. Another important contributor to reduced fat mass in males could be HIF1α, with the present study demonstrating lower expression levels in all intervention groups compared to control (CON), albeit only significantly in males after IF and IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT). HIF1α, a marker of hypoxia [35], is also known to inhibit fatty acid oxidation and energetic uncoupling via transcriptional repression of sirtuin 2 (Sirt2). Adipose tissue hypoxia-induced HIF1α activation suppresses the Sirt2-NAD+ metabolic regulatory system, leading to reduced oxidative lipid catabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis mediated in part through the inhibition of PGC1α activity [36].",4777a7a8-9c88-44af-91a6-09c864f5816f
34,methods35," Although the current investigation did not measure PGC1α or HIF1α protein levels in adipose tissue, we did measure expression of HADH, a rate-limiting enzyme of mitochondrial β-oxidation [37]. Expression of HADH was significantly higher following IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) in both males and females, though it was only statistically significant compared to the IF group.   PPARγ also cooperates with FOXO1 in pre-adipocytes to induce a post-mitotic growth arrest for subsequent differentiation [38]. FOXO1 modulates energy homeostasis in white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (brown adipose tissue (BAT)) through regulation of adipocyte size and adipose tissue-specific gene expression in response to excessive calorie intake. In the present study, only female mice demonstrated lower expression of FOXO1 following IF and IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) compared to the control (CON).",8032896f-b2e7-4228-b61a-7ebc237dd976
35,methods36," Reduced FOXO1 expression may suggest a decrease in transition from clonal expansion (i.e., cell cycle) to terminal differentiation in pre-adipocytes [38], and while this may occur with advancing obesity and dyslipidaemia, as seen with our control (CON) males compared to females, it may also be further reduced as a result of fasting with or without exercise. TRPV4 expression was another gene modified by both IF and IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) in both males and females. The role of TRPV4 in obesity and obesity development is sometimes conflicting, with knockout of TRPV4 shown to increase weight gain and promote obesity during high-fat treatment in mice [39], whereas others have shown that administration of GSK205, an inhibitor of TRPV4, upregulates the expression level of thermogenic genes such as PGC1α and UCP1, which further promotes the browning process in 3T3-F442A adipocytes [40].",f8f6d1a5-446f-48a5-8fb0-71161b9904a6
36,methods37," Indeed, our control (CON) group demonstrated significantly lower expression of TRPV4 compared to the OBC group, and similarly, our IF and IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) groups demonstrated significantly lower expression compared to control (CON). The contradictory role of TRPV4 in adipogenesis and obesity requires further research, especially regarding the effects of lifestyle intervention on its expression.  In skeletal muscle, SIRT1, PGC1α and UCP3 was significantly lower in both males and females following IF compared to control (CON) and, in some cases, compared to high intensity interval training (HIIT). Reduced levels or compromised activity of PGC1α can be associated with the development of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes [41]. Acute high-fat feeding for 3 days has been shown to downregulate PGC1α expression in skeletal muscle [18], while 22 days of alternate day fasting had no significant effect on expression levels [42].",05c4e40b-2487-449f-bf50-d7b36a87534f
37,methods38," Conversely, exercise has been shown to enhance expression of PGC1α [43]. In the present study, 12 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) was unable to significantly affect PGC1α expression levels, which may be due to the lower exercise volume used compared to others [43]. However, it is possible that the HF/S diet consumed while training is negating any beneficial molecular changes from exercise as reported in previous studies [44]. This could also be the reason why IF was unable to have a positive effect on markers of fatty acid metabolism with persistent overload of fatty acids to skeletal muscle as a result of consuming a HF/S diet creating a metabolic gridlock and 2 days of fasting unable to sufficiently improve. IF did result in a worsening of glucose tolerance in both males and females [10] and SIRT1 and AS160 expression was significantly correlated to fasting glucose and/or glucose tolerance and thus could play a contributing role.",6a1a422c-34be-431e-89f1-9f0ea2509dd2
38,methods39," Lower expression of atrophy markers MURF1 and MAFbx was observed following IF with or without high intensity interval training (HIIT) in females, which may indicate a protective effect on lean muscle mass, as previously reported in other studies [45,46]. Conversely, high intensity interval training (HIIT) induced higher expression of these markers, albeit only significantly compared to control (CON) in the male mice. This could be a reflection of greater remodelling rather than muscle atrophy per se. Indeed, higher expression of MURF1 and MAFbx after 8 weeks of exercise training has previously been reported and associated with higher skeletal muscle turnover rather than an indicator of greater atrophy [47]. Any benefits within skeletal muscle could be driven by lower inflammation levels, with TNFα expression significantly lower in all intervention groups (p < 0.01).",9c92e7ca-c995-4c34-be4a-43103f1d753f
39,methods40," Though not observed in female mice, the observations in males is in line with previous human [48] and animal studies [49].  5. Limitations There are several limitations that exist in this study. Firstly, given the invasive nature of sample collection, the current investigation was unable to compare within-subject changes, as only post-intervention samples could be excised and analysed. However, to gain an understanding in the direction of mRNA and miRNA expression, we compared samples obtained from one group at 12 weeks to the control (CON) group at 24 weeks. We understand that this is a limitation, given that samples were not obtained from the same animal. Secondly, our investigation did not have a ‘true’ baseline sample (prior to HF/S feeding) and no samples were obtained prior to 12 weeks of HF/S feeding. Furthermore, we did not have a standard chow diet control.",a431c1f2-1461-4ed8-9b7d-08105607a24f
40,methods41," Thus, we cannot comment on the acute molecular changes as a result of diet only, as the confounding effects of obesity status are most likely present at 12 weeks. Given that mRNA and miRNA expression can be transient and sometimes inverse when compared acutely and chronically, we were unable to investigate this, especially any sexual-dimorphic differences, as mentioned in the manuscript. Thirdly, our investigation only focused on expression of mRNA and miRNA and thus it unclear whether similar changes are occurring at the protein and/or function level. It is evident that changes in some mRNAs may not reflect changes in the protein and/or function level, but also, inverse changes may occur between mRNA and protein/function. Finally, miRNAs targeted in the present study were selected on the basis of their correlation having been already reported (literature or in silico), and most of them did not show any significant correlation to the targeted gene.",6f152e74-d03c-4413-b116-0152f95508ef
41,methods42," This does not simply imply their non-involvement in obesity but needs more thorough investigation to establish their role.  6. Conclusions The major findings of the study are summarised in Figure 7. The combination of IF and high intensity interval training (HIIT) appeared to have the greatest effect on gene expression, especially within adipose tissue and in males, compared to either intervention alone. There were clear sexual-dimorphic effects, especially within adipose tissue, with males demonstrating higher markers of fatty acid oxidation, rather than a reduction in adipogenesis/storage, as observed in females. Correlations between genes PPARγ, FABP4 and/or HIF1α expressed in adipose tissue and lower levels of fat mass, plasma LDL levels and glucose observed in our previous paper [10] suggest potential key molecular pathways that could be underpinning the greater improvements in IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) compared to other groups.",73455897-bede-4f7d-bfc1-0a64c86e48b1
42,methods43," This could be a reflection of the greater energy deficit created by the two interventions when combined. However, given fat depots between males and females are distinct anatomical entities and the possible existence of sex-dependent recruitment and modulation of peri-ovarian and epididymal fat depots, caution should be taken when interpreting and comparing diet- and exercise-induced changes in white adipose tissue (WAT) mRNA expression between males and females. Interestingly, the HF/S diet appeared to negatively impact skeletal muscle, especially in those undertaking IF, which may be a result of increased fat delivery/supply to muscle from the diet but also fasting-induced ketosis during metabolic slowdown. This investigation is unlike other studies, we examined the impact of a lifestyle intervention on diet-induced obese mice but with continued consumption of a very-high-fat and sugar diet.",c0525a88-85db-4995-98a2-4a80c1f118cc
43,methods44," Therefore, based on the body composition, metabolic and gene expression data, the beneficial effects of IF and high intensity interval training (HIIT) are limited. Thus, future research should determine whether the widely touted benefits of IF and high intensity interval training (HIIT) are still evident while concurrently consuming a high-fat and sugar diet (i.e., a typical Western diet), or whether diet also needs to be changed when undergoing such interventions. Notwithstanding, it is clear that adaptions are sexual-dimorphic and tissue-specific, with inconsistent changes observed at the end of the intervention. Understanding changes at a molecular level can help provide mechanisms for the body composition and metabolic adaptations that typically occur with such lifestyle interventions and, importantly, may help identify key physiopathological networks in order to design suitable therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity and associated disorders.
