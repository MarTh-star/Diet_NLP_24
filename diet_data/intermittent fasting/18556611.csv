0,introduction0,"The availability of energy in the form of food is a critical factor in the maintenance of the reproductive capacity of mammals. Low, moderate and high levels of dietary energy intake can affect reproductive function in different ways. Maintaining reproductive capacity is an energy-consuming process which is tightly regulated on a gonadal transcriptional level. It is presently unclear how dietary energy intake affects gonadal gene regulation. We have shown previously that low, moderate and high energy diets affect male and female rats differently on biochemical, endocrine, behavioral and genetic levels [1], [2]. At a fundamental level, the maintenance of reproductive capacity is the most crucial function that animals need to maintain and, therefore, the capacity to identify and secure energy in the form of food is essential to maintain reproductive status.  We have previously shown that alterations in caloric intake in rats had significant effects upon the female reproductive axis [1].",19fe2813-3aee-48d5-bfc5-f35b7c4d260a
1,introduction1," This altered reproductive state was also connected to an increase in cognitive capacity and activity levels, changes expected to improve the chances of females securing food in their environment. Their apparent masculinization in response to extreme caloric restriction probably occurred to aid their competition (with other males or females) for any available food sources. In the females there seemed to be a specific capacity inherent to their hippocampal transcriptional activity to sense their nutritional input. The corresponding males showed no calorie-restriction specific hippocampal transcriptome sensitivity [2]. In this context, at the level of the hippocampus, it appears that males and females seem to engineer a competition between each other for the remaining available food, i.e. the females ‘masculinize’ to aid their competition with any resident males.",c43f8d16-cb1f-4208-a830-181249e39646
2,introduction2," However for animals that generate offspring via sexual reproduction, a cooperativity of activity and response to environmental food availability would be critical. It would be biologically wasteful for either gender to maintain a contemporaneous high reproductive capacity while their opposite gender does not. Whether this linkage is retained in animals that have not been in contact with the opposite gender or have mated is an interesting postulate. It has been shown to some extent that reciprocal ‘anticipation’ of each other's gender's fecundity occurs in natural settings. For example, in free-living spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) their reproductive status (number of successful births) is controlled to some extent by seasonality but much more strongly by variation in their environmental energy availability [3], as this would determine how many fertile females were available to mate.",c8f9f2cc-a3d9-4cea-8955-374066fdb74d
3,introduction3,"  The aim of this study was to identify gender differences in the gonadal transcriptional responses to alterations in the available food energy. To do this, we used multiple dietary paradigms that include calorie restriction (20% CR and 40% CR), every other day feeding (intermittent fasting: IF) and an excessive energy intake diet (high fat/high glucose: high glucose (HFG)). We have elucidated the gonadal transcriptome responses to these different levels of energy intake on a single gene level and on a parametric functional group level. Our findings suggest molecular mechanisms by which males and females differentially modify their reproductive capacity based on the amount and frequency of food availability.

Scanning and quantification The microarrays were exposed to phosphorimager screens for 3 days.",479975d0-212d-46da-af0d-f7da7488d6bd
8,methods4," The screens were then scanned in a Molecular Dynamics STORM PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA) at 50 µm resolution. Quantification of scanned screens was performed with ArrayPro software.  Z-scores and z-ratio Raw hybridization intensity data were log-transformed and normalized to yield z-scores, which in turn were used to calculate a z-ratio value for each gene with respect to the control tissues. The z-ratio was calculated as the difference between the observed gene z-scores for the experimental and the control comparisons, and dividing by the standard deviation associated with the distribution of these differences [52]. Z-ratio values ≥+2.0 or ≤−2.0 were chosen as cut-off values, defining increased and decreased expression, respectively.  Filtering and cluster analysis DIANE (NIH) software was used to filter the 17,000 genes. We filtered out genes which did not vary at least 1.25-fold from the log of the mean of the first filter in at least 60% of the genes expressed (p<0.01).",8920895c-0bb7-4b17-ade8-94ff1c25f103

Measurements for the combined wet mass of the left and right gonads of all the animals (male and female) in the multiple study groups showed that, in general, female variation in gonadal size was negligible compared to that of the males (Figures 2A–B).

22,results3," To maintain an independence of analysis from the rest of the body, we used non-normalized gonadal mass for this instance. For the males the most extreme dietary regimes (40% CR and high glucose (HFG)), with respect to input calories, tended to induce a reduction in total gonadal mass. The 40% CR and the high glucose (HFG) mean deviations from the control average were −14.8±30 mg and −39±30 mg respectively (both n = 8). The greatest mean increase in mass from control was seen with the IF group (44.3±30 mg, n = 8) followed by a smaller increase in mass compared to control from the 20% CR group (2.75±24 mg, n = 8). The large variation in gonadal size prevented statistical significance with respect to raw wet mass. The female gonadal mass variation in comparison to the males was negligible and was therefore potentially indicative of a specificity of male gonadal responsivity to environmental food availability.

Gonadal gene changes were analyzed further to determine commonalities between high and low energy diet groups (Figures 7–8). In a previous study, we found that the hippocampal genetic response to dietary restriction and excess was calorie-dependent in females and calorie-independent in males at both the single gene and functional pathway levels [2]. In the testes, only 29% of the multi-dietary paradigm-regulated genes were CR-specific, i.e. were not significantly regulated (up or down) in the male high glucose (HFG) group (Figure 7A).",ca92a16f-8564-46e2-a62c-4ba8e2f7aa9a

In contrast to the testes, 50% of the multi-dietary paradigm-regulated genes in the ovaries were CR-specific (Figure 7B).

A similar pattern was noted for the Chordc1 gene [4]. As mentioned previously, Chordc1 encodes for a protein involved in forming heat shock protein complexes that can then interact with ATPases and protein phosphatases to modulate the activity of Nod1 in its role in innate immune responses [8]. Amongst the common down-regulated genes, there was a general predominance of genes normally involved in cell stress/death (Cybb, Mapk13, Hspa8) or transcriptional regulation (E2f8, Snrpe).",5774415a-7aea-4d13-8332-fbd855adfd7e

Considering the divergence of gonadal activity between male (consistently active spermatogenesis) and female (cyclicity, controlled conversion between discrete reproductive states) mammals, this is perhaps not a surprising result. When the retention of significantly regulated pathways in common between the transcriptional gonadal responses was analyzed, there were several interesting findings (Figure 14). Representation of the significantly regulated pathways common to more than one dietary regimen between genders, indicates that there was a large number of physiological outcomes that were common between the two genders (42).",2828233e-19ae-44cc-b104-4e9f5c030057

Among the non CR-specific cross gender, multi-diet regulated pathways almost 60% of the pathways demonstrated divergence of regulatory direction. The signaling pathways that demonstrated the most conservancy between diet and gender included those involved in energy regulation (etc, bile acid, glycolysis), immune activity (IL-17) and, perhaps most interestingly, growth regulation/nutrient sensation (IGF1-mTOR).

Gene set to signaling pathway correlation in males and females A simple index of the correlation between the linkage of individually-regulated genes in a gene set and their potential physiological function may provide an indication of the genetic and perhaps evolutionary coherency of an animal's response to its environment. All species have likely created ‘genetic programs’ that facilitate a rapid, coherent and specific genetic output in response to an environmental cue.

When the ratio of significantly regulated genes to significantly populated signaling pathways was assessed for both genders across all dietary regimes (Figure 15A), it was clear that the 20% CR, 40% CR and high glucose (HFG) diets yielded similar gene∶pathway ratios. However, for the IF paradigm, the males demonstrated a considerably greater ratio of genes∶pathways.

Compared to the females, there appeared to be a distinction between the males' response between 20% CR and IF paradigms, i.e. in females there were no specific differences in the T/E ratio or the gene∶pathway ratio between female IF and 20% CR groups (Figures 2, 15).

There was a considerable degree of overlap between the two diets (Figure 15B). The 40% CR females had 10 significantly altered KEGG pathways, 5 of which were common with the IF males. In addition to the 5 shared KEGG pathways, the IF males had 2 unique KEGG pathways that were significantly altered (7 total). The overlapping KEGG pathway groups possessed a strong signaling phenotype as typified by the Jak-STAT and MAPK signaling pathways. This strong degree of transcriptional overlap could potentially underlie a gender-specific connection between the two sets of animals' differential response of males to every other day feeding and to extreme caloric restriction (40% CR) in the females.",898222c4-02d4-48e4-accf-4b893c9b894b
62,results44," With respect to gonadal transcriptional responses it is likely, due to the need for sexual reproduction to be successful to propagate a species, that coherent ‘genetic programs’ are expressed complementarily in males and females in similar environments. ",da178ce1-935f-4b7d-8a49-1b22b1aa2842
63,discussion0,"We investigated the overall gonadal transcriptional responses in adult male and female rats to different dietary paradigms including dietary restriction, every other day feeding and caloric excess. We found that multiple and complex patterns of gene regulation were induced in both the genders in response to the disruption of their food supply. With respect to gonadal structure and function and the nature of the imposed diet, we noted a much greater variation in total testicular weight in response to the alterations in energy intake than in total ovarian weight (Figure 2). Complex endocrine feedback systems, such as the reproductive system, maintain a tightly-controlled homeostasis within that system. Hormones within the reproductive system function in concert and their ultimate physiological function will be determined by their relative plasma ratios to each other. Testosterone can typically function as an antagonist of estrogen, opposing many of estrogen's actions.",a211fb70-a27d-485e-94dd-18ab9127bfc2
64,discussion1," Thus determining the ratio of testosterone to estrogen in plasma is a highly informative method of assessing endocrine homeostasis and functional output within the reproductive system. It has also been clinically demonstrated that through the accurate measurement of specific sex steroid hormone ratios, and not through individual hormone measurements, reliable prognostic data can be generated that correlates with the incidence of multiple pathophysiological or disease states such as male breast cancer [10], hyperthyroidism [11], diabetes [12], [13], cirrhosis of the liver [14], gall stones [14] and bone fractures [15], [16]. Therefore due to the physiological antagonistic activities of testosterone and estrogen, consideration of the relative levels of these potent hormones in animal models or patients is likely to yield more physiologically relevant data.",110adcec-277c-41a1-a5a4-2809e41aee97
65,discussion2,"  A detailed overview of the absolute plasma levels of some of the hormones involved in the major endocrine axes has been provided previously [1]. With respect to the steroidal hormone status of the animals, in males the majority of the diets induced considerable alterations in the circulating T/E ratios, while only the 40% CR diet induced a significant alteration in the T/E ratio in the females. This potentially suggests that the IF males had ‘hypermasculinized’, along with the strong masculinization of the 40% CR females. It is important to note that despite the same effective input calories, the 20% CR and IF males possessed unique gonadal transcriptome responses to the different dietary paradigms. This however was not observed in the females. This suggests that in males there was a specific calorie-independent response to the alternate day absence of available food energy.",8a613b3a-1ccf-4622-9069-2803adb524b2
66,discussion3,"  At the level of specific gene regulation, the females tended to show a greater calorie-specificity in their gene responsiveness in the gonads, reminiscent to what we have previously shown in the hippocampus [2]. Males on the other hand did not seem to be as calorie sensitive in either tissue (Figure 7).  There were several cross-diet genes identified in the female gene sets. The gene Irf1 (interferon regulatory factor 1) was down-regulated in the ovaries of 20% CR and 40% CR females (Figure 7). This gene has been shown to be expressed in the human uterus during the mid to late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, and its expression is regulated by the hormone prolactin [17].",25d033d7-0c9b-471a-b08a-366832f2849e
67,discussion4," In the mouse, Irf1 has been shown to be involved in the remodeling of uterine spinal arteries, which supply blood to the endometrium of the uterus during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and the remodeling of these arteries is a requirement for successful implantation of the embryo during pregnancy [18]. Hspa8 (heat shock protein 70 kDa) was down- regulated in the 40% CR and IF ovaries. This gene has been shown to be sharply increased in the human endometrium after ovulation and is thought to play a protective role during implantation [19]. Gdf9 (growth differentiation factor 9) was increased in the 20% CR and high glucose (HFG) ovaries. This gene is an oocyte secreted paracrine factor essential for mammalian ovarian folliculogenesis [20]. Gdf-9 is co-expressed with BMP15 and these genes work together in the ovary to aid in the differentiation and development of the granulosa cells. Granulosa cells produce steroids and growth factors that aid in the development of the oocyte.",c9e94b6c-4964-407b-8254-d1ce650407ca
68,discussion5," Follicle-stimulating hormone (Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)) stimulates granulosa cells to convert androgens to estradiol, and after ovulation granulosa cells then produce progesterone [21].  Among the multi-diet regulated genes in the males, several are of note with respect to gonadal function. Nuclear RNA export factor 1 (Nxf1) was significantly down-regulated in both the 40% CR and IF paradigms. Nxf1 is also classified as the TIP-(tyrosine kinase interacting protein) associated protein (TIP (tyrosine kinase interacting protein) associated protein (TAP)). Nxf1 expression is tightly controlled, as it has been shown to be crucially involved in the normal development of both male neurons and germ cells in cases of Fragile X syndrome [22]. The cold shock gene, Csda, was specifically up-regulated across two diets that were typified by extremes of energy balance (40% CR and high glucose (HFG)).",b1736d38-cc4b-4c4a-a473-a29f6858ac3d
69,discussion6," These cold-shock proteins have been shown to be crucial for the protection and development of spermatocytes and seminiferous tubules [23]. The gene Ncl (nucleolin) was also up-regulated by two diets (IF, high glucose (HFG)) and has been shown to be highly indicative of rapidly growing cells, as it is important for pre-mRNA processing and potential tumor formation [24]. Indicative of the increased functional activity in the male testes in response to dietary alteration (IF and high glucose (HFG)), there was a significant up-regulation of Nek7 (NIMA-related kinase 7). The Nek7 gene has recently been identified in the testes [25] where it is likely to be a prime controller of cell cycle progression and mitotic spindle assembly [26]. To facilitate additional cell growth/function in response to dietary alterations, it is often necessary to re-model the structure of an organ or tissue. A common series of proteins involved in such processes are metalloproteinases.",6c57b1c7-e013-4155-932f-ab64ca83e56c
70,discussion7," With respect to gonadal function, Adamts19 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain, with thrombospondin type-1 modules), significantly up-regulated in 20% CR, 40% CR and high glucose (HFG) diets, has been shown to be expressed in multiple tissues, and in particular the testes [27], [28]. The down-regulation of genes involved in apoptotic mechanisms would be expected in situations of enhanced cell growth and development, for example in the male IF and high glucose (HFG) paradigms, there was a significant down-regulation of Septin 10. Septins are a highly conserved family of GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins implicated in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and oncogenesis [29].  Taking into account the alterations in gonadal function and gene expression, it appears that males respond in a more reactive manner to the imposition of the various dietary regimes.",ecbb1e4b-6b3d-4a2c-a3b7-cc6e49047650
71,discussion8," When considering genes regulated across multiple dietary paradigms, the males showed a considerably greater degree of up-regulated genes compared to the females (Figure 7). This again was demonstrated when the functional signaling pathways were analyzed (Figure 13). This is perhaps not surprising when the distinct activities of the two genders' gonads are considered. Male spermatogenesis is a relatively robust activity that is maintained for a long period of time in a mammal's lifespan. Females on the other hand, are typically born with a set number of ova that then progressively decrease with time. The activity of the ovary is considerably more complex as it has to be timed to the menstrual cycle. Cyclicity in females is a sensitive phenomenon and can be dramatically affected by dietary perturbations. We have previously shown that female reproductive cycling capacity was considerably affected during the imposition of some of these dietary regimens [1].",fab1012a-0061-475f-9c41-93533490e216
72,discussion9," Even small alterations in input energy caused the females to largely cease cycling. Many previous studies have demonstrated the relative robustness of continued spermatogenesis in the face of dietary alteration in multiple species [30], [31]. It is interesting to note however that in our transcriptional analysis there seemed to be a stronger up-regulating response in the males compared to the females, despite the history of male resilience to environmental dietary alteration. With respect to this observation, perhaps the most important finding was the unique nature of the males' response to the every other day feeding regime. When the relationship between their transcriptional response to IF was compared to the eventual physiological phenotype this may induce, we found that this gene∶pathway ratio was extremely high for the male IF group (Figure 15).",8641a099-bd31-4260-a034-d4c711b1954b
73,discussion10," Comparing this response to the 20% CR males, we are able to conclude that this effect is independent of the input calories to these two groups [1]. This calorie-independent response seemed unique to the male IF group, as the female IF group gene∶pathway ratio was considerably lower. When the genetic output (genes, GO terms and KEGG pathways) of the male or female IF groups were both compared to their corresponding 20% CR groups, there was also a large difference in the male IF response compared to the females (Tables 1, 2). This may indicate that the males possessed a specific response to the periodic absence of food. Even the presence of low levels of food (40% CR) did not induce this high gene∶pathway ratio. The male IF group also showed the highest circulating T/E ratio and the largest degree of change in testes mass (Figure 2).",78bd4e9b-609c-4b35-8599-152a75b8cc26
74,discussion11," Leptin and growth hormone were each significantly decreased in the IF males as were plasma corticosterone levels, though not statistically significantly [1]. These hormonal changes caused by the IF diet are reflective of a tendency towards ‘heightened’ masculinity.  As we have postulated, alterations in the reproductive status of animals that reproduce sexually are likely to occur in a complementary manner. In an environment temporarily devoid of available food, i.e. the IF diet, the male would assume that females also will experience this environment and would therefore have a ‘predictable’ lower degree of fertility, as the females possess a lower capacity to compete for food than the males. Hence for the species to propagate, the male would need to increase the chance that an encounter with a female would result in successful fertilization; and therefore, the male needs a heightened degree of fertility.",d8955cfc-b750-4f3c-82ca-ded6dcb5dd48
75,discussion12," In the male IF group the increased testes mass, elevated circulating T/E ratio and the highest genetic output coherency all suggest a pre-programmed physiological response specific to periods of food absence, and not food paucity. If the male ‘predicts’ the presence of semi-starved females (i.e. the male has no access to food and therefore the poorly-competing female may have even less), then it is likely that there would be a complementarity in gonadal genetic regulation between the two genders. Thus, we would expect a similarity in genetic output between the IF male and the most malnourished female, i.e. the 40% CR group. Performing this analysis, we noted a significant degree of identity between the significantly regulated KEGG signaling pathways between the male IF group and the female 40% CR group (Figure 15). It is also interesting to note that there was a hormonal link between these two groups, as they both possessed the highest circulating T/E ratios.",a56fca56-c290-4694-bfee-c62fd74aa50b
76,discussion13," Also linking the male IF group to the 40% CR female group, the 40% CR females showed the greatest gene∶pathway coherency amongst the female dietary paradigms (Figure 15). Similarly to the IF males, the 40% CR females had significantly lower plasma leptin levels than the ad libitum controls [1]. Conversely, though, the 40% CR females had similar growth hormone levels to controls. Corticosterone levels were significantly increased, reflecting the extreme stress the 40% CR diet placed on the female rats [1].  Interestingly, the 40% CR females showed a significant down-regulation in the gene Ccnd2 (cyclin D2), which is involved in the focal adhesion, JAK-STAT signaling, and cell cycle KEGG pathways. In the ovary, ccnd2 is expressed in the granulosa cells of the follicles and has been shown to play an important role in folliculogenesis.",8c79ec66-4875-485a-bec4-1e5fa53968d0
77,discussion14," Ccnd2 null mice have been shown to be infertile due to impaired granulosa cell proliferation in response to follicle stimulating hormone (Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)) and thus have small follicles with impaired oocyte release [32], [33]. Thus, this reduction in ccnd2 may be reflective of the impaired reproductive cycling ability of these rats. The 40% CR females showed a down-regulation in two genes involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which has been shown to play an important role in the maintenance of germline stem cells and follicle development in the drosophila ovary and testis [34]–[36]. The 40% CR females also showed a down-regulation in the vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) signaling pathway, which plays an essential role in angiogenesis and follicle development within the female reproductive tract [37]–[39]. The IF males also showed several interesting gene changes correlated to the KEGG pathway alterations.",dac83fd6-34df-44ca-a6dd-faa72ffad332
78,discussion15," There was a significant increase in the Fgf10 (fibroblast growth factor 10) gene, which is involved in the MAPK signaling pathway and has shown to play a role in the growth and development of several reproductive tissues [40]. Pcna (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), which is a part of the cell cycle KEGG pathway, was significantly down-regulated in the IF testes. Pcna is highly expressed in the sertoli cells of the testes, which function to nurture developing sperm cells during spermatogenesis [41] and is often used as a marker for cell proliferation.  Genes with differential expression patterns in the male and female rats, that were associated with fertility and reproductive tract morphology and function, were identified and then subjected to unbiased bioinformatic analysis. Estimation of the potential functional relevance of these genes was performed using the Jackson Lab Mouse Genome Database.",8fe3d482-5efd-4941-a192-56c01a330cf2
79,discussion16," This resource provides data correlating specific gene alterations and multiple physiological or pathophysiological outcomes (Table 3). In the IF males, various fertility related genes were up-regulated compared to the control males, such as Cugbp1 (Cug-binding protein), Gnpat (Glyceronephosphate o-acyltransferase), Smtn (Smoothelin), Fgf10 (Fibroblast growth factor 10). These genes play important roles in the maintenance of spermatogenesis and seminiferous tubule morphology [42]–[45]. In the 40% CR males, there was an up-regulation of Csda (Cold-shock domain protein A), Ube3a (Ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A), and Col4a1 (Collagen type IV). These genes are involved in maintaining spermatogenesis, seminiferous tubule structure, and fertility [23], [46], [47]. The up-regulation of these genes in the male IF and 40% CR animals suggests that these male animals are potentially maintaining or up-regulating their reproductive ability during periods of food scarcity.",da93d444-c454-416d-a4e5-775307b8efab
80,discussion17," In the 20% CR female animals, there was an up-regulation in Hsd17b4 (17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase IV), Gdf9 (Growth/differentiation factor 9), and Ccnd2 (Cyclin D2). These are important factors for maintaining ovarian morphology, folliculogenesis, and ovulation [48]–[50]. This suggests that the 20% CR females are potentially maintaining their reproductive ability, despite having reduced caloric input compared to the control females. The 40% CR females on the other hand, show a decrease in Ccnd2 expression. This could potentially suggest that ovulatory function is impaired in these severely calorie-restricted females and that they exhibit reduced reproductive ability compared to the control female rats.  10.1371/journal.pone.0004146.t003Table 3 Alterations in fertility-related genes in the male and female rats on the different dietary regimes.",7810acbf-02cb-459d-9845-a6e41ae2dd6c
