Participants were assessed 2 weeks before Ramadan and during the fourth week of Ramadan. On each occasion, participants completed a digital assessment of their cognitive performance and responded to the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)), the insomnia severity index (insomnia severity index (ISI)) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS)) questionnaires to assess sleep parameters.   Participants  Seventy-one older adults (aged > 60 years) agreed to participate in this study. After the verification of eligibility criteria, 63 subjects signed an informed consent prior to the start of the evaluation process (Figure 1).",d052a25f-6c20-478e-9808-8fd015a51b8a

4,methods5,"  Experimental design  The study was carried out in Tunisia during the 2022 Ramadan month from 02 April to 02 May in the Spring, when daily fasting started from ∼04:35 a.m. and ended at ∼6:45 p.m. (i.e., fasting duration of approximately ∼14 h). Participants were assessed twice: 2 weeks prior to Ramadan (non-fasting condition), in which the mean temperature was 15 ± 2.1n°C and the mean humidity 76 ± 10.2%, and during the fourth week of Ramadan’s fast (fasting condition) with 18 ± 1.0°C of mean temperature and 72 ± 8.3% of mean humidity.  All tests were conducted at the same time of day between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. for both groups before and during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) (before the break of fast). Participants had their last meal between 03:30 and 04:30 a.m. (i.e., Suhur), approximately 11–12 h before their assessment session.",fb1970e2-9618-4848-9a5f-7c8fb1c68731
5,methods6,"  The two sessions were conducted in a laboratory under the guidance of a qualified examiner who directed the evaluation process and provided subjects with instructions, cues, and information as needed. During Ramadan, participants (active group) continued to train in a fasted state (i.e., at the same time as before Ramadan (i.e., 5:30 p.m.) while the control group did not perform any type of physical training program. All subjects fasted during the entire month of Ramadan. No side effects (i.e., dizziness, hypoglycemia, headache) due to fasting were recorded in either group, suggesting the feasibility of the intervention.",25defe17-867e-4ef3-8f09-64e2bf69ed69
6,methods7,"  Both groups performed the same evaluation procedure; each session included a digital cognitive assessment battery (Neurotrack Technologies, Redwood City, CA), an assessment of sleep, sleepiness and insomnia based on validated Arabic version questionnaires including the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)) (45, 46), the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) (47, 48) and the insomnia severity index (insomnia severity index (ISI)) (49, 50).  Cognitive assessments  Cognitive function was assessed using the Neurotrack digital cognitive battery. Neurotrack’s cognitive assessments are brief, reliable measures that are based on paradigms previously shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in cognitive function (51–53). Given the assessments are designed in American English, the battery was adapted to fit our sample population.  First, the assessments and instructions were converted into an explanatory video with an Arabic language voice.",f4764e70-6efe-4af2-8a3b-68cc96447e02
7,methods8," Second, the output responses on the keyboard buttons were colored and translated to Arabic (e.g., yes, no, left, right, equal, unequal). The translation-back translation was carried out by two native Arabic speakers who were also fluent in English. To ensure understanding and feasibility, the translated versions of the assessments were pilot-tested with 15 older adults who were not included in the final sample. The pilot feedback was incorporated into the translated assessments, which were then re-piloted until no additional changes were required based on subsequent feedback. This digital cognitive battery was performed in translated Arabic version as in the recent study conducted by Boujelbane et al. (54).  This digital cognitive battery consists of six tests, each with its own measurement domain:  – Symbol Match, a digitized version of the traditional Digit Symbol Substitution test, is a task that assesses processing speed and executive functioning.",ad9168f6-294c-4d05-aad7-b68e43250b94
8,methods9," During this test, scores are calculated based on speed and accuracy.  – Item Price is a visual associative learning measure. Participants in a recognition trial are required to learn a succession of food/price pairs and then identify appropriately matched pairs. All of the items fall into the same semantic category (e.g., vegetables, and fruits). The accuracy of the answers determines the score.  – Arrow Match, based on the traditional Choice Reaction Time paradigm, is a test of attention and processing speed. Five arrows appear in the center of the screen, and participants are asked to identify/determine the direction of the middle arrow. Speed and accuracy are used to calculate scores.  – Path Points is an executive function and attention measure developed based on the Trail Making Test-Part B. Participants are instructed to alternately connect a succession of circles with numbers and letters (e.g., 1 connected to A, 2 connected to B, 3 connected to C, etc.).",ee426e83-f801-4529-a2c2-33039875b8aa
9,methods10," Speed determines the score.  – Light Reaction is an inhibition measure based on the go/no-go paradigm. A positive (i.e., green light) or negative (i.e., red light) stimulus will be shown to participants. In the case of a positive stimulus appearance, the participant must press a button. However, in the case of the appearance of a negative stimulus appears, subjects are instructed not to press the button. Speed and accuracy are used to calculate scores.  – Image Pairs is a test that assesses associative and recognition memory. The latter is assessed via eye-tracking movements (eye tracking movements (ETM)) (55). Behavioral responses are used to assess the associative memory component of the assessment. Briefly, a series of object pairs are presented to subjects during the familiarization phase. Then, during the test phase, subjects are asked to identify the previously observed pairs. Participants are instructed to look at and focus just on the new (i.e.",9e086f96-8e4b-4185-a1a9-1945f4960bea
10,methods11,", novel) image that has not previously been shown. The individual’s “novelty preference” is determined by the proportion of time spent viewing the new image relative to the overall gazing time. Accuracy is used to calculate scores.  The Epworth sleepiness scale  The subjective sleepiness was assessed using the Arabic validated version of the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) questionnaire (56). On a four-point scale, participants indicated how prone they are to doze in eight different daily situations (circumstances). Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) scores were interpreted as follows—0–5: lower than normal daytime sleepiness; 6–10: higher than normal daytime sleepiness; 11–12: mild excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)); 13–15: moderate excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and 16–24: severe excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) (57). In older men, the internal consistency is adequate (Cronbach’s α = 0.70) (58).",0a7fa554-1f38-400b-9989-ad580e772e55
11,methods12," For the construct validity, worse sleep on the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) is associated with greater sleepiness on the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) (r = 0.13; p < 0.001) (58).  The Pittsburg sleep quality index  The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) questionnaire (45), extensively validated in various populations and cultures (59), was used to assess sleep quality over the preceding month. The Arabic-validated version of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was utilized (46). The questionnaire includes 19 questions, each representing one of the seven sleep quality components: subjective sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep onset latency (sleep onset latency (SOL)), sleep disturbance, sleep efficiency, daytime dysfunction, and sleep medication intake (45). Global (total) Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores > 5 indicate poor sleep quality, whilst global Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores ≤ 5 indicate good sleep quality (45).",361cf7b1-8ae5-4417-aa14-a7be14bb8ae3

In addition, the internal consistency of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was 0.81 and the scales correlation score ranged from 0.48 to 0.71 (60).  Insomnia severity index  The Arabic-validated version of the insomnia severity index (ISI) questionnaire was utilized (50). The insomnia severity index (ISI) is a self-reported 7-item questionnaire that assesses the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia. insomnia severity index (ISI) scores range from 0 to 28. The total insomnia severity index (ISI) scores of 8 or higher indicates insomnia. The total score is interpreted as follows: no insomnia (0–7); sub-threshold insomnia (8–14); moderate insomnia (15–21); and severe insomnia (22–28). The internal consistency reliability equals 0.91 (49, 61). Regarding validity, insomnia severity index (ISI) shows a statistically significant positive correlation with Athens Insomnia scale-5 (r = 0.93) (49, 61).",054542a9-c804-4253-9798-86187ce7ff26
13,methods14,"  The Arabic version of the physical activity scale for the elderly  The physical activity scale for the elderly (PASE) is a brief, easy-to-score, reliable, and valid instrument used in epidemiologic investigations to assess PA in the elderly (62). Respondents are asked to report the number of days per week in which the activity was performed, as well as the number of hours per day spent on leisure activity items. physical activity scale for the elderly (PASE) scores are calculated from weights and frequency values assigned to each of the 12 types of activity. The internal consistency of the physical activity scale for the elderly (physical activity scale for the elderly (PASE)-A) components is good (Cronbach’s α 0.70–0.75), and the reliability of the components is excellent (ICC2,10.90–0.98) (63).

The variation (Δ) recorded from before Ramadan session to during Ramadan session is calculated as follows: Δ = During Ramadan – Before Ramadan. The percentage of variation (Δ%) recorded from before Ramadan session to during Ramadan session is calculated by the following formula: Δ% = (Δ/Before Ramadan) × 100. The normality of the distributions was tested by the Shapiro-Wilks test.  Pearson’s chi-squared test was used to compare the demographic baseline characteristics of the participants including gender, education level, and health status of the two groups. Because the age and the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) were not normally distributed, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test was used.",0ba995e1-ae3d-45db-94e9-192455a15c6a

Therefore, a two-way mixed analysis of variance (a priori for repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)) was applied 2 groups (Sedentary vs. Active) × 2 Ramadan (Before Ramadan vs. During Ramadan) for these variables. When the a priori for repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant interaction, pairwise comparison is carried out by a Bonferroni post-hoc test, otherwise by an independent or paired Student’s t-test.  For other parameters where normality is not verified, non-parametric tests are used as follows: Wilcoxon test was made for the comparison from before to during Ramadan for each group and the Mann-Whitney U-test is carried out for the comparison between the means of the two groups, before Ramadan, during Ramadan and the Δ variation.",8e410c18-0864-4df1-a18c-a50c4b4d58bc

To determine the meaningfulness of significant findings for the a priori for repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) Group × Ramadan interaction, effect sizes (ES) were calculated as partial eta-squared ηp2 (64, 65). Small, moderate, and large ES are represented by ηp2 values of 0.01, 0.06, and 0.14, respectively (65). Furthermore, the magnitude of the change in score was determined using Cohen’s d (66), and it was interpreted using the following criteria: 0.2 (small), 0.5 (moderate), and 0.8 (large).

Before Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF), significant differences in questionnaires baseline scores including Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), insomnia severity index (ISI), and physical activity scale for the elderly (PASE) as well as for some cognitive function domains (i.e., inhibition and processing speed) were reported. This may be explained by the physical training effects in the active group. Previous reports suggest a beneficial role of chronic training schedule on inhibitory function (68, 69), processing speed (70), insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and sleep quality (71, 72).",733dae84-4385-47d8-98ee-a09e82ba7031

However, the control group showed a significant decline in associative learning from before to during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF), unlike other cognitive domains which remained unchanged overtime period. These findings partially verified our first hypothesis. Furthermore, we observed an overall deterioration of sleep quality and an increase in daytime sleepiness for both groups. The reported scores of Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) confirmed both groups suffered from poor sleep quality, which confirmed our second hypothesis.",1c9d94c1-8c18-4f64-b636-2062890a2e5b
28,discussion2,"  The average overall Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) score (Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) score ≥ 5) recorded before and during Ramadan is indicative of poor sleep quality (43, 73), which could be associated with volume loss in several hippocampal subfields triggered by the aging process (74). The greater increase in the global Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) score during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) (Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) score > 8) (75) for the control group suggests a worsened sleep quality and thus potential depressive syndrome (76). Based on the results of a recent systematic review (77), it is likely that maintaining a moderate intensity PA during Ramadan could have reduced the negative effect of Ramadan on sleep quality. Furthermore, several studies have shown exercise may modulate the circadian rhythm by serving as a time cue, modifying the phase of a molecular clock in peripheral tissues (78–80).",e055f4e5-29f7-4347-9716-7a7b184c1e44
29,discussion3," More precisely, endurance and resistance exercise may stimulate the expression of core molecular clock genes, through the influence on exercise-sensitive genes such as AMPK, HIF-1α, and PGC1α. Increased activation of AMPK modifies the stability of Per and Cry, modulating the expression of clock genes (78–81). Moreover, adopting PA can potentially resynchronize peripheral muscle and vascular clock misalignment, which could improve vascular health and, consequently, skeletal muscle function (82).  Regarding Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) components, nocturnal sleep duration, which is a critical element in assessing the restorative effects of sleep (83), decreased more in the control group (<7 h/night) by ∼1 h during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF), as older adults require about the same amount of sleep as all adults (i.e., 7–9 h/night) (84).",22b61e8d-3701-4d6c-8c29-e9c40b15ee63
30,discussion4," The decrease in nocturnal sleep duration was previously reported during Ramadan (30, 85) and could be explained by the occurrence of several lifestyle changes in nocturnal and diurnal activities (i.e., zeitgeber factors), such as rising early for the Suhur meal and engaging in more social activities after the break of fast (e.g., Quran reading groups, social gatherings, shopping, prayers) (30, 86, 87). Furthermore, the greater than normal food consumption at night as well as eating close to bedtime could have decreased nocturnal sleep duration by negatively affecting circadian rhythm and hormone excretion (88, 89).  Sleep disturbances increased significantly in both groups during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF).",bae51ca5-5462-43cf-8702-c9ed6f2d41b1
31,discussion5," Nocturnal urination is known as a potential cause of sleep disturbances in the elderly (90), and increased water intake after the break of fast during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) could have exacerbated the effect of nocturnal urination on sleep disturbances. Additionally, rising early for the Suhur and prayers could explain, at least in part, the previous finding.  sleep onset latency (SOL), another component of Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), increased in both groups. Additionally, average sleep onset latency (SOL) values reported during Ramadan in the two groups were higher than the cut-off of 20 min indicative of usual sleep onset latency (SOL) (91), suggesting our participants have difficulty initiating sleep during Ramadan. The increased exposure to evening light during Ramadan (e.g., family commitment, watching TV programs, shopping) could have prolonged subsequent sleep onset latency (SOL) (i.e., taking longer to fall asleep during Ramadan) in both groups.",37c2239b-a7d2-48cb-94c2-42f9ec302ee8
32,discussion6," As a result of sleep impairment, daytime dysfunction increased during Ramadan in the two groups; this may increase the loss of daily structure during Ramadan (92).  Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) scores increased during Ramadan in the two groups. However, it is worth mentioning that the average Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score recorded in the sedentary group is indicative of higher than normal daytime sleepiness, whilst daytime sleepiness in the active group is lower than normal. The increase in daytime sleepiness could be explained by sleep insufficiency during Ramadan, as previously reported by Faris et al. (30). In this context, a comparable increase in daytime sleepiness levels during Ramadan was previously reported by the systematic review and meta-analysis of Faris et al. (30). Chasens et al. (93) reported daytime sleepiness in older adults is negatively associated with some measures of PA.",d01e8828-5155-4023-b448-74bf245ca122
33,discussion7," It appears practicing PA during Ramadan may explain lower Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) scores observed in the active compared to the sedentary group. Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) explaining the relationship between daytime sleepiness and PA activity level is not fully understood.  Despite the increase in insomnia severity index (ISI) total scores in both groups from before Ramadan to during Ramadan, it remained clinically non-significant (i.e., total insomnia severity index (ISI) score < 7), and this finding could be related to the inexistence of very high mean age in both groups (i.e., mean age < 65 years). Some previous studies suggest the rise of insomnia severity problems is associated with getting old and that about 12–25% of individuals aged more than 65 years old suffer from insomnia problems (94, 95).  The deterioration of sleep-wake patterns may lead to a subsequent decrease in cognitive function during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) in both groups.",4515f4f9-6b8a-4ed7-93ea-33fee59b7a72
34,discussion8," The digital cognitive assessment battery revealed enhancements in several cognitive domains, in the active elderly group compared to the control group. These improvements may be attributed to the effects of regular PA, combined with intermittent fasting.  Associative learning is defined as, “learning about the connection between two disparate stimuli” (96). There are not yet any studies investigating the effects of Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) on associative learning, but we suggest the performance decrease in the control group could be attributed to the aging process, which is related to dysfunction in dopamine receptors and transmitter substances (97, 98). This may lead to the disruption in dopamine receptor stimulation levels in the prefrontal cortex, which may worsen the balance of cognitive stability and flexibility (99), consequently disturbing associative learning modulation (100).",99f511ba-5887-4dad-9a49-a9f05df684aa
35,discussion9," Future investigations based on clinical data regarding the dopamine pathways and their interactions with associative learning for elderly individuals are warranted. Moreover, the dysfunction of nitric oxide (NO) activity in the brain due to the aging process may also explain the learning impairment (101–103). However, regular PA reshapes the system balance, leading to the regulation of dopamine levels in the brain and the availability of more dopamine receptors (104), as well as increasing the production of NO release from endothelial cells, favoring vascular function and decreasing NO from inducible NO synthase in the brain (103, 105, 106), potentially reducing the harmful effect of aging. This is evident for active elderly who maintain the associative learning level during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF).  Attention refers to the collection of adapted brain functions that enable effective and adaptive behavioral selection (107).",0ffc42bb-3cdd-4bd5-a2ef-6df09221e8ef
36,discussion10," According to the BOLD-fMRI research, compensatory mechanisms exist to help attention and focus and inhibit extraneous mental processes induced by sleep deprivation, which may mitigate some of their adverse effects and add flexibility in tasks that deserve attention and vigilance (108–110). Despite the sleep deterioration observed in the sedentary group during Ramadan, attention scores increased. This may be explained by the compensatory mechanisms enabling attention improvement during Ramadan. It should be acknowledged attention scores increased in the active group, but with a higher effect size (i.e., d = 0.60) compared to that of the sedentary group (i.e., d = 0.49) and this highlights the role of continuous PA in potentially enhancing attention in the elderly (111, 112).  Furthermore, our results are in accordance with the study of Tian et al. (42), which revealed a beneficial effect of Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) on visual attention for Muslim athletes.",e131ea64-1cc0-4962-aef7-c05862a46244
37,discussion11," However, other studies revealed a significant decline in attentional performance induced by Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) in sedentary individuals (88, 113, 114).  For executive function, which is defined as a set of mental aptitudes that incorporate working memory, adaptable reasoning, and self-control (115), physically active older adults performed better during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) compared to sedentary participants who did not record a change from before to during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF). This stagnation in the control group is in concert with the findings of Harder-Lauridsen et al. (116), who revealed no effects of intermittent fasting on executive function. Furthermore, the significant increase of executive function values for the active group reinforces existing literature suggesting regular physical exercise may buffer the impacts of aging on cognitive decrements, especially with regard to executive function (117–119).",5e3ad6de-7a14-4f9e-9c1d-7beeecca8d7c
38,discussion12," Moreover, the recent meta-analysis of Xiong et al. (120) confirmed the beneficial effects of regular physical activities for improving cognitive flexibility, working memory, and inhibitory control of executive function in cognitively healthy older adults.  Inhibitory control or inhibition refers to the ability to suppress or control impulsive (or instinctive) responses and produce replies by employing attention and logic (121). In this context, inferior inhibitory control shown in the control group, compared to physically active elderly before and during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF), may explain the decrease of sleep efficiency for sedentary participants (122). Ghayour Najafabadi et al. (25) showed no adverse effects of Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) on inhibitory performance in female athletes; thereby we suggest that regular exercise may preserve inhibitory control, exhibited by faster response speeds during inhibition tasks.",2cd7aa6f-fb0d-48e3-9963-1a7df27d06ad
39,discussion13," This is related to greater productivity of neural circuits (123), suggesting the synthesis of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a vital component underlying the impact of PA on brain structure and capacities evidently on inhibitory function (124).  Processing speed, which reflects the amount of time needed to react to and/or process information to perform an intellectual task (125), remained unchanged from before to during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) for both groups. Our results are contradictory to those of Tian et al. (42). This latter showed a significant effect of Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) on psychomotor function in athletes who had poorer scores in the afternoon (i.e., at 16:00 h) than morning (i.e., at 09:00 h) (42), which could explain the reason we found no significant changes in the active group since our testing was performed in the afternoon.",605abcc1-497a-4e8b-a69e-e986d3cf1cd6
40,discussion14," Additionally, higher processing speed values recorded before and during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) in the active group may explain the positive effects of PA training on processing speed (126). Moreover, the decrease, even though non-significant, shown in the control group between before to during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF), may be attributed to decreased integrity of the cerebral white matter associated to the aging process (127). Reducing this decline is important as it may cause several problems in daily life. In this context, decreases in processing speed are the strongest indicator of driving cessation in older adults (128).  To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to assess memory function based on eye tracking in older adults during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF).",e1a3eb60-8856-44e8-b2ca-a78a309b0c96
41,discussion15," Novelty preference score is an operation of recognition memory based on eye tracking movements (ETM) which is the capacity to identify already experienced objects (129), in addition to associative memory which is defined as the capacity to learn and retain the connection between unrelated items. Our results revealed a better increase during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) for active subjects compared to sedentary older adults. Similar to this unchanged value in the control group, Doniger et al. (130) found no evidence of a substantial impact of fasting (i.e., religious orthodox Jewish day of fast) on verbal recognition memory performance based on computerized cognitive assessment for normal individuals. However, a recent study conducted by Dias et al. (131) affirmed the protentional effects of intermittent fasting including several neurological modifications on memory consolidation.",de3e312c-f240-4d9d-adbc-dcd5f4b6c174
42,discussion16,"  Furthermore, the continuous physical training program based on several tactical schemes and combinations of team sport and repetitive movements on circuit training, as in our research, could have positively consolidated and strengthened memory functions in elder adults (132–134).  Limitations  Despite the novelty of our study, some limitations should be acknowledged and addressed in future investigations. First, we did not evaluate sleep quality and daytime sleepiness using objective measurements (e.g., actigraphy, polysomnography, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test). Although there is disagreement about what exactly constitutes excellent sleep, sleep quality was previously described as a subjective perception (135). Interestingly, the used questionnaires include a standardized scoring strategy which seems to offer more prominent reliability and reproducibility in further investigations.",ad959cd3-21bf-4c2c-8bd3-b3de1aa4c712
43,discussion17," The second issue is that the Neurotrack battery’s cultural adaptation did not cover all of the assessments’ components (e.g., the items on display when taking the exam). It is worth noting that for adapting cognitive assessments to different cultural contexts, there are currently no established standards guidelines, or criteria (136). Nevertheless, an exact transcribing methodology was performed to consider any potential cultural context-related performance bias. In this regard, methodological variations and the absence of sensitive computerized neuropsychological tools (i.e., the lack of objective assessment) in some studies may be to blame for the contradictory results.",4cf49ed0-c248-4d35-8974-09c63177f30d
44,discussion18," Third, the evident decrease in physical activity scale for the elderly (PASE) scores in both groups could not be due to the decline of PA level, specifically for the active group, since coaches prioritize maintenance during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) to the same duration and intensity in training sessions as before Ramadan month. This energy expenditure decline may be attributed to the decrease in daily life behaviors (e.g., gardening). In this regard, raising these daily activities to normal rates is recommended. Fourth, we did not investigate hydration status, nutritional intake, and glycemia before and during Ramadan as well as in pre-dawn meal and when breaking fast, despite the existence of several studies in the elderly population confirming the strong relationship between hypohydration, nutrition and poor cognitive performance (137–142), as well as between glycemic control and cognitive functions (143, 144).",a8f24613-239e-41e2-975e-1937cb7d4129
45,discussion19," More rigorous studies investigating these parameters before and during overall Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) are needed. Other factors such as environmental variables (e.g., noise and number of the household in the same house), as well as the emotional and psychological status (e.g., satisfaction, depression), may have influenced the results. Therefore, these confounding factors should be assessed/controlled during future investigations. Furthermore, the results of our study pertain only to older adults. Muslim and could not be generalized to non-Muslim older adults given that intermittent fasting performed by our participants is of a religious type. More empirical studies with largest number of participants in non-Muslim countries should be investigated. Moreover, experimental investigations based on clinical data (e.g.",37614194-ccf9-49cf-a4c3-55fd5bde3038
46,discussion20,", biochemical and cardiometabolic parameters) are warranted to better understand the mechanisms, and objectively discuss the variation in the outcomes of interests in order to reach more definitive conclusions.  Conclusion  Ramadan observance worsened sleep quality and increased daytime sleepiness in both groups; however, this was more prominent in the control group. Likewise, more pronounced adverse impacts on cognitive functions were recorded for inactive subjects compared to active older adults. Therefore, continuous PA practice during the month of Ramadan may counteract the potential negative effect of Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) on sleep and cognitive performance.
