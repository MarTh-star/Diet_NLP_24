28,discussion0," Human physiology is significantly impacted by trillions of gut microbiota having nine million non-redundant genes (Hooper and Gordon, 2001; Yang et al., 2009). Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome causes a variety of metabolic disorders that leads to chronic inflammations which are depicted by overweight and obesity as phenotypic outcomes . Body weight is a physical indicator of metabolic diseases . Different strategies like the use of probiotics (Fooks and Gibson, 2002), prebiotics, fecal transplantation , and the use of antibiotics are being tried to restore the gut microbiota to normal. In this context, fasting is considered an ancient therapy (Handschin, 2016). Numerous research studies find out that IF mostly results in weight loss and improvement of blood profile .  In this study, it was found that IF has an impact on body mass indexes, blood lipid profiles, and gut microbial profiles.",f879800a-9c2d-4fa6-92f7-388a4e0423c9

Surprisingly, weight increase was observed in underweight women. These results show that this IF regimen tends to normalize the total body mass without its unwarranted depletion in healthy individuals. Reduction of body weight by IF has been reported (Adlouni et al., 1997; Ley et al., 2006; Kul et al., 2014); however, normalization of body weight is reported for the first time. The number of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus increased in all five groups, and it is well established that reduced body weight is linked to an increasing trend in gut microbial diversity, and overweight or obesity is linked to reduced gut bacterial diversity .",2f16f067-f1a7-4118-83b2-5e87ae635dcc
30,discussion2," In our study, the weight reduction was found linked to an increasing trend in bacterial diversity, while a decreasing trend in bacterial diversity was observed especially in women those gained weights. In an earlier report, the impact of IF on a female subject showed an increase in weight was due to the use of energy-dense diets and less physical activities during the fasting days . However, the impact of IF is not gender-specific, when tested in the mice model . Abdelgadir in 2015 conducted a study on three different nations and reported that people using normal diets with physical activities have improved lipid profiles after IF while people eating more or energy-rich diets or doing no or limited physical activities have no change in their lipid profile at the end of study .

It was also observed that the IF trial lowered the level of total cholesterol but retained it in the normal recommended range (<200 mg/dl). The level of triglycerides decreased in 24/31 male volunteers while increased in 5/31 male volunteers. In the same way, the level of triglycerides is retained in the normal range (< 150 mg/dl). The level of low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoproteins (LDL)) decreased in 20/31 male volunteers and increased in 6/31 male volunteers in the same recommended ranges of <100 mg/dl.",20b9135e-6b8e-421a-a0b2-aec526ed1ea9
32,discussion4," The level of high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) increased in 24/31 and decreased in 3/31 male volunteers but in the normal range (>40 mg/dl), and the level of very low-density lipoproteins decreased in 22/31 male volunteers and increased in 6/31 male volunteers. The total cholesterol level decreased in all female volunteers. The total triglycerides decreased in 11/14 female volunteers and increased only in three volunteers, but within the normal recommended range, low-density lipoproteins decreased in 12/14 female volunteers, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) increased in 13/14 female volunteers. IF lowered total aerobic bacterial count in all the male and female volunteers when checked through conventional culturing methods. The number of total Lactococcus and total Lactobacillus, when assessed through culturing method, seen increased at the end of the IF trial in both male and female volunteers.",3f6fc3e7-4b9e-46ea-b069-b535b2f2d982
33,discussion5,"  Recently, a study established the link between gut bacterial diversity and lipid blood profile, which showed that fasting sugar level, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoproteins are associated with reduced gut bacterial diversity as compared to the control cohort . Another study conducted on Finnish-men also showed that elevated blood lipids are associated with increased gut bacterial diversity . Yang et al. (2017), in 2017, conducted a study on pigs, which showed that increased blood lipid levels are associated with altered bacterial diversity while Lactobacillus is negatively correlated with the blood lipid profile .",54922f2e-bc3f-4d8f-9346-9010d31349c1
34,discussion6," The in vitro cholesterol assimilation activity of gut microbiota isolated from healthy individuals has been confirmed by different researchers recently, and the presence of bile salt hydrolase bsh genes is reported in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, mostly used for cholesterol assimilation activities (Pereira and Gibson, 2002; Begley et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2009, 2013). These bacteria are known for anti-inflammatory activities, and inulin is the key component that favorably increases the number of Bifidobacteria spp (de Souza et al., 2017). These findings favored our results where all the samples carried Lactobacillus spp while their lipid profile was also positively improved. It has been demonstrated that overweight individuals carry a high microbial load in their intestines when compared with normal ones . Another study showed that increased bacterial richness is associated with parasite-positive guts .",3b1b981c-97bb-4245-9ec9-2420eacd651d
35,discussion7," It was explained by Maine Margo that increased diversity in the intestine is considered a healthy flora. They have more potential to degrade and metabolize diverse nutrient components (Maine and Kelly, 2016). Therefore, the reduction in bacterial richness and increase in diversity confirm a positive alteration in the intestinal bacteria. Changes were seen in the percentages of bacterial phylum at the end of the study (Figure 8). Normal weight male group had a higher percentage of Proteobacteria 73.28% which decreased to 1.56% by intermittent fasting. Firmicutes were initially 26% while increased to 58% making the highest portion of all the phylum at the end of the study. Increase in Actinobacteria from 0.19 to 37.14% was observed at the end of the study. Male underweighted group before IF had the highest Firmicutes of 69.95% and later decreased to 40.42%. The Actinobacteria also reduced from 19.72 to 6.43%, while Proteobacteria increased from 0.95 to 24.78%, Bacteroides from 8.",be5d1ffb-915a-4d41-9670-44d9b31270c0
36,discussion8,"87 to 19.81%, and Verrucomirobia from 0.21 to 7.98% at the end of the study. In female underweighted group, Firmicutes and Bacteroides decreased from 63.18 to 38.55% and 17.41 to 5.43%, respectively, while Proteobacteria increased from 5.52 to 41.96% and Actinobacteria from 6.90 to 13.97% at the end of the study. Female overweight/obese group before IF carried high Firmicutes than Bacteroides and low Proteobacteria. At the end of the study, Firmicutes and Bacteriodes were decreased and Proteobacteria was increased up to 11%. In female normal group, no significant changes at phylum level were observed. It has been concluded that too high and too low Proteobacteria are signs of dysbiosis. A minor percentage of Proteobacteria (<12%) is known healthy one at phylum level .

Double hierarchical dendrogram shows the bacterial distribution.",a4f0c1f3-f8cf-4862-9577-75e98bc473f5
37,discussion9," The bacterial phylogenetic tree was calculated using the neighbor-joining method, and the relationship among samples was determined by Bray–Curtis distance and the complete clustering method. The heatmap plot depicts the relative percentage of each bacterial phylum (variables clustering on the vertical axis) within each sample group (horizon-axis clustering). The relative values for bacterial phylum are indicated by the color intensity with the legend indicated at the bottom of the figure.  At the genera level, before IF, it was seen that the normal-weighted male group had a high percentage of Pseudomonas triavilis, that is, 69%. This bacterium is isolated from grasses and is kept in risk group one, and it may cause infection in humans . Later, at the end of the study, it decreased to 0.04%. The Brevibacillus limnophilus was in the second number (4%) followed by Bacillus spp.",8dbf42e5-849e-4f77-84d0-231a5f740974
38,discussion10," At the end of the study, the number of Ruminococcus flavefaciens increased to 28%, Bifidobacterium adolescentis to 28%, and Lactobacillus rumins to 9%. A study conducted by Cucchi et al. (2013) showed that the fecal material of vegetarians has a high number of Ruminococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacteria sp. Participants consumed a vegetable-rich diet during the study period. The Ruminococcus flavefaciens are fiber digesting bacteria mainly involved in interactive digestion and acquisition of the nutrients in the intestine . Ejtahed et al. (2012), investigated and found that increase in the number of Bifidobacterium is responsible for blood cholesterol lowering. In another study the effect of energy restriction on body weight and gut microbiota was evaluated. It was concluded that an increase in the number of Bifidobacterium sp and lactobacillus spp is associated with weight loss .",dc9b7623-59e6-49e5-ada9-b01b1bfae03d
39,discussion11,"  A normal-weighted male group at the end of the IF study had 5% Catenibacterium mitsoukai of the total bacterial population. This species is heterofermentative and has a broad range of substrate utilization, thus providing more nutrients to their host (Kageyama and Benno, 2000). Before IF, there were no detectable species of Collinsella aerofaciens, but later on, it was observed that they make up 2% of all the total bacterial population present in the gut. The Collinsella aerofaciens was associated with the prevention and cure of irritable bowel diseases . This group carried 2% Subdoligranulum spp. These species have been used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Wang and Jia, 2016). Less number of Dorea spp was observed, and it is known that an increased number of Dorea spp can contribute to the development of irritable bowel disease (Rajilić-Stojanović et al., 2015).",ddabbb70-a000-4b07-8504-daa4a8f6a36f
40,discussion12," These findings present an improvement in the health status of the intestine and the whole host. In the male underweighted group, evenness and bacterial diversity were increased after the trial. It carried more percentage of Campylobacter spp, that is, 16% of the total bacterial population. Studies have shown that Campylobacter spp are normally present in animals and poultry, and their count goes high in warmer months. Not all Campylobacter spp are pathogenic to humans . The Campylobacter spp. have shown the colonization of the large intestine (Saint-Cyr et al., 2016). This study was performed in warmer months, while the volunteers were consuming poultry meat as a part of their routine diet. Hence, the high concentration of Campylobacter sp in the fecal samples of the volunteer’s cohort might be the competitive exclusion of these undesired microorganisms by the intestinal flora. The Megasphaera elsdenii were 5% of the total bacterial population.",4aaffb7d-11a1-4d0e-89cd-cf93e14fc926
41,discussion13," This bacterium is responsible for the treatment of metabolic acidosis . The Oscillospira spp. were decreased in the groups. According to a study, a decrease in Oscillospira spp is considered anti-obesity signature bacteria . Before IF, overweight/obese female group carried a high number of Roseburia spp (17%) and Prevotell copri (16%). At the end of IF, they were decreased to 1 and 8%, respectively. Increased Roseburia spp. are associated with gall stone formation (Tamanai-Shacoori et al., 2017), while increased Prevotella copri is associated with autoimmune diseases (Campbell, 2014).  Strength of the study: Blood lipid profile was improved and modulated gut microbiota even though the volunteers were taking their ad libitum diets during the eating windows of the experiment and were living their routine life.",080db0d1-b01d-4a80-8b13-6bf9109359ba
42,discussion14," No dietary or living habits were advised to be changed or restricted, but, in many gut modulation studies, experimental subjects are passed through dietary restriction or changing living styles. Recently, a study conducted on a mice model for the improvement of blood lipid profile and modulation of gut microbiota kept the experimental mice restricted to a diet having the main portion of isoquercetin and inulin . In another study, antibiotics were administered in the diet for the improvement of blood lipid profile and modulation of gut microbiota . We have conducted our experimental trial on the human population, and it reflects the actual outcome and can be used as a reference for further studies, while in many cases, such studies are performed on mice model. There is a difference in the gut microbiota of humans and mice which affects the outcome of any experimental trial.",cd26f8e7-63c5-4e4c-a045-55abfa95041e
43,discussion15," Recently, the gut microbiota of mice and humans was compared using large datasets, and it was found that both the gut microbiota are similar at phylum level but have large variations at the species level . The core microbiota of mice is small, while the core of human gut microbiota is large . It was found that 85% of genera that are present in mice are not present in humans , while, when compared at the gene level, only 4% of genes were found in mice microbiota . The gut microbiota of mice can be changed by the diet within 1 week, while human gut microbiota does not change so quickly (Wang and Jia, 2016). The difference between the results of women and men may be due to the fasting days, and women were exempted to fast during their menstrual cycle. The number of fasting days is not defined yet.",765df64c-3cc5-4065-a68e-f9d92d14248a
