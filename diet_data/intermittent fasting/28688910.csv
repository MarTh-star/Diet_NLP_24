0,methods0," Animals  C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). Eight‐week‐old male mice were group‐housed (4 mice per 470‐cm2 cage) in an air‐conditioned room (24 °C) kept on a 12‐h dark/light (8 pm–8 am) cycle, and allowed free access to water and a CE‐2 standard dry rodent diet (Clea Japan, Tokyo, Japan). In fasting experiments, mice were deprived of the diet for 1 or 2 days between 2 pm and 2 pm (hereinafter referred to as F1 and F2 mice, respectively). Ad libitum‐fed (AL) mice were analyzed as controls. After anesthetization by isoflurane inhalation, blood was collected through the heart and the liver, kidney, thymus, spleen, brain, and testis were quickly dissected out, snap‐frozen by liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. All animal procedures conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition published by the US National Research Council, and were approved by the Animal Care Committees of Keio University (No.",191788d9-239a-4365-97e8-3271b53c8764

Homogenates were centrifuged at 16 000 g for 5 min at 4 °C, and then, the supernatants were centrifuged at 20 000 g for 25 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the resultant supernatants were determined using a Bio‐Rad Protein Assay and bovine serum albumin as a standard. All reagents used in this study were of analytical grades from Wako (Tokyo, Japan) or Sigma‐Aldrich unless otherwise noted. 2D DIGE was performed as described previously 12, 13, 14. Twenty‐five μg of protein (adjusted to pH 8.5 by adding 40 mm Tris/HCl [pH 8.5]) was labeled with 200 pmol of CyDye (Cy2, Cy3, or Cy5 minimal dye fluor [GE Healthcare]) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark.",dfdf0613-79ba-457d-991d-9feb7017e8e3

The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 μL of 10 mm lysine. Labeled samples were mixed, and DTT and immobilized pH gradient (immobilized pH gradient (IPG)) buffer (final 1% each) were added for 10 min at 4 °C in the dark.

The strips were sealed on the top of 12.5% PAGE gels (140 × 140 × 1 mm; Perfect NT Gel S from DRC, Tokyo, Japan) using 0.5% low‐melting‐point agarose in Tris/glycine electrophoresis buffer. The second dimension of protein separation was performed at a constant 200 V using an ERICA‐S high‐speed electrophoresis system (DRC). A total of four gels (for the comparisons between AL (n = 4) and F2 (n = 4)) were scanned at once for Cy2/Cy3/Cy5 fluorescence using a Typhoon Trio image scanner (GE Healthcare), and obtained images were integratively analyzed using DeCyder 2D ver. 6.5 differential analysis software (GE Healthcare).",6022dd20-5f83-4815-8d1d-26f51c94c6a3
5,methods5,"  Silver staining  For protein identification using MALDI‐TOFMS, each tissue homogenate sample (100–150 μg) was subjected to 2D PAGE (mentioned above) without CyDye labeling. To get better resolutions, some samples were separated on larger 2D systems using longer strips (24 cm, pH 3–10 NL [nonlinear]) and larger PAGE gels (257 × 200 × 1 mm; Perfect NT Gel W from DRC). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained using a Silver Stain MS Kit (Wako).  MALDI‐TOFMS analysis of trypsin digests  Gel pieces were excised from silver‐stained gels, destained with a mixture of destaining solutions A and B (Wako), washed twice with deionized water and four times with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3):acetonitrile (1 : 1), dehydrated once with acetonitrile, twice alternately rehydrated with 100 mm NH4HCO3 and dehydrated with acetonitrile, and dried by vacuum centrifugation.

10,results0," Protein expression changes in the liver  We first estimated the duration required to obtain organ proteomic responses by fasting using serum biochemistry. One‐day (water‐only) fasting was sufficient to maintain minimal levels of glucose, insulin, C‐peptide 2, leptin, and resistin; the levels generally matched those in F2 mice, but, in contrast, the accumulation of ketone bodies and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) was much more apparent in F2 mice (Fig. 1). Our exploratory 2D DIGE analyses did not find apparent alterations in hepatic protein expression in F1 mice (data not shown), and additional (e.g., 3‐day) fasting (that may cause acute > 25% body weight loss) was not allowed for ethical reasons in our university. Therefore, we investigated global protein expression in various mouse organs after 2‐day fasting.

23,discussion0," This study investigated global protein expression changes in six major mouse organs upon 2‐day fasting. After 1‐ or 2‐day fasting, blood levels of glucose, insulin, and C‐peptide 2 (another component of proinsulin [insulin + C‐peptide 2] that has its own physiological properties 25) were significantly reduced compared with the levels in AL mice (67.1%, 61.3%, and 66.3%, respectively [Fig. 1]). Moreover, the levels of two adipose‐derived peptide hormones, leptin (the pleiotropic hormone of satiation signals/energy expenditure 26, 27) and resistin (the hormone that may ‘resist’ insulin actions 28), were decreased to the same extent in F1 and F2 mice (Fig. 1). In contrast, ketone bodies and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) became more accumulated in F2 mice (Fig. 1). High accumulation of ketone bodies may reflect a progressive systemic energy shift from glucose to ketone bodies.",9152a984-8965-4189-bff4-e1e5c8fbccdd
24,discussion1," gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) is a polypeptide inhibitor of gastric acid secretion and acts as an affective promotor of insulin secretion 29; therefore, its elevation could be a delayed compensatory action against low plasma levels of insulin (Fig. 1). These data indicated somewhat altered systemic conditions between F1 and F2 mice. We identified 72, 26, 14, and 32 proteins that were significantly up‐ or downregulated in the liver, thymus, spleen, and kidney of F2 mice, respectively, but significant expression changes were not found in F1 mice (data not shown).  Previous studies demonstrated the pivotal roles of PPARα in mediating adaptive responses to fasting in the liver (Fig.",153e4688-2770-43e3-ad54-abc48ffc2983
25,discussion2," 2C and Table S2 [Sheet A]), as observed in the present study; PPARα positively regulates gluconeogenesis, peroxisomal/mitochondrial β‐oxidation, fatty acid transport, and ketogenesis and also negatively regulates glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, and inflammation, by binding to specific nucleotide sequences known as peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes 23, 24. PPARα‐knockout mice have been shown to display several dysregulated responses such as severe hypoglycemia, hypoketonemia, elevated plasma free fatty acid levels, and fatty liver upon fasting 4, 5. Accordingly, we found hepatic upregulation of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis (Pck1 and Pc), lipid β‐oxidation (Acox1), ketogenesis (Hmgcs2), and downregulation of the enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis (Fasn) and glycogenolysis (Pygl) (Fig. 2C, Table 1, and Table S1 [Sheet A]).",775d0999-2851-46f9-afb0-09064d84b383
26,discussion3," Although all genes encoding these ‘upregulated’ proteins have been shown to contain PPREs in their promoter regions 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and thus can be activated directly by ligand‐bound PPARα, the suppression of Fasn and Pygl expression could be caused by a secondary mechanism such as low plasma levels of insulin 35, 36.  PPARα is activated by both endogenous and synthetic ligands; the former includes long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and eicosanoids such as leukotriene B4 and the latter includes fibrates such as fenofibrate, bezafibrate, and clinofibrate, the drugs for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia 24. Endogenous ligand activation of PPARα could occur in other PPARα‐expressing organs such as kidney and heart 37 because large amounts of free fatty acids enter the systemic circulation during fasting.",0a5fa571-5719-4e2f-94ee-eafc0b05156a
27,discussion4," Indeed, we found PPARα regulation of nine proteins in the kidney of F2 mice (Fig 3C and Table S2 [Sheet B]) although the regulatory genes and directions were not necessarily identical to the liver (Figs. 2C and 3C). The upstream regulator analysis listed NR1I2 and PPARγ as the second and third highest scoring transcriptional regulators, respectively, but their P‐values were much (7–8 orders) higher than PPARα (Fig. 2C and Table S2 [Sheet A]). Expression of PPARγ was rather restricted to adipose tissue and the immune systems, and its hepatic expression was shown to be extremely low compared with PPARα in adult rats 37.  The highest scoring regulator in the kidney of F2 mice was ATF6, which could regulate the expression of five proteins (Fig. 3C): Calr, Hsp90b1, Pck1 (spot 1), Acox1 (spot 3), and Cpt2 (carnitine O‐palmitoyltransferase 2, mitochondrial; spot 6; an enzyme involved in acyl transfer across the mitochondrial inner membrane for β‐oxidation in the matrix) (Fig.",235fde17-2c4d-42a5-bcda-3048208bd210
28,discussion5," 3A,B, Table 2, and Table S2 [Sheet B]). Although the upregulation of Pck1/Acox1/Cpt2 was common between liver and kidney, the two major organs for both gluconeogenesis and β‐oxidation (Figs. 2C and 3C), the downregulation of Calr and Hsp90b1 was rather kidney‐specific, which may place ATF6 upstream of PPARα in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) analysis (Table S2 [Sheet B]). ATF6 is an endoplasmic reticulum stress‐regulated transmembrane transcriptional factor that is activated by its proteolytic cleavage with site 1 and site 2 proteases; the resultant cytosolic portion translocates to the nucleus, binds to ER stress response elements, and induces ER stress‐responsive genes 38. Recent evidence indicates that the interruption of hepatocellular autophagy attenuates the ATF6‐mediated unfolded protein response 39; thus, conversely, renal autophagy during fasting might induce ATF6 activation.",cc4fd402-abfa-4630-9aa4-3b35c3b33887
29,discussion6," In addition, KLF15, a member of the Krüppel‐like family of transcriptional factors, has been shown to regulate gluconeogenesis and KLF15‐deficient mice displayed severe hypoglycemia after overnight fasting 40; accordingly, 2‐day fasting induced KLF15 in two gluconeogenic organs, the liver (71st highest score) and the kidney (third highest score) (Table S2 [Sheet A and B]).  The other major finding of this study was TP53‐mediated transcriptional regulation in the thymus, spleen, and liver; TP53 was listed as the second, first, and fourth highest scoring upstream regulator, respectively (Figs. 4C and 5C; Table S2 [Sheet A, C, and D]). TP53 has been described as ‘the guardian of the genome’ because it regulates ‘thousands 41’ of target genes to prevent genome mutation and is encoded by the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer; however, TP53 also regulates multiple cellular responses including autophagy 42, inflammation, pluripotency, and energy metabolism 43, 44.",fd7350e4-a04e-48ea-87d7-9108b7172224
30,discussion7," A recent study mentioned that fasting robustly increases (stabilizes) TP53 in the mouse liver via hepatocyte autonomous and AMP‐activated protein kinase‐dependent posttranscriptional mechanisms, thereby regulating gluconeogenesis and amino acid catabolism 8. In addition, TP53‐deleted mice became hypoglycemic and showed defective utilization of hepatic amino acids upon fasting 8. Of note, TP53 regulated somewhat different sets of genes in the thymus and spleen. Two‐day fasting upregulated five proteins (Krt8/18 [keratin, type II cytoskeletal 8/18], Anxa4 [annexin A4], Actb [actin, cytoplasmic 1], Serpinb6 [serpin B6], and Gsn [gelsolin]), and downregulated five proteins (Hsp90ab1 [heat shock protein HSP 90‐beta], Actn1 [alpha‐actinin‐1], Hspd1 [60 kDa heat shock protein, mitochondrial], Hspa8 [heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein], Rpsa [40S ribosomal protein SA], and Ldha [l‐lactate dehydrogenase A chain]) in the thymus (Fig. 4C, Table 3, and Table S1 [Sheet C]).",1888c851-3752-4762-a06e-4743bb318f7d
31,discussion8," In contrast, the fasting upregulated five proteins (Apoa1 [apolipoprotein A‐I], Krt8, Gstm5 [= Gstm1, glutathione S‐transferase Mu 1], Ada [adenosine deaminase], and Actn1/4 [mixtures of alpha‐actinin 1/4], and downregulated six proteins (Hsp90ab/aa1 [mixtures of heat shock protein HSP 90‐beta/alpha], Stat 1 [signal transducer and activator of transcription 1], Ezr [ezrin], Rpsa, Krt18, and Aco2 [aconitate hydratase, mitochondrial] in the spleen (Fig. 5C, Table 4, and Table S1 [Sheet D]). In the spleen, nearly half of the proteins with altered expression during fasting were TP53 target gene proteins, which may place TP53 at the top of the upstream regulator lists (Table S2 [Sheet D]). Furthermore, TP53 regulation of 12 proteins (among 19 proteins identified) was liver‐specific (Table S2 [Sheet A]).",bfe86e3b-c2a5-47fe-9e3c-2ea8932396df
32,discussion9," Fasting/calorie restriction has been also shown to reduce age‐related diseases including cancer 45; and therefore, fasting‐induced TP53 regulation could be involved in such systemic tumor suppression.  MYCN and huntingtin (HTT) were listed as the first and third highest scoring upstream regulators in the thymus (Fig. 4C), where NFKBIA and RARB were as the second and third highest scoring upstream regulators in the spleen (Fig. 5C). However, they only regulated only 6, 7, 5, and 3 proteins, respectively, in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) analysis, and their physiological roles await further investigations. In conclusion, this proteomic study revealed protein remodeling in response to fasting in the mouse liver, kidney, thymus, and spleen that could be transcriptionally regulated by PPARα and/or TP53. These findings could open new perspectives to understating the systemic effects of single fasting in animal experiments. ",d0db620b-ff8a-41a6-ba11-27def5a89967
