0,methods0," Mice and Husbandry Conditions  Male BALB/c Mice (6 weeks old) were randomly grouped into a control group (n = 6) and Ramadan model of fasting group (n = 8). All mice were individually housed and provided with feed ad libitum for 2 weeks prior to study initiation, allowing the animals acclimation to the animal facility. Mice in fasting group were fed every day with 8-h period of free access to food and water followed by 16-h of fasting, and the control group were fed ad libitum. The temperature in the animal facility was maintained at approximately 24°C degrees. The water and the diet were sterilized by elevated temperature and irradiation, respectively. Unique fecal samples for each mouse were collected on day 0 and 30. Briefly, mice were individually and temporally placed in a sterilized cage without bedding. Four to five freshly evacuated fecal pellets per mouse were collected in a 1.5 ml sterile tube. All samples were stored at −80°C until further analysis.",5b4cc966-9abd-4435-b159-a24b040309a5
1,methods1," Animal care was performed according to the Animal Ethics Procedures and Guidelines of the People’s Republic of China, and the experimental protocol was approved by the local committee on animal use and protection, Kunming University of Science and Technology.  Metagenome Sequencing and Data Processing  Fecal DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, United States), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA quality was monitored on 1% agarose gels. Reagent microbiome and bacterial environmental contamination during DNA library preparation were managed as described elsewhere (6). The quality of the library was assessed using the Qubit@ 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). The metagenome sequencing of V3–4 variable regions of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA was carried out by the NovoGene Company (Beijing, China).",a7992003-2421-4fcf-b525-d52842beb2b6
2,methods2," Data processing and analysis were performed according to routine procedures, which have been described elsewhere in detail (8–11).  Statistical Analysis  Gut microbiome diversity was assessed by the Shannon and Simpson indices, which calculated using alpha-diversity.py in QIIME, and the Mann–Whitney test was used to determine statistical significance between groups. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of Bray–Curtis distance was performed for establishing the shift of the gut microbiota composition after intermittent fasting according to a previously described method (6). Changes in gut microbial shifts were determined by using multivariate data analysis according to analysis of similarities (analysis of similarities (ANOSIM)). A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",712ab7a4-9113-42f1-bbae-885132d0dcfb
3,methods3," To identify bacterial taxa whose sequences were differentially abundant between groups, linear discriminant analysis (linear discriminant analysis (LDA)) coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe) analysis was applied with the significance level of 0.05 and the logarithmic linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score threshold equal to 4.1 ",3981bf61-2d0c-4061-918d-f1f66f74b976
4,results0," Study Execution and Next-Generation Sequencing  We previously showed in healthy humans that Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) remodels the gut microbiome and enriches SCFAs-producing microflora, potentially providing a mechanistic explanation for health-promoting effects of intermittent fasting in general and those associated with Ramadan in particular. Further mechanistic studies, however, would require an model in experimental animals, also to avoid the psychological component associated with human studies. In addition such a model would open experimental possibilities not available in human studies, like gnotobiotic experimentation, studies in genetically modified animals and studies independent of the Islamic calendar. Thus prompted, here we aimed to prospectively investigate Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) effects in BALB/c mice (Figure 1A), generally considered to be a versatile animal model.",eb110edf-dbca-439a-b1ce-a3218cac1ff5
5,results1," After fecal DNA isolation, the bacterial V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to map the gut microbiota. As a result, a total of 2,287,043 valid sequences were generated and the average for each sample was 68740 ± 4769 (mean ± SD) sequences. Rarefaction curves were plotted to determine the sequence number per group at the same depth. The number of OTUs reached a saturation plateau at a level of 55,000 sequences for each group (Figure 1B), indicating that the sequencing depth was sufficient to represent the majority of bacterial species for each group, although the mice in fasting group show evidence for increased presence of low-abundant bacterial species. Rank-abundance curves were generated to visualize both species richness and evenness of the microbiome in each group at different time points (Figure 1C).",423940b8-2f07-4b06-84c0-e9c00629ec99
6,results2," There was no clear difference between two groups either before or after IF with respect to species richness and evenness, suggesting that these parameters are not markedly influenced by Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) in BALB/c mice.

Intermittent Fasting Alters the Composition of the Gut Microbiome  For further analysis of the diversity in the gut microbiome in animals subjected to Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) and the appropriate controls, the Shannon and Simpson indices, which are important and commonly used diversity indicators of an ecosystem, were calculated. As shown in Figure 2A, gut microbiome diversity was not significantly changed after the fasting, showing that fasting of these animals has no major effect on mean species diversity. Next, changes in microbiome composition were visualized using Bray–Curtis distance-based principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA).",f045ef7d-af4d-4302-ad26-b3c689598926
8,results4," Before the onset of fasting begun (Day 0), microbiome composition was not different between the fasting and non-fasting groups of mice according to Analysis of Similarities (analysis of similarities (ANOSIM)) (R = 0, p = 0.46) (Figure 2B). After 30 days of IF, however, a remarkable difference was found between the two groups (R = 0.74, p = 0.002 by analysis of similarities (ANOSIM)) (Figure 2C), indicating that the relative abundance of certain bacterial taxa had changed during the fasting. To further identify the bacterial taxa influenced by fasting, LEfSe analysis was performed. Multiple taxonomic differences were found when comparing the results of fasting mice to the no fasting controls (Figure 2D). At phylum level, an increase of the phylum Firmicutes and depletion of the phylum Bacteroidetes was associated with fasting.  FIGURE 2 IF shapes the composition of the gut microbiome in BALB/c mice.

10,results6,"  Intermittent Fasting Elevates the Lachnospiroceae and Ruminococcaceae Families  For further confirmation of the fasting-provoked alterations in the microbiome identified, differences in the bacterial taxa identified by the LEfSe were reanalyzed using unpaired t-tests. In agreement with the findings of the LEfSe, we again observed that the phylum Firmicutes was indeed increased as a result of Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF), while the Bacteroidetes was decreased (Table 1). No significance was found between two groups before fasting. At the family level, it was evident that the abundance of both Lachnospiroceae and Ruminococcaceae was significantly increased by Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) (Table 1). This may relate to the beneficial effects of IF has on gastrointestinal tract physiology, because these two families are known as important contributors to short-chain fatty acid production in the intestine.",09aa8001-1226-468e-b4b5-b3a77cca1955
11,results7," Interestingly, the Rikenellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae families were also enriched after the fasting (Table 1). Since upregulation of these two families have been associated with reduced visceral adipose tissue compartment size and improved metabolic profiles in humans (12) and thus the effects seen in mice may reflect a beneficial microbiological shift provoked by IF in general. In contrast, the levels of the Bacteroidetes S24-7 and Prevotellaceae families decreased following fasting as compared to controls, whereas no difference between the groups was found in any of these families before fasting.

12,discussion0," Ramadan-associated intermittent fasting is a form of periodic fasting adhered to by millions of adherents of the Islamic faith. A growing number of studies have been conducted in humans to investigate the health effects of Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF), and we recently characterized the chances in gut microbiome in this respect (6). Volunteer studies in humans suffer, however, from specific cofounders (psychology, altered physical activity during Ramadan, altered circadian rhythms etcetera) and studies in humans are less suited for mechanistic investigation (e.g., it is not possible to conduct studies involving genetic modification of the study subjects). A study in experimental animals would show that the effects of Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) observed indeed relate to the timing of food intake and would allow future mechanistic studies.",144ac0da-c374-4a70-8e4f-bdb465faf292
13,discussion1," Prompted by these consideration we characterized the effect of Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) in BALB/c mice. We observe that changes in microbiome resemble those seen in Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) in our earlier study (6). The most straightforward interpretation of these observations is that indeed timing of food intake drives the effects seen of Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) in humans and thus the present study provides further support for the notion that IF can provoke beneficial changes in gut microbiome. In addition, the alterations observed within the bacterial communities might also be provoked by metabolic or immune modifications within host cells such as the production of hormones or ketone bodies, as these factors are known to shape the gut microbiota composition and its function (13, 14).",027226be-6378-4c64-9058-4a029e91337b
14,discussion2," Among the effects, the upregulation of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae during the fasting was the most notable and this aligns well with the studies of others associating these bacteria as important drivers for health effects of IF (8, 9).  Over last decade, gut microbiota has attracted great scientific and public attention, and is widely recognized as the nexus of the interaction between life style (e.g., dietary habits) and health status (10). The Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families are two most abundant and are seen as the major contributor to luminal biochemistry, while these families are also described as the health-associated core microbiome (11). Both are major SCFAs-producers in our gut and by providing nutritional energy and positional signals to the epithelial compartment play a crucial roles in maintaining the physiological homeostasis of the host.",8bd0e57c-0b41-4e68-b730-16cd268e2833
15,discussion3," Dysbiosis of these two families is associated with various diseases, especially obesity (15), type 2 diabetes (16), liver cirrhosis (17) and aging (11). Lachnospiraceae are significantly reduced in obesity and levels do not return to those seen in healthy controls even after gastric bypass (15), while Ruminococcaceae were seen to increased following a 2-day modified IF intervention and appear to be negatively associated with the severity of cardiometabolic disease in metabolic syndrome (18). In the present study, we showed that both Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families were upregulated in their abundance in the Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) group, while the abundance of Prevotellaceae was decreased. These changes all echo our previous findings on the alterations of the gut microbiome in healthy subjects who underwent Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) (6).",ad3e8b70-8a45-4120-979e-72f84b6bae21
16,discussion4," These data are also in line with previous studies with 7 month of every other day fasting (8, 19). Collectively, this study indicates that experimental rodents can be successfully employed to model Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF).  Preclinical studies in experimental animals are often essential for understanding disease and therapy and direct design of subsequent clinical study (20). As an extremely important and useful experimental animal, BALB/c mice have been shown to be exceedingly useful for studying both immunology and cancer and many tools tailored for the mouse strain are available (21–23). A great number of studies have been performed to identify the role of the gut microbiome and their implications in health and disease using BALB/C mouse models (22, 23).",dcd7bac2-d5b3-4eea-a0b5-bda2050bf5e0
17,discussion5," Successful mimicking the effects of Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) in this mouse model provides an novel avenue for preclinical studies on how Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) influences immunology and perhaps cancer progress, especially in gut microbiome dysbiosis-associated conditions.  In summary, we have demonstrated that Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) shapes the gut microbiota in BALB/c mice, characterized with an increase in SCFAs-producing bacteria. These results support the notion that Ramadan associated intermittent fasting (RAIF) in humans works through the temporal spacing of nutrient consumption and provide an experimental model that will allow dissection of the underlying mechanisms.
