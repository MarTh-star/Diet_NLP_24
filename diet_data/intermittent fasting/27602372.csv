0,introduction0,"While fat (white adipose tissue, white adipose tissue (WAT)) is often associated with development of obesity and type 2 diabetes, it is essential for energy homeostasis by storing excess energy and releasing lipids in response to energy deficits1,2. Recent studies have discovered that white adipose tissue (WAT) also contributes to whole-body metabolism by regulating thermogenic activity via the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), which increases energy expenditure and improves insulin sensitivity3. In this regard, white adipose tissue (WAT) browning has been suggested as a therapeutic approach for obesity and metabolic diseases. A variety of physiological stimuli (e.g., cold exposure, exercise) and signaling ligands (e.g., FGF21, BMP, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) have been identified for their potential to induce white adipose tissue (WAT) browning4.",124edb08-99fe-452f-a78c-fec8c59ca2a6
1,introduction1," In addition, recent studies highlight the critical role of the innate immune response with alternative activation of adipose macrophage (M2 macrophage) in the regulation of metabolic function of adipose tissues, including white adipose tissue (WAT) browning5.  We and others have previously demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor in adipose tissues (adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) plays a key role in browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) and maintaining the functional integrity of adipose tissues, suggesting the therapeutic potential of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the treatment of metabolic disorders6,7,8,9. For example, cold acclimatization10, exercise11, and environmental stimuli9 promote the expression of adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hence white adipose tissue (WAT) browning.",fb6f360b-9a52-423e-853c-37696be907fb
2,introduction2," However, the molecular mechanism underlying vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated white adipose tissue (WAT) browning remains elusive.  Modern lifestyles favor longer periods of daily energy intake and shorter fasting periods. This erratic eating pattern is associated with metabolic disadvantages and contributes to the current global obesity and diabetes epidemic12. Fasting brings various positive health impacts, suggesting that modulation of fasting period can be used as a therapeutic intervention13,14. Intermittent fasting (IF), a periodic energy restriction method, has been shown to provide health benefits equivalent to prolonged fasting or caloric restriction (CR)14,15,16,17,18. The beneficial effects of IF against aging, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases have been studied in both animal models and clinical settings15,19,20,21.",ca3e1b15-e92c-4083-b5fb-dabfd0d3db1b
3,introduction3," However, it is unclear whether the metabolic benefits conferred by IF are primarily mediated by reduced food intake19,22,23 or attributed to changes in eating pattern. In particular, the 'alternate day fasting' regimen (i.e., 1 day feeding-1 day fasting, 1:1 IF), which is often used in rodent IF models, could result in underfeeding19,24. In addition, while white adipose tissue (WAT) is one of the most critical organs for fasting physiology, it is not known whether the molecular alteration of white adipose tissue (WAT) after IF is a driver or an outcome of IF-mediated metabolic benefits.  In this study, we establish a new IF regimen to investigate the impact of IF under isocaloric conditions and demonstrate that IF improves glucose homeostasis and prevents diet-induced metabolic dysfunction without caloric intake reduction.",0dff6451-4848-43fa-87c5-9e70f4462fe7
4,introduction4," Mechanistically, we found that white adipose tissue (WAT) is pivotal for mediating IF-induced metabolic benefits via browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) through adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated alternative activation of adipose macrophage (M2 macrophage). Our study unveils a novel mechanism by which IF promotes whole-body homeostasis through browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated macrophage switching.

24,results0,"An IF regimen protects mice from diet-induced metabolic abnormalities To minimize the differences in caloric intake which may be caused by the alternate day fasting19, we developed a new IF regimen comprising 2 day feeding-1 day fasting periods (2:1 IF; Figure 1A). This regimen provided mice with sufficient time to compensate for the decreased body weight and for the reduced amount of food intake after 1-day fasting, to the level of non-fasted animals, enabling us to examine the effects of IF, independent of caloric intake difference (Supplementary information, Figure S1A-S1C).  Eight-week-old mice were subjected to 16 weeks of the 2:1 IF regimen on either normal chow diet (ND) or 45% high-fat diet (high fat diet (HFD)). Compared to mice fed ad libitum (AL), IF mice showed lower body weight on both ND and high fat diet (HFD) (Figure 1B; Supplementary information, Figure S1D and S1E).",2ef42c9d-a9dc-4790-86cd-f2a3679b26da
25,results1," In further analyses, we focused mainly on IF and AL mice fed high fat diet (HFD) (high fat diet (HFD)-IF and high fat diet (HFD)-AL) because they showed a marked difference in weight gain than those fed ND (Supplementary information, Figure S1F). We speculated that the reduced weight gain of IF animals might be due to the slight decrease in accumulated energy intake over 16 weeks of the diet program (Figure 1C). However, our pair-feeding experiments consistently showed that IF animals exhibited reduced weight gain, compared to mice pair-fed ad libitum with exactly the same amount of food as IF mice (high fat diet (HFD)-PF; Supplementary information, Figure S2A-S2C). These data suggest that IF-mediated decrease in body weight is not primarily attributed to an energy intake difference. Body composition analysis revealed reduced fat mass without changes of lean mass in IF mice (Figure 1D and Supplementary information, Figure S2D).",b0e5c2a9-959b-4aaf-b1cb-a6d4f9d88347

Lipid accumulation in brown adipose tissue (brown adipose tissue (BAT)) was also decreased in high fat diet (HFD)-IF, compared to high fat diet (HFD)-AL mice (Figure 1E).",abbb9624-7478-4f64-9235-9ae781fcdd69
27,results3," Notably, high fat diet (HFD)-IF mice showed improved glucose homeostasis with smaller glucose excursion in glucose tolerance test (glucose tolerance test (GTT)), increased insulin sensitivity in insulin tolerance test (insulin tolerance test (ITT)), and markedly lower homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), compared to high fat diet (HFD)-AL or high fat diet (HFD)-PF mice (Figure 1G-1I; Supplementary information, Figure S2E and S2F). Moreover, IF prevented high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis. IF mice exhibited lower liver weight, less lipid accumulation in liver, and lower plasma alanine aminotransferase (aminotransferase (ALT)) activity (Supplementary information, Figure S1H-S1L). Together, these findings demonstrate that, in the absence of any energy intake difference, IF offers metabolic benefits against diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction.",05da0d28-2e14-46b4-b182-04ec2f56b9ad
28,results4,"  We also tested the therapeutic potential of IF on established metabolic abnormalities by performing 2:1 IF on obese mice induced by high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks (post high fat diet (HFD); Supplementary information, Figure S3A) and were able to observe beneficial effects as early as 6 weeks of IF. This short-term 2:1 IF treatment on post high fat diet (HFD) mice resulted in a slight reduction in body weight without changes in total caloric intake (Supplementary information, Figure S3B and S3C). Consistent with our results above, IF led to a selective decrease in fat mass, particularly in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass and adipocyte size, whereas lean mass was not affected (Supplementary information, Figure S3D-S3F). Liver function parameters were also improved by 6 weeks of IF (Supplementary information, Figure S3G-S3J).",1ea1a979-67ac-4bd6-952a-b15e235aaee0
29,results5," Importantly, short-term IF treatment significantly improved systemic glucose homeostasis as assessed by glucose tolerance test (GTT) and HOMA-IR, compared to untreated mice (Supplementary information, Figure S3K and S3L). Together, these data indicate that IF is not only protective method, but also effective therapeutics against obesity.  Transcriptome analysis of IF-treated white adipose tissue (WAT) It has been suggested that IF promotes various health benefits, yet the underlying mechanism is still not fully understood. Given that adipose tissues are pivotal for supplying energy to other tissues during fasting, and were one of the most affected organs/tissues after IF, we performed transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on perigonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) (Pwhite adipose tissue (WAT)) from mice subjected to IF or AL to gain insight into the genome-wide alteration of adipose tissue gene expression by IF.",0516d084-c3fb-415c-9f8b-a2b898c6847e
30,results6," Excluding high fat diet (HFD)-AL, the ND-AL, ND-IF and high fat diet (HFD)-IF groups clustered together, indicating that even with high fat diet (HFD) feeding, IF induced a global change in transcriptome that resembles gene expression profiles of metabolically normal animals (Figure 2A). Overall, 3 644 genes were differentially expressed among the four conditions and formed 6 distinct gene clusters. Clusters 1, 3, and 4 demonstrated significant gene enrichment by using terms of gene ontology (GO term) and KEGG pathway databases (Figure 2A; Supplementary information, Figure S4 and Table S1). In particular, we focused on clusters 1 and 3 that show dramatic differences in gene expression profile between high fat diet (HFD)-AL and high fat diet (HFD)-IF with clearly distinguished metabolic phenotypes. Cluster 1 genes (i.e.",f7169966-c77d-443c-a7b8-a667e89f6aca
31,results7,", upregulated specifically in high fat diet (HFD)-AL compared to other groups) were strongly enriched in the pathways involved in the immune response and inflammation, which are associated with insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction25 (Figure 2A and Supplementary information, Figure S4A). qPCR verified that genes associated with inflammatory cells and their chemotactic activity were significantly downregulated in high fat diet (HFD)-IF compared to high fat diet (HFD)-AL (Figure 2B). On the other hand, GO term analysis of cluster 3 genes (i.e., downregulated specifically in high fat diet (HFD)-AL) revealed biological processes including brown adipocyte differentiation (i.e., Ebf2)26 (Figure 2A and Supplementary information, Figure S4B). This finding is aligned with cluster 6 (i.e., upregulated only in high fat diet (HFD)-IF group) indicating that the futile metabolic cycle with concurrently elevated genes involved in fatty acid synthesis (e.g.",8509a6fd-081e-4319-ba7b-47fb679181f4

Together, these results suggest that IF promotes a reduction of inflammation and an increase of thermogenic activities in white adipose tissue (WAT).  IF leads to adipose thermogenesis Next, we validated browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) in high fat diet (HFD)-IF mice. The expression of Adrb3 (encoding β3-AR; indicative of sympathetic activation) as well as levels of beige/brown adipose markers (i.e., Ppargc1a, Cidea and Ucp1) were significantly elevated in perigonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) (Pwhite adipose tissue (WAT)) of high fat diet (HFD)-IF mice, compared to that of high fat diet (HFD)-AL mice (Figure 2C). Similar results were also observed in white adipose tissue (WAT) of post high fat diet (HFD)-IF mice (Supplementary information, Figure S5A).",d0231fc9-f04d-4d06-8da6-b458ac3d433b
33,results9," In addition, Ucp1 gene expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) was found to be higher in high fat diet (HFD)-IF mice compared to high fat diet (HFD)-AL mice (Supplementary information, Figure S5B), suggesting increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation by IF. To visually examine beige adipocytes, we also utilized the beige-chaser mice generated by crossing Ucp1-Cre with Rosa26mT/mG mice. high fat diet (HFD)-IF white adipose tissue (WAT) exhibited more GFP+ beige adipocytes (Figure 2D), whereas the number of GFP+ brown adipocytes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) was indistinguishable between high fat diet (HFD)-IF and high fat diet (HFD)-AL mice (Supplementary information, Figure S5C).",9fc556e4-e860-417b-847a-d0f32b207383
34,results10," Consistent with the elevated level of beige adipocytes and higher Ucp1 expression, indirect calorimetry, with normalization of body mass or adjustment for body mass using regression-based analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), revealed that O2 consumption in high fat diet (HFD)-IF mice was increased, particularly during the feeding period (i.e., Day 2), without significant changes in physical activities, compared to high fat diet (HFD)-AL mice (Figure 2E-2G; Supplementary information, Figure S5D-S5G). On the other hand, O2 consumption during the fasting period (i.e., Day 1) was not different between groups (Figure 2E and Supplementary information, Figure S5E). Together, these data suggest that IF led to an increase in beige adipocytes, thereby elevating energy expenditure, particularly during energy intake.",de946f3d-d1d2-48bb-9b19-090175f15f8b
35,results11,"  Adipose thermogenesis largely contributes to IF-mediated metabolic benefits To examine whether the beneficial effects of IF could be attributed to adipose thermogenesis, we performed IF in a thermoneutral (TN) condition (30 °C), where the thermogenic activation is significantly restricted29. Indeed, despite increased sympathetic activation (i.e., higher Adrb3 expression), TN-high fat diet (HFD)-IF mice showed no significant changes of beige/brown adipose marker gene expression in perigonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) (Pwhite adipose tissue (WAT)), compared to TN-high fat diet (HFD)-AL mice (Supplementary information, Figure S6A). This suggests that thermoneutrality effectively hindered IF-induced white adipose tissue (WAT) browning. Although Ucp1 expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) was increased by IF under TN conditions, its basal expression level was much lower (∼10%) compared to that at normal temperature (Supplementary information, Figure S6B).",5b9d6015-6cd2-4d4f-9cea-01f60c4910d7
36,results12," Consistently, O2 consumption was not significantly different between the two groups under TN feeding condition (Supplementary information, Figure S6C), suggesting that the increased Ucp1 in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of TN-high fat diet (HFD)-IF mice may not be functionally significant. Intriguingly, however, TN-high fat diet (HFD)-IF mice still exhibited a mild improvement in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and HOMA-IR, with a reduction in body weight, fat mass, as well as hepatic steatosis, compared to TN-high fat diet (HFD)-AL mice (Supplementary information, Figure S6D-S6L). Although the TN condition does not completely abolish the metabolic benefits of IF, it significantly reduced the degree of improvement by IF (e.g., glucose tolerance test (GTT) difference: 9% in TN vs 28% in normal temperature), further emphasizing the key contributing role of adipose thermogenesis in IF.",81b4d505-c451-4d9e-a89c-6fabace5ac43
37,results13,"  Fasting induces adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression We next aimed to identify a molecular driver of IF-induced metabolic benefits and adipose thermogenesis. As white adipose tissue (WAT) plays a crucial role in whole-body metabolic homeostasis through the production of numerous secretory proteins including adipokines30,31, we examined changes of the chemokine and adipokine pathways between high fat diet (HFD)-AL and high fat diet (HFD)-IF. Out of 710 adipose secretory proteins as defined by Lehr et al.30, several potential adipokine genes were markedly upregulated in high fat diet (HFD)-IF perigonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) (Pwhite adipose tissue (WAT)), including Vegfa (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)), Cfd (adipsin), Nrg4 (neuregulin 4), and Adipoq (adiponectin), whereas Lep (leptin), which positively correlates with adiposity, was downregulated (Figure 3A and 3B).",7910d174-0e19-4bdc-b7e9-26b5f7ded260
38,results14," To test whether these genes potentially function as drivers or are simply outcomes of repeated fasting, we examined how one-time fasting affects the expression of these genes. Noticeably, a 24-h fasting significantly increased Vegfa expression in white adipose tissue (WAT), while reducing Lep and Nrg4 transcripts (Figure 3C). Given that higher expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leptin and neuregulin 4 positively correlates with adipose thermogenesis8,9,32,33, these results suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in white adipose tissue (WAT), but not leptin or Nrg4 (both decreased by fasting), is a potential modulator of IF.  We further examined how and where fasting-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression is regulated. Vegfa expression levels in white adipose tissue (WAT) increase progressively with the fasting duration and the increase can be immediately reversed by refeeding (Figure 3D and 3E).",0ee26614-5b71-4be0-9c9d-5cdc59320d7c
39,results15," Importantly, fasting-stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression is restricted to white adipose tissue (WAT), not in brown adipose tissue (BAT), other metabolic tissues or plasma (Supplementary information, Figure S7A-S7D). While previous studies showed that sympathetic activity controls vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression34, total plasma catecholamine level was not increased by fasting (Supplementary information, Figure S7E), suggesting that fasting-stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) is regulated via peripheral, not central, sympathetic nervous system. Moreover, fasting-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was blocked markedly by the β3-AR antagonist, SR59230A, but less effectively by the non-specific β-AR antagonist, propranolol (Figure 3E).",b47be130-cf2a-45b4-9882-fd387883f6ff

To test this possibility, macrophages, which are another source of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)37,38, were depleted in mice by administration of Clodronate37,39. Notably, macrophage depletion, verified by abolished F4/80 gene expression (Supplementary information, Figure S7F), did not affect fasting-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induction in white adipose tissue (WAT) and was even increased in expression levels compared to vehicle-treated control mice (Figure 3F). This finding further supports our conclusion that adipocytes are the major sources of fasting-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induction.",7949a65d-d42a-4077-8865-b9eefb5bd266
41,results17," Functionally, the acute increase of adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by a 24-h fasting was not sufficient to induce changes in vascularization (Supplementary information, Figure S7G), whereas repeated fasting (i.e., IF) significantly increased white adipose tissue (WAT) vascularization, both macroscopically and microscopically (Figure 3G-3I). Given that improved vascularization with adipose-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a positive role in adipose tissue function and metabolic homeostasis against obesity and diabetes6,7,8, our results together suggest that fasting-induced adipose vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression underlies IF-induced metabolic benefits and adipose thermogenesis.

Intriguingly, IF had no significant effect on white adipose tissue (WAT) weight and adipocyte size in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)AdKO mice fed high fat diet (HFD) even with decreased body weight (Figure 4A-4C). Consistent with this, adipose Lep gene expression and plasma leptin levels, which positively correlate with adiposity, were also indistinguishable between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)AdKO-high fat diet (HFD)-IF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)AdKO-high fat diet (HFD)-AL mice (Figure 4D and 4E).",800987bb-dfb3-4643-9e67-15bd0fafc992

In addition, glucose tolerance test (GTT) and HOMA-IR revealed that IF does not improve glucose homeostasis in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)AdKO mice (Figure 4F and 4G). IF-mediated improvement of liver steatosis was also abolished in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)AdKO mice (Supplementary information, Figure S8A-S8C). Importantly, loss of adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) abolished IF-mediated white adipose tissue (WAT) browning, and there was no difference in Ucp1 gene expression even in the presence of sympathetic activation (i.e., increased Adrb3; Figure 4H). Moreover, IF-induced brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation was not observed in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)AdKO mice (Figure 4I).

Both transgenic mice showed significantly elevated adipose Vegfa expression and vascularization (Figure 5C and 5D; Supplementary information, Figure S9A). They also exhibited lower body weight due to decreased fat mass without changes of lean mass, reduced adipose tissue weight and cell size, and improved glucose homeostasis (Figure 5E-5H).

Fasting and adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induce alternative activation of adipose macrophages Although vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is implicated in white adipose tissue (WAT) browning in response to cold, exercise, and environmental enrichment9,10, its underlying mechanism is not well understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that cold- and exercise-induced white adipose tissue (WAT) browning is mediated through alternative activation of adipose macrophage by type 2 immune cytokines41,42. In addition, both cold acclimation and exercise, similar to our fasting condition, also increase adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression10,43.",17e0417c-67ec-4250-9d2b-c26a830c5e92
47,results23," Therefore, we speculated that browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) in IF might be mediated by alternatively activated macrophage. Indeed, we found that IF cycles led to alternative activation of adipose tissue macrophage indicated by elevated expression of M2 macrophage marker genes (e.g., Clec10a and Il10) in perigonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) (Pwhite adipose tissue (WAT)) (Figure 6A), whereas expression of classical M1 macrophage marker genes was unchanged by IF. As a result, the M1/M2 gene expression ratio was reduced by IF (Supplementary information, Figure S10A). On the contrary, but consistent with the lack of white adipose tissue (WAT) browning in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)AdKO-high fat diet (HFD)-IF mice, loss of adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) completely eliminated the IF-mediated increase of alternatively activated adipose macrophage (Figure 6B; Supplementary information, Figure S10B and S10C).",885f114e-30a7-495b-bba6-f46e76d43716
48,results24," Similarly, the TN condition that blocked IF-stimulated white adipose tissue (WAT) browning also hindered IF-induced M2 macrophage polarization (Supplementary information, Figure S10D and S10E). Notably, intermittent overexpression of adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)Adipoq-Tg resulted in increased M2 marker gene expression, leading to a significant reduction in the M1/M2 ratio (Figure 6C; Supplementary information, Figure S10F and S10G). This finding was further verified by flow cytometry and whole-mount imaging, which showed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)Adipoq-Tg mice exhibited increased expression of Cd206 and Cd301 in white adipose tissue (WAT) macrophage with a reduced M1/M2 ratio (i.e., Cd11c+/Cd206+ and Cd11c+/Cd301+), compared to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)CTRL mice (Supplementary information, Figure S10H-S10J).",2adf8a00-0ba6-4ed0-9abc-7eb8e4c5c9af
49,results25," Collectively, these data demonstrate that IF and adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) cycles promote alternative activation of adipose macrophage closely linked to white adipose tissue (WAT) browning.  Importantly, even one-time 24-h fasting is sufficient to induce M2 macrophage polarization as evidenced by increased M2 macrophages and their marker gene expression (e.g., Clea10a, Il10, Ym1 and Arg1) as well as decreased expression of M1 marker genes (e.g., Nos and Il1b; Figure 6D and 6E; Supplementary information, Figure S11A). This suggests that these acute changes are repeated during IF, thereby facilitating its metabolic benefits. In addition, acute induction (i.e., 48 h) of adipose Vegfa overexpression (∼3.5-fold) using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)Adipoq-Tg mice, whose level is comparable to 24-h fasted mice (Figure 3C), is sufficient to increase M2 macrophage (Figure 6F; Supplementary information, Figure S11B-S11E).",cfb3a981-beb0-429a-9a6b-1ce657e5efd0
50,results26," However, direct administration of both mouse and human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to Raw264.7 macrophages did not affect their properties, in contrast to interleukin-4 (IL-4) and lipopolysaccharide treatments that promote M2 and M1 polarizations, respectively (Supplementary information, Figure S11F). We found that a 24-h fasting upregulates gene expression of Il-4, Il-5 and Il-13 (Figure 6G), type 2 cytokines important for the activation of M2 macrophage5. Acute induction of adipose vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) also elevated IL-5 gene expression (Figure 6H). These results suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated M2 macrophage polarization is indirectly regulated, possibly via type 2 immune signaling.  Next, we tested whether adipose macrophages and their M2 polarization are required for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced white adipose tissue (WAT) browning.",167ba1c7-bde1-43f6-9082-3cf5625fb2d5

55,discussion0,"Accumulating evidence suggests that IF provides various biological benefits in animal models and humans13,14. For example, the 5:2 diet, which involves CR for 2 non-consecutive days a week and unconstrained eating the other 5 days, has become a popular IF regimen and has a potential to be considered for medical interventions13. However, it remains elusive whether the effects upon IF, often tested by alternate day fasting in rodent models19, are attributed to reduced calorie intake and/or modified eating pattern. The present study, using an isocaloric mouse model with a 2:1 IF regimen, demonstrates calorie-independent metabolic benefits of IF. Together with recent important findings on time-restricted feeding and a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD)52,53, our data support the significance of not only 'what/how much' but also 'when/how often' in energy intake to sustain energy homeostasis and metabolic health.",31f7e7e4-62eb-4560-838a-659dc505d6c6

Both IF and CR impact on nearly all metabolic organs/tissues including hypothalamus, liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues13,14. However, the key organ/tissue driving the IF-induced metabolic benefits is not clearly defined.

We demonstrate in this study that fasting is a physiological means of increasing adipose Vegfa gene expression (Figure 3), in addition to exercise11 and cold exposure10. Accordingly, IF confers similar metabolic impacts as physical exercise and cold exposure (e.g., browning of white adipose tissue (WAT)) with markedly increased adipose vasculature.

This further suggests that combinatory stimuli to activate both subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissue (WAT), such as IF and exercise or IF and cold exposure, could generate synergistic metabolic benefits.

Of note, it appears that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R1 (Flt1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2 (Flk1), are not expressed in preadipocytes or mature adipocytes6, leading us to postulate that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) acts indirectly in adipose tissue remodeling.",b122d297-df7a-4d4c-87a5-bccadec03098

Furthermore, (3) the M1/M2 macrophage balance, rather than the number of macrophage, may be critical for adipose thermogenesis, as all fasted mice had reductions in the number of adipose macrophage regardless of conditions.

Among various upstream signaling pathways implicated in M2 polarization60, we found elevated type2 cytokines by both fasting (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) and acute adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induction (IL-5), suggesting that adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may act on other upstream immune cells, such as eosinophils, T-helper cell 2 (Th2), or type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), to promote M2 polarization61. Therefore, future studies delineating a precise role (e.g., activation or recruitment of immune cells) and its molecular mechanism (e.g., through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)B56) of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in adipose immunometabolism should uncover the fundamental mechanism in white adipose tissue (WAT) browning.",d702b248-6263-4a39-b97c-1053c37c17f1
65,discussion10," Furthermore, other adipose factors that we observed to be affected by IF, such as leptin, neuregulin 4, adiponectin and adipsin, could play a role in fasting-mediated immunometabolic responses. This might be particularly expected for leptin, whose expression level is reduced by IF or fasting in white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) (not in skeletal muscle or liver). Leptin modulates a wide range of immune and inflammatory processes, and leptin-deficient mast cells undergo M2 polarization62. Given that leptin could synergistically act with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (e.g., in angiogenesis)63, it will be of interest to examine the implication of leptin in fasting- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated metabolic benefits. On the other hand, these adipose factors may be involved in the non-thermogenic effects of IF.",c59ea452-1e8b-4ff5-b838-eefd571f51ab
66,discussion11," Although thermoneutrality markedly reduced the metabolic benefits of IF with inhibition of white adipose tissue (WAT) browning, it did not completely eliminate the IF's effects as adipose-derived factors showed similar gene expression (data not shown). As previous studies demonstrate that neuregulin 4 and adipsin are implicated in inhibition of hepatic steatosis32 and improvement of insulin secretion64, respectively, the non-thermogenic benefits of IF may be attributed to these adipose-derived factors or possibly other physiological responses, such as reduced adipose inflammation and increased insulin sensitivity (Figure 2A, Cluster #3).  IF has been practiced in human clinical settings with various fasting regimens, and most studies revealed similar beneficial health effects such as body weight reduction and increased insulin sensitivity18,21,65,66. However, IF can be stressful to body and mind, because 24-h fasting can reduce body weight by 2%-3% in humans65 and 5%-10% in mice.",cbd3d1e1-4672-4e5a-8a96-253c1778c308
67,discussion12," Although it is not easy to compare the effects of fasting in mice directly with humans due to differences in basal metabolic rate, food intake, as well as age differences67, IF appears to improve eating behavior and mood in humans68. It will be important to overcome potential limitations by developing a method to improve the practicality of IF if our findings are to have translational perspective. For example, a method like FMD that provides various metabolic benefits in both mice and humans18,21,66 would improve the practicality of IF in a clinical setting. Further rigorous studies are required to examine: (1) whether the beneficial effects of IF last after stopping the fasting (i.e., if there is a rebound effect); (2) whether there is any potential harm of IF; and (3) whether IF benefits apply to all generations (i.e., an age-dependent issue) and disease conditions.",46e54c32-580d-4612-ba31-39b3b0acc29e
68,discussion13," Notably, 5 weeks of IF was able to drive beneficial metabolic effects in 8-month-old mice with high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity (unpublished data), further emphasizing the therapeutic potential of IF in age-associated metabolic abnormalities. To further determine the mechanism of IF, it is necessary to test whether fasting (or IF) induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in human adipose tissues, and whether fasting-induced adipose vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes M2 polarization and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning in humans. Thus, future studies are warranted to examine the adaptive response of human adipose tissues to fasting or IF intervention via thermogenic and even non-thermogenic pathways, in association with the proposed mechanisms such as circadian rhythm53,69, gut microbiome changes70, and sleep regulation.",1a79d8ec-e5d3-4013-8d10-d55f589207d6
69,discussion14,"  In summary, our data demonstrate that metabolic benefits of IF are largely mediated by adipose thermogenesis without overall caloric reduction. We showed that fasting-induced adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in white adipose tissue (WAT) browning through M2 macrophage activation. This finding is further supported by human adipose tissue gene expression analysis illustrating positive correlations between adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and both M2 macrophage and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning. Together, the present study illustrates the role of IF-induced adipose-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in remodeling the immunometabolic property of adipose tissue, highlighting the importance of eating pattern and physiological fasting duration to sustain metabolic homeostasis.
