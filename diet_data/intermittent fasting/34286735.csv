8,results0," Fasting Changes the Amount and Morphology of Lipid Droplets in the Liver of Obese Mice  After 8 weeks of feeding, the average body weight of mice in ND (normal diet) group was 20.79 ± 1.31 g, while it reached 34.83 ± 3.26 g in High fat diet (HFD) group, reflecting a 67.53% increase in the body weight (data not shown). According to the reported criteria that more than 20% average weight gain could be considered as the diet-induced obesity, the obese mouse model in our study was successfully established. To investigate the impact of fasting on the hepatic lipid metabolism, the histological sections of livers from ND and High fat diet (HFD) mice were stained with oil red O to observe the changes of lipid droplets. As shown in Figure 1, the morphology and number of lipid droplets in the liver of ND mice did not apparently alter at different time points after fasting, except that a number of small lipid droplets were present at 8 h of fasting.",46976ba9-452c-4104-b0b9-7442aaf9fbb1
9,results1," By contrast, the amount of lipid droplets in the livers of High fat diet (HFD) mice was significantly increased after 8 and 16 h of fasting, with the presence of unusually large and small lipid droplets, and the large lipid droplets displayed a light staining. At 24 h of fasting, the number of lipid droplets remained constant, but the large lipid droplets became smaller with deeper staining compared to 16 h. Until 32 h of fasting, the number of lipid droplets began to decrease (Figure 1A). Notably, the number and volume of lipid droplets were substantially increased in High fat diet (HFD) mice at each time point of fasting compared to those in ND mice (Figure 1A). To further verify whether lipid droplet fusion induced by fasting was a general phenotype in obese mice, we also observed the lipid droplet morphologies at 16 and 24 h of fasting in ob/ob mice.",08500b82-17d2-4025-8549-2ece93072561
10,results2," The oil red O staining of liver sections revealed that the lipid droplets were apparently increased with light staining in ob/ob mice at 16 and 24 h of fasting (Figure 1B), indicating that fasting promoted lipid droplet fusion in both diet- and genetically-induced obesity mouse models.

Cidec Expression Is Induced by Fasting in High fat diet (HFD) Mice  Previous studies have shown that Cidec takes a critical part in promoting lipid droplet fusion and development (17), we thus examined the involvement of Cidec in the lipid droplet dynamics in High fat diet (HFD) mice under fasting condition. We detected the mRNA and protein expression levels of Cidec in High fat diet (HFD) mice at different time points of fasting. As shown in Figure 2A, mRNA expression of Cidec was considerably upregulated at both 16 h (P < 0.05) and at 24 h (P < 0.05) after fasting. Consistently, significant increases of Cidec protein levels were observed at 16 and 24 h of fasting compared to 0 h (P < 0.05; Figures 2B,C), suggesting that fasting in the context of obesity promotes the expression of Cidec.

14,results6,"  Fasting Activates activated protein kinase (AMPK) Expression in High fat diet (HFD) Mice  Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) is a cellular energy sensor that is activated at low energy states to restore the energy, depending on the ratios of AMP/ATP and NAD+/NADH. After fasting, the starvation increases the AMP/ATP ratio in vivo, we thus hypothesized that activated protein kinase (AMPK) might be activated under this condition. To confirm this possibility, the liver tissues from High fat diet (HFD) mice at different fasting time points were collected to detect the total protein levels and phosphorylation levels of activated protein kinase (AMPK) by immunoblotting analysis. The results showed that total protein levels of activated protein kinase (AMPK) were gradually up-regulated with the prolonged fasting time (Figures 4A,B).",a1eac1be-c737-4a52-8668-db2c73be4d9f

Quantitative RT-PCR results revealed that the expression of lipid synthesis genes did not significantly change after activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation by Acadesine treatment, but exhibited a decreased trend after activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibition by Dorsomorphin (compound C) treatment (Figures 5A–C).",b3122177-1a22-49ac-8e3e-4c41236bd61c

In addition, as shown in Figures 5D–F, TG catabolism key gene Atgl (adipose triglyceride lipase) and FA oxidation key gene Cpt1a (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) were elevated, but the lipid catabolism related gene Hsl was decreased in the presence of activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator Acadesine. Conversely, the expression patterns of these genes were reversed when inhibition of activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, indicating that lipid catabolism is enhanced by the activation of activated protein kinase (AMPK).",2ff75afd-ec62-4849-8ba6-c679a14ceeb9

Fasting Promotes PPARγ Expression in High fat diet (HFD) Mice  As bioinformatics analysis predicted that PPARγ is a potential transcription factor for Cidec expression, we proposed that PPARγ might regulate the transcription of Cidec under the fasting condition, leading to the lipid droplet fusion and volume change. To this end, we examined the protein expression of PPARγ following fasting in the liver of High fat diet (HFD) mice.",e12d6fd6-4266-49b4-b4b2-c95c3f8e2899

Then, AML12 cells were treated with activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator and inhibitor to detect the transcript levels of PPARγ and Cidec. We observed that PPARγ expression was decreased but Cidec expression was increased after treatment with both activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator and inhibitor (P < 0.05; Figures 6C,D), suggesting that activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the upstream regulator of Cidec and PPARγ in AML12 cells.

23,discussion0," During fasting, liver enters a state of physiological steatosis and lipids are stored in the lipid droplet for energy provision to exert vital cellular functions (18, 19). At this time, hepatic triglyceride is synthesized by the non-esterified fatty acids from the hydrolysis of triglyceride stored in adipose tissue, dietary fatty acids from intestinal celiac residues, and newly synthesized fatty acids through lipogenesis (19). Proteomic analysis of hepatic lipid droplets under different nutritional conditions demonstrates that the abundance of proteins in the lipid droplets varies dramatically between fasting and refeeding mice, with altered metabolic properties of the liver. In addition, the morphological properties of lipid droplets are dynamically regulated by the metabolic state of the liver, and lipid droplets may take a part in coordinating various metabolic activities within hepatocytes (20).",bd401d3d-ae5c-4476-acf7-e78450829b43
24,discussion1," In line with these previous studies, we found that lipid droplet was accumulated in the liver of obese mice after fasting, accompanied by the elevated expression of Cidec.  Cidec has been found to regulate the fusion of small multi-compartmental lipid droplets to large uni-compartmental ones (21). On the contrary, adipocyte-specific knockdown of Cidec leads to the increased lipolysis (22, 23). Concordantly, knockout of Cidec in mice increases the number of lipid droplets in white adipocytes, and thus protects mice from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. During lipid droplet fusion, Cidec interacts with Plin1 through the CIDE-N terminus at the nascent lipid droplet contact site to promote lipid transfer and single-compartment lipid droplet formation (24). Also, the CIDE-C terminus is essential during lipid droplet growth (25).",78a25789-ce65-4eac-97bb-c34f154db495
25,discussion2," In adipocytes, Cidec regulates the catalytic capacity of lipid-related enzymes, which in turn promotes lipid droplet morphological changes and lipolysis (26). For instance, Cidec prevents lipolysis by interacting with Atgl, a rate-limiting enzyme that modulates the lipolysis process (27). Consistent with the regulatory role of Cidec in lipid droplet growth, Cidec knockout mice are leaner and are protected from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Whereas overexpression of Cidec promotes triglyceride accumulation in adipocytes and hepatocytes (28). These studies demonstrate that Cidec is a key mediator of lipid droplet dynamics and that reduced expression of Cidec accelerates lipid utilization. Notably, in our study, the role of Cidec in the lipid droplet fusion was verified in the AML12 cells overexpressing Cidec and AML12 cells induced to starvation status, which suggests that both in vivo fasting and in vitro starvation result in the increased expression of Cidec.",e62849e7-9392-468a-a5dc-6a26903013d2
26,discussion3,"  Cidec expression is controlled by multiple signaling pathways, which are interconnected to form a transcriptional regulatory network. It has been found that Cidec transcription is up-regulated mainly through the cAMP/PKA-CREB-CRTC2 (CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2) signaling pathway to participate in the lipolysis during the initial phase of fasting in mice, and is down-regulated to produce energy by increased fatty acid supply during the late period of fasting (29–31). However, our findings showed that PPARγ expression is up-regulated in the liver of mice under fasting condition and starved AML12 cells, revealing the relationship between the expression of PPARγ and Cidec, which is consistent with previous studies that growth hormone regulates lipolysis by activating MEK/ERK and STAT5-dependent signaling pathways to inhibit Cidec expression, in coordination with PPARγ transcriptional activity,",b4413af2-a3aa-47bf-8aab-d054600e6969
27,discussion4," as well as Cidec is transcriptionally controlled by PPARγ during adipocyte differentiation.  activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase complex that is widely expressed in almost all eukaryotes (32, 33). Activated activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a dual function on cellular metabolism when cells sensitize the stress and reduced ATP levels. activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation inhibits anabolic pathways to reduce ATP consumption, including the synthesis of lipid, sterol, glycine, RNA, protein, as well as the cell cycle, and promotes catabolic pathways to replenish ATP, including autophagy, glucose uptake and utilization, mitochondrial biosynthesis, and lipid utilization (34). activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates gene transcription through several different pathways in response to glucose starvation and oxidative stress.",09eaf2d6-eeae-4671-b71f-ddc782a43b31
28,discussion5," In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, glucose starvation activates activated protein kinase (AMPK), which then induces the expression of antioxidant genes such as catalase, Sod2 and Ucp2 via PPARγ and PGC-1α (35). activated protein kinase (AMPK) is also required for upregulation of PGC-1α via p38 in cancer cells, thus promoting mitochondrial biogenesis (36). In addition, increased ROS induced by glucose starvation further activates the LKB1-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, hence promoting autophagic degradation of Keap1 (keloid epichlorohydrin-associated protein 1) (37). In our study, we discovered that activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its phosphorylation levels were significantly upregulated in the liver of High fat diet (HFD) mice after fasting and starved AML12 cells, in agreement with the notion that energy deficiency can induce an increase in activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression both in vivo and in vitro.",c76124e1-7353-41bd-be50-49d6460b23d5
29,discussion6," Insulin resistance has been reported to cause the increased expression of Cidec and promote the translocation of Cidec into the nucleus to interact with activated protein kinase (AMPK)α2 (38). Also, upregulation of Cidec in adipocytes is accompanied by a decrease in activated protein kinase (AMPK)α level, which promotes the differentiation of adipocytes (39).  To sum up, our findings provide several lines of evidence demonstrating that fasting drives the lipid droplet accumulation in obese mice, which is mediated by the activated protein kinase (AMPK)-PPARγ-Cidec signaling axis, contributing to understand the molecular basis of the fasting effect on the obesity and develop the feasible strategies to prevent and treat the obesity in humans.
