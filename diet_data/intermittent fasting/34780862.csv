0,results0," After the removal of duplicates, we screened 5074 records (Fig. 1). Of sixty-eight full texts assessed for eligibility, eight studies met the inclusion criteria. The excluded records read in full text can be found in Supplementary Appendix 2. Fig. 1. Flow diagram of the literature selection process.  Description of the included studies  The characteristics of the included studies are summarised in Table 1. The included studies were published between 2006 and 2020. Three studies were RCTs and the remaining studies were uncontrolled before after (UCBA) studies. One was designed as an RCT(47), but we treated it as a uncontrolled before after (UCBA) study with two eligible intervention arms because it lacked an eligible control group: there was a high-fat diet group, consisting of 45 % of energy as fat, and a low-fat diet group, with 25 % of energy as fat. Six studies were from the USA, one was from England and one was from China.",e461387f-6e8d-48bb-9b63-d03ccf90f824
1,results1," Across the studies, there were 456 participants at baseline, of which the majority were women. Two studies consisted of only women(16,47). The age ranges were 18–65 years and the mean age was from 34 to 48 years. The mean BMI was between 26 and 38 kg/m2. The studies included participants from multiple ethnic backgrounds. Table 1.

Fat, carbohydrate and protein composition of diet on fast days differed between studies, being 24–45 %, 30–60 % and 15–37 %, respectively. In all eight studies, food was provided on fast days. Across the studies, the intervention duration was from 8 to 24 weeks. While the five uncontrolled before after (UCBA) studies(22,47,49–51) had no comparison groups, two RCTs had CER diet as the control group(16,31) and the control group in the last RCT had no specified diet(48).

As per our inclusion criteria, all eight studies assessed feelings of appetite. Specifically, all eight studies assessed hunger, seven assessed fullness(16,22,31,47,48,50,51), four assessed satisfaction(31,47,48,51) and one study assessed desire to eat(16). Except for the study by Johnson et al.(49) that used a numeric rating scale (from 1 = not at all to 10 = extremely), all studies used visual analogue scales (VAS) for subjective appetite measurements (from 0 mm = not at all to 100 mm = extremely).",482fd8ca-0699-4f61-a111-30d09c7b7bbe
9,results9," Only one study stated that a validated electronic system was used for quantification(16). In three studies, appetite rating assessments were measured pre-prandial, immediately after consumption and post-prandial(16,22,50). Therefore, area under curve (AUC) values were available for these studies. Our secondary outcome was body weight and all eight studies examined either body weight or body weight changes.  Risk of bias of the included studies  The risk of bias assessments are summarised in Figs. 2 and 3. With respect to the three RCTs, two RCTs gave no information about blinding of participants and providers(31,48). For the same two studies, there was also some concern with respect to high loss to follow-up (attrition bias). Thus, overall, we judged that these two RCTs(31,48) had high risk of bias while the study by Beaulieu et al.(16) had low risk of bias.",1e0f1a8e-28d8-47ea-88f2-fd0329fb803f
10,results10," In that study, the outcome assessors remained blinded to the diet allocations throughout the entire intervention and the participants were not aware of the true aims of the study.(16) For the five uncontrolled before after (UCBA) studies, there was some risk of bias with respect to performance bias and incomplete outcome data. Thus, for the primary outcome, we judged that all had high risk of bias, and all except Klempel et al.(47) had high risk of bias also with respect to the secondary outcome. Fig. 2. Risk of bias assessments of the included RCTs.  Fig. 3. Risk of bias assessments of the included uncontrolled before after (UCBA) studies.  Effects of Alternate day fasting (ADF) on appetite  With respect to hunger, none of the RCTs detected a significant difference between Alternate day fasting (ADF) and the control group at the 12 weeks follow-up (Table 3).",3f7c754e-2e5f-47e6-b796-d9c76471868e
11,results11," While three of the uncontrolled before after (UCBA) studies found no significant difference from baseline to follow-up, in the two studies by Klempel et al.(47,51), hunger decreased significantly from baseline to follow-up (Table 4, Fig. 4).

14,results18," Values are reported as mean and standard error of the mean.  Concerning fullness, none of the RCTs found a significant difference between the groups. In the study by Beaulieu et al.(16), although they found no significant difference between groups in their intention-to-treat analysis, as shown in Table 3, in their completers analysis, there was an increase in fullness area under curve (AUC) after the intervention (MΔ = 781 (95 % CI −0·2, 1563) mm × min, P = 0·05) and a difference between groups, with Alternate day fasting (ADF) having greater fullness overall than CER (MΔ = 1555 (95 % CI 46, 3064) mm × min, P = 0·04). Of the uncontrolled before after (UCBA) studies, two found no significant changes while the other two found somewhat contradictory changes (Table 4, Fig. 4). While Hoddy et al.(22) detected a significant increase from baseline to follow-up, Klempel et al.(47) detected a significant increase in the low-fat diet group but a significant decrease in the high-fat diet group.",8506b013-e25a-4f2f-a603-04b91a2b0d9a
15,results19,"  Four studies reported on satisfaction. Neither of the two RCTs found a significant difference between the groups at follow-up. Both studies by Klempel et al.(47,51) found a significant increase in satisfaction from baseline to follow-up, except for in the low-fat diet group, which had no significant change during the intervention period (Table 4, Fig. 4).  Only one study reported on desire to eat. The RCT by Beaulieu et al.(16) found no significant difference between the Alternate day fasting (ADF) group and the CER group (Table 3).  Effects of Alternate day fasting (ADF) on body weight  As seen in Table 3, for body weight, none of the RCTs found a significant difference between the Alternate day fasting (ADF) group and the control group at 12 weeks follow-up. The five uncontrolled before after (UCBA) studies all detected a significant decrease in body weight from baseline to follow-up (Table 4).",4fe64283-39a4-4dd7-9593-89be085e8452
16,results20," Overall, across 8–10 weeks, body weight decreased from 3·7 kg to 8·5 kg (mode 4·4 kg) (Table 4). Kalam et al.(50) had the longest follow-up and detected similar decreases at 3 months follow-up (5·3 kg) and at 6 months follow-up (6·2 kg) (Table 4).

19,discussion0," This systematic review advances the evidence on the effects of Alternate day fasting (ADF) for overweight and obese patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review with a focus on the effects of Alternate day fasting (ADF) on subjective feelings of appetite for overweight and obese adults. There are numerous reviews that summarise the effects of intermittent energy restriction (IER) approaches and also just Alternate day fasting (ADF) on body weight, our secondary outcome(20,24,25,28–30,52–56). Our findings are in line with these previous reviews and document that there is no conclusive evidence, but that positive short-term effects of Alternate day fasting (ADF) are indicated for body weight.  The included RCTs found neither significant unfavourable effects, such as increases in the feelings of hunger, nor significant benefits of Alternate day fasting (ADF) over CER for any of the outcomes after 3 months.",c0523126-7d87-42e7-b43a-97ca071ba443
20,discussion1," Meanwhile, some of the uncontrolled before after (UCBA) studies detected some significant improvements during the intervention period, most notably in body weight. Mirroring results in two related systematic reviews(28,55), with respect to body weight, all the included studies in our systematic review showed reductions in the range of 3–9 kilos during the intervention period. For dietary interventions, The American Dietetic Associations' Adult Weight Maintenance Evidence Based Nutrition Practice Guideline recommends an optimal weight loss target of 0·5–1 kg per week for the first 6 months(57), which is in line with the findings of our review. Typically, diet-induced weight loss in overweight and obese adults is accompanied by an increase in hunger and desire to eat, and a decrease in fullness and satisfaction(11,58,59).",02232346-419e-4702-a716-2a75e7c6226b
21,discussion2," Our results suggest that it is uncertain whether Alternate day fasting (ADF) has an effect on the typical subjective feelings of appetite associated with dietary prescriptions, and further research is needed to understand the effects of Alternate day fasting (ADF) better.  Overall completeness and applicability of the evidence  The certainty of the evidence for all outcomes in this systematic review is generally very low, and the results must be interpreted cautiously. This is mainly because five of the eight studies had no control group, most studies had considerable risk of bias and there was imprecision in effects. Across the eight studies, sample sizes were small, and in total, there were only 456 study participants. Some of the included studies may have been inadequately powered to detect differences as only two studies reported power calculations(16,50). Only one included study followed participants beyond 3 months and results beyond this time are uncertain.",319a04c2-deac-4b4d-b818-8066b4f7e167
22,discussion3," We note, however, that Kalam et al.(50) had 6 months follow-up, with results being similar at 3 and 6 months. Furthermore, we included only studies on adults with overweight or obesity of BMI ≥25 kg/m2, receiving Alternate day fasting (ADF) consisting of a cyclical feeding pattern with a fast day (0–25 % of the individuals' daily energy needs) alternated with a feast day. Yet, there were considerable heterogeneity in sample and intervention characteristics, including various Alternate day fasting (ADF) components such as prescribed energy intake, macronutrient composition, timing of consumption of foods during fast days and provision of additional dietary counselling. The transferability of the findings is therefore uncertain. Consistent with similar reviews(55,60), participants were predominantly female, which supports the assertion that there is a gender imbalance with respect to weight management programme engagement.",4632d894-759e-4943-9422-7fc77838aab7
23,discussion4,"  Implications  The very low certainty of evidence on the effects of Alternate day fasting (ADF) for overweight and obese patients prevents strong recommendations. Therefore, Alternate day fasting (ADF) should be offered cautiously in clinical practice while concomitantly evaluating outcomes important for patients. Given the complexity of weight management, it is unlikely that a ‘one size fits all’ approach will work.  Prior to recommending Alternate day fasting (ADF) to overweight and obese patients, more trials are needed to be certain of its benefits. Patient groups should be involved in Alternate day fasting (ADF) implementation and evaluation, to maximise the potential for modification and ultimately effect.",46ae4535-fe16-4ea3-be36-c0f4b1f5c03f
24,discussion5," For example, examining the adherence to Alternate day fasting (ADF) in relation to cognitive, environmental, psychological, and physiological factors and identifying barriers and facilitators will help to better comprehend the effects of Alternate day fasting (ADF) and assess feasibility. Similarly, evaluations of the impact of Alternate day fasting (ADF) on appetite hormones such as ghrelin, PYY or glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and ketone bodies during weight loss and weight maintenance are needed. Our systematic review suggests that this is an important area for further research. Although all the included studies assessed Alternate day fasting (ADF) consisting of a cyclical feeding pattern with a fast day alternated with a feast day, the macronutrient compositions of the Alternate day fasting (ADF) intervention differed across the studies.",78a38012-b80c-489c-9f19-e57742d28b8f
25,discussion6," In order to allow for comparisons among studies and to translate the research evidence into practice, there is a need to standardise the key elements of Alternate day fasting (ADF), as well as to harmonise outcomes and improve reporting of studies examining these outcomes. Future trials of Alternate day fasting (ADF) should average measurements taken from consecutive feed and fast days throughout the day to attain accurate assessments. This systematic review advocates for methodologically rigorous, adequately powered, long-term, large-scale RCTs conducted in different settings with diverse populations in preferably free-living conditions.  Strengths and limitations  Our systematic review was conducted in accordance with international guidelines for systematic reviews, the researchers are experienced in conducting systematic reviews, and one researcher is a registered dietician with long and diverse experience.",00989c29-bb07-4124-b5db-76e160359c7e
26,discussion7," As encouraged by others, due to the limited number of Alternate day fasting (ADF) studies published to date(55,61), we included not only RCTs, thus preventing a potential loss of critical information. However, we excluded conference abstracts, studies with no accessible full-texts, and studies in languages other than English, and it is possible that relevant studies have been missed and or have been published after our search. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity and missing and differentially reported outcome data, we could not conduct meta-analyses.  Conclusion  This systematic review found low to very low evidence on the effects of Alternate day fasting (ADF), in comparison to CER and ad libitum diet, on subjective feelings of hunger and body weight for adult patients with overweight and obesity.",be7c5951-1649-4fd7-b393-5e590691a2f8
27,discussion8," Additional trials are needed to be certain of the benefits of Alternate day fasting (ADF), and if offered in clinical practice, it should be offered cautiously while concomitantly evaluated. Despite the high interest in Alternate day fasting (ADF), good quality evidence is still needed to determine its effectiveness.  Acknowledgements  B.
