0,methods0," Experimental animals.  The inbred Dahl S (SS/Jr) and Dahl R (SR/Jr) rat strains were used. Dahl S and Dahl R rats are widely used preclinical models for genetic susceptibility and resistance to hypertension induced by a high-salt diet, respectively (27, 28). The inbred strains of the Dahl S and Dahl R rat models were developed in our laboratory at the University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences (previous Medical College of Ohio) and have been maintained in-house since 1985 (29, 30). Due to the inherent propensity of the Dahl S strain to develop hypertension, both Dahl strains were bred and maintained on a low-salt diet (0.3% NaCl; Teklad diet 7034, Envigo). For experiments involving a high-salt diet, 2% NaCl was used (Teklad diet TD.94217).  In some experiments, due to the lack of pharmacological antagonists and mutant rats, mice genetically deficient in Gpr109a and Gpr41 were used.",1395c2c6-ef89-4c57-b101-45cd7d698243

2,methods2,"  All rodent pups were weaned between 28 and 30 days. For most experimental procedures, rats were at least 12 weeks of age; untreated rats used for the acute vascular function experiments in response to βHB were 7–8 weeks old. Mice were at least 10 weeks of age when used. Only male rodents were used in the current studies. All rodents were maintained on a 12:12-hour-light/dark cycle and were allowed access to both chow and water ad libitum, unless specifically fasted (see Treatments below). Euthanasia of rodents was performed by thoracotomy, and exsanguination via cardiac puncture was performed under isoflurane anesthesia, administered via nose cone (5% in 100% O2), consistent with the 2013 American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. All euthanasia and tissue harvesting were performed in the Department of Laboratory Animal Resources from 0900 to 1100 on experimental days.",f9b7927e-2d6c-44f0-98ef-1accb7593c7c
3,methods3,"  The sample size per experiment (see figure panels and legends) is the number of independent rodents used, respective of strain and treatment group. Previous work from our laboratory estimating a large effect size (Cohen’s d > 0.8), as well as power analysis (desired power of 0.80 to 0.85 with a probability of a type I error of 0.05), has provided a basis for the projected number of rodents required per experimental group.  Treatments.  To understand the mechanisms of endogenous βHB biosynthesis, Dahl S and Dahl R rats of at least 12 weeks of age were randomly assigned to a 24-hour fast or allowed continued access to the low-salt chow (nonfasted). Both groups continued to have free access to drinking water. Some nonfasted and fasted rats were also randomized to receive intraperitoneal injections of lysosome acidification inhibitor CQ (50 mg/kg) (MilliporeSigma), or AMPKα inhibitor, dorsomorphin (25 mg/kg) (MedChemExpress), immediately prior to food withdrawal.",624d6c80-0a79-4b58-9d56-43a4914f5b95

To understand the consequences of a high-salt diet on hepatic autophagy and βHB biosynthesis, Dahl S and Dahl R rats were switched to the high-salt diet at 5 weeks of age and maintained on this diet until 13 weeks of age. To understand if reconstitution of βHB bioavailability could prevent the vascular damage induced by high-salt diet, groups of Dahl S and Dahl R rats were administered 1,3-BD (MilliporeSigma) in their drinking water (20% v/v), as we have performed previously (14).  βHB measurement.

13,results0," Evolutionarily, autophagy serves to mobilize nutrients in times of starvation, including substrates for ketogenesis (11). Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of autophagy would prevent βHB biosynthesis in response to a 24-hour fast. Treatment with the lysosome acidification inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) impeded the starvation-induced increase in βHB in both Dahl S (Figure 1A) and Dahl salt–resistant (Dahl R) rats (Figure 1B). A major upstream regulator of starvation-induced autophagy is the energy sensor 5′ adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of AMPKα would similarly prevent βHB generation after a 24-hour fast. Treatment with dorsomorphin, an ATP-competitive AMPKα inhibitor, also blocked the starvation-induced increase in βHB in both Dahl strains (Figure 1). These data suggest that βHB biosynthesis is dependent on AMPKα-induced autophagy.",c0d749af-e12f-4ff3-bd27-22aa50636eb9
14,results1,"  Next, we questioned whether βHB could contribute to the beneficial effects of autophagy by exerting vasoactive effects. We have discovered for the first time to our knowledge that βHB is a potentially novel, liver-derived vasodilator. Specifically, when we administered βHB directly to isolated mesenteric resistance arteries from Dahl S and Dahl R rats, βHB caused potent relaxation (Figure 2A) but not contraction (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.149037DS1).",bbdd7738-eeb0-43ab-b06e-e4d86533ba68
15,results2," Denudation of some arteries demonstrated that βHB is predominantly an endothelium-dependent vasodilator (Figure 2B and Supplemental Figure 2A), and inhibition of specific endothelium-derived vasodilators revealed that this relaxation was primarily mediated by potassium channels (Figure 2, C and D, and Supplemental Figure 2, B and C) and not by nitric oxide (Figure 2E and Supplemental Figure 2D), cyclooxygenase (Figure 2F and Supplemental Figure 2E), or changes in extracellular pH (Figure 2G). Additionally, this relaxation was not dependent on AMPKα, as incubation with dorsomorphin actually enhanced relaxation (Supplemental Figure 3, A and B).",4dc3f802-3732-43ad-89b8-f271b5a09248
16,results3," Investigation into specific potassium-dependent hyperpolarizing factors suggested that relaxation in response to βHB (1 nmol/L) was primarily mediated by small and intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channels and sodium/potassium ATPase, as relaxation was significantly attenuated by UCL 1684 and TRAM-34 (combined) and ouabain (Figure 2H). To support the potassium dependency of βHB-induced vasodilation, we also performed concentration-response curves in aortic segments. In physiological conditions, it is well established that vasodilation in the aorta occurs primarily through nitric oxide–dependent mechanisms (16). We observed minimal relaxation (6.1% ± 0.4%) in response to βHB in aorta from Dahl R rats, and there was no difference with and without nitric oxide inhibition (Supplemental Figure 4). Overall, these data reveal that βHB is a potent liver-derived vasodilator, predominately of resistance arteries.",9a9ce1d7-04a6-4b31-9238-97ec3bca097c
17,results4,"  To further investigate the mechanism of βHB-induced relaxation, we needed to switch to a mouse model, as pharmacological antagonists for the classical βHB receptors Gpr109a and Gpr41 do not exist. Therefore, we obtained mice deficient in Gpr109a and Gpr41. As we expected, the vasodilation in response to βHB was conserved between rats and mice, but surprisingly, and, in opposition to our original hypothesis, there was no difference in the βHB-mediated vasodilation in mesenteric resistance arteries from Gpr109a–/– mice (Figure 3A) and Gpr41–/– mice (Figure 3B). These data reveal that βHB is causing vasodilation through a mechanism independent of its traditional GPCRs.  Previously, using an untargeted metabolomic approach, we reported that Dahl S rats fed a high-salt diet have less circulating βHB after a 24-hour fast compared with Dahl S rats fed a low-salt diet (14).",5175e19d-82cc-400d-9dce-5495c6797abd
18,results5," In the current study, we have repeated these findings in Dahl S rats and observed the same phenomenon in normotensive Dahl R rats fed a high-salt diet (Figure 4A). This observation is important because it indicates that the diminished βHB biosynthesis after a 24-hour fast is not due to high blood pressure but actually due to the effects of a high-salt diet on the liver function. As a result, we hypothesized that a high-salt diet for 8 weeks would be associated with decreased autophagic activity in liver biopsies from Dahl S and Dahl R rats. We observed that, in liver biopsies from low-salt diet–fed Dahl S and Dahl R rats, there were increases in the ratio of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B II (LC3B-II) to LC3B-I after a 24-hour fast, indicative of LC3B lipidation and enhanced autophagic activity. However, in high-salt diet–fed Dahl S and Dahl R rats, there was a lowered LC3B-II/LC3B-I ratio after a 24-hour fast (Figure 4B).",edcb90ac-5e8b-4b95-ae6c-b3e23c600971
19,results6," See complete unedited blots in the supplemental material. In order to support this notion, we probed for the expression of p62 (also known as sequestosome 1). p62 is an autophagy substrate that can be used as a reporter of autophagic activity. Specifically, active autophagy leads to a decrease in p62 expression; conversely, inhibition of autophagy maintains p62 expression. We observed a significant decrease in p62 expression in liver biopsies from low-salt diet–fed Dahl S rats, and this decrease did not occur in high-salt diet–fed Dahl S rats (Supplemental Figure 5). Again, this supports the conclusion that a chronic high-salt diet leads to impaired autophagic activity. These changes in βHB and expression of representative autophagy proteins after a high-salt diet were not associated with liver fibrosis (Figure 4C), fatty liver (Figure 4D), traditional enzymatic markers of liver damage (Figure 4, E and F), or dysfunctional cholesterol metabolism (Figure 4G).",3b3a77f2-64e9-404b-a592-0b9451ce69b9
20,results7," On the other hand, nonfasting circulating triglycerides (Figure 4H) and glucose (Figure 4I) were higher in high-salt diet–fed Dahl S and Dahl R rats. Overall, these data suggest that a chronic high-salt diet decreases βHB biosynthesis and autophagy, possibly via elevated circulating energy substrates and not liver injury.  To increase βHB bioavailability chronically, in vivo, and in lieu of nutrient deprivation, the exogenous 1,3-butanediol (1,3-BD) is commonly administered in drinking water as a metabolic precursor. After consumption, 1,3-BD is catabolized by the liver into βHB (17). Interestingly, when we administered 1,3-BD directly to isolated mesenteric resistance arteries from Dahl S and Dahl R rats, we observed a potent relaxation (Supplemental Figure 6), similar to what we observed with βHB.",47dc2802-8854-496e-98e8-fe101e68536f
21,results8," Despite this to our knowledge previously unrecognized duel function of 1,3-BD, we wanted to know what happens to vascular function if we increase βHB bioavailability in conjunction with a high-salt diet. To answer this question, we added 1,3-BD (20%) to the drinking water of Dahl S and Dahl R rats fed a high-salt diet for 8 weeks. Previously, we confirmed that this concentration is sufficient to significantly raise serum βHB bioavailability in high-salt diet–fed Dahl S rats (14). While the magnitude of endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine in mesenteric resistance arteries from Dahl S rats was similar between treatments, we observed that a high-salt diet and 1,3-BD changed the mechanism of endothelium-dependent vasodilation.",4d4896cc-b36a-4446-9000-7ec0b0659646
22,results9," Specifically, a high-salt diet shifted the relaxation away from a solely nitric oxide–dependent mechanism (Figure 5A) to a combination of nitric oxide– and nitric oxide–independent mechanisms (Figure 5B); 1,3-BD treatment prevented the shift in the vasodilator mechanism in response to a high-salt diet and primarily maintained a nitric oxide–dependent vasodilation (Figure 5C). Activation of potassium channels is a well-established compensatory mechanism to maintain vasodilation in conditions of low nitric oxide bioavailability (18).",c0b8d762-2182-44eb-be70-541fcaaa0221
23,results10," In support of this dogma, we observed that the relaxation in response to acetylcholine in mesenteric resistance arteries from high-salt diet–fed Dahl S rats could be completely blocked by nonspecific potassium channel blockade and Nω-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (Figure 5, D and E), and application of specific inhibitors revealed that large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels were the major potassium channel contributing to this relaxation in high-salt diet–fed Dahl S rats (Figure 5F). Overall, these data demonstrate that maintenance of βHB bioavailability prevents the shift away from nitric oxide–mediated vasodilation in Dahl S rats on a high-salt diet.  In Dahl R rats, we observed that a high-salt diet decreased the sensitivity of isolated mesenteric resistance arteries to acetylcholine, and 1,3-BD treatment prevented this endothelial dysfunction (logEC50, Dahl R–low salt, –7.35 ± 0.05 vs. Dahl R–high salt, –7.19 ± 0.07 [P < 0.05] vs.",5280a1ff-ce20-4d65-9337-b65f430b43af
24,results11," Dahl R–high salt + 1,3-BD, –7.42 ± 0.10). Furthermore, when mesenteric resistance arteries were incubated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, only Dahl R rats on a high-salt diet presented with an increased sensitivity to acetylcholine (logEC50, high salt, –7.19 ± 0.07 vs. high salt + indomethacin, –7.66 ± 0.08; P < 0.05), indicating that 1,3-BD treatment decreased cyclooxygenase-induced vascular inflammation (logEC50, 1,3-BD, –7.42 ± 0.10 vs. 1,3-BD + indomethacin, –7.61 ± 0.09) (Figure 5, G–I). In summary, despite the strain differences in the mechanism of endothelial dysfunction after a high-salt diet, overall, these data indicate that maintenance of βHB bioavailability with 1,3-BD treatment prevents high-salt diet–induced endothelial dysfunction in Dahl S and Dahl R rats.",e9a376e9-a993-41ed-b93b-82ccb599cf8a
25,results12,"  Interestingly, upon termination of the chronic treatment of 1,3-BD for 8 weeks, we observed that treated rats from both strains were significantly smaller than vehicle-treated rats (both low- and high-salt diets) (Supplemental Figure 7A). Further investigation revealed that total body mass (Supplemental Figure 7, B and E), epididymal fat mass (Supplemental Figure 7, C and F), and tibia length (Supplemental Figure 7, D and G) were all significantly smaller in 1,3-BD–treated rats. Analysis of systemic ion concentration revealed an increase in the anion gap in 1,3-BD–treated rats, a clinical measure of metabolic acidosis (Supplemental Figure 8, A and H); hepatotoxicity, as indicated by systemic increases in liver enzymes (Supplemental Figure 8, B, C, I, and J); bile acids (Supplemental Figure 8, D and K); bilirubin (Supplemental Figure 7, E and L); and hemoconcentration, as indicated by albumin (Supplemental Figure 8, F and M).",76622e5b-7dea-4ee9-b186-29b52b3f1d8c
26,results13," Metabolically, we observed that 1,3-BD treatment significantly reduced nonfasting blood glucose and serum triglycerides to levels that were similar to those of rats that underwent a 24-hour fast (Supplemental Figure 7, B and E, and Supplemental Figure 9, A and D). On the other hand, 1,3-BD treatment significantly lowered circulating total cholesterol in Dahl S rats (Supplemental Figure 9C) but elevated it Dahl R rats (Supplemental Figure 9F). Collectively, these data suggest that 1,3-BD is a caloric restriction mimetic that improves cardiometabolic health in rats on a high-salt diet. On the other hand, it also has deleterious side effects at the dose used in the current study, including stunted growth, metabolic acidosis, and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, we acknowledge that the dose used in the current study is a limitation, and future work will focus on optimizing this dose for translational application.

27,discussion0," Precisely how autophagy is vasculoprotective and ameliorates vascular damage is the focus of intense and rigorous research (4–6). Until now, most of the important discoveries surrounding autophagy and vascular physiology are centered on the premise that reduced autophagy leads to the accumulation of damaged cellular debris and dysfunctional organelles that causes inflammation and oxidative stress. Subsequently, this proinflammatory/prooxidative milieu quenches nitric oxide bioavailability (7, 8) and also uncouples endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (19). Therefore, upregulation/reconstitution of autophagy decreases these vascular dysfunctions. While these rigorous studies have provided an important phenotypic understanding of how autophagy can ameliorate vascular function and structure, most of these studies have attempted to upregulate autophagy in the vasculature by using systemic interventions (e.g., lifestyle modifications or pharmacological agents administered orally).",45bd370e-75fa-4d1e-aa58-f2ff8c10f926
28,discussion1," Therefore, these studies cannot rule out other organ systems contributing to the vascular phenotypes measured.  Here, we reveal for the first time to our knowledge that βHB is an autophagy-sensitive metabolite from the liver that can cause vasodilation via potassium channels. This work is paradigm shifting, as it offers an alternative mechanism to the antiinflammatory and antioxidative stress hypothesis of autophagy-induced vasculoprotection and it posits a reason as to why systemic interventions that elevate autophagy, such as intermittent fasting and exercise, are healthful. In this investigation, we also reveal for the first time to our knowledge that a high-salt diet decreases autophagy and offer one mechanism by which βHB is negatively regulated. While the precise mechanisms as to how high salt negatively regulates autophagic activity need to be confirmed, we suggest that this related with metabolic dysfunction and excess availability of energy substrates (i.e.",6891c20b-4f96-42d0-8a7d-56e6b4dd19be
29,discussion2,", hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia), as opposed to overt liver damage. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the decreased autophagy phenotype is translationally significant, as 90% of Americans exceed recommendations for salt consumption (20), and excess salt consumption is responsible for 1 of every 10 cardiovascular deaths (21). Moreover, our data reveal that the adverse effects of a high-salt diet on autophagy and βHB biosynthesis are independent of genetic susceptibility to salt-sensitive hypertension. Reconstituting βHB bioavailability, which would be analogous to chronic interventions that stimulate autophagy, prevented endothelial dysfunction caused by a high-salt diet. However, it should also be noted that 1,3-BD treatment also stunted growth and caused metabolic acidosis. Therefore, if 1,3-BD is to be promoted as a health-enhancing nutraceutical, the dosage needs to be titrated and optimized.",7bed1edd-1f1b-4c4e-844c-10b28ea36199
30,discussion3,"  Previous studies investigating autophagy-dependent vasculoprotection have suggested that autophagy increases or maintains nitric oxide bioavailability by decreasing reactive oxygen species generation (7, 8), increasing eNOS coupling (19), preventing the pathological switch from nitric oxide– to hydrogen peroxide–mediated vasodilation (22), and increasing P2Y purinoceptor 1 receptor–mediated activation of eNOS (23). In contrast to these reports, we observed that βHB is a nitric oxide–independent vasodilator, as nitric oxide synthase inhibition did not prevent βHB-induced vasodilation, but potassium channel inhibitors did.",10ed4d0f-e704-4b1d-a18c-11f8971a315a
31,discussion4," In support of our findings, it is well established that the contribution of nitric oxide to vasodilation decreases in resistance arteries and arterioles, and the contribution of nitric oxide–independent mechanisms to vasodilation increases, particularly potassium efflux (sometimes referred to as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor [EDH]), in cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension (16). Our current data are consistent with those of our previous report, in which we systemically administered the mTOR-independent autophagy activator trehalose and observed an improved endothelium-dependent relaxation via enhanced potassium-induced relaxation also in mesenteric resistance arteries (9).  Classically, βHB production is controlled by at least 2 nutrient-responsive pathways that are implicated in longevity (mTORC1 and FOXA2) and may be subject to regulation by βHB via histone deacetylase inhibition (15). Additionally, βHB can also signal via 2 known GPCRs.",82c4f7d4-8519-4810-83ce-56dc964d8b17
32,discussion5," βHB can activate Gpr109a, a high-affinity Gi/o-GPCR (24), and is generally recognized as an antagonist of Gpr41, another Gi/o-GPCR (25). However, there are conflicting reports on whether βHB functions as an antagonist or agonist for Gpr41 (26). In line with this, we hypothesized that βHB caused potent vasodilation via Gpr109a activation. To our surprise, mesenteric resistance arteries from mice deficient in Gpr109a still relaxed in response to βHB, as did arteries from Gpr41-deficient mice. Therefore, the mechanism by which βHB causes vasodilation still remains to be confirmed. An interesting phenomenon that was observed throughout our study was the biphasic response of βHB-induced vasodilation in mesenteric resistance arteries from Dahl S and Dahl R rats. Although the potent βHB-induced vasodilation of mesenteric resistance arteries appears conserved across rodent species, arteries from Dahl rats had a unique contractile response after the initial vasodilation (~1–10 nmol/L).",6dce3fe8-abba-4983-870f-80b799ccab83

This is a perplexing phenomenon, as βHB does not cause contraction in arteries at basal tone or in those minimally contracted with 26.2 mmol/L potassium chloride (KCl), which opens calcium channels (Supplemental Figure 1). Therefore, the contractile response appears to be dependent on the initial vasodilation/hyperpolarization, and it is not due to cyclooxygenase. Overall, the etiology of this biphasic response in Dahl rats still remains to be elucidated.  Furthermore, the vasodilation of isolated mesenteric resistance arteries in response to 1,3-BD, classically employed as a βHB precursor, has important consideration for studies that aim to reconstitute βHB bioavailability. Our results pharmacologically redefine 1,3-BD from solely a βHB precursor (17) to potentially a βHB mimetic as well.",7654f014-6058-47ff-bf2e-2d42d1416fc3
34,discussion7," Therefore, this duel action of 1,3-BD needs to be taken into consideration when interpreting studies (including ours) that seek to increase endogenous βHB bioavailability by administering 1,3-BD, as 1,3-BD has direct vasodilatory actions that are independent of its metabolism into βHB.  In summary, we have shown for the first time to our knowledge that βHB is an autophagy-dependent liver-derived relaxing factor that has direct vasodilating actions on the vasculature and that a high-salt diet can decrease its biosynthesis by interfering with autophagy. Therefore, this work reveals both a potentially novel mechanism by which autophagy is vasculoprotective and a pathogenic mechanism of decreased autophagic activity and vascular deterioration. Furthermore, these data suggest a health-promoting mechanism underlying interventions that raise ketone bodies (e.g., intermittent fasting or ketogenic diets).",53444da4-620f-4147-a27f-cff16d3b0c24
35,discussion8," Our results illustrate that βHB, the most physiologically abundant ketone body, can have direct vasodilatory actions. Therefore, enhanced vascular health after interventions such as intermittent fasting and ketogenic diets are not necessarily only a secondary effect of improvements in metabolic indices (e.g., glucose control and/or insulin sensitivity).
