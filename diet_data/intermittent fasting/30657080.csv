0,background0,"Gut microbiota consists of a group of microorganisms that live in the mammalian intestinal tract and plays key roles in health and disease. Gut microbiota is not only involved in a number of major physiological processes including fermentation of indigestible dietary polysaccharides and synthesis of essential amino acids and vitamins, but also is a vital factor in maintaining gut homeostasis for host [1]. However, a normal gut microbiota can be negatively affected by multiple environmental and host genetic factors and thus is converted into a dysbiotic state [2]. Due to various public health problems like metabolic syndrome and cancer that are associated with the dysbiosis of gut microbiota [2], restoring or promoting a healthy microbiota has been therefore regarded as one of promising approaches for the prevention and treatment of these health problems [3].  Intermittent fasting as an emerging dieting concept is usually practiced by restricting eating from 12 to 24 h (hrs).",72eea9bb-1c06-45f0-812d-05b3113180b3
1,background1," A great number of studies have provided evidence for health benefits of intermittent fasting to host [4–6]. The strategies of intermittent fasting can differ dramatically, for instance according to different daily hours of fasting. A well-known intermittent fasting pattern is Ramadan fasting, which entails abstinence from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset over a period of approximately 30 days during the month of Ramadan [7], and is being widely studied for its impact on human health and disease in population-based studies [8–10]. Another popular fasting pattern is every other day fasting, which has been shown to improve obesity and multiple sclerosis in experimental model through restoring gut microbiota [11, 12]. These studies indicate the promising potential of intermittent fasting in shaping gut microbiota. Obviously, daily fasting hours is varied across different studies, ranging between 12 to 24 h.",a6a5e505-03cd-48b0-8fab-ecfab30e184f
2,background2," However, how the length of daily fasting hours affect the outcome of fasting and gut microbiota still remains largely unclear so far.  To shed a light on daily fasting hours on gut microbiota, this study investigated the effects of 12, 16, and 20 h daily fasting for 1 month on gut microbiota in mice. By profiling fecal bacterial community with 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we found that intermittent fasting altered the gut microbiota, and the effect was more robust in mice treated with daily 16 h fasting.

13,results0,"Different fasting protocols on cumulative food intake C57BL/6 J mice were divided into three groups on the basis of daily fasting duration, as shown in Fig. 1a. Mice fed Ad libitum were used as control (control (CTR)). Food intake was measured for the indicated period of time. We found that cumulative food intake during the period of fasting (30 days) was significantly reduced in the 16 and 20 h fasting groups compared to control (CTR) (p < 0.0001), but was not changed in the 12 h group (Fig. 1b). Also, daily food intake was changed similarly during fasting (Fig. 1c; p < 0.05). One month after the cessation of intermittent fasting, in comparison to control (CTR), cumulative food intake was significantly increased in the 20 h fasting group but not in the 12 h and 16 h groups (Fig. 1d). Additionally, a very strong negative correlation (r = − 0.73, p < 0.0001) was found between the length of daily fasting time and cumulative food intake during fasting (Fig.",e3a818cd-1303-4b00-be82-c83e48157445

20,results8," To further identify microbiota taxa that account for the greatest differences between fasted and unfasted mice, we performed Liner Discriminate Analysis (linear discriminant analysis (LDA)) coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe). As shown in Fig. 3c, multiple taxonomic differences were found between 16 h daily fasting and control (CTR); pneumotype was enriched with operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the class Clostridia to the family Akkermansiaceae, and was reduced with the class unidentified_Bacteria and families including Rikenellaceae and Ruminococcaceae. At the genus level, a genus with higher abundance was Akkermansia, whereas Alistipes from family Rikenellaceae was reduced (Fig. 3c). However, these effects disappeared 1 month after the cessation of fasting (Fig. 3d).

22,discussion0,"Fasting, in particular intermittent and timing fasting, is being widely practiced for various purposes in global population, for at least millennia now. Recently, intermittent fasting is gaining scientific interest as a potential intervention to improve health [17, 18]. In this study, we hypothesized that gut microbiome is shaped to different extents by different daily fasting duration over a period of 30 days and our results are in line with this notion.  The duration of fasting has important effects on physiological and metabolic processes in human and animal models [19, 20]. A recent study has reported that daily fasting (13 h) improves health and survival in mice independent of diet composition and calories [14]. However, the study did not investigate changes in gut microbiota during fasting. In our study, we found that cumulative food intake was also not significantly affected in mice treated with 12 h daily fasting, but the composition of their gut microbiota was altered.",ed619062-cf45-4e55-a7a1-c2e9e2701811
23,discussion1," Our findings are consistent with a recent study conducted in obese mice that cumulative food intake was not affected by every other day fasting either, but has gut microbiota altered [21].  The gut microbiome is becoming increasingly recognized as an important host genome and plays a substantial role in maintaining physiological homeostasis [2, 22]. In turn, the resulting dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is highly associated with the pathogenesis of both acute or chronic diseases, in particular digestive disorders including inflammatory bowel disease, liver cirrhosis and colorectal cancer, and thus is responsible for the unrelenting increase in so-called diseases-of-affluence [23]. In this study, we have demonstrated that intermittent fasting for 30 days, even with 12 h daily fasting duration, is sufficient to alter the composition of gut microbiota.",04b9aad3-8a8d-41ea-8340-f2c35951b3db
24,discussion2," The results support the notion that fasting may become as an alternative strategy for more effective restoration of human gut microbiota composition.  The health benefits of intermittent fasting on aging, antioxidant stress, metabolism and cardiovascular disease have been demonstrated in human and animal studies [18, 24–27], but its effect on gut microbiota remains largely unclear. In our study, we found 30 days of daily fasting (16 h fasting) led to significantly increased level of Akkermansia and deceased level of Alistipes. Importantly, previous studies have demonstrated that increase in Akkermansia spp. is associated with metabolic improvements including decreased liver triglyceride accumulation and alleviated intestinal inflammation [28], and reduction in Alistipes might also improve intestinal inflammation [29, 30].",668e2974-b2a3-43b2-a828-d1fbdc109d20
25,discussion3," Taken together, these findings suggest that the beneficial effect of intermittent fasting on health is likely to be linked to gut microbiota alterations during fasting, with particular reference to increase in specific species frequently reported to be anti-inflammatory species and reduction in species often described as pro-inflammatory.  A remaining question of interest, however, is whether the readout of intermittent fasting under longer daily duration is due to fasting duration, reduction of food intake or both. This is also in favor of the mechanistic distinction between intermittent fasting and classical caloric restriction.  Conclusions We have demonstrated that intermittent fasting shapes the gut microbiota in healthy mice in a daily fasting hour dependent manner, and a magnitude effect of fasting was observed upon a 16 h fasting duration. However, these effects gradually disappear when the fasting is discontinued.",20ad1b31-f41e-4001-ae64-8b38ca44fe1c
26,discussion4, It must also be borne in mind that this study was only conducted in a small group of animals over a short period of time. Future research is hence needed to determine an optimal fasting regimen(s) that can provide long term beneficial effect. ,37b1d308-22e7-4e1f-8eb6-4f345d869812
