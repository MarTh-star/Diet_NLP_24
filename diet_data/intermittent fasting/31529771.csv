0,introduction0,"One of the grand challenges of our times is the rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome1. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by central obesity, insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure, high triglyceride, and low high-density lipoprotein levels2. Metabolic syndrome has adversely impacted many aspects of society3. Importantly, metabolic syndrome is a significant risk factor for several common cancers (e.g., liver, colorectal, breast, endometrium, pancreas)4,5.  Disrupted circadian clock rhythm has been recognized as one of the causes of metabolic syndrome and metabolic syndrome-induced cancers6–8. Pharmacologic treatments used for the components of the metabolic syndrome appear to be insufficient to reduce the risk of developing metabolic syndrome-induced cancers9.",b06c87fd-7b59-4b83-b696-550f34253693
1,introduction1," Moreover, pharmacologic treatments cannot reset the circadian clock rhythm; thus, there is an urgent need for an effective intervention to reset the circadian clock and prevent metabolic syndrome and metabolic syndrome-induced cancers. Animal studies showed that resetting the circadian clock by time-restricted feeding improves metabolic syndrome and inhibits the development of cancer10,11. Therefore, resetting the disrupted circadian clock in humans by consecutive daily intermittent fasting could provide a primary strategy to improve metabolic syndrome and reduce the incidence of metabolic syndrome-induced cancer10–12. Fasting during activity hours in contrast to the inactivity hours of the day appears to be important for the optimization of anticancer effect and gene expression.",d931acca-4713-4c45-950c-f48ca0f3eea1
2,introduction2," Mice with no access to food during the activity phase (dark phase) of a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle had a significantly slower tumor progression and higher survival compared with mice that had no access to food during the inactivity phase (light phase), and mice that had access to food ad libitum13. Consistent with these findings, an earlier murine study showed that the uncoupling of the peripheral clocks from the control of the central clock only occurred when mice had no access to food during the active phase14. In contrast, a minimal change in the phase of gene expression was observed when mice had no access to food during the inactive phase14, corresponding to night time in humans. The findings of murine studies should be interpreted in the context of the fact that humans are diurnal (activity occurs during daytime), and mice are nocturnal (activity occurs during nighttime).",8b306c2c-b086-4a6c-8dfc-ce67847d5b68
3,introduction3," The findings of these murine studies are in accord with the findings of our preliminary studies conducted in healthy subjects15. Our results showed that 30-day intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset, the human activity phase, was associated with an anticancer serum proteome response and upregulated several key regulatory proteins that play a key role in tumor suppression, DNA repair, insulin signaling, glucose, and lipid metabolism, circadian clock, cytoskeletal remodeling, immune system, and cognitive function15. Importantly, the increase in the levels of these critical regulatory proteins occurred in the absence of any significant weight loss and calorie restriction15. Several human studies showed beneficial effects of intermittent fasting (e.g., Ramadan fasting16–18), and time-restricted eating19 in subjects with metabolic syndrome.",b7f5801b-b009-406a-9387-0d420bb661bf
4,introduction4," However, in none of these studies, proteomic profiling was performed to understand the mechanism behind the anticancer effect of intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating in subjects with metabolic syndrome.  To this end, we hypothesized that intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset practiced exclusively during the human activity hours for four weeks would be associated with an anticancer serum proteome response, upregulate anticancer proteins and regulatory proteins of DNA repair and insulin signaling, and downregulate pro-cancer proteins.

11,methods6," We also explained the details of the gene protein product (GP)s quantification in our previous publication15.

The final quantificational value (FOT) represents the relative abundance of each GP. The final quantificational value (FOT) values of a particular GP in different conditions (e.g., final quantificational value (FOT) value of a GP before 4-week intermittent fasting and at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting) can be divided to get a fold change. final quantificational value (FOT) value also provides the relative quantification of different GPs in the same condition (e.g.",866c5198-c19d-414a-9e11-fb3eb29444b7

33,discussion2,"  Ramadan fasting is a unique form of intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset (dusk) without eating or drinking during the month of Ramadan based on the lunar calendar16 and has several major unique features: (1) Fasting is exclusively practiced during the human activity hours from dawn to sunset (dusk) and is for both eating and drinking, which differentiates the dawn to sunset intermittent fasting from the other forms of intermittent fasting where drinking and/or eating light meals are allowed during the fasting window; (2) Although the main meals are at the transition time zones of the day (pre-dawn breakfast and dinner at sunset), eating (e.g.",4ec7a7e9-73fe-42d7-a72c-683d6f9aa865
34,discussion3,", snacks) and drinking outside these transition time zones is allowed as long as it is within the non-fasting window; (3) There is no interventional calorie or energy restriction; (4) Daily fasting window is in synchrony with circadian rhythm and earth’s rotation on its axis because the daily fast starts at dawn (the first transition time zone of the day) after a pre-dawn breakfast and ends at sunset (dusk) (the second transition time zone of the day) with dinner; (5) Monthly fasting window is in synchrony with the moon’s rotation around the earth and lunar phases because the monthly fasting starts and ends when the new moon is sighted. It is surmised that this fasting pattern results in energy reserves being accessed without leading to micronutrient deficiencies due to replenishment after sunset.  Fasting during activity hours of the day appears to be of paramount importance in cancer prevention and treatment.",468c77b0-1833-4ffb-811b-a1fbf6980e56
35,discussion4," A study showed that mice with no access to food during the activity phase of a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle had a significantly slower tumor progression and higher survival compared with mice that had no access to food during the inactivity phase, and mice that had access to food ad libitum13. The highest anticancer response occurred in the mice with no access to food during the activity phase, and the worse outcome was in the mice that had access to food ad libitum13. There was a minor anticancer effect and no survival benefit in the mice with no access to food during the inactivity phase13. In regards to humans, a study conducted among 2413 women with breast cancer without diabetes mellitus showed that fasting equal to or longer than 13 h at night (the combination of inactivity and activity hours) was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence25. Of note, this study did not have control subjects who fasted exclusively during the activity hours (daytime)25.",5528fb71-416b-4ccd-94d6-408a8a508d22
36,discussion5," Altogether, these animal and human studies show that intermittent fasting either during daily activity or inactivity hours (with or without extending to activity hours) have an anticancer effect compared with ad libitum eating; however, the most robust anticancer response appears to occur when prolonged fasting is practiced exclusively during the activity hours13.  In accord with the findings of these murine and human studies13,25, we found a significant fold increase in the levels of specific tumor suppressor/anticancer proteins at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset and/or 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset, including calreticulin (CALR), calumenin (CALU), INTS6, kinase (KIT), ciliary rootlet coiled coil rootletin (CROCC), polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR), IGFBP4, and SEMA4B that are downregulated in several cancers resulting in cancer metastasis and poor prognosis (Table 2, Fig. 2).",96d52607-30d7-49a3-baea-504754f1962a
37,discussion6," The calreticulin (CALR) gene encodes for calreticulin, which is a calcium-binding protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus26. Cancer cells tagged by calreticulin on their surface stimulate an immunogenic cancer cell death by enabling their phagocytosis by the dendritic cells of the immune system which in turn triggers T-cell-mediated immune response27–29. Obeid et al.28 showed that anthracyclines translocate calreticulin to the tumor cell surface, and trigger immunogenic tumor cell death (“eat me” signal).  calumenin (CALU) gene encodes for calumenin, a calcium-binding protein that plays a significant role in the endoplasmic reticulum functions, including folding and sorting of proteins26. Calumenin is an inhibitor of cell migration and metastasis in several cancers30, e.g., hepatocellular30,31, pancreatic30, head and neck squamous cell32, and lung squamous cell33 carcinomas. INTS6 gene encodes for a DEAD box RNA helicase that has a motif of Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp26.",d10e5f68-db09-41d6-ba80-a405e4df3118
38,discussion7," It is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a significant tumor-suppressive role in hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate ca34,35. The induction of INTS6 gene was shown to suppress castration-resistant prostate cancer35. Mutations in kinase (KIT) are linked to several cancers26, and the loss of proto-oncogene c-kinase (KIT) expression has been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer36,37.  Several other anticancer GPs require elaboration. ciliary rootlet coiled coil rootletin (CROCC), also known as TAX1BP2, is a tumor-suppressor gene that was shown to suppress hepatocellular carcinoma via p38/p53/p21 pathway activation38. The downregulation of ciliary rootlet coiled coil rootletin (CROCC) was associated with poor survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after surgical resection38.",9616a030-cbbd-4fb2-a3b9-400be9e77da9

The upregulation of IGFBP4 (encodes for a protein that binds insulin-like growth factors I and II26), was shown to function as a potent tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma and delay tumor formation in prostate cancer cells41,42. SEMA4B is involved in protein-coding26 and encodes for a protein that inhibits tumor growth in non-small cell lung cancer43.  A significant fold-reduction in the levels of several tumor promoter/pro-cancer GPs was observed at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting and/or 1 week after completion of 4-week intermittent fasting.",6f5c0f13-52be-467a-9782-5ad2df4bc19e

Specialized DNA polymerases are ectopically overexpressed in several cancers, can function as an oncogene and enhance mutations induced by DNA damage44–46. Overexpression of polymerase kappa (POLK) has been reported in lung cancer45,47. polymerase kappa (POLK) overexpression contributes to cancer development by inactivating wild-type p53, and this was shown in lung cancer47. polymerase kappa (POLK) gene also plays a role in breast cancer48.",39a17dc9-d25e-497f-80c2-b66504cde077

Intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset for 4 weeks can play an important role in humoral defense against severe acute respiratory syndrome‐associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Calreticulin was shown to enhance IgG-mediated immune response when it is fused with spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV64. Recombinant fusion protein that combines calreticulin and SARS-CoV S protein 450–650 fragment had much higher immunogenicity when compared with SARS-CoV S protein alone64.",81ecaada-a46d-489b-8f2d-07189a4db925
43,discussion12," We found an average 16-fold increase in the calreticulin (CALR) GP level 1 week after completion of 4-week intermittent fasting compared with the level before 4-week intermittent fasting. Our findings, combined with the prior report from Qiu et al.64, suggest that 4-week IF can play an important role in humoral defense against SARS-CoV, and further studies are needed.  Intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset for 4 weeks induces key regulatory proteins of insulin signaling and improves insulin resistance Four-week intermittent fasting induced key regulatory proteins of insulin signaling, including VPS8, polymerase mitochondrial (POLRMT) and IGFBP5 at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting and PRKCSH 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting.",11cfb8ce-1595-4704-82f6-cef524c155e1
44,discussion13," The induction of VPS8, polymerase mitochondrial (POLRMT), and IGFBP5 GPs at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting preceded the significant reduction in insulin resistance estimated by HOMA-IR that occurred 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting. VPS8, a subunit of CORVET complex26, plays a critical role in integrin requiring cell adhesion and migration, and recycling of beta-1 integrins65. Integrins are transmembrane receptors connecting the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton of the cells and thereby acting as a sensor for cell adhesion66. An impaired integrin signaling in the extracellular matrix of skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver can lead to insulin resistance67. An intact skeletal muscle and beta-cell mitochondrial function is vital for insulin synthesis. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced oxidative capacity68.",2518cfce-4ad8-4a72-8f72-636f627c61ab
45,discussion14," polymerase mitochondrial (POLRMT) encodes for the mitochondrial RNA polymerase26 that plays a critical role in transcription in pancreatic beta-cells and insulin secretion in the pancreas69. As the loss of polymerase mitochondrial (POLRMT) results in severe mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac muscle70, a similar mitochondrial dysfunction should occur in beta-cells with the loss or dysfunction of polymerase mitochondrial (POLRMT), resulting in insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. IGFBP5 plays an active role in myoblast differentiation by binding to insulin growth factor II and upregulating its expression71.",1821fcc4-d3fd-496c-8ac0-c09ac2541e1e
46,discussion15," PRKCSH encodes for a protein called hepatocystin or 80K-H, which is a beta subunit of glucosidase II26  and substrate for protein kinase C26, that plays a key role in GLUT4 vesicle trafficking (translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane) in the insulin signaling pathway 72 by forming a complex with 80K-H Overexpression of the hepatocystin 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting is suggestive of improvement of insulin signaling through enhancement of GLUT4 vesicle trafficking. The upregulation of PRKCSH GPs coincided with the improvement in HOMA-IR 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting.  Association of 4-week intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset with autophagy and oxidative stress parameters Autophagy appears to be one of the mechanisms of intermittent fasting in cancer prevention73. Downregulation of the hepatocystin encoded by PRKCSH results in dysfunctional glucosidase II, and thereby increase in autophagy via mTOR dependent pathway74.",406f046e-087e-4add-9db6-a20dbe43ceb1
47,discussion16," The fact that we found reduction at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting and then 73-fold increase in PRKCSH GP level 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting is suggestive of increased autophagy during 4-week intermittent fasting and decreased autophagy with the subjects’ return to ad libitum eating (Table 2). Although it did not reach statistical significance, we found a reduction in multiple oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers as well as gamma-glutamyl transferase levels, suggesting glutathione repletion at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting (Table 1).  Intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset for 4 weeks upregulates proteins associated with prolonged longevity and DNA repair We observed an average sixfold increase in H2B histone GP levels 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting compared with the levels before 4-week intermittent fasting. Feser et al.75 demonstrated similar findings in yeast cells.",5864089f-a416-4f5d-99ad-7a451c445ee5
48,discussion17," They reported that histone proteins are lost in aging yeast cells, whereas histone protein overexpression and supplying extra histone proteins prolonged longevity75. Authors suggested that extra histone protein supply extends lifespan by providing a tighter chromatin packaging, and thereby restoring the transcriptional silencing that is lost in aging75. We also observed a significant positive correlation between H2B histone GP levels and high-density lipoprotein levels 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting (Supplementary Table 5). The association between high-density lipoprotein levels and longevity was previously reported76. Our findings of a significant positive correlation between H2B histone GP and high-density lipoprotein levels 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting shed light on the mechanistic understanding of the association between high-density lipoprotein levels and longevity.",b03e0ac1-272e-41f8-ba24-d6f2a4c9a5b2
49,discussion18," Besides the extended life span, the overexpression of histone proteins may also be associated with increased DNA expression and repair because irradiation-induced DNA damage was shown to downregulate histone gene transcription via the G1 checkpoint pathway77. Additionally, we observed an average 74-fold increase in the AP5Z1 GP level at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting compared with the level before 4-week intermittent fasting. AP5Z1 is a helicase that likely plays a role in the repair of homologous recombination DNA double-strand break26. A variant in the AP5Z1 gene was associated with extreme longevity in a genome-wide association study conducted among 75,000 participants of the UK biobank78.  Strengths and limitations The strengths of our study are as follows: (1) We performed a robust, streamlined proteomics method to quantify proteins in the human serum using nano UHPLC-MS/MS15.",78ce3fcb-c4d4-4d11-8aa6-504adda9fc4c
50,discussion19," With this unique proteomics method, we were able to recover more than 1000 GPs at the end of the 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting (Fig. 2A) and 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting (Fig. 2C); (2) We evaluated serum proteome simultaneously with the components of metabolic syndrome, lipid, and hepatic panels, and adiposity, oxidative stress, and inflammation biomarkers; (3) We assessed the carryover effect of 4-week intermittent fasting after switching to ad libitum eating. For this, we compared the GP levels measured 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting with the levels measured at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting. Several GPs that had a significant fold change at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting compared with the levels before 4-week intermittent fasting, did not have any significant fold change 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting compared with the levels at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting (e.g.",1a3438b7-5b00-4431-8af6-a13b5ff495e8
51,discussion20,", calumenin (CALU), cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP)) (Table 2). These findings suggest that intermittent fasting has a carryover effect on these proteins. On the other hand, several GPs that had no significant fold change at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting compared with the levels before 4-week intermittent fasting, had a significant fold change 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting compared with the levels at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting (e.g., PRKCSH, HIST1H2BA) (Table 2). These findings may suggest either decreased or delayed carryover effect of intermittent fasting on the proteome. There is also a possibility that intermittent fasting might have triggered a cascade of proteomic changes in a continuum that may not be explained by the assessment of the serum proteome at a single time point alone after intermittent fasting is stopped.",b981972c-1ae4-438b-924e-e663376d429c
52,discussion21,"  Several GPs that showed significant fold changes in subjects with metabolic syndrome had also shown similar changes (e.g., increase or decrease) at the end of 4th week during 30-day intermittent fasting (kinase (KIT), ciliary rootlet coiled coil rootletin (CROCC), DNTT, polymerase kappa (POLK), serglycin (SRGN), CLSTN1) and 1 week after 30-day intermittent fasting (PRKCSH, calumenin (CALU), SPECC1L, IGFBP4, MYH7, CDH6, H2B histone, PKP1, LRRC3, FGB, ENPP2) in our previous study conducted in healthy subjects although they had not reached statistical significance15.  The lack of caloric measurement by dietary assessment is one of the limitations of our study. The improvement in the components of metabolic syndrome could partially be explained by the significant weight reduction.",410e42aa-6698-43d0-bdb7-e98ff4ff7227
53,discussion22," Nonetheless, we did not find any significant correlation between log2 fold changes in the selected proteins (names are displayed in Table 2) and changes in weight, waist circumference and body mass index at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting and 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting compared with baseline suggesting that the effect of 4-week intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset on the proteomic changes was independent of weight reduction. Furthermore, our previous study conducted in healthy volunteers who fasted from dawn to sunset for 30 days showed the induction of an anticancer proteome in the absence of a significant weight change15. We estimated insulin resistance by HOMA-IR equation instead of performing an oral glucose tolerance test. A non-significant reduction in HOMA-IR at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting might be related to insufficient accuracy of the HOMA-IR equation in our study population.",9a21a5ca-8fc9-4efa-a144-d2f15a347b96
54,discussion23," HOMA-IR equation was found to have limited accuracy in adults between the ages 60 and 88 and subjects on insulin treatment (unless the glucose and insulin are in steady-state levels in subjects on insulin)79,80. Given the fact that 11 out of 14 study subjects were 60 years old or older and one subject was on insulin treatment, HOMA-IR might have underestimated the reduction in insulin resistance that occurred at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting. Nonetheless, there was a reduction in glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR levels at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting. Although these findings did not reach statistical significance, they provide additional evidence for the antidiabetic effect of the 4-week intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset.",56dfafcf-c66a-4124-a68a-c3b0611e2ad2
55,discussion24,"  Conclusions Serum proteomic signature of 4-week intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset for more than 14 h a day contributed to the mechanistic understanding of the effect of intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset on anticarcinogenesis, DNA repair, insulin signaling, humoral immunity and increased longevity in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Our findings suggest that intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset for four consecutive weeks, which is in synchrony with circadian rhythm and earth’s rotation can be an adjunct treatment in metabolic syndrome and should be tested in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome-induced cancers. Altogether, our findings are in line with the results of our earlier study of 30-day dawn to sunset intermittent fasting conducted in healthy subjects15 and lay the foundation data for a randomized, controlled clinical trial of dawn to sunset intermittent fasting in subjects with metabolic syndrome.",7b5137f8-b652-43f8-a36e-1bd5232663b5
