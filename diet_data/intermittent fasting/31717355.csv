0,introduction0,"A proper nutrition strategy is an important aspect of elite sport physical training, as nutrient availability can not only influence energy expenditure, body composition, and performance, but also the immuno-response to exercise. In the last few years, the study of intermittent fasting (IF) has gained great popularity. IF is a dietary strategy that requires individuals to totally or partially reduce caloric intake for periods that range from defined times within a day to 1–3 whole days per week. Traditionally, the most common examples of IF have been religious fasting, particularly the pattern of food abstention during Ramadan [1]. However, in the last decade, IF has been used specifically to improve body composition and health status in both healthy and obese populations [2–5].",332403b9-56c5-4e23-8b71-ddf5142c3bf4
1,introduction1,"  In sports, IF is not a popular strategy and is mainly linked to those athletes that follow the Ramadan restriction, in which the caloric consumption is allowed only during nighttime with a great influence on the circadian rhythm, hormonal regulation and also thermoregulation due to a limited fluid intake [6, 7]. However, a recent meta-analysis indicated that clear detriments were not observed in most physical performance parameters during Ramadan fasting [8]. In the same study, authors remarked that reduced physical performance during Ramadan may be caused by sleep disturbance and dehydration, and that these effects seem to be more pronounced in amateur than elite athletes. Despite this, it is well known that even small differences in performance are fundamental to determine the results of elite sporting events.",3a1f9e20-65bb-4346-a64d-4c4c39eabd54
2,introduction2,"  Moreover, due to the intensity of training sessions, elite athletes normally undergo cycles of physiological stress, which can perturb the immune system and promote inflammation [9, 10]. High intensity training, especially if conducted for longer than 90 min, temporarily impairs some immune variables (i.e. lymphocyte and neutrophils counts), leading to greater risk of illness and infection [11, 12]. In the last two decades, different strategies, including nutrition, have been tested to overcome the immunosuppressive response in athletes. Results from “immunonutrition” studies have, for example, highlighted the importance of carbohydrates and polyphenols to reduce the acute inflammatory response to exercise [13, 14]. In addition, nutrient availability can directly impact immune processes during exercise and recovery from intense exercise [15]. For instance, long-term reduction of energy intake has been associated with greater susceptibility to illness in Olympic athletes [16, 17].",d3cdd8d1-a53c-4c11-bd66-c137d3840773
3,introduction3," Fasting has been consistently shown to reduce inflammation [18]; however, its effect on the immune system is still elusive. As reported in a recent meta-analysis [19], performing intense exercise during Ramadan results in a variation of the immunological response, but further studies are required to explore its potential regulatory role on the immune system.  Time-restricted eating (time restricted eating (TRE)) is a particular form of intermittent fasting, during which the normal period of fasting is 12–23 h per day. time restricted eating (TRE) can be performed with or without caloric restriction, and in the latter, individuals are allowed to consume their normal energy intake as long as they adhere to the specified window of time.",5facda1f-e54c-463d-b9d4-2e0cc58b51e8
4,introduction4," We have recently demonstrated that 8 weeks of time restricted eating (TRE) does not impair muscular performance improvements in young untrained individuals performing resistance exercise training [20], can decrease fat mass and improve some health-related biomarkers (i.e. IL-6, TNF-α, Insulin, HDL-C, TG) in resistance-trained males [21], and does not impair lean mass gain or performance improvements in resistance-trained females [22].  To our knowledge, there is no evidence regarding the effect of time restricted eating (TRE) on endurance sports or the impact that this type of diet can have on the immune system. In endurance sports such as cycling, the power/weight ratio is a very important physical indicator for the athlete. The power expressed by an athlete reflects the speed of the race or the ability to climb a greater slope at the same speed.",372bfa16-6fbc-4e71-87f4-6548a0f484f8
5,introduction5," On the other side, lower body weight of the athlete can be an advantageous factor considering that a lighter cyclist spends less energy to maintain the same speed and therefore gets less tired; or, as climbing is the true essence of this sport, a lighter athlete should be faster during a climb. It therefore seems plausible that a dietary approach that allows weight loss, while maintaining the muscle functional characteristics, could be a winning strategy for endurance athletes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 4 weeks of time restricted eating (TRE), with a daily 16-h fast and 8-h feeding window, in a group of young elite cyclists. We hypothesized that time restricted eating (TRE) would reduce inflammatory markers and fat mass without affecting physical performance. ",95b56ffe-d7d8-42d6-a3fd-35b313442e3f

To be included in the study, subjects must have been cycling for at least three seasons in an elite team. Exclusion criteria were recent injuries, usage of steroids or corticosteroids or any other medical condition that could interfere with study procedures.

Each athlete used personal shoes with Kéo pedals; the height of the saddle has been positioned at the maximum level of comfort for each athlete and for the subsequent tests the same relative measure was always used. Heart rate was recorded every 30 s, with a Polar band heart rate monitor (Kempele, Finland). After applying a silicone mask to the face for the analysis of respiratory gases, subjects started the test. The protocol included: 1 min of warm up at 60 W, then 1 min at 100 W, after which intensity increased by 30 W every 60 s until exhaustion.  Three to 4 days later, subjects performed an endurance test at 45% of the previously calculated PPO to measure the same ventilatory parameters.",46d1cc5f-a377-4d2c-86c0-c5fd0fa5429b

In addition, heart rate (HR) was collected at each minute of the test. Each athlete was asked to refrain from intense training on the day before the test and to consume a light and simple meal 2 h before the test. On average, subjects consumed approximately 350–450 kcal with a prevalent carbohydrate content (~ 50–80 g); specifically, a light breakfast of bread, jam, and fruit juice was provided.

Diet During the recruitment phase, all subjects completed a validated 7-day food diary for athletes [25] which was analyzed by nutritional software (Dieta Ragionata 7.0) to estimate individual daily dietary intake. Based on the results from the food diary and specific energy and macronutrients requirements for athletes [26, 27], all athletes received the same 7-day diet plan, in which the caloric intake was set at 4800 kcal. The intervention dietary plan did not significantly differ from the athlete’s baseline regimen in terms of macronutrient intake, but the two intervention groups differed in the time window in which they consumed their meals (Table 2).

16,results0,"Body composition After 4 weeks, a significant time x diet interaction (p = 0.04) was observed in total body weight: the time restricted eating (TRE) group experienced a significant (p = 0.03) decrease total body mass of ~ 2% (from 67.04 ± 5.03 to 65.78 ± 4.93 kg) while no significant change was observed in the ND group (from 72.28 ± 6.24 to 72.50 ± 6.45 kg).

22,discussion0,"time restricted eating (TRE) is a particular intermittent fasting approach in which the total daily caloric intake is often not reduced but distributed in a different frequency of meals, with the normal duration of eating ranging from 1 to 4 h to 10–12 h. In sports, intermittent fasting studies have mostly focused on Muslim athletes during the Ramadan period, a practice that requires abstention from food and liquid throughout the day and consumption of meals at night [6, 7]. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has investigated the effect of time restricted eating (TRE) in a group of elite endurance athletes. Our data demonstrated that during 4 weeks of pre-season training, time restricted eating (TRE) allows for maintenance of fat-free mass and reduction of fat mass, promoting a diminution of total body weight. We confirm that time restricted eating (TRE) reduced anabolic hormones (such as IGF-1 and testosterone) without affecting fat-free mass or endurance sport performance.",cba542a6-cebc-4562-b500-1b7c154c8eaf
23,discussion1," In addition, it seems that time restricted eating (TRE) may exert a protective effect on some aspects of the immune system in the context of exercise training.  Body composition The time restricted eating (TRE) employed in this study was a 16/8 modality and consisted in 16 h fasting and 8 h feeding. We have recently demonstrated that the same time restricted eating (TRE) protocol used with resistance-trained athletes reduced total body weight and fat mass [21]. In the present study, we confirmed the positive effect of time restricted eating (TRE) on body composition. Total energy and nutrient intake were comparable between groups; for these reasons one possible explanation of the greater weight loss in the time restricted eating (TRE) group could be found in the increase in adiponectin. Adiponectin stimulates PGC-1α expression and mitochondrial biogenesis through the AMPK kinase [28], stimulating adipogenesis.",d260a5de-a762-4dc6-afc3-d07700ff11e7
24,discussion2," Lower levels of adiponectin are associated with obesity [29] and oxidative stress [30]; whilst elevated plasma concentration of this cytokine correlates with improved metabolism and resting energy expenditure [28, 31]. We have previously demonstrated that adiponectin levels increase after 8 weeks of time restricted eating (TRE) compared to a normal diet; and these results correlated with weight loss [21]. In the present study, the levels of adiponectin tended to increase (+ 33%) after time restricted eating (TRE) compared to a blunted response in the ND group (+ 8%). When data were normalized relative to body fat mass, the apparent difference was even more pronounced (time restricted eating (TRE) + 50%; ND + 5%). Thus, time restricted eating (TRE) seems to induce a rise in adiponectin which may contribute to the reduction in body fat observed after 4 weeks of treatment.",4b0c0772-8a98-440e-a3c3-59af43ee29d6
25,discussion3," We have however observed a reduction in Resting energy expenditure (REE) after time restricted eating (TRE) diet, which might seem a counterproductive adaptation. A decrease in Resting energy expenditure (REE) is a common result of weight loss programs that involve calorie restriction, and it normally correlates with a loss of fat free mass (FFM) and especially to changes in its composition [32, 33]. However, these studies are normally conducted in obese or overweight subjects not involved in any strenuous exercise program. In the present study, fat free mass (FFM) was maintained and thus cannot explain the observed reduction in Resting energy expenditure (REE). It is, however, possible that this reduction reflects a momentaneous thermogenic adaptation of body weight, as described by the mechanical model of Rosenbaum and Leibel [34], in which Resting energy expenditure (REE) decreases with initial weight loss.",066238ac-55a1-4cb5-bb2e-92ff9c06eb78
26,discussion4," It is possible that in athletes, in which body fat is very low, and the exercise energy expenditure is particularly high, even a small drop of body weight (i.e 2–3%) may perturbate energy homeostasis. It is also possible that during time restricted eating (TRE) protocol, subjects have slightly reduced their caloric intake, which might have increased the negative energy balance and reduced Resting energy expenditure (REE). Each participant was strictly supervised by the personal team dietitian which ensured the adherence to diet protocol in terms of feeding window and caloric intake. Unfortunately, we have not recorded the post treatment dietary assessment to confirm or exclude this possibility.  Another explanation through which time restricted eating (TRE) may have improved body composition is linked to circadian clocks. The circadian control of food intake is situated in the hypothalamus which is synchronizes to the solar light–dark cycle.",0315d177-7048-4867-a226-0b88d6ca2f53
27,discussion5," At the molecular level, the actions of specific genes (BMAL1, CLOCK) are deputed to control the cell-autonomous circadian rhythms. However, fasting and feeding alternation can directly impact daily circadian rhythms through the activation of mTOR, AMPK, CREB, and AKT, which are key regulators of metabolism and nutrient homeostasis [35]. A proper arrangement of nutrient intake and abstention can thus severely influence body metabolism. In a recent study, Yasumoto et al. [36] showed that a wrong pattern of feeding/fasting can desynchronize peripheral clocks inducing obesity and metabolic disorders in mice. It is plausible to assume that in our study, in which time restricted eating (TRE) subjects were forced to eat between 10 am and 7 p.m., the timing of feeding was well synchronized with the light–dark cycle and therefore may have positively impacted body metabolism.",cb84bdda-c13f-4c32-973a-0bd9429e6699
28,discussion6," Unfortunately, we haven’t directly assessed the genes linked to the circadian clock, and further study should be employed to confirm this hypothesis.  Aerobic performance and metabolism In elite cyclists, the relation between PPO and body weight is an important contributing factor to sport performance. Overall, the performance during the incremental and endurance test did not change from baseline; however, we observed a significant increase of PPO/BW in the time restricted eating (TRE) group as compared to the ND group. It is interesting to note that fat-free mass wasn’t compromised during the diet regimen, even though time restricted eating (TRE) induced a reduction of testosterone and IGF-1. We have previously observed a drop of anabolic hormones after time restricted eating (TRE) [21], probably due to a reduced leptin-mediated control on the hypothalamo-hypophysial-gonadal axis.",eefc90a9-5745-4ca6-9022-4b41f872f838
29,discussion7," It seems indeed that intermittent fasting regimen can exert an inhibitory effect on the Leydig cells responsible for the production of testosterone [37, 38]. Moreover, it is possible that time restricted eating (TRE), similarly to calorie restriction, stimulates the AMP-activated protein kinase/Acetyl-CoA-Carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling pathway [3]. AMPK is a central metabolic regulator activated during low cellular energy status, when trigged it stimulates ATP production via fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis, while simultaneously inhibits anabolic processes. Studies performed in rodents, showed that short-term fasting (19–39 h) increases AMPK and ACC activation in adipocytes, but not in muscle [39, 40]; however, this hypothesis hasn’t been confirmed in humans. Moreover, caloric restriction doesn’t seem to reduce IGF-1 concentration, although it may increase IGFBP-1 [41].",ac173815-7577-424e-aae3-83ee0a436031
30,discussion8," In the present study we did not analyze plasma leptin but considering the similarity between the time restricted eating (TRE) protocol and our prior study in resistance-trained men, we can speculate that the reduction of anabolic hormones could be due to an alteration of adiponectin/leptin levels.  Unlike our previous study [21] on resistance-trained athletes, we didn’t observe any significant alteration of T3 nor TSH levels or Resting energy expenditure (REE) in the time restricted eating (TRE) group. Interestingly, ferritin appeared to decrease in ND but not in time restricted eating (TRE), although this was not statistically significant. Ferritin not only reflects iron stores but is also used as an index of exercise tolerance [42, 43]. A drop of ferritin in endurance athletes can occur during the initial months of training [44], although time restricted eating (TRE) seems to blunt this effect.",6ca8d74c-bac9-44ed-b65d-6421e8c9e879
31,discussion9,"  Inflammatory markers and immune response Endurance elite athletes present lower leucocytes counts, neutrophils and monocytes plasma concentration compared to other sports, probably due to the inflammatory adaptive response to aerobic training [45]. These decreases in components of the immune system may contribute to the susceptibility to bacterial and upper respiratory infection [46, 47]. Exercise increases pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6, IL-1β; TNF-α), which mediate the communication between immune and non-immune cells in order to elicit repair processes. This activation is transient, with markers normally returning to basal level in 24–30 h [48], and is followed by the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines that have the function to reduce the inflammatory process [49, 50]. As a result, the immune response temporarily decreases, with total leucocytes and neutrophils increasing whilst lymphocytes decrease.",54696ad7-e4e2-4720-9f02-1e487fdf6619
32,discussion10," We already reported a modulation of some inflammatory markers after time restricted eating (TRE) (IL-6 and IL-1β and TNF-α) [21], whilst others did not observe any changes of these cytokines in healthy young men [51]. In the present study, IL-6 appeared to decrease in time restricted eating (TRE) and increase in ND (even if not significantly). Moreover, the ratio of neutrophils-to-lymphocytes (neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR)) is a biomarker of systemic inflammation largely used in clinical practice, which correlates with the circulating level of C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) [52, 53]. In our study, both groups presented a decrease in neutrophils and an increase in lymphocytes after 4 weeks of treatment, whilst the neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR) seems to be more affected by the time restricted eating (TRE) compare to ND (time restricted eating (TRE) -39%; ND − 30%).",6304934c-7551-4eeb-8341-624b6606746e
33,discussion11," Interestingly, while post-intervention leucocytes appeared lower than baseline in both groups, they were significantly reduced only in the ND group. It is known that short-term caloric restriction can compromise the immune system response [15, 54], however, the present experiment did not reduce the energy intake. This is the first time that time restricted eating (TRE) has been correlated to the immune response to exercise training, and it seems that time restricted eating (TRE) may possibly have a protective effect, attenuating the reduction in leucocytes count and thus potentially preventing the susceptibility to infections in young elite endurance athletes.  Some limitations of the present study should be taken into account. One is the reduced number of subjects involved, and secondly the usage of an interview methodology to determine energy and macronutrient composition. This approach has known weaknesses and may have played a role in the observed outcomes.",d10deb8e-22ab-44b6-9c94-b3c5aefca8ae
34,discussion12," Moreover, although the team dietitian supervised most of the meals consumed, we didn’t collect a food diary record during the intervention to compare with the baseline habits.  Conclusion Our results suggest that the 16/8 time restricted eating (TRE) protocol could be beneficial in elite endurance athletes to improve body composition and inflammatory markers without affecting aerobic performance. Moreover, time restricted eating (TRE) may help the function of the immune system, attenuating the decrease of leucocytes that typically occurs in high-trained individuals, although further investigation is warranted. This kind of dietary regimen could be adopted by endurance athletes to reduce body fat mass.",01dbbd80-07d1-49c3-b029-abdafb6cbf1f
35,discussion13," Our preliminary data may suggest that time restricted eating (TRE) could be a proper dietary regimen in particular during the pre-season training that normally occurs during the winter season, in which the training-induced depression of immune system increases the respiratory infection susceptibility.
