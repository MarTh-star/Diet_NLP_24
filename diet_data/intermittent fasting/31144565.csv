Participants Fifty-three sedentary males with obesity (age range: 20–30 years; body mass index, BMI: ≥30 kg/m2) were recruited from University students and staff as well as via social networks. Thirty-four participants (age = 24.2 ± 3.6 years) without chronic diseases or other health concerns consented to participate in this study. The inclusion criteria for this study were: A BMI of 30–40 kg/m2, no use of drugs or alcohol, lack of regular exercise for at least 6 months before this study, no history of renal, hepatic, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and no injuries or other physical disabilities [22]. The exclusion criteria were diabetes or evidence of clinical depression, cognitive disorders, heart disease, cancer, liver or renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease, uncontrolled hypertension, physical disability, or other contraindications. Women were also excluded from this study because of their menstrual cycles for which they are exempted from fasting during Ramadan.",2f212e23-47a4-4eba-aa02-47ad57ff0081
1,methods1," A physician evaluated all criteria using the physical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q) and medical health/history questionnaire. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee on Human Research of the University of Rennes 2, France, and the University of la Manouba, Tunisia (ethic code: Tn, UM2019-73), and was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  2.2. Study Design This study was conducted during Ramadan (from 5 May 2019 to 3 June 2019) in Tunisia and all the measurements (e.g., anthropometric measurements, questionnaires, blood sampling and analysis) were performed at the Laboratory of Biological Analysis, Principal Military Hospital (Tunis, Tunisia).  The fasting duration was 15–16 h per day and in an environment in which the mean temperature was 24 °C. Participants were randomly allocated to either an experimental group (EG, n = 15, 24.5 ± 3.",028f2001-81c6-43df-bd4b-6d1a9b0370a9

The EG completed their fasting rituals for the entire month of Ramadan (30 days), whereas the CG continued with their normal daily habits. Prior to any measurements, participants were fully familiarized with all procedures involved in this study. Anthropometric measurements and blood samples were collected at four time points: 24 h before the start of Ramadan (T0), on the 15th day of Ramadan (T1), the day after the end of Ramadan (T2) and 21 days after the end of Ramadan (T3) (Figure 2). All measurements were obtained at the same time of day (within ~1 h).   2.3.",1c773614-3431-4b0b-9316-853277a1fc0a
3,methods3," Physical Activity Level Physical activity levels of the participants were classified according to the American College of Sports Medicine Guidelines [23] using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) [24]. Physically inactive subjects included those who performed less than 150 min per week of moderate-intensity physical activity and less than 75 min per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity during the last three months, while the physically active subjects met at least one of these criteria [23]. Participants in our study were categorized as being physically inactive.  2.4. Dietary Habits Control All participants were asked to record their normal nutritional habits during the experiment. Participants were asked to complete a two-day 24 h dietary recall, one on a weekday and the other on a weekend day, prior to each blood sampling.",22cdc476-10ff-4cb2-b5f6-9c8ec23fd1b4
4,methods4," For this, participants were asked to recall the foods consumed over the previous 24 h. A 24 h period was defined as the time between when the participants woke up the previous day until the time they woke up the day of the interview [25]. A dietitian informed participants about the recall procedure at the beginning of each interview [25]. The validity and reliability of this method have been previously described [26,27,28]. The number of nutrients consumed was calculated using the method described previously [29]. Subjects in the CG were instructed not to alter their daily dietary habits. Table 1 indicates the nutrients consumed by participants during the study.  2.5. Anthropometric Measurements Body weights were measured on a digital scale (Medtrue Enterprise Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China) with a precision of 0.1 kg. The height of the participants was measured with a stadiometer (Med. Electronics, Beltsville, MD, USA) with a precision of 0.1 cm. BMI was calculated and recorded as kg/m2.",d0bc6b76-c673-44ac-9588-40c2178a02a1
5,methods5," Waist circumference was measured using a retractable measuring tape (The perfect measuring company, Toledo, OH, USA) at the superior edge of the iliac crest and around the widest part of the hips; these measurements were used to calculate the waist-to-hip ratio (waist to hip ratio (WHR)) of each participant. Body fat percentage (Body fat percentage (BFP)) was measured with a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance device (Inbody 720, Seoul, South Korea) [30], which had been validated in other studies [31]. However, this method is not as accurate as dual x-ray absorptiometry, which is considered the gold standard for body composition assessment [32]. Fat-free mass (Fat free mass (FFM)) was calculated by subtracting the fat mass from the body mass.   2.6.",b296980a-9b0b-487f-9af1-566249a3fa52
6,methods6," Blood Sampling and Analysis Participants were instructed to comply with the following conditions before each blood sampling: (1) avoid the use of medications and supplements, (2) avoid any strenuous physical activity for at least 72 h before the blood withdrawal, (3) maintain the same diet for 48 h prior to each blood withdrawal, (4) eat the last meal prior to blood sampling before midnight. Blood was collected from the antecubital vein in the morning between 8 and 9 a.m. after an overnight fast. Samples were collected in two pre-cooled 4.9 mL EDTA vacuettes (Klap activator model, Fisher Scientific Inc., Illkirch, France), and whole blood samples were analyzed for a complete blood count using an automated cell counter (Nexcelom Bioscience LLC., Lawrence, KS, USA). Hematocrit (Ht) and hemoglobin concentrations ([Hb]) were then determined.",3c0fa105-cb27-4da6-a0c4-cc8401acc563
7,methods7," Plasma volume variations (ΔPV) were calculated according to the formula proposed by Dill and Costill (1974):  ΔPV (%) = 100 × [([Hb]a/[Hb]b) × [(1 − Htb)/(1 − Hta)] − 100](1)  ‘a’ and ‘b’ refer to fasting state values for Ht and [Hb] before and after fasting, respectively.  One EDTA vacuette was immediately centrifuged at 1500× g for 10 min at 4 °C (Heraeus Multifuge X3R, Thermo Scientific, Loughborough, UK). The plasma supernatant was then dispensed into separate 2 mL cryovials and stored at −80 °C until later analysis of total peptide YY (PYY), total GLP-1, CCK and leptin concentrations. From each sample, duplicate 20 μL blood samples were collected into heparinized microhematocrit tubes for determination of hematocrit and a 10 μL sample into a microcuvette for determination of hemoglobin concentrations to enable an estimation of plasma volume changes.",4e70f5d6-d122-400e-97c1-d81964c6f960
8,methods8," To prevent the degradation of acylated ghrelin, a 50 μL solution containing potassium phosphate buffer, p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, and sodium hydroxide was added to one 4.9 mL EDTA vacuette, which was then centrifuged at 1500× g for 10 min at 4 °C [33]. The plasma supernatant was then dispensed into a storage tube and 100 μL of 1 M hydrochloric acid was added per ml of plasma to preserve acylated ghrelin [34].   Commercially available enzyme immunoassays were used to determine plasma concentrations of acylated ghrelin, CCK and leptin concentrations (SPI BIO, Montigny le Bretonneux, France) and total GLP-1, total peptide YY (PYY) (Millipore, Watford, UK), and total GLP-1 (Millipore, Watford, UK). To eliminate interassay variation, samples from each participant were analyzed in the same assay batch. The within batch coefficients of variation for the assays were as follows: Acylated ghrelin, 4.3%; total peptide YY (PYY), 5.1%; GLP-1, 4.2%; leptin, 2.9%; and CCK, 1.8%.  2.7.",01d15b21-5d05-48c7-b6af-a66f1e7d593a
9,methods9," Statistical Analysis A priori power analysis (desired power = 0.80, and alpha error = 0.05) was computed to estimate a statistically significant group by a time-interaction effect based on previous research. The analysis revealed a sample size of n = 10.76 per group. To account for potential dropouts, 17 participants were included in each of the two study groups.   Data are presented as means ± standard deviations (M ± SD). After normality of data distribution was confirmed using the Shapiro–Wilk test, differences within and between groups were calculated using a two-way analysis of variance (a two way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) for repeated measures. If the group x time interactions were significant, a Newman–Keul’s post-hoc test was calculated. Relationships between parameters were assessed using Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (r).",97452d6e-9c40-4e3d-bd22-2338544b9f52
10,methods10," Additionally, effect sizes (ES) were determined from a two way analysis of variance (ANOVA) output by converting partial eta-squared to Cohen’s d. Moreover, within-group ES were computed using the following equation: ES = (mean post−mean pre)/SD [35]. In accordance with Hopkins and colleagues’ study, ES were considered trivial (<0.2), small (0.2–0.6), moderate (0.6–1.2), large (1.2–2.0) and very large (2.0–4.0) [36]. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were computed using SPSS for Windows, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  3. Results Four participants (two participants per group) were removed from this study due to non-compliance. The remaining participants reported a 100% adherence to study procedures and conditions. Hence, data are presented herein for the 15 participants per experimental group. No significant between-group differences were noted for any anthropometric and hormone measurements at baseline (T0).",996ea6b5-60da-4618-a67b-14be906dde54
11,methods11," Macronutrient values and total energy intake of the EG and CG groups were recorded at T0, T1, T2, and T3 and are described in Table 1. There were no significant differences in macronutrient values and total energy intake between the two groups at each measurement time.  3.1. Time-Related Effects All anthropometric characteristics (Table 2) displayed significant time-related effects (post-test > pre-test). ES magnitudes ranged from small to moderate for all measurements. Significant effects of time were observed for body mass (p = 0.007; d = 0.484), BMI (p = 0.003; d = 0.479), Body fat percentage (BFP) (p = 0.005; d = 0.653), Fat free mass (FFM) (p = 0.002; d = 0.690) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) (p = 0.001; d = 0.785). No significant change (p > 0.05) of ΔPV was recorded after Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) for both EG (−0.03 ± 0.01%) and CG (0.06 ± 0.07%).",fed2b492-55b1-4a54-b5dc-8ab76ee088c8

Discussion Our principal finding is that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) has a beneficial effect on gut hormone levels (leptin, GLP-1, peptide YY (PYY), and CCK) as well as body composition characteristics in obese sedentary men. Our findings suggest that IF could be used as part of an integrated program for combatting obesity in men.  The significant reduction in body mass after Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) is likely due to the reductions in Body fat percentage (BFP) and/or in lean body mass including body water [37]. The loss of body mass we observed can be explained by the reduction in Body fat percentage (BFP) since we recorded a significant reduction in Body fat percentage (BFP) without any significant changes in Fat free mass (FFM) or PV.",c8c128f4-01a1-487c-8a48-dd083bfd9789
13,methods15," The reduction in body weight and visceral adiposity after Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) could be attributed to the metabolic transfer to ketogenesis and the oxidation of fatty acids as an alternate source of energy after the depletion of carbohydrate reserves in the body in response to the prolonged fasting [38,39,40,41]. Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) can also increase liver glycogen mobilization, increase gluconeogenesis, and ultimately increase free fatty acids (FFAs), and in turn, lead to decreases in Body fat percentage (BFP) [42]. Other studies have attributed this decrease to significant dehydration in individuals with obesity during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF), since such individuals may have more body water due to larger total glycogen stores [43,44]. Thus, Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) also appears to increase resting metabolic rate (resting metabolic rate (RMR)), which could lead to a possible decrease in Body fat percentage (BFP) [45].",07eb3f8d-023d-4148-9949-297e2a989d4a
14,methods16," These changes in body weight and Body fat percentage (BFP) could consequently result in the BMI and waist to hip ratio (WHR) changes observed following Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF).  Improvements in gut hormone concentration were observed after Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF). Our findings are in agreement with those of Çaklili et al. who also reported that leptin concentrations increased following Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF), suggesting a role for leptin to satiety in Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) [46]. In contrast, leptin concentrations were decreased after 8 weeks of alternate-day fasting during weight loss in obese participants, which was interpreted as the brain becoming less sensitive to meal-generated satiety signals, leading to decreased leptin concentrations [45]. Consequently, more calories would need to be consumed before a sufficient signal is generated to inhibit food intake.",09c3afb5-47d2-4ae3-bd83-760280cd727b
15,methods17," Accordingly, decreases in leptin concentrations following weight loss could have consequences of increased appetite, calorie intake, and weight regain.   Leptin concentrations are thought to reflect the state of nutrition and energy reserve [47], but there is also a diurnal rhythm of leptin secretion linked to meal patterns. Hence, the shifting mealtime during Ramadan could cause a comparable shift in the rhythm of leptin secretion. Thus, lunchtime is moved forward by ~8 h per day during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF), which can likely alter the circadian pattern of leptin responses [48].   We found that plasma ghrelin concentrations were not significantly increased by Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF), confirming observations by others that ghrelin concentrations were not significantly changed following Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) in obese females [19]. Ghrelin concentrations are primarily regulated by food intake.",cea2bbdb-e942-439f-90cf-756fad6fe506
16,methods18," Hence, ghrelin levels increase during fasting (in line with increased hunger) and are generally lower in individuals with higher body weights compared with lean individuals, suggesting a role for ghrelin in the regulation of body weight [49].   We report that GLP-1 concentrations decreased after Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF). Contrary to our results, other studies suggested insignificant changes in GLP-1 concentrations after Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) in females and males, suggesting that the hypothalamus most likely adapts to hunger-related to intentional fasting during Ramadan [19,46]. Furthermore, a non-significant decrease in GLP-1 occurs after Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) in obese females [19]. GLP-1 stimulates insulin release from the pancreas, increases pancreatic beta cell volume, and mitigates glucagon release.",bb054ae7-153a-49af-911d-ccd6bd9524d8
17,methods19," GLP-1 also increases the feeling of fullness during and between meals by acting on appetite centers in the brain and by slowing the emptying of the stomach [50]. We showed that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) negatively affects GLP-1. It has been proposed that even a small increase in GLP-1 release after a meal can increase the risk of obesity [50]. We speculate that the positive correlation between GLP-1 levels and Body fat percentage (BFP) we observed may likely be due to a decreased appetite following Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF).   peptide YY (PYY) is secreted into the blood by cells of the ileum and the colon following stimulation by nutrients from ingested food [50]. Our study shows that peptide YY (PYY) concentrations decreased significantly following Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF). peptide YY (PYY) is released after food intake and works by binding to receptors in the brain, which in turn decreases appetite and creates a sense of fullness after eating.",9cfd7e72-99c0-43cf-8f16-818274c9d33c
18,methods20," The amount of peptide YY (PYY) released into the blood depends on the number of calories eaten, with higher calorie content foods causing a greater release of peptide YY (PYY). Thus, decreasing food intake during the day with Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) could lower peptide YY (PYY) concentrations. The secretion of peptide YY (PYY) can also be stimulated by digestive juices (such as bile) and the gastrointestinal hormone CCK, which may be involved in appetite regulation by increasing the sensation of fullness in the short term, such as during a meal rather than between meals. We showed that CCK concentrations decreased significantly following Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF), suggesting that not consuming food throughout the day during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) affects these key hormones that are responsible for food intake and appetite control.",d4825595-bc4f-49c3-a47f-4571af00d10a
19,methods21,"   Study Limitations Both GLP-1 and peptide YY (PYY) are released post-prandially, with plasma levels peaking 15–20 min after a meal [20]. As only fasting levels of these hormones were measured, our study may have failed to measure the impact of peak levels in the EG. Similarly, ghrelin is suppressed by feeding and an augmented suppression may have been missed in the EG due to our assessment protocol. Furthermore, we evaluated obese male participants and hence cannot generalize our findings to other populations.   Body fat percentage (BFP) was measured using bioelectrical impedance, a commonly used technique, which determines Body fat percentage (BFP) based on methods developed in normal-weight subjects but this procedure can underestimate Body fat percentage (BFP) in the obese participants in our study [51,52]. Bioelectrical impedance measures conductance, which can be affected by fluid restriction [53].",a2d5bba2-ab24-475e-a07d-d41f698a091f
20,methods22," Therefore, the use of this method could have masked an even greater decrease in Body fat percentage (BFP) change in the EG.  Since we did not collect data beyond 21 days after the end of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF), it may be premature to conclude that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) is a suitable strategy for the long-term management of obesity. Nonetheless, our findings support fasting as a behavioral practice that has some degree of utility in the management of obesity. Future research needs to pursue this line of reasoning to determine practicality of the procedure in such applications.  5. Conclusions Obesity is accompanied by increases in adiposity and changes in appetite-regulating hormones. Altering the abnormal release of these hormones may be useful in managing obesity.",9ed14162-5aa8-4bac-a9e3-cbdc3e89b265
21,methods23," Ramadan IF improved body composition indices (Body fat percentage (BFP), waist to hip ratio (WHR), and BMI) in healthy obese males and produced changes in plasma levels of leptin (increased), GLP-1 (decreased), peptide YY (PYY) (decreased) and CCK (decreased), with no changes in plasma ghrelin levels. Changes in hormone levels persisted for 3 weeks after the end of Ramadan. Our findings suggest that IF could be used as part of an integrated program for combatting obesity in men.
