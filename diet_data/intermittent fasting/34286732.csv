FIGURE 9 Safety profile for the treatments [WS root (WSR) extract (100 mg/kg/d), cisplatin (5 mg/kg/week), IF, their combinations].",05f97946-81d6-44ec-a758-dfb48fe77608

In the case of serum creatinine, normal levels of creatinine were observed between tumor nonbearing mice and the other mice groups, which were treated with the above-mentioned treatments. However, the single treatment of cisplatin increased creatinine levels significantly (1.2 mg/dl with a p value of 0.001). Note that combined treatment of cisplatin with either WS root (WSR) extract or WS root (WSR) extract and IF showed lower creatinine levels than cisplatin alone, with values of 0.81 and 0.79 mg/dl, respectively (Figure 9C).

28,discussion0," Diverse obstacles hinder the successful treatment of breast cancer due to toxicity to normal cells, the narrow therapeutic index of chemotherapy, and multidrug resistance (MDR). The latter is a major obstacle because multidrug resistance (MDR) has accounted for the failure of treatments and subsequently death (26). The combination of chemotherapy with natural products is widely used these days to overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) (27). As another option, IF can reduce tumor incidence, potentiate the effectiveness of chemotherapy, and improve the response to chemotherapy (28). In this research, water extract of WS root (WSR) and IF was examined compared with cisplatin in vitro using EMT6/P and EMT6/CPR breast cancer cell lines and in vivo using female Balb/C mice inoculated with EMT6/P and EMT6/CPR breast cancer cell lines. In vitro and in vivo tests showed promising results.",e081d2f3-64af-4107-a135-f802d32b7c23
29,discussion1," It is worth mentioning that the WS root (WSR) extract, IF combination, and triple combination have not been tested before.  In vitro, our results based on the viability assay indicated that WS root (WSR) extract prevented EMT6/P and EMT6/CPR cell line viability in a concentration-dependent pattern. The present results agree with previous studies. Prasad et al. (29) observed a dose-dependent anti-breast cancer activity for the crude water extract of WS root (WSR) on MCF-7 cell lines (29). This antiproliferative effect of the WS root (WSR) extract is related to its content of anticancer components (Table 1). Based on the previous finding, succinic acid (68.52%) revealed an apoptotic effect on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL cell line) and increased caspase-3 activity in human leukemic lymphoblasts (CCRF-CEM cell line) in vitro (30). Additionally, anthranilic acid (16.87%) has been widely used with its derivatives to fight cancer and it has an antiproliferative effect (31).",f3fe3e10-e5bb-41e9-91d7-d434a5f222ea
30,discussion2," Furthermore, the phenolic compounds, gallic acid (7.52%) can reduce viability and promote apoptosis (32) by upregulation of Fas and FasL and induction of p53 and caspase-3 (33). The latter is considered a key enzyme in the execution of apoptosis (5). Considering that WS root (WSR) extract caused a dramatic increase in caspase-3 levels in both EMT6/P and EMT6/CPR cell lines, and that potentiates the apoptotic effect and reduce viability (Figures 5A,B). These outcomes were matched with a previous study where the caspase-3 activity was enhanced upon the use of WS root (WSR) extract on MDA-MB231 (34).  Cisplatin was used as a positive control, along with the WS root (WSR) extract. WS root (WSR) extract with cisplatin showed a moderate synergism in both cell lines and reduced the used dose of cisplatin influentially, in addition to their ability to reduce the resistance fold of cisplatin (Table 2).",9da1e601-066c-4432-86e2-1f05aac5030f
31,discussion3," Thus, it was concluded that WS root (WSR) extract alongside cisplatin resulted in greater synergism than any other combination tested alone. Consistent with previous studies, withaferin A synergized the effect of paclitaxel on both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant NSCLC cells in vitro (35). Also, the antiapoptotic effect of this combination enhanced the level of caspase-3 effectively compared with the control, WS root (WSR) extract-treated cells, and cisplatin-treated cells in both cell lines. As noted, WS root (WSR) extracts remarkably potentiated the cisplatin response in the resistant cell line (Figures 5A,B), which means that WS root (WSR) extract sensitized the resistant cell line to cisplatin at lower doses. Previously, Cohen et al. (36) showed that withaferin A along with sorafenib raised caspase-3 levels efficiently in papillary and anaplastic cancers (36).  Different treatments were tested in vitro in this research.",9636a833-4850-433b-be91-5c010ba0e4f7
32,discussion4," In agreement with in vitro data, WS root (WSR) extract reduced tumor size in EMT6/P and EMT6/CPR in vivo to 51.97 and 40.49%, respectively (Table 3). These findings follow previous studies where water extract of WS reduced tumor size in mice bearing cervical (HeLa) and colorectal (HT-29) cell-derived tumors (37). Another previous study observed that withaferin A, a component in WS root (WSR), showed tumor size reduction in mice injected with HeLa cells (38).  Another side of interest in this context is IF, which showed in vivo antitumor effect by reducing the tumor size in both EMT6/P and EMT6/CPR tumor-bearing mice by 52.75 and 37.22%, respectively (Table 3). It has been reported that IF reduced tumor size in a colon cancer xenograft mice model (CT26 cells) (39). Depending on that, the proposed antitumor effect of IF is due to reversing the Warburg effect and increasing BHB. Both have approved antitumor activity as mentioned before.",af3d78b1-383f-4593-b600-df411e73a076
33,discussion5," Moreover, serum glucose level is an indicator for the Warburg effect (16), which was tested in this study. Based on the obtained results, cancer-induced mice that were treated with IF displayed a considerable serum glucose reduction compared with the control group (Figure 8A), which means that the Warburg effect was reversed and this was also proved before (40). The same groups had a higher level of BHB, which is considered an anticancer molecule (41) (Figure 8B).  Different combinations were explored in vivo in this research. First, combination treatment of WS root (WSR) extract and cisplatin showed more size reduction of tumor (81.12 and 69.49% in mice bearing EMT6/P and EMT6/CPR cell lines, respectively; Table 3). These observations provided the basis that cisplatin and its combination with WS root (WSR) extract resulted in greater efficacy and potency than the use of the drug alone in both cell lines.",8064e6ee-dfae-4d54-88d2-c856bd75a91f
34,discussion6," Interestingly, WS root (WSR) extract sensitized the resistant cell line to cisplatin, remarkably.  Alternatively, a combination treatment of WS root (WSR) extract and IF resulted in more tumor size reduction (60.52%) compared with a single treatment of WS root (WSR) extract (51.97%) and IF (52.75%) in EMT6/P cells. Furthermore, combination treatment of WS root (WSR) extract and IF resulted in more tumor size reduction (53.36%) compared with single treatment WS root (WSR) extract (40.49%) and IF (37.22%) in EMT6/CPR cells. This combination has not been tested before; however, IF showed a synergistic effect with ascorbic acid vs. Kirsten rat sarcoma virus, a gene that makes a protein that is involved in cell signaling pathways that control cell growth, cell maturation, and cell death (KRAS) mutated cancers (42). Others observed that the combination of WS and Maitake (Grifola frondosa) extract had a synergistic effect on immunity (43).",68df9bb5-5a22-496c-8102-720d6ee6cdcf
35,discussion7," Moreover, WS root (WSR) extract induced oxidative stress, which could potentiate the effect of IF by reversing the Warburg effect (44). WS root (WSR) extract countered the effect of IF on mice’s weight significantly (Figure 7).  The mechanistic analysis provided in the literature demonstrates that WS can sensitize cancerous cells to chemotherapy through the apoptotic pathway, which is considered a predominant pathway for cisplatin-induced cell death. WS activates tumor suppressor p53, a fundamental element for inducting cisplatin-induced apoptosis and overcoming resistance (45). Primarily, A can block the autophagy flux in breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, which is considered another method to reverse chemoresistance (46).  It was imperative to examine the last combination, which included IF, WS root (WSR) extract, and cisplatin.",262fbe48-2599-4abf-a17f-5b521b8f9e0b
36,discussion8," Further reduction in tumor size was detected by adding IF to the extract and cisplatin leading to complete vanishment of the tumor in the sensitive and resistant cell lines. That supported the synergistic effect of IF in both cell lines. Moreover, IF succeeded to sensitize the resistant cell lines to cisplatin and that was confirmed by the complete reduction of the tumor. Interestingly, this combination has not been evaluated in the literature (Figure 6; Table 3). Nevertheless, IF can reverse multidrug resistance (MDR) by several pathways as revealed in the literature. The first way is by increasing p53, which is substantial for sensitization (47). By the same token, IF suppresses IGF-1 and IGF-1 receptors and that increases sensitivity to chemotherapy (48).",4401d044-1409-4dd7-ba24-ec18e879d256
37,discussion9," Figure 10 illustrates the proposed mechanisms for WS root (WSR) extract and IF combination and how they can evade cancer and can sensitize resistant cells to cisplatin, when added, based on the results obtained from this study and former studies.  FIGURE 10 The proposed mechanisms for WS root (WSR) extract and IF combination and how they can evade cancer and sensitize resistant cells to cisplatin, when added, based on the results obtained from this study and former studies. SA, succinic acid; GA, gallic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.  The safety profile of anticancer agents is crucial to evaluating their toxicity. Liver enzymes (aminotransferase (ALT) and aminotransferase (AST)) and creatinine were used as indicators of liver and kidney functions, respectively. Results demonstrated that all treated groups had a normal level of aminotransferase (ALT), except the cisplatin-treated group. As mentioned previously, cisplatin can induce hepatotoxicity.",5281de08-b21f-4e0a-ab6e-59b78ebc6764
38,discussion10," Combination treatments showed lower aminotransferase (ALT) levels than single treatment with cisplatin (Figure 9A). On top of that, aminotransferase (AST) levels were normal in the treated groups without exception. Nevertheless, combination treatments revealed lower aminotransferase (AST) levels than cisplatin alone (Figure 9B). In the literature, the extract of WS root (WSR) showed hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects on radiation-induced hepatotoxicity (49). In contrast, creatine levels were normal in the treatment groups, excluding the cisplatin-treated group. The explanation for this finding is that cisplatin induces nephrotoxicity, which is one of the most serious obstacles that hinder cisplatin use (50). Despite that, combination treatment relieved the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin (Figure 9C). Formerly, water extract caused a remarkable elevation in the antioxidant activities of glutathione and superoxide dismutase to conserve renal tissue damage from gentamicin (51).",a62277a3-5e40-4003-8e92-c84041ad82eb
39,discussion11,"  Conclusion  Based on the data presented here, we concluded that the combination of WS root (WSR) extract and cisplatin has a synergistic anticancer effect on both the parent and the resistant cell lines in vitro and in vivo, better than cisplatin alone through apoptosis induction and caspase-3 activation. On the other hand, the combination of IF with WS root (WSR) extract has a superior ability to cause a reduction in tumor size. The activity of this combination was enhanced in the presence of cisplatin and caused complete tumor regression. These combinations are safer for the liver and kidney than the conventional therapy cisplatin. Such novel findings are worth the opportunity of expanding the range of research to establish better treatment for breast cancer in the future. Further studies are needed to evaluate the expression levels of antiapoptotic genes including Bcl2, BAX, and caspase 8 and to study morphological changes in cells after treatment.",923bc932-06ba-49e3-aa67-773fdcb7bc99
