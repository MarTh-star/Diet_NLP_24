0,methods0," Detailed intervention methods have been previously described [21]. Briefly, 34 generally healthy (17 men and 17 women), recreationally active but untrained individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 22.0–35.0 kg/m2 aged between 18 and 35 years were randomised to undertake 12 weeks of resistance training (3 sessions per week; two 45-minute supervised session and one 30-minute unsupervised session) and either a continuous energy restriction (continuous energy restriction (CER)T group) or 5:2 intermittent fasting (IFT group) diet. The aim of both diet prescriptions was to provide an average 20% energy restriction and ≥1.4 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. Those in the IFT group were asked to fast on non-consecutive, non-training days each week. Fasting days involved consumption of high-protein shakes and soups, as well as non-starchy vegetables, in order to maintain moderate protein intake while providing ~20% of energy requirements.",4ff50831-3170-4a12-ade2-7113438f03a8
1,methods1," Participants aimed for 100% energy requirements on the remaining 5 days. Those in the continuous energy restriction (CER)T group aimed to consume 80% of energy requirements daily for the entirety of the intervention. In order to assess dietary intake, participants were asked to complete a 3-day food diary using a mobile phone application during weeks 1, 6 and 12. Results of are reported in the primary outcomes study for this intervention [21]. The original study was powered to detect differences in the primary outcome (lean body mass). This study was retrospectively registered with ACTRN: ACTRN12620000920998, September 2020.  2.1. Cardiometabolic Health Blood Markers  Fasted blood samples were taken from each participant prior to and after the completion of the 12-week intervention in order to assess the impact of each intervention on blood markers of cardiometabolic health. Samples were taken between 7.00 a.m. and 11.00 a.m.",bb9d26e5-e29e-4e9f-880a-64344f2a5189
2,methods2," after a minimum 8 h fast (although participants were encouraged to consume water on the night before and the morning of testing). Approximately 20 mL of blood was drawn into a serum-separating tube from a vein in the antecubital region. The tube was left to sit for at least 20 min but less than 40 min to allow for clotting. The samples were then centrifuged for 12 min at 3000 RPM to separate the serum. Serum was then aliquoted and stored at −84 degrees Celsius before being packed in dry ice and sent via courier to an external lab for analysis (Melbourne Pathology, Victoria, Australia). Serum samples were analysed for total serum cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; calculated via Friedewald’s formula), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, blood glucose, insulin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using the equation ([blood glucose x insulin]/22.",0722ecdc-1343-4a47-9504-813fc7b1d544

Self-Reported Dietary Compliance, Mood, Hunger and Satiety Levels and Post-Intervention Intentions  For each day of the 12-week intervention, participants were asked to complete an online survey. Participants were asked to complete the survey just prior to going to bed each day, consistent with previous research [23]. In order to promote completion of the survey, participants were sent as many as 5 text message reminders per week. Each participant received a unique survey link that included a total of 17 questions to assess levels of hunger, satiety, energy, mood and compliance. These questions were adapted from previously validated visual analogue scales [24,25] into 0-to-10-point Likert scales in order to facilitate use on a mobile phone. In the survey, 4 questions pertained to hunger, 4 to cravings, 4 to energy levels and 4 to mood.",d1a4fe51-0e66-4b32-9e43-0349aab9ef17
4,methods4," Additionally, there was a final question asking participants to rate, on a scale of 0 to 10, how compliant they felt they were with their diet that day, based on meeting their predefined energy and protein requirements. For analysis, these questions were combined into 5 distinct measures; hunger, cravings, energy levels, mood and compliance, which are shown in Table 1.  Scoring of each measure was undertaken by combining the responses (0–10) from the Likert scale for each of the 4 questions. For ease of interpretation, when higher scores indicated a negative response for a question category (e.g., How sleepy do you feel? for the energy levels category), values were transformed into positive scores by subtracting the recorded Likert scale score from 10. Thus, all scores were presented as positive values, and each survey category had a maximum score of 40, except for compliance (maximum score of 10).",8910e4a8-1ffe-4c75-8f9f-4d247ad33f54
5,methods5," Additionally, because the original cravings questions were validated in such a way that higher scores indicated lower cravings, all questions for this section were also transformed (as per Table 1) when presenting results to ensure easier interpretation. Thus, higher scores on the cravings scale presented in the data represent higher levels of cravings.  Finally, at the end of the intervention, participants were asked to rate how easy they found the diet to comply with on a scale of 0 to 10, whether they thought they would continue with the diet after the intervention had finished and whether or not they would have preferred to be in the alternate intervention group. In an open-ended question, participants were also asked to explain what they felt was the most difficult part of the intervention.  2.3. Statistics  2.3.1.

Assumptions of normality were violated for hsCRP, triglycerides, insulin and HOMA-IR. Insulin and HOMA-IR were log10-transformed to achieve normality; however, normality could not be achieved for hsCRP and triglycerides. Three outlying hsCRP values (>10.0 mg/L) were removed, as these were likely to be due to acute illness. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to analyse differences in non-normal variables from baseline to post intervention. For normally distributed variables, linear mixed models were used to test for main effects of time, group and sex, as well as all 2- and 3-way interactions. As there was a significant difference between groups for baseline TC and a trend toward a difference in LDL-C, baseline values were centred and included as covariates in the model when analysing effects of the intervention on TC and LDL-C.",5d94c528-72ed-4293-a99e-505e8687f0e3

Furthermore, the same method was used to analyse differences on fasting and non-fasting (fed) days for the IFT group, with the effect of group replaced by condition (fasted or fed). Subsequently, pairwise comparisons using Sidak’s adjustment for multiple comparisons were utilised to determine in which weeks mean values were significantly different when a main effect of time was noted. All model assumptions for linear mixed modelling were verified for all analyses. The means for weeks 1, 6 and 12 are presented, as well as continuous weekly data, which are presented graphically using mean values and 95% confidence intervals.

9,methods9," Correlations between survey responses for each group were calculated by Spearman’s rank order correlation due to the non-normal nature of the survey data. Post-intervention questionnaire responses were analysed using descriptive analysis of responses or, for the question regarding ease of compliance, using a Mann–Whitney U test due to non-normality of the data. Similarly, compliance with the exercise routine was analysed using the Mann–Whitney U test. All analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

16,methods16," Additionally, whereas 14 participants in the IFT group and 15 in the continuous energy restriction (CER)T group indicated that they would continue with their diet after the intervention period, only 3 indicated that they would keep their diet the same as it had been prescribed. Common modifications that participants intended to make to their diets were lowering protein intake (n = 4) or, in the IFT group specifically, reducing the number of fasting days (n = 5) or changing intake to solid food or no intake at all on fasting days (n = 5). The most common difficulty noted by participants was complying with their diet during social encounters (IFT = 13, continuous energy restriction (CER)T = 14).  4. Discussion  The main findings from this secondary outcomes analysis were that both energy-restricted diets significantly reduced TC and LDL-C levels over the 12-week intervention period.",925757c7-ca01-4a8d-91d8-2fbb7095ecbe
17,methods17," These reductions were significantly greater in the IFT group compared to the continuous energy restriction (CER)T group, even after adjustment for baseline values and weight loss. HDL-C was also significantly decreased, albeit only in females. There were no significant differences in triglycerides, hsCRP or measures of insulin resistance over time or between interventions. Both groups reported high levels of dietary compliance and low levels of hunger. Finally, the majority of participants displayed an intention to continue with their respective diets, albeit generally in modified forms, emphasising that flexibility may be required when considering the long-term feasibility of different energy-restricted diets.  4.1. Cardiometabolic Biomarkers  The cohort of participants enrolled in the present study was, on average, overweight but metabolically healthy according to their baseline body mass index (BMI) and cardiometabolic blood markers, respectively.",505b5ba4-1340-4c10-b62f-2fb927e0ae7b
18,methods18," Over the 12-week intervention period, individuals undertaking IF displayed significantly greater reductions in TC and LDL-C compared to those undertaking continuous energy restriction (CER). These results are somewhat in contrast to results of a recent systematic review and meta-analysis that found continuous energy restriction (CER) to be more effective at reducing TC compared to IF, although comparable effects on LDL-C levels were noted between diets [26]. In the present analysis, there was a significant time x group x sex interaction for TC and a trend toward significance for LDL-C, indicating that differences in TC and LDL-C levels between the IFT and continuous energy restriction (CER)T groups were likely driven by a varying response to the intervention, depending on sex. There was a notable lack of change in females undertaking continuous energy restriction (CER) (TC: 0.0% and LDL-C: +2.",18a03653-0c0d-4674-9c1b-a0eb9e5724d3
19,methods19,"5%), whereas all other intervention/sex combinations demonstrated reductions in the order of ~10% to 20% in these markers. Although it is known that the amount of weight loss [27] and baseline values of TC and LDL-C [26] can influence changes in these markers during lifestyle interventions, this interaction remained significant after adjusting for both. It is not readily apparent why women in the IFT group experienced greater changes compared to those in the continuous energy restriction (CER)T group. Some previous studies in animal models have demonstrated sex-specific changes in response to calorie restriction [28,29], and it is possible that hormonal, divergent nutrient-sensing pathway activation in response to energy restriction and other mechanisms may be at play [30].",cc23a87b-ae83-498e-a46a-071ef9ecaea6
20,methods20," Nonetheless, in humans, research comparing continuous energy restriction (CER) and IF in females specifically have shown no differences in changes to TC or LDL-C (albeit utilizing endurance rather than resistance training) [31,32]. Given the limited number of studies in females within this area and the limited sample size in our study, more research is clearly needed to clarify potential sex differences.  Markers of glucose regulation were not significantly impacted over the 12-week period, regardless of dietary intervention and exercise training. However, male participants in both dietary groups demonstrated an average reduction in HOMA-IR of approximately 14–16%. Similarly, females also demonstrated an average reduction in HOMA-IR of ~22% but only within the continuous energy restriction (CER)T group. This is in contrast to the observations in TC and LDL-C levels discussed above, where changes were observed in females in the IFT group only.",7cd56527-a2b9-44a2-ad55-7ff7517ad037
21,methods21," The absence of improvement in HOMA-IR among females undertaking IF was likely driven by a lack of change in insulin levels (+2%), whereas all other groups demonstrated reductions of between 14–26%, on average. Whereas this potentially points to sex-specific responses, as discussed previously, the findings are congruent with some previous human research demonstrating increases in fasting insulin in overweight females following a period of IF [33]. Hutchison and colleagues [33] observed increased fasting insulin levels when measured after a fed day (although decreased levels after a fasted day) following 8 weeks of alternate-day fasting in individuals who were prescribed a protocol designed to maintain weight. The participants in the Hutchison study, who were, on average, much older than the participants in the current analysis (~50 vs. ~24 years old) did show similar modest weight loss compared to the IFT women in our group (~2.",6b157ba9-d0e5-4e50-9c3f-647ecb94fd22
22,methods22,"7 kg; see previously published findings [21]), and this could explain the lack of beneficial effects on glucose regulation. Hutchison et al. [33] included another energy-restricted alternative day fasting intervention group that experienced greater amounts of weight loss (5.4 kg), who experienced significant reductions in fasting insulin when measured after both a fed and fasted day. Differences between these groups in terms of insulin levels were only significant when tested after a fed day. As our participants were only tested after a fed day, we cannot determine whether a reduction in insulin would have been observed if tested after a fasted day. Nonetheless, this raises the possibility that meaningful amounts of weight loss may be required for IF to confer consistently beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis. It is important to note that the length (i.e., consecutive fasting days) [11] or timing of fasts (i.e.",bd06c874-ad02-4dbd-a051-0db24e9f32dd
23,methods23,", early time-restricted feeding) [10,34] may be a determining factor with respect to whether or not IF provides additional benefits for glucose homeostasis. When utilizing a 5:2 IF regime that involved consecutive fasting days, Harvie et al. [31] showed a benefit over that of continuous energy restriction (CER) for HOMA-IR, despite similar weight loss between groups. Thus, it is possible that the protocol in the present study did not invoke fasting periods of sufficient duration or promote consumption at appropriate times to result in improvements in glucose regulation over and above that caused by weight loss.  4.2. Dietary Compliance, Mood, Hunger and Cravings  Participants reported similarly high rates of dietary compliance (~80%) in both the IFT and continuous energy restriction (CER)T groups.",6e51d966-650f-470a-96b9-a22512a8e8b7
24,methods24," These results are comparable to those of most other studies that have compared 5:2 IF and continuous energy restriction (CER), which reported compliance rates in the range of 56–97% over 3 months, with no differences between diets [31,35,36,37]. However, a number of factors in the present study likely promoted high levels of dietary compliance in both groups. First, participants were in regular contact with the study dietitian, who was also the strength and conditioning coach, during the supervised resistance training sessions, and frequency of contact likely improves compliance in dieting individuals [38]. Secondly, customised meal plans for each participant that were tailored to individual preferences and habitual diet [39,40], as well as the provision of meal replacement shakes [41] on fasting days for those in the IFT group. may have further helped to promote compliance.",aff817d3-2279-4265-8d4e-5c83c5180c9f
25,methods25," Lastly, participants were asked to self-record their dietary intake three times during the course of the study; however, many decided to track their intake continuously throughout the 12-week intervention. Self-monitoring dietary intake has been consistently shown to improve compliance with weight-loss regimens [42]. Importantly, these strategies are largely consistent with previous studies that have compared 5:2 and continuous energy restriction (CER), which have generally provided regular dietary counselling or motivational support while also providing meal plans or food portion lists for individuals [31,32,36,37,43]. Although these strategies may help improve study fidelity, it is intriguing to consider how these diets might compare without the same level of support. Nonetheless, our findings add further weight to the notion that individuals show high levels of compliance to either diet in the short-to-medium term when combined with adequate professional support.",5cc58623-1b9b-4919-a117-c23afacb2eed
26,methods26,"  In the current study, participants reported relatively low levels of hunger. It is often proposed that hunger may be a limiting factor with respect to the success of restrictive diets, especially with IF [43]. Whereas a number of other studies have shown that hunger does not differ between those following an IF-style diet compared to continuous energy restriction (CER) [32,35], one longer-term intervention (1 year) showed that hunger levels were higher in those undertaking IF [43]. Together with our results, this suggests that hunger is unlikely to undermine compliance with either diet, at least in the short-to-medium term, although more longer-term studies including measures of hunger are necessary. Conversely, cravings appeared to be relatively high in both groups in the current study, which could compromise long-term compliance with either diet.",be42673d-cb2b-4bb7-8ae7-01013d1e4d75
27,methods27," Despite similar levels of hunger and cravings reported between dietary groups, there were clear differences in such ratings between fasting and fed days in the IFT group. Participants reported significantly higher levels of hunger and cravings, as well as slightly reduced mood and energy levels on fasting days compared to fed days. However, compliance was still high on fasting days, potentially indicating the acceptability of short-term, severe restriction.  Mood was positively correlated with compliance in both groups, perhaps signifying greater ability of participants to comply with their assigned diet when their mood was better (although not precluding the possibility that greater compliance led to improved mood). The continuous energy restriction (CER)T group showed a significant negative correlation between hunger and mood, as well as between hunger and compliance—associations not observed in the IFT group.",ab80d740-e14a-4a38-9dc2-cb648ba39434
28,methods28," On the other hand, participants in the IFT group appeared to experience a reprieve from high levels of hunger and poorer mood on non-fasting days, reporting significantly lower ratings compared to fed days. This is an important consideration for practitioners when recommending dietary interventions, given that an individual’s capacity to self-regulate may be limited. Furthermore, given the tendency of individuals to adopt an ‘all-or-nothing’ approach to dieting, a dietary lapse can often lead to reactionary overeating [44], compromising weight loss. continuous energy restriction (CER) provides a greater opportunity for this to occur than IF, which could be exacerbated if this type of dieting also causes poorer mood. Nonetheless, this is speculative, and there remains a paucity of long-term studies that include measures of compliance, hunger and mood.",5bac282a-03d9-4ec2-849a-9331ccc41986
29,methods29,"  Following the completion of the intervention period, participants were asked to rate the ease with which they were able to comply with their diet. Participants rated IFT and continuous energy restriction (CER)T as a 6.6 and 7.1 out of 10, respectively. These values are lower than those reported in other studies at 3, 6 and 12 months when comparing 5:2 IF and continuous energy restriction (CER) [43]. This may have been due to the nature of the prescribed diets, namely a higher recommended protein intake and liquid meals on fasting days for the IFT group. Nearly half of all participants in the current study reported difficulty meeting the protein targets (IFT = 5, continuous energy restriction (CER)T = 10), and half of those in the IFT group noted that they would have preferred solid foods instead of liquid meals on fasting days. This was reflected further in the intentions of the participants at the end the intervention period.",e168d6c4-7658-43d8-831c-a2f4e1eb9292
30,methods30," Whereas a large majority indicated they would continue with their diet protocols post intervention, only a few intended to continue as originally prescribed. Common changes that participants planned to make were a reduction in protein, regardless of dietary group, as well as a reduction in the number of fasting days and/or the use of solid meals instead of liquid meals on fasting days for those in the IFT group. Interestingly, in one of the few other studies to utilise liquid meals for their 5:2 IF fasting group, Harvie et al. [31] showed that a much smaller proportion of 5:2 IF participants (58%) planned to continue with their diet after the 6-month intervention compared to the continuous energy restriction (CER) group (85%). Conversely, Sundfør et al. [4] showed that participants in both 5:2 IF (utilising consumption of solid food on fasting days) and continuous energy restriction (CER) diet groups had comparably strong intentions to continue with their diet after 12 months.",e1a31a94-c6a2-466f-aab7-1ea238b3315d
31,methods31," Thus, although both diets appear to be tolerable, flexibility and customisation with regard to how energy deficits are implemented may be important for long-term compliance. It should also be noted that the vast majority of participants from both groups (continuous energy restriction (CER)T = 14, IFT = 13) reported difficulty complying with their diet during social situations, with 1 participant in the IFT group also reporting avoiding going out on fasting days. This could also have implications for long-term compliance and quality of life, further emphasising the need for interventions that allow for some flexibility.  There were a number of strengths of this study. First, both diets were matched for protein intake and energy restriction; therefore, any differences observed between groups may be more likely due to differing intake patterns (i.e., IF versus continuous energy restriction (CER)) rather than major differences in nutrient intake.",45d55e74-7771-43a2-9412-34d04dfc8fb9
32,methods32," Secondly, we utilised continuous data to analyse dietary compliance, as well as changes in hunger, cravings and mood, with questionnaires based on previously validated scales. However, our study is also subject to several limitations. Despite the continuous nature of the questionnaires, the frequency of the collection (i.e., daily) also led to decreased response rates over time and potentially introduced habituality to the nature of responses. Furthermore, a lack of preintervention testing precluded analysis of baseline differences in hunger, cravings and mood. We also failed to take into account menstrual cycles in women, which may impact a number of the variables we measured, in particular, hunger, cravings and mood. Finally and importantly, this study was powered to detect differences in the primary outcome for this intervention (lean body mass); therefore the results should be interpreted with caution and considered exploratory.",21083eb4-e130-4556-b8ff-12774259fdcd
