All subjects who visited the University Hospital Sharjah (University Hospital Sharjah (UHS)), UAE, for screening were recruited for this study. All subjects were Arabs from the Arabian Gulf, Iraq, Egypt, Sudan, Tunisia, and the Levant countries (Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Palestine).

Subjects were recruited using personal communication, social media, and institutional emails. All subjects attended the University Hospital Sharjah (UHS) for screening and investigations and provided signed informed consent to participate in this study. Subjects were men and women who were of either normal weight or overweight/obesity (body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2) and decided to fast Ramadan and were willing to participate in this study. We have collected basic and sociodemographic data using a self-report questionnaire that covered the medical history and demographic information.

Study Design  A prospective observational study design was used to investigate the effect of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene expressions along with variable anthropometric, metabolic, and inflammatory markers in subjects with overweight and obesity. Data were collected at baseline (2–7 days before Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF)) and after completing 28–30 consecutive days of diurnal Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF). During the fasting month of Ramadan, individuals abstain from all foods and drinks (including water) from dawn to sunset, with the average fasting duration being 15 h per day.",384155a4-ff19-4516-9580-09d2dbeb23cf

All subjects were asked to pursue habitual lifestyle patterns during both fasting and non-fasting hours. According to Islamic laws of fasting, menstruating women are exempted from observing Ramadan fasting during their period; hence, the fasting period for participating women was less than that for men (23–25 vs. 28–30 days).  Anthropometric Assessment  Anthropometric measurements were taken at two time points (before and at the end of commencement of 28–30 fasting days). Anthropometric measures of body weight, fat mass, and body fat percentage, and fat-free mass were measured using segmental multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (DSM-BIA; TANITA, MC-980, Tokyo/Japan) before and at the end of the fasting month.",107ae909-210a-4214-8aed-65413ba28ca5

Height was measured using a fixed stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm. body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height in m2. Waist and hip circumference were measured to the nearest 0.01 m using a non-stretchable measuring tape (Seca, Hamburg/Germany), and their ratio was calculated accordingly.  Dietary Intake Assessment  No special dietary recommendations or food regimens were given to the study subjects during any stage of the study, and all the subjects were asked to pursue their habitual dietary patterns during the eating period before and during Ramadan.",097538c8-7532-42e8-a17b-63a0a2ed7107
5,methods5," Dietary intakes were assessed by trained nutritionists using the 24-h recall technique on 3 days (one weekend day and two weekdays) at the two-time points (before and at the end of Ramadan fasting). Printed two-dimensional food models were used to help study subjects approximate the eaten portion sizes. Dietary intakes of energy (calories), macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fats, and water), and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) were estimated using the Food Processor software (version 10.6 ESHA Research, Salem, OR/USA).  Physical Activity Level  The Dietary Reference Intakes classification for general physical activity level was used to assess subjects' level of physical activity (40). This classification depends on the general physical exercise pattern. Subjects were considered highly active if they performed at least 2 h per day of moderate-intensity physical exercise or 1 h of vigorous exercise in addition to daily living activities.",29fa58e8-01f0-4016-af0c-9a8737982531

Subjects that performed 30 mins to 1 h per day of moderate-intensity physical exercise in addition to daily living activities were considered to have low activity. Finally, subjects who performed daily living activities without other physical exercise were considered sedentary (40).  Blood Sampling  A sample of 10 ml of blood was collected from subjects at baseline in 3 different tubes including red top (plain) for serum, purple top (EDTA) for plasma and RNA extraction, and gray top (sodium fluoride) for glucose level (before commencing fasting) and at the end of the fasting month.

Considering the lack of reference range for fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene expression, six subjects with normal body mass index (BMI) (21.4 ± 2.20 kg/m2) were recruited only to get the normal fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) expression levels at the two points (before and after Ramadan fasting). For overweight/obese subjects, at each time point, the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene expression was first calculated relative to the housekeeping (RPL18) gene, then as a fold-change compared to the gene expression for the normal reference levels obtained from subjects with normal body mass index (BMI).

19,discussion0," The current study provides the first evidence of a link between Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) and the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene expression in a cohort of overweight/obese subjects who observed Ramadan fasting (28 days for an average of 15 h/day). There was an association between reduced fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) expression and favorable effects, as demonstrated by suppression of pro-inflammatory markers and improvement of the lipid profile. Above all, such an association was also accompanied by a reduction of body mass index (BMI) and waist/hip ratio denoting that the effect of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) may be explained, at least in part, by its link to the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) expression. Several human studies showed beneficial effects of IF (17, 19, 21, 44, 45).",816711f4-5277-492b-96b6-a2075207d53a
20,discussion1," Recently, a growing body of evidence suggests substantial health implications for the religious form of IF, with the Ramadan model as one of the most extensively studied forms with variable anthropometric, metabolic, and inflammatory impacts (25–29, 31, 32). The main distinctive features of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) in comparison to other patterns of IF models are presented in the fact that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) involves diurnal, dawn to sunset, IF for 29–30 consecutive days with complete abstinence from food and drink, including water. Other models of IF include modified fasting regimens (involves consumption of 20–25% of energy needs on scheduled fasting days such as 5:2 diet), TRE (allows ad libitum nutrient and energy intake within specific time frames, and inducing regular, extended fasting intervals, mostly nocturnal fasting), and alternate-day fasting (allows alternating fasting days with eating days) (45).",2ee2711a-d2a2-4a51-9f48-3b4ea3bab89d
21,discussion2,"  In the current study, Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) reduced body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat percent, waist circumference; Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) also resulted in a reduction of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), with increased HDL. This is in support of the previous reports on the favorable effect of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on the cardiometabolic risk factor profile. In our recent meta-analysis, we demonstrated the favorable effect of IF on reducing total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), triglyceride levels as well as diastolic blood pressure and heart rate (26). The study included subgroup analysis of age, sex, and duration of fasting (as confounding factors) and the significant favorable effect of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) was constantly evident in all subgroups. Concordant with our findings in the current and previous studies, Mindikoglu et al.",bfa314cd-6aa0-4b24-86ff-c9fc120b90cb
22,discussion3," showed that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) resulted in a significant reduction of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and improvement in blood pressure, with an anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, and anti-aging serum proteome response, providing another dimension for the benefits of IF that is likely to be promoted by cytokine modulation (46).  The observed changes in the total energy and dietary intakes from different macro and micronutrients are repeatedly shown in several studies (30, 32), and consistent with the recent work that compared dietary intakes from different food groups and macronutrients in a comparative study using the year-round dietary intakes (23).  fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) expression is different in underfeeding and fasting conditions and displays tissue-specific differences in mouse models of obesity, but it is not known whether these differences are the cause or the consequence of obesity (47).",affc7223-48a3-46aa-940c-fe812c67428b
23,discussion4," fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) mRNA expression in mice and humans is broadly distributed in many organs, with notably high levels of expression in the brain and hypothalamus, which regulate energy balance and hunger (48, 49). Previous studies showed that tissue-specific genes may be expressed in a wider variety of tissues. When transcriptomics analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was compared to that of liver, kidney, stomach, spleen, prostate, lung, heart, colon, and brain, more than 80% of shared differentially expressed genes (50). Also, other reports suggested that PBMCs can represent a surrogate indicator in dietary investigations to identify differentially expressed genes in population studies (51, 52). In mice, the expression of fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) may be influenced by their dietary condition (53).",073306c9-6369-4d58-b92a-1b1e5392cb2b
24,discussion5," When mice are fasting, there is a strong stimulus to eat, and their hypothalamus fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) mRNA expression is significantly reduced compared to their fed counterparts. Supplementation with the anti-hunger hormone leptin does not reverse this effect, which suggests that the reduced hypothalamic fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) expression observed during fasting is independent of leptin levels (54). These findings show that fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) is downregulated during fasting and increased during feeding and that a decrease in fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) expression or activity might be a signal that encourages overeating and obesity. Noteworthy, the results in rats are different; possibly because of inconsistency in the conditions of different studies and the different sensitivity to starvation among different species.",263b3160-6f0a-413b-91f7-731876ae0952
25,discussion6," Murine fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene expression was shown to be downregulated under fasting conditions, suggesting that obese mouse models mimic the fasted state, possibly contributing to their over-eating (47).  Interestingly, fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) was highly expressed in the cerebellum, salivary gland, and kidney of adult pigs, whereas it was not detected in blood (55). The latter study showed fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) was positively associated with energy intake in the pancreas, and with age in the muscle, adding to the multiple factors that affect fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) expression. Such variation can be explained by different metabolic and secretion activities of different tissues at different age groups. Moreover, as previously described with leptin, diurnal variation may also affect the level of expression of fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) (56).",5395ca50-22ac-43d1-a2ca-b4fb60e87b90
26,discussion7," The link of fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) expression to fasting and obesity is not yet fully elucidated in humans, where more factors may interplay to determine this effect. Such factors include the effect of food predilection, dietary patterns, and complexity of gut-brain networking including leptin, ghrelin, among other key players (57). Our current study highlights the reduction of fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) in overweight/obese subjects as a consequence of observing diurnal IF for four consecutive weeks.  Furthermore, the current study showed a reduction in both pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6, TNF-α. Concordantly, in a study by Faris et al. significant reductions in IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were reported in fasting subjects during Ramadan of both sexes, when compared to basal pre-fasting values obtained 1 week before Ramadan (32).",a76037d2-6765-428b-ada1-1fb03dc172fc
27,discussion8," Furthermore, this finding is consistent with the results of a meta-analysis and original research showing that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) is associated with significant reductions in serum proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) and hs-CRP, and the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde and urinary 15-f(2t)-isoprostane (32, 33). The current findings on the significant reductions in lipid profile components (TC, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and TG) and increased HDL are consistent with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses showing that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) is associated with such improvements in the cardiometabolic risk factors (26, 27). As shown by Faris and colleagues (30), these reductions in the proinflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory adipokines were reported to be associated with significant reductions in visceral adiposity in obese subjects who observed the 4-week dawn to sunset IF of Ramadan.",1238f985-793e-4b22-803a-c0fc144993ac
28,discussion9," Experimentally, fasting reduced TNF-α in visceral white adipose tissue, IL-1β in subcutaneous tissue, as well as insulin and leptin in the plasma in stressed rats (58).  The current study showed that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) increased IL-10, which is consistent with a previous study by Faris et al. among obese subjects observing Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) when compared with the pre-fasting levels (30). IL-10 has a strong immune-modulation activity (59). It is thought of as an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress cytokine production from macrophages and the function of neutrophils (60, 61) but can activate CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells for anti-viral immunity, denoting its dual role in immunity (62, 63). Intriguingly, the IL-10 signaling pathway was one of the top Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) in COVID-19 infected normal epithelium vs.",72e4efd3-9914-430d-a4a0-ec894ac1868f

These findings denote that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) exerts its beneficial effects independently from the dietary and anthropometric factors, through different pathways that may or may not involve weight reduction and lower energy intake. Such dissociation between the beneficial effect of IF and caloric restriction is supported by previous work on rodents (66) who found that IF has beneficial effects in experimental mice reported on glucose regulation and neuronal resistance to injury that are independent of caloric intake.",e422e04d-513b-40bd-8922-ad81bafc065e
30,discussion11," Several proteins interact with the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO); the most significant of which is Melanocortin receptor 4 (MCR4) that is co-expressed with the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) in some species. The MCR4 is involved in energy balance as well as somatic growth (67).  Pharmacologic treatments cannot reset the circadian clock rhythm; thus, there is an urgent need for an effective intervention to reset the circadian clock and prevent metabolic syndrome and metabolic syndrome-induced cancers (68, 69). However, IF practiced exclusively during human activity hours can reset the circadian rhythm. Therefore, resetting the disrupted circadian clock in humans by consecutive daily IF could provide a primary strategy to improve metabolic syndrome and reduce the incidence of metabolic syndrome-induced cancer (68, 69).",c114bc97-673d-4be4-86e2-4bbd40a4cec5
31,discussion12," Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) upregulated several key regulatory proteins that play a key role in tumor suppression, DNA repair, insulin signaling, glucose, and lipid metabolism, circadian clock, cytoskeletal remodeling, immune system, and cognitive function (70).  Nonetheless, our results indicate a lack of association between fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene expression and caloric intake by the fasting people. This notion may appear inconsistent with the evident association between intakes of calories, carbohydrates, and fats with the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) genotype (67), given some studies that showed a correlation of the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) risk allele and high fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene expression (68, 69). Moreover, it has been reported that the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) genotype may influence dietary macronutrient intakes, body weight, energy balance, appetite, and hormone secretion (70, 71).",f81acb93-6e65-44c1-9df5-8d2ce4b99248
32,discussion13," The SNPs of the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene are likely associated with food intake and obesity through modifying the expression of other genes (72). Until now, there is no strong evidence for the association of fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) A risk allele and level of gene expression. There is a recognized association of the A risk allele of fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) rs9939609 and overweight worldwide (48, 71) in several Arab populations (72–75). In this study, we did not investigate the subjects' genotypes, as the study group is not from the same ethnicity. In our previous study on the Emirati population, the rs9939609 AA genotype was significantly associated with higher body mass index (BMI); in females, but not in males (76). In another study by our group, subjects with rs9939609 AA genotype showed significantly higher fasting glucose compared to other genotypes, with a trend of higher insulin levels and HOMA2-IR (77).",3b51b5e6-ba1e-4a36-9e09-94d6c8059309
33,discussion14," We recently correlated the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) genotypes, as well as FGF21 genotypes to dietary patterns in the Emirati population (78). Whether the outcome of a caloric intervention is affected by fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) rs 9939609 A risk allele is weakly evident (79).  A few limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of the current work. First, causality cannot be inferred, as the design is observational prospective in nature. Hence, undetected confounding factors could be involved in the downregulation or upregulation of the tested fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene upon Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF). Changes in circadian rhythm and sleep patterns that have been reported to affect the expression of some genes (37) are among the factors that may be implicated in changing fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene expression.",3a8b58b6-51bf-459a-b779-f78cac16f995
34,discussion15," Tissue- and age-specific variations of fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) expression also add to the complexity of the interpretation of its expression in the blood. Although the practice of physical exercise did not change during Ramadan month in comparison with the pre-fasting stage, still this factor may be of paramount effect, and objective measurements have to be applied in measuring physical exercise levels in the forthcoming studies.  Conclusions  Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) is linked to the downregulation of fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene expression in subjects with obesity, which might explain, at least in part, its beneficial metabolic benefits. Consequently, Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) may have a preventive effect against body weight increase and associated negative metabolic-related derangements in overweight/obese people, possibly through modulation of fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene expression.",3b927664-93b7-45ed-92a1-b86e3cde7875
