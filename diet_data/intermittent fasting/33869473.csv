Bioinformatics Pipeline: Image analysis and base calling were performed with Illumina CASAVA pipeline and 125bp/150 base pairs paired-end reads were generated. FastQC (fastqc_v0.11.5) was used to check the quality of the raw reads. Trim Galore was used to trim the adaptor sequences and to automate quality. Bowtie2 was used to map the sequences to a reference genome and for alignment. Bismark software (version 0.16.3) was also used for alignment of bisulfite-treated reads to a reference genome and to filter the reads after alignment.

21,results1,"  Intermittent Fasting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) Methylation White Matter Lesion Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion Vascular Cognitive Impairment Vascular Dementia ==== Body pmcIntroduction  Vascular dementia (VaD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that results in cognitive impairment and memory loss, and is the second leading cause of dementia worldwide 1. It has a rapid, stepwise decline in disease progression and hence an associated high mortality rate 2. With age being a major risk factor, coupled with a rapidly aging population, VaD is of increasing concern warranting the need to address the issue urgently 1. Some of the clinical characteristic features of VaD include mainly reduced cerebral blood flow (cerebral blood flow (CBF)), increase in white matter hyperintensities and impaired blood brain barrier integrity 1. While the hallmarks of VaD pathology are well described, the underlying pathological mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated.",7ed4a627-66e6-4fb8-8c65-6fdd447daf63
22,results2," This has resulted in the treatments for VaD to be purely symptomatic or focused on stroke prevention. Nevertheless, the risk factors for VaD which are rather well described, aid in the diagnosis of patients due to the role played in disease onset and its progression. These risk factors include age, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, alcohol consumption and stress 3. With most risk factors being attributed to lifestyle-associated factors, there are also several lines of evidence which show that the environment plays a key role in driving the pathogenesis of VaD. Post-mortem and case studies of dementia patients suggest that gene-environment interactions may underlie dementia 4, but its regulatory role in VaD remains uncharacterised.  These gene-environment interactions, otherwise known as epigenetic changes, involves alterations of gene expression without any changes made to the deoxyribonucleic acid (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)) sequence itself 5.",3e5b7f1a-5c70-4578-9e41-140f1c0d51cb
23,results3," There are three main epigenetic mechanisms, namely deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNA 6. Of these three, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation is the most widely studied which plays a key role in regulating cellular processes 5 and is the most upstream in the epigenetic hierarchy as well. It involves the covalent transfer of a methyl group to the C5 position of the cytosine ring of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 7. deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation is generally associated to transcriptional repression of gene expression. In terms of the existing evidence exploring the role of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape in animal models of VaD, there are only two existing studies 5, 8. However, in both these studies, the animal model used is an occlusion model whereby there is a complete blockage of blood vessels and hence blood supply, thus incurring acute damage.",9ba05d89-733e-40a5-a4cd-38b573687813
24,results4," This does not represent the chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) state observed in VaD patients and also results in damage to the visual pathway, which does not occur in patients. Hence, there is an impending need to study the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape in a suitable model of VaD. The Bilateral Common Carotid Artery Stenosis (Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS)) is a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) model which is known to be the most promising model of VaD 1. Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) very closely mimics the conditions in VaD patients with increased white matter lesions, impaired blood brain barrier integrity, increased inflammatory response and reduced brain metabolism alongside a chronic reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF).  Given the implications of the gene-environment interaction in VaD and the contribution of lifestyle-associated risk factors, changes to diet and lifestyle could prove to be useful.",1df32df8-b295-4ef3-b7b2-eb7fb06b5155
25,results5," With the metabolic syndrome playing a key role in driving disease pathogenesis, metabolic regulation in the form of altered dietary patterns could perhaps help to slow down if not prevent disease progression. Of the different dietary regimens, intermittent fasting (IF) has been shown to be protective against age-related neurological diseases 9. While, a few studies which show that IF physiologically modulates deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation 10-12, further validation and extensive studies are required to assess its benefits especially in a pathological state such as that in VaD. Essentially, the presence of, if any, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape changes and their regulations under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) remain uncharacterised. The potential of IF as a prophylactic therapeutic intervention also remains untapped.",99947223-223e-4891-a6b6-12e194bbc848
26,results6," Therefore, to address these gaps, this study for the first time, 1) investigates the effect of IF on the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape under physiological conditions, 2) investigates how the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape changes in a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) mouse model of VaD, and 3) explores the role of prophylactic IF as a modifier of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape in a pathological state. Here we show that the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape is altered in a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) mouse model of VaD. Mapping of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation patterns under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) in the AL-fed and IF mice provided insights into the landscape present under the diseased state compared to when a prophylactic intervention is introduced.",31af97ad-dc93-4713-a776-710bf7a3a6a3
27,results7," Furthermore, IF mice subjected to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) displayed significantly better learning ability and reduced latency and significant protection against chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced neuropathological alterations.   Intermittent fasting (IF) induces a metabolic switch and improves working memory and modulates the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape under physiological conditions  To validate the effectiveness of implementing IF, the body weight, blood glucose and ketone levels of the mice were regularly measured. The body weight of IF mice were significantly lower than the ad libitum (AL) fed mice (Figure S1A). This was consistently observed during the intervention period of 6 months. The possibility of caloric restriction (CR) as a confounder for the observed weight loss was minimised by monitoring the food consumption of the AL fed and IF mice where the latter showed a 9.",a9670791-61de-4fa9-ab6d-2cccec57a323

The blood glucose and ketone levels were also monitored in the mice to determine the effectiveness of the IF regimen. Evidently, the blood glucose levels were observed to be generally lower in the IF mice then the AL-fed mice (Figure S1B). The ketone levels were significantly higher in the IF mice as opposed to the AL-fed mice (Figure S1B), thus indicating a metabolic switch.  To investigate whether IF improves cognitive function and modulates the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape under normal physiological condition, behavioural assessment and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS)) were performed and compared between AL wildtype (AL wildtype (ALWT)) and IFWT mice respectively.",dcc279be-9e41-4c6a-86af-6af477f091be

The global deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation levels in AL wildtype (ALWT) and IFWT mice were visualised using heatmaps, violin plots and circos representation graphs. While deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation is found in three different contexts: CG, CHG and CHH, the role of CHG and CHH remain unknown. Therefore, the effect of IF on the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape was analysed in all three different contexts for preliminary investigations.",01c774f1-95a2-443b-96c3-c638f056a38f

This deviation in methylation status in IFWT mice was towards the hypomethylated state. The differentially methylated regions (differentially methylated region (DMR)s) in the IFWT mice had a generally lower global methylation level compared to the AL wildtype (ALWT) mice as represented using violin plots for all three contexts (Figure 1F-H).,ac75de34-4eb0-45d8-8128-2638f54f5573

The breakdown of the number of hypo- and hyper-methylated genes in all gene regions (Figure S2A) and those in the promoter region (Figure S2A) are analysed. In addition, how these respective hypo- and hyper-methylated genes are linked is investigated by clustering them based on their potential protein-protein interaction networks (Figure S2B-C). The Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathway analyses were also performed to better understand and interpret the potential biological role of the hypo- and hyper-methylated genes analysed (Figure S3A-F).",f99a5bd1-d5a1-4bfb-9803-b3ab438b3457

AL-fed mice subjected to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) (AL Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS)) showed significantly poorer learning ability and longer latency to enter the target quadrant as compared to the respective sham controls (Figure 2B). By contrast, IF mice subjected to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) (IF Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS)) displayed significantly better learning ability and reduced latency to reach the desired target quadrant compared to the AL Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice (Figure 2B). It is notable that there was no significant difference between the latency to reach the target quadrant between the IF Sham and IF Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice.",1e1d44cd-e508-45f9-988e-4a86a777d70c
35,results15, These changes in latency were not due to any locomotor disabilities as confirmed by the open field test (Figure 2B). Cognitive impairment is thus observed under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) and prophylactic IF ameliorates this impairment to levels comparable to that of the respective sham mice.  White matter lesions (White matter lesions (WML)s) in the caudoputamen and corpus callosum regions were visualised through Luxol fast blue staining of myelinated axons 16. The White matter lesions (WML)s observed in the AL Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice were significantly higher than in the AL Sham mice across all different timepoints (Figure 2C-D). It is notable that the White matter lesions (WML)s observed in the IF Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice was significantly reduced than in the AL Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice suggesting improvement in the neuropathological alterations (Figure 2C-D).,469f0f1d-84f2-4d70-a663-fe29e388510c
36,results16," chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced neuronal loss was evident in the hippocampal CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions in AL Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice, whereas sham controls showed normal neuronal cell bodies with distinct nuclei, nucleoli, and densely packed neurons in all three hippocampal areas (Figure 2E-F). With IF, the Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice sustained less neuronal loss (Figure 2E-F). In addition, inflammatory markers such as IBA1 was significantly lower while GFAP was significantly higher in the IF Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) group compared to AL Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice (Figure S5). Finally, a marker for myelin integrity, myelin basic protein (myelin basic protein (MBP)), was determined to be significantly higher in the IF Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) group in comparison to AL Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice (Figure S5).",5692a085-d1d7-44a7-9510-8594d777bc87

The global deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation pattern in the AL Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice exhibited distinct deviation from the respective sham controls as observed in the heatmap plotted for DMGs (Figure 3A). This deviance in differential methylation from the control group was consistently observed across all three timepoints of the AL Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice. With IF, the Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice showed deviance in methylation profile from the AL Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice (Figure 3B).",79964a11-197a-492d-850d-94facbf1b6e1

In addition, 41 genes were commonly differentially methylated across the three different timepoints. These results confirm that the global deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape is altered under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) state.  In contrast to the AL-fed mice, there was a consistent decrease in trend of hypomethylation observed across all three timepoints of the IF mice subjected to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) (Figure 3D) suggesting a reversal in methylation trends.",039e4272-2ee3-46ed-9ff2-364d62a395b1

Identification of all differentially methylated genes (DMGs) under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) with intermittent fasting (IF)  We separately analysed the hyper- and hypo-methylated genes to narrow down their potential functions under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) (Table S2).

49,results29,"  Analysing the methylation levels of these overlapping DMGs under a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) pathological state and when subjected to prophylactic IF revealed temporal regulation (Figure 4F-G). The temporal regulation of the gene's methylation level is unique to each gene and in some cases (i.e. DDX3Y, Guanine Nucleotide binding protein Alpha Stimulating (GNAS), PAX6, ZRSR1) the change is significant enough to switch from a hypermethylated to hypomethylated state or vice versa. It is notable that Striated Muscle Enriched Protein Kinase (SPEG) and ACTG1 genes are present in the overlapping genes across the timepoints under the diseased state and when subjected to IF. Both these genes were hypermethylated across all three timepoints under the AL-fed state (Figure 4F).

50,discussion0," The gene-environment interaction in the context of VaD has been implicated with the observation of environmental factors such as diet, stress and smoking may drive the pathogenesis of the disease 17,18. However, this implication has yet to be substantiated with molecular reasoning and underpinnings. This study, therefore, focused on the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape in the brain under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) in a mouse model of VaD. In addition, a prophylactic intervention of IF was introduced to study its modulation of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape. Proof-of-concept experiments were conducted to ensure that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) was successfully induced in the Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mouse model utilised.",722c0954-8c75-454f-ae23-5f36b9f87805
51,discussion1," A reduction in body weight is a distinct phenomenon in IF conditions where it is speculated to be due to lowered insulin levels and increased growth hormone release which result in catabolism of fats, thus lowering body weight 19. Under fasting conditions, the body shifts its metabolic activity from lipid synthesis and fat storage to mobilising breakdown of fats via fatty-acid oxidation and production of fatty-acid derived ketones 20. This flip in metabolic activity was observed in the IF mice as well.  While the beneficial effects of IF have been established, the role it plays in modulating the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape per se, if any, is not well explored. So far, there are only a few studies that have investigated the altered deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape in an alternate-day fasting regimen in liver and skeletal muscle 12,21,22.",860af56e-ee63-4df9-9c43-12dc8d50ac85
52,discussion2," However, to our knowledge, the effect of IF (16 h regimen) on the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape of mouse brain under physiological conditions is not characterised. The AL wildtype (ALWT) vs IFWT analysis thus serves as evidence for an altered deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation profile with the administration of prophylactic IF. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape was analysed according to three different contexts (CG, CHG and CHH). This was in view of the unknown role played by the non-canonical methylation sites (i.e. CHG and CHH contexts) which could provide insights into the modulation of gene expression 23. It is notable that the global deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation favours hypomethylation. However, the abundance of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)s are significantly higher in IFWT mice which implies greater hypermethylation due to the addition of methyl groups.",b9fc3985-578f-48e8-963c-9507864f9578
53,discussion3," This difference could be attributed to the gene region at which the methylation occurs. Increased methylation in non-promoter regions is less likely to affect modulation of gene expression, thus resulting in a hypomethylated state despite the increase in DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) levels. IF showed improvement in the long term retention phase of memory and better spatial retrieval memory highlighting the prolonged effect of IF on working memory, which is consistent with exisiting findings 24,25.  The cerebral blood flow (CBF) readings serve as an immediate indication of the reduced blood supply to the brain. In addition to serving as a validation, these proof-of-concept experiments highlighted the effect of IF at a pathophysiological level as well.

They were assessed for disarrangement of nerve fibres, marked vacuoles and/or disappearance of myelinated fibres as characterised by Wakita and colleagues (1994) 28. While the increased lesions under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) was observed as expected, the reduced marked vacuoles in the IF mice suggested improvement in neuropathological severity. The amelioration of cognitive impairment in IF mice under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is evidence for the promise IF holds as a prophylactic intervention. Notably, a differential effect of reduced IBA1 levels and elevated GFAP levels were observed with the introduction of prophylactic IF.",916c3f5c-51c4-4b65-9123-8f58384beef8
55,discussion5," In general, astrocytes have been shown to be more resistant to ischemia than neurons and microglia 29-31. Consistent with the literature, it is observed that in our study, under AL-fed chronic cerebral hypoperfusion conditions, the GFAP levels were not significantly different from the respective sham group (i.e. AL CCH mice (ALB)30D vs ALS30D) (Figure S5). However, IBA1 levels showed a significant difference between AL CCH mice (ALB)30D and ALS30D groups (p<0.05; not included in the figure). Hence, it can be interpreted that the ischemic event impacts the microglia more than the astrocytes, thus resulting in intermittent fasting to lower the IBA1 levels to mitigate the damage. On the contrary, the elevated GFAP levels in the IF CCH mice (IFB)30D mice compared to the AL CCH mice (ALB)30D mice can be attributed to the fact that astrocyte reactivity is dynamic and has highly variable outcomes.",a0dc936a-0c33-4e37-ba87-09e819c03c63
56,discussion6," Reactive astrocytes have been demonstrated to play a protective role under ischemic conditions 32. Studies have shown that astrocytic activation can stimulate two types of astrocytes, the A1 astrocytes which are neurotoxic and A2 astrocytes which have neuroprotective properties 33. In fact, ischemia is known to induce A2 astrocytes which in turn have been observed to induce the production of cytokines such as TNF-α. While TNF-α has been well established as a proinflammatory cytokine, it has been recently found to have an anti-inflammatory role as well. Notably, under ischemic conditions, TNF-α inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines and it has also demonstrated the ability to stimulate development of synapses and ensuring the survival of neurons 34. IF has been shown to elicit beneficial effects which include inducing anti-inflammatory responses or attenuating pro-inflammatory responses 35, 36.",18710bb8-028d-4614-8a35-068355684646
57,discussion7," Hence, the increase in GFAP levels in IF CCH mice (IFB)30D mice could be due to the increase in neuroprotective A2 astrocyte phenotype.  Mapping of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation patterns under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) in the AL fed and IF mice provided insights into the landscape present under the diseased state versus when an intervention is established. Sorting of gene regions to be primarily from the CG context stems from the fact that CpG islands (CG dinuleotide rich islands (CGI)s) with high nucleotide density is where deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation predominantly occurs in mammals 37. There are two main layers of findings elucidated from the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape observed. One is the deviation of methylation profile in a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) state from baseline. The other is the deviation of methylation profile in IF mice under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) compared to the AL fed mice.",90d61a45-2452-46f1-a58f-951f17e42c29
58,discussion8," While the deviation from point of comparison highlights the modulatory changes, the exact trend and its implications are determined based on the DEGs identified.  The analysis of overlapping DEGs in the hypermethylated and hypomethylated states provides understanding of the functional implications regarding the changes in the methylation profile. Both AL-fed and IF mice which underwent chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) had overlapping DEGs respectively which were all associated to at least one neurodegenerative disease, specifically under the umbrella term of dementia. This includes diseases like AD, Frontotemporal dementia (Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)), Parkinsonism, VaD and mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The presence of dementia-related genes in this mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) serves as preliminary validation to mimic the conditions observed in patients.",bf02ed78-46e7-432c-a9c0-78d22c461b9c
59,discussion9," While there are different permutations of analysis that can be performed, the overlapping DEGs were first studied as they would facilitate the understanding of temporal regulation of the genes. In addition, the sorting of the overlapping DEGs is important to distinguish the hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes. Knowing the functions of these genes is more important as they provide an understanding of their role in the system involved. For instance, ABCC4 is hypermethylated in AL-fed mice and hypomethylated in IF mice when subjected to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). ABCC4 plays a key role in the vascular system by ensuring cyclic adenosine monophosphate homeostasis 38. Under physiological conditions, ABCC4 functions as an active transporter at the membrane to eliminate drugs and endogenous molecules and when its expression is inhibited, promotion of cardiac hypertrophy and induction of thrombopathy have been observed 38.",243ce3f4-170a-4c1b-8586-709b730a03fb
60,discussion10," Hence, the hypomethylation of ABCC4 in IF mice under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) in contrast to the hypermethylated state in AL-fed mice suggests possible restoration of function with increased gene expression. Similarly, the gene Striated Muscle Enriched Protein Kinase (SPEG) is hypermethylated in AL-fed mice and hypomethylated in IF mice under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), which translates to a reduction and and increased gene expression respectively. It has been shown that Striated Muscle Enriched Protein Kinase (SPEG) gene is crucial for cardiac development and function and downregulation of its expression is observed in human failing hearts and cardiac dysfunctions in mouse models 39. Moreover, genes such as ECE1 and FGFR2 which are hypomethylated in IF mice under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) have been shown to confer neuroprotection.",e93c91f3-f8f8-4c0b-9018-a79fe1f92fef
61,discussion11," A genetic association study showed that ECE1 is expressed in human cerebral cortex and that it potentially confers protection against AD 40. FGFR2, on the other hand, has been established to play a crucial role in neuroprotection, nrogenesis, nerve repair and hippocampal learning 41-43. Hence, this trend of differential methylation between AL-fed and IF mice highlights the promise IF holds in countering the methylation changes induced under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH).  It is notable that in both these above-mentioned set of analyses, the hypo- and hypermethylated status were contributed by the cumulative methylation levels of the different gene regions such as exons, introns, promoters and transcription start and end sites. Hence, there is a need for a focused approach to fully comprehend the effect of the methylation changes on the expression of the respective genes.",b8104e8b-b40f-4752-bc66-6c63a814804c
62,discussion12," In particular, methylation at the promoter region was investigated as their functional importance is emphasised by the CpG islands associated with the promoter region being conserved in both humans and mice and with approximately 70% of the gene promoters situated within CpG islands 44. Striated Muscle Enriched Protein Kinase (SPEG) and ACTG1 genes were present in both AL-fed and IF mice under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) which allows for analysis of two confounders- temporal regulation and the effect of prophylactic intervention. The ACTG1 gene's function is critical in cell movement and maintaining the cytoskeleton such as playing an important role synapse morphology 45. Moreover, ACTG1 expression has been reported to be correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score for AD patients and has been found to be associated with reduced levels in the blood and brain tissue of mice with AD 45.",79918fca-7d54-4410-a198-f2a30a4d9b87
63,discussion13," The completely opposing methylation status, which is temporally consistent, for the Striated Muscle Enriched Protein Kinase (SPEG) and ACTG1 genes between the AL and IF mice highlights the potential of IF to reverse the methylation landscape. As for the ZRSR1 gene, a gender-based mouse study was suggestive of the role it played in controlling behaviour through the hypothalamic cell network (46). In particular, it was shown that the ZRSR1 mutant male mice exhibited increased social interaction in contrary to the female mutant mice that showed aggressive behaviour. With an initial hypomethylation but subsequent temporal switch to a hypermethylated status in the 15 and 30-day timepoints after cerebral hypoperfusion highlights the downregulation of ZRSR1 expression and hence improved behavioural control. GNG10 expression has been associated with cognitive decline in a gene-based association study but its exact role remains unexplored 47.",87720bad-d6f6-4d61-a1e4-506b981f0f75
64,discussion14,"  DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)s, specifically DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)1, DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) 3A and 3B, have a role to play in the methylation status of the above discussed genes and hence were investigated. DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)1 serves as the main deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase in mammalian cells and is highly conserved between humans and mice. Several studies have reported observations of a global decrease in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation levels and hence an associated decrease in DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) expression levels in the brains of humans and mice in the context of aging and neurodegenerative diseases 48, 49. Apart from the observations being replicated in this study with a temporal decrease in DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)s in the AL-fed mice, a reversing trend was observed in the IF mice.",01afe7e0-7127-4851-b8f7-afbf2fa8c7d2
65,discussion15," The increase in DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)s in the IF mice was pronounced at the 30-day timepoint after cerebral hypoperfusion highlighting the promise IF holds as a prophylactic intervention.  Overall, this study demonstrates for the first time that Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS)-induced chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) altered the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape in the brain of a suitable mouse model of VaD. Furthermore, the potential of prophylactic IF in modulating the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape under physiological conditions and pathological conditions of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) was demonstrated for the first time in this study as well. In fact, IF has shown its potential to slow down the disease progression in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) by modulating the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape (Figure S6).",3d2cb81f-2f01-43fc-949d-7bbf79cadfea
66,discussion16," Hence, the addition of IF as a potential prophylactic intervention and the protection against the aberrant changes in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation landscape provides value and novelty to the study. Due to the nature of the study involving sequencing data with a wealth of information, there is still much to be explored in terms of gene clustering, narrowing down of pathways and identifying key genes that play a pivotal role in the methylation changes incurred. For instance, it is evident that the oxidative stress induced by the reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been shown to stimulate the production and release of pro-inflammatory mediators and initiate neuroinflammation in VaD 50. Neuroinflammation is an important area of focus for an upcoming study from our group.",b20692f9-70ce-43a3-a1f1-2dd979ee283e
