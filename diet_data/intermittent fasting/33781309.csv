0,background0," In recent years, intermittent fasting (IF) has gained popularity in the health and wellness in the world. There are numerous types of IF, all of which involve fasting periods that last longer than an overnight fast and involve limited meal time-windows, with or without calorie restriction. The objective of this review is to summarize the current evidence for the effects of Ramadan and non-Ramadan IF on gut microbiome. ",84d142ce-4cd1-452a-8e9f-2a0c71526f76

16,results11," Most animal studies on this interaction have been conducted in the past 5 years. Liu et al. in an experimental study compared the effect of intermediate fasting (IF) with melatonin administration on clinical variables and changes in the intestinal microbiome. They found that IF compared to the control group led to a significant increase in the abundance of Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, and Akkermansia strains. Also, they found a significant reduction in the abundance of Helicobacter, Prevotella, and Parasutterella in the IF group (14). In another study on farmed mink (Neovision vision), the gut microbiota load and diversity showed no change after 3 days of fasting. Firmicutes were as the major phylum in the gut of these animals, however the Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria also were seen in another study (15).",e18d81c2-31d4-4455-bc07-1b23481ed3c7
17,results12," The rapid movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract may not allow enough time for bacterial metabolism to provide an environment that is suitable for growth of anaerobes (16).  Beli et al., evaluated the effects of long-term IF on gut microbiome, retinopathy and prolongs survival in db/db mice. The animals were fed ad libitum (AL) before the IF was initiated at 4 months of age. The db/db mice in the intervention group were then exposed to IF daily for up to 7 months. Microbiome analysis revealed increased levels of Firmicutes and decreased levels of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia in the IF group than control. Compared to the db/db mice on AL feeding, microbiome changes in the fasting group were associated with an increase in the gut mucin, goblet cell number, villi length, and reductions in plasma peptidoglycan (12).",b7e36220-3b00-466e-844d-5a6d496d0ea1
18,results13," It has been reported in the previous studies that higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio is associated with obesity (16, 17), as well as improve energy harvesting capacity (18). In this study, researchers used measurement of plasma peptidoglycan levels as an indicator of damage to the blood-brain barrier, and the results showed that IF regimen reduced plasma peptidoglycan levels and improved blood-brain barrier integrity. It has also been shown that a decrease in peptidoglycan concentration following IF is consistent with a reduction in endotoxemia (12). Therefore, fasting diets effect on weight loss through changes in the gut microbiota diversity and number, as well as peptidoglycan production. Gut microbiota involves major energy metabolic processes (19). Some studies have found a significant association between intestinal dysbiosis and energy dysmetabolism-induced chronic diseases such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity (20).",892d3cb3-edf8-41c5-85e6-a1121f9144a0
19,results14," The positive results of the IF regimen on animal models with hypertension have also been shown in some studies (21).  Another part of animal studies has evaluated the effect of fasting on intestinal microbiome in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. Cignarella et al. evaluated the effects of IF on gut microbiome and clinical symptoms of animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS), which named experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)). They found that IF led to a significant improvement in the gut bacteria richness, enrichment of the Lactobacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Prevotellaceae families and enhanced antioxidative microbial metabolic pathways. The results of this study also showed that the IF reduced the differentiation of native T cells into T17 cells, which secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and, conversely, increased the differentiation into regulatory T cells.",7c914d30-0906-44de-b603-1855550d03c3
20,results15," Interestingly, the results of this study showed that fecal microbiome transplantation from mice under the fasting diet to mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) ameliorated the symptoms, which could indicate the positive effect of the fasting diet (22).  On the other hand, some studies have shown that IF cause weight loss, reduce lipid peroxidation, and hepatic steatosis on obese mice through changes in microbial profile. Also, it has been reported in this study that IF led to a significant increase in the intestinal flora community diversity [Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B ratio) and relative increase in the Allobaculum abundance] (23). Increasing the abundance of Firmicutes following fasting diets can increase the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs have the ability to increase the integrity of gut barrier, strengthen the immune system, reduce weight and insulin resistance (24).",28308899-34a2-4514-9124-76bfa145642e
21,results16," Moreover, fasting diets effect on the α-diversity (richness) and β-diversity (variety) of gut microbiota (12). Some pre-clinical studies have shown that IF could increase β-diversity, but the results on the effect of fasting diets on α-diversity are contradictory (12, 22, 25). Seven months IF on mice gut microbiota increased β-diversity compared in animals (12). Furthermore, weight loss introduced as the important and effective factor on α-diversity of gut microbiota (22), however it varies greatly during the day and dependents to dietary content (26, 27).  On the other hand, some studies have evaluated the effect of fasting diets on gut microbiota changes. Li et al. evaluated the effect of 12, 16, or 20-h fasting diets on the gut microbiome for 1 month. The results of this study showed that the composition of the gut microbiome changed in all types of fasting diets.",a113fc62-cce1-4312-b246-3d17d3f6fbed
22,results17," At genus level, 16 h fasting led to increased level of Akkermansia and decreased level of Alistipes, but these effects disappeared after the cessation of fasting. No taxonomic differences were identified in the other two groups (28). In some previous findings, an increase in Akkermansia strains has been associated with metabolic benefits such as a reduction in the severity of fatty liver and intestinal inflammation (29). Increased levels of Alistipes can also exacerbate gut inflammation (30, 31).  Given that different metabolites are produced by the gastrointestinal microbiome, some other studies have evaluated these metabolites produced by microbiota following fasting diets. It has been reported an increased plasma levels of some metabolites such as tryptophan, serotonin, tryptophan, various bile acids, propionate, and acetate following the administration of fasting diets in animal samples (25, 32, 33). These results have also been confirmed in some human studies (34).",5e1d94db-28a4-43d1-910e-05caf46b19e5
23,results18," Changes in the production of some metabolites can affect processes such as inflammation in the body. For example, some preclinical studies have shown that fasting diets exert inhibitory effects on the biosynthesis pathways of lipopolysaccharides by altering the intestinal microbiome. Lipopolysaccharides are among the major constituents of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and studies have shown that increased production of lipopolysaccharides can induce toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4). TLR4 represents a key receptor on which both infectious and non-infectious stimuli converge to induce a proinflammatory response (35).  Human Studies  According to the positive results of pre-clinical studies, in recent years, various human studies have evaluated the association between intestinal microbiome and fasting. In some human studies, fasting diet of Ramadan type on intestinal microbiome has been evaluated (13, 36–39). The duration of fasting time was 12–18 h per day in these studies.",8c87f8c5-3bf3-42d8-a388-fa9f0bd8a343
24,results19," The results of these studies mainly showed changes in the intestinal microbiome following adherence to Ramadan fasting, some of which are mentioned below. In a clinical study in 2021, Mohammadzadeh et al. evaluated the effect of Ramadan fasting on serum levels of butyrate, intestinal microbiome and lipid profile. The results of this study showed that the serum level of butyrate in the fasting group increased significantly after 1 month. There was also a significant increase in the bacteroides and filminus strains in the intervention group (39). In another study, which conducted on Pakistani and Chinese participants, researchers evaluated the effect of a 29-day Ramadan fasting on alpha and beta diversity. The results of this study showed that the population of some bacterial strains such as Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes increased in the Pakistani population following fasting, however no noticeable changes were observed in the Chinese population.",4285ac6f-972b-404c-84d8-fdf69ec15fc8
25,results20," In addition, it has been reported that fasting in both populations affects beta diversity. Moreover, lower levels of genus Coprococcus observed after Ramadan fasting suggesting that fasting could have implications on health. On the other hand, fasting could also have harmful effects on health (38). A study of two cohort data showed that following a Ramadan-associated IF increased microbiome diversity and was specifically associated with upregulation of the Clostridiales order–derived Lachnospiraceae. In fact, the fasting diet in this study increased the expression of butyric acid-producing Lachnospiraceae. These alternations were independent of living area, body weight and diet composition and disappeared again when fasting was stopped (13). Various studies have shown that changes in the intestinal microbiome cause changes in physiological functions and reduce energy intake. Thus, human microbiome can be an effector for physiologic effects of IF (13).",58a3e094-756f-41e5-8276-0ec1078b2f6a
26,results21," In another preliminary study, it was found that following the Islamic fasting diet caused significant changes in the intestinal microbiome, so that the number of A. muciniphila and Bacteroides fragilis group members increased, however, Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. remained relatively unchanged perhaps due to low fiber intake (36).  In addition to Ramadan fasting, some studies have examined the effect of restricted feeding in a form of IF on the intestinal microbiome. One of the major problems seen in these studies is the low sample size. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize the results of these studies to large populations. Gabei et al. in a pilot study evaluated the effect of fasting in a form of IF on the intestinal microbiome in adults with obesity. They found that IF led to a significant weight loss.",09531072-7cc5-4aaa-b0ec-0c28e84569a2
27,results22," Baseline evaluation of fecal microbiome by 16 S rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) gene sequencing showed that the predominant strains included Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. However, at the end of 12 weeks of fasting diet, no significant change was observed in the abundance and distribution of dominant bacterial strains (40). However, the results of some other studies were inconsistent with this study. Guo et al. in a RCT study were evaluated the effects of 8 weeks of “2-day” modified IF in patients with metabolic syndrome. The results of this study revealed that 8 weeks of “2-day” modified IF led to a significant reduction in fat mass, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and improved vasodilatory parameters. On the other hand, the results of this study showed that following the 8 weeks of “2-day” modified IF caused a significant change in the composition of the intestinal microbiome, increased the production of SCFA and decreased lipopolysaccharide levels (41).",90f9481a-7cec-4160-981d-09d8770242bb
28,results23,"  Conclusion  In this review study, we evaluated the effects of Ramadan and non-Ramadan IF on gut microbiome. The results of most animal and human studies indicate the positive effects of fasting on the composition and structure of the gut microbiome. In addition to the positive role of fasting on the composition and abundance of intestinal microbiome, in some studies, other positive results have been observed following the observance of fasting regimes. Positive alterations in gut microbiota, such as overexpression of A. muciniphila, B. fragilis, Bacteroides, and butyric acid-producing Lachnospiraceae, were found to be associated with improved health indicators and decreasing disease development during Ramadan fasting. However, factors such as the duration of fasting diets, the presence of chronic diseases and obesity can affect the results.",3ffb7ca0-2195-47c1-b1cb-c9c07353bcd8
29,results24," Considering the role of intestinal microbiome changes in the management of various diseases, future studies, especially clinical studies, should evaluate the impact of fasting regimes, especially Ramadan, on the management of various diseases through changes in the intestinal microbiome.
