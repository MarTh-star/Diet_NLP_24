Liquid loose bowl movements were reported by three participants in the HD treatment group and by one participant in the LD treatment group and are an expected side effect from bitter compound regulation of colonic anion secretion [55].  4. Discussion Traditional medicine records bitterness being used at times of food scarcity to reduce hunger and alleviate fast-related adverse effects [39,40], with recent research attributing this bioactivity to GI responses to bitterness [56].",e0c422b4-30a6-47e2-a05c-f0d691ece9a9
20,methods20," Until now, bitter appetite suppressants have been examined as an adjunct to meal consumption, to either stimulate satiation by reducing energy intake at an ad libitum meal or to extend satiety from a fixed energy meal [57,58]. This current study highlights for the first time that prolonged anorexigenic effects of GI-targeted bitter compounds may be independent of food intake, and demonstrates the capacity for non-nutritive appetite suppressant co-therapy to enhance satiety during fasting. The observed daily changes in several appetite measures are highly relevant, occurring over a greater than 6 h timeframe and being in excess of the 10 mm considered to be biologically important [59]. Changes in hunger and fullness of this magnitude, and over this time period, may be reasonably expected to affect eating behavior [50], and hence may aid in fast compliance.  The results obtained in this current study are consistent with those observed by Deloose et al.",1142b1fd-1cb2-41d4-9b7d-4987a59719ba
21,methods21," 2017 when examining the effect of the potently bitter synthetic chemical denatonium benzoate on postprandial appetite measures. Deloose et al. [41] showed that GI delivery of denatonium resulted in a 15–20 mm reduction in visual analogue scales (VAS) hunger ratings that persisted until their final time point 4 h post treatment. Here we report a similar magnitude change in hunger that persists for at least 4 h post treatment, although determining the exact duration of efficacy is difficult as a second treatment capsule was administered 4 h after the first. Combined, these results suggest that longer than 4 h of enhanced satiety may be possible from a single dose of a highly bitter gut-targeted appetite suppressant, and that even greater durations may be possible with repeat administration.  Appetite changes observed in the placebo group are generally in agreement with those of reported by Tinsley et al. 2018 [34] during their assessment through the same fasting period.",c862f164-7d10-4d98-bb18-e417da91e49c
22,methods22," As compared to Tinsley et al.’s results, the slightly decreased magnitude of changes in hunger and fullness reported here are likely because of the lower body mass index (BMI) range of participants in this current study (body mass index (BMI) 23.1 vs. 26.8 kg/m2). Although not assessed, the participants examined here would be expected to have low body fat, a characteristic that Tinsley et al. showed as a positive correlate for increased hunger during fasting. This current study also differed from Tinsley et al.’s research by prescribing a set fast commencement time, thus allowing for specific time of the day appetite assessments to be made. The reduction of lunchtime (12:00 h, t = 120 min) hunger observed here during Amarasate treatment has important implications for behavioral responses to fasting, with potential to improve both short term compliance and longer term adherence to the diet regime [60,61].",a53c4325-67bc-47d7-8c34-aeb97dc83de6
23,methods23," It is interesting that this 12:00 h time point exhibited the most pronounced change in daily hunger ratings, suggesting potential interactions between orexigenic meal time hunger signals and anorexigenic actions of the small intestinal targeted treatment [62,63]. Indeed, previous examinations of fasting show both spontaneous elevation of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin and increased visual analogue scales (VAS) ratings for hunger immediately prior to 12:00 h [49,64], and that small intestinal delivery of bitter compounds stimulates GI peptide hormones that antagonize the pro-appetite actions of ghrelin [65]. Confirmation of the physiology underlying meal time appetite suppression and how this may affect fasting compliance warrant further investigation.",ad66fee7-4a80-44da-90da-39a01e70ae05
24,methods24,"  The mechanisms through which Amarasate affects hunger and fullness are most likely associated with anorexigenic gut peptides glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), cholecystokinin (CCK), and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY)). These peptide hormones are released during intestinal exposure to bitterness, and increase meal initiated satiation and enhance postprandial satiety [42,44]. It is therefore possible that these same peptide hormones may be responsible for the reduced hunger observed during this fasting trial. Indeed, the administration of GI peptides has been shown to reduce hunger during the fasted state [57,66,67]. Exogenous administration of GLP-1 induces a 25 mm reduction in hunger scores for fasted humans [68], infusion of physiological concentrations of PPY reduce composite appetite scores by a similar magnitude [69], and CCK injection shows potent suppression of acute hunger (> 50 mm) when given to fasted people [70].",646f6303-f19a-42b5-bc08-8fcb88781fa5
25,methods25," These data suggest that the magnitude of hunger changes observed here could be explained by the actions of anorexigenic GI peptide secretion, and provides support for the conclusion that these hormones are likely mediators of the altered appetite ratings. However, as the relationship between anorexigenic gut peptides and appetite is complicated [71], we cannot preclude other mechanisms contributing to the observed effects, and it is possible that bitter compound regulation of intestinal motility and gastric accommodation may have contributed to the reported bioactivity [41,72].  Intermittent fasting is often associated with weight loss and hence is seen as an anti-obesity tool. However, fasting provides a series of health benefits that extend beyond reduction of body weight, including potential anti-aging effects and acute weight loss independent improvements in metabolic health [24,73].",c7caf1a6-de9c-4a1e-9d75-efe36ea3f7d9
26,methods26," It has been suggested that fasting related health benefits depend on metabolic switching that occurs 18–24 h into a water-only fast, highlighting that the fasting model tested may be appropriate to assess potential weight loss independent health benefits in this study’s population [74,75]. Given the positive result on appetite observed here, it may be prudent to assess metabolic switching as a surrogate marker for health during future fasting investigations. The role of IF for improved health rather than weight should not be overlooked, and may offer an avenue to affect meaningful health changes in a population that is typically not seen as requiring dietary intervention. Confirmation of the results observed here in overweight and obese individuals would be ideal, as this would allow the research to extend into the anti-obesity field.",df77fe1d-a688-4704-a19c-b74ade766f48
27,methods27," However, as fasting related hunger has been associated with body fat percentage [34], it may be advisable to examine shorter fasting periods when assessing appetite in this target population. Interestingly, cessation of prolonged fasting induces weight regain in overweight and obese individuals [76], further suggesting a potential role for anorexigenic agent co-therapy during intermittent fasting in this at-risk population.  The experimental design used in this study has several limitations that are worthy of discussion. Primarily, the decision to not strictly stipulate food consumption prior to and water consumption during the fasting period, and the differences in capsule weights that existed between the treatments.  The handling of water consumption and lead-in food intake during appetite trials is methodically problematic and no perfect solution exists. Indeed, the protocols on which this study’s design is based, Tinsley et al. 2018 [34] and Thivel et al.",aae2a35b-3593-46b4-8f20-96308417f2a5
28,methods28," 2018 [49], take different approaches to both pre-fasting food prescription and allocation of water for consumption, while both examining appetite during a 24 h water-only fast. We decided to adopt Thivel et al.’s approach of asking participants to consume their usual amount of energy content prior to fasting and allowing water intake without specifying restriction. This determination was in part due to how closely Thivel et al.’s protocol reflected real-world fasting applications, and in part due to safety concerns stemming from possible treatment induced intestinal water loss and reduction of gastric capacity [55,72]. We acknowledge that this decision may have introduced additional variation to the appetite measures examined. The potential for different capsule weights to bias results was considered during the study design, and reflects a limitation imposed by the properties of the extract tested.",8a083fa1-4493-4791-bbce-190f72618561
29,methods29," It was decided that variation in capsule weight was an acceptable tradeoff for maintaining consistent formulation and ensuring stability of treatments [47,48]. As treatment capsules were taken directly from an opaque cup and treatments were administered one week apart, we believe it is unlikely that differences in capsule weight were apparent to the participants, however, we cannot preclude the possibility of induced bias. Particular strengths of this study include the fixed day of the week and time of day fasting protocol, the conformation of test extract stability pre and post study, and the selection of laboratory conditions that closely resemble real-world fasting applications.  In summary, we determined the efficacy of a bitter extract to regulate appetite during the 16–24 h period of a water-only fast and showed that the GI targeted delivery of a highly bitter hops flower extract can reduce hunger and increase fullness during the late stages of the fast.",9b4b09a7-7541-4d09-b29a-4684c752a28e
30,methods30," The results of this study indicate a potential role for anorexigenic agent co-therapy during fasting, and suggest the need for further studies examining the use of anorexigenic agents in different fasting methods and in overweight populations. ",54ceacd1-7192-4927-971e-192885bf0f28
