0,introduction0,"Under unlimited access to food, all animals including humans tend to consume excess of food that is poorly controlled due to a natural instinct to accumulate fuel reserves for use in times of food scarcity (La Fleur et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2018). Particularly in our modern times, this can lead to overweight and obesity that can cause health problems such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases and shortening of life and health spans (Rusli et al., 2017; Friedman, 2018). Restriction of food consumption along with physical activity  are effective natural strategies known to date to cope with negative consequences of overfeeding, whereas pharmacological approach to decrease weight is likely accompanied by side effects.",943fae25-3a92-417e-85f9-091813a8de9a
1,introduction1," Food intake reduced relative to an ad libitum (AL) diet is called dietary restriction (DR) and was found to extend mean and maximum life span and health span in a variety of organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans, and is also beneficial in relieving diverse age-related pathologies . Such restriction has been found to decrease body mass and normalize blood glucose, insulin, and leptin levels in obese animals and humans helping at metabolic diseases including metabolic syndrome. In addition to effects on peripheral tissues, DR improves the operation of the central nervous system and weakens the symptoms of age-related neurodegenerative disorders in rodent models .  Two different approaches have been used to model DR in rodents . In the first approach, animals receive food daily but the amount of food is reduced by 30–40% compared to what could be consumed AL.",26e2ac6d-374b-41a8-98c0-311e5e5f290e
2,introduction2," In the second approach, called intermittent fasting, animals are provided with food for certain periods of time. In this mode, they are deprived of food for a full day, every other day, or 1 day in three but in between are fed AL. A third version of DR may place organisms on an intermittent fasting schedule, on feeding days they are not given food ad libitum, but receive lower amounts of food than the amount consumed on the AL regimen. Interestingly, although the first two approaches to DR mentioned above look different, they frequently result in similar changes in parameters such as body mass, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and levels of glucose and insulin (Le Couteur et al., 2016; Hao et al., 2018; Matyi et al., 2018).",004b3164-2f56-42af-9216-c66e0a409a5a
3,introduction3," Diverse molecular mechanisms are supposed to be responsible for the beneficial DR effects, including down-regulation of insulin signaling, activation of metabolic processes and biogenesis of mitochondria, a decrease in steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), and induction of cytoprotective stress responses (Gouspillou and Hepple, 2013; Pani, 2015). Intermittent fasting was also shown to promote mitohormesis, activate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and inhibit glycolysis (O’Neill and Hardie, 2013).  Whereas the mechanisms underlying malnutrition in the adult and aged population are being intensively investigated, little is known about the mechanisms underlying malnutrition in the adolescent and juvenile age. At the same time, according to the World Health Organization globally about 41 million children are overweight or obese whereas another 155 million are chronically undernourished (World Health Statistics, 2017).",efa8c44f-3a7d-4f48-a045-b8b5c3531866
4,introduction4," Therefore, there is a need for understanding (1) how the young organism reacts to food restriction and (2) whether this reaction might turn out to be beneficial for treating overweight and obesity during adolescence. Prolonged decrease in food supply may diminish energy production; therefore, we hypothesize that intermittent fasting may be not favorable for young mice, which need more energy resources for growth than adults do. Intermittent fasting may induce metabolic reorganization in young mice to ensure with energy resources the organs, whose functions cannot be slowed down. Thus, different tissues like cerebral cortex and liver may be affected differently by intermittent fasting, but sex difference at young age could be negligible.",b03c7f74-61ac-4881-bd2b-d3cbc2c98c1b
5,introduction5, To address these questions we chose every-other-day feeding (every other day feeding (EODF)) regimen for treatment of one-month-old mice as it does not require individual housing and enables littermates to stay as a group and measured glycolytic and mitochondrial potentials of the mouse cerebral cortex and the liver in animals of both sexes.  ,967d61e9-29a3-4f70-ad60-d4da3fcff99e

41,discussion0,"This work differs from previous studies in two major aspects: (1) the use of one-month-old mice, this age roughly corresponds to 8–9 years of human age (Flurkey et al., 2007; Dutta and Sengupta, 2016) and (2) analyses of animals of both sexes.  Body Mass and Food Consumption The age of animals at the end of our experiment (8 weeks) corresponded to approximately 16–18 years of human life span (Flurkey et al., 2007; Dutta and Sengupta, 2016). Therefore, the animals were still growing, increasing their body weight in both control and experimental groups. Since many processes in young organisms differ from ones in adults, it was interesting to investigate if every other day feeding (EODF) regimen had some specific effects in such young animals. Because ad libitum consumption of food must directly affect energy homeostasis, we asked whether every other day feeding (EODF) influenced the central energy-providing pathways of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation.",4cfd4e30-35f0-477e-991c-56a69a6f8d72
42,discussion1," Since brain and liver are among main organs responsible for regulation and coordination of organism’s energetic status, the present study was focused on them.  A seminal paper which described the effects of every other day feeding (EODF) on >200 phenotype parameters in >20 mouse tissues in young and aged animals was published recently by a large international team . Some of the parameters evaluated by this team were also of interest to us and provided data that either supports or complements the data in the present study. In the study of Xie et al. (2017) only males of C57BL/6 mouse strain were used and a slightly different from our experimental design was followed (i.e. two-month-old mice were subjected to either 1 or 19 months of every other day feeding (EODF)).",fa23bc00-3a84-4e27-bee0-7f4eaa0a580c
43,discussion2," The results showed that young every other day feeding (EODF) mice tended to weigh less with lower organ masses for brain and heart, and a trend (not statistically significant) of lighter liver mass than the control groups was found . every other day feeding (EODF) animals were also more active, consumed more oxygen and water, and produced more carbon dioxide and heat than controls. Fasted mice also showed a lower leucocyte count, but higher numbers of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit in blood. However, no differences in the levels of glucose, cholesterol, triacylglycerides, and activities of alkaline phosphatase (alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in plasma were found . In our previous work , where we used the same experimental design as in the current study, blood parameters were similar to those described in the above cited work .",d88efad5-4e40-4536-9902-07aad057d86f
44,discussion3," In particular, we found lower leucocyte counts, circulating glucose and lactate levels, no difference in the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or in hemoglobin levels or erythrocyte count, whereas Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was higher in males and lower in females of every other day feeding (EODF) group than that in AL groups . The difference between these two studies may be related to factors including: (1) mouse strain specificity, (2) different animal ages, or (3) experimental design. However, most of the differences between AL fed and every other day feeding (EODF) mice were generally similar between these two studies. With number of data showing similarity between this our work and that of Xie et al. (2017), one may suggest that rest parameters which were not measured in our work could be similar to those cited in the literature.",0b53be93-7d4c-4b18-ba5d-08af87adfaa1
45,discussion4," Therefore, we decided to investigate in details not only level of certain metabolites, but focused on activities of key glycolytic enzymes and mitochondria in cerebral cortex and liver in order to understand biochemical mechanisms underlying metabolic shifts at every other day feeding (EODF).  Tissue-Specific Response of Metabolic Fuels and Intermediates The only work analyzing the effect of every other day feeding (EODF) on some aspects of energy providing systems was carried out in rats . To obtain comparable data in mice, we have analyzed levels of main energetic substrates and metabolites, activities of key glycolytic enzymes, and the operation of mitochondria from cerebral cortex and liver of ad libitum and every other day feeding (EODF) young mice. Carbohydrate metabolism is usually seen as central in energy provision, especially for the brain.",cf20552c-d849-4ac2-aa3e-662abf6ce38c
46,discussion5," However, the brain is also known to use ketone bodies that were long believed to be synthesized in the liver, although it is suggested that astrocytes may also produce KB from fatty acids and transfer them to neurons (reviewed by Garaschuk et al., 2018). There is also some experimental evidence that astrocytes of Drosophila melanogaster can produce ketone bodies and provide them to neurons .  In the present study on adolescent mice, we found that under every other day feeding (EODF) the levels of glycolytic substrates, namely glucose and glycogen, in the liver (Figures 2A,B) were lower than in control in agreement with data obtained by Xie et al. in young adult mice .  Some clues as to glycolytic flux are also provided by changes in the levels of glycolytic intermediates such as pyruvate and lactate (Figure 3).",481d6cb1-deda-4197-9a13-1a56373388fc
47,discussion6," Whereas the concentrations of pyruvate were not changed by every other day feeding (EODF) both in the liver and cortex of males and females, every other day feeding (EODF) clearly decreased lactate concentrations in the liver of mice of both sexes (Figure 3C). Interestingly, in the cortex lactate level was not affected by every other day feeding (EODF) in males and even demonstrated a tendency to increase in females. One may interpret these data as a “feeding role” of the liver trying to provide the brain with glycolytic substrates and ketone bodies thus enabling its stable functioning. Brain is known to rely mainly on carbohydrates to meet energy demands (Jha and Morrison, 2018; Welcome and Mastorakis, 2018). Furthermore, the involvement of lactate in regulation of signaling pathways in the brain was recently described (Brooks, 2009; Jourdain et al., 2016, 2018; Dienel, 2017; Garaschuk et al., 2018).",5a39e3f7-5b7a-4c32-9f76-5ffa7a2ffef1
48,discussion7," Analysis of lactate/pyruvate ratio provides further clues to energetic cooperation between the brain and the liver (Table 1). In every other day feeding (EODF) mice of both sexes, this ratio was significantly lower in the liver. This may reflect a potential shift to provision of substrates for gluconeogenesis to enhance glucose availability for the brain. But in the cortex, the ratio was not affected in males, and in females it was even substantially increased. Therefore, the redistribution of glycolytic substrates and intermediates clearly supports a potential role of the liver in providing stable fuel and energy supply for the brain.  Additional clues toward energetic cooperation between the brain and the liver are provided by triacylglycerides and ketone bodies (Table 3 and Figure 5). The concentration of triacylglycerides (TAG) was not affected by the every other day feeding (EODF) regimen neither in the cortex, nor in the liver.",3f6ab6ad-bf9e-414f-bb0e-d8455f7cbca3
49,discussion8," Under conditions of limited access to food, maintenance of triacylglycerides (TAG) reserves looks a logical adaptation step because triacylglycerides (TAG) may serve as a precursor used for gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis (Rui, 2014; Grabacka et al., 2016). triacylglycerides (TAG)s may be included in gluconeogenesis via at least two related processes: glycerol part can be easily converted into glycolytic intermediates such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate, whereas fatty acids can be converted into acetyl-CoA, enter citric acid cycle at the stage of oxaloacetate, i.e. can also serve as a substrate for gluconeogenesis (Weinman et al., 1957; Glew, 2010; Kaleta et al., 2011, 2012). Importantly, ketogenesis during every other day feeding (EODF) can also be important in context of gluconeogenesis. Long chain fatty acids are used to produce KB, with building Concentrations of the ketone body (KB) β hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate being the main ones, with certain production of acetone.",73d81413-0d67-4070-9398-5e67279873b0
50,discussion9," Ketone bodies are produced mainly by the liver, especially under conditions of fasting regimens (Rui, 2014; Geisler et al., 2016), and are exported as fuel mainly to the brain. Stable triacylglycerides (TAG) levels in every other day feeding (EODF) mice, accompanied by an increase in liver ketogenesis, allow greater adaptability to intermittent food availability . A prominent role for building Concentrations of the ketone body (KB) β hydroxybutyrate (BHB) (the most abundant ketone) was well supported in the present study by direct measurement of building Concentrations of the ketone body (KB) β hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations in the liver and the cortex (Figures 5A,B).",53bda202-f984-44bb-b9e6-f11f67c05235
51,discussion10," Decreased building Concentrations of the ketone body (KB) β hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels in the liver and not changed or even higher in the brain of every other day feeding (EODF) animals may be explained by the fact that the enzyme succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase, needed for ketone body utilization, is not expressed in the liver but is expressed in the brain (Lukivskaya and Buko, 1993; Fukao et al., 1997; Orii et al., 2008). Due to this reason KB produced in the liver from carbohydrates and lipids are transported to other tissues particularly to the brain. Decreased activity of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, responsible for interconversion of building Concentrations of the ketone body (KB) β hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate in the liver, and enhanced or not changed levels of this enzyme in the cortex (Figure 6), may indicate importance of KB in energy provision in mice exposed to every other day feeding (EODF).",0e7e7335-a122-445a-8aa0-fd19327b558c
52,discussion11,"  Generally, the above data indicate that under every other day feeding (EODF) conditions tight cooperation in energy provision between the liver and the brain takes place and decreased activity of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase may support export of KB from liver with its utilization in the brain.  Selective Suppression of Key Glycolytic Enzyme Activities by Intermittent Fasting In most cases the activities of key glycolytic enzymes, namely HK, Phosphofructokinase (PFK), and PK, were mainly suppressed in the liver and the cerebral cortex of every other day feeding (EODF) mice (Figure 4). Interestingly, in the liver the activities of all these enzymes were lower in every other day feeding (EODF) mice relative to controls, and only in two cases, for HK and PK in males, these reductions were not significant.",9f0a363e-10b9-4504-ad02-084ad4b4a2af
53,discussion12," In the brain of both sexes, the activities of HK and PK behaved similarly to the responses seen in the liver – they were significantly lower in experimental compared to control animals. However, Phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity in the cortex behaved absolutely differently: it was higher in every other day feeding (EODF) compared to control males and not changed in females (Figure 4D). These data may reflect at least two things: (1) suppression of glycolysis in the liver and (2) potential partial suppression of glycolysis in the brain. With the liver the situation is largely clear: our results suggest a suppression of glycolysis along with an increase in gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis during every other day feeding (EODF). But the situation is more complicated with the brain, where the role of gluconeogenesis is not so well understood .",6a915c17-d3cd-4f4a-a57e-3898041702a1
54,discussion13," The stable or even enhanced Phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity in the cortex of every other day feeding (EODF) animals indicated a crucial role of this enzyme in brain energy provision in dietary restriction conditions. Although the activities of two other glycolytic enzymes, namely HK and PK, were lower in every other day feeding (EODF) mice cortex, Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is generally regarded as the rate-limiting enzyme in the regulation of glycolysis. Indeed, it is well known that net glycolytic flux is usually regulated by >95% at the Phosphofructokinase (PFK) locus, and only <5% by HK and PK (Moreno-Sánchez et al., 2008).  Which general picture arises from analysis of the measured enzyme activities? It is possible, that the every other day feeding (EODF) mouse tends to save resources and hence downregulates the activities of glycolytic enzymes in both the liver and the brain.",7b4ebe23-8202-49e3-99e0-b3d73433041a
55,discussion14," However, because catabolism of glucose is crucial for brain function, glycolytic flux in the brain should be affected minimally. This may be achieved by decreasing the activities of various glycolytic enzymes (e.g. HK and PK), but the activity of Phosphofructokinase (PFK), the crucial enzyme regulating net glycolytic flux, is maintained or even enhanced. Furthermore, brain energy metabolism can also be supported under fasting conditions by the oxidation of building Concentrations of the ketone body (KB) β hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate. A concerted operation of glycolysis and KB oxidation can provide efficient energy supply for brain function during intermittent fasting.  Operation of Mitochondria The every other day feeding (EODF)-mediated diminution in the capacities of RC complexes in the liver is in line with a decrease in other metabolic parameters, such as pyruvate and ketone bodies, substrates for mitochondrial respiration.",b5b85019-1865-45c8-8fd2-241791afabda
56,discussion15," Decreased capacities of RC complexes were observed earlier in liver mitochondria of fasting rats . However, a recent study showed the opposite – higher capacity of the RC for using different substrates . These discrepancies between different studies, including current one, might be explained by several reasons. Metabolism and, in particular, RC capacity is affected not only by food quantity, but also by the quality and balance between macronutrients (Solon-Biet et al., 2014). Such factors as circadian rhythm and microbiota may also impact metabolic effects of every other day feeding (EODF) and vice versa (Patterson and Sears, 2017). Fasting may also slow down metabolism which can be accompanied by a decrease in RC capacity (Brown and Staples, 2010).",46ff7eaa-02b1-4289-8b40-3256949f1f27
57,discussion16,"  The capacities of RC complexes might also depend on the balance between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, a subtype of autophagy involved in mitochondrial quality control (Stotland and Gottlieb, 2015). Fasting would expectedly stimulate autophagy via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (Guarente, 2008; Stotland and Gottlieb, 2015). Nevertheless, autophagy may confer opposite effects on mitochondria. Moderate mitophagy may improve the quality of the mitochondrial network via removing of damaged components. The latter could lead to increase in RC capacity (Guarente, 2008; Stotland and Gottlieb, 2015). However, extensive mitophagy may result in regulated metabolic rate depression such as in physiological states of torpor or hibernation (Storey, 2015; Salin et al., 2018).",e4d2c2c1-2eca-4e78-8659-53d8734052d7
58,discussion17,"  We also see that NADH- and tetramethyl p phenylenediamine (TMPD)-driven oxygen consumptions of liver mitochondria in our study were the most susceptible to every other day feeding (EODF) as compared to succinate-driven oxygen consumption. Of note, NADH- and tetramethyl p phenylenediamine (TMPD)-driven oxygen consumptions may also depend on the levels of metabolites provided with food such as flavin (for complex I) and heme (cytochrome c and complexes III, and IV). Also, we see that cortical mitochondria, unlike liver mitochondria, were not responsible to every other day feeding (EODF) in young mice. This may indicate that brain may have compensatory or protective mechanisms which allow keeping respiratory capacity of neural cells on sustainable level independently on food provision.  Conclusions and Perspectives Environmental challenges such as limited access to food require a coordinated metabolic response at organism’s level, i.e. cooperation between different organs.",b9fc483c-475a-4a3b-9dc3-ee432b4d28b0
59,discussion18," In this case, the brain-liver axis is crucial for the adequate organism’s response. In the present study we found that adolescent mice responded to regimen of intermittent fasting in a similar way as seen in adults and that the responses of males and females were generally similar. First of all, a slightly lower weight of experimental animals, which resulted from the reduced amount of food consumed, indicates that during growth stage general response to every other day feeding (EODF) is similar to one found in adult and old animals. Lower activities of key glycolytic enzymes and of mitochondrial respiration might lead to lower energy production. However, this suggestion contradicts data of Xie et al. (2017) who found that mice subjected to every other day feeding (EODF) consumed more oxygen than the AL fed ones, but this idea has to be tested experimentally.",c25b95e4-2260-4af8-9930-ebf613cfe782
60,discussion19,"  At feeding day certain portion of glucose and lipids is used to meet organisms’ demand in energy and other resources, whereas excessive food consumed is accumulated in the liver in triacylglycerides (TAG) and glycogen forms. At starvation day, these resources are mobilized. Interestingly, since at starvation production of very-low-density lipoprotein (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)) in liver is lowered, its capability to export triacylglycerides is decreased. Due to this triacylglycerides (TAG)s are converted to KB. Because liver does not express key KB catabolizing enzyme succinyl-coenzyme A (CoA):3-ketoacid CoA transferase, formed ketone bodies are exported from the liver to be used in the brain. Periodic repetition of feeding/starving cycles induces adaptive responses in mice directed to economic utilization of accumulated energy resources during starvation.",02629f41-1ae9-4900-837e-e089f6deb459
61,discussion20,"  Further research should be directed toward elucidation of the long term consequences (such as on life span and health span) of early life every other day feeding (EODF). It would be also interesting to evaluate whether the lower activities of glycolytic enzymes and mitochondrial oxygen consumption conferred by every other day feeding (EODF) would influence lifelong stress resistance or the efficiency of reproduction and offspring quality. Identification of mechanisms involved would shed light on potential targets providing deleterious vs. beneficial effects of every other day feeding (EODF) at early life stages, particularly related to metabolic syndrome and may be under starvation. That is important because in developed countries substantial amount of children are overweighted, whereas in developing countries many children may suffer undernutrition.",ef9f5f0c-fe0f-49ce-ab29-12f78ed2eae6
