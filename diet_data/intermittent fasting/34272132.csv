0,results0," Time Distribution  The number of articles published each year reflects the activity of the field and the importance given to a particular research area (39). The annual distribution of the literature on intermittent fasting over the past 20 years was obtained by counting the volume of literature on intermittent fasting during the period 2000–2020 (Figure 2). It shows that the overall trend of intermittent fasting-related literature is increasing year by year, indicating that scholars are gradually paying more attention to the field of intermittent fasting.  Figure 2 Trends in publications in the field of intermittent fasting from 2000 to 2020.  As can be seen from Figure 2, the development of intermittent fasting over the past two decades can be divided into two phases: phase 1 is a steady growth phase (2000–2016) with an annual average volume of 25 articles. Caloric restriction has been shown to have many benefits for the body since as early as 1935 (40).",dec22422-6252-46ea-b592-dfbd3a9b0cbf
1,results1," After 2000, a new dietary strategy, intermittent fasting, has been studied and proven to have beneficial effects on health (41, 42). The literature on intermittent fasting in this phase shows a steady increase.  Phase 2 is a period of sustained growth (2017–2020), with an average of 167 publications per year, which is at a high level, indicating the rising research fervor and importance of intermittent fasting. The number of publications exceeds 100 for the first time in 2017 and reaches a 20-year peak in 2020. Mattson's 2017 review of the effects of intermittent fasting on health and disease processes has attracted widespread scholarly attention and driven the rapid development of intermittent fasting (24). Intermittent fasting has become a popular dietary strategy. As people become more concerned about their health and quality of life, diet is a key part of health promotion to drive the development of diet and health-related research (43).",388f0dda-e6ee-4eae-8792-1e1243ee8804
2,results2," Research related to intermittent fasting will continue to receive extensive attention from scholars, and research in this area will be progressively deepened.  Spatial Distribution  Country Distribution  The parameter “Country” was selected in CiteSpace and a knowledge map of the national/regional cooperation networks in the field of intermittent fasting was obtained (Figure 3). Each node represents a country (region), and the size of the node is proportional to the number of articles published; the lines connecting the nodes represent the connections between them, and the thickness of the lines is proportional to the closeness of their connections; the outermost circle represents centrality, which is a measure of the size of the connections in the knowledge graph network, and is the hub of communication with other literature nodes (44).

Table 1 presents the top 10 countries (regions) in the field of intermittent fasting research according to the number of publications. The United States is the center of global cooperation in this field and cooperates most closely with other countries and regions due to the highest publications (424 articles, accounting for 38.34% of the literature sample).",70e29f16-f377-4cde-bff4-558c16363e85
4,results4," According to the theory of the Yuasa phenomenon (45), the country whose research results account for more than 25% of the total number of scientific results at a given time can be called the world center of science for that period, the United States, as the leading country in intermittent fasting research, has published more than a quarter of the total number of articles and is the world scientific center in the field of intermittent fasting. China (70), England (70), Australia (67) and Germany (55) followed closely in terms of volume. When analyzing in terms of centrality, the USA (0.49) was ranked first, followed by the European countries of Australia (0.15), Germany (0.13), Italy (0.12) and England (0.12). The high-centeredness country has an important place in the study of intermittent fasting, and it is worth noting that countries such as Italy, Germany and Australia, although the volume of articles is small, but the impact is large.",88dd9276-3896-4f72-825e-c607df267176
5,results5,"  European and American countries have a high influence in this field, compared with China's 2nd place in the number of articles and 0.04 centrality, indicating that although China's ranking in the number of articles is at the top, it is less connected in the network map and has a lower influence. Therefore, increasing the depth of intermittent fasting research, accelerating multidisciplinary and multi-disciplinary cooperation, and enhancing the innovative thinking and international exchange ability of researchers are effective ways to improve research of intermittent fasting in China.

8,results8," Knowledge mapping of disciplines may provide a first glimpse into the broad international classification of intermittent fasting in terms of disciplines. The order based on the frequency of discipline source are as follows: nutrition (262 times, centrality 0.14), endocrinology (184 times, centrality 0.08), cell biology (139 times, centrality 0.21), neurology (112 times, centrality 0.4), molecular biology (102 times, centrality 0.65), and sports science (67 times, centrality 0). The distribution of disciplines shows that intermittent fasting is a multidisciplinary field of study, combining the characteristics of multiple disciplines such as nutrition, biology and sports. At the same time, there has been a major trend toward the use of multidisciplinary cross-sectional trials for the study of intermittent fasting, which has also promoted further developments in this area.

As can be seen in Figure 6, the authorship of intermittent fasting research is relatively stable, with author groups usually containing two or more core authors. The field of intermittent fasting has formed a core group of academic teams such as VARADY and MATTSON respectively. Table 3 presents the top 10 authors in terms of the number of publications. Professor Varady has published 48 publications, ranking first and second in total citations (2,699), and his study included in Cell Metabolism in 2020 compared the effects of two popular forms of Time restricted feeding (TRF) (4 and 6 h) on weight and cardio metabolic risk factors and found restricted feeding promises to be an effective weight loss intervention (48).",e3e3d716-4961-4c8a-975f-bc99f9f49724

Journal Distribution  Analyzing the source journals of a certain research field can help researchers grasp the core journals of this field accurately and provide reliable reference sources for further research in this field (50). Table 4 shows the 10 journals with the most published articles. Among them, NUTRIENTS, PLOS ONE, CELL METAB, NUTRITION and ENDOCRINOLOGY are the top five journals.

12,results13," The size of the nodes is closely related to the frequency of citations, and the thickness of the line between the nodes indicates the closeness of the connection. As seen in Figure 7, Sutton et al. (15) had the largest literature node with 87 citations, ranking first. The researcher conducted a clinical trial of early time restricted feeding (e-Time restricted feeding (TRF)) on eight pre-diabetic men; the study found that when taking the same food intake as the control group, subjects did not lose weight but improved insulin levels, insulin sensitivity, suggesting that the benefits of time restricted feeding were not related to food intake and weight loss. The second most cited literature is the article published by Mattson et al.",d7e520bd-5ab9-4000-98e9-1e4540a29677
13,results14," (24); this study provides a systematic review of the literature on fasting and indicates that time restricted feeding therapy has a positive impact on health indicators in both animals and humans, as well as improving many health indicators in healthy individuals and those with certain chronic conditions; in the meantime, this publication has been accepted for publication. The third cited literature is the article by Trepanowski et al. with a total of 79 citations (42), which stated that alternate-day fasting did not produce better results when compared to daily calorie restriction trials. Also, this trial was the longest lasting and largest trial. All three papers were published in the same phase and had high co-citation frequency, but the research perspectives were quite different, which reflects the different opinions of intermittent fasting. Therefore, IF field is still evolving.  Figure 7 Co-citation analysis mapping of literature related to intermittent fasting.",053ae8a7-e635-44b2-98a6-afb5440f2d0c

References with high intensity values in the intensity column are often important milestones in scientific mapping research (52). Thus, the focus of the intermittent fasting research field can be found. The top 12 literature with the highest citation intensity from 2000 to 2020 are listed in Figure 8, highlighting the direction of focus and research trends in intermittent fasting over the last 20 years. Of these 12 articles, seven were clinical studies, three animal studies, and two reviews, most of which were RCT studies.

17,results18,"  Since 2004, the field has focused mainly on caloric restriction research. Anson et al. (41) compared intermittent fasting with a caloric restriction protocol and found that intermittent fasting produced health benefits that outweighed caloric restriction. Subjects often spontaneously tend to eat less globally as there were fewer food opportunities. But a study found that intermittent fasting also had beneficial effects on glucose regulation and resistance to neuronal damage in mice, and these benefits were independent of calorie intake.  The trend in intermittent fasting research after 2013 shifted to studies of alternate day fasting. Varady et al. (53) conducted studies on humans and found that alternate-day fasting had a weight loss and cardioprotective effect in normal weight people, and that dietary adherence was high in this trial. Bhutani et al.",79643a07-1c6f-44be-b88f-ff76ac80cf31
18,results19," (17) compared Alternate day fasting (ADF) combined with endurance training with Alternate day fasting (ADF) alone, an exercise intervention, and found that Alternate day fasting (ADF) combined with endurance training produced better changes in body weight, body composition and lipid indicators of coronary heart disease risk. Although Alternate day fasting (ADF) combined with a low-fat diet can be effective for weight loss and cardio protection. Given that most Americans consume a high-fat (HF) diet, Klempel et al. (47) explored the physical effects of consuming a high-fat diet during Alternate day fasting (ADF) and found that Alternate day fasting (ADF), even in a high-fat setting, can also help obese people to lose weight and reduce the risk factors for coronary heart disease.",db8796a3-1da4-4877-b2f8-adff011fc705
19,results20,"  After 2018, intermittent fasting studies focused on Alternate day fasting (ADF) and Time restricted feeding (TRF) studies, which focused more on safety studies of fasting and more flexible forms of fasting, while, at the same time, began to experiment with studies in various populations. Longo et al. (12) noted that PF, Time restricted feeding (TRF) and IF have profound beneficial effects on rodent and human health. In rodents, intermittent or periodic fasting prevents diabetes, cancer, heart disease and neurodegeneration (41). In human studies, intermittent fasting has helped with obesity, hypertension, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Incorporating an IF or PF lifestyle into adult life has great potential to promote optimal health and reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, especially for those who are overweight and sedentary.

20,results21," (24) reviewed the effects of intermittent fasting on health and disease processes and also confirmed the many benefits of intermittent fasting. Catenacci et al. (54) point out that alternate day eating is safe and tolerable and is a reasonable alternative dietary strategy for the treatment of obesity. However, Trepanowski et al. (42) compared alternate-day fasting with daily calorie-restricted diets and found that alternate-day fasting was not superior to daily calorie-restricted diets in terms of compliance, weight loss, weight maintenance or improvements in cardiovascular disease risk indicators. Chaix et al. (1) concluded that Time restricted feeding (TRF) has great potential in combating obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.",b7b05cfc-0a4e-4d69-9262-1d064afc6591
21,results22," Although Time restricted feeding (TRF) emphasizes the benefits of daily fasting cycles, the 5T2A approach (5 days of Time restricted feeding (TRF) combined with a two-day casual diet at weekends) is equally effective and the food intake of 5T2A is almost identical to that of the cycle, suggesting that Time restricted feeding (TRF) diets can resist occasional changes in eating patterns. That is, even occasional shifts in dietary patterns do not diminish the benefits of Time restricted feeding (TRF). However, when mice transiting from Time restricted feeding (TRF) to free-feeding mode, the benefits of Time restricted feeding (TRF) were gradually diminished. Conversely, mice with gradual transition from free-feeding to a time restricted feeding pattern can effectively alleviate the adverse health conditions associated with obesity.",4ba245f2-04b9-4f29-ac9f-5a30f1e9ed8d
22,results23," The results of this study suggest that Time restricted feeding (TRF) interventions have a positive effect on bodybuilder performance and athletes can adopt this diet during the maintenance phase of training, which facilitates the reduction of fat mass while maintaining muscle mass (55).  The focus of research in this area over the last 20 years is roughly divided into three phases in terms of the 12 most highly cited papers: Phase 1 (2004–2008), which focused on the study of caloric restriction for human health. In the second phase (2013–2017), the trend in intermittent fasting research shifted to research on alternate-day fasting. In the third phase (2018–2020), the focus in this period was on alternate-day fasting and time restricted feeding, but the difference is that the research in this period went deeper and began to compare the compliance, safety and health benefits of dietary practices, thus exploring a better way of eating to serve the health of diverse populations.",a4d2bb7d-10bb-4790-bcac-420ae669e76b
23,results24,"  Frontiers of Research  The timeline view focuses on reflecting the relationships between clusters and the historical span of the literature in a given cluster, and also reflects the timing of distribution and connection of key keywords between clusters (56, 57). Figure 9 shows the timeline mapping of keywords in the field of intermittent fasting research from 2000–2020. The key parameters of clustering are Modularity Q value of 0.6,512 > 0.3 and S-value of 0.5,675 > 0.5, which can indicate the formation of reasonable clusters (58). The figure shows that time restricted feeding has been active since 2000 and is closely linked to other clusters and is at the forefront of research in this area. Time restricted feeding is a non-pharmacological technique for obesity and related diseases (2), which has been shown to have a significant effect on improved quality of life (59). Time restricted feeding is mainly used to achieve weight loss by reducing appetite (60).",7a3d4036-ad41-412b-9ad4-a7e5b670529e
24,results25," Besides preventing obesity and improving metabolic disease (61–65), time restricted feeding can improve blood sugar, lipid metabolism, and chronic diseases (49, 66–68). It is worth noting that in the restricted eating state, the benefits of 2 days of random eating in a week in subjects are also beneficial to the organism (2), and time restricted eating is beneficial to human health even in the absence of weight loss (69).  Figure 9 Time-line mapping of keywords in the field of intermittent fasting research 2000-2020.  Conclusions  On the basis of 11,066 intermittent fasting studies from WOS from 2000 to 2020, CiteSpace was utilized to visually analyze the volume of articles published, distribution characteristics (country/region, institution), collaborations (country/region, institution, author), literature co-citations, and the frontiers of intermittent fasting research and trends.",5542a300-3aeb-4d40-9b79-f5ffc54cdc1b
25,results26," The main findings of this study are as follows:  Firstly, the number of articles in the field of intermittent fasting is increasing year by year. From the graph of the temporal distribution, intermittent fasting studies can be divided into two phases: phase 1 is the steady growth phase (2000–2016), during this period, the number of publications is slowly increasing; phase 2 is the continuous growth phase (2017–2020), in which there was a surge in the number of publications with an average of 167 publications per year, indicating the popularity and importance of intermittent fasting. This trend is also supported by the extensive literature on intermittent fasting since 2021.  Secondly, the United States has significantly higher publication volume and more influence than other countries, and maintains close cooperation with other countries and regions, indicating that the United States plays an important role in IF field.",d46f9c9e-00a5-4257-bab5-50b54e354ba4
26,results27," Although China ranks 2nd in the number of publications, however, the level of academic collaboration in this field is much lower than that of other countries; therefore, cooperation between international institutions needs to be strengthened.  Thirdly, intermittent fasting is typically an interdisciplinary study, numerous disciplinary categories are involved, mainly covering the disciplines of nutrition, biology and kinesiology. Most of the scholars who have participated and made outstanding contributions to intermittent fasting research have a medical background. For example, the representative American scholar Professor Mattson is at the National Institutes of Health. However, there is no shortage of scholars with a sports background, such as Professor Varady, a faculty member in the Department of Exercise and Nutrition at the University of Illinois, who is the most published scholar in the field of intermittent fasting and has made outstanding contributions to this field.",28b3bb17-459c-41f1-a96e-80a28308f504
27,results28,"  Fourthly, intermittent fasting has a variety of modalities and the impact of applying this dietary strategy has been inconsistent. Intermittent fasting has received considerable attention in the past few years, but its safety and compliance has been questioned (70, 71). However, the use of intermittent fasting in China has been viewed with caution. Most of the studies on intermittent fasting in China are literature reviews and animal studies.  Fifthly, the focus of intermittent fasting research has gone through three phases over the past two decades: caloric restriction, alternate-day eating, and time restricted eating. Time-restricted eating has been active for two decades and is the focus of current research in this field, which is strongly linked to the promotion of physical health.  In 2020, Professor Wilkinson found that TRE interventions, which do not require attempts to change physical activity or diet, can also have a positive effect on the treatment of metabolic syndrome (3).",f86845f0-abd8-4af6-996b-72c4c1c10676
28,results29," Professor Ulgherait in the journal NATURE in 2021. It suggests that Time restricted feeding (TRF) may have benefits in delaying aging and prolonging life (72). A 2022 study by Professor Mao YL showed that Time restricted feeding (TRF) not only improves fasting blood glucose and inflammation, but also increases intestinal microbial diversity (73) and be expected to become health-promoting lifestyle (48). The above studies suggest that the culmination of research on time restricted eating in intermittent fasting is imminent.  The field of intermittent fasting research has achieved a rapid growth over the past 20 years, and the growing literature on intermittent fasting each year indicates that the field has become a research hotspot in recent years. The interdisciplinary research context of intermittent fasting will facilitate international cooperation among scholars to find more scientific, non-pharmacological techniques.",b1cbf6aa-dd11-4bc0-a0bb-ede37630d8f0
