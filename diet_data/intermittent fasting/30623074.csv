0,introduction0,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is on the rise worldwide1, and cognitive decline is a severe complication of T2D2,3. The etiology of cognitive impairments resulting from diabetes is multifactorial, including brain insulin resistance, cerebral microvascular damage, and neuroinflammation2,4. Previous research has found that T2D-associated or high-fat-diet-induced cognitive deficits are connected to brain insulin resistance, glucose uptake decrease, neurotransmitter metabolism disturbance, and mitochondrial dysfunction5,6.  Recent studies have emphasized the critical impact of gut microbiota on regulating systemic insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism via the generation of functional microbial metabolites in diabetic rodent models and humans7,8. Moreover, gut microbiota plays a vital role in linking diet and host physiology and pathology.",20130be7-7d44-400f-b157-55acc019ee3b
1,introduction1," Microbiota homeostasis is essential for the maintenance of gut health and for modulating cognitive functions via the regulation of the permeability of the blood–brain barrier, brain energy homeostasis, and synaptic transmission9–11. It is noteworthy that interindividual variation of microbiota composition and microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 3-indolepropionic acid (indolepropionic acid (IPA)), secondary bile acids (BAs), and serotonin (5-HT), are critically driven by the genotype, age, and dietary patterns of the host10,12. They are also strongly linked to whole body metabolism and function particularly, and have been shown to have potential neuroprotective effects. BAs such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUdeoxycholic acid (DCA)) has been suggested as a potential agent in preventing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer’s diseases (AD)13,14.",8ac4039d-ae32-499b-ae0f-de09aec89696
2,introduction2," In addition, previous research demonstrated that indolepropionic acid (IPA), one of the microbial deamination metabolites of tryptophan, might possess potential neuroprotective against β-amyloid-induced neuronal damage via scavenging free radicals15.  Dietary restrictions have been well reported to be beneficial in the context of metabolic syndrome and the lengthening of lifespans, and gut microbiota may play a pivotal role in this16. Intermittent fasting (IF) regimens represent a periodic dietary restriction, which have shown to increase lifespan, promote energy metabolism, and to reduce the risk of developing various age-related pathologies17–19. It has been suggested that IF could ameliorate insulin resistance, activate adipose tissue browning, protect central nervous system autoimmunity, and improve diabetes-related retinopathy in rodent models, via modulation of the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites compositions20–22.",afa4ee38-e1fc-4aa3-8d02-5a3c7eb179e1
3,introduction3," Moreover, IF designed as alternate-day fasting has shown to improve age-related and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated neuroinflammation, brain structure, and cognitive functions in animal models23–26. Nonetheless, the protective effects of IF on the cognitive deficits associated with diabetes remain unclear, and to what extent the gut microbiota affect brain function is largely underexplored.  Given emerging reports that link gut microbiota to brain function and metabolism in relation to IF and health status, we undertook a comprehensive study to examine the impact of IF on diabetes-driven cognitive impairment and underlying mechanisms in db/db mice, a typical T2D rodent model, using a multi-OMICS analysis of the gut microbiota, plasma metabolome, and brain transcriptome combined with conventional behavioral tests.",2a408961-d53e-48e2-982e-9be189ac4f5b
4,introduction4," To determine the role of gut microbiota in mediating the protective effects of IF on cognitive deficiency, we also examined behavioral alterations in diabetic mice in which the gut microbiota was removed by antibiotics treatment. Our findings suggest that gut microbiota/metabolites mediate the neuroprotective actions of IF on diabetes, thus highlighting the potential of modulating the gut microbiota as an effective intervention for metabolism-implicated neurodegenerative diseases.

The 16S rRNA copies in the feces of the animals after antibiotics treatment were detected with qPCR (Fig. 6b), as previous described57. All the behavior studies and biochemical samples were collected/detected on the fasting day of IF regimen. One mouse in the db/db group was drowned during the water-maze test, and relevant data after that were excluded. For plasma metabolomics, two samples were excluded due to the poor quality of measurements.

The mice in other groups were injected with same volume saline. For the SCFAs group, the SCFAs (acetate 67.5 mM, propionate 40 mM, butyric acid 25 mM) were dissolved in the drinking water of the mice. The mice were treated for 14 days. The treatment was also performed during the behavioral tests.  After IF regimen, the antibiotics treatment, and metabolites treatment, the cognitive behavioral assessment was determined with a water-maze test. After behavioral tests, mice were killed, then the serum and tissues samples were collected by either snap-frozen by liquid nitrogen and store at −80 °C or directly stored in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analysis.",436d35e2-1aaf-4d78-9f42-32adf1891b6c

The HOMA-IR values, which reflected insulin resistance, were lowered after IF treatment in db/db mice (Fig. 1h). Furthermore, IF significantly reduced the mass of epididymal white adipose tissues (eWAT) and the size of adipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1B–D) (ANOVA with Tukey’s test, p < 0.01). Morris water-maze tests were performed to assess the effects of IF on the cognitive impairment inherent in the diabetic mice. IF decreased escape latency in the 5-day navigation test, indicating that the improved cognitive deficits of db/db mice (Fig. 1i; Supplementary Fig. 1E).

Insulin signaling was assessed in the hippocampus in order to evaluate whether IF could ameliorate brain insulin resistance. IF increased the IRS1- Tyr896/IRS1 and Akt phosphorylation, indicating that it stimulated the hippocampal insulin signaling pathway (Fig. 2d). We also observed that IF treatment enhanced the expression of BDNF, a neurotrophic factor involved in maintaining neuronal survival and synaptic function, and the phosphorylation of ERK/CREB, an upstream signaling of BDNF synthesis, compared with db/db mice (Fig.",5f6a3caf-8631-4c5e-b83c-761c4764e689

It is also worth noting that NFκB, a major transcriptional factor mediating inflammation27, was activated in the hippocampus of diabetic mice (Supplementary Fig. 2). IF treatment suppressed NFκB activation and downregulated the phosphorylation of JNK/p38 and protein expressions of Iba-1, a well-known marker of microglial activation (Supplementary Fig. 2).

To identify the biological networks affected by IF regimens, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (weighted gene co expression network analysis (WGCNA)) using all 27,094 genes in 31 samples, and 5 modules were identified that contained functionally and biologically linked genes (Supplementary Fig. 3C). Of note, the “MEbrown” module was highly positively correlated with the IF regimen (r = 0.892, p = 2e-11) (Supplementary Fig. 3D), which consisted of 1044 genes (88.40%) identified using differentially expressed gene (DEG) (Supplementary Fig. 3E). We identified 49 hub genes (false discovery rate (FDR)-p < 0.01) with high inter-connectivity and intra-connectivity in the module (Supplementary Fig. 3E).

Consistent with the results from the RNA-sequencing analysis, the qPCR analysis confirmed that the mitochondrial and metabolic genes expressed were upregulated by IF in db/db mice (Supplementary Fig. 3F). As an indicator of mitochondrial biogenesis, the mtDNA/nDNA ratio in the hippocampus was increased by IF in db/db mice (Fig. 3g) (ANOVA with Tukey’s test, p < 0.01), suggesting that the upregulated mitochondrial genes were likely a consequence of increased mitochondria mass.  We then sought to examine PGC1α and AMPK/mTOR protein expression to uncover the potential underlying mechanism of upregulating mitochondrial biogenesis in the db/db-IF group (Fig. 3e). IF led to a significant increase in the protein expression of PGC1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis; this established a strong correlation with mitochondrial-related gene upregulation (Supplementary Fig. 3F).",28ba7a55-4d21-4ba0-a8b4-1eed37365d1d

IF-restructured gut microbiota and microbial metabolites The integrity of the gut barrier is critical to maintaining gut permeability and preventing endotoxemia, and is also related to diabetes and its complications21. It has also been reported that increased endotoxemia from increased gut permeability can increase inflammation, which triggers impaired glucose tolerance29. We thus investigated the effects of IF on gut barrier integrity, by assessing the villi length, the thickness of the muscularis, and the numbers of goblet cells.",d94bae6f-0a00-4c3b-bb70-8e5d76670a71
43,results13," The results showed that IF increased the villi length and the muscularis thickness in diabetic mice, but had no influence on the numbers of goblet cell (Supplementary Fig. 4A–D). Moreover, the permeability of the colon was assessed with a use of Ussing Chamber, and we observed that IF prevented gut leakage accompanied with a decline in plasma LPS levels (Supplementary Fig. 4G, H) (ANOVA with Tukey’s test, p < 0.01). The expression of claudin-1, a tight-junction protein in gut barrier30, was also elevated in db/db-IF colon tissue (Supplementary Fig. 4A, E, F), in line with the intestinal permeability alteration.  Gut microbiota composition was determined from fecal samples of the respective mice on day 0 (baseline level) and day 28 using bacterial 16S rRNA gene v3–v4 amplicon sequencing. Specifically, the microbiome alpha diversity significantly increased after a 28-day IF treatment even though the total number of OTUs remained at the same level initially (Fig.",93f4a873-fa23-483b-8256-2b02918ced14

Considering time as a background effect, different diets and murine genotype were major factors in the shaping of gut microbiome and explained 5.9% and 7.7% of the total variance, respectively (Fig. 4c). IF treatment did not totally overturn the influence of diabetes with decreased relative abundance of Allobaculum and Bifidobacterium in both db/db mice (Fig. 4d).

62,results32,"    In addition, compared with the db/db-IF group, we found that the removal of gut microbiota by the antibiotics treatment significantly reduced plasma indolepropionic acid (IPA) and fecal SCFAs in db/db mice (Supplementary Fig. 9, Supplementary Data 10) (ANOVA with Tukey’s test, p < 0.01).  Microbial metabolites improved the cognitive function An additional animal study was conducted to investigate the role of IF-regulated microbial metabolites, in particular, indolepropionic acid (IPA) and SCFAs that were reduced in the antibiotics-treated group, in improving cognitive deficits. Besides, the effects of peripheral 5-HT and TUdeoxycholic acid (DCA) on cognitive function were also examined, since these metabolites were elevated in the IF group in this study (Fig. 4g). Previous studies have also reported the potential of their neuroprotective effects13,14,36. Administration of all these metabolites individually improved cognitive function and insulin sensitivity in db/db mice (Fig.",15b1014a-280a-41cb-865d-c298a2b32108
63,results33," 6g; Supplementary Fig. 10C–H) (ANOVA with Tukey’s test, p < 0.05). Consistent with the beneficial effects of IF treatment, administration of these metabolites also enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and protected the ultrastructure of synapses (Fig. 6h–j). Moreover, treatment of TUdeoxycholic acid (DCA) but not other tested metabolites suppressed the bodyweight gain in db/db mice (Fig. 6f). Besides, all the metabolites treatment had no influence on food intake and water intake of the db/db mice (Supplementary Fig. 10A, B). Although the dosage of the metabolites treatment was higher than that in IF regimen group mice, these results partly evaluate the causation and the roles of these metabolites in during IF regimen.

64,discussion0,"A number of studies has shown beneficial effects of IF on diabetes and its complications through the restructuring of gut microbiota20,21. However, whether IF could alleviate diabetes-related cognitive deficits and the role played by gut microbiota is still unclear, highlighting an urgent need to investigate the mechanisms underlying how IF improves cognitive function. This study has demonstrated for the first time that a 28-day IF treatment alleviated diabetes-induced cognitive impairment via a microbiota–metabolites–brain axis, benefiting from comprehensive investigations on diabetic mice behavior/synaptic structure, mitochondrial/energy metabolism-related signaling, and an integrated analysis of multi-OMICs.  IF improved cognitive function and spatial memory in diabetic mice as evidenced from a Morris water-maze test, a de-facto standard and valid cognitive assessment37,38.",170b4de8-bf84-4a5e-97b4-5d48cd923357
65,discussion1," Our previous study found that the impairment of brain insulin signaling led to glucose hypometabolism, disturbed tricarboxylic acid (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle, as well as altered neurotransmitter levels and a decline in long-term potentiation (LTP)39. This finding provided an essential link between brain energy metabolism and cognitive function. Here, we found that IF stimulated IRS1/Akt signaling and its related ERK/CREB/BDNF neurotrophic signaling, and IF inhibited the NFκB/JNK inflammatory pathways (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 2). Consistently, the increase of postsynaptic protein postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 and the improvement of the ultrastructure of synapses in the hippocampus further demonstrated the benefits of an IF regimen on synaptic function. Further research is needed to determine the effects of IF on neuronal glucose uptake/metabolism and synaptic transmission in diabetic models via PET/CT/NMR and LTP assay measurements, respectively.",1899f67d-c34a-411c-bc73-9b6835f62de5
66,discussion2,"  An integrated analysis of multi-OMICs data revealed strong links between the alterations of microbial metabolites in circulation and the IF-induced changes of the microbiome profile and hippocampus mitochondrial and energy metabolism-related gene expression. These findings suggest the beneficial effects of 28-day IF on diabetes-induced cognitive functions via the gut–metabolism–brain axis (Fig. 5), which to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported before.  Herein, we observed that a 28-day IF regimen improved gut barrier integrity and decreased plasma LPS level, which could partly explain how IF reduces neuroinflammatory responses. IF also altered microbiome diversity in diabetic mice, accompanied with altered bacteria abundance, enhancing the abundance of Lactobacillus (Fig. 4). The effect of IF on gut microbiota has been well reported20–22.",4166abd4-9760-4db4-807f-4e2511cfb454
67,discussion3," However, the restructuring effect of IF on gut microbiota may be different, due to the variance in animal strains, housing condition, baseline microbiota profiles, and feeding periods. Li et al. reported that an every-other-day fasting regimen increased the OTU abundance of Firmicutes, and at the same time decreased the majority of other phyla in the fecal contents of male C57BL/6N mice20. IF also enriched Lactobacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Prevotellaceae families in the stool samples of female C57BL/6J fed every other day22. Intriguingly, a recent study of IF on db/db mice fecal microbiota composition found that a 7-month IF regimen led to the enrichment in Lactobacillus and the reduction of Akkermansia21, which is consistent with our findings.  The IF-restructured gut microbiota led to alterations in the microbial metabolites in plasma, which might further explain how IF alleviates cognitive impairment in diabetic mice.",02caef6c-52bd-429d-b691-bd4e03e65723
68,discussion4," The PICRUSt analysis found that the several microbes-related metabolism pathways including primary/secondary bile acid biosythesis were altered after IF regimen (Fig. 4f). However, PICRUSt has its autologous defects on account of the availability of appropriate reference genomes and undetectable resolution of 16S rRNA sequences on strain variation. In this study, using metabolome analysis, we found that IF increased plasma levels of BAs including CA, TUdeoxycholic acid (DCA), muricholic acid (MCA), and deoxycholic acid (DCA), and these BAs were correlated with IF affected gut microbiome and transcriptome in the hippocampus. Moreover, administration of TUdeoxycholic acid (DCA) also improved the cognitive impairment in db/db mice (Fig. 6). These findings suggest BAs play a role in microbiota–metabolites–brain axis in relation to cognitive impairment in diabetic mice.",a59e9fd5-cad6-4704-a015-a85a235042b7
69,discussion5," In line with our study, a long-term IF treatment prevented diabetic microvascular complications by improving plasma TUdeoxycholic acid (DCA)21. The dietary-induced dysregulation of BA synthesis was found to be related to neuroplasticity impairment40. A recent human study has also reported a strong association between BA profiles and cognitive function, with the decreased plasma concentration of CA correlating particularly with AD progression41. In addition, BA homeostasis is essential for normal glucose/lipid homeostasis, which may partly explain why the energy metabolism-related genes were highly expressed in the db/db-IF group42,43.  Other important microbial metabolites altered by IF treatment in db/db mice include tryptophan and its metabolites 5-HT and indolepropionic acid (IPA). Tryptophan is not only an essential amino acid for protein synthesis but also is the precursor for a number of neuroprotective metabolites10,44.",614b23b3-cfa4-4859-a9ea-a5133bb4babc
70,discussion6," Gut microbiota plays a critical role in regulating the synthesis of 5-HT, a well-known key hormone/neurotransmitter of the gut–brain axis in regulating mood and cognition45. Interestingly, we found that IF increased 5-HT levels and suppressed anxiety in db/db mice (Fig. 1f–h; Supplementary Fig. 4G). We found that IF regimen enriched Lactobacillus, 5-HT and hippocampus gene expressions, supporting the previously reported effects of Lactobacillus genera on peripheral 5-HT synthesis and alleviating behavior impairments46 (Fig. 5). Moreover, indolepropionic acid (IPA), a microbial deamination metabolite of tryptophan, is a potent neuroprotective antioxidant. Higher plasma concentration of indolepropionic acid (IPA) was associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk in a recent study44. It has also been well reported for its role in preventing neuronal damage15.",6bfa8cfd-cd93-410c-aa93-191d46ddd4b4
71,discussion7," Consistently, we also found that indolepropionic acid (IPA) and 5-HT treatment significantly attenuated cognitive deficits in diabetic mice (Fig. 6). Taken together, our findings indicated that an IF regimen improved brain energy metabolism and cognitive function via restructuring gut microbiota and metabolites.  Notably, these IF-improved neuroprotective microbial metabolites are highly correlated with mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism-related gene expression in the hippocampus, which could shed light on a new mechanism for how IF alleviated diabetes-induced cognitive deficits (Fig. 5). Mitochondria, as the powerhouses for eukaryotic cells, generate ATP via of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to meet the majority of the enormous energy demands made by neurons47. A sufficient energy supply is required to maintain neuronal survival, neurotransmission, and the synaptic function.",6387eea5-2688-433a-bb5c-dc3a2b772dde
72,discussion8," The fasting process also triggers AMPK activation and mTOR inactivation, and subsequently stimulates the energy metabolism and upregulates mitochondrial function to meet the energy deficiency48,49. We found that IF improved mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism-related pathways, consistent with the upregulation of the AMPK/PGC1α pathway at the protein level (Fig. 3). Moreover, the microbial metabolites, i.e., 5-HT, TUdeoxycholic acid (DCA), and indolepropionic acid (IPA), have been well reported to be beneficial to mitochondrial biogenesis and function. 5-HT has been reported to prevented dopamine-induced oxidative damages of mitochondria and synaptosomes45. As mentioned ahead, TUdeoxycholic acid (DCA) is a potential neuroprotective agent13,14.",94a590a4-1946-49a8-8f8b-f8a7f58dcb67
73,discussion9," It has also been reported that TUdeoxycholic acid (DCA) treatment prevented cognitive deficits via improving mitochondrial function and reducing neuronal apoptosis in an indolepropionic acid (IPA) induced model of Huntington’s disease model14. Similarly, as one of the microbial metabolites, indolepropionic acid (IPA) has been reported to protect against Aβ-induced neuronal death and restore mitochondrial function15,50. SCFAs, generated from dietary fiber by gut microbiome, has been extensively studied as potential benefits for brain health51. Butyrate, for instance, was found to be a potential treatment for autism spectrum disorders as its bioactivity on enhancing mitochondrial function52. Here, we also found treatments of microbial metabolites also improved diabetes-related cognitive deficits and increasing mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 6).",773b4861-e2cf-43d7-9a43-72706579a806
74,discussion10,"  Furthermore, the beneficial effects of IF on cognitive function were suppressed after removing the gut microbiota in diabetic mice by antibiotics treatment (Fig. 6), suggesting a key role of microbiota composition and their derived metabolites in mediating IF- induced neuronal effects. Mitochondrial biogenesis was also downregulated by antibiotics in IF-treated mice, which further confirms that the restructured gut microbiota was highly correlated with hippocampal mitochondrial gene expression. Although there were several reports indicated that metronidazole could cross the blood–brain barrier and has potential neurotoxicity53–55. However, we did not observe any behavioral disorders in both db/m and db/db mice after antibiotics treatment (Fig. 6; Supplementary Fig. 7). Of note, antibiotics treatment alone also partly altered the food/water intake, insulin resistance, and cognitive behaviors in db/db mice (Fig. 6; Supplementary Fig.",17281c8c-1b8e-4fbb-9f5e-030533feb245
75,discussion11," 8), in line with a previous report revealing that metronidazole or vancomycin treatment improves brain insulin sensitivity and behavioral changes in obese and diabetic mice56. Besides, antibiotics treatment reduced the generation of SCFAs and indolepropionic acid (IPA), but not the levels of TUdeoxycholic acid (DCA) and 5-HT in IF-treated db/db mice (Supplementary Fig. 9). These results indicate that the efficiency of a combined treatment of an IF regimen and antibiotics in metabolic syndrome needs to be further investigated. It is also important to further investigate the molecules and pathways that transmit microbiota changes into the brain, which could lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets for metabolism-implicated cognitive deficits.  Overall, the current research suggests a novel and convincing link between gut microbiota and cognitive function via microbial metabolites under the treatment of an IF regimen in diabetic mice.",d15877bd-d5a1-4862-b6f2-6b7d6b518e34
76,discussion12," IF treatment restructured gut microbiome and altered microbial metabolites, upregulated hippocampus mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism, protected synaptic ultrastructure, and alleviated cognition and spatial memory impairments. The impact of IF on changes in microbiota/metabolites/genes should be further evaluated in clinical trials. Once validated, IF can be translated into a novel ecological approach for managing metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. ",c9aa1814-b3c6-4e70-a980-023f8f871d4e
