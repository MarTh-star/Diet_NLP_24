0,methods0," As the current study utilizing an high fat diet (HFD) was run in parallel with our previous study utilizing standard rodent chow diet [12], detailed methodologies of many of the materials and methods can be found in Henderson et al. [12]. Below, we provide brief materials and methods as well as detail aspects specific to the current study.  Animals and dietary interventions  All animal experiments adhered to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were performed with approval from the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)), protocol number 2016–1778 and 2019–2258. Male C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Stock No.",13ba1e59-959d-4480-bcae-8a00ccffd400
1,methods1," 000664, Jackson Laboratories) and group-housed (3–4 mice per cage) in the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute Biological Resource Unit on a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle, with temperature between 20 and 23 °C and 30–70% relative humidity. Mice had AL access to standard rodent chow (24% kcal from protein, 58% kcal from carbohydrate, and 18% kcal from fat; Teklad Global Rodent Diet #2918, Envigo) until approximately 2 months of age, and then switched to an obesogenic high fat diet (HFD) for 18 months (14% kcal from protein, 26% kcal from carbohydrate, and 60% kcal from fat; Bio-Serve Mouse Diet, High Fat, Soft Pellets, Fisher Scientific #14–726-603). At approximately 20 months of age, the two high fat diet (HFD) cages now housing 3 mice per cage (due to the mortal loss of one mouse prior to the intervention start) were randomly assigned to either the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) fasting intervention or continued on high fat diet (HFD) AL access.",e348de47-ed19-4b2f-b1a7-ee7f69820cca
2,methods2," The every other day (EOD) fasting regimen was followed as previously reported [12]. Briefly, the every other day (EOD) fasting regimen consisted of repeated cycles of 24-h consecutive removal of food access with water available AL (fast day) followed by 24-h access to food and water AL (fed day). To prevent disturbances in circadian feeding rhythms between the every other day (EOD) and AL groups [24, 25], the high fat diet (HFD) was provided to or removed from the every other day (EOD) group 2–3 h before the dark cycle onset (~ 19:00 h). During the course of the study, there was mortality; thus for several of the tests performed, the high fat diet (HFD) AL group had N = 2 mice, while the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) group continued to have N = 3 mice.",c532cfb5-f1b4-4161-90a2-124143a79b12
3,methods3," Due to this, in some tests in which the before diet intervention measurement was taken to compare to the endpoint measurement, the average value of the two remaining high fat diet (HFD) AL animals was used as the endpoint value to compare to the intervention start values for the deceased high fat diet (HFD) AL mouse.  Physiological and metabolic parameters  Body weight was measured throughout the study. Body composition was measured at baseline (day 0) and near the conclusion of the study (day 66 post-diet intervention, aka post-diet change [Post diet change (PDC)]) using EchoMRI body composition analysis (EchoMRI, Houston, TX). Glucose tolerance test (Glucose tolerance test (GTT)) was performed at 13:00 h on day 70 (day 69: fast day) after a 4-h morning fast. The mice were given an intraperitoneal (IP) glucose injection (2 g of glucose/kg body weight), and blood glucose measurements were recorded up to 120 min post-injection (Accu-Chek glucose meter, Roche Diabetes Care, Inc.",3d26363d-3d19-4e86-9c37-983d8a26b255
4,methods4,", Indianapolis, IN). The Glucose tolerance test (GTT) was repeated on day 71 (day 70 fed day).  Whole body metabolic rhythms and parameters were measured by Oxymax-CLAMS (Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System) indirect calorimetry (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) [26] at baseline and at the mid-point of the DI. Double-plotted traces of these measurements were made using the averaged data for each time point within a diet group separated by the fed and fast days with a time of the day expressed in Zeitgeber time (ZT), with most plots containing ~ 220 data points. In these metabolic cages, the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) mice were fed or fasted at approximately ZT9 daily.  Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production capacities of the liver, kidney, and muscle (quadriceps) were measured by the lead sulfide method as previously described [12, 27, 28].",940d29e6-1950-4dc4-ba87-7daa104d1c02
5,methods5," Briefly, tissues were immediately obtained from euthanized animals (6-month-old AL chow fed and 24-month-old AL chow and AL and every other day (EOD) high fat diet (HFD) fed C57BL/6 mice) and flash-frozen via placement in 1.5-mL tubes and submersion in liquid nitrogen. Flash-frozen tissues were then homogenized and lysed in 1 × passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) with the liver and kidney homogenized using a hand held homogenizer (Fisherbrand) and muscle homogenized using a Bullet Blender 24 with Pink Kit lysis beads (Next Advance). One hundred micrograms of normalized protein with 150 µL of reaction mixture containing 10 mM L-cysteine (Cat. #. 168,149, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 1 mM pyridoxal phosphate (Cat. # 9255, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in phosphate-buffered saline were placed in 96-well plates. A 20-mM lead acetate-embedded H2S detection filter paper was placed on top of the well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 1–24 h.",afa516e7-e6f8-4666-bedb-a54932d72648
6,methods6," H2S production capacity was quantified by measuring the lead sulfide darkening of the paper using the IntDen function in the ImageJ software package (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA, https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997–2018) and subtracting the background values from the reaction mixture blanks.  Neuromuscular and cognitive/behavioral tasks  The behavioral tasks were conducted in the order of (1) Y maze forced alternation task, (2) forelimb grip strength, (3) open field, (4) novel object location task, and (5) rotarod, and the order was kept constant for each animal. Behavioral sessions were digitally recorded using a CCTV camera mounted to the ceiling positioned directly above the behavioral apparatuses. All recorded behavioral sessions were analyzed using the behavior analysis software TopScanLite Version 2.0 (Clever Sys Inc., Reston, VA).",c2d5df97-da34-46bb-8b10-56a64b6b98df
7,methods7,"  Y maze forced alternation task  Short-term memory was tested using the Y maze forced alternation task at baseline and ~ day 50 post-DI. Mice were trained in the Y maze (each arm 12 cm H, 38.5 cm D, 9 cm W) surrounded by intra- and extra-maze visual cues. The acquisition trial was 15 min, and the mice did not have access to target arm. After a 2-h inter-trial interval (inter trial interval (ITI)), a 4-min memory (retention) test was given, and all of the Y maze arms were accessible. The duration and number of entries to each arm and velocity/speed during the retention trial were analyzed.  Open field  During the habituation phase of the novel object location test, the mice were given a 10-min open field trial at baseline and ~ day 59 post-DI. An open field (40.5 cm H × 51.0 cm D × 61.0 cm W) was virtually divided into 3 arenas: outer, middle, and center. Movement and exploratory behavior was digitally recorded for analysis.",090ef01f-c1fc-415f-8d5f-66c77387b271
8,methods8,"  Novel object location test  Twenty-four hours after the open field test, object location memory was tested using the novel object location test at baseline and ~ day 60 post-DI. In this task, two identical objects were placed at fixed and equidistant locations in the open field. The acquisition trial was 5 min. After a 24-h inter trial interval (ITI), a 2-min memory (retention) test was given. Mice were reintroduced to the identical environment and objects, except one of the objects was moved to a new “novel” location, located at the opposite corner relative to its original location. The other object remained at the same location.  Muscular strength and neuromuscular function parameters  Forelimb grip strength was assessed at baseline and ~ day 48 using a grip strength meter (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Each mouse was given five trials, and average grip strength adjusted to total body mass and lean mass was recorded.",57f74302-807f-4e5d-a117-7d119138cd13
9,methods9," Motor coordination was tested using a rotarod (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). In this test, the mice were given an acclimation trial (4 rpm for 30 s), followed by a total of four trials (max duration: 300 s, max speed: 50 rpm, acceleration: 1 rpm inclement per 11 s per trial) with 5-min inter trial interval (ITI). Latency and speed at which the mouse fell from or passively rotated on the revolving rod were recorded in trials 1–4 as a measure of motor coordination.  Statistical analyses  Figures depict the means ± SEM with N of 2–3 mice per group, with technical and/or repeated measurements as indicated in the figure legends and/or this “Statistical analyses” section. The behavior analysis software TopScanLite Version 2.0 (Clever Sys Inc., Reston, VA) was used for quantifying the behavioral tasks. All data were analyzed using Excel (Microsoft) and GraphPad Prism for Windows (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Results were considered statistically significant when p values were less than 0.",3fcaedf0-cb2e-4fba-978c-85d6ec0b8234

Source data and uncropped images used to generate the figures and their related statistics and tables are included as a supplemental GraphPad Prism file.  Body mass and change in body mass analyses between high fat diet (HFD) AL vs. high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) were performed as paired t-tests, with pairing done for each respective day measurements were taken. Comparison of before diet change to after diet change weights and body mass composition was done by unpaired Student’s t-test. For manual food intake analysis, unpaired t-tests were performed between high fat diet (HFD) AL vs. high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) on fasted days (a total of 7 different days measured), fed days (a total of 10 different days measured), and combined fasted and fed days (a grand total of 17 different days food intake was measured on a cage by cage basis).",41688643-9426-4bf5-b91a-fb0abe9f8148
11,methods11," For automatic feeding analysis from the metabolic chambers, paired t-tests were performed for each animal’s time point reading (a total of ~ 220 plotted/animal) to account for circadian differences in feeding patterns throughout the day. Likewise, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), vCO2, vO2, heat, horizontal beam crossings, and rearing data obtained from the metabolic chambers were also analyzed by paired t-tests between high fat diet (HFD) AL versus high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD), with pairings for each animal’s time point reading (~ 220 time points plotted/animal). This pairing enables normalization for the impact circadian rhythm has on these parameters at specific time points throughout the day. This is similar to performing area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) analysis, but helps further take into account the expected circadian shifts.",7d2542a4-6fb1-4140-a443-e878ee8dc4df
12,methods12," Glucose tolerance test (GTT) analysis was performed as a paired t-test between high fat diet (HFD) AL versus high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD), with pairing done for each animal’s blood glucose value at each of the 5 time points during the 120-min Glucose tolerance test (GTT). Grip strength was analyzed via 2-way ANOVA. Post-diet change (Post diet change (PDC)) rotarod performance between high fat diet (HFD) AL versus high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) was analyzed as a paired t-test, with pairings done for each animal’s duration and speed values at each of the 4 individual time trials. For cognitive tests such as Y maze, open field, and novel object recognition, 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests were performed. For H2S production capacity assays, 1-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test was performed. ",de61fac2-f914-45ba-ba78-7a0848bd19a8
13,results0," Late-life every other day (EOD) fasting on an high fat diet (HFD) background reduces total body mass and preserves lean mass compared to AL fed controls  Changes in physical appearance, total body weight, body mass composition in the form of fat and lean masses, and other frailty measurements were observed from baseline to day 76 Post diet change (PDC) (Fig. 1a). every other day (EOD) fasting under the high fat diet (HFD) background diminished the oily/greasy appearance of the fur compared to the high fat diet (HFD) AL group (Fig. 1b), resulting in a coat of similar appearance as the mice of similar age fed AL and every other day (EOD) on standard rodent chow diet. Body mass (BM) was gradually and continuously decreased in both the high fat diet (HFD) AL and high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) mice during the 2.5 months (Fig. 1c) with high fat diet (HFD) AL mice losing approximately 20% and high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) losing approximately 32% (Fig. 1d).",39e10cc4-d741-4928-8f7a-d47c9b0fcf0d
14,results1," Overall, BM loss during the 2.5 months was more pronounced in the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) group than in the high fat diet (HFD) AL group, and followed a similar trend to what was observed between standard chow every other day (EOD) versus standard chow AL [12] (Supplemental Fig. 1a). While both high fat diet (HFD) AL and high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) groups lost weight, it should be noted that changes in BM composition, defined as % of body weight (BW), were not similar. high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) mice maintained greater lean mass (40% BW vs. 38% BW) and lost more fat mass (35% BW vs. 42% BW) compared to high fat diet (HFD) AL mice (Fig. 1e).",eb71b323-9cea-4335-9e05-96f354e586ba
15,results2," Thus, the every other day (EOD) fasting regimen in aged mice on the high fat diet (HFD) background was sufficient for weight loss by promoting greater fat loss and preserving lean mass compared to high fat diet (HFD) AL mice, suggesting the every other day (EOD) fasting intervention may mitigate the onset and/or severity of aging-related sarcopenia, which is defined as the involuntary loss of skeletal muscle and lean mass [29, 30] and more so present in the high fat diet (HFD) AL group.  Consistent with our previous study, we measured the effects of every other day (EOD) fasting in the high fat diet (HFD) group. Food consumption (kcal consumed adjusted to BM) was measured several times over the 78 days of diet intervention to determine average food intake during the fast days (7 total days measured) (Fig. 1f), the fed days (10 total days measured) (Fig. 1g), and combined (7 + 10 = 17 total days measured) (Fig. 1h).",e9377966-4a02-4fad-881a-d245f19cedff
16,results3," As expected, there was a reduction in food intake on the fasted day for the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) group compared to the high fat diet (HFD) AL group. In contrast, on the fed days, the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) mice had only a slight but not significant increase in food intake compared to high fat diet (HFD) AL. Thus, the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) mice could not completely overcompensate or make up for the missed food intake on the fed days. We also investigated circadian food intake patterns at a higher resolution utilizing metabolic chambers that automatically measured food intake every 20 min over a 4-day span. high fat diet (HFD) AL mice consumed food consistently (or at a constant rate) throughout the 24-h period, but predominantly just prior to and during the early dark phase (Supplemental Fig. 1b).",2cbdb964-9cb7-4898-a031-ff9223682926
17,results4," While the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) group obviously consumed no food during the fasting period, they ate the provided food during the 24-h fed period throughout the dark phase as well as a second peak in the second half of the light phase (Supplemental Fig. 1b). Overall, in the course of the 2.5-month intervention, the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) mice consumed approximately 30% less kcal/food/g body mass compared to high fat diet (HFD) AL mice.  Late-life every other day (EOD) fasting on high fat diet (HFD) background improves carbohydrate utilization and metabolism  Metabolic activity, flexibility, and glucose utilization were measured using indirect calorimetry. Using this system, we first examined the impact of the every other day (EOD) fasting on the respiratory exchange ratio (respiratory exchange ratio (RER)), which is calculated by dividing the vCO2 produced by the vO2 consumed (Fig. 2a).",b4a74bb9-20a8-4358-8094-450336e90f9c
18,results5," Similar to what we observed in mice under standard chow diet backgrounds [12], the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) mice had an increased dynamic circadian rhythm of respiratory exchange ratio (RER) by extending the time interval between peaks as well as increased amplitudes of respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during the dark and light phases of the fed days (Fig. 2a). These findings reflect that every other day (EOD) fasting on the high fat diet (HFD) background resulted in a shift from fatty acid to carbohydrate oxidation depending on food availability. These results indicate that every other day (EOD) fasting initiated late in life even on the high fat diet (HFD) background is sufficient to prompt differential fuel utilization and macronutrient oxidation.Fig. 2 Late-life every other day (EOD) fasting on high fat diet (HFD) background improves carbohydrate utilization and metabolism while lowering overall metabolic output.",53f50707-92a0-42b6-b593-170d2c384113

See also Supplemental Fig. 2  Given that high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) fasting amplified the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) closer to 1.0 compared to high fat diet (HFD) AL when both had access to food, which is indicative of increased glucose utilization [26], we next tested glucose tolerance handling and clearance using the Glucose tolerance test (GTT). Figure 2b shows each time point in the 120-min Glucose tolerance test (GTT) prior to and post glucose administration compiled and averaged from Glucose tolerance test (GTT)s performed on adjacent fasted and fed days.",919861a9-521d-4102-a9ff-07d725542e2f
22,results9," Despite there being only a small increase in fasting blood glucose at the 0-min time point for the high fat diet (HFD) AL group, the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) group had enhanced glucose tolerance and clearance compared to the high fat diet (HFD) AL groups throughout the 120-min test (Fig. 2b). This improved glucose tolerance was most prominent in the 60- to 120-min post-infusion period. These positive effects of every other day (EOD) fasting on glucose tolerance were somewhat attenuated when examining the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) group’s Glucose tolerance test (GTT) performance data contrasted across fed versus fast day (Supplemental Fig. 2a). Thus, every other day (EOD) fasting on the high fat diet (HFD) background improves glucose utilization and metabolism; however, the results may be somewhat transient and dependent on the Glucose tolerance test (GTT) being administered after a fed or fasted day.",3cf38f88-9483-4cf0-aa79-d47dee652880
23,results10,"  To determine individual metabolic parameters that go into the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), such as vO2 and vCO2, we utilized the OxymaxCLAMS. In doing so, we took into consideration the contributions of the whole body mass as well as just lean mass in impacting these metabolic readouts. This is important, as we show losses in %fat and %lean mass were not equal between the high fat diet (HFD) AL and high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) groups (Fig. 1e) and that lean tissue is more metabolically active than fat tissue [31–34]. Thus, we examined our indirect calorimetry data by adjusting vCO2, vO2, and heat to the individual lean mass or the total body mass of each mouse (Fig. 2c–h). Circadian shifts in vCO2, vO2, and energy expenditure as measured by heat were observed for both high fat diet (HFD) AL and high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD), with elevated outputs detected during the dark phases relative to the light phases.",c1c4bd86-9a31-4491-9613-070306d21ae8
24,results11," In all readouts regardless of lean mass normalization or total body mass normalization, the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) group had reduced overall vCO2 (Fig. 2c, e), vO2 (Fig. 2d, f), and heat production (Fig. 2g, h) throughout all phases, and these were even more prominent during the fast days. Taken together, these findings indicate every other day (EOD) fasting on the high fat diet (HFD) background enhanced glucose utilization and metabolism while also lowering overall metabolic output with decreased vCO2, vO2, and heat production.  Late-life every other day (EOD) fasting on high fat diet (HFD) background improves spontaneous activity and neuromuscular coordination  With aging comes decreases in physical activity, strength, and coordination and these are exacerbated under a high fat diet (HFD) [35]. Thus, we next examined the impact of late-life initiated every other day (EOD) fasting under a high fat diet (HFD) background on spontaneous activity (Fig.",0ea26c1d-9874-4f22-ba0d-4bf73c149792
25,results12," 3a, b), muscular strength (Fig. 3c, d), and neuromuscular coordination (Fig. 3e, f, and Supplemental Fig. 3a). Utilizing again the indirect calorimetry OxymaxCLAMS cages, we monitored spontaneous activity in the form of beam crossings (horizontal movement; Fig. 3a) and rearing (vertical activity; Fig. 3b) in the mice throughout light and dark cycles of both fast and fed periods. In both of these parameters, the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) group had increased activity compared to high fat diet (HFD) AL mice, and this was most noticeable for rearing activity during the light period on fast days demonstrating an increased exploratory behavior (Fig. 3b). Unlike what we previously detected in standard chow every other day (EOD) mice [12], the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) mice here did not have total body mass- or lean mass-normalized improvements in the Post diet change (PDC) tests for forelimb muscle grip strength (Fig. 3c, d).",5dee9891-d703-4aef-aeb5-5f1b99bea80d

Taken together, these findings suggest that every other day (EOD) fasting on the high fat diet (HFD) background in late life improves spontaneous activity and motor coordination without improving muscular strength.Fig. 3 Spontaneous activity, forelimb strength, and neuromuscular coordination in aged mice under high fat diet (HFD) AL or high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) fasting diets.",4826cab2-1f1e-4ffe-a22a-f39fc93d4b99

29,results16," 3  Late-life every other day (EOD) fasting on a high fat diet (HFD) background fails to improve hippocampal-dependent memory and behavior along with renal hydrogen sulfide production  As with physical activity capacities, there are declines in learning and memory capacities with age [40, 41]. In our previous study, we determined that late-life initiated every other day (EOD) fasting under a standard rodent chow diet improved hippocampal-dependent memory in a variety of tests [12]. However, if such an intervention is effective under a high fat diet (HFD) background is unknown. Thus, we performed a battery of cognitive/behavior experiments, which included the Y maze, open field, and novel object location tests, to determine if late-life initiated every other day (EOD) fasting preserves and/or improves hippocampal function and anxiety under an high fat diet (HFD) background.

In our final behavioral tasks, we conducted the novel object location (novel object location (NOL)) test Before diet change (BDC) and Post diet change (PDC) to further examine the impact of high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) fasting on spatial memory. Unlike in the chow every other day (EOD) mice from our previous experiment [12], the every other day (EOD) fasting did not affect discrimination index Post diet change (PDC) in the high fat diet (HFD) group (Fig. 4e), suggesting from our relatively small sample size that a high fat diet (HFD) may inhibit the positive effects of every other day (EOD) fasting on long-term object location memory.",cd95a5cc-8b4b-45ec-af59-e18b3b281ae6
34,results21,"  Our previous work related to fasting [12] and environmental endocrine disruption [42] suggested renal hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production as a positive factor driving hippocampal-dependent memory and behavior. Notably, we found the aged chow every other day (EOD) mice from our previous study to have enhanced renal H2S production after the dietary intervention [12]. Endogenous H2S production and its signaling via protein persulfidation are recognized as potential causal factors in animal models of increased healthspan and lifespan [28, 43–46]. Conversely, there is a loss of H2S production and/or sulfide levels in the liver and kidney in rodents [47, 48] and in the circulation of humans [49] as a function of advancing age.",e8abeac8-6a19-44fc-955e-be8ab639afce
35,results22," Thus, as we failed to detect improvements in hippocampal-dependent memory under the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) diet, we next probed how aging and the high fat diet (HFD) impacted the ability of every other day (EOD) fasting to modulate tissue-specific H2S production. Aging in general caused for a decrease in hepatic H2S production capacity in 2-year-old mice compared to 6-month-old mice, and this decrease was made more severe in 2-year-old mice under a high fat diet (HFD) (Supplemental Fig. 4d). Likewise, the long-term high fat diet (HFD) prevented every other day (EOD) fasting-induced augmentation of both renal and hepatic H2S production capacity (Fig. 4f) which is in contrast to what we previously detected on the lower fat diet chow background [12].",ae92e846-d1da-4528-a328-a392c614615b

Furthermore, unlike our previous study, the mice in the current work at the initiation of the dietary intervention were already obese from 18 prior months of the high fat diet (HFD); thus, we also investigated the ability of the every other day (EOD) fasting to reverse the physiological, metabolic, and cognitive damages inflicted from the long-term high fat diet (HFD).

39,discussion2," Green plus sign indicates improvement, and red minus sign indicates no improvement or no change, after the every other day (EOD) fasting intervention compared to AL fed controls and/or to pre-intervention status  It has been widely shown for over a century that DR in one form or another without malnutrition stands as one of the best methods to counter both obesity and aging/aging-associated morbidities in animal models and controlled human trials [50–53]. Yet, even with our extensive knowledge on the nutritional, molecular, and temporal mechanisms and triggers for implementing DR for these benefits, it has been incredibly difficult for us as humans to implement these into our everyday lives and adhere to them long term to ultimately reduce energy intake [18, 54]. This hesitancy to adhere to DR is highlighted in recent results from the CALERIE study, in which voluntary subjects aimed for 25% CR over 2 years but ultimately only obtained 14% CR [18, 55, 56].",7de052f5-7992-4e25-a091-c870d3cc4594
40,discussion3," Despite falling short of the CR goal, the individuals undergoing 14% CR still showed reduced adiposity and improved glucose utilization and insulin sensitivity [18, 55, 56]. Thus, even slight deficits in caloric intake and/or implementation of a meal schedule may provide a defense against obesity. As traditional CR may be difficult to adhere to long term, utilizing other DR regimes that have high compliance, safety, and ease of use will provide a window to address obesity and aging. This is where intermittent fasting, such as the every other day (EOD) fasting and timed feeding utilized in our previous study [12] and reviewed extensively elsewhere [57–59], presents itself as a somewhat more easily adaptable and viable approach to lower caloric intake and/or constrain feeding periodicity for improving physiological, metabolic, and aging-related endpoints.",ad502d06-6884-4ec9-b5aa-e256b71d7218
41,discussion4,"  While our prior work and the work of others have primarily focused on every other day (EOD) fasting on a standard non-high fat diet (HFD), there are studies in addition to what is presented here that have examined every other day (EOD) fasting as a therapeutic approach in clinical trials with obese individuals [60–63] as well as in laboratory rodent models on an high fat diet (HFD) background [64–67]. In the human trials on obese female subjects aged 25–65 with a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 39.9 kg/m2 randomized to every other day (EOD) fasting for 8 weeks on either low-fat diet (low fat diet (LFD)) or high fat diet (HFD) backgrounds, it was found that every other day (EOD) fasting was equally as effective in both diet backgrounds for reducing overall weight by ~ 4–5%, diminishing fat mass but not lean mass, and improving coronary heart disease risk factors [60].",1529800d-1700-4ba5-9867-9e0920548ea0
42,discussion5," These results mirror our results obtained here with high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) fasting as an effective strategy for weight loss and lean mass maintenance. In the rodent tests, it was found that in male C57BL/6 J mice made obese by feeding a 60% high fat diet (HFD) for 15 weeks and then undergoing high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) fasting for approximate 2.5 months, the every other day (EOD) fasting reduced the overall food intake, reduced the overall body mass by approximately 33%, and improved glucose tolerance [66]. These results are in line with those we observed in our current study. However, it should be noted that despite the high fat diet (HFD) every other day (EOD) fasting period of the two studies being similar at 2.",f1c7cda2-7bf2-4ecc-9925-175e7a29567d

Thus, the every other day (EOD) fasting regimen on an high fat diet (HFD) background is effective in both young and old obese mice, as well as humans, for lowering body mass and improving physiological parameters. However, results from every other day (EOD) fasting on low fat diet (LFD) rather than high fat diet (HFD) appear to be more beneficial in general and would most likely provide desired outcomes when utilized in humans.  There are several technical and experimental design limitations to our current study. The first includes the small sample sizes of mice in each diet group.",7ade7f35-a227-4429-b421-2c6123a42017
44,discussion7," This is primarily due to the difficulties of generating large cohorts of mice aged 20 + months that have been on long-term high fat diet (HFD) due to accelerated diet-induced mortality. However, the ability to compare the results between AL versus every other day (EOD) fasting groups at the conclusion of the study on the high fat diet (HFD) as well as the Before diet change (BDC) and Post diet change (PDC) data for the every other day (EOD) group provides additional robustness and confidence in our findings. Likewise, the parallel study we recently published [12] serves as a thorough comparison to these current findings and emphasizes what physiological, metabolic, and cognitive endpoints are most impacted as a result of dietary composition and every other day (EOD) fasting in aged mice.  While most endpoints were similarly improved after the 2.",23b7fadc-5596-434e-9e19-176172e8254e
45,discussion8,"5 months of every other day (EOD) fasting on low fat diet (LFD) and high fat diet (HFD), the inability of every other day (EOD) fasting on the high fat diet (HFD) to improve muscle strength and hippocampal-dependent memory is somewhat puzzling and we also do not provide a direct mechanism for these failures. However, as our previous examinations of renal H2S production after every other day (EOD) fasting on a low fat diet (LFD) background showed strong positive correlations with behavioral and cognitive performance [12, 42], the lack of such enhancement in renal H2S production seen here under the high fat diet (HFD) background could provide a potential mechanism for the null cognitive improvement under every other day (EOD) fasting.",3dde0a2a-91ed-4326-bf80-a288d29a0285
46,discussion9," These results could indicate that exposure to the long-term high fat diet (HFD) irreversibly ablates the ability to improve muscle strength, cognition, and renal H2S production at advanced ages, but not for improvements in glucose tolerance, body mass composition, and spontaneous activity. Alternatively, they may require longer dietary intervention than 2.5 months after a lifetime of high fat diet (HFD) and it may just be a slowed process for improvements in the former endpoints. Similarly, the use of a more human-relevant 45% kcal high fat diet (HFD) [68] versus the 60% kcal high fat diet (HFD) used here could possibly shift the results to mirror what was obtained on a low fat diet (LFD) and provide better translational appeal for interventions in humans.",70ccd2f0-65aa-40bb-a8ce-425bff390dfa
47,discussion10,"  Future studies including female cohorts under the high fat diet (HFD) background would also be interesting as we previously did not see as great of improvements in frailty endpoints for female mice under every other day (EOD) fasting as we did for male mice under every other day (EOD) fasting on the low fat diet (LFD) background possibly due to differences in feeding compensation on the fed days and/or hormonal impacts of fasting responses [12]. Nonetheless, the limited number of individual mice, using only males, and using only one strain in this Short Communication presents the need for future studies incorporating larger cohorts of both males and females of diverse strain and genetic backgrounds.",cd81b3a2-2f57-4771-aa65-4c5e10be191f
48,discussion11,"  The rising worldwide obesity pandemic, postulated to be caused by a number of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle variables [69–72], necessitates for effective personal, clinical, and public health interventions to counter and reverse the onset of obesity and its associated co-morbidities. Additionally, rapid and continuous declines in physical, metabolic, and cognitive/behavioral health and the advent of frailty from synergisms of obesity and aging require preventative as well as reactionary therapeutic approaches to address both [6–8]. With readily available and easily accessed high-fat/high-calorie foods, dietary interventions to combat both obesity and aging may have to incorporate these types of foods. Thus, the every other day (EOD) fasting program we have presented here on the high fat diet (HFD) background presents as a viable and effective option to counter obesity, even in late life.",ab2e15b8-f841-4d56-ad51-d00a8a9f487f
