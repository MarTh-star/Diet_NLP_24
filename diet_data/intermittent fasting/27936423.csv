0,introduction0,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, presenting a memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. The disorder is morphologically characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) combined with formation of neuritis spot and neurofibrillary tangles (neurofibrillary tangles (NFT)) as well as death and loss of cholinergic neurons . The “Aβ cascade hypothesis” considers Aβ species to be the molecular triggers of a cascade of events (amyloid cascade) leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002). Accordingly, targets reducing the brain Aβ burden may be alternative strategies for AD therapy and prevention.  Ketone bodies have demonstrated efficacy in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders and in human clinical trials, including AD trials (Henderson, 2008).",ccb13969-139d-4e79-a44e-fc2a360faf73
1,introduction1," Acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB) account for the majority of ketone bodies (Robinson and Williamson, 1980). AcAc and βOHB is a redox pair, which can be converted to each other based on the redox state of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)/NADH couple (Laffel, 1999). Ketone bodies are normally produced by the liver from fatty acids when glucose supplies are limited, such as an acute fasting  or intermittent fasting . Intermittent fasting is an umbrella term for various diets that cycle between a period of fasting and non-fasting. Notably, researchers have found that intermittent fasting plays a role in forestalling the onset of certain neurodegenerative disorders, including AD . Our previous study has also shown that intermittent fasting can improve cognitive function and protect against brain Aβ deposition in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD (Zhang et al., 2017b).",f0cb7b58-ed83-4f44-ab42-f5cdd98d5a47
2,introduction2," From the above, ketone bodies may be implicated in the anti-AD effect of intermittent fasting. What's important, about 70% of ketone bodies are βOHB (Robinson and Williamson, 1980), which has been reported to provide protection against AD . Therefore, βOHB may play a major role in the protection of intermittent fasting against AD. Moreover, as an endogenous pan-histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor, βOHB can suppress HDAC2 and HDAC3 . Accumulating evidence has indicated that the levels of histone acetylation are significantly reduced and the expression of HDAC2/3 is remarkably increased in the brain of AD (Xu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017a). However, it is still unknown whether βOHB participates in the anti-AD effect of intermittent fasting through affecting the levels of histone acetylation to regulate AD-related gene expression.",e6ab8b8b-3ee5-4db4-8c12-62b2f213ed8d
3,introduction3,"  Lipoprotein lipase (lipoprotein lipase (LPL)) is a member of the lipase gene family, which most widely distributes in adipose, heart, and skeletal muscle tissue, as well as in brain . Notably, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) protein located in the brain capillary endothelial cells is thought to be derived from peripheral tissue . The genetic polymorphism of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) has been found to be closely related to the onset of AD . lipoprotein lipase (LPL) has also been documented to accumulate in senile plaques of AD brains , and as a molecular chaperone to bind to Aβ . As a key enzyme in lipoprotein metabolism, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) has been found to be increased in adipose and decreased in muscle tissue by fasting, exhibiting tissue specificity .",a0d87155-e06b-4ec2-a7d8-2bcb29dde44f
4,introduction4," However, it is not clear the effect of intermittent fasting on the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in brain. Furthermore, the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was increased in adipose cells by treatment with a HDACs inhibitor diallyl disulfide , but decreased in mesenchymal stem cells treated by sodium butyrate, another HDACs inhibitor . In the context of previous observations, this study investigated whether intermittent fasting up-regulates or down-regulates the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) by βOHB-mediated inhibition of HDACs in AD brain.  In oxLDL-stimulated dendritic cells, the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was repressed by microRNA-29a (miR-29a) .",f31b78a6-5fc6-446d-8b44-a8dc1f4e4461
5,introduction5," MicroRNAs, a novel class of short (~22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs, are identified as important post-transcriptional inhibitors of gene expression by base pairing with the 3′untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs and promoting mRNA stability . The expression of microRNAs can also be regulated by histone acetylation. However, it is unknown whether miR-29a is implicated in HDACs-mediated regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in the effect of βOHB against AD.  In the present study, we found that intermittent fasting inhibited the increase of brain-derived lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in AD, which was partly mediated by βOHB. Furthermore, miR-29a was found to mediate the effect of βOHB on lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression, which HDAC2/3 may be implicated in the regulation of miR-29a expression by βOHB.",55960ae4-6451-4412-aec1-8ea7cf28ae29
6,introduction6," Importantly, our findings indicated that in SH-SY5Y cells, different concentrations of Aβ (2 or 10 μM) have opposite effects on the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression, as well miR-29a, which were reversed by βOHB. The expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was reduced and miR-29a was up-regulated in HDAC2-silenced SH-SY5Y cells; however, silencing HDAC3 has opposite effects on the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and miR-29a expression.

Alteration of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and miR-29a expression in HDAC2- and HDAC3-silenced SH-SY5Y cells To further determinate whether HDAC2/3 regulates lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and miR-29a expression, the endogenous HDAC2 and HDAC3 mRNA expression levels in cells were interfered by HDAC2 and HDAC3 siRNA duplex (Figure 9).",5faa85eb-7a0e-46d7-9285-5a9bb88c3a16

33,discussion0,"Accumulating evidence has indicated that lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is implicated in the progression of AD (Baum et al., 2000; Wang and Eckel, 2012). In human studies, the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA was increased in the brain of AD patients . The present study also showed a significant increase in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA expression in the cerebral cortex of AD model mice; however, there were no obvious changes in protein expression level of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) among groups by Western blot or immunofluorescence staining. lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is synthesized and secreted into the surrounding interstitial spaces by cells .",7a9fe6af-6578-4c07-b497-968faa65af81
34,discussion1," Subsequently, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is transported into the lumen of capillaries by the protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) which is expressed in endothelial cells and then bands with endothelial cell surface heparan sulfated proteoglycans . Since the distribution of GPIHBP1 in the brain capillaries is extremely sparse, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) protein located in the brain capillaries endothelial cells is thought to be derived from peripheral tissue . In brief, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) protein in brain tissue derives from not only brain itself but also peripheral tissue which is located in brain capillaries endothelial cells. In this study, the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) protein located in capillaries endothelial cells was reduced in the cerebral cortex of AD model mice.",4a7668c9-4236-4d47-9b5c-e2cfe2742977
35,discussion2," Considering no obvious difference in the total expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) protein, the expression of brain-derived lipoprotein lipase (LPL) protein was possibly increased in AD model mice, which is in line with the mRNA expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Further study is still needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of down-regulation in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) protein expression in capillaries endothelial cells of cerebral cortex in AD model mice. Furthermore, alternate day fasting (ADF) was found to play a role in protecting against the increase of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA and brain-derived lipoprotein lipase (LPL) protein expression in the cerebral cortex of AD model mice, indicating that lipoprotein lipase (LPL) may participate in the effect of alternate day fasting (ADF) on AD.  alternate day fasting (ADF) has been reported to increase the serum level of βOHB .",0f228aea-355a-46c3-9ef0-be1abd692ced
36,discussion3," Our preliminary experiment found the level of βOHB in blood increased after 12h or longer fasting in C57BL/6 mice. Tadahiro et al found βOHB concentration increased to about 10-fold in the serum of C57BL/6 mice after a 24-h fasting . Therefore, alternate day fasting (ADF) may cause a regularly fluctuant change in the level of βOHB in mice. Furthermore, Anson et al investigated serum levels of βOHB after 14 h fasting in C57BL/6 mice fed ad libitum and mice treated with alternate day fasting (ADF) for 20 weeks, and the results showed the serum level of βOHB increased to 2-fold in mice treated with alternate day fasting (ADF) compared with mice fed ad libitum . These indicated that intermittent fasting may be different in metabolism with an acute fasting. Also, βOHB has been reported to take effect in delaying AD progression in several studies .",6577c17a-9fa8-4359-a77a-a6b6b28eb759
37,discussion4," Accordingly, βOHB may play a crucial role in protective function of alternate day fasting (ADF) against AD. In our in vitro study, we found that βOHB inhibited the increase of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in cells exposed to low concentrations of Aβ (2 μM), in agreement with the results from in vivo study. These suggested that βOHB may mediate, at least partly, the effect of alternate day fasting (ADF) on the reduction of brain-derived lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in AD. Interestingly, the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was found to be decreased in cells exposure to high concentrations of Aβ (10 μM) which was also reversed by βOHB. Gong et al. (2013) reported that the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) protein was significantly decreased in granule cells of the dentate gyrus in AD patients, in lines with our results from cells treated with 10 μM Aβ.",8f1d4e08-6f70-451f-848b-b7b24d10ed62
38,discussion5," The above suggested that in the different stages of AD progression, the alteration in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression level may be varied, increase first and then decrease. Moreover, the disagreement in regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in AD may be also associated with differences in the brain regions investigated.  In in vitro study, βOHB inhibited the decrease of AceH3K9 and Ace-H4K12 levels in Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells. alternate day fasting (ADF) was also found to alleviate the decrease of Ace-H3K9 and Ace-H4K12 levels in the cerebral cortex of AD model mice. HDACs are a class of enzymes that can regulate the level of histone acetylation. Tadahiro et al found that it is βOHB not AcAc inhibits HDACs during fasting for 24 h . These findings provided vital clues that inhibition of HDACs by βOHB plays a role in regulation of alternate day fasting (ADF) on lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression.",0ec44d58-9705-4b68-b7dd-69a4b12dc236
39,discussion6," A HDAC inhibitor (diallyl disulfide) has been reported to induce lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in adipocyte cells . However, the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate suppressed lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in mesenchymal stem cells . The above inconsistent results may be due to the differences in HDAC subtype inhibited and cells used. HDACs are divided into four groups in mammals: the zinc-dependent class I, II and IV HDACs, and the NAD+-dependent class III HDACs. Class I HDAC2 and HDAC3 have been found to be implicated in AD . In this study, alternate day fasting (ADF) and βOHB were found to alleviate the increase of HDAC2/3 expression in the cerebral cortex of AD model mice and Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells, respectively. Interestingly, we found that the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was elevated in HDAC3-silenced but reduced in HDAC2-silenced SH-SY5Y cells.",339b40b8-81a1-4fa2-8775-0b527d1bf984
40,discussion7," The mechanism on the opposite effects of HDAC2/3 on the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression is still unclear. It is necessary to further study whether the above opposite effect of HDAC2 and HDAC3 participates in the mechanism on the opposite effects of different concentrations of Aβ on the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in the presence or absence of βOHB.  MiR-29a has been documented to repress the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in oxLDL-stimulated dendritic cells . In the present study, decreased miR-29a levels were found in the cerebral cortex of AD model mice and SH-SY5Y cells induced by 2 μM Aβ, which were alleviated by alternate day fasting (ADF) and βOHB, respectively. In addition, miR-29a level was increased in 10 μM Aβ induced SH-SY5Y cells, which was also alleviated by βOHB.",69c04a43-2f9e-4b04-b4d8-0e5fbc1e3ed4
41,discussion8," Further research confirmed that lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression was decreased in cells treated with miR-29a mimic, and increased in cells treated with miR-29a inhibitor. Moreover, we found that the expression of miR-29a was elevated in HDAC2-silenced and reduced in HDAC3-silenced SH-SY5Y cells. These findings suggest that miR-29a plays a key role in the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which mediates, at least partly, the regulation of HDACs on lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in AD. Further study is needed to examine the roles of HDAC2/3 in the regulatory mechanisms on miR-29a.  In summary, in the present study, alternate day fasting (ADF) was observed to alleviate the increase of brain-derived lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in AD model mice, which was partly mediated by βOHB. Furthermore, miR-29a was found to mediate the effect of βOHB on lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression, which HDAC2/3 may be implicated in the effect of βOHB on miR-29a expression.",65f000a6-ac48-4185-a78e-efe4da223d46
42,discussion9," This study also found HDAC2 and HDAC3 exerted the opposite effects on the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and miR-29a expression levels. Further study is necessary to investigate whether other βOHB-modulated HDAC subtypes are involved in the effect on lipoprotein lipase (LPL). As a redox pair with AcAc, βOHB may also participate in protecting against AD via anti-oxidation pathway . Intermittent fasting may be utilized as a potential candidate for AD therapy and prevention. However, considering the conclusions that we obtained in regard to AD models of in vivo and in vitro, it should be prudent to extrapolate it from AD models to humans.
