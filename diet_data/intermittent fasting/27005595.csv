0,introduction0,"Circadian rhythms control many physiologic processes, including energy metabolism, hormone biosynthesis, and immune responses. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the main transcriptome in mammalian cells is expressed with a circadian rhythm. Indeed, studies examining the physiologic effects of sleep restriction, reported changes in the circadian timing system [1], as well as immune [2] and endocrine [3, 4] variables.  In the recent years, the molecular mechanisms that control the circadian rhythm, also known as the “molecular clock”, have been identified [5]. These consist of a series of interlocked transcriptional-translational feedback loops, with one of the major loops being the CLOCK/BMAL1 loop [6, 7]. Circadian clock genes are expressed in a circadian fashion in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)) of mammals, constituting the “master” circadian pacemaker of the organism.",9c0111b4-be60-4313-9f93-b006443a2ae2
1,introduction1," The important link between the CLOCK gene and intermediary metabolism has been shown in CLOCK knock-out mice, which have impaired glucose tolerance and insulin secretion, resulting in a diabetic phenotype [8].  Current work suggest a major role for shift-work induced alterations in core circadian clock genes [9, 10] in disrupting circadian metabolic regulation, and in inducing various shift-work associated diseases [11–13]. In a similar manner to shift workers, during the fasting month of Ramadan, Muslims in Saudi Arabia experience severe disturbance in their sleeping patterns, with loss of night-time sleep and shortening of sleep duration. This can be associated with the loss of the circadian rhythm of cortisol, a hormone that controls the expression of many other hormones, and cytokines including adipokines [14].",2f69e912-58e2-465f-bcc6-e7b1d7556962
2,introduction2," This loss of circadian rhythmicity might be related to alterations in the expression of clock genes, resulting in hypercortisolism and chronic smoldering inflammation, increasing the risk of chronic cardiometabolic disorders.  One of many important genes upregulated by cortisol is the Dual Specific Phosphatases (Dual Specific Phosphatases (DUSP)) gene [15]. Dual Specific Phosphatases (DUSP) comprise a group of enzymes that can dephosphorylate both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues of their protein substrates. A big subset of the Dual Specific Phosphatases (DUSP) family contain in addition to the common phosphatase domain a mitogen activated protein kinases (mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK)) binding domain, allowing it therefore to dephosphorylate, and thus deactivate mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) [16].",863ac6c3-399b-44c4-bfe8-e979e6f146d4
3,introduction3," mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) proteins are protein kinases that respond to various cell stimuli such as; mitogenic signals, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative/heat stress to regulate various cell functions. Thus, through regulating mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), Dual Specific Phosphatases (DUSP) proteins play an important role in cell responses to environmental stress. Indeed, Dual Specific Phosphatases (DUSP) can through negative regulation prevent the deleterious effect of a persistent innate immune response [17].  IL-1 is one of the most potent innate immunity cytokines, playing a key role in inflammation initiation and perpetuation [18]. This cytokine is predominantly secreted by innate immune cells and acts to activate both innate and adaptive immune responses.It has also been associated with autoimmunity and auto-inflammation, including type 2 diabetes mellitus.",27a95eab-bf70-47ac-b68d-e1754d14d13d
4,introduction4," The importance of the circadian clock in IL-1β expression has been demonstrated in Per2 deficient mice, which showed higher levels of IL-1β and IFN-γ in the serum, and a stronger vulnerability to LPS-induced endotoxin shock than wild type mice [19, 20].  Caloric restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting (IF) have been reported to improve several risk factors for stroke and coronary artery diseases, including a reduction in blood pressure and increased insulin sensitivity [9, 10, 21]. However, taking into account the sleep restriction and nocturnal eating during Ramadan in Saudi Arabia, it is imperative to understand the effects of circadian rhythm alterations on various physiologic systems, and to estimate their possible contribution to the overall health and quality of life outcomes of Saudi Ramadan practitioners.",5f7353c6-b593-4297-96ee-30c1ec39fd9c
5,introduction5,"  The effects of disrupted sleep and feeding patterns during Ramadan on the expression of CLOCK, and glucocorticoid-controlled genes, such as Dual Specific Phosphatases (DUSP)1 and IL-1 have not been studied before. Therefore, we examined the changes in the diurnal expression of these three genes in healthy young Saudi adults before and two weeks into Ramadan. In addition, we investigated possible associations with selected cardiometabolic risk factors, both novel, such as Gamma glutamyl transferase (Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT)) and adiponectin, and traditional ones, such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), atherogenic index (AI), and the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-c:HDL-c ratio.

Blood samples were collected at 9 am (±1 hour) and twelve hours later for determination of serum lipid profile, high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), and adiponectin. The expression of CLOCK, Dual Specific Phosphatases (DUSP)1 and IL-1α was evaluated in circulating leukocytes.  Study design Full description of study design, as well as physiologic and anthropometric characteristics of the studied subjects were outlined in detail in our earlier report [14]. In summary, subjects were studied twice; before fasting during their regular life (Shaaban), and again 10–15 days after starting the fast (Ramadan).

Reference ranges for intended measurements, and laboratory quality control data were used to calculate sample size to avoid type II statistical error [22]. Twenty-three of the originally recruited healthy volunteer subjects (18 males, 5 females), aged 18–42 years completed the study. To avoid group variability at the study baseline the same subjects were studied at different times which also helped in decreasing the number of subjects needed. Subjects were instructed to have meals as usual on the day of testing, and to record their usual sleeping and waking times of the previous three days, thus helping to control for the effects of diet and sleep patterns on measured parameters.  Blood sampling was performed twice daily, at 9 am ± 1 hour and again twelve hours later.",67e13b14-7cae-44a9-8b89-9823f88811a6

16,discussion0,"It is believed that shift work uncouples the biological circadian clock and the external world zeitgebers, which, in turn, may contribute to shift-work associated diseases [11–13].  Similar to shift workers, Saudi adults practicing fasting during the month of Ramadan experience severe disturbance in their sleeping patterns. In our study we found profound changes in the diurnal expression of CLOCK,a central componenet of the circadian molecular clock, during Ramadan compared to the non-fasting month of Shabaan(Table 3, Fig 1A). In addition to the expected reversal of pattern, with a higher mean in the evening during Ramadan compared to a higher morning mean in Shabaan, a significant decrease in morning mean during Ramadan was noted compared to Shabaan. This is consistent with recent studies observing daily oscillation expression in peripheral tissues of some circadian CLOCK gens through transcriptional-translational feedback loops to control circadian rhythms [26].",b2af1cc7-40ec-49dd-b691-c6b8ad3e0205
17,discussion1," Indeed, several studies have also supported a significant cyclic rhythm of clock genes expression such as PER1, PER2,PER3, and BMAL1 in PBMCs of healthy subjects. This diurnal expression was characterized by a peak expression of the PER genes during the usual time of activity in the morning [26]. However, only a few of those studies have commented on CLOCK gene expression. In a study by Takata et al, human CLOCK gene expression in PBMCs from health volunteers exhibited no daily variations when compared to PER2 gene expression [27]. Moreover, it is worth noting that one limitation of the majority of these studies is the limited number of subjects examined.  In a mouse model that lacks a functional CLOCK, the loss of circadian function was associated with impaired glucose tolerance and insulin secretion resulting in a diabetic phenotype [28].",3ad87afd-e315-4142-9758-c04f048ada28
18,discussion2," Thus, our previously reported changes in insulin secretion patterns and increase in insulin resistance during Ramadan [14, 25], could be explained by the noted decrease in the morning and evening expression of CLOCK found in this study (Table 3, Fig 1A).  The peripheral CLOCK- mediated circadian acetylation of human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) act as target-tissue and their mechanism of action is diurnally fluctuating by cortisol which is high in morning and low at night [11, 12].  Evening elevations of cortisol as reported in Ramadan [14], and similar to that reported due to night-shift work are associated with uncoupling of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) CLOCK- directed HPA axis activity from the daily oscillation of target tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids, producing functional hypercortisolism and, hence, multiple components of the metabolic syndrome with resultant cardiovascular complications [12, 13, 22].",c8f111b7-5edb-4d97-a7b3-4d2982688835
19,discussion3," We have already reported deleterious changes in components of the metabolic syndrome during Ramadan, namely increases in triglycerides and decreases in HDL-c [14]. In this study, we calculated both low density lipoprotein (LDL)-c/ HDL-c ratio and AI; both cardiometabolic risk indicators reported to carry greater predictive value than isolated parameters used independently, particularly low density lipoprotein (LDL) [24, 29, 30]. Other studies in populations differing in ethnicity have confirmed their value [31, 32]. Therefore, our noted increase in the means of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-c/ HDL-c ratio and AI, during Ramadan further confirms the increased cardiometabolic risk compared to pre-fasting month.  Glucocorticoids were reported to upregulate the expression of Dual Specific Phosphatases (DUSP)1 gene [33], which could explain the upregulation of Dual Specific Phosphatases (DUSP) expression in the morning and evening during Ramadan in our study.",2a157961-f326-4cb8-a5d2-3730e9a920ad
20,discussion4," Dual Specific Phosphatases (DUSP) deactivates mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK)s [16], downregulating the innate immune response [17]. Therefore, the changes in Dual Specific Phosphatases (DUSP) expression could explain the downregulation in the expression of IL-1, which acts to activate both the innate and adaptive immune response [18]. Furthermore, it could explain our earlier reported lower mean IgG during Ramadan [34]. This is of particular importance to diabetics and the elderly possibly rendering them more susceptible to infectious diseases.  Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) is a common biomarker of liver injury and liver diseases. However, studies have also indicated that Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) might be an early marker of oxidative or other cellular stress, hence linking it to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension; perhaps as an oxidative stressor itself.",30860c0d-8b04-47cd-b418-fdb6f8e64939
21,discussion5," More recent studies reported a strong association between Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and hypertension and associated heart diseases [19]. Indeed, several studies and meta-analyses have showed positive correlations between Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome [19] [35]. In our study there was a noted decrease in the mean Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) during Ramadan, which could be explained by the effects of fasting [36], changes in dietary pattern [37] on protein synthesis in the liver, and/or changes in the pattern of cortisol secretion [33]. Whatever the cause, the lower mean during Ramadan might validate earlier reports of the cardiometabolic benefits of intermittent fasting [9, 10, 21].  CRP is a highly sensitive inflammatory marker that is produced mainly by the liver in response to infection, inflammation and trauma.",cd64cc59-f2b5-4d0a-b1a0-0ccfe6c251f8
22,discussion6," CRP is one of the acute phase proteins that plays an important role in host defense by binding to pathogens and damaged tissue, thus aiding their clearance [38, 39]. CRP can activate the complement system and bind to FC receptors leading to the generation of pro-inflammatory responses. Morning hsCRP levels are reported to be higher than those measured at midday or evening [28]. Circulating hsCRP levels are low in healthy individuals; however, levels can rapidly rise in response to inflammation, and similarly can rapidly decline following the resolution of the condition, making it an ideal marker to monitor various inflammatory conditions. In particular, hsCRP has been considered a marker of cardiovascular disorders, and has been linked to the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Disturbances in sleeping patterns were reported to increase CRP [40]. However, we found generally lower hsCRP values in Ramadan, accompanied by loss of the evening decrease noted in Shabaan.",7995756c-edf8-4272-80c7-4df60bfcc22b
23,discussion7," Such changes are beneficial and decrease cardiovascular risk [41]. Since the expression of CRP is mainly induced by IL-6, and enhanced by IL-1β [39], the noted decrease could be linked to decreased expression of IL-1 during Ramadan. Nevertheless, the earlier reported changes in cortisol secretion [14] could also play a role [33].  The circulating levels of the adipokine adiponectin have been reported to decrease insulin resistance [42], with its secretion by cultured adipocytes inhibited by pro-inflammatory cytokines [43]. Adiponectin has also been reported to be anti-atherogenic by: 1) regulating the main signaling pathways involved in the genesis of atherosclerosis [44], 2) suppressing monocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium [45], and 3) promoting angiogenesis in endothelial cells [46]. In addition, it has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties which may regulate steps in the atherogenic process [46].",cc3abe8d-d3f0-4dd9-9e3c-0ca2d8622ae1
24,discussion8," Moreover, adiponectin has been reported to inhibit macrophage conversion to foam cells, and to reduce oxidation of low density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) [47]. It has also been reported that decreased levels of adiponectin are associated with hypertension through various mechanisms [48]. Therefore, the dysregulation in adiponectin production may be an important factor in endothelial dysfunction, increasing the risk of CVD. Indeed, human studies have found that increased plasma adiponectin correlates with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction in men [49], and a lower risk of coronary heart disease in diabetics [50]. In our study, we noted a decrease in the mean morning level of adiponectin, with no significant difference between morning and evening level during Ramadan (Table 2). These changes were associated with increased insulin resistance [25], and could increase risk of CVD.",0e2f09f0-7f05-40e5-a52f-198fe5213822
25,discussion9," Unfortunately, we did not measure the possible effects on blood pressure or circulating adhesion molecules, however the increased low density lipoprotein (LDL)-c/HDL-c ratio and AI support our suggestion.  In conclusion, Ramadan fasting in Saudi Arabia is associated with improvements in certain cardiometabolic risk factors, such as Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), hsCRP and expression of IL 1, suggesting that intermittent fasting might be more beneficial than increased small meal frequency as suggested by some. However, it seems that the possibly intended benefits of intermittent fasting, as directed by religious teachings, may be offset by the dysregulation in the diurnal rhythm during Ramadan. This might partially explain the phenomenal increase in the prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus in Saudi Arabia.",aea19e62-cb6c-4726-9e22-3ce040f728b5
26,discussion10," Therefore, to maximize health benefits of IF, it is highly recommended to control the present day sleep disturbance during Ramadan. Firmer conclusions could be made if a similar study is carried out in a country in which sleep patterns are not affected during Ramadan.  Supporting information S1 Dataset Biochemical data.
