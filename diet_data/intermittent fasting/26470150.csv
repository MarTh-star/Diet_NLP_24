The experimental protocol comprised four testing phases: two weeks before Ramadan (pre-R), the end of the second week of Ramadan (R-2), the end of the fourth week of Ramadan (R-4), and 10 to 12 days after the end of Ramadan (post-R). During each phase, participants performed the 6MWT at approximately 15:00. HR (expressed as percentage of maximal predicted HR) and oxy-sat (%) were determined at rest and in each minute of the 6MWT.  Part of this study’s methodology was previously described in an article reporting on the effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on first-time fasting boys’ performance in short-term explosive exercises, as well as in sub-maximal endurance exercise.12 The major details concerning the applied methodology are presented below.",8751abcc-ff68-47f0-849f-495bfe565f16
1,methods1,"  Eighteen healthy non-athletic boys who fasted for the first time in their lives during Ramadan 2012 were included. The protocol was approved by the local hospital ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all children and their parents. The boys were asked to avoid strenuous activities 24 hours before each testing phase. Participants were informed that their participation was free of pressure and that they could withdraw from the study at any time (including that they could decide to stop fasting).  The experimental design consisted of four testing phases: two weeks before Ramadan (pre-R), the end of the second week of Ramadan (R-2), the end of the fourth week of Ramadan (R-4), and 10 to 12 days after the end of Ramadan (post-R). The decimal age (accuracy of 0.10 years) was calculated from the date of measurement and the date of birth.

During each testing phase, each boy performed one 6MWT.  The following data were collected/calculated: six-minute walking distance (6MWD, in m, % of predicted value27), oxy-sat (%) and HR [bpm, % of maximal predicted HR (= 208–0.7 × age)29] determined at rest and in each minute of the 6MWT, and the 6MWD × sixth minute oxy-sat index (m).17,18 The 6MWTs were performed according to international guidelines.30 At the end of the 6MWT, the 6MWD (m) was noted.

The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for normality revealed that the data were normally distributed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then conducted to compare the HR and oxy-sat data measured at the seven time points of the 6MWT (rest, first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth minutes) during the four testing phases. ANOVA was also conducted to compare the 6MWD × sixth minute oxy-sat index in the four phases. When appropriate, significant differences between means were tested using the Tukey post hoc test. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica software (Statistica Kernel version 6; StatSoft, Paris, France). Significance was set at p < 0.05. ",b674977e-4778-4441-abb0-e8f185f3ec62

6,results1,"1 It is important to know the effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on human physiology, not only for Muslim-majority countries but also for many countries where Muslims are in the minority.2 In a globalised society, physicians have to deal with issues such as Muslim patients who desire to fast during Ramadan, regardless of whether they are in good health or not.3  Several studies have assessed the effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on variables such as body mass, biological data or markers, and sleep patterns in healthy adult subjects.2,4-10 However, only a few studies have been performed on healthy children.11-14 This lack of information on the effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on the health and physical performance of healthy children could lead to confusion worldwide. For example, on 10 June, one week before the start of Ramadan in 2015, the Barclay Primary School in east London, UK, sent a letter to the parents of its students (http://www.telegraph.",d0b44479-98f2-41ea-8e50-0f9230532569

In children, the evaluation of heart rate (HR) and/or oxyhaemoglobin saturation (oxy-sat) dynamics during exercise provides valuable information for making management decisions, resulting in improved quality of life and functional capacity.15,16 During exercise, HR responses reflect subjects’ physical level and aerobic fitness.17,18 To the best of our knowledge, to date, all studies interested in the effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on HR changes concern adults19-25 and none has been performed in children.",6cec2d68-74a3-49f2-a824-6a4235cb4c6d

They discussed in detail the required sample size, study design, 6MWT choice and procedures.26  Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) is not obligatory for pre-pubescent children, and many observe it from early adolescence.12,26 However, even though Islam requires such a practice only after puberty, it is a relatively frequent practice that pre-pubescent children attempt to fast the whole of Ramadan.12,26  Effect of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on HR Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) seemed to have a significant effect on HR, determined during the 6MWT.",209ea919-4fdb-450f-a352-8ae028ff30b9

To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the impact of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on the HR of healthy children.  Our results are in line with those observed in some studies conducted on adults,19,24 but opposite to those of Zerguini et al.25 Husain et al.19 showed that resting HR in adults was markedly lowered in sedentary fasting male subjects (aged 20–45 years) during the month of Ramadan, while responses in females were only slightly decreased.

16,discussion4,"  There are three possible explanations as to how the decrease in HR during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) could be explained: • significant reduction in endurance capacity during Ramadan.12 In a previous study, it was shown that the 6MWD was lower during R-4 compared to pre-R but returned to baseline values post-R. Therefore, the Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF)-induced attenuation of HR during walking tests should be taken into consideration when assessing human exercise capacity, applying the HR output relationship.  • changes in lifestyle during Ramadan.12 This mainly impacts on the schedule of food intake, which may affect HR32 Indeed, fasting lowers the metabolic rate due to the absence of digestion, which increases HR for two or three hours during the day.33 The possible role of plasma leptin and ghrelin concentrations (i.e.",33cc227a-1835-44cd-b378-c5f71ac8a2fb
17,discussion5," satiety and hunger hormones, respectively, known to affect cardiovascular activity34,35) as an explanation of HR reduction was rejected by Zoladz et al.,36 who found no effect of the overnight fast on pre- and during-exercise plasma leptin and ghrelin concentrations. However, this may be due to the relatively short duration of fasting in their study compared to Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF).37, 38 This possible explanation should be considered in future studies.  • reduced sympathetic tone during fasting.19 Zoladz et al.36 demonstrated a significant decrease in HR by about 10 bpm after an overnight fast. Their most likely explanation was the observed significant increase in plasma norepinephrine concentration, leading to an increase in systemic vascular resistance, loading of arterial baroreceptors, and causing vagal stimulation.39,40     The validity of the above explanations, taken from studies done in adults, should be demonstrated in children.",a7883403-20d7-4587-890e-a9b930a4e431
18,discussion6,"  Effect of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on oxy-sat Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) seemed to have a statistically significant effect on oxy-sat determined during the third and fifth minutes of the 6MWT. R-2 oxy-sat values were higher than those of pre-R (third minute) and post-R (fifth minute), and post-R values were lower than those of pre-R and R-4 (fifth minute). These significant changes between phases were approximately five points (Fig. 2), and could not be considered clinically significant since that requires a change of more than five points.17,18,27 Therefore Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) slightly improved blood oxygenation and oxygen transport by haemoglobin, suggesting that the haemoglobin affinity with oxygen may have increased.41,42  Recently, a novel desaturation index (6MWD × oxy-sat) has been proposed, with the objective of improving the information obtained from the 6MWT.17,18 In our study, this index was lower during R-4 compared to pre-R (Fig. 3).",57ad6bb8-1c9b-45af-b12f-2e1aa5f6121d
19,discussion7," However, during the four testing phases, the desaturation index was in the normal range (minimum–maximum: 32 305–78 720). In chronic respiratory dysfunction patients, a low 6MWD × oxy-sat product (e.g. 20 000 m) was related to a clearly increased hazard ratio for mortality,43 and it predicted quality of life.44  The rationale for HR and oxy-sat measurements in non-diseased children deals with children’s safety. For instance, during school sports practice late in the afternoon, especially when Ramadan occurs in summer, the length of the fast could potentially be a concern with young fasting children. Moreover, such information could help medical and educational authorities to make rational decisions concerning banning/allowing the practice of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on school grounds.",a28fc47e-b01d-42c2-a54a-462784b5fb56
20,discussion8," It is of paramount importance to note that banning of such a religious practice could trigger sharp reactions from the concerned communities; therefore, any potential banning has to be based on sound and powerful data.  Limitations The main limitation of the present study, as observed in previous ones on Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) effects on the physical capacities of healthy children,11-14,26 was the absence of a non-fasting control group. The inclusion of such a group may decrease the risk of learning effects skewing the findings, and circumvent any hazard to the internal strength of the results.12,26 This crucial point was previously discussed.12,26 The second limitation was not measuring the walked distance in each minute of the 6MWT. Therefore, the correlation between HR and the 6MWD in each minute of the 6MWT was not studied. However, as recommended, the boys were invited to walk as far as possible in six minutes along a flat hallway.",21e5c2b7-cf7e-4d99-8982-81c2d85db869
21,discussion9,"30 In addition, none of them needed to rest since they knew how to pace themselves, based on pre-experiment tests.12,30  Conclusion This study shows that summer Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) observed for the first time by non-athletic boys aged 12 years had a minimal effect on oxy-sat but significantly impaired HR during the 6MWT.
