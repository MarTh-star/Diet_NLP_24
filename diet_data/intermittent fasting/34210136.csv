0,methods0," Participants  After receiving a thorough explanation of the protocol, twenty-four (male; body mass index of ≥30 kg·m-2) adolescents with obesity gave their written consent to voluntarily participate in this study. They were recruited from schools, community events, health clinics and social media sites. Throughout the study period, participants were asked to maintain as closely as possible the same dietary (in term of quantity and quality) and usual sleep habits (in term of total sleep time). All participants didn't have a history of cardiovascular diseases or diabetes, they are non-smokers and they didn't consume caffeine, drugs, or alcoholic beverages. They were randomly (i.e., coin flip) divided into two groups of twelve participants: a control group (CG; age: 16.25 ± 0.8 y, height: 1.65 ± 0.3 m) and an experimental group (EG; age: 15.75 ± 0.8 y, height: 1.67 ± 0.2 m) (Figure 1).",44b38aa5-888f-443f-9b8f-d908dc24bcd6
1,methods1," The protocol was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration for human experimentation and was approved by the university ethics committee.  Figure 1 Flow chart of participant's recruitment.  Experimental Design  The study took place in Tunisia during Ramadan of the 2018 year, which occurred, from the 16th of May to the 14th June. During this month participants were allowed to eat from sunset (i.e., ~19:15 h−19:45 h) to 03:00 h (i.e., time of the last meal). The length of each fasting day was ~16 h. Participants of the EG participated in cooperative exergaming for an average of 45 min per day during 5 days per week while they practice Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF). All exergames sessions were performed in the afternoon hours (from 17:00 h). This period of the day was selected as it represent an usual time of exercise and training for adolescents (i.e., after the end of school times) (16).",b715d82b-adde-40df-949d-9ba8b3dedaea
2,methods2," The CG completed his fasting rituals during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) without additional exercise. Participants were controlled with a fitness coach (telehealth coaching) and video chat during all exergames sessions. Based on a previous study, cooperative exergame were chosen for the current study (15). Cooperative exergame play produced higher intrinsic motivation to play the exergame. Cooperative exergame is a fitness video game involving gross motor movement to engage youth with overweight and obesity in sustained physical activity and provide intrinsic motivation (15). Sports games were used in all sessions. Players cooperate in a team dyad to earn points. All measurements were obtained 1 week before the start of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) (T0), on the 15th day of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) (T1), on the end of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) (T2), and 1 week after Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) (T3).",1e31738a-d52c-41ce-9827-58fc6c0a0c3a
3,methods3," Participants were fully familiarized with the tests prior to all procedures (17). Body-mass measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 kg with an electronic balance (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan) at T0, T1, T2, and T3 under the same conditions and the same time of day. The BMI was calculated as follows: BMI (kg/m2) = weight (kg)/height2 (m2). The waist circumference (WC) was also measured. The central obesity index was calculated as the ratio between WC and height in centimeters (18).  During each measurement period, participants completed the profile of mood state (profile of mood states (POMS)), the 6-min walking test (6MWT), the vertical jump test (SJ) and the 10 and 30m sprint tests. Before and immediately following the 6MWT, diastolic (diastolic (DBP)) and systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) were recorded. The cardiovascular parameters were recorded using an electronic wrist blood pressure monitor (Microlife, W90, Paris) (19).",d73e6c61-6f82-4706-888f-567e1c50f9be
4,methods4," The rating of perceived exertion (rating of perceived exertion (RPE)) was recorded following the 6MWT. Blood samples were taken at rest and at the end of the 6MWT. Dietary intake was recorded every day for 1 week during each period. The safety fasting program of this procedure was assessed by collecting daily all self-reported and observed symptoms, as well as the rated perceived exertion after exergaming.  The ambient temperature and humidity were presented in Supplementary Table A1.  Assessment of Dietary Intake  Food record was carried out to evaluate the energy intake (i.e., fat, protein, and carbohydrate) during each day and for 1 week in all periods. All participants received a detailed verbal explanation and written instructions about their diet habit recording. Food records were self-reported and the provided information was assessed by an experienced nutritionist. The daily nutritional intake were calculated using dietary assessment software Nutrisoft-Bilnut (ver.",8b9a18c9-0fdb-4fd9-922b-a7d1d492ec06

The Profile of Mood States (profile of mood states (POMS))  The questionnaire was used when the participants came to the experimental session. The profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire developed by McNair et al. (20) was used to collect data about the mood of participants during T0, T1, T2 and T3. The French version validated by Cayrou et al. (21) was used in the present study. The profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire is a self-report questionnaire consisting of 65 items taht measure different emotional conditions (i.e., including negative moods (tension-anxiety, depression, anger-hostility, fatigue and confusion-bewilderment), one positive mood (vigor-activity) and interpersonal relationships). Five-point Likert scales ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 4 (“extreme”), in relation to the context of each item, were used.",ece97580-1367-4e50-8c55-0b2f777bb59d

Participants were instructed to walk back and forth along a 30 m corridor the longest distance possible within 6 min. During the test, no hopping, skipping, sprinting, or jumping were permitted. The participants were only given standardized encouragement (e.g., “go head”) and an announcement of the remaining time (23).  Rating of Perceived Exertion (rating of perceived exertion (RPE))  The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale allows participants to rate their level of exertion for a given physical task. At the end of the 6MWT, the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was recorded using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale (24). The level of exertion ranges from 6 to 20.",145e1231-cc73-4611-bf8a-129c2f342618
7,methods7,"  Sprint of 10 and 30 m  The sprint performance was evaluated for 10 m and 30 m distances. The subjects started from a standing position and the sprint time was registered with photo-electric cells positioned at the start line and at 10 and 30 m. The photoelectric cells were placed at shoulder height. Each subject performed two tests and the best time was registered for the analysis.  Squat Jump  Maximal vertical jump was conducted by asking the participant to start in a squat position and, after a brief pause, to jump upwards as quickly and as high as possible. The test was performed using an optojump device (optojump, Microgate, Bolzano, Italy) interfaced with a microcomputer. Prior to jumping upwards, no downwards motion was permitted. Participants were instructed to keep their hands on the hips and to limit lateral and horizontal displacements throughout the jumps.",f00ce0db-f510-4de0-9f26-a09db6b96b23
8,methods8,"  Blood Samples and Analyses  Five milliliter of venous blood samples were taken with venous catheters at rest and at the end of the 6MWT. Venous blood was centrifuged (for 20 min at 2,500 rpm at room temperature) to separate the erythrocytes from the plasma and was frozen and stored at −80°C until analysis. Each blood sample was analyzed using an automated cell counter (ABX Micros 60 impedance analyzer) for the measurement of WBC, RBC, HCT and PLT. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Low-density lipoprotein (Low density lipoprotein (LDL)) and High-density lipoprotein (High density lipoprotein (HDL)) were measured using a colorimetric enzymatic assay: homogeneous phase direct test (liquicolor) (Kit, HUMAN, Ref: 10084: Gesellschaft für Biochemica und Diagnostica mbH Wiesbaden, Germany). The sensibility was 1.1 mg/dl and the coefficient of variation was 1.25 %.

The calculation of the optical density of the samples was carried out at a wavelength of 505 nm.  Statistical Analysis  All statistical tests were processed using STATISTICA software (StatSoft, Statistica, V10). Means ± Standard Errors (M ± ES) were used in text, tables and figures. The normality of the distribution was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk W test. The software G*Power (25) was used a priori to calculate the necessary minimum sample size, based on procedures suggested by Beck (26). Values for α were set at 0.05 and power at 0.80. Based on an earlier study (27), the effect sizes were estimated as 0.39 and the analysis revealed a sample size of 10 participants per group were considered sufficient to reduce the risk of type 2 statistical error.",a0786c61-4985-4209-bad0-7c83a78e5b4d

15,discussion0," In the present study, there was a significant decrease in body weight during compared to out of Ramadan in the EG and the CG. These findings could be related to the Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF)'s health benefits. This is consistent with the result of a review of 70 published studies that showed a reduction in weight, body mass and fat percentage in fasted people with obesity (8). Previous reports showed that weight loss during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) was due to the reduced food intake (2). Therefore, this could, in part, explain the observed weight loss in the present study. Furthermore, a previous study showed that anaerobic performance did not change throughout this month (16). Nevertheless, others studies reported that Ramadan negatively affect the short-term maximal (28, 29) and the repeated sprint (30) performances. These divergences may be due to the characteristics of the participants (participants with obesity vs. participants with normal weight) (31).",f1f62de1-cf05-4434-b4db-aba20ee17eac
16,discussion1,"  The current study indicated that there are differences between groups in favor of those who practice exergaming in BMI and body fat. This result is consistent with a previous report (32) that found a reduction in body weight and waist and hip circumferences in school students with obesity who participated in exergaming. However, no change was observed in CG during all periods. In accordance with previous report, the change in BMI was observed in physically active participants (33). Trepanowski and Bloomer (34) revealed a reduction of body weight due to the decreased total amount of food consumed per day and the practice of physical activity during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) (however, in the present study, no dietary changes was observed). In the CG, physical inactivity can explain, in part, the unchanged BMI and body fat. Also, Andrade et al. (35) reported that exergames enhance positive mood states and physical activity and decrease fatigue.",8af36b4c-4a6b-463c-8bf8-3c1c4b5a1799
17,discussion2," The effectiveness of exergaming on physical appearance and weight is related to the availability and attractiveness of these games, which made them stimulating movement (36) and affects cognitive aspects (37). Moreover, the present findings showed a significant decrease during Ramadan (i.e., at T2) of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scores and sort-term maximal performance (i.e., SJ) in EG. These results could be due to changes in body composition as well as psychological responses in participants with obesity. Exergaming led to a development of positive self-esteem, an improvement in physical performance and cognitive function and an enhancement of perceived physical values of participants with obesity (38).  Several studies supported the positive effect of Ramadan fasting on psychological states and well-being (39, 40).",5ad087d3-276c-4c66-9911-012974b9245f
18,discussion3," To the best of the author's knowledge, the findings of the current study are the first to assess the impact of exergaming on psychological indices in adolescents with obesity during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF). The results showed a positive effect of exergaming on mood states and perceived effort in adolescents with obesity during Ramadan, which is consistent with a previous research demonstrating the positive psychological effects of exergaming during Ramadan (41). Further, compared with CG, adolescents in the exergaming condition decreased their rating of perceived exertion (RPE). rating of perceived exertion (RPE) is mediated by psychological factors during exercise (42, 43). Previous studies showed that the relation between lactate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) after training reflects peripheral metabolic adaptations that collectively attenuate rating of perceived exertion (RPE) (44, 45).",04c783b5-333d-4f24-a3ba-6aab660c7438
19,discussion4," These peripheral adaptations were detected after 3 weeks of exergaming training. These results can explain, in part, the decreased scores of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) in participants with obesity (46). Viana and de Lira (47) showed a positive impact of exergaming on mental health (reducing social isolation and anxiety disorders). Improvements observed in the current study may help set the stage for future weight-loss interventions for these adolescents. In the same context, exergaming has a positive effect on psychological function and perceived competence to continue exercise in adolescents with obesity during Ramadan (48).  In the present study, TC and TG were lower in the exergaming group at the end of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF). Additionally, the WBC count, RBC and HCT% were not significantly affected by Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) in both groups.",c97f0faa-ff60-4c3a-8e52-052075ff3262
20,discussion5," Considering diverse benefits of fasting, caloric restriction and fasting has been acknowledged to improve several biochemical parameters in participants with obesity. This result is consistent with Kul et al. (49) who indicated a substantial reduction in total cholesterol, Low density lipoprotein (LDL) and TG levels in males with obesity during Ramadan fasting. Thus, exergaming may explain the significant decrease of TC and TG in CG. In accordance, it has been reported that exergaming has a positive effect on improving systolic blood pressure (SBP), DPB, total cholesterol and Low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in children with obesity (50). In the same context, a significant improvement was observed on cardiometabolic values in response to home-based exergaming intervention among overweight and children with obesity (51). In our study, the results revealed no changes in Low density lipoprotein (LDL) and High density lipoprotein (HDL).",7b8b95cb-571e-4905-9d8c-bddb129a52fe
21,discussion6," A previous study reported no significant differences for High density lipoprotein (HDL)-C, Low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, and TG in participants with normal/-weight and obesity following Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) (52). On the contrary, a previous study observed reductions in concentrations of blood glucose and High density lipoprotein (HDL), and increases in Low density lipoprotein (LDL) in healthy individuals during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) (53). The discrepancies could be related to differences in subjects' characteristics.  Changes in anthropometric and biochemical parameters depend on the physical activity and exercise level, body weight and biochemical responses of participants (33). Hence, the changes that occurred following 30 days of fasting were not sufficient to affect biochemical values in the CG. Differences between CG and EG in the results of TC and TG may be related to the exergaming practice.  Study Limitations  Some limitations are to be noted.",ed93eaa3-92c6-420b-bce8-ea486f8c3a77
22,discussion7," The liberty of choosing the exergames made it difficult to determine which games are most valuable to adolescents with obesity. Overall, multiple follow-up measurements are required in future studies. Otherwise, the intensity of exergames was not controlled in the present study and should be registered for future investigations.  Conclusion and Practical Application  The combined effect of Ramadan intermittent fasting and exergaming represents an excellent opportunity to initiate healthy lifestyle and to lose weight in adolescents with obesity. Thus, intermittent fasting and exergaming could be a potent strategy for adolescents with obesity. In general, exergaming, as physical exercise, and intermittent fasting, as a nutritional behavior, could be beneficial for health.
