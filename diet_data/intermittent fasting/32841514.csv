0,methods0," 2.1. Research Design  The current research employed a two-group non-randomized quasi-experimental controlled design and was conducted in the month of Ramadan (1441 Hijri), which was between 23 April 2020 and 23 May 2020. To support the organizing and reporting, the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Non-randomized Designs (Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Non randomized Designs (TREND)) statement was utilized [20].  2.2. Ethical Issues  The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the research ethics committee in secondary health care, Ministry of Health, Bahrain (approval code MOH/SHCREC/EF0215). Written informed consent was requested and acquired from each participant before registration in the study. All procedures performed in this study followed the ethical standards of the Ministry of Health research committee and the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.  2.3.",b3df5ee4-436b-4794-9350-c73bd00df3ae
1,methods1," Setting, Participants, Group Assignment, and Sample Size Calculation  Outpatient participants were recruited from the outpatient clinic, Psychiatric Hospital, Ministry of Health, Bahrain. The Psychiatric Hospital is the national and only public center for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of cases with serious mental illnesses in the Kingdom of Bahrain.  This study involved male patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) according to the clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines of the classification of mental and behavioral disorders chapter within the international classification of disease version 10 (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10) [21]. Female patients were not included because Muslim women are exempted from RF during the period of menses, thus making fasting days interrupted. Other inclusion criteria were adults aged between 20 and 64 years of age, competent to provide informed consent, and willing to participate.",c5e5a146-0606-4827-a07c-ae53a04f47d6
2,methods2," We excluded patients with a medical excuse from fasting, those who were dieting, those following a lifestyle management program, or those involved in other interventional studies.  Participants were assigned to the study groups using a non-randomized approach. Before enrollment to groups, patients were asked if they were planning “intentions” to fast for Ramadan by the principal investigator, and their answer determined assignment to the fasting group (FG) vs. non-fasting group (non fasting group (NFG)). Group assignment was further validated before data collection based on participants’ initial report. The FG served as the intervention, and the non fasting group (NFG) was considered as the control.

3,methods3,"  Using sample size calculations for non-randomized studies, we projected that 35 participants are needed per group to provide 80% power to reveal a significant difference of one kilogram in body mass difference between groups using an independent samples t-test with an alpha of 0.05. The anticipated change in body mass of approximately one kilogram (an effect size of 0.20) after fasting is based on findings of a recent systematic review and meta-analysis [12]. To account for any potential loss of follow-up during the study, we assumed a 30% dropout rate, and this aimed to include 50 patients per group at the start of the study.  2.4. Measurements/Endpoints  Data were collected from each participant at baseline (T1 = one week before the month of Ramadan) and after fasting (T2 = after completing 28 days of the fasting month).",b4223004-ce40-4d11-916c-458fff09d409
4,methods4," The daily fasting time was approximately 870 min from 03:40 to 18:10 (14 h and 30 min) per day according to Umm Al-Qura calculation methods of Muslim prayers for Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain. No specific dietary, physical activities or other lifestyle modification suggestions were given during the study period.  All measurements were facilitated by a single-blinded research assistant. Data collection forms included the following items: sociodemographic variables (at T1 only), an assessment of physical activity (PA) (at T1 only), assessment of depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (at T1, T2), anthropometric and direct-segmental, multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)) (at T1, T2), blood pressure (at T1, T2), lipid profile (at T1, T2), and finally fasting blood sugar (fasting blood sugar (FBS)) (at T1, T2).",dcd67960-d953-41fb-9283-a003ce3703f2
5,methods5,"  Sociodemographic variables and assessment of PA included age, sex, marital status, employment status, smoking status, and level of physical activity engagement. PA was measured using the validated outcome measure International Physical Activity Questionnaire—Short Form (IPAQ-SF) [22]. The IPAQ-SF evaluates the frequency and duration of light-, moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA. The total metabolic equivalent task (metabolic equivalent task (MET)) per minute/week was computed accordingly, and patients were considered to be minimally active if they met 600 metabolic equivalent task (MET) min/week, and individuals with 3000 metabolic equivalent task (MET) minutes/week are considered to be Health-Enhancing Physical Activity (Health Enhancing Physical Activity (HEPA)) active [22]. The Arabic language validated short version was used (http://www.ipaq.ki.se, accessed on 6 January 2020).  The PHQ-9 [23] was used to measure self-reported depressive symptoms.",23448a2b-59a0-4223-b051-320e98a9aff5
6,methods6," The PHQ-9 has a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression disorders at 10 points [23]. The Arabic language validated version of the PHQ-9 [24] was used. The severity of depressive symptoms was determined using the PHQ-9 using the following scores: 0–4 no depressive symptoms, 5–9 mild depression, 10–14 moderate depression, 15–19 moderately severe depression, 20–27 severe depression [23].  Anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) included body mass (kg), height (cm), waist circumference (cm), hip circumference (cm), lean mass (kg), fat mass (kg), total body water percent (%), and percent body fat (%). Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was estimated in kg/m2 by dividing the weight (kg) by the squared height (m) for each person [25]. The waist–hip ratio (waist–hip ratio (WHR)) was estimated by dividing the waist circumference (cm) by the hip circumference (cm).",ae8d595d-9bf7-4b47-aacf-4c3d16622382
7,methods7," The waist circumference was defined as the total distance of the lower margin of the last palpable ribs and the top of the iliac crest, using a stretch-resistant tape. Hip circumference is the total distance around the widest portion of the buttocks, with the tape parallel to the floor [26]. bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was performed using InBody 770 (InBody, CA, USA).  Before completing the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements, all accessories, metals, and/or jewelry were removed following the manufacturer’s recommendations, and each participant was asked to eliminate extra body fluids by urine. The influence of hydration and physical exertion on bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measures was reduced since all individuals fasted for eight to ten hours before each of the two time periods, decreasing intra-individual variability.",7a46fc61-5d82-4699-957a-52d984a65f6c
8,methods8," Furthermore, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and all other parameters were collected at the same time of day for T1 and T2.  After ten minutes of rest, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate were monitored using a digital blood pressure monitor (Dräger, Vista 120, Lübeck, Germany), with individuals in a sitting position. Mean arterial pressure (Mean arterial pressure (MAP)) was computed using the following formula: ((systolic blood pressure (SBP)) + (2 × DBP))/3 [27].  After assessing blood pressure, samples of venous blood (10 mL) were taken. To reduce the influence of time on the assessed variables, venipuncture collection was performed after eight to ten hours of fasting at both time periods. Blood lipid profile and fasting blood sugar (FBS) were measured.",78a18d8a-62ec-4210-914c-1a897c0cb263
9,methods9," The lipid profile included total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (high density lipoprotein (HDL)), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL)), and triglycerides (TG). The blood lipid profile and fasting blood sugar (FBS) were analyzed using Simens Dimension EXL 200 and Simens ADIVA Chemistry XPT (Simens, Munich, Germany).  The Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was essential to calculate the metabolic syndrome z-score based on the methodology proposed by the Division of Cardiology at Duke University [28]. However, in the current research, we used the new world-wide definition of metabolic syndrome presented by the International Diabetes Federation (International Diabetes Federation (IDF)) [29,30]. The z-score was calculated for each patient using his data, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria, and the standard deviation of the entire data. The equation used was: z-score = [((1.03 − high density lipoprotein (HDL))/0.",1e5d83ff-365d-4542-9070-128dbd5f76b6

Negative z-scores (and negative z-score changes) are indicative of lower risk [28]. Supplemental Table S1 provides a summary of the study parameters and an interpretation key.  2.5. Statistical Analyses  Before the start of data analyses, the data were visualized using histograms and box plots to check normality and identify any potential outliers. The Shapiro–Wilk test was deployed to formally test the normality of the study variables. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data and involved mean and standard deviation (for continuous variables) and absolute and relative frequencies (for categorical data).  Paired samples t-test was used to compare the difference in the study variables before and after fasting. The independent samples t-test was used to compare the change (before–after) between participants in the fasting group vs.",2c839008-18dc-46af-b13d-bc9be2247d2a
11,methods11," participants in the non fasting group (NFG). The effect size was estimated via Cohen’s d and was interpreted as follows: 0.20 as small, 0.50 as moderate, ≥0.80 as large [31]. For a comparison of two means, Cohen’s d is an acceptable effect size. It can be used to complement the reporting of t-test and ANOVA results [31]. Cohen’s d represented the standardized mean difference between two groups by subtracting one group’s mean from the other’s (M1—M2) and dividing the result by the population’s standard deviation (SD) [31].  Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used as a general linear model approach to examine the magnitude of change within FG vs. non fasting group (NFG) in the significant study parameters covarying for marital status, employment status, smoking status, and psychotropic medication (as factors) and age, physical activity, baseline body mass, and baseline PHQ-9. Post hoc comparisons are based on estimated marginal means using Tukey correction.",dbed6e3f-d6af-43dd-8ac4-ddfc663ef152
12,methods12," We used two-tailed tests, and results with p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using R for statistical computing 4.0.3 [32].  3. Results  One hundred male patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were involved in this study. The mean age was 46 ± 10 years of age, and about 50% were married, 60% unemployed, 35% current smokers, and more than 60% were physically inactive with an average of 740 metabolic equivalent task (MET) min/week. All patients were on pharmacological treatment for depression at the time of the study. The antidepressants used were: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (51%), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (32%), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (11%), and atypical antidepressants (6%). The fasting and non-fasting groups were similar in their characteristics, suggesting that the two groups are comparable.",5f5d97ef-24f8-4933-8ebb-8af291a3b55e
13,methods13," Table 1 provides the baseline socio-demographics of the study participants. At baseline, the majority of our patients were in the moderately severe depression group (PHQ-9 ≥ 14); specifically, 88% and 86% were in that category for the FG and non fasting group (NFG), respectively.  The FG had statistically significant changes in nine parameters, including PHQ-9, body mass, Body mass index (BMI), BSA, %BF, LM, high density lipoprotein (HDL), TG, and WC, after four weeks of fasting. The non fasting group (NFG) had statistically significant changes in seven parameters, including PHQ-9, body mass, Body mass index (BMI), BSA, %BF, TBWP, LM, and WC, after four weeks of follow-up (see Table 2).  Fasting produced a statistically significant reduction in PHQ-9, body mass, Body mass index (BMI), BSA, BFP, and high density lipoprotein (HDL). Nonetheless, fasting also resulted in a significant loss of LM.",fccaea51-5247-4b1d-bbe4-8f718e8e357a
14,methods14," Improvements in central obesity and high density lipoprotein (HDL) did not alter the MS z-score in the FG compared to the non fasting group (NFG) p = 0.85 (see Table 3).  Results from the ANCOVA suggest that fasting did not affect depressive symptoms—the mean difference of PHQ-9 was 0.49 (SE = 0.63), p = 0.436, Cohen ES = 0.17. However, fasting produced a large change in the following: body mass 1.86 kg (SE = 0.06), p = 0.001, Cohen ES = 6.35; Body mass index (BMI) 0.69 kg/m2 (SE = 0.03), p = 0.001, Cohen ES 5.23; BFP 0.91% (SE = 0.09), p = 0.001, Cohen ES = 2.09; BSA 0.03 m2 (SE = 0.01), p = 0.001, Cohen ES 0.81; LM 0.79 kg (SE = 0.10), p = 0.001, Cohen ES = 1.63 (see Table 4).  4. Discussion  Four weeks of intermittent fasting during the month of Ramadan performed by male Muslim patients with depression did not exacerbate depressive symptoms. The fasting produced a significant loss in body mass and body fat.",4d7e1a24-e731-4b5c-b9ce-273a82717d30
15,methods15," RF appears to be safe for psychiatric symptoms and apparently beneficial for physical health for those individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Clinicians need to provide advice to their patients on RF and other forms of intermittent fasting after a thorough assessment of their patient’s psychiatric and medical condition. Frequent follow-ups as continued care with patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) during Ramadan fasting are encouraged.  Our data showed that no significant changes in self-reported depression scores were observed after RF. A limited number of studies have assessed the effect of RF on depressive symptoms in patients with psychiatric conditions and reported a marginal improvement in mood and emotional response [10]. On the other hand, a few studies assessed the impact of experimental or RF on mood and reported conflicting results [9,10,33].",548af51a-d28a-4932-bad3-4c5941b149c1
16,methods16," These discrepancies in the reported results could be related to the assessment method used to evaluate the changes in depressive symptoms or severity. Previous studies relied mainly on patients’ reports or clinical interviews and lacked the use of a reliable and valid outcome measure of depressive symptoms [9,11]. The deterioration in depressive symptoms observed in the non-fasting group can possibly be explained by the fact that previous studies in healthy people [34] and patients with diabetes [35] showed that fasting can lead to an improvement in stress scores, which may explain our findings.  Additionally, data extrapolated from clinical and pre-clinical caloric restriction (CR) studies indicated that short-term CR protocols might induce an antidepressant effect [7].",d2fb6942-f84d-49a3-9d44-5500fd955870
17,methods17," Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antidepressant effects of CR, including orexin signaling activation, increased cAMP responsive element binding (CREB) (cAMP response element-binding) phosphorylation, and the neurotrophic effects of the release of endorphins and ketone production [36,37,38].  Body mass loss and body fat reduction after RF were previously reported with a similar magnitude in two systematic reviews and meta-analyses of healthy individuals [12,39]. Weight loss and loss of fat-free mass and body fat percentage after RF were observed at higher magnitudes in overweight or obese individuals [39]. Our participants were mostly overweight or obese at baseline, and this may explain why they experienced the benefit of fasting at a pronounced magnitude.  Another interesting finding of the current study is that body mass loss did not reduce the overall risk for MS and related metabolic markers.",9e847f20-8914-40d5-b4bf-5e5ba902adc1
18,methods18," Previous research showed that patients with depression had an increased risk of MS compared to age- and sex-matched controls [40], and lifestyle interventions are needed. Powered, controlled, longitudinal studies demonstrating the long-term benefits of RF (or other forms of intermittent fasting) on body mass and its impact on MS and related metabolic abnormalities in clinically depressed individuals are encouraged.  Another finding by our research is that almost half of the weight loss was in lean mass. This is in disagreement with RF in healthy participants fasting for approximately 17 h per day [41]. However, our findings are consistent with the findings of a recent randomized clinical controlled trial of the 16:8 diet (proxy to Ramadan fast), and suggest that time-restricted feeding and intermittent fasting cause a significant loss in lean mass in overweight and obese individuals [42].",5f37e1c8-de9e-45ba-9c96-5c9d90ca92fa
19,methods19," This is a source of concern because muscle loss may affect power, mobility, and metabolic health [43,44]. Monitoring physical activity thresholds and protein intake during future controlled trials is needed to examine the covariate nature of these two factors on lean mass, as previous studies have reported changes in dietary contents during Ramadan [45,46].  The current paper has strengths and limitations. The major strength includes being the first study to investigate the effects of RF on depressive symptoms, weight loss, MS and related metabolic abnormalities, and body composition in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) using multifaceted methodologies that assessed both mental and physical health. As a non-randomized approach was used, the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Non randomized Designs (TREND) statement was deployed to mitigate concerns with bias.",08f29c62-da12-454b-91d9-67e3f593e011
20,methods20," Future randomized studies are needed to eliminate the bias of the self-selection of fasting as an intervention. Randomization is truly unfeasible in studies investigating religious types of fasting [47]; nonetheless, more rigorous research is needed.  The limitations include the lack of objective measurement of physical activity and sleep duration and timing as potential covariates for the study parameters. Thus, future studies need to include the objective measurement of physical activities and sleep using actigraphy or wearable devices, and they need to record the food intake and control for them in the analyses. Another limitation is the lack of follow-up measurements after RF to better understand the nature of changes. Such long-term follow-up studies need to also account for the daily estimated energy intake, resting energy expenditure, and total energy expenditure.  5.",1a1b41c9-e210-4f3c-a6f7-0a6dac3cb319
21,methods21," Conclusions  Four weeks of intermittent fasting during the month of Ramadan performed by Muslim patients with depression did not exacerbate depressive symptoms. RF was associated with a significant loss in body mass and body fat, suggesting that RF is potentially safe and likely beneficial for males with major depressive disorder (MDD). Further research is needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of fasting for people with depression.
