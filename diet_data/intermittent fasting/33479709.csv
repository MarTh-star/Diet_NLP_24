3,methods3,"  Randomisation and study overview  Participants who were eligible for the study were stratified by age, sex and body mass index (BMI) before being randomised by coin toss into either the intermittent fasting plus training (intermittent fasting plus training (IFT)) or continuous energy restriction plus training (continuous energy restriction plus training (CERT)) groups for 12 weeks. The random allocation sequence was not explicitly concealed. Participants in the intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) group undertook a 5:2 style-fasting protocol, while those in the continuous energy restriction plus training (CERT) group undertook a continuous energy restriction style feeding pattern. Both groups completed supervised resistance training twice per week, and resistance/aerobic combination training once per week. The intervention took place from February to November 2019, spread across 6 groups, starting 2–4 weeks apart.",18923ab9-3945-4d6e-9472-aa095704b3f9
4,methods4," A flow chart showing participant movement through the study can be seen in Fig. 1. This study was approved by the Swinburne University of Technology Human Research Ethics Committee (project #2018/322).Fig. 1 Participant flow diagram  Diet protocol  Basal energy requirements for all participants were calculated using the Mifflin St. Jeor equation [21], with total energy requirements calculated by applying an activity factor of 1.4 representing a recreational level of activity (based on prescribed exercise). At the beginning of the intervention period, all participants were provided with example meal plans that would result in mean consumption of approximately 80% of estimated energy requirements and 1.4 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day (g/kg/day) over the 12 week intervention. Meal plans were customised based on food preferences for each individual and provided by a dietitian along with brief education on the Australian healthy eating guidelines [22].",b0cd2f4d-def1-4589-8ae1-9003d14f8c9a
5,methods5," As participants in the intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) group had limited energy available on fasting days to reach recommended protein intakes, they were provided with protein shakes and high protein soups to get as close to daily protein intake recommendations as possible. Participants were also instructed on how to use the Easy Diet Diary (Xyris Software, Australia, 2019) smartphone application to record their food, and substitute other foods of their choosing into the meal plans while maintaining the same energy and protein intake.  Intermittent fasting diet protocol  All participants in the intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) group were instructed to consume 100% of their energy requirements for 5 days per week (non-fasting days). On two non-consecutive and non-training days, participants consumed approximately 30% of their estimated energy requirements (~ 2100 kJ for females and ~ 2500 kJ for males) (fasting days), consistent with previous research [23, 24].",a11edd93-ac5c-4d49-84b8-edb7817c42f8
6,methods6," On fasting days, participants were prescribed a diet consisting of whey-based protein shakes (Formulite), high-protein soups and steamed/raw vegetables. The macronutrient composition of these supplements and the recommended intake on fasting days can be seen in Table 1. On fasting days, participants were asked to consume all energy during a 6 h window between 12.00 pm and 6.00 pm, to ensure an extended fasting period, but also allow flexibility of consumption to promote compliance. Further, they were allowed ad libitum consumption of non-energy providing beverages on fasting days. To match protein intakes across dietary groups as closely as possible, those in the intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) group were instructed to consume approximately 1.5 g/kg/day of protein on non-fasting days, as their fasting day diets only provided ~ 1.1–1.2 g/kg/day. This design resulted in the prescription of a 20% energy deficit and a mean intake of protein of 1.",b798f804-6a4a-40d9-a86e-fea618e7348f

8,methods8," This group represented a best practice ‘control’ group, as moderate energy restriction (15–30%) is most commonly recommended for weight loss [25, 26]. Furthermore, participants were also prescribed consumption of 1.4 g/kg/day of protein. Participants in this group also received customised meal plans and the same education as those in the intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) group.  Exercise protocol  All participants were required to undertake 3 training sessions each week: 2 resistance training sessions and 1 bodyweight aerobic/resistance training combination session. Training frequency of 3 times per week was seen as practical for the untrained participants, allowing adequate time for recovery, but also the stimulus for muscle growth. The two resistance training sessions were conducted at Swinburne University’s Hawthorn campus, and were supervised by an accredited strength and conditioning coach (who was also the study dietitian).",1466b375-e027-46c8-a27b-520e931d4225
9,methods9," The 2 supervised sessions consisted of variations of the following exercises: push-ups, squats, rows, lunges, bicep curls and dips (Supplemental Fig. 1). The exercises utilised were chosen due to their lack of technical difficulty given the untrained population being researched. Participants completed these exercises in a superset style workout, aiming to complete 12–15 repetitions of each exercise. Once participants were able to complete 3 sets of 15 repetitions in any individual exercise, the weight was increased or exercise variation made more difficult, adhering to the principles of progressive overload. The one bodyweight aerobic/resistance training combination session per week was completed by participants at home using bodyweight exercises consisting of planks, mountain climbers, crunches, burpees, lying side toe-touches and hip bridges. These exercises were also completed using a superset format with 2 min breaks, however, were timed instead of counting repetitions.",de941f12-fe20-49d3-ab18-151a479992f1
10,methods10," When participants reached their time goal with good form (self-assessed), they were instructed to increase this by 5 s. All exercise sessions were conducted on non-fasting days in the intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) group to promote maximal energy availability and avoid any detrimental effects of fasting on exercise performance.  Assessments  Bodyweight and body composition analysis  Weekly weight measurements were taken in light clothing using bioelectrical impedance scales [Multifrequency segmental body composition analyser; MC-780 Tanita Corporation (Tokyo, Japan)]. Lean body mass, fat mass and body fat percentage were assessed utilising dual x-ray absorptiometry [dual x ray absorptiometry (DXA); Hologic Horizon (Bedford MA)] at baseline and after the intervention period, as previously detailed [27].",c345fb7d-fc34-4ed8-82a2-4d54a4bab05e
11,methods11," The dual x ray absorptiometry (DXA) was calibrated for bone mineral density, muscle and fat masses on the morning of each assessment in accordance with manufacturer guidelines using spine and whole-body phantoms, respectively. Short and long-term coefficient of variation for these measurements were well within the acceptable level set by the manufacturer (< 5%).  Ultrasound  Muscle thickness, cross-sectional area (cross sectional area (CSA)) and muscle quality [echogenicity (EI)], were measured using ultrasound (SonoSite M-Turbo, SonoSite Australasia Pty Ltd, New South Wales, Australia) with a linear array transducer (5–2 MHz) for the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus intermedius (VI) of the non-dominant leg at baseline and post intervention (Supplemental Fig. 2). All images were acquired and analysed by the same technician. A fidelity check of the image acquisition and analysis was conducted by a health professional with over 10 years of experience in ultrasound imaging and analysis.",755b7174-2f11-4fa0-92d5-e7223aaaceae
12,methods12," Varying depths were required to obtain full visualisation of the RF in some instances, however, the gain was kept consistent across measurements. Measurements were acquired with participants in a supine position, with their knee in passive extension. Ultrasound gel was applied to the transducer, which was placed perpendicular to the long axis of the anterior thigh, at a distance of two-thirds from the anterior, superior iliac spine to the superior patellar border, consistent with previous studies [28]. Muscle thickness and cross sectional area (CSA) were measured in real-time with the on-board functions of the M-turbo, utilising the straight line and tracing functions, respectively. Images were also saved onto the on-board hard drive before being transferred onto a personal computer for EI analysis using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) [29].",6ac2b79c-8fc1-44f1-8323-fb7026cfe3a9
13,methods13," EI for RF and VI were measured utilising a standard square of 100 × 100 pixels, or where the predefined square did not fit within the cross section of the muscle, the largest square that fit within the anatomic boundaries of the muscle was utilised, a method which has shown good inter-observer reliability regardless of the level of expertise [30].  Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT)  pQCT was utilised to measure the surface area of muscle, intramuscular fat and subcutaneous fat at baseline and post intervention (Supplemental Fig. 3). A single 2.5 mm transverse pQCT; (Stratec XCT3000, Stratec Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany) scan with a voxel size of 0.4 mm was obtained at mid-thigh region of the non-dominant leg. The mid-thigh was defined as midway between the tip of the greater trochanter and medial edge of the tibial plateau, located by deep palpation.",f56d89a7-0ee8-4650-823a-4d0bf38122a2
14,methods14," The images were exported and further analyzed by Slice-O-Matic™ (Tomovision, Montreal, CA) to determine the muscle, intramuscular fat and subcutaneous fat volumes as previously described [31–33]. After visual checks; where due to beam hardening artefacts the tissue was not segmented (“tagged”) optimally, the assignment of individual voxels or small voxel islands were changed into the correct tissue manually, at the discretion of the operator. The pQCT was calibrated using the manufacturer’s phantom daily, with a coefficient of variation of 0.2%, as described previously [34].  All imaging and image analyses were carried out by a single experienced image analysis specialist (EB) or under his direct supervision.  Strength testing  Strength testing was undertaken prior to the diet intervention and at the end of week 12. A 3 repetition maximum (3RM) test and strength endurance test were performed for both bench press and leg press.",6b202cb8-8719-4ea2-a82a-0dd045344eb2
15,methods15," While these exercises were not included within the resistance training program, these were chosen as a standardised method of strength testing using similar movements to those included. After a brief 5 min warm up, participants were instructed on correct lifting and breathing techniques before practicing these using submaximal loads for 10–15 repetitions. Weight was gradually added and repetitions reduced to serve as a functional warm up. Participants then completed a set of 3 repetitions at a self-selected weight close to their perceived capacity, followed by a 3 min rest, with weight being continually added to each subsequent attempt. 3RM was recorded as the last successful attempt before form breakdown, or failure to complete the lift without assistance. The 3RM of each participant was determined within 5 attempts. After the 3RM test, participants were allowed a 5 min rest before undergoing a strength endurance test.",6baebbf0-aac0-4f85-ada5-0c2abe22abaf
16,methods16," These were tested in order such that 3RM bench press was followed by the bench press endurance test, and 3RM leg press was followed by the leg press endurance test. Participants were required to complete as many repetitions as possible of each exercise utilising 70% of their estimated 1 repetition maximum (1RM), calculated from the attained 3RM utilising the Brzycki formula [35] {weight lifted/[1.0278 – (0.0278 × repetitions performed)]}. Failure was determined as the first repetition where the participant required assistance. Repetitions where form was considered inadequate were not counted; however, participants were not stopped from completing subsequent repetitions if this occurred. Volume was calculated as the number of repetitions completed at 70% of 1RM multiplied by the weight lifted.  Dietary intake  Participants were required to keep a 3 day food diary at baseline and in week 1, 6 and 12 using the Easy Diet Diary (Xyris Software, Australia, 2019) phone application.",9405d9b7-9961-4ba3-b6e6-d787a0a5100a
17,methods17," This software has been shown to produce results similar to other, more time-intensive methods of dietary data collection such as 24 h recalls [36]. Participants recorded all food and drink intake on non-consecutive days that included 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day. Food records were kept on non-fasting days for those in the intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) group. On fasting days, participants were asked to note down any extra food or drink consumed, and whether they had consumed their recommended supplements. Intake on these days was estimated from these records. ",ffd286f4-6132-4d5a-b5d8-42a75d370f52
18,analysis0," Changes in lean body mass (LBM) were considered the primary outcome of this study. Sample size calculations were conducted using GPower version 3.1 [37] based on previous research showing a 2.4 kg loss of lean body mass (LBM) in response to similar study methodology to that of the current study in a comparable population [38]. This was contrasted with research into intermittent fasting plus resistance or endurance training that has shown a minimal effect on lean body mass (LBM), albeit with smaller reductions in weight [16, 23]. It was calculated that using an α error probability of 0.05 and power of 80%, 22 participants would be required to detect a 2.4 kg difference in lean body mass (LBM) between groups. Assuming a 33% attrition rate, total estimated sample size requirements were 29 participants. Results are presented as mean (± SD). Normality was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test and visual inspection of Q–Q plots.",d8ec4688-9883-41b1-87b2-d6ae9f990b57
19,analysis1," Assumptions of normality were violated for intramuscular fat only. Intramuscular fat was log10 transformed, resulting in normality. A linear mixed model with restricted maximum likelihood method was established based on a first-order autoregressive structure and used to analyse variables for main effects for time, group and sex, and all possible 2-way and 3-way interactions, with body mass index (BMI) and age included as random effects due to their inclusion as stratification variables. Differences between groups at baseline were analysed using independent t tests. Bivariate correlations using Pearson’s correlation co-efficient were calculated to assess relationships between variables and changes in lean body mass (LBM). All analyses were performed using SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, 2017). A p < 0.05 was considered significant for all tests. ",8bb1561e-ec92-414d-a441-7fddb53e59c7

32,discussion0," To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first randomised trial to have compared the effects of 5:2 intermittent fasting and continuous energy restriction on body composition and strength adaptations when concurrently undertaking resistance training. Our findings suggest that when overall dietary energy and protein intake are similar, both energy-restricted diets induced comparable increases in lean body mass (LBM) and strength, and reductions in weight and fat when combined with a 12 week resistance training program. In contrast, some differences were noted between groups in local assessments of the thigh muscle. Sex-dependent differences were also observed in both groups, specifically in weight and lean body mass (LBM) responses, with males demonstrating greater weight loss, but less gains in lean body mass (LBM). This could be a reflection of weight-loss-induced impairment of lean body mass (LBM) accrual, however; this concept requires further exploration.",ab3a8f6f-7644-4e7d-ac58-5bfe32069d6b
33,discussion1,"  In the current study, both dietary intervention groups experienced significant reductions in body fat (mean − 7.2 kg; 95% CI − 8.4 kg, − 6.0 kg) and increases in lean body mass (LBM) (mean + 1.7 kg; 95% CI + 1.1 kg, + 2.3 kg) suggesting weight lost was exclusively from fat. While whole-body composition changes were similar between groups, increases in lean body mass (LBM) have previously been more commonly reported in studies of individuals undertaking resistance training with continuous energy restriction than with intermittent fasting [39–43]. This could be a reflection of differences in daily energy restriction amounts but also study design, especially the training program. Studies demonstrating increases in lean body mass (LBM) while utilising continuous energy restriction have commonly employed more frequent and/or intense training protocols (i.e. 5–7 days/week) compared to the common 3 days/week model typically used in intermittent fasting studies [16] and the present study.",f1feca1c-3a88-43be-b1eb-39b94d89f325
34,discussion2," However, a 3 day/week training program could have important practical implications given it may be more appealing/realistic to undertake for a significant proportion of the general population. To our knowledge, only one other study has demonstrated significant increases in lean body mass (LBM) when intermittent fasting and resistance training were combined [19]. In this study, per-protocol analysis showed an increase of 1.4 and 1.0 kg in lean body mass (LBM) in trained women undertaking resistance training with and without β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (hydroxy β methylbutyrate (HMB)), respectively. However, as no concomitant changes in weight were observed, it is likely that participants were in energy balance. This could explain why these participants gained lean body mass (LBM), in contrast to other studies which have demonstrated small to moderate reductions in weight (− 1.0 kg to − 3.",eda74598-f38f-4ef4-b610-da8ce06877be
35,discussion3,"3 kg) alongside small losses, no change, or statistically non-significant increases in lean body mass (LBM) (− 0.4 kg to + 0.6 kg) [17, 18, 20, 39]. The paucity of studies investigating intermittent fasting with resistance training makes it difficult to ascertain if lean body mass (LBM) can be gained when both are combined in conjunction with a concomitant energy deficit [16]. Moreover, intermittent fasting is a broad concept, and while alternate day fasting, time-restricted feeding and 5:2 all fit under this umbrella, there are significant differences in how these diets are applied. For example, while time-restricted feeding uses extended periods of fasting each day (16–20 h), if an energy deficit is prescribed, it is generally on a daily basis. On the other hand, while alternate day fasting and 5:2 IF are similar in that they generally prescribe severe restrictions on fasting days and no restrictions on non-fasting days, the number of fasting days each week is different.",7bf3a96d-efaf-423a-8f5a-a634bc1b30bb
36,discussion4," Therefore, it is difficult to make direct comparisons between these results and those of previous studies, even if the diets used are all broadly classified as intermittent fasting.  Ultrasound assessment showed a non-significantly (p = 0.05) greater increase in RF thickness in the continuous energy restriction plus training (CERT) compared to the intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) group (continuous energy restriction plus training (CERT) =  + 0.18 cm; 95% CI + 0.13 cm, + 0.24 cm versus intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) =  + 0.10 cm; 95% CI + 0.01 cm, + 0.19 cm), with similar non-significant (p = 0.07) findings for RF cross sectional area (CSA) (continuous energy restriction plus training (CERT) =  + 0.95 cm2; 95% CI + 0.65 cm2, + 1.25 cm2 versus intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) =  + 0.58 cm2; 95% CI + 0.09 cm2, + 1.07 cm2). Similarly, pQCT demonstrated significantly (p = 0.",fb89e460-9546-4b29-b9d1-3d66b7460679
37,discussion5,"03) greater increases in muscle area in the continuous energy restriction plus training (CERT) group compared to intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) group (continuous energy restriction plus training (CERT) =  + 4.75 cm2; 95% CI + 1.76 cm2, + 7.73 cm2 versus intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) = − 0.69 cm2; 95% CI − 4.67 cm2, + 3.29 cm2). Observed differences between groups at the local musculature level could be due to a number of reasons. Firstly, it is known that muscle hypertrophy in response to resistance training does not occur uniformly throughout the body, with a upper body more responsive than lower body muscle mass [40–42] and thus it is likely that we missed changes in the upper body musculature by only assessing the thigh muscle.",69e66d35-06ee-44fe-8e77-449533f10ed8
38,discussion6," In support of this, it was noted that when examining dual x ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived regional differences in lean body mass (LBM), the intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) group showed greater relative increases in the upper body compared to those in the continuous energy restriction plus training (CERT) group, albeit marginally, while the opposite was true for the lower body (Supplementary Table 2). Secondly, our small, uneven sample size may have been insufficient to identify real differences between diet groups when utilising more sensitive assessments of muscle, especially given the known large inter-individual variability in adaptations to resistance training [43]. Despite the differences, change in muscle surface area as measured by pQCT was positively correlated with changes in whole-body lean body mass (LBM) (r = 0.51) for both groups combined, suggesting muscular hypertrophy may have underpinned the increases in lean body mass (LBM).",29fa736d-afc8-4756-988b-26a6bb4f4310
39,discussion7," These findings support the notion that muscle accrual can occur together with reductions in fat mass when energy deficits are combined with resistance training and protein intakes above standard daily recommendations [44–48].  Notable differences between sexes in terms of the magnitude of lean body mass (LBM) change were evident in the present study. Female participants gained significantly more lean body mass (LBM) on average (+ 2.5 kg; 95% CI + 1.7 kg, + 3.3 kg versus + 0.9 kg; 95% CI + 0.2 kg, + 1.6 kg) compared to males, but experienced less weight loss (− 2.2 kg; 95% CI − 3.8 kg, − 0.7 kg versus − 5.5 kg; 95% CI − 6.7 kg, − 4.4 kg). A number of sex-specific factors may explain the disparity in weight and fat reduction between males and females.",81ecc21d-f5f5-432d-8eae-f26f3a2d98d5
40,discussion8," First, although all participants were prescribed similar relative energy deficits (20–23%—with slight variation due to the standardised nature of fasting days), comparatively larger lean mass in males (and therefore higher energy requirements) would have led to a greater absolute energy deficit for males by ~ 600 kJ/day. Given that the reported energy deficit for both sexes was ~ 10% more than prescribed (~ 30%), the absolute difference between sexes was most likely greater than this. When combined with the fact that females may require a greater absolute energy deficit per unit of weight-loss [49], are more likely to under-report energy intake [50] and may be impacted by hormones that promote weight retention [51, 52], it is not surprising that males experienced greater weight and fat loss in the current study.",793da636-4c88-4c55-add8-203ee592a37b
41,discussion9," Additionally, differences in total amounts (and therefore overall rate) of weight loss between sexes could partially explain the greater lean body mass (LBM) gains in females compared to males. Previous research has shown that slower rates of weight loss may be beneficial for lean body mass (LBM) preservation, though this finding is not ubiquitous in the literature [53]. Congruent with this, when all weight loss and lean body mass (LBM) changes for both sexes were pooled together in the current study, there was a moderate, positive correlation between change in weight and change in lean body mass (LBM) (r = 0.63). That is, as weight loss increased, lean body mass (LBM) gains were reduced and potentially compromised. However, when split by diet, this relationship strengthened in the continuous energy restriction plus training (CERT) group (r = 0.86), but weakened in the intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) group to be statistically non-significant (r = 0.23).",b345dc93-878c-45ec-8064-0662eadc8e3f
42,discussion10," This trend was also seen when comparing a relative overall fat loss with changes in lean body mass (LBM). These findings may suggest that when paired with resistance training, the 5:2 style diet could be protective/promote gains in lean body mass (LBM) compared with continuous energy restriction when greater amounts of weight loss occur. However, given the contrasting observations in pQCT and ultrasound assessments, which favoured the continuous energy restriction plus training (CERT) group in some measurements, this concept is speculative and requires further investigation.  Upper and lower body muscle strength and endurance were significantly increased over the 12 week period, regardless of dietary intervention. There was a moderate, positive correlation between increases in lean body mass (LBM) and 3RM for both bench press (r = 0.48) and leg press (r = 0.",79621bca-e925-4229-ae11-c2f0df3e9941
43,discussion11,"55), suggesting that some of this increase may be attributable to growth in lean body mass (LBM), although given the untrained population studied, it is probable that neuromuscular adaptations also contributed significantly [42]. Regardless, this provides evidence that when combined with resistance training, both diets appeared to support increases in strength in a comparable manner.  There were a number of strengths of the current study. First, participants were supervised for the majority of their training sessions, allowing standardisation of form and effort. Second, frequent access to the study dietitian may have helped improve motivation and compliance. Third, we utilised non-invasive and reliable methods of assessment to measure changes in muscle size and quality alongside whole body lean body mass (LBM) (pQCT and ultrasound), both of which have shown utility in clinical settings [54, 55].  Our study was also subject to a number of limitations.",72a308b6-e3ef-42b3-99db-f2aaec52f842
44,discussion12," First, while frequent supervision and feedback for training and diet may have helped with study validity, this may not be practical for the general population. Second, although we collected detailed dietary data, the limitations of self-reported dietary intake are well known [56], and our ability to make strong inferences based on dietary data were limited. However, reported intake did reflect the aims of our study (i.e. increased intake on non-fasting days for the intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) compared to the continuous energy restriction plus training (CERT) group). Third, it is unclear how the provision of supplements to the intermittent fasting plus training (IFT) group on fasting days may have affected compliance, or whether the supplements themselves may have contributed to the results. Fourth, as we did not record menstrual cycle for females, it is unclear whether this may have affected our results.",08e7eb52-05b2-4d54-b14c-7164671a68a0
45,discussion13," Finally, the sample size calculation used in the present study was based on research using similar population demographics and study designs available at the time [16, 23, 38]. However, the effect size determined by the magnitude of difference in the primary outcome measure (i.e. lean body mass (LBM)) does appear to be larger than those observed in more contemporary studies that focus on intermittent fasting and resistance training. Thus, the final sample size in the current study may have been too low to detect smaller (but potentially clinical meaningful) differences in lean body mass (LBM) that could arise from similar interventions, and future research may benefit from including greater numbers to overcome this limitation.",e7432778-415e-439d-84d0-e412a80c6c2e
46,discussion14,"  In summary, 5:2 intermittent fasting or continuous energy restriction combined with moderate protein intake and resistance training over 12 weeks led to comparable lean body mass (LBM) gains, weight and body fat loss, and improvements in muscle strength, endurance and quality. However, there were clear sexual dimorphic differences in a number of these outcomes, and some disparities between groups when the measurement of whole-body changes were compared to localised muscle changes. Future studies should investigate the longer-term impacts of 5:2 fasting in comparison to continuous energy restriction, but importantly, explore the relationship between transient changes in energy balance and protein turnover, weight loss and muscle mass accrual.
