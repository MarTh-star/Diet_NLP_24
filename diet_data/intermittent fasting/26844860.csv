0,methods0,"Experimental animals All mice used in this study were of the FVB/NJ background. Animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament), with the experimental protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai, China [SYXK(SH)2011-0112]. Generation of ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice was described previously2324.  Acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity was induced in 2-month-old WT and ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice by a single intraperitoneal injection of DOX (20 mg/kg, BBI, Toronto, Canada) dissolved in saline. Chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity was induced in eight-week-old WT and ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice by intraperitoneally injected 6 doses of DOX (4 mg/kg, dissolved in saline) at weekly intervals.",2c382235-be15-4a66-a09a-175191b88ed9
1,methods1," Mice were observed for another 2 weeks before assessment of cardiac function.  In both acute and chronic DOX cardiotoxicity, mice were anaesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and euthanized by rapid cervical dislocation at the indicated time points and left ventricles were dissected from the excised hearts for western blot and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) analysis. For histological and immunohistochemical staining, mice were anaesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and the entire hearts were used to prepare paraffin-embedded serial sections in four-chamber view. Generally time-course analysis of vacuolar degeneration and fibrosis in LVs were performed in acute and chronic DOX cardiotoxicity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis were assessed 5 days after DOX treatment in acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and at 4 weeks of DOX treatment in chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.",bbbf1431-d7f2-4162-a228-15ea866711d5

In acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, the survival rate of DOX-treated ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice was significantly lowered compared with DOX-treated wild type (WT) control mice (Fig. 1a).

26,results1," We barely detected vacuolar degeneration of cardiomyocytes from vehicle-treated WT and ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice. As expected, DOX-treated WT mice showed significant increase in degenerative vacuoles (Fig. 1b,c). Importantly, ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice showed more degenerative vacuoles compared with WT controls after DOX treatment (Fig. 1b,c). No fibrosis was detected in vehicle-treated WT and ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice. After DOX treatment, fibrosis was present in WT and ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice (Fig. 1d). However, ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice developed more pronounced fibrosis 5 days after DOX treatment (Fig. 1d,e).",10377df5-9ea5-4eb8-be88-f54baff70870

Moreover, the serum activities of lactate dehydrogenase (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) and myocardial muscle creatine kinase (CK-MB), two important biomarkers for cardiac injury26, rose significantly in DOX-treated ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice compared with DOX-treated WT controls (Fig. 1f,g).

28,results3,"  ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency exacerbates chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity Next we examined the effects of ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency on chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Again, the survival rate of DOX-treated ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice was significantly reduced compared with DOX-treated WT controls (Fig. 2a). Cytoplasmic vacuolization was more apparent in ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice compared with WT controls at 4 and 6 weeks of DOX treatment (Fig. 2b,c). In addition, ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice showed more fibrosis at 4 and 6 weeks of DOX treatment (Fig. 2d,e).

Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS%), reduced in DOX-treated WT mice, were further decreased in DOX-treated ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice, suggestive of more depressed cardiac function in ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice after chronic DOX treatment (Fig. 2h,i).

30,results5,"  ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency increases Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity It is well established that DOX acts as an electron acceptor to stimulate mitochondria to generate Reactive oxygen species (ROS)27, which has long been considered as the major mediator of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity26. Therefore, we assessed Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels using Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive fluorescence probe DCFH-DA in acute and chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Given that LVs from DOX-treated ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice showed more dramatic difference in degenerative vacuoles and fibrosis 5 days after DOX treatment compared with DOX-treated WT controls, we chose 5 days as a time-interval to detect Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in acute cardiotoxicity. DOX treatment enhanced Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in LVs from WT mice (Fig. 3a,b).",308020d6-b983-46e2-be6c-1d5e84f8cba8
31,results6," In ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice, Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were further enhanced after acute and chronic DOX treatment (Fig. 3a,b). These data suggest that exacerbation of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency is at least partially attributed to enhanced Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels.  ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency enhances apoptosis in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity Apoptosis, which can be triggered d by Reactive oxygen species (ROS), also contributes to DOX-induced cardiomyopathy2829. First we performed TUNEL assays to detect apoptotic cell death in acute and chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. TUNEL-positive cells were significantly increased in the hearts from WT mice after DOX treatment (Figs S4 and 3c,d).",80995e6a-6747-4d85-80d7-631bf7d597e1

We then performed western blot to detect X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (X linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)), the most potent inhibitor of caspase 3 activity in IAP family30, to determine apoptosis. X linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) protein abundance was significantly reduced in the hearts from DOX-treated WT mice compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 3e–h), suggestive of increased apoptotic cell after DOX treatment.",08c1f1b3-f946-4499-94c0-5cf2e57d7f6b
33,results8," Moreover, DOX-treated ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice showed significantly lower X linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) protein levels in the hearts compared with DOX-treated WT controls, suggesting ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency enhanced apoptotic cell death compared with WT controls after DOX treatment (Fig. 3e–h). Thus, these results suggest that increased apoptosis contributes to exacerbation of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency.  ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency elevates inflammatory cytokines in the heart in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity Growing evidence has shown that inflammation is induced in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity31. Therefore, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in the heart using ELISA method. TNFα (Fig. S5a,b), IL-6 (Fig. S5c,d) and IL-1β (Fig.",0a414624-191f-4cbd-8d2c-26cb63df6d43

Therefore, ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency promotes inflammation in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.  Autophagic flux is impaired in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity The Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production contributes to mitochondrial damage, which in turn, stimulates more Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, forming a vicious cycle. In addition, damaged mitochondria are capable of triggering cell death32. Autophagy plays a housekeeping role in clearing damaged mitochondria in the heart to regulate mitochondria quality control, which reduces Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis3334.",8f99c476-fb7c-42a7-8cac-bd1b3f9ec9f2
35,results10," We hypothesize that DOX impairs cardiac autophagy in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, which is exacerbated by ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency due to aggravated impairment of autophagic flux. To test this hypothesis, we first examined autophagic flux in LVs from DOX-treated WT mice. In acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, we assessed autophagic flux 5 days after DOX treatment. LC3 II protein levels were significantly increased in DOX-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated controls. However, the accumulation of LC3 II in DOX-treated mice was not further increased by CQ treatment, suggesting attenuation of autophagic flux by DOX treatment (Fig. 4a,b).

Consistently, immunohistochemistry showed more LC3-positive dots in LVs from ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice compared with WT controls after acute (Fig. 5g,h) and chronic (Fig. 5i,j) DOX treatment. Moreover, increased accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, a substrate for cardiac autophagy35, was induced in LVs from ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice 5 days after DOX treatment in acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (Fig.",315bca2f-e12e-466a-afc1-8c3aeea39e25

Beclin 1 is involved in autophagy induction, while Atg5 forms a complex with conjugation to Atg12, which is essential for autophagosome formation36. As reported previously23, Beclin 1 protein levels were lower in the hearts from ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice compared with WT controls under normal conditions (Fig. S6a,e). Both acute and chronic DOX treatment increased Beclin 1 protein levels in WT and ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. S6a,b,e,f), consistent with previous studies showing that DOX treatment induces autophagy induction.",dbfa6492-3552-49d1-b672-b54d9e381661

Atg5 protein abundance remained unaltered in response to DOX treatment (Fig. S6c,d,g,h). Overall, these data suggest that ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency further impaired autophagic flux in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.  Intermittent fasting restores autophagy in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity Short-term fasting restores autophagy in several pathological conditions37383940.",78bbe3a3-d537-4d8f-9ddb-98b7c221c848

It should be pointed out that prolonged fasting generates a variety of negative effects on the health. Therefore, we applied intermittent fasting, which avoids adverse effects produced by prolonged fasting and meanwhile boosts cardiac autophagy in a cyclic manner41, to the experimental mice. We sought to determine whether intermittent fasting is capable of rescuing autophagy in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. To achieve this, we subjected WT and ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice to every-other-day fasting, starting one day before the initial injection of DOX.

Moreover, intermittent fasting had no effect on LAMP-1 and LMAP-2 pattern in LVs from ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice after acute and chronic DOX treatment (Figs S7a,b and S8a,b), indicating that chronic DOX treatment and DOX treatment combining ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency cause more severe damage to lysosomes or autolysosomes in the heart.

Previously we have shown that ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) regulates autophagic flux in the heart at autophagosome maturation step23. Here we sought to determine the role of ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-mediated autophagy in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. To accomplish this, we established mouse models of acute and chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity frequently used mimicking acute and chronic DOX cardiotoxicity in patients424344. A major finding of this study was that ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency exacerbated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. In addition, the survival rate was significantly lower in ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice compared with WT controls after DOX treatment.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been considered the major mediator in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Mitochondria, which are abundant in cardiomyocyte, are the main source of Reactive oxygen species (ROS). Turnover of damaged mitochondria through autophagy is essential to maintain cardiomyocyte structure and function33. Therefore, enhanced levels of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in LVs from DOX-treated ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice are at least partially attributed to more severe impairment of autophagic flux.",e958694d-3281-44d0-8065-f0067ff27211

Future research is needed to investigate regulation of mitochondrial iron accumulation by ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) in DOX cardiotoxicity. We cannot rule out the possibility that defects other than autophagy resulting from ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency contribute to exacerbated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.  Inflammatory cytokines are elevated by ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency after DOX treatment.

47,discussion3," In addition, mitochondrial DNA that escapes from autophagic degradation causes inflammation and cardiac dysfunction46. ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency aggravates DOX-induced impaired autophagic flux, which may increase free mitochondrial DNA in cardiomyocytes and promote inflammation.  The key question is what are the potential mechanisms that DOX impairs autophagic flux and ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency aggravates impaired autophagic flux in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity? By means of detecting LC3 II and p62 protein abundance in the heart elicited by CQ-treated WT mice, we showed that autophagic flux was impaired in acute and chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, which is in agreement with several other studies1547. Interestingly, LC3 II and p62 in LVs from DOX-treated animals were more abundant compared with animals treated with CQ alone.",4f9ba72c-d488-4fb9-97d4-cd0bcf1dac76
48,discussion4," CQ was reported to inhibit autophagic flux by altering lysosomal PH48, which was shown somehow elevated in DOX-treated cardiomyocyte47 while this manuscript was in preparation. Therefore, CQ and DOX exert overlapping functions at this point. In addition, DOX increases autophagic activation while blunting autophagosome formation41. We also showed that Beclin 1, a positive mediator of autophagy induction, was upregulated in DOX-treated animals. Thus, the enhanced LC3 II in DOX-treated mice compared with mice treated with CQ alone may be caused by combinatorial effects of DOX on increased autophagic induction, impaired autophagosome formation and lysosomal degradation. Previously, autophagosome maturation has been suggested to be impaired in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy15. Our recent studies have shown that ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) deficiency impairs autophagic flux in the heart through inhibiting autophagosome maturation.",fe3d5372-a96a-4da0-a02b-f7c16f87d761

Thus, autophagosome maturation is blunted but not completely suppressed in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Taken together, our results and previous work suggest that multiple crucial steps of autophagy including autophagosome formation, maturation and autolysosomal degradation are blunted in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, resulting in reduced autophagic flux.",bd22e678-dca0-4cdf-a8c2-1ab4db03c504
50,discussion6,"  Fasting exerts a number of beneficial effects on health mediated by remodeling of mitochondria dynamics, enhanced mitochondria biogenesis, changes in energy metabolism, decreased signaling pathway associated with survival such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling, reduction in mitochondria oxidative stress and promotion of autophagy37. Fasting has been demonstrated to activate autophagy regulator TFEB, which in turn promotes expression of genes involved in sequential stages of autophagy, leading to enhanced autophagic protein degradation49. Given that several crucial steps of autophagic pathway were targeted by DOX in the heart, it is reasonably expected that fasting could be efficient to restore autophagic flux in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.

We provided evidence that intermittent fasting reduced the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and decreased protein levels of LC3 II and p62, suggesting that autophagy is restored in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. However, the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In addition to restoring autophagy, intermittent fasting ameliorated pathology of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in WT and ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice manifested by reduced degenerative vacuoles, collagen accumulation, Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and apoptosis, indicating that impaired autophagy contributes to DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.

Thus, chronic DOX treatment may cause more severe damage to lysosomes or autolysosomes. Furthermore, intermittent fasting showed no impact on LAMP-1 or LAMP-2-positive dots in DOX-treated ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG)-deficient mice, consistent with the fact that ultra violet radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG) regulates ALR22.
