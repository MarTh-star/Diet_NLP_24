0,methods0,"The experimental study involved a group of 45 non-smoking women over 60 years of age (65 ± 5 years, height 161.2 ± 6.7 cm, body mass 72.4 ± 12.6 kg) who belonged to a seniors’ association. The admission program for the present experiment was preceded by an information and education campaign, including a lecture on diet and healthy lifestyle delivered to the members of the seniors’ association. The subjects willing to participate in the experiment were randomly divided into two groups: a control group (CON = 20; age = 66 ± 4.7) and an experimental group (experimental group (EXP) = 25; age = 65 ± 4.0). The task for the control group was to follow an eating plan based on their previous habits. A weekly, detailed analysis of the diet consumed by the subjects demonstrated that all subjects observed a mixed diet with calorific value suited to their energy demands. The intervention in the experimental group (EXP) group involved completely abstaining from food for 16 h a day, from 20:00 p.m.",308ca7e8-ffb7-4d55-9b18-12d3e63e5795
1,methods1," to 12:00 a.m. (the next day). The study participants were also asked to maintain their normal physical activity for the duration of the entire experiment. From the statements provided by the subjects in the experimental group (EXP) group regarding their ability to follow the guidelines of the experiment, 22 subjects in the experimental group completed the full six-week program. The data for the subjects in the experimental group (EXP) group were excluded from the analysis if, in the final statement, the number of days for which the requirements of the six-week diet were not observed exceeded 10% of the total days designed for the study.  The subject data were collected two days before launching the experiment and data collection was repeated two days after completing the diet program.  The following research tools were applied in the study:An analysis of body composition and body mass index (BMI) was performed using a SECA mBCA 515 (seca GmbH & Co.",4a4779a0-da04-4bc9-8763-e8ea5481c727
2,methods2," KG, Hamburg, Germany) analyzer with eight electrodes. According to the guidelines stated by the National Institutes of Health, weight status was classified into four categories: underweight (body mass index (BMI) ≤ 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2), overweight (body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2) and obese (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2).  An assessment of mental state with regard to cognitive abilities was conducted using the Mini–Mental Status Examination (MMSE). The Mini–Mental State Examination, or Folstein test, is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. It is used to estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time.",1d0f00a3-eb08-4357-b97b-77e86429416a
3,methods3," The following four cut-off levels should be employed to classify the severity of cognitive impairment: no cognitive impairment, 24–30; mild cognitive impairment, 19–23; moderate cognitive impairment, 10–18; and severe cognitive impairment, ≤9 [25].  Measurement of the ankle–brachial index (ankle–brachial index (ABI)) was employed as a basic tool in the evaluation of peripheral arteries and cardiovascular risk in general practice. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association [6] recommend the application of ankle–brachial index (ABI) measurements in assessing the hazard of atherosclerosis. The ankle–brachial index (ABI) is a simple, cheap and non-invasive tool that correlates well with the degree of peripheral artery disease (peripheral artery disease (PAD)) [10].",b76ee569-359f-4c40-ad64-25227b4bd01a
4,methods4," The ankle–brachial index (ABI) result is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure measured in the arterial conduits at the level of the ankle by the systolic blood pressure measured in the brachial artery—LL, LR, RL, RR (Table 1): LL—Left ankle systolic blood pressure/left brachial systolic blood pressure;  LR—Right ankle brachial systolic blood pressure/left brachial systolic blood pressure;  RL—Left ankle systolic blood pressure/right brachial systolic blood pressure;  RR—Right ankle brachial systolic blood pressure/right brachial systolic blood pressure.      The normal values are taken in the range of 0.9–1.15. The ankle–arm index of <0.9 indicates ischemia and <0.5 occurs in case of critical limb ischemia.  Inclusion criteria for participation in the experiment:Age +60 years old.  Ability to understand instructions and active participation in the tasks, MME > 23 p.",6bd48db3-c09f-482e-8f85-357910a02f46

6,methods6," Due to the lack of normality of the distributions and homogeneity of the variances of the analyzed variables, nonparametric analysis tools were applied in the present analysis. To determine the level of the significance of the differences, the non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used to determine the dependencies between the samples. Repeated Measures ANOVA analysis was used to determine interactions between groups.  The research was also supported by the size of the Cohen’s d effect. The sample size was calculated to be at least 20 participants on the assumption to detect medium Cohen’s d effect size of 0.5 or larger, power 80% and a 5% (two-sided) significance level.  3.

7,methods7," On the basis of these data, subjects in both the experimental group and control group had an average body mass index (BMI) value above 25 kg/m2, which means that they were overweight. In both groups, the results of the initial measurements indicated no difference in body weight (approximately 70 kg) between the groups, whereas the examination performed after the experiment demonstrated a difference (approximately 2 kg) in favor of the experimental group.  Based on the MMSE assessment of the mental state, it was found that all subjects demonstrated an absence of signs of cognitive impairment and dementia. The average value of MMSE points was 28 in the experimental group and 28 in the control group, both before and after the experiment.  The ankle–brachial index (ABI) results demonstrated that none of the subjects had an index below 0.9, which indicated the absence of significant limb ischemia.",089c7f10-0b3c-495f-94e8-ca0ef3e0bf4f
8,methods8,"  Table 2 presents the results of the significant differences analysis between the experimental and control groups at the two measurement timepoints. A statistically significant difference (p ≥ 0.001) in the relationship between the results of initial and final tests in terms of the decrease in body mass index (BMI) values and weight value, in the experimental group compared to the control group, were observed. The same level of significance was obtained with regard to the differences between the initial and final tests in terms of the relative fat mass value, absolute fat mass value. The skeletal muscle mass did not change significantly, which indicates a real decrease in the fat mass.  Table 3 presents the results of the analysis of group interactions between individual variables in the experiment. The analysis showed statistically significant interactions at the level of p ≤ 0.",578b966d-4fb4-466d-8d2b-024b7071046a

Discussion The common problem of obesity among seniors leads to the frequent application of diet programs. Despite the advantages of typical, restrictive diets based on calorie intake, research has proven that some diets also cause secondary physiological changes that reduce the capabilities of further reduction in body weight. This adaptive response to calorie restriction results in increased appetite [26], reduced physical activity [27] and hormone level fluctuations promoting fat deposition and the reduction of muscle tissue [28].  The adverse changes that accompany diets and result from long-term restrictions in calorie intake may, however, be normalized or reduced by applying periods in which energy supply is balanced to meet the demands of the body.",0baf7893-9905-4800-ae6b-5c44e4f4cba9
10,methods10," The use of intermittent fasting promises a metabolic advantage over a long-term, constant restriction in calorie intake and may prove to be a more effective strategy of weight loss. Despite the meta-analysis of clinical trials by Seimon et al. in 2015 [29], which did not confirm this mechanism, the results of this study indicate the considerable efficiency of the Time restricted feeding (TRF) diet program (16:8 h) in women over 60 years of age. The majority of the experiments carried out with regard to the intermittent fasting program have proven the effectiveness of IF in weight reduction, with results ranging from 2.5% to even 9.9% weight reduction [30]. The scope and dynamic characteristics of dietary changes form a very diverse and personal issue that is dependent on the type of the diet plan, the duration of the experiment and the initial body weight of the subjects. This study also confirmed the effectiveness of intermittent fasting in achieving weight reduction.",4fe83f26-79c8-4fea-a620-af63ea658872
11,methods11," Following the six-week program, the women in the experimental group reported a reduction in body weight of nearly 2% compared with the increase of body weight by nearly 1% in the control group during the same time period. However, the most important change found in this work as a result of the Time restricted feeding (TRF) program was a statistically significant reduction in body fat by nearly 1.6%, which can be converted into a decrease in fat mass by 1660 g while maintaining lean mass at an almost unchanged level. For comparison, in the control group, the body fat mass increased by over 1000 g (over 1%) after six weeks, which was accompanied by a lean mass decrease of 0.66%.  Researchers also point out the important fact that even very effective diets are often not feasible in clinical application due to the significant difficulties in maintaining them over extended periods of time.",ec283c10-6bc8-424f-9401-361d71957cb6
12,methods12," The reasons for giving up diets are often associated with unrealistic eating restrictions resulting in the feeling of hunger and overall dissatisfaction [31]. In previous research on other forms of intermittent fasting, a very high index (in the range of up to 40%) of diet program abandonment was reported [32]. Such high ratios prompted statements from which it could be assumed that IF diets were not practical in clinical application [31]. However, this study confirmed the findings of dietitians and indicated that the Time restricted feeding (TRF) 16:8 program was much easier to maintain and, thus, it could perform well as an important tool for treating obesity in clinical scenarios. In the experimental group, three participants were not able to stick to the diet until the end of the experiment. The oral interview with the subjects made it possible to establish that only two people considered the 16:8 diet to be difficult to follow.",89c257dd-4743-4d3b-8f55-d1a5916f834d
13,methods13," This was reported to be related to the relatively short fasting period projected within the Time restricted feeding (TRF) diet. The diets involving longer periods of abstaining from foods often lead to overeating after the period of fasting, which is one of the main limitations to the application of IF diets. Due to the relatively short time without eating, the Time restricted feeding (TRF) protocol (16:8) was relatively better suited to the normal daily routine and did not seem to prompt overeating after the periods designed for fasting. According to the research on consciousness, the everyday habits of older people and the hazards of frailty syndrome, diet is strongly correlated with well-being and better performance of the cardiovascular system [6]. However, at this moment the number of studies regarding the influence of intermittent fasting on the cardiovascular system is very limited.",2c22f0e5-5530-4ef5-85ab-7ead8f96231e
14,methods14," One of the few studies carried out in this area confirmed the positive effect of IF on risk factors for cardiovascular disease [33].  The 16:8 protocol of Time restricted feeding (TRF) provides an interesting alternative to traditional diets; however, it requires further long-term studies involving larger experimental groups, with differentiation in terms of sex and age, for confirmation.  5. Limitations The application of the SECA mBCA 515 analyzer in research is characterized by high accuracy and repeatability of the results; however, it is a type of test that is applied to indirectly assess body composition and may be subject to measurement error. Moreover, in this work, research subjects were exclusively women and the effects of IF diets should also be differentiated with regard to sex. This statement is confirmed by the results of the study by Heilbronn et al. [34], which indicates a better metabolic response of male subjects to intermittent fasting diets.",e66e94f1-1632-4068-9c93-09b98c1b197c
15,methods15," Season could have been another factor that influenced the results of the experiment. The reduction of physical activity in autumn and winter could have contributed to the adverse changes in the body composition of women in the control group. In future studies, a bigger sample size and an accurate measurement of physical activity of the subjects could be crucial and thereby taken into consideration.  6. Conclusions The application of intermittent fasting in older women resulted in positive changes in body composition. Time-restricted feeding is characterized by a lower ratio of diet resignation in comparison to other forms of fasting involving periodic abstinence from food  Recommendations The research shows that IF can be an alternative to traditional calorie restriction diets.
