0,introduction0," Gastric precancerous lesions (Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)) serve as a critical stage in the development of chronic atrophic gastritis (chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG)) to gastric cancer (GC) or gastric adenocarcinoma 1, 2. Slowing the process of precancerous lesions plays an important role in reducing the incidence of gastric cancer and prolongs the life of cancer survivors. Previous studies have shown that depressive disorder is highly prevalent in patients with gastrointestinal diseases 3. Gastrointestinal departments in general hospitals have investigated this matter and their results showed that nearly half of the chronic gastritis patients suffered from psychological problems such as anxiety and depression 3, 4. Some studies discovered inflammation in the stomach would cause anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in experimental animals through neuroendocrine pathways 5, 6. Thus, depression may be frequently associated with gastrointestinal inflammations.",2ff983d9-f784-4fc9-bde7-75908f94f89c
1,introduction1," Depression is a mental health disorder which varies from mild to severe changes in mood and affects physical, mental, and behavioral health. Chronic stress, environmental factors, socioeconomic conditions, lifestyles, and eating habits are closely related to the formation of long-term depression. Similarly, depression would influence the condition of diseases. Depression is at least two to three times more common in people with gastrointestinal disorders (GI) than in the general population, by some estimates 7. Some researchers found around 50% of investigated patients with GC suffered from depression and their life quality decreased with aggrandizing anxiety and depression 8, 9. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the mental health of the gastrointestinal disease patients.  Chronic inflammatory processes, which are associated with stress might be a fundamental symptom of depression, especially in cancer patients 10.",bea9d275-d838-4891-91b5-61b3dc6858d3
2,introduction2," However, the influences of depression were rarely of concern in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL). Based on our previous studies 1, 11, we explored the pathologic structure and ultrastructure of stomach mucosal disease in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats, which applied N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (methyl N' nitro N nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)) free drinking method combined with intermittent fasting. Consistent with Correa's findings 12, we found chronic atrophic gastritis, specialized intestinal metaplasia (specialized intestinal metaplasia (SIM)), cardia intestinal metaplasia (cardia intestinal metaplasia (CIM)), and dysplasia (Dys) appeared in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) group successively. We considered that the morphological abnormality, like intestinal metaplasia (IM) and dysplasia, incorporated inflammatory within gastric mucosa, may be the histological basis of gastric cancer 13-17.",42eabb2b-a422-4e3d-ac0e-cf6ee0ea5c64
3,introduction3," Some studies showed that inflammation had close relationship with depression in some diseases 18-20.  In this study, we compared two kinds of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) animal models. One uses the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) animal model we used in a previous study while the other uses a combination of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) with chronic unpredicted mild stress (chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS)) to establish a comprehensive Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) model 21-24, which would be similar to clinical patients. In order to find out whether Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats would suffer from depression and whether depression influences the process of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) and food intake, we administrated a dynamic observation to compare the difference of histopathology and food consumption alteration, as well as observed the inflammation factors and gastrointestinal hormone change at the final stage.",6275a60b-ea42-4868-90ab-c6304326eaf5

In the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) group, 200μg/mL N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (methyl N' nitro N nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)) free drinking method combined with intermittent fasting was applied to establish the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) animal model. Based on this, we combined the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats with chronic unpredicted mild stress (chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS)) to establish a comprehensive model. We then evaluated their behavior by open field tests and sucrose preference tests.

32,results16,"  Chronic stress could increase cell proliferation and decrease apoptosis, contributed to the development of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)  To explore whether chronic stress accelerates the process of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL), we measured the expression of NF-κB, P53, Bcl-2 and Bax in the gastric tissues, which are the associated biomarker of inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis and malignancy. NF-κB system is a key in linking inflammation and cancer 35. Our results showed that NF-κB was significantly increased in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) and Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) groups, compared to the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, Fig. 5A, 5B). The overexpression of P53 protein is closely related to the occurrence of gastric cancer and plays an important role in the development of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) and GC.",618d0052-4cf8-4fa5-a358-f14b4faa1166
33,results17," The expression of P53 had a significant increase in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) and Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.001, Fig. 5A, 5C), compared to the control group. Further, Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) showed a significantly increased expression of P53 compared to the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats.  Bcl-2 and Bax are the specific biomarkers of proliferation and apoptosis. Our results showed that the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly increased and Bax was significantly decreased in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) and Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.001, Fig. 5A, 5D, 5E), compared to the control group.",22027472-a2b5-4230-a41e-198ad6666273
34,results18," Compared to Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) group, the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax both had significant change in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) group (P < 0.05, P < 0.05, Fig. 5A, 5D, 5E). Bcl-2/Bax ratio was significantly increased in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) and Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) groups, compared to the control group (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, Fig. 5F). This means inflammation involved in the development process of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) and chronic stress could increase cell proliferation and decrease apoptosis which would contribute to the development of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL).  GKN2 and Ghrelin might serve as the potential roles in the process of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)  In our experiments, we found that two rats suffer from tumors (Fig. 6F, 6I).",346318dd-82bd-4949-a2cb-9490b66f977c
35,results19," We used immunofluorescence to observe the expression of Ghrelin and GKN2 in gastric tissues near and within the tumors.  In order to better evaluate the indicators of gastric mucosal function, this study observed the expression of GKN2 in gastric mucosa. GKN2 is expressed in normal gastric mucosal cells (Fig. 6A). We found a Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rat with tumors that had a strong expression of GKN2 on the luminal side of gastric mucosa, which may be related to the degree of intestinal metaplasia. We also found GKN2 expressed in lamina propria of gastric mucosa and tumor of the rat suffered from tumors (Fig. 6D, 6E, 6J). Interestingly, compared to the HE stains, the places that had strong expression of GKN2 and Ghrelin, were located around the blood vessels in the tumor (Fig. 6J, 6K, 6I).",40377e0e-ae66-472d-8a5e-0a6c4b82533a
36,results20,"  Due to the reduction of gastric glands in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) process, the level of Ghrelin concentration in whole body decreases. This is proven in previous results. Based on our findings, we observed that Ghrelin is produced in the fundic glands of the stomach. We found Ghrelin mostly expressed in lamina propria of gastric mucosa of control rat (Fig. 6B). However, the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rat that suffered from tumors had the expression of Ghrelin on the luminal side of gastric mucosa (Fig. 6E).

37,discussion0," Chronic stress is a major harmful factor in our society as it elicits symptoms like depression and anxiety. Comorbid diseases are the important issues in cancer research 36. However, many people do not keep a watchful eye on the mental health of cancer survivors and the patients with precancerous lesions. In the clinical observation, patients with gastrointestinal diseases may be prone to suffer from psychologic changes, such as anxiety, depression and etc. On the other hand, patients with encephalopathy or psychological illnesses may have different degrees of gastrointestinal dysfunction and appetite alteration. Therefore, depression can be one of the potential factors of poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients 33. Stress and depression are related to many gastrointestinal diseases and depression may also be a precipitating factor of gastric cancer 37. Chronic stress is a widely acknowledged as a predisposing factor of depression.",6cff22be-1a30-4449-8eed-da27784c668d
38,discussion1," Extensive research shows chronic stress induces several behavioral alterations such as depressive-like behavior. During the development of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) to gastric cancer, clinical gastrointestinal function and appetite changes could be easier to figure out, compared to psychological condition changes, such as depression-like behavior.  To find out whether Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats show behavior alteration, we applied methyl N' nitro N nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) free drinking combined with intermittent fasting to establish a Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) model, and observed their behaviors. methyl N' nitro N nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), a chemical mutagenesis agent and carcinogen, is currently recognized as a common drug to widely and effectively establish chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) and GC models in previous studies.",d0e9292e-33ba-4d35-8214-a64f19ac461c
39,discussion2," Long-term intake of methyl N' nitro N nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) can easily induced chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), and eventually form gastric cancer. According to the results of open field, Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) presented less general locomotion and preferred to stay along the sides of the field, showing depression-like behaviors. To further confirm whether they suffer from depression, we assess by sucrose preference test. Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats did not show the loss of reward pleasure, which indicated they did not suffer from depression. We consider that long-term illness might lead to insufficient energy supply in the body, which may be displayed by weakened motility. However, it may also be caused by other factors, such as pain and other uncomfortable conditions induced by Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL).",9fb6875d-f158-47ab-ae94-e51433d8e155

Depending on the results of the open field, Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rats presented less general locomotion as Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats. Interestingly, the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rats prefer to stay in one quadrant of field. Under chronic stress, Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rats feel lonelier and down, and experience loss of curiosity to explore the environment. All control rats showed increased curiosity and activity.",ad0214c9-c77e-4c09-94cf-6182efeee40f
41,discussion4," As expected, Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats under chronic stress lose the pleasure of reward and induce depression-like behaviors.  We administrated a dynamic observation to further confirm the influence of chronic stress in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats. Histopathological diagnosis is the golden standard. Through dynamic observation, we found the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) and Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rats showed different histopathology among 28 weeks. In the beginning, they all presented the histopathological characteristics of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), for example, atrophy of the gland in the stomach. The degree of atrophy is calculated by the reduction of intrinsic glands among the stomach. When Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rats appeared the moderate degree of atrophy in the 12th week, Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats stayed on the mild degree.",9c05153d-89f7-4305-9700-61ec471b298a
42,discussion5," In the 16th week, some of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats under chronic stress appeared to have severe atrophy, while Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats remained on the mild and moderate degree. In addition, Dys and IM are important assessment points of histopathology. IM might act as an alternative marker, to evaluate the risk of GC and malignant potential 38. We observed Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats occurred Dys and mild intestinal metaplasia in the 24th week, but Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rats appeared one month earlier and it reached the sever degree in the 28th week. The injury of capillaries and angiogenesis are special indicators in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL). In the early stage of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL), the capillaries in gastric mucosa were high-density, while the density of capillaries would drop off by degrees.",9ed6e81a-83d3-4d2c-bbe7-adee866d0b81
43,discussion6," In the late stage of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL), angiogenesis would appear. We found early vascular lesions in the 16th week in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) and Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) groups, but those in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) group are more prominent. Furthermore, the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) group possessed abundant capillaries in the 20th week, one month earlier than the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) group. Interestingly, the more serious lesion area had more abundant capillaries. Some researchers found that in the area of gastric cancer, the overall incidence of genetic instability (genetic instability (GIN)) would have a significant increase with lymphatic or vascular invasion 39.",95a1b032-b6c2-4929-ac6e-aaae9a5c99c8
44,discussion7," In our previous studies, we hypothesized that the blood metastasis might happen before the cancer cells infiltrating the basement membrane in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL). Based on our previous researches, we believed abundant capillaries might evolve into neovascular cancer in the future. Moreover, with the accumulation of long-term stress the process of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) became faster after 24 weeks. The two rats that suffered from gastric tumors in our study could be of evidence. All in all, our findings proved that under chronic stress stimulation, the process of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) is increased which may easily lead to tumorigenesis. Some studies indicated that metaplasia appears to be an adaptive response 33 and acts as self-protection. Chronic inflammation may also be an important factor.",6107ab7a-4885-4c96-a249-2de58d686619
45,discussion8,"  Thus, we assessed the inflammatory reaction among three groups to investigate whether depression influences the development of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) by mediating inflammation. In our study, gastric mucosa had caused an inflammatory response around the 12th week and it continued throughout the whole process. Combined with the results of the Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests, we found that the concentration of IL-6 and TNF-α, as the inflammatory cytokines, showed significant changes in serum, while the post-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10, showed no significant changes among the three groups. In this study, higher TNF-α and IL-6 levels reflected the inflammation in the whole body. TNF-α and IL-6 may be significant and observable targets. Somatostatin (SS), is an important gastrointestinal hormone which could inhibit gastrin secretion 40.",09abf80b-88ca-4eea-83a9-f2ecd42b4864
46,discussion9," In our studies, SS levels expression in serum were significantly increased in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) group which is a key target during the process of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) and Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL). Inflammation is an important factor in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL). Studies have shown that NF-κB may facilitate tumorigenesis by regulating inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. P65 is the most pivotal subunit of NF-ΚB and the activation of NF-κB contributes to Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) 41. Our results showed that chronic stress significantly increases the expression of p65 in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats.  Inflammation contributes to the tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis. P53 is a major tumor suppressor, which serves a major role in metabolism, regardless of whether it is in normal or cancer cells 42, 43.",1c5b0cdb-e7d3-4005-832d-690ebf8747bf
47,discussion10," The increasing dysregulation of p53 would increase the risk of gastric cancer 44. In our previous studies, we had reported that p53 proteins were up-regulated in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats 1. In this research, we found that chronic stress significantly increased the expression of p53. Moreover, Bcl-2 and Bax are two major proliferation- and apoptosis-related factors. Bcl-2 inhibits the cell's apoptosis, while Bax antagonistically stimulates it 45-47. In our previous studies, we found Bcl-2/Bax ratio was abnormal in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats and suggested that mutation of activating p53 depends on autophagy dysfunction. From our newfound results, the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly increased and Bax was significantly decreased in both the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) and Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) groups.",b8c220eb-d214-4c0b-8529-a12d96e535a8
48,discussion11," As expected, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio significantly increased in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rats. All data considered, our findings suggest that chronic stress increases the inflammation and the risk of tumorigenesis as well as influence the cell proliferation and apoptosis in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats.  As we know, the most typical lesion of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) and Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) gastric mucosa is atrophy. The atrophy of gastric mucosa leads to a corresponding decrease in the secretion of hormones in mucosal cells. Inflammation may influence its production and secretion. Therefore, we assessed the concentration of the gastrointestinal hormone, Ghrelin, in serum. Ghrelin acts as an indicator to assess the function of glands because it is mainly secreted by the gastric mucosa 48.",e59bb8ca-db7f-4623-b636-256ca6683e05
49,discussion12," During the entire modeling period, the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) and Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rats had binge eating and intermittent anorexia, of which the change in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rats is more obvious. Therefore, feeding stability is an important part of gastric mucosa self-regulation and protection.  Ghrelin can affect appetite, energy balance, gastric motility, mediate inflammation and gastric acid secretion 48. However, the relationship among Ghrelin, Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL), and Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) with depression has not been investigated. Previous studies indicated that Ghrelin is closely related to upper gastrointestinal diseases 49. Inflammation and atrophic changes associated with infection may result in impaired biosynthesis of Ghrelin, resulting in decreased blood levels of Ghrelin 50.",e0a19d1a-2949-4791-a41c-8bafbed47f0c
50,discussion13," While Ghrelin has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic functions, altered expression of Ghrelin can reflect the degree of gastric inflammation or the degree of gastric atrophy to some extent 51, contributed to judge the severity of the disease. Some researchers suggested the concentrations of serum Ghrelin were associated with the risk of gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma (gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA)) and esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma (esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma (EGJA)) 34. Ghrelin also plays a key role in mood disorders 52. Some studies found chronic peripheral administration of Ghrelin could alleviate depression-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS), and indicated Ghrelin had antidepressant effect 52. In this study, serum Ghrelin was significantly lower in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rats than in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) rats.",16150fac-0292-4917-8f1d-0c9a2e7dd9b9
51,discussion14," However, we found overexpression in the gastric mucosa of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)+chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rats. We suggested that may be the result of a compensatory response in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL), to remedy for the deficiency of secretion induced by atrophy. However, the effect of Ghrelin in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) is still uncertain. Ghrelin may play different role under physiologic or pathologic conditions. Ghrelin could be secreted by organs such as the stomach, small and large intestines, kidney, brain, the lungs and so on. Depression might influence inflammatory reactions that aggravate the development of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) by altering the production, secretion and bond of Ghrelin and its receptors. Ghrelin and GKN2 may have different functions under physiological and pathological conditions. Gastric mucosa is the main point of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL).",4510612d-0412-41d9-a52c-db0ef0caaef0
52,discussion15," Menheniott indicated frequently loss of GKN2 expression is related to the pathogenesis of GC 53. In some studies, Ghrelin and GKN2 might have anti-inflammatory effect 53, which were tumor suppressor genes. Our research suggests that the inflammation in gastric mucosa during Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) stage, might result in the low expression of Ghrelin and GKN2. However, Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) might increase the expression in blood vessels vicariously to compensate for the inadequate secretion of gastric mucosa. GKN2 and Ghrelin might serve potential roles in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL), as well as markers of neovascularization in tumors.  Based on our findings, the aggravation of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) could lead to weight loss. We considered that inflammation could mediate the gastrointestinal hormone secretion in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL), which might influence feeding function and appetite alteration, and result in weight loss.",c20e6181-2cc4-400c-88bc-1339dd55edbd
53,discussion16," The mechanisms of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) are still uncertain. As for the treatment of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL), there are no specific medications or treatments for it. Thus, reducing the risk factor seems to be more critical in the process of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL). We suggested that Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) would increase inflammatory cytokines and it would be more intense under chronic stress, accelerating the progress of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) to GC. Chronic persistent inflammatory reaction in the Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) may damage the body's normal immune function. That is one of the most important factors affecting the occurrence and development of gastric cancer. Further study is needed.

Inflammation, autophagy, and the neuroendocrine system have a close relationship with the development of Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL). Chronic stress would increase the inflammation, impact the gastrointestinal hormone secretion, break the balance of the cell proliferation and apoptosis, involve in feeding function and appetite alteration, and result in accelerating the process of gastric precancerous lesions in rats. In addition, GKN2 and Ghrelin may serve potential roles in Gastric precancerous lesions (GPL), as well as the markers of neovascularization in tumors.
