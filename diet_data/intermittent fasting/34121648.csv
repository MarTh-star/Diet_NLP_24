0,background0," Intermittent fasting is a time-restricted feeding strategy with proven health benefits, which is based on multiple metabolic and endocrine changes, in several patient populations and healthy participants. In the pediatric intensive care unit (Pintensive care unit (ICU)), artificial feeding is usually administered 24 hours a day, although solid evidence supporting this practice is lacking. This discards the potential benefits of fasting in this population. We hypothesize that intermittent nutrition with a focus on an overnight feeding interruption (intermittent fasting), as compared with 24-hour continuous nutrition, is a feasible and safe strategy, with potential benefits, for critically ill children.",aff5aefd-1b70-4aa3-8a0a-58ee80ba5dba
1,background1,  Objective  The aim of the Continuous versus Intermittent Nutrition in Pediatric Intensive Care randomized controlled trial (randomized controlled trial (RCT)) is to investigate a strategy of intermittent nutrition with a focus on an overnight feeding interruption period versus 24-hour nutrition during the first 14 days in the Pintensive care unit (ICU). ,aa98f1e8-7a0d-41e7-a1f3-215516a2ae65

The computer algorithm allocates every consecutive eligible patient to 1 of the 2 treatment arms in a one-to-one allocation ratio using permuted blocks of 10. Patients will be stratified into 3 age groups: neonates (≤44 weeks PMA), infants (<1 year), and children (≥1 year).  Blinding  It was considered not feasible to blind treating physicians and patients for the allocated treatment during the time window of the randomized intervention.

To optimize protocol compliance, reminders for study interventions and measurements will be incorporated into the electronic patient data management system. Moreover, the research team will provide a daily follow-up of all included patients.  Nutritional Support  Caloric Intake  During the study, nutritional intake will be provided to both allocation groups according to the current pediatric critical care nutrition guidelines [5,20,21]. In all patients from both study arms, EN will be started as soon as possible (<24 hours), provided that they are hemodynamically stable and without formal contraindications.",1777709b-f7d9-40bf-b18d-949b45e78efd

Caloric goals will be calculated upon admission according to the body weight–based or body weight and length–based Schofield equation for the estimation of resting energy expenditure (REE) [22]. In line with the international nutritional guidelines for critically ill children, caloric intake is targeted to reach 1×resting energy expenditure (REE) at the end of the first week [5]. After 1 week, caloric target intake increases further to a maximum caloric intake of 1.3×resting energy expenditure (REE) for older children and adolescents and up to 2×resting energy expenditure (REE) for neonates and infants [20]. The research team will provide nutritional advice based on the standard protocol on a daily basis.",a68fa245-34ff-48a2-b298-b08578e96be8

If standard PN formulas are not suitable or are contraindicated for the patient, a tailor-made PN formula can be ordered by the dietician. To reduce the risk of refeeding syndrome on the first day of PN, half the target amount of PN will be provided [24].",6fdccfd8-9114-4f7a-8d03-317a0286dc57
14,methods12,"  Intervention Group: Intermittent Nutrition  For patients randomized to the intermittent nutrition group (intervention group), all nutritional support will be provided during the day and withheld during the overnight feeding interruption period. The overnight feeding interruption period will be designed in an age-dependent manner. The feeding interruption period will be from 2 AM to 10 AM in neonates (≤44 weeks PMA), from 12 AM until 10 AM in infants (<1 year), and from 10 PM to 10 AM in children (≥1 year), as shown in Figure 2. The daily planned nutritional intake will be provided during the condensed feeding period over the day. The starting time of nutritional intake is set to 10 AM to facilitate procedures that require fasting to be performed in the morning. PN (beyond day 7, if necessary) will be provided during the daily age-dependent feeding periods and tapered over 1 hour during the starting and stopping of PN to reduce the risk of swift metabolic shifts (Figure 2) [25,26].",1172ada9-efeb-4309-9f71-75ad4a7b53fc

Planned feeding interruptions exclude interruptions because of clinical intensive care unit (ICU) care (eg, interventions such as intubation and surgical procedures). Feeding interruptions, timing, and reason will be recorded in the database. PN (beyond day 7, if necessary) will be provided continuously for 24 hours a day without interruption (Figure 2).  Medication and Supplementation  In all patients, medication will be provided in sodium chloride–based intravenous fluids instead of glucose-based intravenous fluids unless contraindicated. Medication and fluids can also be administered during the overnight feeding interruption period.",8a5f0915-c2e3-4660-bfc9-335c93977f9e
17,methods15," If EN is insufficient (<80% target intake) during the first week, parenteral trace elements, minerals, and vitamins will be administered daily to all patients in both treatment groups similarly [27]. Intravenous micronutrient substitution will be stopped when patients receive at least 80% of their caloric needs via the enteral route.  Blood Glucose Management  Upon request of the national ethical review board (CCMO) on account of safety concerns, for patients in the intervention group, a glucose intake infusion will be provided during the overnight feeding interruption period (1.0 mg/kg/minute in neonates and 0.5 mg/kg/minute in infants) to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. In children aged >1 year, no baseline glucose infusion during the overnight feeding interruption period will be provided unless clinically indicated. Glucose level measurements will be performed at least once daily during the feeding period, regularly during fasting intervals and when clinically indicated.",ce4c6a60-247f-4653-9538-15efa374b448
18,methods16," Blood glucose management will be performed according to the local protocol. In short, blood glucose levels will be targeted from 4.0 to 7.8 mmol/L in all age groups. In patients with hyperglycemia (glucose >10 mmol/L) in 2 measurements (with 1 hour between measurements), the glucose intake will be first reduced, and if this is not sufficient, a continuous insulin infusion will be started using a stepwise nurse-driven glucose control protocol. If the blood glucose levels are <2.6 mmol/L, a bolus of 1 mL/kg glucose 10% will be provided and the baseline glucose infusion will be increased until the blood glucose level is >4.0 mmol/L. The glucose levels will be measured again within 30 minutes and 1 hour of treatment. In patients randomized in the intermittent group, if insulin is provided, this will be stopped 1 hour before the start of the overnight feeding interruption period.  Other Procedures and Guidelines  No other medical treatments were prescribed in the study protocol.",21b331d4-b5d9-4526-9c81-bad2f2fe5eb6
19,methods17," The patients will be weaned from the ventilator and from hemodynamic support according to standardized guidelines. As the timing of Pintensive care unit (ICU) discharge to a regular ward may be affected by the availability of beds in regular wards, which could induce bias, we will analyze the time to discharge from Pintensive care unit (ICU) as the time to being ready for discharge from Pintensive care unit (ICU). A patient is considered ready for discharge as soon as all clinical conditions for Pintensive care unit (ICU) discharge have been fulfilled (no longer in need of, or at risk of, vital organ support).  Per-Protocol Stop of Study  A switch to oral intake will be made as soon as it is deemed safe by the clinician responsible for the patient.  The study intervention will last until admission day 14, until the child could be fed by mouth (oral feeding), or until discharge from the Pintensive care unit (ICU), whichever comes first.",758c5bcc-72cc-4758-b2f4-6e87d2043c9d
20,methods18," After day 14, the intervention will stop, and nutritional support will be provided according to standing orders when oral intake remains insufficient.  Discontinuation of the Study Intervention  We defined a stopping rule (no-go) for individual patients to be withdrawn from the study who develop the following:  Hypoglycemia (<2.6 mmol/L) with clinical symptoms (eg, pallor, transpiration, irritability, lethargy, loss of consciousness, and convulsions) or severe hypoglycemia (<2.2 mmol/L) and who are resistant to parenteral glucose administration; resistance is defined as no elevation of glucose within 1 hour after parenteral glucose bolus (1 mL/kg glucose 10%) administration and elevation (double) of standard glucose infusion via the standard local protocol  Acute, nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (ie, intestinal perforation and necrotizing enterocolitis) not attributed to an anatomical substrate (eg,",1b4b8590-b5c1-44d2-bf32-f37fc69c58d1

Patients readmitted >48 hours after Pintensive care unit (ICU) discharge after participation in the ContInNuPIC study will not be eligible for reinclusion and will be fed at the discretion of the attending physician.  Study Blood Samples  For all patients, daily plasma glucose levels will be measured and analyzed at the bedside using a blood gas analyzer (ABL90 FLEX PLUS, Radiometer) or point of care meter (Accu-Chek Inform II, Roche Diabetes Care), and daily ketone levels (3-β-hydroxybutyrate) will be measured using the StatStrip Glucose/Ketone meter (Nova Biomedical).",014917d5-1c0c-4a7a-98b0-7412aac796d0
22,methods20," In the intermittent feeding group, glucose and ketone levels will be measured more frequently during the feeding interruption period (Figure 2).  Additional blood samples for other analyses of metabolism (eg, glucagon, insulin, and free fatty acids) and circadian rhythm (eg, gene expression and cortisol and melatonin) will be taken upon intensive care unit (ICU) admission and on days 3, 7, and 14 (Figure 2). The blood samples for metabolism will be collected using serum-separating tubes in both fasted (before 10 AM) and fed states (before 10 PM, 12 AM, or 2 AM, depending on the age group) for the intervention group or at similar time points for the continuous group. The blood samples for circadian rhythm will be collected in EDTA tubes every 4 hours during a 24-hour period (a total of 7 samples per 24 hours). The blood samples for gene expression will be collected in PAXgene RNA tubes (PreAnalytiX) once daily on the selected days at 10 AM.",cdae1684-824c-4230-aaab-e119d6f2ba9a

Owing to ethical considerations, the number of blood samples will be calculated using the body weight of the individual patient to ensure a maximum of 5% of blood volume for the entire study.  After collection, the blood samples will be immediately stored in a refrigerator. Within 24 hours after collection, the blood samples from serum-separating tubes and EDTA tubes will be centrifuged at 20 °C, and serum or plasma will then be separated and stored at −80 °C for future measurements. The PAXgene tubes will not be centrifuged and will be first stored at −20 °C for 1 day before storage at −80 °C to prevent breakage of the tubes. In addition, plasma phosphate, magnesium, and potassium levels will be determined in residuals of clinical plasma samples by the clinical chemical laboratory on days 0 to 4, 7 to 10, and 14.",d3de4427-02c9-4e66-a738-1bf6dc16c38a
24,methods22,"  Circadian Rhythm Measurements  The circadian rhythm is expected to be affected by the feeding strategy. Electroencephalography, electrooculography, and electromyography will be recorded for 24 hours on admission, day 3, day 7, and day 14 (with a margin of 1 day) or before discharge if the discharge is before day 14. Multichannel registration will be performed using a standard device (Brain RT, OSG or Morpheus, Micromed SpA). Melatonin and cortisol will be measured in the study blood samples, as melatonin and cortisol both have a clear relationship with circadian rhythms [28,29]. The blood samples used for gene expression analysis may be used to determine the internal time of peripheral blood mononuclear cells [30]. The difference between this internal time and the time of blood draw is a measure of circadian disturbances.",38cfbf51-766f-4d52-9e69-f4b5309b8352
25,methods23," In addition to the blood samples, salivary melatonin and cortisol levels will be measured to evaluate the possibility of measuring the circadian rhythm in saliva [31]. As ambient light and sound may affect and thus confound circadian rhythm [32,33], quantitative light and sound measurements will be taken at the bedside during intensive care unit (ICU) stay. All routinely monitored vital signs (including heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, perfusion index, body temperature, central venous pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide, arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and electrocardiogram waveforms) will be stored at 1 Hz to 200 Hz intervals for further analysis.  Data Handling and Record-Keeping  Data will be collected electronically in a pseudonymized electronic case record form (eCRF) with an audit trail unambiguously linked to the source file using the OpenClinica clinical data management system (OpenClinica Community; version 3.12.2; OpenClinica LLC).",a968fb2c-ac85-4064-829e-dde935257f24

The duration (in minutes) and the cause of interruption of EN delivery will be recorded. The data will be manually transferred into and checked for accuracy in the eCRF by the research team. Extensive range and consistency checks will be performed by the monitor of the study. All systemically administered medications, analyses of routine clinical chemistry, and whole blood glucose levels during the stay in Pintensive care unit (ICU) will be registered in the electronic patient file to be retrieved after completion of the study.

All original records, such as consent forms, case report forms, and relevant correspondence, will be archived according to national regulations.  Outcome Measures  Primary End Points  The primary outcome of this study will be the feasibility of a daily feeding and fasting cycle (intermittent feeding strategy) compared with a continuous 24 hours per day feeding strategy in critically ill children. The primary outcome is defined as the difference in ketosis (3-β-hydroxybutyrate levels) between the groups under the condition of noninferiority regarding caloric intake.

Adjustment for baseline risk factors, including the diagnostic group, age group, severity of illness, and severity of nutritional risk, will only be used for secondary analyses. Multiple imputation will only be used in secondary analyses to deal with missing data for confounders.",1bba2c01-bdbd-4c71-9af0-8982a338c763
38,methods36," For all end points, differences will be considered statistically significant when the 2-sided P value is <.05 or when the 1-sided P value is <.025 in the case of noninferiority tests, without correcting for multiple testing.  Primary Outcomes  To assess a significant difference in ketosis between the 2 arms, a 2-tailed t test will be performed on the patient means of the highest ketone levels in each fasting period (or similar time point in the control group). A linear mixed model will be used to assess the noninferiority of caloric intake (repeatedly measured over time) in the intervention group, with a noninferiority margin of 33%.  Secondary Outcomes  The statistical analysis plan for secondary outcomes will be published separately. In short, the safety of the intervention will be assessed by comparing the incidence of both severe and resistant hypoglycemic events and severe gastrointestinal complications using the Cox proportional hazard analysis.",531f3e77-72a3-4feb-940d-c98a5a1a6d0b
39,methods37," Feeding intolerance will be analyzed using a mixed effects logistic model. Moreover, mixed models will be used for the assessment of other longitudinal data such as analyses of the course of ketones and other metabolic markers. Kaplan-Meier plots will be used to document time-to-event effects, and the time-to-event effect size will be estimated using the Cox proportional hazard analysis. All time-to-event analyses will be performed on data censored at 30 days. As death is a competing risk for the duration of care outcomes, nonsurvivors will be censored beyond the longest duration of such care required for survivors.  Sample Size Calculation  To provide a careful estimate of the number of patients required to answer whether the intervention is feasible, we based the sample size on a (1) a fasting response with ketogenesis and (2) sufficient nutritional intake.  We calculated the sample size to detect a fasting response with ketogenesis.",4300927a-2a2e-4a29-b5c4-1fcf9893f1f4
40,methods38," In adults who are critically ill (n=70), 12 hours of fasting increased ketones compared with full feeding periods (ketones +0.47, SD 0.07 mmol/L; P<.001) [40]. In a study of healthy children, ketones increased from 0.08 mmol/L in the fed state to 0.34 mmol/L (90% CI 0.02-1.78 mmol/L) after 15 hours of fasting [41]. Using these data, we assumed baseline ketones of 0.10 mmol/L (fed state) and 0.20 mmol/L in the fasted state, with an SD of 0.16 mmol/L. To perform additional per-protocol analysis, we increased the sample size by 30%. Ultimately, the sample size of 140 should be able to detect, with at least 90% power (2-tailed power) and 95% certainty, the assumed increase in mean ketone levels of 0.10 mmol/L. Regarding nutritional intake, we considered a reduction in cumulative (caloric) intake, corrected for Pintensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, of >33% in the intervention group as clinically relevant based on the currently available literature [2].",5f0077df-91ca-45b7-892f-42e8e0266cdc
41,methods39," The sample size (N=140, 70 per arm) is expected to be able to detect, with at least 80% power (1-tailed power) and 80% certainty, a reduction of 33% in cumulative caloric intake. ",745d189e-42f1-4488-9cd2-1eecfa1b32e2

43,discussion0," Hypothesis  Although solid evidence for the superiority of continuous feeding over intermittent feeding is lacking, almost all critically ill children worldwide are fed 24 hours a day. This is assumed to result in an improved nutritional intake with fewer gastrointestinal and metabolic complications. However, this approach conceals the fact that a fasting response might be beneficial for the convalescence of critical illness.  We hypothesize that in critically ill children, intermittent feeding with an overnight fasting period will lead to increased ketogenesis without lowering the daily total nutritional intake. Moreover, we hypothesize that this overnight fasting strategy will not affect feeding intolerance, glycemic control, or safety. This hypothesis is currently being tested in this study in a large tertiary referral Pintensive care unit (ICU) (Erasmus MC Sophia Children’s Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands).",562d7eca-a148-43d5-bfec-76f60cb59456
44,discussion1,"  The Potential of an Intermittent Feeding Strategy in Pediatric Critical Illness  An important feature of the intermittent feeding strategy that is hypothesized to contribute to the beneficial effects is the transition to ketone body metabolism [42]. This ketone body metabolism contributes to the conservation of brain function and stimulation of several cellular pathways involved in stress resistance, neuroplasticity, and mitochondrial biogenesis [15]. The activation of autophagy, stimulated by the fasting state [43,44], is hypothesized to exert beneficial effects as well, as this is a process that is crucial for cellular function and integrity and recycling of macronutrients and metabolites [45-47]. Moreover, if the fasting period is implemented during the night, it might help preserve the circadian rhythm, as nutrient intake, or the fasting response, is the most important entrainment signal for the peripheral clock system [48,49].",327ac13e-2262-4635-b383-a812ddaae248
45,discussion2," This preservation of the circadian rhythm might be crucial in the treatment of critically ill patients, as the circadian rhythm is believed to be often disrupted in patients who are critically ill, and this is associated with impaired outcomes [50-54]. The preservation of circadian rhythm is hypothesized to improve sleep and metabolism, and it might even exert beneficial effects on tissue repair, immune response, and delirium risk [15]. A possible problem with implementing an overnight fast is the higher nutritional load during the daytime that is needed to reach the same caloric goals. However, only feeding during the daytime and thus delivering nutrition at a time when the body is attuned to food processing and nutrient uptake, might actually improve the feeding tolerance and glycemic control of patients who are critically ill [15].",ec772a0e-0453-4a75-b9c5-3d6675b7e5a3
46,discussion3,"  In addition to the hypothesized beneficial effects because of the transition to a fasting response and preservation of the circadian rhythm, intermittent fasting might also have other beneficial effects. Reperfusion injury, muscle weakness, and immune response are believed to benefit from intermittent fasting as well [15]. Thus, intermittent fasting might be a favorable treatment option for critically ill children.  Strengths and Limitations  An important strength of this study is that the data collection is extensive, which will allow us to carefully correct for possible confounders in the analysis and further investigate the possible underlying beneficial mechanisms of intermittent feeding. Moreover, the studied patient population is very heterogeneous, which makes the findings generalizable to the general Pintensive care unit (ICU) population.  However, this study has some limitations that should be addressed.",98048813-f5a5-4f77-b87a-8ee5280eaea4
47,discussion4," One of the limitations is the relatively small sample size, which does not allow for the drawing of conclusions regarding the effect on clinical outcomes. If this study shows that an intermittent feeding strategy with overnight fasting is safe and feasible, a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be necessary to investigate its impact on clinical outcomes. Another limitation of this study is that some of the secondary outcome measures will not be performed in all patients, as some measurements (such as circadian rhythm measurements) are not suitable for patients who are very critically ill.  Conclusions  An intermittent feeding strategy with an overnight fasting period would potentially be capable of providing a fasting response while still providing sufficient nutritional intake, thereby improving clinical outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate such an intermittent feeding strategy in critically ill children.",0b16480c-3d99-4285-b344-2b06ba474c22
