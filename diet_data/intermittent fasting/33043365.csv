0,methods0," This study used a systematic review and a meta-analysis of PRISMA's preferred reporting items as a guide for reporting research results (25, 26).  Data Source and Search Strategy  Articles were identified by searching through three electronic databases, i.e., PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library until October 2020. Two reviewers (C.L. and X.L.) independently evaluated articles' eligibility, and the inconsistencies shall be made by the corresponding author (F.Y.).

Data Extraction and Study Quality Assessment  Two investigators independently extracted the relevant data from the eligible studies using predesigned forms. Data included study, publication year, country, study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, total number of participants, participant details, study duration, intervention details and control groups, baseline patient characteristics (mean age, sex), body composition, BP, glycemic control, and lipid panel.

3,methods3," When necessary, we emailed the corresponding author to acquire study details.  Quality Assessment and Publication Bias  The researchers used Cochrane Collaboration's bias risk tool to evaluate the quality of the methodology included in the studies. According to the criteria of the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews, the bias risk of each item is classified as low, high, or unclear (27).  Data Statistical and Analysis  Effect estimates were expressed as weighted mean differences (weighted mean difference (WMD)) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Inter-study heterogeneity was tested using the Higgins I2 statistic, and I2 > 50% indicated significant statistical heterogeneity. The heterogeneity of the study and measurement of effect estimates were determined using the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the differences before and after IF intervention.",5873d5ec-16d7-4b54-8be0-424754361958
4,methods4," Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots; formal testing was conducted with Egger's test (28), and a sensitivity analysis was also performed. We used STATA 16 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA) for the statistical analyses.  In order to determine the influence of IF on various effect indicators, it is necessary to change the mean value before and after intervention as well as the SD of the changes. Therefore, we used a method outlined in the Cochrane handbook (27, 29) to determine the SD of changes between time points. SDchange = √[SDbaseline2+ SDfinal2- (2 × R × SDbaseline× SDfinal)]. In addition, we performed some conversion of data units through international calculation formulas to ensure that results are clinically significant. ",2d5060e9-5acb-4c12-9333-dd089456ba53

A total of 9,087 articles were part of the initial database search (PubMed: 6128, EMBASE: 40, Cochrane Library: 2919), after the removal of 1,540 duplicate articles. After filtering the titles and abstracts to exclude irrelevant articles, we found 106 articles that met the topic of interest. The full texts of the 106 records were reviewed. Of them, 60 records were excluded for the following reasons: data not available (n = 15), literature review, letter, or case report (n = 34), unrelated to relevant predictive factors (n = 2), related to protocol (n = 2), and meta-analyses (n = 7). Finally, 46 articles from the database searches were included in the meta-analysis (12, 22, 31–75). A total of 2,681 participants were randomized in the IF intervention group (n = 1,423) and the control group (n = 1,258).",5c8327ea-e8bf-4f6a-a36b-b1708242d9fe

Regarding funnel plot symmetry and Egger's test, p = 0.711 (Figure 10D).  Sensitivity Analysis  In order to determine the impact of each individual study on the effect index, we used a sensitivity analysis in our meta-analysis. Finally, we did not observe the significant effects of any individual study (Supplementary Figures 1–4). ",6f681fa3-b134-4f84-a1c6-f9ab33ea4056
14,discussion0," In this study, 46 articles with 55 arms were systematically reviewed to evaluate the effects of IF on CMRFs. The pooled analysis showed that IF had significantly reduced body composition (weight, WC, FM, and BMI), BP (SBP, DBP), lipid panel (TC, TG), and improved glycemic control by reducing FBG, Fins, and HOMA-IR; however, it did not affect the HbA1c level and lipid profile (LDL-C and HDL-C).  Comparison With Other Systematic Reviews  Compared with the previous six systematic reviews of IF on cardiac metabolic risk-related indicators, the meta-analysis has obvious distinction and added novel value: First, there were three RCT (76–78) and three non-RCT articles (79–81) in the previous meta-analysis. We included only RCTs that represented the highest level of scientific evidence. Second, there were 30 (77), 19 (79), 28 (80), 10 (76), 15 (81), and 15 articles (78) included in the previous six meta-analyses on IF. We pooled the results of 46 articles to estimate the impact of IF on CMRFs.",befec0c2-9bd9-44b7-a0c9-0e3cb960430d
15,discussion1," Third, some studies have focused on metabolic drivers, such as abnormal adipocytokine (81), dysglycemia (76, 77), blood pressure (79), blood lipids (80), and inflammatory factors (78). However, we provided the most comprehensive CMRF indicators, including body weight, blood sugar, blood lipids, and blood pressure. Finally, we also included studies with participants who had a range of subject types, including obese, sedentary, overweight, and healthy-weight adults, as well as those with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic liver disease. In addition, we included baseline levels of changes, rather than absolute levels of metabolic indicators, so as to assess the true impact of IF on these parameters, regardless of the health status of participants.  Effects of Body Composition  Overall, in terms of body composition, there was a significant positive correlation between BMI and weight loss during IF (i.e., the higher the starting BMI, the greater the weight loss during the fasting period).",7b29cf43-c8c5-4014-b548-408cfe02d17a
16,discussion2," This suggests that IF may be more effective for people with a higher BMI. The results for the effect of IF on body composition were similar to those obtained in a previous meta-analysis, by (82), which involved 11 trials that found that time restricted feeding (TRF) was effective in promoting weight loss and reducing FBG compared to not limiting meal times approaches. In addition, Intermittent energy restriction (IER) was more effective in reducing weight than a regular control diet. Moreover, it was also more effective in reducing FM level than continuous energy restriction (CER) (17). In a meta-analysis on religious fasting (83), it was found that overweight participants had a greater reduction in weight and percentage of fat than normal people. A recent meta-analysis of RCTs showed that alternate day fasting (ADF) effectively lowered body composition (BMI, weight, and FM) in overweight adults within 6 months compared to the control group (84).",c2976145-8f8f-4e52-93f2-0b66afdb4df9
17,discussion3," However, in another meta-analysis of 12 RCTs, researchers confirmed that lean mass was relatively conserved in the IF group, and no significant weight reduction was identified (59). In addition, a recent study by Lowe et al. (22) on 16:8 time-restricted eating (time restricted eating (TRE)), an IF plan encouraging the consumption of all dietary intake within an 8-h eating window, demonstrated that IF does not play a significant role in weight loss in the absence of controlled food intake. In turn, it may lead to a reduction in muscle mass. There were no significant differences in FM, Fins, glucose level, HbA1C, or blood lipids between the time restricted eating (TRE) and control groups. The results of Lowe's study are contrary to the results of most studies related to fasting. This may have been brought about by the time window of fasting. Meantime, our meta-analysis is also included in this study, but a comprehensive assessment of IF in body composition is beneficial.",8d7b32b7-0f6d-4e0c-9daf-1f73b3a77ecf
18,discussion4,"  Effects of Glycemic Control  O'Keefe et al. (85) found that IF habits can improve glucose metabolism as well as reduce abdominal fat accumulation, free radical production, inflammation, and the risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. After 12 h of fasting, insulin levels drop, liver glycogen reserves are depleted, and the body begins to absorb fatty acids from fat cells to replace glucose for combustion, which improves insulin sensitivity (12, 86). In reality, the effectiveness of IF and energy restriction on the levels of FBG, insulin level, and HOMA-IR in human participants remains inconsistent.  In a recent meta-analysis of RCTs, IF-induced FBG, Fins, and HOMA-IR were more effectively controlled than with a normal diet or continuous energy restriction (CER), which was in keeping with the findings of our study. Moreover, there was also a decrease in HbA1c, but not statistically significant.",cbe20d67-f325-41ff-91d4-8ec72791d86a
19,discussion5," Compared with our findings, this analysis has a significant effect on reducing FBG and fibrin levels. However, these analyses were based on only 35 arms, whereas we included 55 arms (77). In contrast, in some studies, no significant association was found between IF and FBG (8).  Furthermore, the impaired activity of the IGF-1 axis could be the basis of numerous metabolic, biochemical, and functional alterations that characterize aging and disease (87). In a recent meta-analysis of IF and energy-restricted diets on IGF-1 levels, Rahmani et al. revealed that only fasting regimens and energy restriction to ≤ 50% normal required daily energy intake resulted in significantly reduced levels of plasma IGF-1 in human participants (76).  Effects of Glycemic Control  In the lipid module analysis, the findings of a recent meta-analysis of the effects of IF and energy-limited diet on blood lipids were similar to those in our systematic review.",55b6219f-2fa4-4964-a90f-02e74297a0bc
20,discussion6," The results showed that, compared with the control group, IF significantly reduced the concentration of TC and TG, but had no meaningful effects on HDL-C concentration (80). However, the two meta-analyses are contradictory in terms of LDL-C levels. The lack of standardization of blood lipid measurement time in individual studies may lead to changes in LDL-C concentrations in some studies. In healthy adults, the longer the week of fasting, the higher the TC, LDL-C, and other indicators (88). This meta-analysis contains the energy limitation of uninterrupted time, which may be the main reason for the difference. Although we did not observe a significant effect of IF on HDL-C concentration, some previous studies have demonstrated the effect of dietary intervention on this lipid marker. Moro et al. demonstrated a small increase in HDL-C concentrations in people who exercised for 8 weeks as part of a normal-calorie diet (43).",016aba30-3685-4252-a824-c30e3145a177
21,discussion7,"  Previous studies have shown that IF is not only beneficial in reducing the production of free radicals or weight loss; it also has several health benefits (7, 89–91). IF can cause an evolutionarily conservative adaptive cellular response, improve blood glucose regulation, enhance anti-stress ability, and inhibit inflammation between and within organs. During fasting, cells activate pathways that enhance the body's defense against oxidation and metabolic stress, as well as remove or repair damaged molecules. IF improves the healthy physiological indexes related to metabolism, which lays the foundation for improving the metabolic characteristics of the animal (91, 92). Fat is the main energy source for cells and is stored in the adipose tissue in the form of TGs after meals. During fasting, TGs are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, which are used to provide energy consumption by the organism (93).",0a5dceb4-3d34-40b5-940d-3f1def407a2c
22,discussion8,"  Although not discussed in this study, we found further interesting indicators (leptin and adiponectin secreted by adipocytes) that were used in weight control studies. A meta-analysis by Varkaneh Kord et al. (81) revealed that there was a significant reduction in serum leptin and a non-significant reduction in serum adiponectin following IF. This provides more reference indicators for the effect of IF on metabolic risk.  Effects of Blood Pressure  Blood pressure is an important metabolic index of cardiovascular disease (CVD); thus, any viable mechanism to reduce or manage vascular indices, such as blood pressure, warrants detailed investigation. The reduction of SBP (2.14 mmHg) was observed in our meta-analysis compared with the control group. In the current meta-analysis, IF was slightly more effective in reducing SBP (3.26 mmHg) than energy-restricting diets (1.09 mmHg).",d349928a-1321-4819-a528-3eac46e9c6f7
23,discussion9," The reason for this difference was that, in our study, IF was mainly used in the intervention group, while continuous energy restriction (CER) and daily diet were used in the control group.  The available data show that the increase in vascular oxidative stress and vascular inflammation is not only the mechanism of endothelial dysfunction but also the key to the pathogenesis of hypertension (94, 95); and an empirical study showed that fasting reduces hypertension (12, 89, 96). The mechanism of the decreased blood pressure may be the increase in parasympathetic activity due to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, increased norepinephrine excretion by the kidneys, and increased sensitivity of natriuretic peptides and insulin (97). Cardiovascular health benefits do not persist after termination of the IF diet. After cessation of the diet, the blood pressure values return to their initial values (98).",a5ea3565-a7bd-443a-87db-ab41699d6e64
24,discussion10,"  Although many studies have shown that IF is beneficial to human health and suitable for a wide range of metabolic diseases, this dietary model has rarely been promoted in practice. The main reason for this lack of implementation is that people are accustomed to eating three meals a day. When changing to an IF program, some people feel hungry, irritable, and lose concentration. In addition, IF has side effects in humans. Previous studies have shown that the exercise level of athletes during fasting is extremely decreased due to hypoglycemia (99); there are also disturbances in sleep architecture. A recent study by Lowe et al. (22) demonstrated that in the absence of controlled food intake, IF will lead to a reduction in muscle mass. Incorrect fasting time windows can lead to gastrointestinal diseases. In unhealthy people, using fasting therapy can lead to a decline in physical fitness.",bbc2d6b2-335a-48f1-adc9-42182f9b0927
25,discussion11," Finally, IF includes different fasting methods, time windows, and energy limitations, which require consultation with a dietitian or doctor to adopt an appropriate fasting schedule to ensure the patient's nutritional needs, while gradually reducing the time window for daily eating to prevent side effects, and simultaneously providing continuous counseling and education.  There are some limitations to this meta-analysis. As this is the case with some studies, some of the included ones have a small sample size, and there are several studies with a high risk of bias. Second, the number of long-term studies conducted is very limited, and larger long-term trials with a longer duration are needed to understand the effects of IF on weight loss and long-term weight management. Moreover, different types of IF have different characteristics in various metabolic diseases, and we did not analyze each of them individually.",e1744dac-0df7-44d6-b613-7fe1e95d714a
26,discussion12," Finally, although IF has a variety of components, a comparison with other types of IF could not be conducted due to the lack of RCT research on religious fasting and lack of data on other kinds of fasting.  Conclusion  This systematic review has demonstrated that IF may improve body composition (weight, WC, FM, and BMI) and moderate BP, TC, TG, and blood glucose, but there may be no difference regarding the LDL-C, HDL-C, and HbA1c levels; components of CMRFs are also risk factors for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD)s. Therefore, high-quality and long-term RCTs are needed to provide data on the persistence of the effect and to strengthen the certainty of the evidence.
