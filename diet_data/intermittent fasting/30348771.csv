0,introduction0,"Intermittent fasting has increased in popularity in recent years because of accumulating evidence regarding its favorable metabolic impact on various aspects of human health. Intermittent fasting can reduce cardiovascular risks and improve cardiovascular health (1–3), improve insulin sensitivity and lead to weight reduction (4), mitigate hypertension (5, 6), and reduce inflammation (7). Fasting during the holy month of Ramadan is practiced by Muslims worldwide and involves abstaining from all oral intakes between sunrise and sunset. Typically, patients with underlying disease or illness are exempted from fasting unless it is performed in a controlled environment where risks and complications are minimal or avoided. Certain individuals with T2DM who have a controlled diet or are managed using medications that do not increase the risk of hypoglycemia can fast in a safe manner.",0a78ceee-7f9e-4ff7-a95d-f89d0b134530
1,introduction1," However, fasting is not recommended in individuals with T1DM because of their particularly high risk of hypoglycemia. Some individuals with T1DM feel that they are sufficiently healthy to fast during Ramadan despite the safety concerns of their health care professionals. These cases require measured and tailored support in order to minimize potential risks (8, 9). Poorly managed fasting could cause kidney damage, including acute kidney injury secondary to dehydration, which is compounded by the concomitant use of nephrotoxic medications, and hypoglycemia when endogenous counter-regulatory mechanisms fail to match the energy expenditure. Although the benefits of planned and well-supported fasting outweigh the risks in a select group of individuals with T2DM, the primary challenge that patients with T1DM face when attempting to fast is the complete lack of glucose regulation, and thereby, the unacceptable risk of hypoglycemia and significant hyperglycemia.",61a7c90d-4eb9-4a14-a6cc-eb225954d270
2,introduction2," Because of the absence of endogenous insulin production, individuals with T1DM require exogenous insulin to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis (diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)), even in situations wherein glucose levels are not elevated (10). Although glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and negative feedback of insulin secretion are protective against fasting-induced hypoglycemia in normal physiology, they may not have the same impact in individuals with T1DM. Individuals with T1DM have an inherently higher risk of hypoglycemia due to the hypoglycemic effect of unregulated exogenous insulin therapy. Other potentially predisposing risks for hypoglycemia include impaired or loss of glucagon response to hypoglycemia in long-standing T1DM (11), increased risk of celiac disease (12), and increased risk of hypoadrenalism due to the predisposition of a shared autoimmune background (13).",0f959a60-a1d3-4081-a2db-ef45ae4f85fd
3,introduction3," A previous study on fasting in patients with poorly controlled T1DM reported wide fluctuations in glucose levels with increased hyperglycemia, more so during the eating period, and significant incidence of hypoglycemia during the fasting period (14). Kadiri and colleagues demonstrated that the rate of hypoglycemia was halved and 2-h postprandial glucose was lower after Iftar (fast-breaking meal) when using insulin lispro compared with regular human insulin in individuals with T1DM treated with basal isophane insulin who fasted during Ramadan (15); albeit risk of hypoglycemia persisting. An assessment of adolescents with T1DM who were treated with either basal-bolus or pre-mixed insulin and who attempted to fast during Ramadan reported that 61.5% of those on basal-bolus and 44% on pre-mixed insulin broke fasting due to hypoglycemia, whereas 7.6% on basal-bolus and 55% on pre-mixed insulin broke fasting due to significant hyperglycemia (16).",b9f38472-a2c6-47c2-8334-e58feb9b4ce0
4,introduction4," The current standard therapy approach for T1DM involves basal-bolus insulin treatment with multiple daily injections (multiple daily injections (MDI)) using analog insulin preparations; however, some patients with hypoglycemia or poor glycemic control may require continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)) via an insulin pump (17, 18). An observational study by Benbarka and colleagues reported a much lower rate of hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), although one patient (2%) was admitted to the hospital with significant hyperglycemia (19). Khalil and colleagues reported similar observations in patients with T1DM who fasted Ramadan while using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), with no severe hypoglycemia and less than half of the minor hypoglycemic episodes occurring during the fasting periods (20).",0c7d8dfe-4324-4846-9c3c-b6cd787b22e2
5,introduction5," In another study, Alamoudi and colleagues recruited patients with T1DM who were treated with either multiple daily injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) who wanted to fast Ramadan. Both groups achieved similar outcomes with under 10% experiencing mild hypoglycemia and around 1% experiencing severe hypoglycemia in both groups (21).  Advanced glucose monitoring systems including flash glucose monitoring (Flash) and continuous glucose monitoring (continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)) have increased in popularity in recent years because of the high level of details provided on glucose monitoring, enhanced level of accuracy, and a growing evidence base for impact and clinical utility provided by clinical trials (22–24). Flash and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems measure interstitial fluid glucose which is intrinsically delayed from blood glucose.",e0310390-c204-4146-bd4b-3e554ade3f47
6,introduction6," The primary difference between Flash and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides real-time glucose readings and alarms when glucose is low or getting low, while Flash is user-dependent and provides a glucose reading only when the user actively scans the sensor. Both systems provide trend arrows indicating predicted glucose change.  Current Gaps in the Literature Experts from various countries proposed a consensus guideline for fasting in Ramadan in people with diabetes mellitus (25), which was followed by two subsequent updates (26, 27). These guidelines point out the limited and weak evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) especially in patients with T1DM and Ramadan fasting. The recommendations in the guideline were based on opinion and personal experiences rather than being rigorously tested or evaluated in clinical trials.",e70cd0ed-8de6-4bb6-86b8-15cb815720b5
7,introduction7,"  The Epidemiology of Diabetes and Ramadan (Epidemiology of Diabetes and Ramadan (EPIDIAR)) study group, reported a large observational survey of individuals with diabetes who fasted during Ramadan. There was increased rate of acute complications in both T1DM and T2DM groups (28). The T1DM group had a 4.7-fold increase in severe hypoglycemia incidence (with or without ketoacidosis). However, 78% of patients were treated with twice-daily pre-mixed insulin. The standard of care varied significantly between participating centers with 10.3% not receiving regular diabetes care and only 68% of those in the T1DM group received Ramadan specific treatment recommendations with 67% were self-monitoring their blood glucose.  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)) has recommended the implementation of structured educational programs to enhance individuals' knowledge regarding diabetes and improve their management (29).",ded630a3-e6c8-4f6a-90ff-1640370fce57
8,introduction8," Educational programs train individuals to safely cope with specific situations, such as exercise or illness; however, there is a lack of education on fasting and insulin therapy. One of the most effective educational programs is the Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE)) course, a 5-day structured educational program for adults with T1DM to empower them to adjust their insulin dose according to grams of carbohydrates consumed in their food. Several studies have reported improved HbA1C and quality of life without an increased risk of hypoglycemia (30, 31). This UK-based educational program was adopted and adapted for use in the Kuwait region. Dasman Diabetes Institute has been endorsed by Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) UK to be the training center for Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) in the Middle East.",7bb30fb5-736f-49d5-ad2c-cd4adb0bc4a8
9,introduction9," In addition to the Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) standard curriculum, a fasting-specific educational session on safe fasting during Ramadan is conducted annually for all Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) graduates. The session seeks to gauge participants' views and preferences on fasting and reviews common foods consumed during Ramadan along with structured therapy recommendations for both multiple daily injections (MDI) and insulin pump users.  Study Hypothesis In the present study, we hypothesized that structured education and advanced glucose monitoring could facilitate safe intermittent fasting during Ramadan without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in individuals with uncomplicated T1DM.

Participants attended Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE)) structured education training, and basal insulin was reduced in a controlled fashion. Participants were assigned a sensor-augmented insulin pump or FreeStyle Libre for advanced glucose monitoring. The primary endpoint was the rate of hypoglycemia during Ramadan compared to before Ramadan. Secondary endpoints were percentage time spent <4 mmol/L, >10 mmol/L (range, 4–10 mmol/L), episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)), and acute kidney injury or hospitalization for any cause.",211caa76-ca1c-4b4e-9dab-e616cd14325e

15,methods5,"  Structured Education and Diabetes Management During Ramadan Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) course and Ramadan-specific Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) workshop were delivered in Arabic, the participants' mother tongue. Decisions on fasting during Ramadan and support during the fasting period were made using a stepped approach. One-on-one consultations were scheduled within 2 weeks before the start of Ramadan with each subject who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria and planned to fast. Expectations were set and full instructions on safe fasting were discussed. Participants deciding to proceed agreed to follow an insulin modification plan during the fasting month. They were directed to use the highest pre-Ramadan insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR)) for Iftar and to use the lowest meal insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR) for Suhoor (pre-dawn meal).",fd894c00-48af-41b0-9dd6-ca3b29a97f71

Furthermore, participants were trained to use a temporary basal tool to manage hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia when necessary. All patients treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) were given insulin pens (NovoRapid FlexPen and Lantus SoloStar pen) to use in case of pump malfunction or failure.",d92580c0-4c66-4950-8562-9fc11137be57

SMBG check was requested upon waking, at midday, at 3 p.m., before Iftar, before Suhoor, at midnight, and before going to sleep in addition to other relevant times including before driving and when feeling unwell or hypoglycemia is suspected. All included participants were invited to a 2-day educational workshop conducted by the multi disciplinary team (MDT) before the start of Ramadan. The workshop consisted of a carbohydrate counting refresher session with emphasis on the most commonly consumed foods and drinks during Ramadan. Participants were advised to break their fast when they developed hypoglycemia (SMBG <4.0 mmol/L, 72 mg/dL), when their glucose sensor indicated hypoglycemia (glucose <4.0 mmol/L, 72 mg/dL) or when hypoglycemia was impending (downward arrow with expected glucose to reach <4.",fdd82227-2cab-4cdf-a263-dbea1a4b7108

The rate of hypoglycemia was calculated as the total number of hypoglycemic episodes divided by the total number of days in each period. Glucose variability (GV) was evaluated with the coefficient of variation (CV) and the slope index (SI). The CV was calculated as the standard deviation divided by average glucose for the calculated period then multiplied by 100. SI was calculated according to the following formula:   SI=∑t0tn|dGdT|total days Where SI is slope index, t is time point, dG is change between consecutive glucose values, and dT is change in time interval for each glucose value.

Data represents means. *represent statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). ",1d494f22-7e24-400e-b814-a26d9c9fbe66
33,discussion0,"The present study met its primary and secondary endpoints and showed that it was possible for a group of individuals with uncomplicated T1DM who received structured education and used advanced glucose monitoring to safely observe intermittent fasting during the month of Ramadan without an increase in hypoglycemia and no incidence of severe hypoglycemia or significant hyperglycemia while maintaining reduced GV during the fasting month. While the EPIDIR study, demonstrated increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia/diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in those with diabetes mellitus who fasted Ramadan (28), other studies reported better outcomes in those with T1DM who fasted Ramadan following Ramadan specific education (32), used analog insulin compared to human insulin (15, 33), or used insulin pumps (19, 20, 34).",2631dbd5-15fc-4a0b-a9ad-3499b4823de8
34,discussion1," Alamoudi recently reported similar outcomes in those on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared to those on multiple daily injections (MDI) using analog insulin preparations during Ramadan fasting, though severe hypoglycaemia was reported in 1.3% (21).  Several factors contributed to the favorable outcome of our study. First, participants with uncomplicated T1DM were carefully selected for inclusion in the study, as metabolic stress and the relative state of dehydration anticipated during the fasting period could aggravate pre-existing complications. This is particularly important in those with diabetic nephropathy with reduced GFR because of the increased risk of hypoglycemia in the present cohort (35) as well as the risk of pre-renal acute kidney injury secondary to dehydration.",f635839e-ff4c-4e03-bd9e-a064c3f17e65
35,discussion2," Moreover, previous severe hypoglycemia is the strongest predictor of recurrence (36), and those with poor diabetes control may not engage safely in glucose monitoring and diabetes management during the fasting period, which increases their risk of deterioration. Second, providing all participants with Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) structured education and emphasizing food options commonly consumed during Ramadan empowered them to manage their insulin in light of the dietary changes experienced during Ramadan. Third, providing all participants with advanced glucose monitoring sensors enabled them to gain deeper insight into their glucose changes, and therefore, mitigate hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia the majority of the time. Finally, proactively modifying insulin regimens led to effective therapy with minimal hypoglycemia.",cbdccf78-af41-47b9-ac88-3f12d04c1399
36,discussion3,"  The findings in the present study are relevant to people with T1DM who choose to observe fasting during Ramadan as well as to other individuals with T1DM who intend to fast for other reasons. The study demonstrated in our cohort of people with uncomplicated T1DM who underwent structured diabetes education and used advanced glucose monitoring that they can fast safely whether treated with multiple daily injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Although the number of participants was small and the study was not a randomized trial, the safety outcomes were novel and quite encouraging in this cohort. Further validation in larger randomized controlled trials is required. In the meantime, the protocol adopted in this study could serve as a safe guiding blueprint for individuals with T1DM who intend to observe fasting.  Ethics Statement The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health (Approval No.",859f6715-df6f-43ca-80e1-87b745ef6d01
