0,abstract0," In recent years, intermittent fasting (IF), including periodic fasting and time‐restricted feeding (time‐restricted feeding (TRF)), has been increasingly suggested to constitute a promising treatment for cardiometabolic diseases (cardiometabolic diseases (CMD)). A deliberate daily pause in food consumption influences the gut microbiome and the host circadian clock, resulting in improved cardiometabolic health. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which circadian host‐microbiome interactions affect host metabolism and immunity may add a potentially important dimension to effective implementation of IF diets. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence potentially linking compositional and functional alterations of the gut microbiome with IF impacts on mammalian metabolism and risk of development of hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, and their long‐term micro‐ and macrovascular complications.",0afb1fae-b913-4f11-b069-5685e3855b94

The traditional breakfast‐lunch‐dinner pattern has been replaced by frequent snacking, large nighttime meals, and breakfast skipping. 3 , 4 Such irregular eating patterns may have an adverse effect on cardiometabolic risk factors, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia, 4 thus contributing to the rising prevalence of T2D. 1 In contrast, intentional eating with awareness of the timing and frequency of eating occasions could improve lifestyle and cardiometabolic risk factor management, 5 which can protect against the development of T2D and CVDs. 6 , 7  Intermittent Fasting Regimens.",2b11dbf8-8460-4dae-949e-48cc789daa24
4,abstract4," Intermittent fasting (IF) is a general term for a predetermined pause in the consumption of food, usually accomplished by restricted eating for 12 hours to a few days per week. 5 During this protocol, calories and macronutrients are consumed at precise times, followed by periods without food ingestion. There are different types of IF diets, ranging from relatively long fasting periods to those spanning only a few daily wake hours 5 (Table 1). One of them is alternate‐day fasting (alternate‐day fasting (ADF)), which entails alternating between regularly eating one day and refraining from eating the next day. The feeding:fasting ratio of 5:2 days, also known as periodic fasting, is characterized by cycles of extreme limitation or complete abstinence of food for two days a week, whereas food can be eaten without restrictions on the other five days of the week.",ab911983-795e-4482-97ad-a5d22577b3b4
5,abstract5," A variation of periodic fasting is the fasting‐mimicking diet (fasting‐mimicking diet (FMD)), which includes cycles of several consecutive days of low‐calorie intake. 8 A less extreme diet is time‐restricted feeding (time‐restricted feeding (TRF)), in which individuals eat their meals within a particular window of time each day, for example, fasting:feeding of 12:12 hours or 16:8 hours, respectively. The flexibility in the fasting frequency and duration enables individuals to choose their preferential eating pattern. Within the time‐restricted feeding (TRF) framework, the specific time of the day in which the food is consumed is of importance. Consuming calories during the active phase, in comparison with the resting phase, is typically associated with improved features of cardiometabolic health, probably affecting circadian rhythms. 5 , 9 , 10 , 11 Thus, it is advisable that within the time‐restricted feeding (TRF) diet, calories should be consumed during the active phase.",aa215194-ae84-43fd-9098-1053e4ea7a9c

The conflicts between studies stem from differences in restricted feeding durations (eg, 12:12, 14:10, 16:8, alternate‐day fasting (ADF) or periodic fasting), feeding time (during the active or resting phase), the amount of calories consumed during the feeding time, as well as the feeding regimens and the caloric content given to the control groups.",ea510b26-7b04-4195-a513-afd8747be10e

There are several theories hypothesizing about the mechanisms potentially underlying the possible benefits of IF diets compared to ad libitum feeding. A critical factor in many of these benefits is the “metabolic switch,” a phenomenon in which fasting causes the body to preferentially use fatty acids and ketone bodies derived from fatty acids as a fuel instead of glucose. 27 Consequently, ketone bodies can serve as signaling molecules that trigger response against oxidative and metabolic stress, as well as removal of damaged molecules. 18 , 28 Refeeding, on the other hand, results in increased levels of the incretin hormone glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) and insulin, which then enhance glucose uptake and promote tissue‐specific growth and plasticity.",26c15b88-9947-4a75-a741-3f4b0e9a19e1
10,abstract10," 18 , 28 There are ongoing efforts to identify the mechanisms by which the metabolic switch is controlled and influences the body. One of the hypotheses was that the biological clock is required for the time‐restricted feeding (TRF) impact. 29 However, it appears that time‐restricted feeding (TRF) also improves the metabolic phenotype in mice with mutations in the biological clock genes. 29 Thus, the mechanisms underlying the metabolic switch during fasting and feeding merits further investigation. More recently, IF has been shown to affect the gut bacteria, 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 which are involved in virtually all aspects of host physiology, suggesting an entirely new mechanism for the physiological impact of IF.

Through the activities of the gut microbiome, metabolites from food and environmental factors are converted into molecules that are precursors for the liver, which in turn form molecules that control the host physiological functions under various circumstances. For example, dimethylglycine and N‐acetylglycine jointly produced by the host and the gut microbiome from dietary choline can regulate weight gain after smoking cessation and may affect obesity beyond the smoking settings.",aa08e6b5-a65d-4c91-8b4d-cccea7fe8cea

Moreover, treatment of these hypertensive rats with cholic acid or TGR5 agonist attenuated elevated blood pressure, thus exceeding the need for alternate‐day fasting (ADF). 69 Fecal transplantation from alternate‐day fasting (ADF)‐fed rats to germ‐free rats prevented elevated systolic blood pressure, showing the causal role of the gut microbiome in lowering blood pressure.",b226b362-eec3-425b-9b18-4d3150a24d4e

A common manifestation in T2D patients is microvascular complications that include retinopathy and nephropathy as well as macrovascular diseases such as CVDs. IF diets, as part of nutrition therapy, have emerged as a potential intervention for managing several long‐term complications of T2D, including retinopathy, cognitive decline, heart failure, and nephropathy (Figure 2).",3a09c3ef-b170-43b0-9dcf-2e38320544e5

Examples of these differences include decreased abundance of Bifidobacterium and Turicibacter, and increased abundance of Akkermansia in diabetic retinopathy. 152 Following this observational study, Huang et al 154 presented the potential use of the gut microbiome as a discriminating biomarker of diabetic retinopathy and found that Pasteurellaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, and Gallionellaceae bacterial families were the main biomarkers distinguishing patients with T2D and patients with diabetic retinopathy, which could be helpful for diagnosis of retinopathy. Among them, the bacterial family Pasteurellaceae was specifically reduced in T2D patients with retinopathy and loss of this bacteria can serve as a predictive biomarker for the disease.",4dccdae8-4617-4bfc-a91f-c8489686161d
40,abstract40," 154 Surprisingly, Das et al 152 did not report similar changes. In relation to the IF diet regimes, a study by Beli et al 85 reported an association between the gut microbiome, dietary patterns, and diabetic retinopathy. The authors use diabetic (db/db) mice to compare the classical markers of diabetic retinopathy in mice fed with an alternate‐day fasting (ADF) diet compared to those fed ad libitum. They found that the fasting regime prevented the increase in the number of acellular retinal capillaries and reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the retina. 85 Diabetic mice fed with alternate‐day fasting (ADF) featured a significant expansion of Firmicutes phylum, and more specifically at the genus level, enhanced abundance of Oscillospira, Ruminococcus, and Turicibacter and reduced abundance of Bacteroides, Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, and Allobaculum.",332305c1-1f45-42df-97ce-6e158c2faea0
41,abstract41," 85 Along with the changes in gut microbiome composition, the authors observed that diabetic mice exhibited differences in diurnal microbial patterns compared to nondiabetic mice, which also altered in response to alternate‐day fasting (ADF). 85 Although the functional significance of the microbial oscitations following the alternate‐day fasting (ADF) diet has not been addressed in depth, this observation is important as it implies that the effect of IF diet is highly dependent on the health status of the host. Notably, alternate‐day fasting (ADF) enhanced the metabolism of primary to secondary bile acids, such as TUDCA, only in diabetic mice. The receptor for TUDCA, TGR5, is expressed in retinal ganglion cells, suggesting that microbial production of TUDCA can potentially affect the retina. Supplementation of diabetic mice with a potent agonist for TGR5 resulted in diminished diabetic retinopathy, featured by reduced retinal inflammation and lower acellular capillaries.",ede68a81-6fb3-4efc-98e2-fcf92c299d89

Sor far, it is unknown which cells in the retina respond to the secondary bile acids and the signaling pathways induced by the bile acids resulting in protection against retinal degeneration. Taken together, these results suggest that IF interventions such as alternate‐day fasting (ADF) may lead to a unique modification of the gut microbial communities and metabolites that may contribute to retinopathy diagnosis and may potentially ameliorate diabetic retinopathy.

The protective effect of alternate‐day fasting (ADF) on the cognitive functions of the diabetic mice was partly abolished upon antibiotic treatment. In order to determine how these microbes might affect cognitive function, the authors used genome‐based functional predictive analysis and metabolomics. 86 They found enrichment of primary and secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways in the alternate‐day fasting (ADF) group.",47a13f1f-6ead-4cf3-af83-9298bb226c84

Supplementation of these metabolites improved cognitive functions and insulin sensitivity in db/db mice. 86 The signaling pathways induced by the microbial metabolites, the connection to brain insulin sensitivity, and the responding cells in the brain remain to be determined. Collectively, these studies propose that gut bacterial species and metabolites induced by alternate‐day fasting (ADF) may contribute to alleviation of diabetes‐induced cognitive impairment (Figure 2) and suggest that the bacterial metabolites may modulate features of brain function even in the absence of alternate‐day fasting (ADF).

48,abstract48," Their study showed that germ‐free mice compared to conventionalized mice exhibited reduced liver production of ketone bodies. According to this study, fasting was associated with higher abundance of Bacteroides that may be responsible for the production of SCFAs, especially acetate, which may be utilized for hepatic ketogenesis, thereby providing a source of energy for the heart. 172 During fasting, the heart of germ‐free mice utilized glucose instead of ketone bodies, which was reverted to ketone body metabolism by feeding a ketogenic diet. Therefore, it is plausible that the beneficial effects of fasting on cardiac function depends, at least in part, on the presence and the ability of intestinal bacteria to enhance the generation of ketone bodies that can be oxidized by the heart 172 (Figure 2). A recent study by Mistry et al 173 suggested that the circadian clock governs the bacterial effects on the heart, including those reflected during time‐restricted feeding (TRF).",d2a2a4f0-5e2f-4e52-8fc9-0620dcd3942a

Interestingly, mice with a disrupted circadian rhythm showed perturbation in gut microbiome rhythmicity, as well as impaired ischemic cardiac healing and heart failure, even in the presence of an intact microbiome. 173 With respect to IF dietary patterns, the authors used time‐restricted feeding (TRF) diet and showed that mice fed only at the dark phase before myocardial infarction had improved cardiac function compared to mice fed only at the light phase. Thus, both the gut microbiome and time‐restricted feeding (TRF) can individually affect heart failure outcomes. 173 However, it remains to be determined whether the gut microbiome mediates the improved cardiac functions induced by time‐restricted feeding (TRF).",7d73de51-bfa2-4644-89a1-292eb6a3033e
50,abstract50,"  An additional mechanism by which the gut microbiome can impact cardiovascular health is through the gut bacterial production of trimethylamine‐N‐oxide (trimethylamine‐N‐oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O)).

53,abstract53," 189 Currently, the efficacy of IF on kidney functions and diabetic nephropathy and the involvement of the gut microbiome in this process have not been elucidated.  4 CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS  Recent studies report that during multiple IF diets, the intestinal microbiome may act as a signaling hub driving the improvement in cardiometabolic complications. However, there are several technical and conceptual obstacles that still need to be carefully taken into consideration in interpreting these studies. First, IF diets regimens are inconsistently defined across studies and the long‐term effects of IF diets were mostly undetermined. From the perspective of microbiome analyses, some studies are lacking a suitable availability of some microbial datasets and resources. Furthermore, microbiome sampling in most of the human studies analyze fecal samples and disregard regional differences in the gut microbiome composition and function along the gastrointestinal tract.",2d5867d0-9693-4bae-8f2a-fc8f8b402797
54,abstract54," Additionally, some microbiome studies feature technical differences in data acquisition and analysis modalities (eg, sample allocation, extraction, or sequencing methods) differ between studies, making comparisons between their results challenging. There is also a global inability to generalize conclusions on microbiome structural alterations across human studies, due to differences between ethnical, geographical and demographical groups and variability in body mass index, sex, age, physical activity, and other clinical parameters of the participants in different studies. In addition to technical and human individual variabilities, other differences derived from personalized uniqueness of microbiome configurations constitute a formidable challenge in generalizing such results.",88552603-6d1b-407c-872d-235e2f8fe278
55,abstract55," However, the individualized microbiome heterogeneity is not necessarily a disadvantage, because it may allow for identification and development of personalized responses to various IF interventions and forms a basis (together with a variety of host clinical and laboratory features) for personalized nutrition.  5 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES  The discovery that the gut microbiome may modulate the metabolic outcomes of IF diets may provide mechanistic explanations for the observed phenotypes as well as for the personal response to the IF regimens observed in different individuals exposed to a similar dietary intervention. Indeed, gut microbiome composition and function differ between humans and rodents following IF diets as compared to those following continuous food consumption.",eb7a35d3-743d-4e2f-8b2e-4647b6067d78
56,abstract56," In addition to the altered bacterial configuration, IF collectively leads to bacterial production of specific metabolites such as secondary bile acids, SCFAs, and ketone bodies, which may have a distinct downstream impact on host physiology and disease. Although we highlight in this review how changes in microbial configuration and metabolite production may potentially influence the clinical outcomes of different cardiometabolic abnormalities, comprehensive future research is warranted to decipher the molecular and chemical processes that mediate these effects. In addition, further research is needed to address the effect of the microbiome on additional organs such as the lung, skin, muscles, and kidneys, whose functions could also be influenced by IF diets.",da165350-1a0d-4dd7-b096-a8900ee08500
57,abstract57," 190 , 191 , 192 , 193 Moreover, it remains to be determiced what is the role of the IF‐microbiome axis in several T2D‐related complications, such as the susceptibility to fungal infections, 194 diabetic foot ulcers, and diabetic nephropathy, which account for high morbidity and mortality rates in T2D patients. 195 Another question is whether a combination of IF with a defined diet composition or food choice consumed in eating days (eg, the aforementioned 5:2 DASH diet 147 ) can provide targeted benefits for certain cardiometabolic diseases (CMD)‐related conditions. In this respect, it is worth noting that although the nutrient composition of the diet has a tremendous effect on the gut microbiome, 196 the impact on cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) has not been elucidated. Other factors such as digestibility and transit time can be modulated during multiple IF diets. However, their relevance to cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) is unclear.",05dbe08a-851a-47f9-be71-2faa4296a7be

For example, Berry et al 198 showed that postprandial responses to food vary across individuals when the same meals are given at different hours. Because the gut microbiome is involved in the personal response to food, 70 it would be reasonable to assume that the personal response to IF can also be linked to the gut microbiome. Collectively, more well‐controlled, prospective, longitudinal clinical studies are required to define the microbial alterations in different IF diets that can be further translated into clinical practice.",cd03cac0-7d0c-4684-9f58-9435dfc1b0b0
59,abstract59,"  The idea that the gut microbiome is affected by IF diets and affects normal host physiology and cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) progression allows using these findings as a potential basis for therapeutic intervention. Identification of bioactive microbial‐derived molecules potentially affecting human metabolism can be developed as a bona fide “postbiotic therapy,” bypassing the high interindividual variability of the microbiomes producing such molecules. One such example is SCFAs, which in rodents demonstrated beneficial effects on adipose tissue browning and energy expenditure, 118 secretion of GLP‐1 from L cells and glycemic control, 135 and cardiac functions. 172 Secondary bile acids are another example of bacterial molecules that showed beneficial cardiometabolic effects in mice, as exemplified by secondary bile acids that attenuated hypertension 69 and show protection against diabetic retinopathy 85 and cognitive impairments.",611f6a53-c47d-4922-a4e0-044aa569ad12

An addition of the secondary bile acid TUDCA or an agonist of the bile acids receptor TGR5 led to protection from cognitive decline and retinopathy in diabetic mice, bypassing the need for IF diet, 85 , 86 whereas microbial enzyme inhibitors for trimethylamine‐N‐oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) 169 , 199 may alleviate cardiometabolic derangements.
