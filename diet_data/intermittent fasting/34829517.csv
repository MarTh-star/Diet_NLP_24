0,methods0," Thirty-two male rats were randomly divided into three groups: Normal group, administered a standard diet; metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) group, administered a 60% high-fat diet; time-restricted feeding (time restricted feeding (TRF)) group, administered a 60% high-fat diet. Eating was allowed for 6 h per day (16:00–22:00). After 15 weeks, liver lipidomics and other indicators were compared.   Animals and study protocol  Thirty-two specific-pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with a body weight of 185–245 g were purchased and raised in the Animal Center of Xi'an Jiaotong University [SYXK (Shaanxi) 2020-005]. After 1 week of adaptive feeding, 10 rats were randomly selected in the Normal group (262.4 ± 12.5 g) using the random number table method and fed a normal diet (10 kcal% fat); 12 rats were assigned to the metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) group (263.9 ± 20.",a0f4126e-cecf-422e-b24a-d9e370f7bcde

No significant difference in baseline body weight between the three groups was observed (P = 0.958). The high-fat diet was purchased from Changzhou SYSE BIO (China); the carbohydrate, protein, and fat energy accounted for 20, 20, and 60%, respectively. All rats had access to water ad libitum and were exposed to a 12:12 day:night cycle at a constant temperature of ~22°C. During the 15-week experimental period, food intake was measured daily, while general conditions such as skin color, hair, and animal behavior were observed. The rats were weighed every week.  This study was approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University (2021-763).",065b756a-90c0-486c-ac63-ffc41e2a6b7d
2,methods2,"  Biochemical parameters  At the end of week 15 and after overnight fasting for 12 h, the rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 1% pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg). Approximately 4 mL of blood was collected from the heart, incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 10 min to separate the serum. Fasting blood glucose (Fasting blood glucose (FBG)), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density cholesterol (LDL), alanine aminotransferase (aminotransferase (ALT)), aspartate aminotransferase (aminotransferase (AST)), and uric acid (UA) were measured using an automatic biochemical analyzer (AU5811, Beckman Coulter, CA, used ABI StepOne Plus (USA)).

4,methods4,"  Liver lipidomics  Using ultraperformance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) with Metware Database and multiple reaction monitoring (multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)), the lipid metabolites in all samples were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed. Quality control (QC) samples were prepared from a mixture of sample extracts. During instrumental analysis, one QC sample for every 10 test samples was inserted to ensure the repeatability of the analysis process. The total ion chromatograms (TICs) of different QC samples were overlapped and analyzed (13–15).  Principal component analysis (Principal component analysis (PCA)) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were combined to identify differential metabolites.

In the first 4 weeks of the study, the average daily food intake of both the metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) groups decreased, possibly due to rats not fully adapting to the high-fat diet, and subsequently increased on weeks 5–6 and remained relatively stable thereafter (Figure 2B).",7eda9776-2461-4913-8307-139c569a59f1

23,discussion0," In this study, rats adapted to the 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) mode on day 2, and after 15 weeks of 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF), the average daily food intake for this group was reduced by 13%, while the body weight, body fat ratio, and liver fat content were lower than those of the metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) group. Hundreds of liver lipidomics also improved. Weight loss of 3%–5% within 1 year can improve metabolic syndrome and reverse simple hepatic steatosis, whereas a 7%–10% decrease in body mass can significantly reduce serum amino acid transferase levels and improve non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (6); our results suggest that a 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) can improve metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD).  Unhealthy lifestyles, such as excessive eating and lack of exercise, increase the risk of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) (17).",633a33d1-b5af-41e1-ab40-e7a717e64224
24,discussion1," When the body takes in more calories than it burns, the excess calories are stored as fats. Additionally, dietary structure can promote the occurrence of metabolic diseases, such as metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Excessive intake of fat, cholesterol, and fructose can promote the occurrence of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD); fructose consumption also increases the survival rate of intestinal epithelial cells, which in turn increases the length of intestinal villi, thereby allowing them to absorb more nutrients (18).  Calorie restriction (CR) limits the total number of calories and requires no eating schedule; conversely, IF places more emphasis on restricting the eating schedule, usually for more than 12 h, during which the body will undergo a metabolic switch to burn fat (19) and restore the body's internal clock, which can lead to weight loss and improve metabolic disorders (20–25).",84ff90ec-a4f6-45f0-b85e-328fced100a7
25,discussion2," Circadian clocks and feeding times regulate the oscillations and levels of hepatic TG (26). Studies have shown that time restricted feeding (TRF) resets the circadian clock in the liver and enhances the transcription of key metabolic regulators of sugar and lipid homeostasis, while dawn-to-sunset fasting is a potentially cost-effective intervention for obesity, metabolic syndrome, and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (27, 28). time restricted feeding (TRF) can reduce the adverse effects of a high-fat diet by regulating the circadian rhythms of liver lipid metabolism and gut microbiota (29). Indeed, early time restricted feeding (TRF) improves insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, and oxidative stress in men with prediabetes, even without weight loss (30).  The fasting duration of alternate-day fasting is 24 h, which may not be suitable for those with modern lifestyles. Alternatively, if the fasting duration is too short, the effect will be compromised.",f67c57ba-467e-4df0-b8f0-02a209350e13
26,discussion3," The 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) has little effect on work and life, and is similar to the long-standing dictum in China, “no food after noon”, which is conducive to long-term adherence (31).  The results of this study show that compared with the metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) group, the 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) group had significantly higher PPARα mRNA expression in the liver tissue (P < 0.01). PPARs control various intracellular metabolic processes and contain three subtypes (32), of which PPARα, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is the primary regulator of liver β-oxidation and microsomal ω-oxidation. Moreover, PPARα is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. Using carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 as a key enzyme, fatty acids can pass through the mitochondrial inner membrane to the mitochondrial matrix where they are metabolized.",8593b596-cb4e-4428-b2d5-398bf8cc9573
27,discussion4," The activation of PPARα can reduce the production of TG and fat in the liver and improve metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) (33, 34).  Moreover, our results showed that the expression levels of SREBP-1c and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in liver tissues were significantly higher in the metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) group than in the Normal group (P < 0.01), whereas the expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA were lower in the 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) group than those in the metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) group (P < 0.05). The fatty acid synthase (FAS) system is a key multi-enzyme complex in fat synthesis. The downregulation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) reduces fat synthesis, thus preventing or treating metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) (35, 36).",51ad6f64-e78f-498b-b019-4430c8170533
28,discussion5," SREBP-1c plays a major role in the control of lipid production by controlling the expression of several adipogenesis-related genes, and regulates lipid metabolism by promoting lipid synthesis by the liver and inhibiting its transport, while the downregulation of SREBP-1c expression restores the balance of liver lipid metabolism to normal (37, 38).  Exercise and hunger can promote PPARα (39), and changes in lipid metabolic pathways during fasting have been reported (9, 19). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of differential metabolites showed that the pathways involved mainly included glycerolipid metabolism, metabolic pathways, fat digestion and absorption, regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, lipid, and atherosclerosis. Therefore, we compared the expression of fatty acid metabolism genes to determine the mechanism of 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) in the treatment of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD).",f3e0e70a-4fa7-4821-a120-9bacfb934e9c
29,discussion6," The results showed that, compared with the metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) group, the expression of PPARα in the 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) group was significantly increased, and that of the lipid synthesis gene fatty acid synthase (FAS) was decreased. Furthermore, by recording the daily food intake, which has not been performed prior to this study, we found that 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) reduced the daily food intake of rats (16.6 ± 1.6 > 14.4 ± 0.9 g, P < 0.001) compared with that of the rats that freely consumed a high-fat diet. This is another significant reason for the decrease in body weight, body fat ratio, and liver fat content in the 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) group, which is a novel finding of this study (40–42).  The 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) could reduce the trend of aminotransferase (AST), TC, LDL, and UA levels increased with the high-fat diet, however, the difference was not significant.",204d9721-94f5-4142-8dcb-54cdd87475fd
30,discussion7," The results also showed that 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) could increase serum TG level, although not significantly. This suggests that 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) has no significant effect on the serological indices of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) rats.  Nevertheless, our findings support the hypothesis that 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) can improve metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD); 6 h time restricted feeding (TRF) can not only control the total caloric intake but also reshape metabolic rhythms and regulate the biological clock by restricting eating time. These results provide novel insights pertaining to the prevention and treatment strategies against metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD).
