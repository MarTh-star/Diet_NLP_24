0,introduction0,"Optimal feeding regimens for both veterinary and human hospitalized patients have not yet been established. Underfeeding is common during hospitalization and is associated with depressed immunity, increased readmission rates, and increased mortality (1–4). However, overfeeding critically ill patients has also been shown to have deleterious effects (5–7). In particular, iatrogenic hyperglycemia can lead to impaired wound healing, neuronal dysfunction, increased production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), inhibition of leukocyte function, vasculitis, and ultimately a poorer clinical outcome (8–13). Some of these effects can be abrogated when blood glucose is normalized (9, 14). So whereas clinicians want to provide appropriate nutrition for hospital patients, they need to establish the best means of doing so, while avoiding hyperglycemia.  A potentially effective feeding regime to achieve these agnostic goals is intermittent fasting.",16a87a23-1ff0-410f-acd0-2317fd450454
1,introduction1," Intermittent fasting is the process of reducing meal frequency in order to prolong the period of fasting between meals, but without necessarily restricting total caloric intake when expressed over a longer period of time. Extending the period of fasting between meals has been found to increase insulin sensitivity, reduce serum fructosamine, reduce cancer cell proliferation, reduce concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in circulation, delay aging, and improve neuronal repair following injury when compared to continuous feeding (15–25). In healthy mice, blood glucose and insulin concentrations were reduced following a period of intermittent fasting (21). Several mechanisms have been proposed including the reduction of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species, activation of sirtuins and associated promotion of autophagy and cell cleansing, and decreased expression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, an upstream mediator of apoptosis (18, 26–28).",1bb31640-7547-48d9-99fb-10654eb387f8
2,introduction2," These potential mechanisms would allow a reduction in oxidative stress and a more tailored repair response following injury.  An intermittent fasting regime is of particular interest in patients with spinal disease, as it has been shown to reduce lesion size and improve recovery in rodent models of spinal injury compared with daily feeding (21–23). Ketones, which increase during the fasting period, upregulate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+-dependent sirtuin 3 and superoxide dismutase, increases the expression of autophagy-promoting protein forkhead box O3a, and reduces neuronal injury in the cerebral cortex of rats following experimentally induced hypoglycemia (29, 30). In addition, ghrelin, an orexigenic peptide secreted by the stomach in a fasted state, protects neurons from ischemia and reperfusion injury in vivo, and decreases the expression of the TNF-α and IL-1β from microglial cells in Parkinson-modeled mesencephalic neuronal cell cultures (31, 32).",83852073-11e8-4849-bf38-825d7f8f70e2
3,introduction3," Thus, intermittent fasting may be a feeding strategy that promotes neuronal recovery while also avoiding hyperglycemia.  Although there are many potential benefits to intermittent fasting, there are possible detrimental consequences as well. Humoral and cellular immune functions are known to decrease in a fasted state, which is in part the result of a drop in the plasma adipokine, leptin (33, 34). Leptin increases neutrophil chemotaxis and macrophage phagocytosis, and affects the maturation of T-cells (35). Short-term fasting in several species reduces T-cell mediated responses, and splenic and peripheral immune cell numbers (17, 36, 37). Injection of leptin into fasted or leptin-deficient ob/ob mice reverses the suppression of lymphocyte differentiation, macrophage phagocytosis, and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses caused by leptin deficiency (34, 38, 39).",e651fccf-641d-4ddc-a843-73b6178953a1
4,introduction4," However, rats consuming a high fat diet attenuates the drop in leptin during fasting, and increases ketone production between meals (40, 41). In addition, feeding medium-chain triglycerides (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s) promotes the formation of ketones in the fed state (42, 43). After eating, the majority of medium-chain fatty acids are absorbed through the portal circulation and are metabolized by hepatocytes into ketones (44, 45). So feeding a high fat diet enriched with medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s may have the dual benefit of maintaining leptin serum concentration while also promoting ketogenesis during the short periods of fasting. Therefore, intermittent fasting on a high fat diet enriched with medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s may be preferential.  The principal aim of this study was to determine the metabolic and immunological effects of a 48 h intermittent fasting regime in healthy dogs.",53b38c5e-e286-45a8-b18d-a4241fdbdb58
5,introduction5," Our primary hypothesis was that dogs undergoing intermittent fasting would have higher plasma concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate and ghrelin, and lower concentrations of glucose, insulin, and leptin compared with dogs fed daily. Our secondary hypothesis was that dogs undergoing an intermittent fasting regime on a high fat diet enriched with medium-chain triglycerides would have a greater blood β-hydroxybutyrate and leptin concentrations compared with dogs intermittently fasted on a low fat diet.

6,methods0,"Animals Following a complete physical examination, 10 healthy, adult dogs from Massey University's Canine Nutrition Unit were used in this study. The dogs were of two breeds: Harrier Hounds (n = 7) and New Zealand Huntaways (n = 3), and were composed of four neutered males and six speyed females. The dogs had a mean age of 7.1 (SD 2.1) years, mean body weight of 27.8 (SD 3.1) kilograms, and a mean body condition score (body condition score (BCS)) of 4.2 (SD 0.4). The study protocol was approved by the Massey University Animal Ethics Committee (MUAEC #16/130).  Study Design A week before the commencement of the study, all dogs were transitioned onto a high carbohydrate, low fat commercial dry diet to allow for acclimation. The dogs were fed to meet their maintenance energy requirement based on historical colony data.",0a467255-5cbb-4a0c-8f1b-0182d20ccc53
7,methods1," After this acclimation period, the dogs were randomized into one of three groups which underwent each feeding trial regime in a 3 × 3 Latin-square design with a weeklong “wash out” duration in-between. The three feeding regimes were as follows: (1) daily fed feeding on a low fat (LF), high carbohydrate diet (BID), (2) intermittent fasting (feeding once every 48 h) on the same LF diet (IF LF), and (3) intermittent fasting (feeding once every 48 h) on a high fat (HF) diet (IF HF). Both diets used in this study were formulated to meet the nutrient requirements for adult dogs defined by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO)). A commercial dry food1 was chosen as the low-fat, high carbohydrate diet. The high fat diet was created using the same dry commercial diet with the addition of powdered whey protein, beef tallow, sunflower oil, coconut oil and a multivitamin/mineral mix2 to ensure adequacy of the total diet.",ec6573b3-9a3c-4b07-9e11-b6d767ac9d6d

When the dogs were in the intermittent fasting regime, they were offered twice their maintenance energy requirement in the morning every other day. The dogs were allowed up to 3 h to consume their meal, after which the food was removed and weighed. During the wash out period between feeding regimes, all dogs were placed on the commercial high carbohydrate, low fat dry diet and fed twice a day for 1 week.  On days 1, 3, 5, and 7 of a trial period, a fasted blood sample (12 mL in total) was collected into lithium heparin and plain red-top vacutainers3 from all dogs by jugular venipuncture before food was offered.",7b497e9f-9486-4516-bdae-b013f975bc19
9,methods5," Day 1 represented an overnight-fasted, baseline sample, while the samples collected on days 3, 5, and 7 represented either a 12 h fast when the dogs were eating daily, or a 48 h fast when the dogs were fasted intermittently. Immediately following blood collection, a protease inhibitor4 was added to the sample in the plain red-top vacutainer to prevent ghrelin degradation. All samples were placed on ice until they were centrifuged, and serum and plasma removed. Daily food intake, weekly body weight and body condition score were recorded for all dogs. To compare the caloric intake of the dogs on the different feeding regimes, the total calories eaten every 2 days (i.e., days 1 and 2, days 3 and 4, days 5 and 6) was divided by the weekly starting weight of each dog to the power of 0.75 in order to express intake as kcal per 48 h/kgBWT0.75. In addition, day (5 am to 8 pm) and night (8 pm to 5 am) activity of the dogs was measured using a tri-axial accelerometer5 fitted to their collar.",c6d08d07-a2da-4acc-b666-440607a9c31a
10,methods6,"  After blood sampling on day 7, all dogs were placed onto the “wash out” feeding regime. Following a wash out, each group was fed according to their next assigned feeding regime, and blood samples taken as described above. This was repeated again once more so that all groups underwent each of the three different feeding regimes with a washout period in between.  β-Hydroxybutyrate, Glucose, and Metabolomics Within 1 h of collection, plasma was harvested from the heparin vacutainers following centrifugation for 10 min at 3,000 rcf at 4°C. Plasma glucose was analyzed using a handheld glucometer6 which has been previously validated for use in dogs (47).

17,methods13,"  Sample Size An a priori power analysis was performed using a desired mean difference and previously published standard deviations for key metabolites and hormones. The mean difference and standard deviation (SD) used in the power analysis were: β-hydroxybutyrate 0.05 (SD 0.01 mmol/L), ghrelin 75 (SD 53 pg/mL), leptin 3,000 (SD 3,000 pg/mL), and insulin 220 (SD 150 pg/mL). This indicated that a sample size of 10 dogs would be necessary for significance level (α) of 0.5 and a power of 80% to detect a difference in β-hydroxybutyrate, ghrelin, leptin, and insulin.  Statistical Analysis Metabolomics For analysis, the Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were divided into 0.04 ppm spectral buckets, where the regions corresponding to water and DSS (4.68 to 4.88, −0.1 to 0.1 ppm, respectively) were excluded, along with the following additional regions 5.51 to 5.84, 5.92 to 6.07, and 6.11 to 6.31.

We found that dogs fasted for 48 h on a HF diet enriched in medium-chain triglycerides promoted higher blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, and lower insulin concentrations than when they were fed daily or fasted on a LF diet.",43995ede-914b-4cff-b1ac-67a26f0d35f2
32,discussion1," Leptin was not maintained during intermittent fasting by using a HF diet; however, there was no difference in the immune parameters studied between when the dogs were fed the HF diet and when they were daily fed. Fasted ghrelin concentrations were lowest when the dogs were intermittently fasted on a HF diet. Overall, these findings indicate that an intermittent fasting regime on a high fat diet enriched in medium-chain triglycerides increases plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations without causing immune suppression, however it did not abrogate the drop in leptin or increase ghrelin concentrations during fasting.  A commercially available LF kibble was chosen in this study as the control diet. When dogs were eating the LF diet intermittently, they consumed fewer calories and lost more weight compared to when they were eating the HF diet. There are numerous studies in several species which also show this phenomenon (56).",da93c3df-ea36-4ebd-a244-55b0b9c0d591
33,discussion2," In one study, dogs fed ad libitum a high fat diet (51% energy from fat) gained more weight than dogs fed ad libitum on a low fat diet (23% energy from fat) (57). Therefore, to prevent weight loss in an intermittent fasting regime, it is likely that a high fat, energy dense food is required to ensure that a dog will consume its full requirements. However, there are epidemiological associations between high dietary fat consumption and pancreatitis in dogs (58). In early experimental models, dogs fed a high fat vs. a high protein/high carbohydrate diet led to more severe clinical signs and pathological changes in the pancreas (59, 60). However, the diets were unlikely to have been complete and balanced rations, and so other nutrient deficiencies may have confounded the results. Giving table scraps and consuming food discarded in the trash have also been identified as risk factors for the development of pancreatitis in dogs (61).",9151322b-0078-4971-8d57-69c91a6bc6c2
34,discussion3," However, it is difficult to speculate what the fat contents of those items were. In contrast, feeding diets with varying fat contents, including medium-chain triglycerides, to a group of healthy dogs did not have an effect on serum canine trypsin-like immunoreactivity (cTLI), pancreatic-lipase immunoactivity (cPLI), or gastrin concentrations (62). However, the highest fat diet in this study contained only ~40% fat on an energy basis. Still, there are numerous studies and reports of sled dog diets where the dogs were fed a diet with a similar fat content to our HF diet without causing pancreatitis (63–68).  Ketones provide an alternative source of energy for neurons and have been shown to reduce neuronal degeneration and improve recovery in rodent models of brain and spinal injury (30, 69–71). While β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were highest in the dogs when they were intermittently fasted on the HF diet, the concentrations obtained (mean 0.061, SD 0.",67f856ca-4aa3-44f3-a7b8-5955675ada01
35,discussion4,"024 mmol/L) were much lower compared to rodents (0.8–2 mmol/L) and humans (1.67 mmol/L) fasted for a similar amount of time (22, 72, 73). Our finding is consistent with other published studies where the dog does not reach the same blood concentration of ketones as other species after comparable fasts (74–76). However, it has been shown that the rate of total ketone production is similar between dogs and men following a 48 h fast (77, 78). Further, De Bruijne and Van den Brom (74) established that dogs have a higher rate of clearance of plasma ketones than man. Thus, the seemingly low concentration of β-hydroxybutyrate in dogs is not from reduced production of ketones, but rather from higher rates of peripheral utilization compared with rodents and humans. In addition, although a single blood sample is indicative of the concentration of a metabolite at that moment, it does not describe its flux (production and utilization) (78).",eabf8473-100a-4959-bb11-2493f79d6f13
36,discussion5," The concentration of β-hydroxybutyrate in the brain and cerebral spinal fluid (cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)) is proportional to the concentration found in plasma, and increases as the duration of fasting continues (72, 79, 80). When available, β-hydroxybutyrate is preferentially utilized over glucose, lactate and pyruvate by neurons as an energy substrate (81). So even a small increase in plasma concentrations of ketones could still provide a large contribution of energy for the brain and neurons.  In our study, all dogs had fasting blood glucose concentrations within the normal reference range, however lower values were obtained when the dogs were fasted for 48 h vs. 12 h. This reflects the difference in the length of fasting rather than the macronutrient composition of the diets. Similarly in a study of dogs eating either a carbohydrate-free or high carbohydrate diet, the blood glucose concentrations were the same after a 24 h fast in both groups of dogs (82).",b5f57b70-8373-4673-b21a-be871282e63e
37,discussion6," The lowest concentrations of insulin were seen when the dogs were intermittently fasted on the HF diet, which indicated a decrease in insulin production and/or increase in insulin sensitivity. The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) insulin resistance scores were also lowest when the dogs were on this feeding regime, which is a reflection of both low fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. Both caloric restriction and a reduction in fat mass improves insulin sensitivity in overweight dogs (83–86). In our study, intermittently fasted dogs eating a HF diet lost less weight than when intermittently fasted on a LF diet, and yet had lower insulin concentrations. Therefore, it appears that intermittent fasting on a high fat diet may reduce insulin production or improve insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss.  Alanine and lactate were two gluconeogenic metabolites identified by OPLS as being different between the feeding regimes.",ff6c7f76-f07d-4bb5-b395-8850f3b8bc1f
38,discussion7," During the early stage of fasting, proteolysis of muscle releases alanine for gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes (87, 88). In a study of dogs eating a carbohydrate-free diet, the turnover rate of alanine and its conversion of alanine to plasma glucose were increased after a 48 h fast (89). Lactate is transported by the same monocarboxylate transporters (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s) as ketones, and also serve as an energy source for cells, including neurons, in a fasted state (90, 91). Feeding a high fat diet to rats increased the expression of medium chain triglyceride (MCT)1 by brain endothelial cells (92). Also, lactate concentrations are increased in the brain of humans fasted for 2 days (72). Thus, the reduction of both alanine and lactate in the dogs when intermittently fasted on a HF diet may be due to an increase in uptake by the liver, brain, and kidneys.",7e788479-2f58-47da-9550-d7a83c81486d
39,discussion8,"  The adipokine, leptin, has many roles in the body including the activation of phagocytosis by monocytes and chemotaxis of neutrophils and oxidative radical generation (93–95). In our study, we found that leptin concentrations were lowest in the intermittently fasted dogs regardless of the fat content of the diet. Both fasting and a reduction in fat mass are known to decrease leptin production (96, 97). During the course of our study, the dogs lost some weight; however, there was no difference in the starting concentrations of leptin at the beginning of each study week in any of the dogs. Therefore, the reduction in leptin concentrations was the result of the fasting regime, and not fat mass loss. In addition, although leptin was not maintained during fasting by feeding a HF diet, there was no difference between the immune parameters studied in those dogs and when the dogs were fed daily.",da5d4658-ad66-4aab-82b2-ed273106271f
40,discussion9," We did find a reduction in the percentage of leucocytes undergoing phagocytosis and respiratory burst when the dogs were intermittently fasted on a LF diet. This suggests that the immune changes were not leptin-mediated. The suppressive effect however was not consistent throughout all the immune parameters studied, and the clinical significance of this reduction is not known.  Limitations Both diets used in this study were formulated to meet Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) requirements, and while all attempts were made to create similar nutrient profiles excluding the fat and carbohydrate content, the diets did differ from one another in some micronutrients. In addition, when the dogs were intermittently fasted on the LF diet, they lost more weight than in the other feeding regimes, indicating the dogs were in a greater catabolic state.",54e5f9d5-931e-49b5-9138-a9ad5af8df18
41,discussion10," However, an increase in proteolysis and fatty acid oxidation was not reflected by an increase in the plasma alanine and ketone concentrations of the dogs during the LF diet intermittent fasting regime. In addition, plasma ketone concentration was not associated with weight loss in this study. A washout week using the control feeding regime was performed in between each study period, and none of the outcome parameters were significantly different in the dogs at the start of each study period. Furthermore, diet order was examined in the multivariate model which did not show an effect. Our results suggest that the differences in diet profiles and greater weight loss during the LF diet intermittent fasting regime likely had a minimal effect, however, a more thorough study would be required to determine if that is indeed the case.  In our study, no ill effects were seen when the dogs were intermittently fasted on the high fat diet.",7e04668b-f174-43c2-b061-f37ce6b06f22
42,discussion11," Acute feeding of a high fat diet in other species can lead to an increase in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis-α, but this has not been shown consistently (98). Interestingly, an intermittent fasting regime has been shown to ameliorate the expression of proinflammation-related genes in hepatocytes during long-term high-fat feeding in mice (99). The effects of intermittent fasting on markers of inflammation during high fat feeding in dogs is not currently known. We did not measure inflammatory cytokines in our study, however future studies may wish to do so. Furthermore, a difference in immunity between the feeding regimes was apparent only when the dogs were intermittently fasted on the LF diet. The significance of this immune effect is not known, but there may be a greater implication of this in a clinical setting.  To promote ketone formation, coconut oil was used in the HF diet as a rich source of medium-chain triglycerides.",dde5d3eb-d904-421f-acf5-cfaa756dc01c
43,discussion12," However, the main medium-chain triglyceride constituent in coconut oil is dodecanoic acid (lauric acid, C12), with decanoic acid (capric acid, C10) and octanoic acid (caprylic acid, C8) as the great remainder (100). When given in equal amounts, intake of decanoic acid and octanoic acid leads to a greater ketone production postprandially then dodecanoic acid (101, 102). Thus, to increase the effect of medium-chain triglycerides on ketogenesis, a concentrated oil with a higher quantity of decanoic and octanoic acid can be given instead of coconut oil.  The homeostasis model assessment (homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)) was developed to provide a measure of peripheral insulin resistance from fasting glucose and insulin. The scores correlate well with a euglycemic clamp model in humans, and has been used to detect improvements in insulin sensitivity with weight loss and fasting in humans (103–105).",1f421633-001f-4185-a5e8-066045ddb706
44,discussion13," In our study, dogs intermittently fasted on a HF diet had the lowest homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) score compared to when they were fed daily or intermittently fasted on the LF diet. However, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) has been found to be variably reliable in companion animals in detecting insulin resistance (106–108). So while we found a difference with homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) scores in the different feeding regimes, any interpretation in peripheral insulin sensitivity should be confirmed using a euglycemic clamp.  Conclusion In this study, we found that fasting for up to 48 h in healthy dogs does not cause immunosuppression, and that fasting on a high fat diet enriched with medium-chain triglycerides promoted a greater plasma ketone concentration than when the dogs were fasted after eating a low fat diet. However, the concentrations obtained in dogs are significantly less than what is reported in other species fasted for a similar period of time.",63795d82-7d20-44f3-9a0f-61fe63a6355d
45,discussion14," Therefore, a ketone kinetics study is required to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the flux of ketones in dogs while fasting for varying durations, and whether this feeding regime could be feasible in hospitalized dogs recovering from neuronal injury. In addition, dogs intermittently fasted on a low fat diet consumed fewer calories and lost more weight than when fed the high fat diet. Therefore, any practical application of this type of feeding regime would require modification of the diet itself (e.g., increase the energy density of the diet to reduce the volume and gut fill) and/or reducing the number of days or length of fasting. Ultimately, while we showed the possibility of this type of feeding regime to be feasible and to produce ketones without ill effect in healthy dogs, its application in hospitalized dogs remains to be determined.
