Animals  Seventy-five 8-week-old female C57BL6 mice were assigned into three groups: 25 AL fed control, 25 CR (10% less than AL), and 25 IF (every-other-day feeding, totaling in a 10% weekly reduction in calorie consumption). The mice were subjected to these regimens for 3 months, after which three per group were used for gene expression studies to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) (Supplementary Fig. 1). The remaining mice were used for behavioral studies (Morris water maze (mice were used for behavioral studies (Morris water maze (MWM)); n = 5 AL, 10 CR, and 10 IF) and were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for histology (n = 12/group). Half of the BrdU-injected mice were sacrificed 24 h after the last injection; the remaining mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after the last BrdU injection (Supplementary Fig. 1).",93f6c61d-5ec8-4496-947b-d8a7e86a2798

3,methods3,"  Immunostaining of free-floating sections and immunofluorescence  For each diet group or Kl brain, one-in-six series of sections were transferred into one well of a six-well plate. Staining procedures followed those previously described [34]. Analysis of the septo-temporal distribution of doublecortin+ (DCX) as well as in kl/kl and Wt brains (DCX)+) cells in the DG of diet mice, as well as a dendrite quantitative morphometric analysis, was also undertaken, following the immunostaining of sections for DCX) as well as in kl/kl and Wt brains (DCX) (Supplementary Fig. 2A, B). Additional details can be found in the Supplementary information (Supplementary Table 1).  Threshold analysis of KL  Genome-wide expression analysis was used to investigate genes upregulated by IF.

Procedures for both stereology and confocal microscopy followed those previously described [34]. The criteria used to differentiate the DH and ventral hippocampus (VH) followed those described previously [36]. Specifically, brain slices within −1.06 to −2.06 mm relative to bregma were used for the DH, and those containing coordinates −3.08 to −3.80 mm were used for the VH, in accordance with the Paxinos and Franklin’s brain atlas [37].",6ccf3032-a62a-4e3c-9ec3-ddbbd523c1b8

After 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the media was changed and 48 h later the cells were subjected to antibiotic selection using 0.2 μl/ml Puromycin. The Kl secreted pVLX-Tight-Puro expresses resistance to the antibiotic Puromycin. To ensure only successfully transducted cells were cultured, the cells were further subjected to Puromycin for 2 days. Cells not carrying the plasmid were dead after 2 days. The pLVX-Tet-On Advanced plasmid expresses resistance to the antibiotic Neomycin; however, the HPCOA07/03 cells are already resistant to Neomycin after they have been made conditionally immortalized with the c-myc-ER.

29,results16,"  Kl is required in vivo at different stages of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in a region-specific manner  To further investigate the hypothesis that Kl is required for appropriate adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), the expression of different markers of the neurogenic process was assessed in brain sections from Kl mutant mice (kl/kl) [27]. In concordance with the in vitro data, the number of proliferative Ki67+ cells was not altered in either the DH or VH of Kl knockout mice (kl/kl) (Supplementary Fig. 9). Generation of neuroblasts, however, appears to be strongly dependent on Kl, as shown by the decreased number of DCX) as well as in kl/kl and Wt brains (DCX)+ cells in the kl/kl group (Fig. 5A) and reflects the in vitro observations following downregulation of Kl.

30,results18," Previous reports have proposed that the dorsal axis of the hippocampus is linked to cognitive processing, whereas the ventral axis is related to stress, emotion, and affect. Our results demonstrate that Kl is required for adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in the DH, suggesting a potential mechanism through which IF improves long-term retention memory.Fig. 5 Klotho is required for adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in the dorsal hippocampus.

32,discussion0," This study addressed whether the beneficial effects of IF on cognition are due to a decrease in total amount of calories consumed or to the increased interval between meals. We demonstrate that, with an overall 10% matched-energy intake, IF in the form of every-other-day feeding is superior to daily CR in enhancing long-term memory performance in mice, and we provide evidence that this enhancement is associated with increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and expression of the longevity gene Kl. Previous studies have already implicated Kl in the regulation of the hippocampal neurogenic process to different extent depending on the age of the mice [32, 33]. Here, we confirm some of these findings in 8-week-old Kl-deficient mice and demonstrate that Kl regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in a region-specific manner in the dorsal axis of the hippocampus.",2fe7b37a-19dc-4e11-a677-97dbd7b14aaa
33,discussion1,"  IF has previously been demonstrated to enhance learning and consolidation processes [8] and to partly reverse age-associated impairment in motor coordination and memory function in rodents [10]. Similarly, 30–40% CR has been shown to improve learning and memory performance [48], including in a number of different contexts such as aging [7, 49, 50], Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [51], and gastric bypass surgery [52]. To our knowledge, the only previous study comparing the efficacy of IF vs. CR on cognitive performance utilized a transgenic mouse model of AD and revealed that both interventions enhanced locomotion and exploratory behavior and ameliorated age-related memory deficits [20]. IF, but not CR, however, improved cognitive performance without reducing levels of Alzheimer’s pathology, suggesting that IF promotes resilience to pathology and neuronal injury [18, 20].",b1b18730-7a30-44b1-bb53-ceaea894333c
34,discussion2," Notably, many of these reports used 40% CR, whereas in the present study we opted for 10% CR to match the reduced calorie intake in the IF group. The failure of 10% CR to improve memory performance may therefore reflect an insufficient reduction in calorie intake. Ten percent reductions in calorie intake, however, whether achieved by continuous or intermittent reductions, are more likely to be suitable for human compliance [23]. As such, our results indicate the potential of IF over 10% CR to bring about improved cognition. It is worth noting, though, that studies in humans are warranted to determine the most feasible forms of IF that could render improved cognitive performance in this population. This is of particular relevance considering that adherence to the form of IF adopted in the present study might be challenging to promote in human populations.",fde7fb70-33ad-4309-9e37-18d67dcb46bd
35,discussion3," Evaluating the effects of other fasting paradigms, such as adopting longer periods of AL intake between fasting days or time-restricted feeding paradigms, should give us valuable answers as to how to promote realistic adherence to fasting without compromising its positive effects on markers of neuroplasticity [3]. Moreover, in alignment with more traditional regimens utilized in the field, future studies should investigate the effects of 30–40% CR paradigms on cognitive performance and the markers of neuroplasticity investigated here. This will further clarify the potential of daily CR in evoking optimal IF-like effects and the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with these.  We also demonstrate that both IF and CR increased proliferation and survival of newly born neurons in the hippocampus.",8caee356-9852-4d86-bda8-6c59ca1b74da
36,discussion4," Interestingly, an increase in proliferation is not observed in IF paradigms inducing a 30% energy restriction [16, 53], whereas we show for the first time that this effect can occur with a reduction of just 10% calories. Conversely, an extreme 60% CR regimen has been shown to increase neuronal apoptosis and be detrimental to cognition, as measured by levels of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins in the hippocampus and performance in the eight-arm maze, respectively [54]. Therefore, 10% CR may represent an optimal, much less severe value in which increased cell proliferation and survival occurs in the DG, even though not as optimal to adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) as an IF paradigm. While both long-term CR and IF regimens have been associated with improved cognitive functions, lifelong 40% CR has also been linked with increased anxiety in female C57BL/6 mice as measured in the open field and elevated plus-maze tests [50].",167ba1d2-8635-41bd-ad6f-0582a31fb06e
37,discussion5," A 12-week regimen consisting of either 10% CR or IF could thus be potentially adapted to the clinical setting for the prevention of neuropsychiatric diseases that involve reduced levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), such as depression [55–58], anxiety [59], and AD [60], overcoming the negative impact on mood of prolonged periods of CR [50].  Our data reveal that only IF animals displayed an increased number of neuroblasts in the DG. These immature cells are known to exhibit different physiological characteristics than those of more mature dentate granule cells, including higher excitability and plasticity [61, 62]. Immature neurons are also thought to contribute to improved retention memory; for example, after 2–8 weeks following acquisition, one report showed a positive correlation between an increased number of neuroblasts in the DG and successful recall in mice [44].",ccb0f653-e957-42e0-ad75-c240f574e9a0
38,discussion6," Conversely, long-term memory retention was found to be impaired in mice with reduced populations of immature dentate granule cells [43]. It is possible that the increase in neuroblasts following IF, but not CR, results in a greater number of immature neurons that contribute to improved long-term retention memory. In addition, it is important to remember that a key adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN)-dependent function is pattern separation and therefore, for performance in the mice were used for behavioral studies (Morris water maze (MWM) to be indicative of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) levels the protocols used must be sensitive enough to test the rodent’s ability to discriminate contexts that are both spatially complex and highly similar [63].",9ece0f0a-d972-45c0-a2e5-6c736b16a8a9
39,discussion7," For this, elements such as the inclusion of another acquisition task where the hidden platform has changed places and counting the number of crossings in the expected quadrant as the main read-out of the probe trial phase should be present in the mice were used for behavioral studies (Morris water maze (MWM) protocol. These elements were not used in our study and this could have hidden the detection of potential positive effects of IF on learning and short-term retention memory. Another question that remains to be answered is on whether the observed enhancing effects of IF on the number of neuroblasts is mediated by increased activity. It is well established that physical exercise increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) [34, 64], both through an increase in the number of postmitotic neuroblasts and mature neurons [65]. Besides, evidence from rodent studies using time-restricted feeding protocols demonstrated an increase in locomotor activity [66, 67].",14ea5373-5269-4eb8-92cd-b35ac20c9d21
40,discussion8," It is therefore plausible to hypothesize that IF could elicit an increase in locomotor activity which, in turn, could both induce an increase in the number of neuroblasts, and their survival into functional mature neurons in the DG. Moreover, gene ontology and pathway analysis of genes differentially expressed in the hippocampi of IF and CR mice revealed marked enrichment for the terms “synapse” and “cognition” as well as involvement of Erk1/2 signaling cascades. These data reveal a transcriptional profile for IF that is indicative of enhanced synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, many of the early studies reporting the benefits of dietary restriction on brain plasticity also showed an upregulation of BDNF and other neurotrophic factors [16].",1351cc51-5c23-4f1c-8641-46073a5873ef
41,discussion9," Importantly, several of these studies employed IF to cause 30–40% reductions in calorie intake; these data and the results herein suggest that increased synaptic plasticity may reflect a key response to IF that also contributes to improved cognition [68, 69]. Interestingly, our microarray analysis also revealed that two genes—namely, Ap2b1 and Camk2a—are similarly regulated in 10% CR and IF conditions (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting that these genes could be part of the underlying mechanisms shared by both conditions. This is particularly relevant for Camk2a that has been implicated with neuroplasticity and learning [70].  We also report that the longevity gene Kl was among the top genes significantly upregulated in the IF condition only. Kl has been shown to prevent aging-related symptoms [27, 46] and extend the life span of mice [71], two established effects of IF [4].",fa596fd1-9cc2-47ee-b2f1-b2e518b48d34
42,discussion10," Given that IF was also associated with increased levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), we hypothesized that increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) might be occurring via Kl upregulation and undertook assays in a controlled in vitro environment and ex vivo histological analyses of hippocampal slices of Kl mutant mice.  In the in vitro assays, Kl overexpression increased the proportion of neuronal cells but had no effect on the proportion of dividing cells. When Kl was knocked down, neuronal differentiation also decreased, supporting that Kl plays a role in neuronal fate determination. The proportion of apoptotic cells was also significantly increased under Kl knockdown and aligned with previous evidence supporting Kl’s ability to modulate cell death [72].",dd64d463-e866-4de3-9b4a-0a3b2eaf0c40
43,discussion11," Furthermore, the Kl-binding siRNAs used here prevented the transcription of secreted KL RNA; it is known that secreted KL increases resistance to oxidative stress [73] and inhibits tumor necrosis factor α and tumor growth factor β signaling pathways [74]. In addition, secreted KL promotes longevity by inhibiting insulin/IGF-1 signaling [55]. Kl has also been shown to participate in glutamatergic signaling in the brain [25, 75], and glutamate is known to influence neurogenic stages such as neuronal commitment [76]. In the present study, “stress response” was one of the strongest enrichment terms for IF-linked genes when compared to CR, suggesting an upregulation of adaptive cellular stress response pathways that promote neuronal survival [12].",e71ea64e-27b7-4b59-bf1b-08b018826925
44,discussion12," Taken together, our findings suggest the convergence of multiple mechanisms that result in increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), although future in vitro studies investigating the effects of Kl on hippocampal neurogenesis using siRNA transfection should ideally use an increased number of biological replicates.  In alignment with our in vitro assays, the histological data of kl/kl mice showed that cell proliferation did not require Kl but early cell fate into neuroblasts and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) were significantly dependent on appropriate levels of KL. Notably, this finding was only observed in the DH, the axis most implicated in cognitive processing and spatial memory [77]. Although previous studies have demonstrated that Kl is important for adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) [32, 33], to our knowledge this is the first time that a gene has been proposed to regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) specifically in one axis of the hippocampus.",e675427f-05c6-4c5d-a337-b32d6d338710
45,discussion13," This finding is aligned with previous reports that showed Kl knockout mice exhibit impaired long-term memory recall without changes in emotionality [25, 78]. Conversely, overexpression of Kl in mice resulted in significantly better memory performance via augmentation of synaptic GluN2B unit levels in the hippocampus and cortex [25]. Improved learning and memory have also been found in mice 6 months following a single injection of the secreted isoform of KL [79]. In healthy humans, a variation in the Kl gene has also been associated with greater cortical volume and better cognition [80], as well as reduced risk for AD [81].  IF elicits adaptive cellular responses that are integrated in the periphery and within organs in a manner that improves glucose regulation, increases stress resistance, and suppresses inflammation [82].",522cdec7-6641-4d78-bc1b-3b9c73204e2c
46,discussion14," Therefore, our data showing that IF affects adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) with the expected behavioral consequences are likely just one of the mechanisms that contribute to IF’s role in cognition. Equally, Kl is expressed in multiple cell types, circulating in the blood, the cerebrospinal fluid, and provides the potential that Kl has widespread actions that likely affect cognition by multiple mechanisms than just through increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Finally, Kl is unlikely the sole mediator by which IF regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). For example, IF has been recently shown to alleviate diabetes-induced cognitive impairment via the gut microbiota [83]. It is still to be definitively determined whether Kl-mediated increases in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) following IF improve cognitive performance.",723d6cc2-8a5e-4c92-8253-6e2fa3fc2031
47,discussion15," One way to fully answer this hypothesis would be to apply an IF regimen to Kl mutant mice followed by an investigation of cognitive function and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). This experiment, however, would probably need to be done with conditionally knocked out animals, as the kl/kl mice utilized here are unlikely to survive full days of food restriction due to severe hypoglycemia that is a known cause of death in mice [84, 85]. Besides, Kl mice die prematurely at approximately 8–9 weeks of age [27] that was the starting age of our diet experiments. One possibility for future studies could be a careful titration of IF and CR in Kl mice and the consideration of an earlier start of the dietary regimen.  Another topic that deserves special attention is that of sex differences in neurogenesis. It is known that adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is differentially regulated in males and females [86].",523aff52-aca7-40c4-b4bf-51bc25ce639e
48,discussion16," While we have used both sexes in the histological analyses of Kl mice, we only used female mice in the diet experiments. Future studies should include females and males so that a more accurate picture of the behavioral, cellular, and molecular effects of energy restriction for both sexes is depicted. Nevertheless, the data presented here are relevant especially given that the activity of new neurons as recruited during spatial memory retrieval is similar across sexes [87].  In conclusion, we showed that IF is more effective in improving long-term memory retention and generating more newborn neurons in the DG when compared to 10% CR. Moreover, we found that Kl, the longevity gene, is upregulated by IF only and that Kl is required for appropriate hippocampal neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo, especially in the DH. Our findings suggest that IF has the potential to be a potent cognitive enhancer, a finding that holds promise for use in humans.",765d7c05-0b9e-4aa7-aa84-d977ec9221a3
49,discussion17," The search for the molecular pathways regulated by Kl in the hippocampus might also shed light on important pharmacological targets whose activation may mimic the beneficial effects of fasting on mental health.
