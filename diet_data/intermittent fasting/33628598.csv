12,results0," Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression is suppressed by obesity, and this suppression is restored by IF in AT.  Adipose Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 plays a vital role in regulating inflammation and energy expenditure by controlling synthesis of PGs (18, 20–23). To investigate whether obesity affects the expression levels of adipose Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in humans, we collected visceral fat samples from patients with obesity or overweight with BMI greater than 27 kg/m2 and lean control participants with BMI less than 25 kg/m2. Consistent with our previous finding that Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is downregulated in white adipose tissue (white adipose tissue (WAT)) of obese mice (26), we found that the protein and mRNA levels of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 were significantly reduced in visceral fat of human participants with obesity (Figure 1, A–C).",6981f37a-42f1-4382-bb5e-093e76c82fa3
13,results1," Interestingly, 15-cycle IF restored the protein and mRNA levels of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 but not of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 in epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) (ewhite adipose tissue (WAT)) and inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) (iwhite adipose tissue (WAT)) of mice with diet-induced obesity (Figure 1, D–I). Consistent with this, the expression levels of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 but not Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 in ewhite adipose tissue (WAT) were also significantly upregulated by 3-cycle IF (Supplemental Figure 1, A and B; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.153755DS1) and 15-cycle IF (Figure 1, J–L) in the mice fed a normal chow diet (NCD), although the induction of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in iwhite adipose tissue (WAT) was only observed in 15-cycle IF mice (Figure 1, M–O) but not in 3-cycle IF mice (Supplemental Figure 1, C and D).",4d581dd1-c6ea-4689-9c84-0c5f507d2afc
14,results2," The results suggest a negative correlation of adipose Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 with obesity in humans and that adipose Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 may be involved in IF-driven metabolic benefits.  Adipocyte-specific depletion of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 attenuates PG production and promotes age-related adipogenesis.  To characterize the physiological role of adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in regulating adipose and systemic metabolism, we generated adipocyte-specific Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice by crossing Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–floxed mice and adiponectin-cre mice. The results showed that both protein and mRNA levels of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 but not Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 in ewhite adipose tissue (WAT) and iwhite adipose tissue (WAT), and not in muscle, liver, pancreas, or brain tissue, were markedly downregulated by adipocyte-specific depletion of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (Figure 2, A–C).",26c8b1f1-11b7-4aa7-8167-34df0ba67f91
15,results3," A similar suppressing effect of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 depletion on Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 was observed in adipocytes (Supplemental Figure 1E). Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 deficiency in adipocytes suppressed the basal and IF-induced secretion of PGE2 in ewhite adipose tissue (WAT) and iwhite adipose tissue (WAT) (Figure 2D and Supplemental Figure 1, F and G). Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 deficiency also decreased the secretion levels of PGI2 in white adipose tissue (WAT) under basal and IF conditions (Figure 2E). PGD2 levels were not significantly affected by Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 deficiency and IF even with a slight increase in KO ewhite adipose tissue (WAT) (Supplemental Figure 1H).",da689d7a-6b7c-4b6c-9e3d-41fe538ba130
16,results4,"  Contrary to previous findings that global depletion of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 led to fat loss (19), the Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–deficient mice displayed a slight increase in fat mass and total body mass under normal chow diet (NCD) conditions at the age of 3 months (Supplemental Figure 1I) but to a greater extent in 6-month-old mice (Figure 2, F–H). The increased fat mass occurred in ewhite adipose tissue (WAT) and iwhite adipose tissue (WAT) with a slight increase in brown adipose tissue (brown adipose tissue (BAT)) of 6-month-old Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice compared with control littermates (Figure 2, F–I). Moreover, adipocyte size in iwhite adipose tissue (WAT) and ewhite adipose tissue (WAT) was increased by adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 deficiency (Figure 2, I–K). Consistent with this, Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–deficient mice exhibited slightly reduced glucose and insulin tolerance at 6 months of age but not at 3 months (Supplemental Figure 1, J–M).",59726957-9ed9-4fd6-bb3e-e3ff5bd6c418
17,results5," These data suggest that adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 maybe a key regulator of white adipose tissue (WAT) adipogenesis and function.  Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 deficiency in adipocytes suppresses Treg proliferation and type 2 inflammation in AT.  To investigate the role of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in regulating AT inflammation, we performed flow cytometry analysis to examine whether deficiency of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in adipocytes alters adipose immune compartment at age 6 months, using the strategy described in Supplemental Figure 2A. Despite no significant decrease in CD4+, CD3+, CD8+, or CD45+ T cells (Supplemental Figure 2, B–E), Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 deficiency decreased the frequency of CD4+Foxp3+ cells (Tregs) and the proportion of Tregs in CD4+ cells in ewhite adipose tissue (WAT) (Figure 3, A–C), suggesting the antiinflammatory effect of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in adipocytes.",becb4696-426b-4498-86a4-8545802b1dc5
18,results6," Moreover, both the fraction of Siglec-5–CD11b+CD206+ cells and the proportion of CD206+ macrophages in total macrophages were suppressed by Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 deficiency (Figure 3, D–F), accompanied with an increased proportion of M1 (Siglec-5–CD11b+CD206–) in total macrophage, decreased total macrophages, and reduced fraction of eosinophils (Siglec-5+CD11b+) (Supplemental Figure 2, F–H). In addition, the fraction of γδT cells was increased by Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 deficiency in ewhite adipose tissue (WAT) under normal chow diet (NCD) conditions (Figure 3, G–I).  Along this line, the mRNA levels of Treg markers, including Foxp3 and Gata3, were significantly decreased in Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice, while inflammatory factors Ifng and Il1b were upregulated with no significant effect on Il10, Il6, and Tnf (Figure 3J).",b2ce22b2-55f0-4f2c-81d0-556db3cc7310
19,results7," In agreement with the antiinflammatory property of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in adipocytes, the medium from Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO adipocytes did not maintain AT Treg proliferation, as indicated by the number of Foxp3+CD4+ cells, the proportion of Ki67+ Tregs in total Tregs, and expression levels of Foxp3, Gata3, Hpgd, and Il10, but not Tgfb1 (Figure 3, K–M).  Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in adipocytes is required for IF-driven metabolic improvement in AT inflammation and insulin sensitivity.  The marked induction of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression by IF in AT spurred us to investigate if Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in adipocytes mediates IF-elicited metabolic benefits (Figure 1, D–I). Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice and control littermates (6 weeks old) were fed an HFD for 8 weeks and then underwent alternate-day fasting (24-hour fasting followed by alternating 24-hour periods with free access to food) for 15 cycles.",ce0c420e-a4b0-4ba4-bb1c-7d0a05727f58
20,results8," We found that IF led to a robust decrease in fat mass, body mass, and fat cell size in white adipose tissue (WAT), as well as smaller lipid droplets in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and liver tissue in HFD-fed control mice (Figure 4, A–C, and Supplemental Figure 3, A–C), and the total food intake for each cycle was similar among the ad libitum (Ad), IF, control, and KO groups (Supplemental Figure 3D). However, although Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice displayed an increase in body mass, fat mass, and fat cell size, the antiobesity effect of IF was retained in Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice (Figure 4, A–C, and Supplemental Figure 3, A–C). The suppressing effects of IF on fat percentage, iwhite adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and fatty liver were attenuated by Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 deficiency (Figure 4, A and B, and Supplemental Figure 3, A and E).",027ad9d2-9b6b-4422-934f-54b1dca9074d
21,results9," On the other hand, IF restored HFD-decreased frequency of Tregs and mRNA levels of Foxp3, Gata3, Tgfb2, and Tgfb3 accompanied by a decreased γδT cell fraction (Figure 4, D–H, and Supplemental Figure 3, F and G). In agreement with this, insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 in liver and ewhite adipose tissue (WAT), as well as glucose and insulin tolerance, were improved by IF in HFD-fed mice (Figure 4, I–L, and Supplemental Figure 3H). However, the improvement in AT inflammation, insulin action, and insulin sensitivity were suppressed in Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice concurrently with decreased fractions of Tregs and CD206+ macrophages and an increased γδT cell population (Figure 4, D–L, and Supplemental Figure 3, F–H). Depleting Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in adipocytes suppressed IF-induced UCP1 and adiponectin expression and upregulated PPARγ expression levels in iwhite adipose tissue (WAT) (Supplemental Figure 3I).",9326ca90-e3be-4340-bffa-4d71af6047e4
22,results10,"  We asked if Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 induces thermogenic markers through VEGF and FGF21 pathways, given their role in fasting adaptive response and subsequent white adipose tissue (WAT) browning (28–30). Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 deficiency had little effect on basal and IF-induced Vegf expression and Fgf21 transcription in iwhite adipose tissue (WAT) (Supplemental Figure 3J). IF, however, suppressed transcription of proinflammatory genes Ifng and histocompatibility 2-class II antigen E beta (H2-Eb1) that have been shown to suppress AT Treg activation (14), which is independent of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in ewhite adipose tissue (WAT) (Supplemental Figure 3J). Our results suggest that adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 partially mediates IF-induced Treg proliferation and improved AT inflammation and insulin sensitivity, which may be obesity independent (Figure 4).",ca3b703e-32fe-43cb-8617-b1296d466236
23,results11,"  Adoptive transfer of Treg restores the impaired antiinflammatory response and insulin sensitivity in Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–deficient mice.  To determine whether the decrease in the Treg fraction mediates Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 deficiency–induced insulin resistance, we adoptively transferred CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs from Foxp3-eGFP mice into either Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice or control littermates. The CD4+GFP+ cells were selected from the isolated CD4+CD25+ cells and i.p. injected (1 × 105 cells/mouse) into male Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO and control mice fed an HFD for 8 weeks. BW measurement and glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed 14 days after the injection. Despite having no significant effects on BW (Figure 5A), adoptive transfer of Tregs increased the resident GFP+ cells and total CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs in ewhite adipose tissue (WAT) (Figure 5, B and C).",4143d25e-bbeb-4242-9023-890174f210b9
24,results12," The increased fraction of CD4+GFP+ cells as well as total CD4+Fxop3+ cells in Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO white adipose tissue (WAT) enhanced the γδT cell population and increased the CD206+ macrophage fraction (Figure 5, D–H). Consistent with this, adoptive transfer of Tregs restored insulin and glucose tolerance in Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice (Figure 5, I and J), indicating that resident Tregs are indispensable for the antiinflammatory and antidiabetic effects of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in adipocytes.  Adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 promotes Treg proliferation through PGE2.  To dissect the role of adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in regulating resident Tregs, we analyzed the production of PGs in Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO and control primary adipocytes. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 depletion suppressed the secretion of PGE2 and PGI2, but not PGD2, in adipocytes (Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure 3K), implying a PG-mediated paracrine mechanism.",47cd8ec1-f38e-4c78-86f0-78e3fecc7c42
25,results13," By treating AT Tregs with different doses of PGE2, PGI2, and PGD2, we found that PGE2, but not PGD2 or PGI2, significantly elevated the number of CD4+Fxop3+ Tregs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6B). Consistent with this, the treatment of 100 nM PGE2 elevated the proportion of Ki67-positive CD4+Fxop3+ Tregs in total Tregs (Figure 6C), suggesting that PGE2 may mediate the promoting effect of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 on Treg proliferation.  Given that PGE2 activates PKA, ERK1/2, Akt, and CaMKII in a variety of cell types (31–34), we treated differentiated Tregs with different doses of PGE2 for 1 hour. PGE2 treatment stimulated phosphorylation of PKA substrate and CaMKII, but not ERK1/2 and Akt, in Tregs (Figure 6D and Supplemental Figure 3L). Treatment with PGE2 for 1 hour also stimulated phosphorylation of CaMKII in AT Tregs (Figure 6E).",1d165793-4724-46aa-b244-69f783886889
26,results14," In addition, the promoting effect of PGE2 on cell proliferation was abolished by treating the cells with KT 5720, a specific inhibitor of PKA, or with TATCN21, a specific inhibitor of CaMKII, in AT Tregs (Figure 6F). Inhibiting PKA had a blocking effect on PGE2-induced stimulation of CaMKII in differentiated Tregs (Supplemental Figure 3M). In addition, CaMKII-KO Tregs isolated from AT exhibited lower response to PGE2-induced proliferation (Figure 6, G and H, and Supplemental Figure 3N). These findings suggest that PGE2 promotes Treg proliferation through the PKA-CaMKII axis.  PGE2/Treg axis is required for IF-elicited insulin sensitivity.  Given the mediatory role of PGE2 in adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–driven activation of Tregs, we were motivated to investigate whether PGE2 mediates Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–elicited beneficial effects under IF conditions. We administered 50 μg/kg PGE2 i.p. for 2 weeks in Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice fed an IF diet (Figure 7, A–E).",89a559c0-be8a-4096-a55e-e7b5c6601060
27,results15," Although BW was slightly decreased as a result of IF in Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice, PGE2 administration led to significant body mass loss in Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice under both IF and Ad conditions (Figure 7A). In addition, while IF had no significant effect on AT Treg populations and glucose and insulin tolerance in Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO mice, the reduced beneficial effects were improved by PGE2 treatment (Figure 7, B–E), indicating that PGE2 is downstream of adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and plays a critical role in Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–mediated metabolic improvement.  We also asked if PGE2 improves insulin sensitivity through induction of Tregs. We injected CD25 neutralizing antibody for 14 days to block Treg function in HFD C57BL/6 mice during PGE2 treatment. Administration of PGE2 increased Treg fraction in ewhite adipose tissue (WAT), which was inactivated by anti-CD25 treatment (Figure 7, F–H).",6d2b4ac3-0521-4024-b786-7da7e0d7f8b3
28,results16," Moreover, suppressing Treg function abrogated PGE2-elicited AT Treg induction and insulin sensitivity (Figure 7, I and J). These results suggest that Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in adipocytes, by regulating the Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2/PGE2 axis, plays a critical role in IF-driven metabolic benefits. Our data also show that adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is required for IF to promote resident Treg proliferation and improve adipose inflammation and insulin sensitivity (Figure 7K). ",64a52cc7-deac-4059-9cca-eb281cc8f701
29,discussion0," Caloric restriction promotes weight loss, improves health, and extends lifespan in adult humans and rodents with obesity (35–38). IF is an alternative to continuous caloric restriction that cycles between fasting and nonfasting over a defined period and has been attracting increased attention as an effective approach for weight loss, white adipose tissue (WAT) browning, and improvement of insulin sensitivity (3–5, 39–41). However, the precise mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of IF are incompletely understood. Our study demonstrates that adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is induced by IF and mediates IF-induced CD4+Foxp3+ Treg proliferation and IF-improved inflammation in AT through PGE2 (Figure 7K). In addition, PGE2 promotes Treg proliferation via a CaMKII-dependent mechanism (Figure 7K). Our results reveal that adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and its associated diseases.",302af250-ef1d-4ea3-85de-21b0133764b2
30,discussion1,"  Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 has been considered a key regulator of adipose inflammation and insulin resistance (20–23). However, the physiological signals that drive the activation of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in adipocytes remain largely unknown. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression is restricted under basal conditions in adipocytes and is induced by various environmental stimuli such as adrenoceptor agonists (20). In addition, Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression is tightly associated with lipolysis, a cellular process controlled by adrenergic signaling in adipocytes (18, 21, 42). In the present study, we found that Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in AT is suppressed by obesity in humans and in rodents and is restored by alternate-day fasting (Figure 1). In support of this, IF promotes production and release of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 PG products from adipocytes, including PGE2 and PGI2 (Figure 2, D and E).",c26d456b-f19f-4800-b7dc-4f2faac5afc8
31,discussion2," As a result, Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 senses fasting and overfeeding in adipose tissue and serves a key player of adipose tissue microenvironment (Figures 4 and 5).  The beneficial effects of IF on insulin sensitivity and antiinflammation were diminished in mice lacking Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in adipocytes, which is likely independent of an antiobesity effect (Figure 4), indicating that adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 senses fasting and refeeding and mediates the beneficial effects of IF. Consistent with previous observations in adipocyte-specific Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–overexpressed mice (43), we also observed the antiobesity property of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in the present study (Figure 4); however, the underlying mechanisms are currently unclear. We also observed that Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 was expressed in AT of female rodents and its expression levels also were suppressed by obesity in humans (Figure 1).",70e0dc63-9139-46ae-a0df-5775e1f07f5e
32,discussion3," Whether Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 exerts an antiobesity effect in female rodents and humans remains to be addressed.  Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 promotes energy metabolism, such as beige adipocyte formation (18, 26, 44–46). PGE2, PGI2, or PGD2 induces beige adipogenesis yet has no significant effect on the activation of differentiated beige adipocytes (26), suggesting that PG promotes progenitor cell commitment to beige adipogenesis rather than activation of adipocytes. IF has been linked to beige adipogenesis in previous studies (3). However, it is unclear whether adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 contributes to IF-induced white fat browning. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 deficiency suppresses thermogenic gene expression under IF conditions with little effect under normal diet conditions (Supplemental Figure 3I). The remarkable induction of adipose Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in IF-treated mice may explain this difference.",093046cd-e962-4e15-866b-d7a594a8bb4a
33,discussion4," In support of this, mTORC1 inactivation induces Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression and promotes beige adipocyte formation (26). Of note, adipocyte Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 only contributes 20%–30% of local PG production within AT (Figure 2, D and E). The contribution of adipocytes to the local PGs was significantly enhanced during fasting or starvation (Figure 2, D and E). Other metabolites, including fermentation products acetate and lactate and cytokines such as VEGF, mediate IF-elicited thermogenesis by targeting beige adipocytes and resident macrophages, respectively (3, 4). Our study suggests a new mechanism underlying IF-induced improvement in AT inflammation.  Although all 3 PGs (i.e., PGE2, PGD2, and PGI2) can facilitate beige adipocyte differentiation (26), only PGE2 exerts Treg-inducing effects by regulating its proliferation in white fat (Figure 6).",886fbe7f-1bcd-4175-b05d-7d8ca969aacc
34,discussion5," This observation is supported by the recent finding that enrichment of PGE2 favors the immune-suppressive effects of adipose resident Tregs through its derived metabolite 15-keto-PGE2 (47). In agreement with the antiinflammatory action of PGE2 (17, 23, 48), we found that PGE2 promotes Treg proliferation but not differentiation within AT. Our results are consistent with the findings of Sharma, Baratelli, and colleagues (49) that PGE2 induces Foxp3 expression and Treg function in human lymphocytes and in lung cancer. In addition, AT Tregs use PGE2 as a substrate to generate PPARγ ligand 15-keto-PGE2 with hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD)) to maintain AT homeostasis (47).",096c091f-8fdb-439c-806d-baf505ed60b6
35,discussion6," Consistent with this, hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD) expression in Tregs was suppressed by the medium from Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–KO adipocytes, compared with hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD) expression in the control sample (Figure 3M), suggesting that adipocytes may be an important source of PGE2 that promotes the immune suppressive activity of Tregs. It is unaddressed whether PGE2 activates CD206+ macrophages and decreases γδT cell populations through regulation of Tregs. Given that Tregs promote the polarization of macrophages to an M2 phenotype by releasing cytokine IL-10 (50, 51), it is possible that PGE2 via Tregs alternatively activates CD206+ macrophages.  Notably, the effects of PGE2 on Tregs are still under debate. Some studies have shown that PGE2 induces Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in lung and in vitro, inhibiting effector T cell responses (52–54). In human lymphocytes, PGE2 appears to induce Foxp3 expression and Treg function (49).",bd231cd5-46db-45d1-88f1-20d97d1a4c03
36,discussion7," However, PGE2 was also reported to inhibit Treg differentiation via the EP2-cAMP/PKA signaling pathway (55). Consistent with the mediatory role of cAMP/PKA pathway in PGE2 action on T cells (56, 57), we observed that PGE2 treatment activated PKA and subsequently stimulated CaMKII activation and Treg proliferation (Figure 6F). Consistent with this, CaMKII-KO Tregs had an impaired response to PGE2 in terms of proliferation (Figure 6, G and H). The communication between adipocytes and Tregs is crucial for Treg proliferation, which also explains the relatively high percentage of Tregs (24%) in total CD4+ T cells in AT (Figure 3C) that we observed. Downregulation of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 may be responsible for the decrease in the Treg fraction and subsequent adipose inflammation in obesity (Figure 4D). In contrast, activating the Ptgs2 gene in adipocytes provides an approach to restoring AT Tregs and improving AT inflammation.",129e8bca-394a-4acd-b212-85feed157427
37,discussion8,"  IF is suggested to bean effective way to improve adipose function and glucose homeostasis through targeting Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and elevating PGE2 levels in AT (Figure 4D). On the other hand, while acute PGE2 levels have antiobesity and antiinflammatory effects in AT, whether chronic treatment of PGE2 potentially causes unwanted effects such as fever, increased metabolic rate, changes in activity level, systemic inflammation or pain, or reduced appetite and food intake necessitates further clarification.  In summary, our data show for the first time, to our knowledge, that adipocyte-derived PGE2 serves as a paracrine signal that promotes resident Treg proliferation by activating the PKA/CaMKII pathway. In addition, adipocyte-derived PGE2 mimics IF to elicit metabolic benefits, including Treg proliferation, type 2 inflammation, and insulin sensitivity. Our study shows that the Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2/PGE2 axis in adipocytes is a checkpoint of AT inflammation in obesity.",967517dd-3a94-47fa-84a0-706aebadf2ba
38,discussion9," Moreover, this work provides critical insight into the mechanisms by which lipokines and immune cell populations contribute to IF-related mediation of obesity-related illness. ",fcd268ab-dd76-4685-adb2-4a6eebdf7528
