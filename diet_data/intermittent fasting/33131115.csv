0,methods0," This integrative scientific review study includes epidemiological and clinical studies i.e., randomized clinical trials, cohort studies, and systematic reviews. We have evaluated the list of references of systematic reviews to check whether a particular article could be relevant and match our inclusion criteria.  The populations studied were adult women, including pregnant women, or studies that carried out a separate analysis by sex, allowing us to extract the data for women. Studies with adolescents and older adults were not included.  The interventions included were several types of diets, such as: the Mediterranean (Mediterranean (MED)) diet, the Traditional Brazilian Diet, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)), intermittent fasting (IF), calorie (energy) restriction, food re-education, low-carb and very low-carb diet also named as very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD)).",cac590e7-930e-478d-918d-443ffd4cb6ef
1,methods1," In the cohort studies, we have analyzed the impact of food patterns such as the Mediterranean diet during the follow-up period.  There were no language restrictions, and we have considered the last 20 years of publication. We have included the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Scielo and Web of Science.  As one of the aims was to analyze cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) and their risk factors, we have used various types of cardiovascular disease (CVD)s: heart failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathies, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease. With regards to cancer, we used all kinds of malignancies and neoplasms.  body mass index (BMI) is not the most appropriate method to diagnose obesity. However, we have included this measure on the definition of obesity and overweight due to its wide use in epidemiological and clinical studies.",b41408f9-6ce0-4ea9-a294-8f8f68693357
2,methods2," We have considered women to be obese when their body mass index (BMI) was >30 kg/m2 and overweight when it was >25 kg/m2 [12]. We also included abdominal obesity measured by waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (waist hip ratio (WHR)) and body composition with percentage of body fat (%BF). The main outcomes were loss or reduction of weight, body mass index (BMI), WC or %BF, and we also included cancer and cardiovascular risk factors.  3. Impact of Several Types of Diet  3.1. Low-Carb and Very Low-Carb Diet  Low-carbohydrate diets emphasize restriction of carbohydrate, which might be replaced with fat and/or protein. However, an agreement on the amount of restriction that determines a low-carbohydrate diet is still a matter of discussion [13,14]. A definition has been proposed based on several publications of experimental studies.",ad612243-7df2-42f7-9144-5b3412204907
3,methods3," Thus, there is a general agreement that “very low-carbohydrate diets” (Vlow carbohydrate diet (LCD)s) comprise an intake of less than 20 g of carbohydrates per day. In some studies, the threshold is less than 50 g per day, equivalent to about 10% of total energy intake. For “low-carbohydrate diets” (low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s), carbohydrate daily intake should reach a maximum of 130 g per day, which is equivalent to less than 26% of total energy [14,15,16,17].  Usually, the low carbohydrate diet (LCD) interventions in clinical trials are compared to low-fat diets (low fat diet (LFD)s) [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. Several meta-analyses have found favorable effect on weight loss for low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s over low fat diet (LFD)s [18,19,20,21,22,23,24], while other meta-analyses found similar results when comparing low carbohydrate diet (LCD) to low fat diet (LFD) or balanced diets [25,26,27].",15f36327-a225-4f0a-b93a-a85fc3a236c2
4,methods4," Additionally, it seems that in the long-term, the effects of low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s and Vlow carbohydrate diet (LCD)s on weight loss may not be superior to more conventional strategies, such as calorie-restricted, low-fat diets and high-carbohydrate low-fat diets [17]. Regarding cardiometabolic risk markers, as observed for weight loss, the results are inconsistent when comparing low carbohydrate diet (LCD) and Vlow carbohydrate diet (LCD) to high-CHO and low-fat diets for high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), triglyceride (TG), blood pressure, serum glucose and insulin [16,17].  Few studies have been conducted exclusively with women [28,29,30,31] while some have mostly women in their sample i.e., 64% to 89% [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39]. In addition, there were controversial results for weight loss and obesity outcomes, such as fat mass, waist circumference and visceral fat mass.",7dc4f160-6c96-47b8-8139-f1f9980eaf1e
5,methods5," However, most studies have shown no difference for low carbohydrate diet (LCD) compared to low fat diet (LFD) or commercial diets such as Zone, Learn and Ornish diets [30,31,32,34,35,36,37,38,39]. Out of six studies [31,33,34,35,36,37] with at least one year of follow-up just one observed greater weight and fat mass reduction for low carbohydrate diet (LCD) compared to low fat diet (LFD) (mean difference in change of −3.5 kg [95% CI, −5.6 to −1.4 kg] for weight and −1.5% [CI, −2.6% to −0.4%] for fat mass). There was no significant difference for waist circumference reduction between diets [33] (Table 1).  For cardiometabolic outcomes, low carbohydrate diet (LCD) and low fat diet (LFD) frequently improve blood pressure, lipid, glucose and insulin parameters, but many studies seem to report greater reduction in triglycerides levels and increases in HDL-cholesterol for low carbohydrate diet (LCD) compared to low fat diet (LFD) [31,33,34,35,36,39].",5b7861b7-132c-4c1e-91a6-8ba0cce8cf96
6,methods6," Only one randomized clinical trial investigated a very-low-carbohydrate diet in cancer. A ketogenic diet (<20 g/d of carbohydrate intake) was compared to the American Cancer Society diet (ACS; high-fiber, low-fat) after 12-weeks of follow-up in women with ovarian or endometrial cancer and found greater visceral fat mass and fasting serum insulin reduction for Vlow carbohydrate diet (LCD) compared to the ACS diet [29]. The authors also hypothesized that the elevated serum β-hydroxybutyrate could reflect a metabolic environment inhospitable to cancer proliferation [29].  Polycystic ovary syndrome (Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)) has an important impact on women’s health. The use of low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s to decrease body weight and facilitate the treatment of infertility in women with obesity with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been investigated.",647d0b76-d549-4a91-8532-1305c1d9902a
7,methods7," A systematic review of seven studies found that reduced carbohydrate load can reduce circulating insulin levels, improve hormonal imbalance and resume ovulation to improve pregnancy rates compared to usual diet in overweight and women with obesity [40]. A meta-analysis of eight randomized clinical trials including 327 women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) found that low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s compared to a control diet significantly improved body mass index (BMI), lipid levels (total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol), Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), testosterone (T), sex hormone-binding globulin (sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)), and follicle-stimulating hormone (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)), especially in the long-term (> 4 weeks) and when low carbohydrate diet (LCD) was a low-fat/low CHO diet [41].",b716798d-9136-42e7-87c2-14e5f1482435
8,methods8,"  Previous meta-analyses of cohort studies have investigated the relationship between carbohydrate intake and all-cause mortality, and also mortality related to other outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, in the general population [42,43,44,45]. Some meta-analyses have found an association of low carbohydrate diet (LCD) or low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets with increased all-cause mortality [42,43]. A meta-analysis observed that the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and incidence were not significantly increased, while another meta-analysis showed that cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebrovascular and cancer mortality were greater for higher scores of low carbohydrate diet (LCD) evaluated as quartiles with the highest quartile related to the lowest carbohydrate intake [43]. Two meta-analyses observed that both low carbohydrate diet (LCD) (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.09–1.32) and high-carbohydrate diets (HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.11–1.",7cd70bfc-b079-4696-a9e9-ef4ebd6cb545
9,methods9,"36) were associated with an increased mortality risk [44,45]. In contrast, one of these meta-analyses analysed the source of protein of the diet and it was observed that low carbohydrate diet (LCD) high in plant-based sources of protein and fat was associated with a lower risk of total (HR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83–0.94 for highest versus lowest quintile), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.73–0.92 for highest versus lowest quintile) [45]. Thus, the relationship between carbohydrate restriction and all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality remains unclear.  In general, the restriction of carbohydrates for women’s health seems to promote similar results in weight loss and body composition compared to low fat diet (LFD). For cardiometabolic outcomes, low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s and Vlow carbohydrate diet (LCD)s may promote similar results as control diets.",ac6ad906-61cb-46e6-a2b8-c1e463393625
10,methods10," However, for triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol levels, low carbohydrate diet (LCD) seem to show better improvements than low fat diet (LFD). Thus, low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s and Vlow carbohydrate diet (LCD) can be good options to achieve improvements in weight and cardiometabolic parameters, but they are difficult adhere to over an extended period. Furthermore, it is reasonable to advise patients regarding the quality of carbohydrate intake, choosing those options associated with reduced cardiometabolic risk, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes.  3.2. The Mediterranean Diet  Due to synergistic effects between various nutrients, foods, phytonutrients and compounds, focusing on dietary patterns is a better approach to evaluate the relationship between diet and disease [46].",982c1d25-ea2c-448c-88a3-73ae4cd92671
11,methods11," The Mediterranean (MED) is one of the healthiest dietary pattern in decreasing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer risks [47,48] and has been associated with a 12–28% lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and all-cause mortality [49]. The improvement effect of Mediterranean (MED) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer may be mediated by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, obesity indicators, blood pressure, lipid profiles, glucose level and insulin resistance [50].  A recent meta-analysis of 57 RCTs illustrated that Mediterranean (MED) has reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, angina, pre-diabetes, breast cancer, but not metabolic syndrome (MetS) [51]. A large cross-sectional study conducted with 497,308 European adults (71% women) from ten countries suggested that a higher adherence to Mediterranean (MED) was associated with a lower WC [52].",c4588eeb-cfb9-42e2-a11d-d019d2fec256
12,methods12," In addition, intensive lifestyle modification including Mediterranean (MED) and exercise in one RCT reduced body mass index (BMI) and altered lipid profiles [53].  Low adherence to Mediterranean (MED) was more frequent in women with obesity and was associated with an increased asymptomatic atherosclerosis occurrence [54]. Abdominal obesity is a common component of menopausal MetS [55]. The valuable effects of Mediterranean (MED) in reducing overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity indicators in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [56,57] was associated with lower estrogen levels [58]. Adiposity, obesity-related breast cancer as well as menopausal status have been associated with the methylation levels of the ZNF577 gene [59,60,61,62]. Furthermore, the Mediterranean (MED) can moderate the various genes’ methylation like ZNF577 related to noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) [63], stroke [64], and cancer [65]. Lorenzo et al.",cd9c0a28-01eb-44e1-adcd-1f888f3c1758
13,methods13," showed that a greater adherence to Mediterranean (MED) was associated with higher methylation levels of ZNF577 [66]. Mediterranean (MED) diet also had beneficial changes on weight loss and maintenance, WC, waist hip ratio (WHR), body fat and some inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and TNF-a after a 4-month period, compared to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s MyPyramid diet in breastfeeding women [67].  A meta-analysis of six trials reported that compared to low fat diet, Mediterranean (MED) diet had greater long-term favorable effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors like body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol and inflammatory markers such as hs-CRP in individuals with obesity [68].",ccd3f167-5bb8-44b9-ac23-03583a4634ea
14,methods14," Another RCT found that the Central European Diet (Central European Diet (CED)) and Mediterranean (MED) with calorie restriction (CR) had significantly reduced the effect on body weight, blood pressure and metabolic biomarkers including insulin, HOMA2-IR, total cholesterol, triglyceride, with no difference between diets on postmenopausal women with abdominal obesity and at least one other MetS component [69]. Thus, it was concluded that CR, irrespective of their macronutrient compositions, could improve obesity and other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors [69]. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis of thirty RCTs with moderate quality evidence in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and low-quality evidence of little or no effect in secondary prevention indicated a significant blood pressure reduction in Mediterranean (MED) compared to no diet as well as reductions in triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol levels compared to another diet in primary prevention.",ea08113a-3433-43aa-9418-4bb1472a476f
15,methods15," However, there were no changes in secondary prevention. Thus, it was concluded that there was uncertainty related to the effect of Mediterranean (MED) on preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) [70] (Table 2).  The favorable effects of Mediterranean (MED) are likely due to synergistic interactions among diverse elements of this diet rather than specific food groups [71]. Some potential mechanisms which explain the cardio-protective role and obesity prevention of Mediterranean (MED) are its beneficial effects on insulin resistance, endothelium-dependent vasoreactivity, oxidation and inflammation biomarkers [72,73].  Current evidence has shown a protective effect of Mediterranean (MED) in the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in women with obesity in different life cycles. This could be attributed to the various genes’ methylation related to NCDs such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) [63] and cancer [65].",a1b083e5-04cd-46c9-bfe4-993aa334fdad
16,methods16," The Mediterranean (MED) also had beneficial changes in weight loss and maintenance, reduction of body fat and inflammatory factors [67]. However, there is some controversy about the effect of Mediterranean (MED) on the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [70].  3.3. The Traditional Brazilian Diet  A diet pattern named the Traditional Brazilian Diet [74,75,76,77] was tested in a randomized clinical trial as a treatment in individuals with class II/III obesity (body mass index (BMI) = 35 kg/m2), in which more than 85% of the sample where women. We have decided to include this diet in this review due to its features, such as being a kind of plant-based and reduced ultra-processed foods. It is a healthy diet pattern which can be easily incorporated in eating habits due to its common food components such as rice, beans, fruits, and vegetables largely consumed in many cultures.",918b8507-c3c0-4afb-b20a-49bd0c68cfd6
17,methods17," This diet pattern does not include food such as nuts, olive oil, seafood and wine, which can be difficult to find in most countries or are expensive for people who live in low- or middle-income countries. A comparative analysis of the Mediterranean (MED) and Traditional Brazilian diets can be found in a previous publication [77].  To better characterize the Traditional Brazilian Diet, consider a dinner plate and divide its half into three parts that will be one part rice, one part beans and one part lean red or white meat. The other half of the plate will be filled with boiled or raw vegetables in the form of salad, grilled or baked culinary preparations [74,75,76,77].  Cardiovascular risk is a public health issue worldwide, which increases the risk of mortality mainly in postmenopausal women. Therefore, it is important to reduce this risk factor.",665bfbfa-d1ab-427f-afd7-419fd1e6f25b
18,methods18," The Traditional Brazilian Diet intervention was effective in decreasing some cardiometabolic risk parameters in individuals with severe obesity, mainly LDL-cholesterol, HbA1c, triglycerides and triglycerides/HDL ratio [77]. This diet pattern had not been analyzed in terms of its impact on cancer. Overall, women have a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression [74]. In the abovementioned RCT, in which 85% of the sample were women, the Traditional Brazilian Diet showed a significant reduction of 46% of anxiety symptoms, 50% of depression and 67% of both anxiety and depression [74]. After a 12-week follow-up, those participants with severe obesity had a mean weight reduction of −2.83 ± 5.79 kg [74]. Even a modest weight loss can lead to health benefits. This diet pattern has been shown to be more effective in reducing other risk factors that affect women with severe obesity than weight loss itself.",eaae7f6e-6824-43b2-ad80-aee87ecdecdf
19,methods19," The Traditional Brazilian Diet can potentially be a good option to treat women with obesity when the objectives are to reduce cardiometabolic risk, depression, and anxiety symptoms.  3.4. Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)  The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is a dietary pattern originally developed to treat hypertension without medication by the United States National Institutes of Health (National Institutes of Health (NIH)). It is characterized for eating a high number of vegetables which will result in high levels of potassium, magnesium, and calcium, and limits the consumption of macro- and micronutrients that have been pointed out as a risk factor for hypertension, as total and saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has mainly fruit and vegetables, low-fat dairy foods, whole grains, nuts, and legumes and low consume of red and processed meats, sweets, and sugar-sweetened beverages [78,79].",8a8ab04c-5962-4370-909e-f188ad4f91fd
20,methods20,"  There is relevant evidence of Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) on prevention and treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular risk, such as reducing body weight, LDL-C and insulin. Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is recommended by the international diabetes and cardiovascular clinical association guidelines [80,81,82,83].  Some studies that have evaluated Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in overweight and individuals with obesity do not present data stratified by sex [84,85,86]. In a meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled clinical trials, which included 2292 overweight and adults with obesity [87], only three studies presented women’s data separately (n = 213) [88,89,90]. The main findings showed a significant association between Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and body mass index (BMI) reduction, compared to the control diet [87]. Some studies have been conducted only with women [91,92,93,94], as shown in Table 3.",7f4b3cc9-1b71-4434-ad27-4489baf4c3fd
21,methods21," Four randomized clinical trials have assessed the consumption of calorie-restricted Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet compared to a calorie-restricted control diet in overweight and women with obesity with polycystic ovary syndrome for 8–12 weeks [91,92,93,94]. The calorie-restricted Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet resulted in greater body weight, body mass index (BMI) [91,92,93,94], fat mass, WC [91] and hip [94] circumferences reduction. These clinical trials also evaluated cardiometabolic outcomes and found a greater reduction in insulin levels, HOMA-IR score, triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol, total antioxidant capacity, total glutathione, and nitric oxide in overweight and women with obesity with polycystic ovary syndrome after a calorie-restricted Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [91,92,93,94] (Table 3).",92104647-47c5-429a-9365-798aa0459297
22,methods22,"  A cohort study with 1760 pregnant women found no association between adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet during early pregnancy, compared to a control diet, and pregnancy outcomes or complications. However, adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was unexpectedly associated with greater gestational weight gain in women with obesity before pregnancy [95]. The Women’s Health Initiative, a cohort study with 93,122 postmenopausal women, found no association between a higher Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score and cardiovascular mortality. They found an association between higher Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet quintiles and lower body mass index (BMI) and lower waist-to-hip ratio [96].",2c5adbba-0c9c-47f3-a16b-0b863562b56d
23,methods23,"  The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet seems to be effective to reduce and control cardiovascular diseases, as well as reducing weight in women with obesity [87,91,92,93,94,96], except for pregnant women with obesity [95]. The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may be relevant to treat obesity, mainly when the focus is to reduce cardiometabolic risk; however, the impact of this eating pattern on cancer has not been analysed.  3.5. Intermittent Fasting  The Intermittent fasting (IF) diet has become increasingly popular for weight reduction in the past two decades. It generally involves a calorie restriction of 75–90% with 1–3 days/week of fasting [97]. The IF includes alternate day fasting (alternate day fasting (ADF)) (25% of energy needs on fasting days; 125% of energy needs on alternating “feast days”) and periodic fasting (PF). There have been some controversies in the effect of IF and CR diets in human studies [98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107].",0b3944fb-e5ac-4f9e-8e7c-7fd606b95277
24,methods24,"  A RCT indicated similar effects of alternate day fasting (ADF) and CR diets on reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, weight loss and weight maintenance after one year [98]. Another RCT showed circulating leptin reduction and increased free fat mass (free fat mass (FFM)) to total mass ratio without affecting the visceral adipose tissue to subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT: SAT) ratio and other adipokines during a 24-week intervention. However, HOMA-IR had a greater reduction in alternate day fasting (ADF) compared to the CR group [99]. Contrary to the assumption of easier compliance in alternate day fasting (ADF), this study showed less sustainability of alternate day fasting (ADF) due to dissatisfaction of subjects with long-term alternate day fasting (ADF) compared with CR [98]. A RCT in overweight and women with obesity also revealed similar improvements in body composition through these two interventions [100].",9d06cf3b-62f2-456c-9ebe-83427a2f6378
25,methods25,"  Time restricted eating (Time restricted eating (TRE)) has been shown to result in good weight management and cardiometabolic beneficial effects including reduction in body weight, VAT, total fat mass, fasting blood glucose (fasting blood glucose (FBG)), impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, appetite and inflammatory markers [101,102,103]. Especially, increasing the time of fasting from 12 to 14 h per day could produce more improvements in weight loss and fasting blood glucose (FBG) [102].  An RCT among overweight and with obesity East Asians in Hawaii showed a significant reduction in obesity indicators, including body weight, body mass index (BMI), WC, VAT, SAT, body fat percent and total fat mass.",456e58e6-6178-47c8-a49b-4c3dccd54373
26,methods26," However, there was no reduction of the VAT: SAT after IF: Mediterranean (MED) (2 consecutive days with 70% energy restriction: 5 days euenergetic Mediterranean (MED)) compared to euenergetic Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet after 12 weeks. There was also a decrease in the total lean body mass and muscle [104]. A recent review by Dong et al. showed that both IF and CR diets could reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors including hypertension, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. In addition, IF was linked with cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in cardiac patients and weight reduction in individuals with obesity. The potential mechanisms for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention of IF consist of improving oxidative stress, promoting ketogenesis and a close relationship with the circadian rhythm hypothesis.",9bfee1a1-6e51-408d-a28f-ceff43dc6bf9
27,methods27," Due to the time restricted nature of fasting, IF has better adherence and hence increased chance of more weight reduction in individuals with obesity than CR diet [105]. A meta-analysis of seven RCTs among 269 subjects demonstrated that alternate day fasting (ADF) for at least one month could reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, lean mass, blood pressure, and improve cardiometabolic risk factors including total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides levels compared with the control group in normal weight and participants with obesity. For the first time, this meta-analysis illustrated that alternate day fasting (ADF) could have greater beneficial effects than CR diet in normal and overweight individuals. alternate day fasting (ADF) plus physical activity produced superior cardiometabolic improvements and weight related indicators such as the least decrease in lean mass compared with alternate day fasting (ADF) alone [106].",e5758907-e262-4893-a86a-eba73019bfe8
28,methods28," Some studies on women showed the improvement effects of IF on obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. A 24-week RCT with women with obesity showed body weight, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides reductions of 7%, 10% and 17%, respectively [107].  A combination of IF with CR diet (IF with CR diet (IFCR)) showed a stronger effect in reducing weight and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors compared to each intervention alone [108]. In addition, a RCT in women with obesity showed that IF with CR diet (IFCR) in its liquid (IF with CR diet (IFCR)-L) had a stronger effect in reducing body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass VAT, glucose, insulin, heart rate, total cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol as well as LDL-cholesterol particle size, but no changes on fat-free mass, SAT, blood pressure and CRP compared to with normal food (IF with CR diet (IFCR)-F) in weight loss period.",364253ad-e474-4a0e-8d2a-1b67ba2e7c66
29,methods29," The greater weight loss and hence other better cardioprotective effect of the IF with CR diet (IFCR)-L intervention is likely to be attributed to its better dietary adherence [108].  Different types of IF diet can have a reduction effect on obesity and body composition. However, it can be complicated to sustain the use of IF for a prolonged period. In addition, IF may reduce various cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in cardiac patients. We summarized the main evidence for IF in studies conducted in women in Table 4.  3.6. General Healthy Diet and/or Food Re-Education  Healthy eating is defined as a diet capable of promoting health and preventing diseases, reducing the risk of being overweight/with obesity and to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer [109].",8a454f24-58f7-4d91-9a1a-e5a3fd8523a6
30,methods30," General public health recommendations on healthy eating to prevent NCDs include frequent consumption of fruits, vegetables and legumes, oilseeds and whole grains and limited intake of saturated fat, trans fat, sugar and salt [109,110,111,112]. As a general recommendation for the entire population, the combination of foods and meals should also consider the traditional/cultural dietary patterns of each population and sustainable food systems. In other words, involving a diversified diet, considering cultural traditions, geographical and environmental aspects [112]. A systematic review showed an association between diet quality indices and lower percentage of body fat, lower body mass index (BMI) and abdominal obesity, and lower weight gain in adults of both sexes [113].",7b89a3b7-d3b4-4938-9185-55b75af95956
31,methods31,"  Regarding meals, a 12-week randomized clinical trial with 93 overweight and women with obesity with metabolic syndrome compared the weight loss in two isocaloric diets (1400 kcal): one diet with high caloric intake during breakfast (700 kcal) (BF) and the other diet with high caloric intake at dinner (700 kcal) (D). The BF group showed greater weight loss, waist circumference, serum ghrelin and lipids, and insulin resistance indices reduction than the D group [114]. Two other randomized controlled trials evaluated the association between snack and weight loss in women and their results indicated that a reduced-calorie diet containing snacks may contribute to weight loss, depending on whether snacks consist of healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and dark chocolate or reflect unhealthy eating habits and may in fact contribute to weight gain [115,116] (Table 5).  Most studies have assessed women with obesity during their reproductive period, including pregnancy.",c2469722-148e-4715-8b73-60779c2c5547
32,methods32," During this period, a healthy and balanced diet, associated with nutritional education provided by a nutritionist/dietitian, has been shown to be crucial to prevent excessive weight gain and postpartum weight retention in women [117,118,119,120,121,122]. It also is a protective factor for the occurrence of gestational diabetes and hypertension, and pre-eclampsia [119,123].  A randomized clinical trial [121] and a systematic review [119] demonstrated that sugary food consumption was a risk factor for greater gestational weight gain in a cohort study of 46,262 pregnant women [122]. Women eating healthier diets, assessed by the Healthy Eating Index, have a lower risk of cancer mortality, according to a meta-analysis of cohort studies that evaluated 638,770 adult women [124].  We have used the NOVA classification to define healthy eating.",f97a9553-88f2-4524-92ca-25dc9591eab1
33,methods33," That is, the major consumption of fresh and minimally processed foods, with the contribution of culinary ingredients and processed foods, characterizing culinary preparations [125,126,127,128,129]. Regarding NOVA, we did not find randomized controlled trials evaluating the impact of food consumption on women with obesity. A recent meta-analysis presented data from two studies showing a significant association between the consumption of ultra-processed foods and greater gestational weight gain in pregnant women [130].  Public health policies and programs to support population to promote a healthy food environment are important instruments for the prevention of obesity and other NCDs and require the involvement of government, the public and private sectors [131].",8bfe7730-1b4d-4cae-824b-ab519ecda0db
34,methods34," Food guides with graphic representations of the diet [132] and healthy eating recommendations are part of these initiatives and are relevant guidelines for the general population to adopt new healthy eating habits [132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141]. Another example is the program 5-a-day, which is a campaign to help people ensure that they eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day [142,143,144,145]. In view of the prominence of this theme for health promotion and disease prevention, as well as the lack of specific recommendations targeted at women, it is relevant to have programs that focus their approach on specific recommendations for them.  4. Conclusions  The Med [146], Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) [80,87,147] and the Traditional Brazilian Diet [74,75,76,77,148] have in common the feature of being varieties of “plant-based diet” with the incorporation of natural foods and a reduction of ultra-processed foods.",8e2f5f11-4743-473d-9ec9-f82ebddb3f19
35,methods35," These diets have shown good results for women’s health through the prevention and treatment of obesity in their different life cycles [149], and there is also evidence of a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in individuals with obesity. In addition, these diets promote a reduction in low-grade inflammation that affects individuals with obesity. Therefore, it is worth following the campaigns of “unpack less and peel more” as ways to reduce the consumption of industrialized products, especially those with high concentrations of sugar, sodium and sugary drinks, and to increase the consumption of natural foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s, Vlow carbohydrate diet (LCD) diets [31,33,34,35,36,37] and IF [107,108] seem to promote interesting results with regards to weight control and reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer risk in women with obesity.",d1ff74a1-974f-442a-bda7-7cc7536b0f86
36,methods36," However, such diets may be difficult to adhere to over an extended period. From a dietary point of view, we must consider that a healthy diet should be learned and incorporated into the daily routine and not only for some periods with a focus only on weight loss. This type of nutritional treatment, which relies mostly on the adoption of a healthier dietary pattern and food education, is the best approach to prevent and treat overweight and obesity in women and to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer risk.
