2,methods2," Following screening and informed consent, participants were issued a 4-day food diary to monitor dietary intake for one week prior to starting the study and completed questionnaires related to physical activity (IPAQ) to ascertain baseline dietary intake and physical activity levels. Baseline testing (Week 0) was completed over 2 days. On day 1, participants arrived at the research testing facility between 0700 and 0900 to undertake the following: (1). Assessment of body weight and waist to hip ratio, (2). Body composition scan via dual x ray absorptiometry (DXA), (3). Fasting blood sample collection and (4). Oral glucose tolerance test (Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)). On day 2, participants arrived at the same time as the previous day and underwent cardiovascular analysis (blood pressure and pulse wave velocity) followed by aerobic capacity testing (VO2max). The aforementioned measures were repeated in weeks 8 and 16 of the study.",02122368-073a-48e5-96de-5e73a588b226
3,methods3," Participants were required to complete weekly 4-day food logs (3 non-fasting days and 1 fasting day for both fasting groups) and activity questionnaires (IPAQ).  2.3. Randomisation and Intervention Protocols  Participants were randomly allocated on a 1:1:1 basis to either 16 weeks of twice-weekly fasting (5:2) diet, three sessions a week of SIT, or a combination of the two protocols. Block randomisation was used in an attempt to match groups based on baseline body mass index (BMI), age, predictive daily calorie intake and physical activity levels.  The 5:2 IF only group restricted energy intake for two non-consecutive days per week for 16 weeks, with ad libitum food intake for the remaining five days of the week. Fasting day intake was limited to a single 600 kilocalorie (kcal) and 500 kcal meal for men and women, respectively, as well as ad libitum consumption of water and unsweetened black tea.",00b5cb86-b655-4635-a340-afae7cfff6b1
4,methods4," Dietary advice and sample recipes in line with current Australian nutritional guidelines [26] was provided on fasting and non-fasting days.  The SIT group attended three supervised training sessions per week for 16 weeks consisting of 4 × 20 s work at 150% VO2peak followed by 40 s of active rest at 50 watts on a magnetically braked bicycle ergometer (Lode Excalibur, Lode B.V., Groningen, The Netherlands). Workload was increased from four to six repetitions over the first 4 weeks and remained at six intervals for the study duration. Three-minutes of warm-up and warm-down (at 50 watts of resistance) before and after the exercise period were also included. Participants were required to attend a minimum of 85% of training sessions, with any participant falling below this threshold excluded from the final analysis.  Participants in the combined group (IF/SIT) followed the same dietary protocol as per the IF only group and the exercise protocol as per the SIT only group.",f97966da-23bc-4bd9-bfb2-d58e01997fae

Body Weight, Height and Body Mass Index  Height and weight was measured in a fasted state (minimum 8 h) and after voiding the bladder using a wall mounted stadiometer and bioimpedance scale (Tanita Innerscan, Kewdale, Australia). body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the formula body mass index (BMI) = kg/m2.  2.4.2. Body Composition Assessment  Body composition was assessed using a whole-body dual x ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Discovery W, Hologic Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA). Measurements for visceral fat mass, lean body mass and fat mass were recorded for each participant.  2.5. Haemodynamic Assessment  2.5.1. Central and Peripheral Blood Pressure  Participants were instructed to lie comfortably in a supine position on a table and were fitted with pneumatic blood pressure cuffs on both their upper arm and thigh.",846fb9d0-8516-4d46-8ea7-e9fc3ffddcae
6,methods6," Following 10 min of rest and minimal movement, peripheral and central blood pressure was assessed using the SphygmoCor Xcel analyser (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia).  2.5.2. Pulse Wave Velocity  In the supine position, the carotid pulse, sternal notch, femoral pulse and position of the thigh cuff were measured for distance between landmarks and entered into the software (XCEL version 1.2.0.7, AtCor Medical, Australia) to provide the pulse wave distance. A tonometer was then placed over the carotid pulse until a steady pulse measurement was registered by the software, causing the thigh cuff to inflate automatically. The software then compared the pulse measurements to estimate the pulse wave velocity (m/s).  2.6. Aerobic Capacity (VO2) Testing  Participants abstained from eating for an hour prior to testing. A graded exercise test using a ramped workload protocol was performed on a magnetically braked cycle ergometer (Lode Excalibur, Lode B.V., The Netherlands).",83642b84-f0c7-47b0-a96d-32de83edec4a
7,methods7," Male participants began at a power output of 50 watts for three minutes after which the workload was increased incrementally by 50 watts every 3 min until 9 min, after which the load increased in 25 watts increments each minute until volitional fatigue. The female protocol varied in that the starting load was 25 watts and that all subsequent increases in load were 25 watts. Oxygen uptake (VO2) and respiratory exchange ratio (respiratory exchange ratio (RER)) were measured every 30 s. VO2peak was determined to have been achieved upon volitional fatigue or if two of the following criteria were met: a respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.15, an RPE score ≥ 19 and/or a peak heart rate within ±10 beats of the participants’ age predicted maximum (determined as: 220-age). Heart rate was continuously monitored with perceived exertion (Borg scale rating of perceived exertion) assessed during each interval.  2.7.

Following catheterisation, blood samples were taken before glucose ingestion (Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)), at 30 min, 60 min and 120 min. Baseline samples (prior to glucose ingestion) were used for all blood analysis, with samples taken after glucose ingestion used for glucose area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)). Serum tubes were left to sit for at least 20 min, but less than 40 min, to allow clotting. The samples were then centrifuged for 12 min at 3000 RPM to separate the serum. Serum was then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Plasma tubes were delivered on ice directly to an external commercial lab (Dorevitch Laboratories, Melbourne, Australia) for measurement of lipids, glucose and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).",42cfc80a-411b-46d6-80d0-5df67473cef9

Discussion  The primary aim of the present study was to determine if twice weekly intermittent fasting combined with high intensity exercise would provide superior benefits on weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic biomarkers compared to either intervention alone. The results showed that intermittent fasting with or without a 3-day/week sprint exercise training program provided similar effects on body composition (i.e., body fat and lean muscle mass) in overweight and obese individuals that were predominantly metabolically healthy. However, the effects on haemodynamic measures (i.e., blood pressure) and clinically relevant markers in lipids (i.e.",9ee87229-51f8-4973-8237-0ce559c3d265
20,methods20,", triglycerides and cholesterol) and glucose regulation (i.e., area under the curve (AUC), HOMA-IR) were mixed. A clear benefit from the addition of exercise to intermittent fasting was an improvement in aerobic capacity. Only exercise training alone and when combined with intermittent fasting improved aerobic capacity, with no change in the intermittent fasting only group. Despite such improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, this did not translate into benefits across all exercise groups in haemodynamic and clinically relevant markers. The study findings suggest that either intermittent fasting or intermittent fasting combined with sprint exercise training is effective at inducing weight loss, specifically body fat levels. However, maintenance or improvements in cardiovascular health would require exercise training.  The benefits of intermittent fasting on body composition are well established [11,28].",ad1184fa-7812-4be4-8782-0c63989cd7c2
21,methods21," While different variations of intermittent fasting exist, all involve extended periods of time with little or no nutritional intake. The 5:2 intermittent fasting protocol is a popular method which incorporates 2 days of fasting consuming only water (termed ‘zero-calorie’ fasting’) or, allowing 25% of energy needs (approximately 500 kcal per day) called ‘modified alternate day fasting (ADF)’, with days of unrestricted consumption [29,30]. Findings to date reveal that 5:2 diet is effective in reducing weight (4–8% loss from baseline) over the short-term period (8–12 weeks) in men and women with obesity [31,32,33]. However, longer-term studies (i.e., 52 weeks) demonstrate no greater reductions suggesting a peak in weight loss efficacy from this type of diet around 3 months [29,32,34]. Compared to daily calorie restriction, weight loss appears to be similar in both short-term [35] and long-term trials [36].",d20f696a-d962-4709-bda5-8dc66668a180
22,methods22," The present study supports the previous findings demonstrating comparable reductions in weight loss (~6%) in the IF only group over the 16-week period, where reductions in total energy intake in the range of 10–30% of total kilocalories consumed per day are evident.  Reductions in fat mass are the main contributor to weight loss following energy restricted diets [37]. In the present study, reduction in fat mass was approximately ~83% (~3.5 kg) of total weight loss, which is slightly higher than other studies [38,39]. Importantly, a high proportion of fat mass loss was from visceral fat, a region of fat that is more strongly correlated with ill health compared to others (i.e., subcutaneous). This has also been shown in other studies [32,38], though a recent review suggests the majority of weight is lost through reductions in subcutaneous fat mass [29].",1e7f2bbe-501c-451c-9ff7-5b3deb63d57c
23,methods23," An unfavourable consequence of energy restriction is loss of LBM, with around 25% of body weight loss in the form of lean muscle mass [37]. In the present study, LBM loss following intermittent fasting was less (~17.5%, ~0.8 kg) which may support previous suggestions that IF leads to greater attenuation of LBM loss compared to continuous energy restriction [40], though more recent evidence suggests otherwise [41]. On the contrary, reductions in LBM between energy-restricted diets could be dependent on the percentage of weight loss, with participants who lose more weight (i.e., >10% of their body weight) likely to lose greater amounts of LBM. Indeed, in the present study, IF only group lost on average 5% of their body weight at the end of the intervention, and this is a more likely reason for the less than typical loss of LBM while undertaking an energy restricted diet.",bd60f0c6-714a-4405-bb78-4b65af4188d5
24,methods24," A limitation of the current study is that we did not include a continuous energy restriction only group and thus we can only speculate on such reasons.  A common strategy to minimise loss in LBM and potentially promote muscle accrual is combining the energy restricted diet with exercise training, specifically resistance training [20]. Conversely, low volume HITT has been shown in a recent meta-analysis to be non-effective at increasing LBM when compared with non-exercising control [42]. Whilst most studies reviewed tended to favour an improvement in LBM with high intensity interval training (HIIT) versus moderate-intensity continuous training, this was not significant [42]. The results in the present study support these previous findings with no significant increase in LBM within the SIT only group. The combined effects of HITT and fasting on body composition have also been examined in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis [43].",246238a8-74d1-4b1c-b985-f85624f7da8e
25,methods25," Subgroup analysis found that compared to the control group (fasting alone or high intensity interval training (HIIT) alone), LBM was improved in the short-term (<4 weeks) when combined with HITT, whereas long-term (>4 weeks) the opposite was found [43]. However, given the majority of ‘intermittent fasting’ interventions included in the analysis were continuous calorie restriction and not fasting for prolonged periods, it is difficult to apply their findings to the present study results. A recent study did compare the effects of 8 weeks of HITT with or without daily intermittent fasting in the form of time restricted feeding on body composition and performance [44]. Predicted estimates of muscle mass was similar between interventions and unchanged over the 10 weeks. However, given the cross-over design of the study, different training volume (~40 min vs. ~10 min) and fasting type (twice weekly vs.",386d55e8-5007-4c3e-97b7-338703290646
26,methods26," daily time restricted) compared to the present study, it is again difficult to directly compare to the current study results.  Therefore, to our knowledge, no human study has investigated the combined effect of sprint exercise and 5:2 intermittent fasting on LBM and our results suggest that 10 min of sprint exercise, three times a week is not sufficient to attenuate LBM loss that may occur with intermittent fasting. Interestingly, LBM loss was (non-significantly) greater in the combined group compared to intermittent fasting alone (3.1% vs. 2.5%). Given body weight loss and fat loss were comparable between groups, it is unlikely to be a negative energy balance issue, which is known to impact muscle protein metabolism [45]. On the contrary, it is possible that insufficient protein intake, which is another major determinant of training-induced changes in LBM [46,47], could be a contributing factor, with intakes in the combined group just below or at RDA (0.8 g·kg·bw per day).",640f5a77-57d4-4a15-a0fa-0d367af5c5d8
27,methods27," While all groups were, on average, lower than the recommended 1.2 to 1.9 g·kg·bw per day recommended for LBM maintenance and accrual [46,48], both SIT and IF were higher compared to IF/SIT.  Combining IF with sprint exercise training did not result in greater weight loss and/or fat mass. While some studies suggest superior improvements in weight and/or fat loss when exercise is added to IF [49,50], others have shown no improvement when diet and exercise are combined [51]. In the present study, the combined exercise and diet intervention group was only superior to SIT only. Given little change in body weight in the SIT group, it is not surprising that no additional weight loss and/or fat loss was observed in the combined group when compared to IF only.",182869d1-8116-4e3c-bee0-d4375692290b
28,methods28," The findings in the SIT group confirm a recent meta-analysis suggesting low-volume high intensity interval training (HIIT) was no better in improving body weight and fat mass when compared with a non-exercising control or moderate-intensity continuous training (moderate intensity continuous training (MICT)), which is likely a reflection of high intensity interval training (HIIT) protocols characterised by low energy expenditure of ≤ 500 metabolic equivalent (metabolic equivalent (MET)).min per week (and associated time reduction) [42].  The effects of low volume high intensity interval training (HIIT)/SIT on cardiometabolic biomarkers in overweight and obese, but otherwise healthy individuals, are equivocal with some demonstrating improvements in blood pressure and fasting blood glucose levels [52,53] while others show no significant change in blood pressure, blood lipid levels, or glucose control [54].",70581496-cf96-4434-9385-e7a78ac1374f
29,methods29," Total workload ranged from 1 × 4-min at 90% HRmax to 12 × 1-min at 80–90% HRmax, which are higher volumes compared to the current study (4–6 × 20 s bouts). The lack of effect from low volume SIT on cardiometabolic biomarkers in the present study is unlikely due to the timeframe, with others suggesting at least 8–12 weeks is required for high intensity interval training (HIIT) to demonstrate a positive impact on physiological adaptations that improve cardiometabolic health in overweight/obese populations [55]. A possible explanation could be that most participants in the present study presented blood markers and blood pressure already within standard-range at baseline, thus reducing the likelihood of observing notable group differences [54]. In contrast, change from baseline analysis did reveal significant reductions in the IF/SIT group for the marker of glucose tolerance and LDL cholesterol levels.",7ef6f23c-a51a-410d-bb91-4427898ff301
30,methods30," While others have also shown benefits when an exercise program is combined with fasting [50], given the lack of effects from SIT only, it is likely that such metabolic benefits were driven by the fasting and/or weight loss noted in both IF and IF/SIT groups. Indeed, the IF group also demonstrated reductions in glucose area under the curve (AUC) and HOMA-IR, though they were not statistically significant.  A noticeable benefit of SIT in the present study was the cardiorespiratory fitness enhancement. Our results extend the evidence that low-volume high intensity interval training (HIIT) interventions are effective for enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness, despite requiring lower energy expenditure and volume compared to moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) [42]. Gist et al. [56] demonstrated an ~ 8% improvement in VO2max with SIT protocols, which was superior to non-exercising controls and equally effective to moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) in adults.",6c2e71f7-ea10-4f26-a6e1-8569e4e3360f
31,methods31," Research suggests that for every increase in estimated one metabolic equivalent (metabolic equivalent (MET), corresponding to oxygen consumption of 3.5 mL·kg−1·min−1), there is an associated ~15% reduction in cardiovascular disease risk [57]. Our results showed that SIT only and IF combined with SIT improved VO2peak by nearly one and two metabolic equivalent (MET)s, respectively, and thus could be providing additional benefits in disease risk reduction.  Dietary intake data revealed that all groups were in calorie deficit over the 16 weeks. While this is expected for IF and IF/SIT groups, this was not prescribed for the exercise only group. This could be in part a reflection of “participant/response bias” where participants that typically enrol into diet/exercise or weight loss trials are those already looking to lose weight and thus subconsciously reduce their calorie intake regardless of which group they are assigned too.",e29436f0-49b9-4d9d-8963-c5bfdeff6087
32,methods32," Despite the calorie reduction, the exercise only group did not lose significant weight. Whether the dietary log information provided by participants was a true reflection of what they were eating cannot be accurately determined; which is a limitation of using such tools [58]. Physical activity outside of study training (for SIT and IFSIT groups only) was similar over the 16 weeks with no significant changes or differences between groups reported.  Our study design is not without its limitations. We wanted to replicate a ‘real-world’ environment to determine feasibility of both diet and exercise interventions. Thus, participants were asked to undertake both diet and/or exercise programs in a free-living environment where their diet and exercise outside of the study trial was not tightly controlled but guided in the form of healthy eating recommendations and instructions to maintain normal physically activities during the 16 weeks.",0f963ccf-89b7-4696-a822-40dd492fa84a
33,methods33," While this doesn’t allow the benefits of either fasting and/or sprint exercise to be determined independently of weekly ‘energy balance’, it does allow us to observe any compensatory mechanisms that may occur as a result of either or both interventions which may also impact the benefits of such interventions on outcomes measured. In addition, given the small sample size in each group and low males participant numbers, we pooled together both sexes in the analysis. While there is evidence to suggest sex-specific responses to both interventions, especially in animal models [25], given the large proportion of one sex in each group and a similar number of different sexes within each group, it is unlikely such differences influenced results, but we cannot exclude this. Given the longitudinal nature of the study design, variations in menstrual cycles were not controlled for and thus any effects, if any, cannot be ruled out.",5badcbbf-4146-4750-8c9e-7dd58362f8f3
34,methods34," Finally, the SIT protocol used in the present study was selected based on evidence that as little as 10 min of high intensity exercise can improve metabolic health and aerobic capacity [23]. While this is true, recent evidence suggests that low-volume high intensity interval training (HIIT) does not impact body composition measures of total body fat mass, body fat percentage or lean body mass [42]. Thus, a greater volume was probably required to compare body compositional changes between the three different groups.  5. Conclusions  In summary, the present study showed that 5:2 IF with or without low volume SIT was effective in reducing body weight and fat mass in individuals with overweight and obesity. However, the combination of both did not further enhance such reductions when compared to IF alone. The benefits on lipid levels and markers of glucose regulation were minimal and likely driven by fasting and/or weight loss.",49502143-d7f5-4ce3-84d7-fb4b50ed5b7e
35,methods35," Sprint interval training alone also provided limited effects; however, a clear benefit was an improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness which indicates the workload stress of the training was sufficient to induce such adaptations. Therefore, combining both IF with exercise training is required to obtain benefits in both body composition and cardiometabolic relevant measures. Further research is required to determine the optimal balance between sufficient caloric reduction and/or exercise volume/intensity to induce superior benefits when both are combined, but also ensuring that each strategy is practical to follow and/or time-efficient to support compliance long-term.
