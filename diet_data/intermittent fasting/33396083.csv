0,methods0," 2.1. Design  This study was approved by the Intermountain Healthcare Institutional Review Board (1050163) and the trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02770313) prior to any subject enrollment. The design and primary results of the water only Fasting interventional (WONDERFUL) trial were previously published [9]. Briefly, subjects were randomized using a sequential block design to either intermittent fasting or an ad libitum control arm. The 24-h, water-only intermittent fasting regimen began with 4 weeks of twice-per-week fasting on non-consecutive days, followed by 22 weeks of once-per-week fasting. Intervention arm subjects ate ad libitum on non-fasting days. Subjects randomized to the control arm ate ad libitum according to their usual eating practices for 26 weeks in parallel to the intervention arm.",7053cd0c-2ef6-49c5-b6fd-10ef4b52b1ea
1,methods1," All subjects underwent physical exams and laboratory testing, reviewed fasting logs and any nonadherence, and completed questionnaires at baseline, 4 weeks, 13 weeks, and 26 weeks.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria were also previously published [9]. Inclusions consisted of enrolling males and non-pregnant females who were aged 21–70 years, were not taking a statin, were not taking any anti-diabetes medication, had one or more criteria for the metabolic syndrome (elevated glucose, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)), diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)), triglycerides, or low HDL-C) and had modestly elevated LDL-C ≥ 90 mg/dL that did not reach levels that would provide a clinical indication for a statin (or, if LDL-C did meet clinical guidelines, the subject had a contraindication to statins or had previously tried them and stopped due to intolerance).",f47be890-b112-470c-a77d-bc25628264a9
2,methods2," Exclusions included a prior diagnosis of a chronic disease (including coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 1 diabetes, dementia, immunodeficiency, and cancer), recent substantial history of deliberate fasting other than fasting for religious reasons, and (for females) being pregnant or lactating. If female participants were of child-bearing potential, they were required to commit to using study-defined contraception methods.  2.2. Baseline Study Variables and Outcomes  While biospecimens (plasma, DNA, RNA, stool) were collected and stored for future testing, this study utilized only clinical laboratory test results and physical exam findings from each subject visit.",c27161bb-287b-4e98-93bc-ae418f034d9b
3,methods3," Clinical testing included the complete blood count (CBC) panel (white blood cell (WBC) count, red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (mean corpuscular volume (MCV)), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)C), Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD, Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV, platelet count, and mean platelet volume (MPV)), insulin, glucose, and a lipid panel (total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides). Each of these data elements was measured at baseline and at each follow-up study visit.",1c57ab1f-6d49-4527-b176-38bffdd8f01f
4,methods4,"  Previously reported major findings of the trial included that the low-frequency intermittent fasting regimen decreased the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), a metabolic syndrome score (metabolic syndrome score (MSS)), and insulin, with modest, but only statistically suggestive, declines in glucose [9]. Changes in those four biomarkers (insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR, and metabolic syndrome score (MSS)) were examined as outcomes in this study, with insulin designated as the primary outcome of interest because it was most profoundly changed by intermittent fasting in the initial study results [9]. Changes in weight were also examined in this study. Each of these parameters were measured at baseline, 4 weeks, 13 weeks, and 26 weeks.  2.3. Statistical Considerations  Baseline characteristics of trial participants were examined overall and when stratified by Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD.",c8140b50-79df-49c8-9102-ef1aa4ff976c
5,methods5," Evaluation of the baseline data by randomized group assignment was conducted using Student’s T-test or the chi-square test, as appropriate. Association analyses comparing the intermittent fasting and control groups for changes in Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD, Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV, insulin, HOMA-IR, glucose, and metabolic syndrome score (MSS) used the intent-to-treat approach, and statistical tests were performed with Student’s T-test. The normality of distributions was evaluated with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test prior to analyses. Tests of statistical interaction were conducted using analysis of variance to examine the modification of the effect of intermittent fasting on the study outcomes by baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW). The Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD was used in the primary evaluation of effect modification due to evidence that it is more predictive of clinical outcomes than the Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV [17].",8337c5d4-6691-4070-813b-779c0b958f71
6,methods6," Correlation coefficients were calculated using Spearman’s correlation and were evaluated in the overall population. A p-value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant, and analyses utilized SPSS v26.0 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA).  3. Results  The median baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD was 42.6 fL (mean: intermittent fasting, 42.9 ± 3.1 fL; controls, 42.8 ± 2.1 fL), which median was used to stratify baseline characteristics (Table 1) and to evaluate interactions with intermittent fasting. In the water only Fasting interventional (WONDERFUL) trial [9], N = 71 subjects completed the 6-month follow-up and had complete blood count (CBC) data to be included in this study, with n = 18 fasting and n = 17 controls having Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD < 42.6 fL and n = 20 fasting and n = 16 controls having Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD ≥ 42.6 fL.",9942e571-0cf9-4b1b-b38a-dd82dc914884
7,methods7," The proportion of subjects with higher and lower Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD was similar between randomization groups (Table 1), while subjects with higher Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD were older and had higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV), higher MPV, and lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)C, and tended to have greater weight and higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).  Baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD and Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV were highly correlated (r = 0.645), and the average Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV was considerably elevated (p < 0.001) in the higher Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD group (Table 1). Baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD was also modestly correlated with age (r = 0.384) and baseline levels of red blood cell (RBC) count (r = −0.313), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (r = 0.405), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)C (r = −0.366), and MPV (r = 0.",8ca13bd0-f94e-4cf4-acdb-0007f4a4b922

The Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD change score was strongly correlated with the 26-week Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV change score (r = 0.753) but not correlated with 26-week changes in insulin (r = 0.183), glucose (r = 0.023), HOMA-IR (r = 0.111), metabolic syndrome score (MSS) (r = 0.169), or weight (r = −0.044).  Mean Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD levels at each timepoint are shown in Figure 1 stratified by trial randomization. No difference was found in the Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD change score (the change from baseline to 26 weeks) between intermittent fasting (1.27 ± 9.61) and controls (−0.37 ± 1.76, p = 0.34). An outlying value was identified in one subject in which the Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD rose 58.",b3b8df54-efec-46d1-adac-5244910b5519
9,methods9,"0 fL compared to baseline, and, when analysis was performed without that individual, the Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD change score remained not different between intermittent fasting (−0.27 ± 1.79) and controls (−0.37 ± 1.76, p = 0.81).  Figure 2a shows the interaction of baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD with intermittent fasting in modifying the trial intervention’s effect on 26-week insulin change scores. In subjects with lower baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD, the change in insulin was only modest in the intermittent fasting group compared to controls (Table 2), while the decline in insulin due to intermittent fasting was profound in subjects with higher Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD (Table 2), with a significant p-value for the interaction (p-interaction = 0.039).",052d634d-bfb9-4473-b813-1e167120e21e
10,methods10," Similar findings for the effect modification by Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD level on fasting were identified for 26-week change scores of HOMA-IR, glucose, and metabolic syndrome score (MSS) (Figure 2), although these differences were not as substantial as for insulin. Mean changes in HOMA-IR, glucose, and metabolic syndrome score (MSS) by Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD and intermittent fasting categorizations are shown in Table 2.  No interaction of baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD and intermittent fasting was found for 26-week changes in weight (p-interaction = 0.33), with weight changes in the lower Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD category (<42.6 fL) of −2.0 ± 5.0 kg for intermittent fasting and 0.8 ± 1.7 kg for controls, and similar weight changes in subjects with higher Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD (≥42.6 fL), with −1.4 ± 4.5 kg for fasting and −0.5 ± 4.6 kg for controls.",d16916f8-dd13-45fe-ad60-bc33aeb2e6d3
11,methods11," When the interaction was modified to examine the interaction of baseline weight (median: 103 kg) with intermittent fasting, no effect modification by baseline weight was found for changes in insulin (p-interaction = 0.13), glucose (p-interaction = 0.30), HOMA-IR (p-interaction = 0.14), or metabolic syndrome score (MSS) (p-interaction = 0.29).  No difference was found in the 26-week changes of Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV in intermittent fasting (−0.15 ± 0.55) versus controls (−0.11 ± 0.45, p = 0.76) (see Figure 3a). The interaction of baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV (low Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV: <13.2%, high Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV: ≥13.2%) with insulin (Figure 3b) had p-interaction = 0.046, showing a similar effect modification by baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV as was found by baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD.  4. Discussion  4.1.",17ec703e-5fe0-4ec1-89f5-5ffe6aa1ec2c
12,methods12," Summary of Findings  In subjects enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of intermittent fasting, cardiometabolic outcomes, including changes to insulin level and related factors, showed improvement to a greater extent by fasting among people with a higher baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW) than those with an Red cell distribution width (RDW) of less than the median. This effect modification was the case for both Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD and Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV. No changes in Red cell distribution width (RDW) measures, however, were observed over the 6-month study interventional period. No effect modification of Red cell distribution width (RDW) on intermittent fasting-related weight changes was found, and no interaction of intermittent fasting with baseline weight was observed.  4.2.",4ef33d3e-b660-42b6-9344-2d22151551de
13,methods13," Medical Context of Elevated Red cell distribution width (RDW)  The Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV was first reported to be a biomarker of poor health outcomes in an evaluation of the ability to predict mortality of all complete blood count (CBC) parameters [13]. Because of its connection to anemia and calculation from basic, well-established hematologic factors, Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV is abundantly available through clinical laboratory testing throughout the world. The Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD is also available on some hematology platforms today and provides similar or better ability to predict health outcomes [17].",6b7e50b3-270a-4cd6-af0d-f96b808032e0
14,methods14," While both Red cell distribution width (RDW) measures are expected to be elevated in patients with certain anemias and hemorrhagic conditions, Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV is also persistently elevated in people with renal failure, chronic pulmonary diseases, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and other venous and arterial thromboembolic conditions [16,22]. Red cell distribution width (RDW) levels in patients with those conditions also predict mortality and major adverse events [13,15,16,18,20].  Red cell distribution width (RDW) becomes chronically elevated through unknown mechanisms, which could involve inflammation, anemia, or nutritional deficiencies, among other potential pathways [16,18,20].",bf6bf830-80fd-48fb-b736-ba91fa426c9b
15,methods15," Red cell distribution width (RDW) is, however, a powerful independent predictor of health outcomes in risk prediction models that have adjusted for demographics, cardiometabolic risk factors, C-reactive protein, folate, vitamin B12, hemoglobin, iron deficiency, and other factors [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. Chronically elevated Red cell distribution width (RDW) may result from tissue-level hypoxemia or another fundamental homeostatic response to disease that stimulates early red blood cell (RBC) release from bone marrow, the delay of eryptosis, or both [17,22,23]. As such, Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a non-specific indicator of general health status that may indicate the existence of underlying, undiagnosed health problems for people free of chronic diseases and may reveal the severity of disease for people with diagnosed chronic conditions [16].",fbba5c3b-2c79-42e9-83f5-01a95993ebee
16,methods16," It may also provide insight into the ability of the human body to respond to external health insults, including infectious pathogens or traumatic harms [14,19] and could be an indicator of frailty. Fortunately, knowing the mechanism by which Red cell distribution width (RDW) metrics become elevated is not necessary for using them in guiding health practices.  4.3. Red cell distribution width (RDW) as an Effect Modifier  Intermittent fasting could be a therapeutic method that modifies health risks marked by elevated Red cell distribution width (RDW). Intermittent fasting reduces weight to a similar extent as caloric restriction in a variety of populations [1,2,3,4] and improves cardiometabolic factors in apparently healthy people and in patients with diagnosed metabolic disease [2,3,4,9]. Little attention in fasting research, though, has been paid to risk related to hematology factors such as Red cell distribution width (RDW).",e6070901-c081-4ea9-b2ad-427770960d80
17,methods17," One study examined acute changes in Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV but reported no effect of fasting in changing the level of Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV during the 24-h fast [21]. Because Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a powerful predictor of both disease onset and prognosis after disease diagnosis, if intermittent fasting induces long-term changes in Red cell distribution width (RDW), one implication could be that people with elevated Red cell distribution width (RDW) may benefit from targeted use of intermittent fasting. In part, this assumes that Red cell distribution width (RDW) is in the causal pathway of chronic diseases and that modifying it will reduce the risk of poor health outcomes.  Unfortunately, this study showed that both Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD and Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV were unchanged by the intermittent fasting regimen. These findings may disclose that fasting does not alter Red cell distribution width (RDW).",c6ff7580-96a8-489d-8ad7-3d9e2b32b258
18,methods18," No treatment has been identified that reduces Red cell distribution width (RDW), though, so it is not surprising that no change was observed herein. In contrast, this may have occurred because the low-frequency fasting regimen was insufficient to change Red cell distribution width (RDW) metrics, the intervention period of six months may have been too short to observe the changes, or the study population size was too small. Further investigation of the effects of intermittent fasting on Red cell distribution width (RDW) measures would help clarify if higher-intensity regimens, longer interventional periods, or larger sample sizes are needed to observe Red cell distribution width (RDW) changes.  Because Red cell distribution width (RDW) as a biomarker can be used for prognostication of chronic disease development and adverse health events, its level at a single timepoint may identify individuals who could receive more benefit than others if they engage in intermittent fasting.",d0caea6a-7e69-47d0-b698-c3208f84b2cc
19,methods19," This is likely because people with a higher Red cell distribution width (RDW) have a greater need for improved health, especially in terms of insulin resistance. This study suggests that this is the case in which Red cell distribution width (RDW) is an effect modifier of intermittent fasting and can be used to guide decision making regarding therapeutic use of fasting and related applications, such as motivating patients to adhere to an intermittent fasting regimen. Given the vast literature on the powerful ability of Red cell distribution width (RDW) to predict future health outcomes, measurement of Red cell distribution width (RDW) may aid in personalizing the use of intermittent fasting to reduce risk of cardiometabolic disease and events.",b4b47e91-b134-4488-ba27-605c62dd8001
20,methods20," Potential mechanisms through which intermittent fasting reduces insulin, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome include that it causes weight loss [24], it results in the extraction of fatty acids from adipose storage for conversion to ketones to use as energy during cessation of caloric intake [25], and it may result in disposal of energy stores through mitochondrial uncoupling [26], among other mechanisms. Further study of the interaction of Red cell distribution width (RDW) together with intermittent fasting is indicated.  4.4. Limitations  This was a post hoc analysis of a clinical trial that was not designed to examine Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD or Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV in its primary analyses. Limitations of the trial have been examined previously [9] but include that some factors may have been uncontrolled by the randomization procedure, and findings should be interpreted with caution.",8c210f5a-4184-4188-af7b-e763a2a766c0
21,methods21," The study used a regimen that may have been insufficient to reduce Red cell distribution width (RDW) metrics, the sample size was relatively small, and detailed information on dietary intake was not collected, which did not permit examination of differences in nutrition over the course of the study. Red cell distribution width (RDW) is connected to nutrition through iron deficiency, which may connect to this study through changes in Red cell distribution width (RDW). Although no intermittent-fasting-related Red cell distribution width (RDW) changes were noted, Red cell distribution width (RDW) at baseline may have been higher in part due to iron deficiency but iron levels were not measured in this study. Further, the population that was studied consisted of people free of chronic diseases, with a few cardiometabolic risk factors and, thus, may not generalize to other populations.",a0b34811-9a81-4af4-8c42-eef8b974b0f5
22,methods22," Additional research regarding the findings is required to fully elucidate the relevance of Red cell distribution width (RDW) in intermittent fasting. The study did, however, discover a modification of the effect of intermittent fasting in subsets defined by the Red cell distribution width (RDW), and thus the low-frequency fasting regimen did affect certain parameters. Further, subjects in the control group followed their own standard dietary practices that approximate the standard Western diet and reflect real-life dietary behaviors.  5. Conclusions  In a post hoc analysis of the water only Fasting interventional (WONDERFUL) randomized controlled trial, intermittent fasting decreased insulin and other cardiometabolic traits relatively more in subjects whose baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW)-SD was elevated (≥median), potentially identifying which patients had greater need of the health intervention.",0b5402d6-e21c-4da8-bcb3-f71a2df446e1
23,methods23," This effect modification on fasting was also found using baseline Red cell distribution width (RDW)-CV. These findings suggest that people with greater risk of poor health outcomes, as indicated by Red cell distribution width (RDW) level, physiologically respond more to an intermittent fasting therapeutic intervention. Red cell distribution width (RDW) may be a readily available, low-cost biomarker for guiding the recommendation of a sustainable intermittent fasting regimen to a patient and a quantitative marker for nudging patients to adhere to intermittent fasting over the long term.",8a7ca94f-9377-41c9-af23-126d46c66b28
24,methods24," Further evaluation of the use of these and other metrics of red blood cell (RBC) size dispersion for personalization of intermittent fasting regimens is indicated, including to validate these findings in larger populations over longer intervention periods, to explore the value of using Red cell distribution width (RDW) measures to nudge patients to adhere to therapeutic fasting, and to identify people who may be at elevated risk of chronic diseases for whom an intermittent fasting regimen should be initiated because it may provide the largest benefit to them.
